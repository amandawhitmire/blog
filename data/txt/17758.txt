OBSERVATIONS SUR LA THEORIE GENERALE DES PHENOMENES 

 GLACIAIRES ET SUR LES GALETS STRIES. 



PAR STANISLAS MEUNIER. 



Ay ant ete depuis de longues annees appele a etudier d'une maniere 

 tres approfondie de nombreux types de glaciers et de regions presen- 

 tant des traces de glaciers maintenant disparus, il m'a paru qu'un 

 certain nombre d' assertions acceptees par la majorite des geologues 

 meritent d'etre soumises a une severe revision. 



La conclusion de mes recherches, poursuivies avec le plus grand 

 soin et avec le souci dominateur de me degager de toute opinion 

 precongue, m'a amene a contester quelques faits, qui sont cependant 

 classiques, et a leur substituer des notions qui cadrent beaucoup 

 mieux, suivant moi, avec les grandes lignes de I'economie planetaire. 

 J'ai eu souvent a recueillir a leur egard de precieux controles et 

 meme des verifications completes. 



L'idee qui ressortira des pages qu'on va lire, c'est qu'un glacier 

 considere a part est un appareil qui, tout en remplissant son role 

 dans la physiologic generale de la planete, est en proie, pour son 

 compte propre, aux progres d'une veritable evolution. II debute 

 dans une region qui offre les conditions favorables; il s'accroit au 

 fur et a mesure de I'amplification de ces circonstances hfeureuses; 

 il parvient ainsi a un moment d' apogee, apres lequel il traverse des 

 phases de declin, jusqu'au moment de sa disparition totale. Chemin 

 faisant, le glacier pent entrer en relation avec un glacier voisin et 

 s'engager avec lui dans une lutte ou competition, a laquelle il suc- 

 combe, ou dont, au contraire, il sort a son avantage. Dans un cas 

 comme dans I'autre, il en resulte pour son histoire des incidents qui 

 procurent I'explication de certaines circonstance, souvent mal com- 

 prises. Enfin, apres la cessation du glacier comme organe actif, 

 il laisse des vestiges de son existence passee, qui disparaissent pro- 

 gressivement, avec des details precieux pour la reconstitution des 

 conditions climateriques des epoques reculees. 



Cette etude de la Fonction glaciaire presentera cette particularite 

 de faire entrer en ligne de compte le role de toutes les autres fonc- 

 tions geologiques et de resserrer par consequent les liens entre des 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



chapitres de la Science qu'on a pris I'habitude de considerer comma 

 completement independants les uns des autres, 



§ I. L'Origine des Glaciers. 



La formation des glaciers suppose I'existence de deux conditions 

 tout a fait primordiales : 1° la continuite d'une temperature ambiante 

 inferieure a zero; 2° un sol suffisamment incline pour que la masse 

 compacte soit animee d'un mouvement continu de glissement. 



II resulte de la que, sous les latitudes oil la temperature moyenne 

 de I'annee est superieure a zero, un glacier ne pent se former que sur 

 des points du sol convenablement eleves et atteignant en consequence, 

 des zones atmospheriques suffisamment froides, en raison du degre 

 atmothermique. Cela peut s'exprimer en disant que I'origine des 

 glaciers dans les regions situees en dehors des zones polaires, est liee 

 directement a la surrection des montagnes, ou, si Ton aime mieux, 

 h I'exercice de la fonction corticale. 



On salt que la temperature de 1' atmosphere decroit regulierement, 

 a mesure que Ton s'eleve, de 1 degre par 185 metres. II en resulte 

 qu'a une certaine altitude, il n'y a plus de vapeur d'eau dans I'air, 

 mais seulement des particules glacees, des aiguilles cristallines qui se 

 comportent comme des poussieres atmospheriques et tombent lorsque 

 I'air est calme. Quand elles parviennent dans des zones inferieures 

 plus echauffee, elles se transforment en vapeurs et n'arrivent au sol 

 que par les temps d'hiver. 



Les sommets montagneux constituent des receptacles tout prepares 

 pour I'eau cristallisee, et, se couvrant de neige, deviennent, par 

 contre-coup, des centres de rayonnement de froid. 



Suivons done d'abord revolution des montagnes pour arriver a 

 celle des glaciers. 



Le grand Plateau centre — asiatique, d'une altitude de pres de 6,000 

 metres, represente les premieres'' etapes du phenomene de surrection 

 de montagnes assez hautes pour recevoir la neige, avec une consti- 

 tution tre5 eloignee de celle des montagnes proprement dites. 



II resulte de I'etude des echantillons rapportes au Museum Na- 

 tional d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris, par M. Bonvalot et le Prince 

 Henri d' Orleans, que les parties les plus hautes du massif Pamirien 

 consistent en assises jurassiques fossiliferes, qui n'ont aucune appa- 

 rence des roches metamorphiques. Ce sont des calcaires argileux 

 friables, tres ressemblants a ceux qui entrent dans la constitution 

 des regions frangaises les moins tourmentees, comme les departe- 

 ments du Calvados et de I'Yonne.

Leur transport vertical jusqu'aux altitudes oil ils atteignent 

 maintenant, est le resultat de " bossellements generaux," qui nous 

 apparaissent comme des contre-coups de travaux souterrains en 

 rapports directs avec la production des montagnes. La comparaison 

 avec maintes localites conduisent a une conception qui, bien que 

 tres directement connexe a Thistoire des glaciers, concerne cependant 

 avant tout le chapitre orogenique. C'est que le mecanisme d'oil 

 resultent les montagnes est harmoniquement subordonne au regime 

 general du globe qui doit traverser les phases successives d'une 

 evolution veritable; qui doit en outre proceder aux modifications de 

 son 6tat general, sans compromettre les conditions d'equilibre de la 

 surface, parmi lesquelles se signalent celles qui sont propres au 

 developpement de la vie. 



Sans y insister, il est digne de remarque que I'ecorce, forc6e de 

 suivre, dans sa contraction continue, le noyau fluide qui la supporte, 

 doit se refouler sur elle-meme, se doubler a la faveur de plis et de 

 charriages, sans qu'il en resulte pour la surface autre chose que des 

 tremblements de terre dont les plus graves ne determinent jamais 

 que des catastrophes locales, ne laissant apres elles aucune trace 

 geologique permanente. 



Aussi bien, on peut considerer un massif du genre du Pamir comme 

 contenant, en profondeur, une vraie chaine de montagnes qui s'est 

 soulevee lentement, apres sa constitution, au titre de simple detail 

 du grand ensemble en proie au bossellement general. II faudra, 

 pour que la montagne, caracterisee par sa structure brechiforme et 

 son etat metamorphique, apparaisse au jour, que des actions externes 

 la debarrassent de sa couverture de sediments ayant echappe aux 

 efforts mecaniques et aux actions calorifiques. De la, cette masse 

 formidable de debris rocheux, dont les montagnes sont toujours 

 entourees et dont le delay age et I'entrainement par les eaux pluviaires, 

 alimentent la sedimentation aqueuse. 



Bonvalot^ nous a donne la description de 1' erosion colossale dont 

 le plateau du Thibet est le theatre, du fait de la pluie et des autres 

 agents de I'intemperisme : ''Apres, dit-il, que la meige sera tombee 

 dans les mois qui suivront et que I'ete sera venu, le soleil fondra ces 

 reserves prodigieuses d'eau et ce sera, aux alentours de la chaine 

 Dupleix, une debacle de fin du monde. Une inondation diluvienne 

 deposera des lacs sur les hauts plateaux, les traversera de rivieres qui

 Paris 1892.

entraineront les boues epaisses et laisseront aux flancs des collines et 

 dans les anses, les debris des hauteurs. Ces depots restent la 

 jusqu'a I'ete suivant, car I'hiver arrete le cours des fleuves. Puis, 

 la chaleur du soleil agit; elle liquefie les masses solidifiees; celles-ci 

 s'ebranlent, coulent, s'emportent, reprennent les depots ou elles les 

 ont laisses a I'entree de I'hiver et les enlevent. D'annee en annee, 

 etape par etape, elles finissent par les charrier toujours plus bas, 

 sans cesse obstruant les vallees, elargissant les gorges, deviant les 

 fleuves, etalant les deltas. "^ 



Done, les masses superficielles seront successivement demantel6es, 

 puis supprimees et le massif orogenique, refoule et metamorphise, 

 se degagera comme le produit d'une gestation et d'une veritable 

 dehiscence de ses enveloppes protectrices. C'est comme un detail 

 necessaire du phenomene, que nous apparait la suppression des 

 portions superficielles d'un pays dont le sous-sol a ete refoule sou- 

 terrainement, par des successions generalement tres nombreuses de 

 seismes. 



iVjoutons que les observateurs sont d' accord pour voir avant tout 

 dans nos grandes chaines, Alpes, Pyrenees, Caucase, Himalaya, des 

 residus d'erosion pluviaire. On est alle parfois jusqu'a dire que les 

 Alpes ont du perdre de cette maniere, autant de substance qu'elles 

 en ont conserve. C'est au cours de cette suppression, que les chaines 

 sont devenues peu a peu de vraies montagnes et qu'elles ont apparu 

 au jour comme les "ossements composant le squelette de la terre" 

 selon une expression restee celebre. 



Disons en passant que le tremblement de terre est la cause efficiente 

 des montagnes qui, une fois edifiees par lui dans les profondeurs de 



2 Le Plateau thibetain, n'est pas plus une region glaciaire que la surface 

 plane de la Siberie, dans laquelle se trouve le point de temperature minimum de 

 toute la surface terrestre. Nous trouvons, quant au regime des neiges, un exemple 

 analogue dans la Terre de Grinnel, exploree par Greely, en 1889 (Voir: Dans les 

 Giaces ardiques, p. 270 in 8° Paris 1889). "Cette ile, situee par 82° de latitude 

 nord, est entouree d'une ceinture de glaciers et, malgre cette circonstance, elle 

 presente dans son interieur des regions relativement fertiles, oil paissent toute 

 I'annee de tres nombreux troupeaux de bceufs musques (Ovibos moschatus). 

 Suivant 1' expression du botaniste celebre, Joseph Hooker, la Terre de Grinnel a 

 "non pas un manteau, mais une ceinture de giaces." Et Greely ecrivait: "La 

 question des conditions physiques de I'interieur de la Terre de Grinnell est r(5solue 

 maintenant, comme Font fait pour la Terre Verte, les decouvertes de Nordens- 

 kjold." 



"Ces condition consistent, ajoute le voyageur, en ce que le terrain, montagneux 

 et abrupt, ne permet pas aux neiges abondantes de I'hiver de se maintenir long- 

 temps. De nombreuses vallees, longues et etroites, sont heriss^es d'une quantite 

 4norme de roches nues, dont les angles aident a concentrer la chaleur du soleil 

 pendant I'ete; ces vallees servent d'emissaires aux neiges fondues qui s'ecoulent 

 sur leurs falaises. Les rivieres de la saison chaude drainent le sol rapidement 

 et longtemps, avant le retour des fortes gelees, toute la neige a disparu. "

la croute terrestre, sont mises progressivement a decouvert, en 

 attendant qu'elles soient ulterieurement supprimees par le jeu des 

 actions externes, telles que la pluie et 1' Ocean. Exemple remar- 

 quable, par ses dimensions et par le contraste complet qui distinguent 

 les unes des autres ses differentes phases, de ces cycles innombrables 

 dont I'ensemble constitue toute la physiologic de la Terre. 



C'est aussi le procede par lequel s'elabore le genre de gisement 

 favorable a I'etablissement des glaciers. Et nous voici ramenes au 

 cceur meme de not re sujet. 



L'erosion s'attaquant a la surface des couches soulevees par un 

 bossellement general en meme temps que le noyau orogenique 

 q'elles recouvrent, en modifie progressivement la surface, d'abord 

 continue et uniforme comme celle des grands fonds de mer. Ce 

 travail, parallele a I'ceuvre de surrection qui pent se continuer 

 pendant des periodes geologiques entieres, favorise celle-ci en diminu- 

 ant peu a pen le poids de la matiere a soulever. 



§ 2. PouvoiR DE Transport des Glaciers. 



Le glacier est un merveilleux appareil de condensation de I'hu- 

 midite aerienne, qui s'y convertit en neige, puis se transforme en neve 

 et en glace. C'est en meme temps, un centre de dispersion aqueuse, 

 car il s'y fait une evaporation active, meme par le froid et surtout 

 quand le vent souffle. Cette activite qu'il manifeste dans I'atmos- 

 phere, le glacier la deploie sur le sol, en transportant des particules 

 rocheuses de toutes dimensions. Le poids n'intervient pas plus 

 que la densite relative des debris: toutes les pierres, meme les plus 

 grosses, sont portees sur le dos du glacier. Ces sortes de "flotteurs" 

 sont emportes comme les corps legers a la surface des rivieres, et ils 

 vont s'acumuler sur les berges en cordons longitudinaux ou moraines 

 laterales. 



II y a cependant des differences relativement aux cours d'eau, et 

 en particulier celles qui concernent les affluents ainsi que la terminaison 

 du glacier, comparable a I'embouchure. Le melange des filets prove- 

 nant de deux glaciers qui se confondent n'etant pas possible comme 

 celui des filets constitutifs des cours d'eau, les liseres mitoyens de 

 corps flottants s'associent en trainees longitudinales dites moraines 

 medianes. En outre, les corps mineraux portes jusqu'a la region de 

 fusion, au lieu de constituer un delta ou quelque sediment, s'accu- 

 mulent sans ordre en un bourrelet connu sous le nom de moraine 

 frontale et qui fait comme une fortification derriere laquelle le glacier 

 vient mourir. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



Enfin, les glaciers qui aboutissent a la mer precipitent de leur front 

 au fond de I'eau, des quantites de materiaux que les courants ne laissent 

 pas s'accumuler sous forme de moraine. Tries plus ou moins par 

 grosseur et etales en nappes qui prennent a certains egards I'allure 

 des sediments ordinaires, ils vont s'emmagasiner dans des fjords qui 

 finissent par en etre combles. Et les icebergs, detaches du front 

 terminal s'en vont, quelquefois fort loin, laissant tomber au fond 

 de la mer des debris rocheux, de gros blocs essentiellement erratiques. 



§ 3. Erosion glaciaire. 



L'erosion produite par le glacier est considerable et tres par- 

 ticuliere. II agit indirectement sur les formations qui I'environnent 

 en activant I'intemperisme, c'est-a-dire en donnant un grand volume 

 aux pluies et en provoquant des congelations locales qui desagregent 

 les roches. De plus, par sa facalte de transport, il prive constamment 

 les parties erodees de la protection des eboulis, si efficace ailleurs. 



Mais c'est surtout par son action directe sur sa vallee que le glacier 

 travaille a la demolition de la montagne. D'apres les observations 

 de Dollfus-Ausset,^ le glacier de I'Aar qui, avec ses affluents, n'a 

 qu'une surface de 60 kilometres carres, fournit par jour 100 metres 

 cubes de sable qui sont emportes par le torrent. L'ablation des 

 vallees par les glaciers est done bien superieure a celle que procluisent 

 la plupart des cours d'eau, a egale superficie de bassin. 



Le sol sous le glacier, subit une friction considerable du fait des 

 graviers et des pierrailles, veritable matelas interpose entre la glace 

 et le roc. M. Vallot^ a insiste sur ce fait que la voute gelee, a la Mer 

 de glace de Chamonix, n'est pas mouUe sur le sol, mais lui est simple- 

 ment tangente. Le torrent sous-glaciaire s'est menage un veritable 

 tunnel. 



L'efficacite erosive du glacier n'en fut pas moins longtemps con- 

 testee et n'est encore admise, par certains geologues, qu'avec des 

 restrictions et comme a regret. Lapparent, dont le Traite de Geologie 

 a la pretention de resumer Topinion generale, a ecrit en 1885 :^ " NuUe 

 part, on n'a vu les glaciers creuser, affouiller un lit compose de 

 roches clures, ni decouper leurs parois comme font les torrents . , . 

 Un glacier n'est done pas, comme un torrent, un instrument efficace 

 d'erosion . . . ; autant qu'on en pent juger, par ce qui se passe 

 aujourd'hui, un glacier ne cree pas sa vallee, etc ..."

En 1893, le meme auteur faisait parler autrement I'opinion gene- 

 rale i^ ''On a beaucoup discute, dit-il, sur la puissance d'erosion des 

 glaciers. Quelques-uns la croient considerable; d'autres seraient 

 portes a la regarder comme negligeable. La verite semble se trouver 

 entre ces deux extremes ... En principe, puisque le glacier est un 

 fleuve de glace dont Failure ne differe de celle des eaux courantes que 

 par une vitesse incomparablement moins grande, il doit comme les 

 fleuves tendre vers un profil d'equilibre et, tant que ce profil n'est 

 pas atteint, le pouvoir de la glace doit s'employer a modifier en 

 consequence la forme du lit . . . Meme les roches les plus dures 

 du fond ne peuvent echapper a cette action, car les blocs que trans- 

 porte la glace, pousses par une pression considerable, agissent sur le 

 fond et les parois comme de puissants outils, etc." 



II y a bien longtemps que, pour ma part, j'ai soutenu I'opinion 

 que les glaciers realisent par le frottement des pierrailles qu'ils entrain- 

 ent sur les roches qui les supportent, un energique travail d'erosion. 

 J'ecrivais en 1891 ■? 



"Deja j'ai eu bien souvent I'occasion de faire remarquer que la 

 zone des roches moutonnees au-dessus de la glace dans les glaciers des 

 Alpes et d'ailleurs, correspond a des points ou la glace ii' atteint plus, 

 justement parce que, grace a son action erosive, elle a penetre 

 verticalement dans la masse rocheuse sous-jacente. Elle est vrai- 

 ment comparable a une scie, entrant dans une piece de bois et qui 

 bientot se meut au-dessous des points qu'elle a scies precedemment 

 mais qui ne datent pas d'un temps ou sa lame aurait ete plus large." 



"Ceux qui, dit Tyndall^ ont soutenu que les glaciers creusent les 

 vallees, n'ont jamais dit, ni voulu dire, que ce fut le hec du glacier 

 qui agit dans ce cas. Pour le glacier de Morteratsch (Engadine), 

 le travail de creusement, qui s'effectue certainement dans des pro- 

 portions plus ou moins grandes, doit etre bien plus considerable en 

 haut qu'en bas du glacier. " 



La realite et I'importance de la denudation glaciaire est aujour- 

 d'hui reconnue par un grand nombre d'observateurs parmi lesquels 

 nous citerons M. Richter^ et M. W. Salomon.^"

L'attaque s'exerce meme aux depens des roches moutonnees. 

 En effet, dans des excursions sur la Mer de Glace, aux Fonts et au 

 Mauvais Pas, comme dans celles sur les glaciers de la Haute-Engadine 

 et de bien d'autres regions, j'ai ete frappe de ce fait que le poli des 

 roches moutonnees qui dominent la glace, n'est pas le meme a toutes 

 les hauteurs: meme de loin, on constate, tres nettement en bien des 

 poir+s, qu'il est de plus en plus imparfait, c'est-a-dire de plus en 

 plus altere, a mesure que Ton s'eleve. En outre, la limite superieure 

 des polls est loin d'etre aussi nette que la limite superieure du glacier 

 et on voit des lambeaux de roches polies separes de la masse generale 

 des roches moutonnees, situees plus bas. Ces circonstances curieuses 

 s'expliquent par la penetration verticale du glacier dans la masse 

 des roches qui le supportent, grace a un mecanisme identique, a 

 celui qui fait penetrer dans une pierre le fil emerise du lapidaire. 

 En effet, I'age des differentes parties du polissage est loin d'etre le 

 meme: les parties hautes sont plus anciennes que les autres et, en 

 consequence, elles ont eprouve plus longtemps Taction desagregeante 

 des intemperies; en meme temps que les roches moutonnees gagnent 

 par en bas, a cause de la penetration verticale du glacier dans le sol, 

 elles perdent par en haut, sous Tinfluence de I'intemperisme. On 

 pent done en conclure qu'elles ont pu jadis atteindre une altitude 

 encore plus haute que celle qu'on observe aujourd'hui. De sorte 

 que le procede employe d'ordinaire pour restaurer les anciens glaciers 

 devrait conduire a leur donner une dimension encore bien plus grande 

 qu'on ne la suppose. 



L'erosion glaciaire, soit directe, soit mediate, revet si l)ien tons 

 les traits essentiels de la denudation fluviaire, qu'elle affecte une 

 allure regressive, quant a son travail vertical, se traduisant par le 

 phenomena de Capture, que j'ai reconnu des 1897, et sur lequel nous 

 Teviendrons dans un moment. ^^ 



§ 4. Evolution des Glaciers. 



Les glaciers doivent leur origine au soulevement de la montagne, 

 j usque dans les regions atmospheriques de temperature suffisamment 

 basse; mais comme ils travaillent sans cesse a la demolir, elle subit 

 une diminution de volume et surtout de hauteur qui entraine le 

 rapetissement du glacier. La neige regue par le sommet etant 

 moins abondante, la glace qu'elle produit par sa compression ne 

 pent plus alimenter un courant aussi long que precedemment et le

glacier abandonne, devant son front, une moraine terminale qu'iL 

 ne pent plus atteindre. 



II ne faut pas confondre le recul des glaciers avec les variations 

 locales qu'ils subissent du fait de la meteorologie, par exemple a 

 la suite d'une serie d'hivers peu neigeux. Le recul des glaciers passe 

 par des alternatives, comme la mer descendante, dont la vague par- 

 fois semble regagner du terrain; le raccourcissement et I'allonge- 

 ment temporaire du glacier se perd dans 1' allure general du pheno- 

 mene, qui se retire peu a peu vers I'amont de la vallee, en laissant des 

 moraines successives, tres inegalement espacees, et entre lesquelles 

 le sol offre seulement une dissemination de debris rocheux de toutes 

 grosseurs: le terrain glaciaire eparpille contrastant avec le terrain 

 giaciaire amoncele, dont le type est la moraine. 



Le glacier qui diminue, change en meme temps de forme: il perd 

 la longue trainee qui descend vers les parties basses et se reduit a 

 la portion elargie des regions elevees. Les Pyrenees, montagnes 

 plus anciennes que les Alpes, et qui par consequent subissent I'erosion 

 depuis plus longtemps, nous offrent cette sorte de glaciers larges et 

 courts, s'arretant au haut de vallees etroites, dont les flancs sont en 

 beaucoup d'endroits parfaitement moutonnes et le long desquelles 

 se montrent des moraines transversales, echelonnees de distance en 

 distance, ce qui indique avec evidence que le glacier y a sejourne 

 dans I'intervalle de ses raccourcissements successifs. Imaginons les 

 Pyrenees remises en possession de tout ce qu'elles ont perdu depuis 

 leur soulevement, leurs sommets se retrouveraient dans les zones 

 atmospheriques de fortes condensations neigeuses, et les cirques, 

 mieux alimentes, reconstitueraient des glaciers semblables a ceux 

 des Alpes. 



Apres le stade alpestre et le stade pyreneen, nous arrivons au stade 

 vosgien. 



Si Ton part de la petite ville de La Bresse, pour remonter la vallee 

 du Chajoux, en se rapprochant du sommet de Hohneck, on se trouve 

 d'abord en presence de particularites topographiques tout a fait 

 comparables a celles que nous offre le bas des vallees des Pyrenees. 

 De magnifiques moraines se presentent aux regards, d'autant plus 

 faciles a reconnaitre qu'elles ont ete recoupees par la riviere et 

 entaillees pour le passage de la route. Sur le flanc des coteaux,, 

 accidentellement depouilles du sol arable, on apergoit des surfaces 

 de roches nettenjent moutonnees. Mais, on a beau continuer son 

 ascension, jusqu'au lac de Lispach, qui s'est etabli derriere un 

 barrage morainique, et meme arriver au sommet du Hohneck, on ne

rencontre pas le moindre vestige de glace. Des plaques de neige 

 pourront se voir encore jusqu'en aout, dans les creux abrites du soleil; 

 mais en septembre, elles auront toutes fondu. Pour qu'elles persis- 

 tassent, il suffirait d'un bien faible exhaussement des Vosges, d'une 

 restitution a la chaine d'une partie seulement des inateriaux que 

 I'erosion lui a arraches et qui gisent, a I'etat de moraines, dans la 

 vallee du Chajoux et dans toutes les autres vallees qui rayonnent en 

 tous sens. 



Les Vosges ont ete comme les Pyrenees ; les Pyrenees seront comme 

 les Vosges. 



Certaines autres regions frangaises, comme la Bretagne, le Cotentin, 

 I'Auvergne, privees de glace et souvent meme de moraines, ont cepend- 

 ant possede des glaciers. On y rencontre en effet, a la surface de ter- 

 rains varies, des blocs erratiques, semblables a ceux que charrient les 

 glaciers et qu'ils abandonnent a leur moraine terminale. La deter- 

 mination parait d'autant plus legitime que les monts d'Arree, par 

 exemple, malgre leur altitude actuelle de simples collines, se revelent 

 par leur structure caracterisee, comme les residus d'erosion d'une 

 chaine primitivement batie sur le modele des Alpes. L'intem- 

 perisme a disperse les moraines, attac^ue les surfaces polies des roches 

 moutonnees; il a laisse, provisoirement, quelques gros fragments 

 rocheux particulierement resistants. 



L'appareil glaciaire s'est done developpe successivement dans les 

 differents massifs montagneux, chaque fois que ceux-ci ont presente 

 une altitude suffiisante pour y assurer la persistance de la neige. 

 Successivement, les centres glaciaires ont occupe des regions diffe- 

 rentes,. et Ton pent croire qu'au total, les diverses epoques se sont 

 tres intimement ressemble par le nombre et par le volume des glaciers 

 developpes durant chacune d'elles et seulement repartis differemment. 



U emigration des glaciers, comparable a I'emigration des continents 

 mais dont la chronologic est plus difficile, faute de fossiles permet- 

 tant de les dater, doit etre substituee a la conception d'une epoque 

 glaciaire, dans laquelle les diverses traces glaciaires seraient contem- 

 poraines les unes des autres, ou il y aurait eu beaucoup plus de glaciers 

 que dans aucun autre temps, ce qui est essentiellement contraire a 

 la marche, si evidemment continue et uniforme, de revolution de la 

 surface terrestre. 



La capture des glaciers est un point particulier et d'un haut interet 

 de leur evolution. La capture est une analogic de plus, entre les 

 cours d'eau solidifiee et les rivieres. Comme ces dernieres, des glaciers 

 voisins doivent necessairement reagir les uns sur les autres.

Imaginons deux glaciers A et B, remplissant deux vallees orientees 

 a angle plus ou moins ouvert I'une sur 1' autre, et disposees de telle 

 sorte que le bassin superieur de A soit separe de la partie moyenne de 

 B par une cloison rocheuse peu epaisse, la pente de A etant plus 

 accentuee que celle de B. Dans ces conditions, la regression de tout 

 I'ensemble du glacier A, amene Tamincissement de la cloison separa- 

 trice en B, et plusieurs voyageurs ont directement observe le pheno- 

 mene et en ont decrit les progres, conune sir Martin Conway, en 1898, 

 pour le Spitzberg,i2 et M. Williard D. Johnson, pour les Etats-Unis, 

 en 1899.^'^ Lorsque la destruction de cette cloison s'est enfin realisee, 

 et qu'alors le glacier A, en consequence de sa pente plus forte, exerce 

 une veritable succion sur la glace de B et la derive a son profit, B est 

 desapite, pour adopter I'expression employee a Tegarcl des cours d'eau, 

 et A a realise la capture de la portion superieure de B. 



Le glacier A, conforraement a la loi generale, avait subi une 

 diminution consecutive a I'abaissement de son bassin d'alimentation 

 sous I'influence de I'erosion; il avait abandonne sa moraine frontale 

 et en avait edifie de nouvelles en arriere de celle-la ; sur le terrain 

 glaciaire eparpille, s'etait etabli alors un regime continental ordinaire: 

 production d'un etang ou d'une tourbiere, avec debris organiques 

 enfouis, animaux et vegetaux. Mais voici la capture qui a lieu: 

 une nouvelle contribution de glace vient s'aj outer au volume du 

 glacier: il se gonfle, passe par dessus sa moraine frontale qu'il ecrase 

 et transforme en moraine profonde, s'avance sur la tourbiere ou sur 

 I'etang, en recouvre les formations de son depot eparpille et recupere 

 sa dimension primitive qu'il pent meme depasser. 



Puis la diminution ineluctable reprend ses droits; le glacier recule 

 de nouveau et finalement disparait. Et si Ton est mis en presence 

 d'une coupe du sol, interessant les diverses formations dont nous 

 avons resume la production successive, on y verra: une assise fos- 

 silifere, argileuse ou tourbeuse, contenant des coquilles lacustres, 

 des animaux et des vegetaux terrestres, intercalee entre deux niveaux 

 glaciaires: I'inferieur datant de revolution propre du glacier A, le 

 superieur se rapportant au retour de ce glacier, enrichi par la capture. 



Ces conditions se retrouvent dans un grand nombre de localites, 

 par exemple a Diirtein, a Utznach, a Wetzikon aupres de Zurich.

Bellegarde, y a reconnu les traces de plusieurs recurrences glaciaires 

 separees par des depots d' alluvions, indiquant plusieurs cycles 

 d'erosion successifs. En effet, le nombre des nappes morainiques 

 superposees pent etre superieur a 2, par exemple de 3 ou de 4, ou 

 meme de 6, comme on le constate en certains points de I'Angleterre. 

 Le fait tient au nombre de glaciers situes dans un meme massif • 

 montagneux et qui ont pu entrer en communication. 



Comment tous ces faits ne nous mettraient-ils pas en garde contre 

 le danger evident qu'il y aurait a regarder les diminutions et les 

 accroissements alternatifs de deux glaciers differents, comme ayant ete 

 exactement concordants dans le temps, c'est-a-dire non pas seulement 

 de la meme epoque geologique, mais du meme instant precis. C'est 

 cependant parce qu'on eut cette idee inacceptable qu'on a cru a 

 I'existence de periodes alternatives de grandes extensions et de 

 reculs des glaciers. Manifestement il faut renoncer a cette conception 

 qui restera dans I'histoire de la Science, comme le temoignage d'un 

 moment d'aveuglement. 



§ 5. Le Grand Phenomene erratique du Nord. 



Nous Savons que les glaciers polaires, aboutissant a la mer, ne 

 peuvent se construire de moraines, mais qu'ils deposent le long de la 

 cote, sous les eaux, une epaisse formations sedimentaire, et que chemin 

 f aisant, les icebergs entratnes par les courants, parsement le fond de la 

 mer de limons, de sables, de graviers, de pierres, quelquefois d'un 

 volume considerable. Ce phenomene, qui s'est produit aux epoques 

 geologiques immediatement anterieures a la notre, a imprime un car- 

 actere particulier au sol de vastes regions. L^ne partie de 1' Europe, 

 constituant comme une aureole autour de la Scandinavieet comprenant 

 une large bande de I'Allemagne et de la Russie de I'Ouest dont le sol 

 est relativement tres recent, est couverte de materiaux eparpilles 

 offrant le caractere glaciaire. Ceux-ci consistent en debris et parfois 

 en tres gros blocs de roches fort anciennes. Parmi ces roches, il en 

 est de si reconnaissables qu'il est facile de determiner leur lieu d'ori- 

 gine. Dans le nombre sont des calcaires a Orthoceres venant, sans 

 aucun doute, de I'ile de Gothland, dans la mer Baltique, et des 

 syenites zirconiennes, qui ont ete arrachees aux rochers des environs 

 de Christiana: les uns et les autres ont ete transportes jusqu aux 

 alentours de Berlin. La disposition des lieux est telle qu'on doit voir 

 dans la dispersion de ces materiaux, le resultat de la dispersion 

 d'icebergs ayant leur point de depart dans les Alpes Scandinaves et 

 datant d'une epoque ou ces montagnes etaient couvertes de glaciers 




14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



pendant que les pays sur lesquels s'est etale le ''grand phenomene 

 erratique du Nord" etaient submerges sous les flots d'une mer 

 recevant les tetes des glaciers suedois. 



La persistance d'un semblable phenomene a travers des periodes 

 geologiques successives s'explique par un simple deplacement de la 

 localite ou il se developpe. Si I'Atlantique venait un jour a se 

 dessecher par suite du soulevement de son fond au-dessus du niveau 

 des mers, la ressemblance des effets qui s'y developpent aujourd'hui 

 avec ceux qui ont pris naissance anterieurement en AUemagne et en 

 Russie pourrait porter a faire admettre que les deux regions ont ete 

 soumises en meme temps au phenomene glaciaire; et I'erreur, cette 

 fois si manifeste, accentuera nos remarques de tout a I'heure sur la 

 non-contemporaneite des moraines ou des roches moutonnees, des 

 diverses regions continentales. 



Les traces du grand phenomene erratique se retrouvent en Amerique 

 du Nord comme en Europe. II irradie des sommets montagneux du 

 Canada, qui se revelent ainsi comme ayant, dans le passe, porte des 

 glaciers aboutissant a un ocean etendu, clans ce temps-la, sur les 

 Etats-Unis. 



Si Ton ne voyait pas I'Atlantique a I'oeuvre et si Ton ne connaissait 

 que les regions europeennes et americaines couvertes de terrains 

 erratiques, on ne ferait nuUe difficulte de supposer qu'elles ont acquis 

 leurs caracteres speciaux dans un meme moment. La notion fournie 

 par I'existence de I'Atlantique montre comment I'opinion contraire 

 est plus vraisemblable et meme comment il n'y a aucune raison de 

 croire que toute la region europeenne d'une part, et que toute la 

 region americaine de I'autre, aient subi le phenomene erratique 

 chacune d'un seul coup. Tout porte a admettre que la cause de 

 dispersion des icebergs a du se deplacer avec le temps, en consequence 

 de la propagation progressive des bossellements generaux et de 

 I'emigration de la mer. 



II. 



La Question des Galets stries. 



La plupart de nos lecteurs verraient sans tloute une lacune impar- 

 donnable dans I'oubli des galets stries parmi la serie des caracteres 

 propres aux formations glaciaires. K. von Zittel, cet esprit d'ordi- 

 naire si judicieux, est alle jusqu'a dire: "L'indice le plus infaillible 

 de I'origine glaciaire d'une formation se trouve dans la presence des 

 cailloux stries. On ne rencontre que tres rarement des stries sur des 

 fragments de roches cristallisees, de gres quarteux et de jaspe; par 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



centre, elles se font voir de la maniere la plus reconnaissable sur les 

 fragments calcaires, particulierement sur ceux de couleur sombre. 

 Dans une moraine profonde qui n'a pas ete remaniee et lavee par les 

 eaux, presque tons les cailloux calcaires portent des stries qui souvent 

 sont aussi profondes que si elles avaient ete gravees avec un burin. "^^ 



Tout le monde a peu pres, etait en ce temps la du meme avis, et 

 cette quasi-unanimite en imposait assez aux dissidents pour qu'ils 

 conservassent in petto les objections qui se presentaient a leur esprit. 



On s'explique d'ailleurs jusqu'a un certain point I'erreur qui 

 consiste a attribuer aux stries des galets une origine glaciaire et Ton 

 comprend qu'une fois I'erreur commise on ait tenu d'instinct a la 

 conserver, parce qu'elle semblait un guide commode dans la recon- 

 stitution de I'histoire geologique des glaciers. 



Quant au premier de ces deux points de vue, il faut reconnaitre 

 que c'est surtout dans la masse des depots glaciaires, et avant tout 

 dans les moraines, que les galets stries ont ete observes. Par exemple, 

 c'est sur les moraines des Vosges qu' Ed. CoUomb^^ a fait les obser- 

 vations, pour ainsi dire initiales, qui ont ete completees par des 

 experiences, prouvant que les galets stries passent a I'etat de galets 

 ordinaires, quand on les sommet a un frottement semblable a celui 

 qui se developpe dans le lit d'un cours d'eau. 



On a conclu de ces observations qu'un glacier constitue un appareil 

 des plus fragiles et que sa disparition totale doit suivre immediate- 

 ment I'envahissement par la mer de la region ou il existait. 



La premiere action des fiots a ete sans aucun doute de demanteler 

 les moraines et d'en laver les materiaux heterogenes. Le frottement 

 leur a fait perdre les traits morphologiques qui pouvaient leur etre 

 caracteristiques et le balancement des eaux les a repartis rapidement 

 en depots parfaitement classes, parfaitement distincts les uns des 

 autres et n' ay ant plus rien qui puisse les distinguer des sediments 

 ordinaires. 



D'un autre cote, comme on retrouve des galets stries au sein de 

 formations geologiques d'ages tres divers, on a ete enchante, et a 

 bon droit, de croire a leur autorite pour reveler Taction glaciaire a 

 tous les moments de la vie de la Terre. 



La premiere fois que j'ai eu des doutes sur I'origine glaciaire des 

 stries, j'en ai ressenti une espece de consternation et j'ai fait tout

 1847. 




16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



au monde pour ne pas ceder a I'invitation, que semblaient me faire 

 certaines particularites des Prealpes vaudoises, de me mettre en 

 dissentiment avec I'immense majorite des geologues. Deja, j 'avals 

 provoque des resistances a I'occasion de bien des sujets differents, 

 tels que la doctrine de la sedimentation souterralne qui me parait 

 cependant de plus en plus legltme; tels que rorlglne, par reactions 

 gazeuses, des roches sUlcatees magneslennes de consolidation primi- 

 tive; tels que la capture des glaciers; tels que le mode de creusement 

 des vallees par les rivieres et la constitution du diluvium; tels que 

 le fait des relations stratigraphiques reciproques des divers types de 

 meteorites; tels que beaucoup d'autres qu'il n'est pas necessalre de 

 rappeler. 



Je dols avouer que j'eus un moment d'hesitation avant de me 

 lancer dans I'exposition des falts qui me condulsirent a affirmer que, 

 si dans les Prealpes vaudolses, d'anclens glaciers ont existe, ce qui 

 est bien possible, Us n'ont lalsse aucune trace de leur existence. En 

 d'autres termes, que tous les accidents conslderes comme des temolg- 

 nages de I'anclenne existence des glaciers dans le pays, se rattachent 

 avec evidence a des causes toutes differentes, et ne comportent pas 

 les consequences generales qu'on a cru pouvolr tlrer de leur etude. 



Je n'entreral pas lei dans le detail de mes recherches, et je donnerai 

 seulement deux observations. 



Des specimens recueillis au pled des Pleiades, au-dessus du village 

 de Blonay, a 4 kilometres au N. de Vevey (Suisse), consistent en- 

 galets de calcaire poll, presentant une prodlgleuse abondance de 

 stries et une extreme variete dans leurs directions. Toutes les faces 

 "de ces galets sont striees en tous sens. En outre, tous les galets 

 calcalres contenus dans le sol sont semblables a ceux-ci par I'etat de 

 leur surface; mais les roches plus dures, gres, granulltes, serpentine, 

 etc., ne sont pas striees ou ne le sont que d'une maniere exceptionnelle 

 et avec parcimonie. 



Or, si les stries etalent I'oeuvre du glacier, leur orientation generale 

 devrait indlquer celle de la presslon supposee; mais elles sont egale- 

 ment norabreuses dans tous les sens possibles. D'ailleurs, la presslon 

 du terrain, aussi forte qu'on pulsse la supposer, ne saurait produire 

 que des stries assoclees a des ecrasements de beaucoup preponderants, 

 et c'est ce que demontre I'experience. 



Une autre remarque qui, a elle seule, semble reduire a neant 

 I'hypothese que les stries des galets calcalres sont dus a Taction des 

 glaciers, c'est que si telle etait en effet leur origine, si par consequent 

 elles datalent d'une antiqulte de quelques milllers d'annees seulement, 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



(et dans le pays de Vevey ce n'est pas assez dire), elles auraient 

 depuis longtemps disparu par le fait de la corrosion realisee par les 

 eaux d' infiltration. J'ai fait disparaitre en moins d'un an le poll et 

 la plupart des stries de galets que j 'avals abandonnes dans la terre 

 vegetale a toutes les alternatives saisonnieres. 



Une coupe rencontree sur la rive droite du torrent appele la Bale 

 de Clarens, qui descend du pied S. 0. du Mont Folly, pour se jeter 

 dans le lac Leman, m'a procure des observations dignes de mention. 

 Les travaux d'une route joignant Blonay a Charnex, avaient necessite 

 I'ouverture d'un enorme placage de terrain caillouteux, recoupe 

 en face de Brent, suivant la pente du sol, par une tranchee de 200 

 metres de longueur et dont les parois montraient le contact d'une 

 surface tres inclinee de roches schisteuses, avec recouvrement epais 

 de terrain caillouteux. 



Cette ligne de contact est tres inegalement inclinee selon les 

 points: tandis que, dans certaines de ses parties, elle plonge tres 

 vite, dans d'autres, au contraire, elle est bien moins eloignee de la 

 direction horizontale. Et la consequence, c'est que les eaux d'infil- 

 tration ruissellent dans la masse avec une activite tres inegale ici 

 et la, et que le travail de la denudation souterraine est d'etre loin 

 d'etre uniforme d'un point a I'autre. 



Dans le premier cas, et toutes choses egales d'ailleurs, on voit la 

 boue beaucoup moins abondante, pendant que les galets calcaires 

 sont tres exactement polls et tres richement stries; au contraire, 

 dans I'autre cas, on observe des intervalles de niveaux limoneux et 

 un exces de boue qui, bien loin de presenter la structure des moraines, 

 permet de retrouver des formes de deltas superposes. En meme 

 temps, on reconnait que les stries font a pen pres defaut sur les galets 

 calcaires. 



Nous avons prononce les mots "denudation souterraine." C'est 

 la qu'en effet, est la cause des stries sur les galets calcaires. 



Beaucoup des caracteres morphologiques de la surface du sol lui 

 viennent d' actions souterraines dont ils sont le contre-coup. 



Une partie des eaux courantes s'infiltre dans la terre vegetale 

 pour s'ecouler a la surface de la roche sous-jacente. Quand la pente 

 est convenable, I'ecoulement determine, I'usure de ce substratum, 

 et des reseaux de depression allonges se produisent avec I'apparence 

 de vallees sans cours d'eau visible. Le manteau de sol arable 

 s'affaisse peu a peu au cours de ce travail, sans cesser de persister, 

 et tout en etant le siege d'un renouvellement incessant de toutes ses 

 particules.

18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Dans les pays a forte pente, cette denudation souterraine, toute 

 voisine de la surface du sol, prend des caracteres extremement 

 interessants. Pour observer les faits avec leur maximum de nettete 

 il faut choisir une localite dont la roche vive soit recouverte de ces 

 placages boueux a pierrailles de toutes les grosseurs, comme dans 

 I'exemple que nous venons de citer. 



Ces placages, quoique a base argileuse, sont cependant bien 

 permeables, a cause du sable quartzeux qu'ils contiennent en pro- 

 portion tres notable et des blocs rocheux qui y sont dissemines; 

 aussi I'eau d'infiltration y circule-t-elle avec une assez grande facilite. 

 Sous rinfluence du liquide en mouvement, le terrain subit des 

 pertes qui derivent, les unes d'une dissolution de substances calcaires 

 dans I'aeide carbonique de I'eau de pluie, les autres d'un entrainement 

 mecanique de particules argileuses qui troublent I'eau d'une fagon 

 tres visible a la base des pentes et la rendent meme tout a fait boueuse, 

 quand les pluies sont fortes et prolongees. 



La perte de matiere qui provient de cette double cause est tres 

 notable et elle determine necessairement un tassement sur elle-meme 

 de la matiere restante, qui glisse en meme temps sur la roche suppor- 

 tant le placage boueux et qui, comme nous I'avons vu, est ici forte- 

 ment inclinee. 



Dans ce mouvement de contraction du terrain, il s'inflige pour 

 ainsi dire a lui-meme une nouvelle forme de la denudation souterraine. 

 A cause de son heterogeneite, le deplacement relatif de ses grains 

 durs et de ses elements plus tendres amene I'usure de ceux-ci, et 

 souvent cette usure se manifeste par 1' acquisition de details mor- 

 pholologiques des plus remarquables. 



Les grains de quartz de toutes grosseurs, se mouvant tres lente- 

 ment, mais d'une maniere continue, contre les fragments calcaires, 

 contribuent a les user. 



Ces fragments calcaires, d'abord tres anguleux, comme on le voit 

 dans les parties hautes de la region, s'emoussent peu a peu sous 

 rinfluence des actions si bien connues et qui tendent a supprimer 

 dans les roches qui les subissent toutes les parties saillantes pour y 

 substituer des contours arondis. Si bien qu'un cube ne tarderait 

 pas a passer a une sphere plus ou moins parfaite et que des polyedres 

 quelconques marchent vers I'etat d'ellipsoides. II y a longtemps 

 que j'ai insiste sur ce mode de production de galets sans charriage.^'' 

 Dans nos placages boueux, Taction d'emoussement du a I'eau

souterraine et qui fait peu a peu des galets avec des blocs anguleux, 

 se complique de la collaboration de ce deplacement intestin des 

 grains de quartz par rapport aux debris calcaires sous I'influence de 

 la denudation souterraine. 



En consequence de la soustraction de substance soluble ou entrain- 

 able realisee par I'eau d'infiltration, ces petits grains de quartz se 

 meuvent sur la surface des blocs, lentement mais d'une fagon continue, 

 et avec une pression qui est mesuree par le poids du terrain superpose. 

 II en resulte que les surfaces convenablement tendres et avant tout, 

 les surfaces de calcaire compacte, se polissent veritablement : comme 

 elles se poliraient sous I'influence d'une molette, dans un atelier de 

 marbrier. 



Ce poli se renouvelle sans cesse : un galet poll enfoui dans la terre 

 arable exposee a la pluie perd en tres peu de temps sa surface carac- 

 teristique, il se ternit, il se corrode. Et c'est pour cela que nous 

 pouvions tout a I'heure dire que, si de semblables galets avaient ete 

 polls par les glaciers quaternaires dans les placages ou on les trouve 

 maintenant, il y a un temps incalculable qu'ils auraient perdu le poli 

 auquel on pretend les reconnaitre. Mais dans leurs gisements, a 

 mesure qu'ils sont attaques, ils se polissent de nouveau et cela sans 

 arret. Si la grande masse des petits grains quartzeux arrive a polir et 

 a entretenir polls sous toutes leurs faces, les galets calcaires contenus 

 dans les placages boueux des Prealpes, certains grains de meme 

 nature, mais de plus forte dimension, y impriment leur contact sous 

 la forme de stries ou de rainures plus ou moins longues et plus ou 

 moins profondes. Or c'est a cause des cailloux stries que certains 

 geologues ont essaye de faire considerer les placages boueux des 

 Prealpes comme etant d'origine glaciaire. Mais il y a impossibilite 

 a soutenir cette opinion, par les memes raisons invoquees deja a 

 I'occasion des galets observes dans la masse d'anciennes moraines 

 comme celles des Vosges. L'une des plus determinante, c'est I'abon- 

 dance meme des stries, leur presence sur tous les galets calcaires sans 

 exception et sur toutes les faces de ces galets. Involontairement, 

 et malgre le respect que doit nous inspirer le nom de certains des 

 geologues glacialistes que nous combattons, on ne pent se defendre 

 d'un certain etonnement -quant au succes d'une doctrine si insoute- 

 nable. 



Les efTets de denudation observes a la surface des galets glacaires 

 se retrouvent, avec les variantes qu'on pent pre voir, a la surface des 

 roches calcaires sous-jacentes a certains placages boueux. 



Le deplacement lent et incessant, sous une pression notable, des 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



grains de quartz au contact de calcaire compacte, a necessairement 

 use celui-ci; toutes les asperites y sont remplacees par de moUes 

 ondulations, par une forme moutonnee pareille a celle que les glaciers 

 ont donnee aux roches qui ont subi leur friction. En vertu des 

 circonstances mentionnees pour les galets, la surface moutonnee a 

 ete en meme temps tres exactement polie, et son poll est renouvele 

 constamment comme celui des galets. Enfin, cette roche a ete, 

 comme les galets encore, pourvue de stries et de sillons plus ou moins 

 longs, plus ou moins nombreux, et tout cet ensemble reproduit dans 

 ses traits generaux les efYets determines par le passage des glaciers; — 

 car il va sans dire que si les galets sont impuissants a strier les galets, 

 ils sont au contraire tres aptes a strier, a canneler et a polir les roches 

 en place qui les supportent. 



Mais un fait montrera a lui seul qu'il y a en jeu une cause essen- 

 tiellement differente d'un cas a I'autre. 



Rectifiant, il y a quelques annees une route qui va de Glion au 

 Mont Caux, on attaqua des placages boueux a galets stries et, dans 

 un point, on mit a nu une magnifique surface calcaire moutonnee, 

 polie et striee, offrant tons les caracteres glaciaires, du moins aux 

 yeux de geologues trop prevenus pour voir sainement les faits. Or. 

 on reconnut que cette surface etait seulement la partie superieure 

 d'un enorme bloc de plusieurs metres cubes, noye dans le placage 

 boueux, et Ton voyait tres nettement, dans certains points de ses 

 surfaces laterales et meme de sa surface inferieure, quej'ai pu aise- 

 ment degager en un point, la reproduction exacte du meme poll et 

 de la meme striation. Cette pierre etait done un gigantesque galet 

 pareil aux autres; elle avait ete polie et gtriee ainsi en glissant avec 

 une grande lenteur sur le terrain boueux sous-jacent. 



En outre, dans la region de la surface polie, qui semblait bien 

 "etre en place," on voyait le poll et les stries, meme dans les depres- 

 sions, sans qu'on put trouver nuUe part une de ces zones -preservees 

 du frottement, comme il y en a dans toutes les surfaces glaciaires. 



Une objection qui se presente a I'esprit contre la production des 

 stries par denudation souterraine, c'est la pretendue impermeabilite 

 du terrain argileux a galets polls des Prealpes et des regions analogues. 

 Or, cette impermeabilite est absolument illusoire: dans toute la 

 region des Prealpes que j'ai etudiee, les placages se comportent 

 comme de veritables reservoirs hydrauliques et de leur epaisseur 

 sourdent d'innombrables sources parfois volumineuses. Ces sources, 

 si visibles aupres de Blonnay, de Brent, des Avants, etc., sont essen- 

 tiellement incrustantes. A Blonnay, il faut souvent remplacer, pour

cause d' obstruction travertineuse, les tuyaux de conduite etablis 

 pour capter ces eaux: j'en ai recueilli des echantillons tres demon- 

 stratifs. Aux Avants et entre cette station climaterique et Mon- 

 treux, la tuffiere et d'autres monticules, representent des amas de 

 calcaire concretionne emis par les placages. II y en a un specialement 

 net au lieu dit Sex que pliau (la pierre qui pleut) au-dessus d'En 

 Saumont, non loin de I'Alliaz; des feuilles et des coquilles terrestres 

 y ont laisse des moulages parfaits. 



J'ai pu assister veritablement a la production progressive du poli 

 a la surface des blocs calcaires compris dans les eboulis, en etudiant 

 successivement des escarpemert choisis de plus en plus loin des 

 sommets des Prealpes. Vers Sotodoz (1800 metres)" au pied des 

 Rochers de Naye, les fragments rocheux dont il s'agit sont nettement 

 anguleux et n'ont rien pour attirer I'attention; vers I'altitude du 

 Mont-Caux, les aretes vives et les parties anguleuses sont deja 

 devenues tres rares et les blocs polls sont deja tres nombreux; leur 

 maximum se trouve depuis les Avants jusqu'a Blonnay. Plus bas, 

 la forme du pays cesse d'etre favorable au glissement indispensable 

 a la production qui nous occupe et Ton ne voit aucun galet. 



Je suis arrive a reproduire par I'experience le phenomene de stria- 

 tion souterraine des galets et des surfaces rocheuses par un dispositif 

 tres simple. 



II etait necessaire de modifier les conditions naturelles tout en leur 

 laissant leur caractere essentiel, de fagon a leur faire produire un 

 effet rapide et plus tangible. Pour cela, deux choses s'imposaient: 

 1° recourir a une substance beaucoup plus facile a rayer que le cal- 

 caire, puisque les forces mises en oeuvre allaient etre incomparablement 

 plus faibles que celles qui interviennent dans les phenomenes naturels; 

 - — 2° provoquer dans le sous-sol soumis a la denudation, des mouve- 

 ments plus accentues, afin de provoquer des resultats plus rapides. 

 [Le premier point a conduit a employer des representations des galets 

 en platre moule, parfaitement lisses et polls. Pour cela on remplit 

 de platre gache de consistance tres liquide, de petits ballons de verre, 

 les uns spheriques et les autres ellipsoidaux, c'est-a-dire du modele 

 dit des matras d' essay eur. Une fois le platre bien pris, on brise le 

 verre avec precaution, a moins qu'il ne se brise de lui-meme par 

 dilatation du platre, et on enleve les fragments avec beaucoup de 

 soin pour ne pas produire de rayures. 



Le second point a conduit a adopter comme substance constitutive 

 du sol artificiel, dans la masse duquel la striation devra se faire, un 

 melange, a volumes egaux, de sable quartz eux pas trop fin et de gros 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



sel de cuisine. Soumis a Taction de I'eau, ce melange se reduira a 

 la moitie de son volume et il sera le siege de deplacements intestins 

 favorables a I'effet desire. 



Le melange de sable et de sel est place dans une boite rectangu- 

 laire en bois, et j'ai d'ordinaire employe 10 kilogrammes de sel et 

 le volume correspondant de sable. Pendant le remplissage, qui se 

 fait avec une pelle, on place successivement dans le melange pul- 

 verise, les boules de platre, de fagon a ne point les f rotter et par 

 consequent a ne point rayer leur surface. Quand la caisse est bien 

 pleine, on depose sur le melange une planchette qu'on surcharge d'un 

 poids de 20 a 30 kilogrammes. II n'y a plus qu'a faire arriver au 

 contact de la substance, un filet d'eau qui pent venir soit d'en haut, 

 soit d'en bas, soit lateralement, pour avoir des effets tres varies de 

 tassements, avec glissements en sens divers. Apres la dissolution 

 totale du sel, on arrete I'experience, on laisse egoutter, on ouvre la 

 boite, en empechant tout deplacement de son contenu et, avec les 

 precautions les plus minutieuses, on extrait les boules qui sont 

 lavees avec un jet d'eau et mises a secher. 



On observe alors a leur surface des paquets de stries qui ont avec 

 celles des galets calcaires des placages boueux, les analogies les plus 

 frappantes et les plus instructives. 



C'est ainsi que les stries sont dirigees indifferemment dans tons les 

 sens et le meme spheroide pent en presenter en plusieurs directions. 

 Apres une seule experience, elles sont peu nombreuses, mais on les 

 multiplie aisement en remettant successivement les memes boules 

 de platre dans Tappareil. 



On pent aussi y placer une dalle plane en platre convenablement 

 inclinee et oljtenue par moulage dans une cuvette de porcelaine. 

 Apres I'ecoulement on y voit des stries qui presentent le caractere 

 tres remarquable d'etre frequemment interrompues et parfois a 

 plusieurs reprises, comme le sont de leur cote les stries naturelles. 



La conclusion de ces remarques et de ces experiences a d'autant 

 plus d'importance que le terrain a galets stries, jouit d'une aire de 

 dispersion gigantesque. On le retrouve, pareil a celui des Alpes 

 dans les contreforts de toutes les grandes chaines comme les Pyrenees, 

 les Carpathes, le Caucase, I'Himalaya,^^ les Montagues Rocheuses, 

 etc. M. Roussanoff, membre de la mission de M. le comte Benard,

 stries eux-memes peuvent se trouver dans les pseudo-moraines. Je 

 suis heureux de rappeler ici les titres de priorite de M. Stanislas

 reserver une zone assez large, aussi bien dans les Pyrenees et dans les

NOTES ON THE SEMELID^ OF THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA, INCLUDING 



SOME NEW SPECIES. 



BY WILLIAM H. DALL. 



In revising the Pacific Coast species in the National Collection, 

 considerable confusion was fouird, due in part to the habit of Dr. 

 Carpenter (who originally named the collection) of trusting to the 

 specimens in the collection of Professor C. B. Adams rather than to 

 the diagnoses of that careful author. The specimens in that collec- 

 tion, due to several causes (especially the fact that they were kept 

 loose in trays and not numbered), have in some cases since Professor 

 Adams' death become transposed or mixed, so that, without careful 

 reference to the text, errors of identification were likely to occur. 



Furthermore, the collection of the National Museum since Car- 

 penter's time has been greatly enlarged, and the better and more 

 numerous specimens from a much wider geographical range afford 

 an opportunity for study not available to Dr. Carpenter. 



Semele decisa Conrad, 1837. 



San Pedro to San Diego, California. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This species is also reported from Mazatlan and Tagus Cove, 



Galapagos Islands, but I am not able to confirm these localities. 



Semele solida Gray, 1828. 



Peru and Chile. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This is also doubtfully reported from the Galapagos Islands. It 

 is the crocea of Gould, 1850, and the orbicularis of Hupe, 1854. 



Semele corrugata Sowerby, 1832. 



Not of C. B. Adams, 1852; and probably the californica of A. 

 Adams, 1853. 



Magdalena Bay, Lower California, to Iquique, Peru. (Coll. 

 U. S. N. Mus.) 



It is possibly only a variety of the preceding or the following species. 

 Semele flavescens Gould, 1851. 



Cape St. Lucas to Callao, Peru. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This is the proxima of C. B. Adams, 1852, and the flavicans of 

 Carpenter (1857, lapsus) as of Gould. 

 Semele striosa C. B. Adams, 1852. 



Not of Carpenter, 1857. 



Catalina Island, California, to Panama. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 




26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



This is one of the species which was confused with the following 

 shell by Dr. Carpenter. 

 Semele sparsilineata n. sp. 



Panama, 18 fathoms. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus., No. 96,269.) 



Chile, Hupe. 



This was confused by Hupe with S. variegata Lam., 1818, which 

 it much resembles, but is easily discriminated from the Atlantic 

 species by the much sparser oblique grooving. The best specimen 

 in the National Collection is 15 by 10 mm., with the vertical from 

 the beaks 6.5 mm. behind the anterior end; but the shell grows much 

 larger. 



Semele bicolor C. B. Adams, 1852. 



Gulf of California to Panama. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



A thin orbicular species with distinctive purple suffusion on a 

 white ground. 

 Semele rupicola n. sp. 



This is Semele rupium of California authors following Carpenter; 

 not of Sowerby, 1832. 



Santa Cruz, California, to the Gulf of California. (Coll. U. S. N. 

 Mus.) 



The Galapagos species, for which this has been mistaken, when 

 not distorted by its nestling habit, has a conspicuous furrow radiating 

 from the beak and rostrating the posterior end, and the form of the 

 pallial sinus is different from that of the North American form. 

 The former character is absent in the latter shell, but they are 

 otherwise much alike. 

 Semele rubropicta Dall, 1871. 



Forrester Island, Alaska (Willetts); British Columbia to Tia 

 Juana, Lower California. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



Semele elliptica Sowerby, 1832. 



Not of Carpenter, 1864. 



Central America to Ecuador. (CoU. U. S. N. Mus.) 



Semele junonia Verrill, 1870. 



Carmen Island, Gulf of California. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



Semele jovis A. Adams, 1853. 



Carmen Island, Gulf of California. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



The preceding species and this one appear to be perfectly distinct. 



Semele formosa Sowerby, 1832. 



Gulf of California to Ecuador. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27 



Semele regularis n. sp. 



Gulf of California, off La Paz, in 10 to 30 fathoms. (Coll. U. S. N. 

 Mils., No. 76,433.) 



This is a thin, delicate, usually pure white species of elliptical 

 outline, sculptured with low, obtuse, concentric lamellae, regularlj^ 

 disposed, with fine concentric lineation between them and no trace 

 of radial striation. The beaks are nearly central and the pallial 

 sinus is high, short, subcircular, and hardly extends behind the 

 vertical of the beaks. Some specimens have a faint orange flush 

 internally. The most perfect specimen measures 22 mm. long, 

 17 mm. high, and 6 mm. in diameter. The umbo is about 12 mm. 

 behind the anterior end. Fragments show that the shell grows at 

 least one half larger. 

 Semele pacifica n. sp. 



Catalina Island, California, to Acapulco, Mexico, in 9 to 21 fathoms. 

 (Coll. U. S. N. Mus., No. 211,728.) 



This is the shell usually referred to S. cancellata Sowerby, 1830 

 (S. hellastriata Conrad, 1837), but which differs from that Atlantic 

 species in its smaller lunule, shorter and weaker right lateral tooth, 

 and sharper and more delicate concentric sculpture. It is a rare 

 form and doubtless the two descend from the same Oligocene ances- 

 tors. 

 Semele incongrua Carpenter, 1863. 



Monterey, California, to the Coronado Islands, Lower California. 

 (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This is a well-defined species, and the Pliocene shell named S. 

 pulchra var. montereyi by Arnold, 1903, should be referred to it 

 rather than to pulchra as a variety. 



Semele pulchra Sowerby, 1832. 



Monterey, California, to Ecuador. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 

 Semele venusta A. Adams, 1853. 



Acapulco, Mexico, to West Colombia, South America. (Coll. 

 U. S. N. Mus.) 



The S. ruhrolineata Conrad, 1837, San Diego, California, has not 

 been definitely recognized since it was originally described, and the 

 type is said to be lost. 



It has been, by a lapsus, referred to by Dr. Carpenter as S. ruhro- 

 tincta, and was surmised by him to be a variety of S. pulchra, but 

 the two have no resemblance to each other, judging by Conrad's 

 figure. There does not seem to be any good ground for doubting 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the Chinese origin of S. simplex Adams and Reeve, 1848, to which 

 S. ruhrolineata has also been tentatively referred. 

 Abra pacifica n. sp. 



Guaymas, Mexico. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus., No. 23,700.) 

 Shell small, thin, white, finely concentrically sculptured, giving 

 the surface a silky look; the concentric lines slightly prominent on 

 the dorsal part of the posterior end; beaks not prominent, slightly 

 anterior, outline elongate, attenuated and pointed behind, rounded 

 in front; with only faint traces of microscopic radial strise or none; 

 hinge normal, right cardinal tooth bifid, anterior right lateral stout, 

 very short, posterior feeble, longer; left valve with a bifid cardinal 

 and no laterals; pallial sinus obscure. Length 9, height 5.5, diameter 

 3.0 mm. 



This is the first species of the genus reported from the Pacific 

 Coast. It was collected by Dr. Edward Palmer. 

 Abra tepocana n. sp. 



Off Cape Tepoca, Lower California, in 14 fathoms. (U. S. N. Mus., 

 No. 108,552.) 



Shell small, white, equivalve, anterior end longer; surface with 

 a dull silky lustre due to extremely minute concentric striation; 

 beaks rather prominent; dorsal margins descending, anterior end 

 rounded evenly into a gently arcuate base, posterior end narrower, 

 blunt, hardly truncate, slightly bent to the right as in a Macoma; 

 right valve with a conspicuous resilifer, a very small cardinal tooth 

 and the laterals obsolete; left valve with the cardinal hardly per- 

 ceptible and no lateral laminae; pallial sinus large, 5.6 mm. deep, 

 rounded in front. Length 8, height 6, diameter 3.5 mm., the 

 beaks behind the anterior end 5 mm. 



Abra palmeri n. sp. 



Ballenas Lagoon on the west coast of Lower California; the 

 Gulf of California (Dr. E. Palmer) ; and Panama Baj^ in 26 fathoms 

 (U. S. N. Mus.). Type locality, Panama Bay. (U. S. N. Mus., 

 No. 96,301.) 



Shell short, high, inflated, white, with a silky surface, and a very 

 thin, polished, pale yellow periostracum ; anterior end and base 

 rounded; beaks subcentral, dorsal margins descending, posterior 

 end attenuated and with the extremity rounded; right valve with a 

 deeply bifid (or double) cardinal tooth, the laterals obsolete; left 

 valve with a single cardinal and no laterals. Length 10, height 8, 

 diameter 5.5 mm. The pallial sinus rounded, 6 mm. deep. 



This species is nearest to A. lioica Dall, of the Atlantic Coast of 

 the United States.

NOTES ON THE WATER SNAKE NATRIX COMPRESSICAUDA. 

 BY T. BARBOUR AND G. K. NOBLE. 



Natrix compressicauda} and its four hitherto described subspecies are 

 confined wholly to Florida, where they inhabit the brackish lagoons 

 and estuaries of the sea. Since specimens of this water snake are rare 

 in collections, the systematic relationships of the several forms have 

 not been thoroughly determined and any data on this subject should 

 be of interest. Having examined some fifteen adults and a brood 

 of fifteen young from the collection of the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoology, we have found a remarkable variability in individuals 

 from the same locality, while those from different localities have not 

 shown any peculiar characters correlated with their distribution. 

 The young from one brood are dichromatic and show many of the 

 same variations as the adults, and seem to make it certain that 

 there is but a single variable form to be recognized. 



Mr. A. G. Reynolds, of Gulf port, Fla., who has collected a large 

 proportion of the known specimens of Natrix compressicauda, is 

 familiar with this variability of color in fresh specimens. In a letter 

 of September 23, 1914, he writes: 



"I have never found it anywhere except in brackish or salt water. 

 Its local name is the 'salt-water moccasin.' The fishermen occa- 

 sionally find it plentiful among the keys, but they never get me any 

 specimens, although I offer a good price for them. It seems to be 

 more or less plentiful at Key West. Here we get a straw-colored 

 variety, also a variety with one row of spots beneath, and a variety 

 with three rows of spots beneath." 



With the exception of one specimen, the entire series in our col- 

 lection was taken by Mr. A. G. Reynolds. All but one of these 

 have been taken within the last few years and come from different 

 parts of the region of Tampa Bay and Key West. One of the 

 Tampa Bay specimens, kindly loaned for examination by the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, comes from Tarpon Springs 

 and was collected by S. N. Rhodes, in 1896. The others from this 

 region were taken at St. Petersburg by Mr. Reynolds. 



1 Kennicott, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 335. 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan.,. 



Of the Key West specimens there is one (M. C. Z. 2,444) worthy 

 of special note. Cope^ says in speaking of .V. c. compsolcema: 



"The only known specimen of this subspecies was found at Key 

 West, Florida, and is preserved in the Aluseum of Comparative 

 Zoology, Cambridge, Mass." 



The specimen to which Cope refers cannot now be found in the 

 museum. The only example which might be mistaken for it is 

 No. 2,444. But this specimen came with another (M. C. Z. 2,446) 

 of the same species, which also seems to have disappeared. Both 

 were said to have been collected in the Florida Keys and probably 

 at Key West by L. F. de Pourtales. They were given by him to the 

 museum and were entered in the register by S. Garman in 1874. 



That No. 2,444 cannot possibly have served Cope as the type of 

 his N. c. compsolcema is shown by several noteworthy discrepancies. 

 The tail and body lengths of the specimen (No. 2,444) are each some 

 hundred millimeters longer than was Cope's type, and the dorsal 

 rows are 21 as against the 19 given by Cope. Furthermore, the 

 head shield characters of the two specimens are not the same. 



Cope's type was probably not returned by him to the museum, 

 and wide inquiry elsewhere has failed to locate it. Unfortunately, 

 this is not the only specimen which suffered this fate. 



The Described Forms. 



Cope^ sums up the characters of the several races in respect to 

 color as follows: 



"N. c. compressicauda (Kennicott) : numerous dark cross bands, 

 which are resolved into three rows of spots just anterior to the tail, 

 and four longitudinal stripes on the neck. 



"N. c. tceniata Cope:^ four series of longitudinal spots above, those 

 of the median pair forming two longitudinal stripes on the greater 

 part of the length; the laterals forming stripes on the neck only. 



"iV. c. walkeri (Yarrow):^ yellowish with narrow brown bands, no 

 postocular l^and. 



'W. c. obscura Lonnberg:^ sooty above with transverse bands an- 

 teriorly. 



"iV. c. compsolcema (Cope):^ above blackish brown with numerous 

 closely placed cross bands."

N. c. ohscura 21 (?)

The head shield characters of N. c. tceniata and A'', c. walkeri are 

 not treated very fully by Cope or Yarrow, while for N. c. ohscura no 

 scutation is given at all. Because the data given by Cope are 

 incomplete, only the following can be expressed: 



Pre- and 

 Labials. postoculars. Temporals. 



N. c. compressicauda 8+10 1+3 1+3 



.V. c. taniata 8+10 1+3 1+3

.V. c. ohscura Not given. 



N. c. compsolcema 8+ 9 1+3 ? 



Again, the length of the tail in percentage to total length taken 

 from Cope would be: 



N. c. compressicauda 28.8% 



N. c. tceniata 25.9% 



N. c. walkeri ? 



N. c. ohscura ? 



N. c. compsolcema 21.5% 



Lastly, a glance shows that the type locality of these "races" are 

 all in the same faunal area. Two of the races came originally from 

 Tampa Bay and two from Key West, while the remaining one was 

 from the opposite side of Florida, taken at Volusia. 



The Adult Specimens. 



Trying to classify the fifteen adults under the five described races, 

 we find that none conform in every detail to any one race, but that 

 each one presents some of the characters from more than one ''sub- 

 species." Eight of these adults are from Tampa Bay, the other 

 seven from Key West. 



The coloration of the adults shows a gradual change dorsally from 

 the dark brown to the light straw-colored phases and from the wide 




32 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



to the narrow-banded conditions; ventrally from the two-lined form 

 to one .with a single row of spots anteriorly. The longitudinal 

 stripes on the neck and the oblique body stripes typical of N. c. 

 compressicauda are well defined on two specimens before us from 

 St. Petersburg. There is another specimen from the same region 

 which approaches N. c. loalkeri in characteristic ground tone and 

 markings, but the dorsal surface is darker and there is a vestige of 

 the neck stripes found in A'', c. compressicauda and N. c. tceniata. 

 One Key West specimen follows the description of A'', c. compsolcema 

 almost exactly, while four others from Key West form distinct steps 

 toward the typical walkeri pattern and coloration. Eliminating 

 the three specimens from St. Petersburg, Tampa Bay, and the one 

 from Key West which have a uniform straw-color and leaving out 

 the one specimen from Key West that approaches N. c. ohscura and 

 which may be considered as melanistic, we have ten specimens 

 remaining which seem to show a gradual change in pattern and color 

 from N. c. compressicauda, through N. c. tceniata, N. c. compsolcema, 

 to N. c. walkeri. Throughout this series no one character is dis- 

 tinctive enough to separate a race, although the Key West specimens 

 all show a darker ventral surface. The straw-colored form is uniform 

 and therefore has no distinguishing color characters, but the sooty 

 variety approaching N. c. ohscura seems to be a melanistic form of 

 N. c. compsolcema, since its spots and faint bars have that arrangement. 

 The scale rows of the adult specimens present as pronounced a 

 variation: there is no correlation between the color patterns and 

 the number of scales and the counts given by Cope cannot be taken 

 as differential characters of separate races. Two of the specimens 

 before us have twenty-three dorsal rows, yet one has a color pattern 

 typical of N. c. compressicauda while the other approaches N. c. 

 walkeri. The range of the scale counts of the Tampa Bay specimens 



is expressed by the formula: 



„„126-135 



"^^ ^^ 68-83 ' 

 and the average is : 



The Key West specimens, on the other hand, have the range of 



128-134 



72-82 

 and the average of 



13L2 



77.7 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 33 



It is noteworthy that the sooty specimen Hke N. c. ohscura in 



134 



color has a very high scale count, it being 21 -, but since several 



other counts are nearly as large no significance can be placed on this. 

 As only two of the fifteen specimens are females, and since these 

 have average body scale counts, no sex differentiation is sho\vn. 



In the relative length of the body and tail the adult specimens 

 vary greatly from the described forms. For example, the one 

 specimen which follows so closely the description of the color of 

 N. c. compsolcema, and which also came from Key West, has for its 

 body-tail proportions 27.1%; Cope, on the other hand, gives meas- 

 urements of 21.5%. The Tampa Bay specimens check up lower in 

 average than the Key West ones. The range for the former being 

 22.6%-25.4%, average 24.1%, while the latter is 24.8-28.2%, average 

 26.1%. Since there is an overlapping of the high numbers of the 

 former and the low ones of the latter and since the range of the 

 whole series is not very great, races cannot be separated. 



In the same way, the head scutation of the adults show great 

 variation. For example, two of the male specimens from Key West 

 {A and B) have a color pattern very similar to iV. c. walkeri, their 

 dorsal rows are both twenty-one, yet they differ considerably as 

 shown below. Another specimen (C) from St. Petersburg is very 

 similar to N. c. compressicauda in color pattern, it has twenty-three 

 dorsal rows, yet its head characters are like those of (B) .

In regard to the geographical distribution of these "forms," we 



have already spoken of their limited range. Although the museum 



has a series from Tampa Bay and Key West, no topotype of N. c. 



tceniata is at hand Nevertheless, some of the specimens before us 



from Tampa Bay and Key West show most of the characters of this 



supposed race. 



The Brood of Young. 



The variability in color characters of the adults finds correlation 

 in a brood of fifteen young born from a specimen similar to the 

 typical N. c. compressicauda. The mother was taken alive by 

 Mr. A. G. Reynolds and the young were born in captivity. They 

 are distinctly dichromatic; one group, ten in number, being like the 

 adult but with generally lighter ground color — in other words, 

 approaching N. c. walkeri — while the others, five in number, are 

 uniformly straw-color, as seen in some of the other adults. The 

 olilique dorsal bands of the young vary somewhat in width, but 

 there is not as much variation as we see in the adults. In fact, the 

 young of this brood present in color only two or possibly three of 

 the phases which are seen in the older individuals. 



In comparing the scutation of the young water snakes, on the 

 other hand, we find a great variability of the head shields and the 

 body scale counts. The dorsal rows have a constant number, 

 twenty-one, the same as the mother. The range of the ventral- 

 subcaudal scale count is: 



126 132 129.06 



^ - -82"' ^^^^^S" "74:2- 



Since six of this brood are females and four of these six have low 

 counts while two have high ones, no general statement can be made 

 on sex differentiation. Turning to the head shields, we find almost 

 as much variation as in the adults. The range of these characters 

 in the brood is:

Regarding the relative length of body and tail, we would expect 

 the proportion to run rather low since the brood comes from Tampa 

 Bay. But this is not the case. The range is 2o.5%-27.8%, average 

 27.1%. 



From this it may be seen that but one race of Natrix compressi- 

 cauda can be recognized.

ON CERTAIN VESICLES FOUND IN THE INTEGUMENT OF ANTS. 



BY ADELE M. FIELDE. 



During the years 1900 to 1907, I demonstrated by ex^periments, 

 duly set forth in print, that the antennae of the ant are a pair of 

 compound noses, certain segments having eadh a special function. 

 The ants in my formicaries were subject to observation by day and 

 by night, all the year round. The experiments were unhurried, 

 very numerous, and with adequate material for every series. No 

 ant that had not manifestly recovered normal health after the 



required surgical operation was 

 engaged in the service demanded 

 by an experiment. (See b, page 

 425, and j, page 215.)^ 



I found that the habitual activi- 

 ties of the ants are guided mainly 

 by diverse odors, produced by the 

 ants themselves, and discerned 

 through the sub-noses of the olfac- 

 tory organs, the funicles of the 

 antennae. 



These odors are: (1) the odor of 

 the domicile, the nest aura, made 

 up of the commingled odors of the 

 inhabitants, and discerned through 

 the air by the distal segment of the 

 antenna. The normal ant, warned 

 by an alien aura, fears and avoids 

 the habitation of any ant com- 

 munity other than her own, and 

 she strives to flee or hide when 

 forcibly introduced into the alarm- 

 ing atmosphere of an unknown 

 nest. But if the twelfth, the distal segment, is eliminated, the ant 

 no longer distinguishes the domiciliary odor and stays fearlessly in 



See bibliography at conclusion of paper. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 37 



the abode of her enemies until her life pays the penalty of her uncon- 

 scious temerity. This sub-nose appears to discern many odors, 

 diffused in the air. (See c, page 539.) 



(2) It is well known that ants of the same species abide in different 

 colonies or communities so hostile to one another that an encounter 

 between members of different colonies results in a battle, often 

 prolonged until one or the other is exterminated. The undeveloped 

 young of one colony are sometimes stolen and reared by the adults 

 of another colony of the same species, but the adults of different 

 colonies ordinarily maintain a mutual repugnance that is invincible, 

 no matter how long an artificially enforced companionship may 

 exist. The colony odor, depending on age, is discerned through 

 the penultimate segment of the antenna. When this segment is 

 elmiinated, ants of different colonies of the same species live and 

 work together in complete accord. They are then unaware of the 

 objectionable odor of their comrades, as they no longer perceive 

 what the normal ant discerns. The colony odor is discerned through 

 contact of the antenna with the body of the ant subject to examina- 

 tion. This eleventh segment is, or contains, an organ of chemical 

 sense which might be called olfactory or gustatory. (See b, page 

 449; c, page 531; d, page 609; t, page 1.) 



(3) When an ant goes out from her dwelling, she lays down from 

 her feet an odorous substance whereby she is guided on her return 

 journey. She discerns her own scent through the antepenultimate 

 segment of the antenna, and through the air. When this tenth 

 segment is eliminated she is no longer able to retrace her steps and 

 is completely bewildered. She is as incapable as is a dog in pursuit 

 of a master who has waded. (See c, page 522.) But in her case 

 the track remains, while power to pick up the scent has been de- 

 stroyed in the pursuer. 



(4) The next two segments of the funicle, the eighth and ninth 

 counted from the proximal end of the antenna of Stenamma fulvum 

 piceum, discern the odor of the queen and of the undeveloped young 

 ordinarily her progeny. When these segments are eliminated, the 

 worker ant, that in her normal condition evinced extreme devotion 

 to the welfare of the inactive young and to the queen-mother, becomes 

 wholly indifferent to all or any of those whom she has heretofore 

 served. There are indications that the inactive young, as well as 

 the queen, have a progressive odor, appreciable to the workers both 

 by contact and in the air, and that the odor is a distinctive one, 

 alluring to the workers. (See c, page 542; k, page 229.) 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



(5) The next two segments, the sixth and seventh from the proxi- 

 mal end of the antenna, discern the odor of ants of alien species, 

 always regarded and treated as enemies unless acquaintance has 

 been made in the earliest days of the individual ant's existence. 

 Prolonged warfare and terrible slaughter often occur between ant 

 colonies of different species. But if the sixth and seventh segments 

 of the antennae be eliminated, ants of different species or even of 

 different sub-families will live together amicably and will regurgitate 

 food to one another. I have had representatives of so mam- as 

 five different genera living in close fellowship in the same nest. 

 The specific odor is discerned by contact, the antenna being applied 

 to some part of the body of the ant encountered. (See h, page 321; 

 k, page 229.) 



The two antennae of the ant are identical in function, either one 

 serving the purposes of both. Among the three or four thousand 

 species of known ants the number of segments in the antennae varies 

 from four to thirteen. In my work of ascertaining the function of 

 the antennal segments, I used mainly Stenamma fulvum piceiim, a 

 Myrmicine ant, having twelve segments in the antennae. It is not 

 improbable that further investigation, equally painstaking, would 

 reveal olfactory functions in other segments than those tested by 

 me. It is certain, however, that segments proximal to the sixth 

 do not discern the odors appreciated by the seven at the distal end. 



Since the ants have given evidence that they bear in their bodies 

 several different odors, they must have glands producing unlike 

 odors. The nest aura requires no separate apparatus, because its 

 creation is effected by the combined odors of the inhabitants of the 

 nest. The colony odor, inherited from the queen and changing with 

 age of the ants, demands a means of production that might well be 

 inquired for along the sides of the thorax where the ants so commonly 

 apply a caressing antenna. The scent that is laid down on the 

 track would probably issue from the feet or legs, while the odor of 

 the queen would be produced in some gland that would be no more 

 than rudimentary in the workers. The diverse specific odors are 

 easily discernible by human nostrils; and even an ant may be tem- 

 porarily deceived by an individual of the enemy's troop painted 

 with the blood of a friend. There must be glands for producing 

 this odor. • 



Many observers have described certain vesicles in the integument 

 of ants, as well as of many other insects, since Hicks first studied 

 them. (1857 to 1860.) Janet, whose work on the anatomy of the 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



ant has been long continued, highly skilled and very prolific, shows 

 these organs as a pit communicating with the external air by means 

 of a pore. They have been variously named. I suggest to myrme- 

 oologists the possibility that these vesicles found in groups or scattered 

 over the body and limbs of the ant may be the producers of the 

 odors borne by the insect, and I urge research among Forel's "inverted 

 flasks," the "pits and pegs," the "plates and pores," and all 

 papillae on the ant. 



Dr. N. E. Mclndoo, of the Bureau of Entomology at Washing-ton, 

 D. C, has issued two papers, one in April, 1914, The Olfactory Sense 

 of the Honeij Bee, and one in November, 1914, The Olfactory Sense of 

 Insects. I venture a few brief comments thereupon. 



Dr. Mclndoo quotes Dr. W. M. Wheeler's objection to my dis- 

 covery that "the olfactory organs of an animal may exhibit 'regional 

 differentiations.'" This objection, unsupported as it is by physio- 

 logical tests applied to the ant, should influence no investigator. 

 If there be error in the process of experimentation or flaw in the logic 

 of the deduction, the critic should indicate the point of departure 

 from a correct course. It is true that my statements are "unsup- 

 ported by other observers," but lack of support by other observers 

 is a misfortune that necessarily befalls the research worker who 

 makes the earliest observation. 



Dr. Mclndoo's iterated statement that his bees were "abnormal," 

 without definite indication of the cause or kind of abnormality, 

 gives no assistance in the formation of a sound judgment concerning 

 the changes due to mutilation. " Almormality " of some sort is a 

 natural consequent of mutilation. The question is whether a 

 certain abnormal condition invariably ensues from a particular 

 mutilation. 



In those cases where Dr. Mclndoo's surgical operations upon 

 his bees were performed by the pulling apart or the burning off of 

 segments, the lesions produced in the adjacent tissues must have 

 been such as to seriously affect the functions of the parts subject 

 to subsequent observation. 



The odors of the essential oils used in his experiments must have 

 been diffused through the air, and the reaction of the bees, normal 

 or abnormal, may in many cases have been due to the effect of the 

 odorous particles upon the trachea through the spiracles rather than 

 to their appeal to the sense of smell. 



Dr. Mclndoo's experiments and observations appear to me to be 

 confirmatory rather than contradictory of the view of most ento- 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



mologists that the antennse are the organs of smell in insects. The 

 evidence he sets forth is far from being convincing of the truth of 

 his final asseveration that "the antennse can no longer be regarded 

 as the seat of the sense of smell in insects"; and equally remote from 

 acceptance should be his conclusion that the organs he chooses to 

 call "olfactory pores" "are the true olfactory apparatus in 

 Hymenoptera. "

One hundred persons ijresent. 



The deaths of George J. Scattergood, July 16, 1914, and of 

 Benjamin Sharp, M.D., January 23, 1915, members, were announced. 



On the announcement of the death of Dr. Sharp, the following 

 was read by the Recording Secretary and ordered to be placed on 

 the minutes: 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia desires 

 to place on record its sense of the loss sustained by the society and 

 by the scientific world in the death of Dr. Benjamin Sharp, on 

 January 23. 



Dr. Sharp graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsyl- 

 vania in 1879. He subsequently studied in the Universities of 

 Berlin, Leipzig, and Wurzburg. Immediately after securing his degree 

 of Doctor of Philosophy from the last named institution in 1883 he 

 published his first paper in the Proceedings of the Academy, a reprint 

 of his graduation thesis on the anatomy of Ancylus. He subse- 

 quently i:)ublished twenty communications as contributions to the 

 Proceedings. They cover a wide range of subjects, but are most 

 important, perhaps, as studies of the visual organs of mollusks. 



Dr. Sharp was elected Corresponding Secretary of the Academy 

 in 1890 and served efficiently until 1902. 



His work as an attache of the United States Fish Commission, 

 as zoologist of the first Peary Arctic Expedition, and as professor 

 in the Academy, the University of Pennsylvania, and in the Central 

 High School, together with his explorations of Behring Sea, the West 

 Indies, and the Sandwich Islands, was all prosecuted in direct asso- 

 ciation with the Academy, to which he was always most generous 

 in the expression of his obligation for encouragement and assistance. 



Dr. Sharp was endowed with a retentive memory and the faculty 

 of clear and accurate statement. He was a man of singular personal 

 charm and of an unusual range of sympathy and accomplishment. 

 A strikingly attractive figure anywhere, he was equally at home in 

 a scientific meeting, a drawing-room, or on the dock with his chums, 

 the fishermen. He retained to the last the qualities of an eager, 

 ingenuous boy without any of the disadvantages of immaturity. 



Although not intimately associated with the Academy since 

 1902, his periodical visits sustained his affectionate relations with 

 his fellow-members and testified to his loyalty to the institution. 



The realization of its own loss in the death of Dr. Sharp 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



enables the Academy to appreciate the bereavement of his wife and 

 children, to whom is extended its heartfelt sympathy. 



Mr. Robert Cushman Murphy spoke on bird-life at an outpost 

 of the Antarctic. The communication was beautifully illustrated 

 by lantern views. 



The Secretary read the following communication from Miss 

 Adele M. Fielde, of Seattle, Washington: 



Concerning the Sense of Smell in Dogs. — In the winter of 1911-12, 

 I spent over four consecutive months in the city of Tucson, Arizona, 

 lodging in one house and taking my meals in another, a quarter of 

 a mile distant. The street, In the residential section of the city, 

 traversed by me several times daily, was wide, with paved walk on 

 both sides, in front of detached houses whose owners generally 

 cherished watch dogs. In my earliest journeys along the sidewalks, 

 the dogs, of various breeds, in their respective, shrubby dooryards, 

 all barked at me, so intentionally as to make me doubt whether 

 existence would be tolerable under such local conditions. 



I persisted, however, in my course as a pedestrian, made no 

 acquaintance with the o\\Tiers of the dogs, no calls at their residences, 

 and no efforts at conciliation of the animals. Nevertheless, the 

 barking of the clogs gradually subsided and then ceased, first on the 

 west side of the street that I traversed most frequently, and later 

 upon the east side of the street, where I walked but seldom. Some 

 weeks before I left Tucson, all the dogs had stopped barking at me 

 during my passage alongside their grounds, whether by day or by 

 night. In the evenings I usually carried a lantern whose light fell 

 upon the pavement without illuminating me. 



A small dog, resident in the house where I lodged, maintained 

 hostilities toward me for several days after my arrival, but changed 

 his mental attitude toward me with no conciliation on my part, and 

 then habitually gave immoderate expression to his delight whenever 

 I returned to the house. 



Such change in the behavior of these clogs indicates that at my 

 earliest coming they perceived an unknown scent either upon the 

 pavement or in the air and resented its intrusion among countless 

 familiar odors. When accustomed to the intruded scent, having 

 received no injury from its bearer, they ceased from audible protest 

 against her presence. Without contact at any time, and with 

 darkness and distance often such as to make vision improbable, the 

 cause of the behavior of the dogs appears to lie in their sense of 

 smell. That they could pick up the scent laid down on the pave- 

 ment was to be expected of them. That they recognized its depositor 

 in the dark and at a distance of many yards, and refrained from 

 any vocal exercise save a monosyllabic assertion of being on duty,, 

 indicates high olfactory sensitivity.

Introduction. 



The present study was undertaken at the suggestion of Prof. Goto^ 

 of the Imperial University of Tokyo; and to him my hearty thanks 

 are due for supervision and the revision of part of the manuscript. 



My first purpose was merely to identify and name species. But 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



I soon found that the classifications of the Ophiuroidea hitherto pro- 

 posed were very unsatisfactory. Indeed, their imperfectness became 

 a haunt to me; so I determined to devise a new classification of 

 my own. 



For this purpose, I have dissected representatives of as many 

 genera as were accessible; and the following are some of the more 

 important results obtained: 



A. Morphological. — Those forms that have arms, capable of 

 being vertically coiled, have a very compact oral skeleton (the 

 adoral shields are entirely proximal to the oral shield, being firmly 

 united to it; the oral frames are very stout, those of the same radius 

 being firmly joined together; the peristomal plates are entire and 

 more or less soldered to the oral frames, etc.), and very short, stout 

 vertebrae, of which the articulation is streptospondyline, with a 

 very rudimentary, or no articular peg. More or less divided ver- 

 tebrae are found only in certain genera with horizontally flexible 

 arms; such vertebrae are of two kinds, those which are divided into 

 halves by a single fusiform pore (found in forms in which the dorsal 

 side of the arms is more or less unprotected) and those in which the 

 two halves are separated by a series of small pores (found in forms 

 with the dorsal side of the arms entirely protected). Forms with 

 •quadrangular and stout teeth have oral frames with well-developed 

 lateral wings for the attachment of voluminous masticatory mus- 

 cles, etc. 



B. Systematic. — Astroceras, Trichaster and Euryala have a certain 

 common structure, by which they may be distinguished from either 

 Aster onyx or Asteroschema; Astrotoma and its allies have certain 

 distinctive characters in contrast to Asteroporpa, Astrochele, Gor- 

 gonocephalus, Astrocladus and their aUies; the Amphiuridae (emend.) 

 and the Ophiotrichidae are intimately related by their internal struc- 

 ture; ^'Ophiactis" pars, i.e., my Amphiactis, is a connecting link 

 between the Ophiacanthidae and Amphiuridae; the Ophiolepididae, 

 Ophiodermatidae and Ophiocomidae form together another compact 

 group; my Ophiochitonidae are not referable to Amphiuridae (emend.) 

 but are very near the Ophiodermatidae and Ophiocomidae; Ophiopsila 

 is, as a matter of fact, a near ally of the Ophiocomidae; "Ophioconis" 

 pars, i.e., my Ophiuroconis and Ophiurodon, and "Ophiochceta" 

 pars, i.e., my Ophiurochata, are perfectly distinguishable from 

 Ophiolimna (emend.), by their internal structure, etc. 



Prefixing so much, I now proceed to the. exposition of my views, 

 leaving them to be judged on their merits. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45- 



During the present study, I have received great help from Dr. 

 Hubert Lyman Clark, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, in. 

 the loan of many precisely determined specimens from that Museum 

 and in helpful advice; my best thanks are due to him. This paper 

 is in fact an outcome of his suggestions. A more detailed monograph 

 with illustrations will be published ultimately in Japan. 



The outbreak of the present war has made it impossible for me to- 

 receive some specimens of Palaeozoic ophiurans promised me by 

 Dr. B. Sttirtz, so that I am obliged to defer a revision and classifica- 

 tion of Palaeozoic ophiurans to the future. 



The greater part of the present study was done in the Zoological 

 Institute of the Imperial University of Tokyo, and the type speci- 

 mens of all the new species described belong to it. 



Sendai, Japan, December 1, 1914. 



Subclass I. CEGOPHIUROIDA nov. 



Ophiuroidea with external ambulacral grooves, and without 

 ventral arm plates. Radial shields, genital plates and scales, oral 

 shields and dorsal arm plates also absent. Ambulacral plates 

 alternate or opposite; in the latter case, they may often be soldered 

 in pairs to form the vertebrae. Adambulacral plates, i.e., lateral 

 arm plates, subventral. Madreporite either dorsal or ventral, 

 often large and similar in shape to that of an Asteroid. 



This subclass consists chiefly of Palaeozoic genera. 



The CEgophiuroida lack all the fundamental characters by which 

 Recent ophiurans are clearly distinguished from Asteroids. Indeed, 

 the distinction of the present subclass from the cryptozonial Aster- 

 oids depends merely upon the different development of certain, 

 common structures. 



Subclass II. MYOPHIUROIDA nov. 



Ophiuroidea without external ambulacral grooves, and with 

 ventral arm plates. Radial shields, genital plates and scales, oral 

 shields and dorsal arm plates usually present; but sometimes rudi- 

 mentary or absent. Ambulacral plates opposite, usually completely 

 soldered in pairs to form the vertebrae. Madreporite represented 

 by one, or sometimes all, of the oral shields. 



This subclass includes certain Palaeozoic forms and all the ophiurans 

 since the Mesozoic.

 Peristomal plates large, entire, or sometimes double or triple. Oral 

 frames entire, without well-cleveloped lateral wings. Dorsal arm 

 plates absent or very rudimentary; lateral arm plates ventral or 

 sub ventral in position; dorsal side of arms largely unprotected.

Key to subfamilies of Ophiomyxidce. 



A — Oral shields separated from first lateral arm plates by outer 

 lobes of the adoral shields; peristomal plates usually double 

 or triple, not very thick, not firmly fixed to the oral frames, 

 which are rather slender; vertebrae long and slender, except 

 one or two basal ones which are discoidal, distal ones usually 

 divided into halves; wings of vertebrae not equally thick, 

 but distinctly much thinner laterally than dorsally; vertebral 

 articulation zygospondyline, the articular peg being well 

 developed Ophiomyxin^e.

 ones discoidal, none divided into halves; wings of vertebrae 

 almost equally thick laterally and dorsally; vertebral articu-

 or absent OPHiOBYRSiNiB. 



Subfamily 1. OPHIOMYXIN^ Ljungman, 1871 (emend.). 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiohelus, Ophiosciasma, Ophiogeron, 

 Astrogeron, Ophiocynodus, Ophiostyracium, Ophiosyzygiis, Ophio- 

 leptoplax, Ophioscolex, Neoplax, Opkiomora, Ophiomyxa, Ophiodera, 

 Ophiohymen, and provisionally Ophiamhix, besides two new genera, 

 Ophiostiha and Ophiohyalus. 



OPHIOSTIBA gen. nov. 



Disk covered by a skin containing a number of scattered granules. 

 Radial shields very rudimentary, forming a continuous row with 

 the marginal disk scales, which are well developed, as in Ophiomyxa, 

 Ophiomora and Neoplax. Teeth and oral papillae present, with acute 

 ends. Arms skin-covered; dorsal arm plates absent, while the 

 lateral arm plates are subventral, so that the dorsal side of the arms 

 is largely naked. Distal vertebrae more or less divided into halves 

 by a longitudinally fusiform pore. Arm spines few, all converted 

 into compound hooks. Tentacle scales absent. 



This new genus differs from Ophioscolex chiefly in the presence of 

 the marginal disk scales and in the conversion of the arm spines 

 into compound hooks; and from Neoplax in the fewer arm spines, 

 which are converted into compound hooks, and in the absence of 

 tentacle scales. 

 Ophiostiba hidekiii sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 3.5 mm. Length of arms 16 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 0.8 mm. Disk hexagonal, with concave interradial 

 borders, covered by a soft skin, which contains a number of scattered 

 granules. Radial shields very rudimentary and insignificant, 

 forming a continuous row with the marginal disk scales, which are 

 well developed. Genital slits very small and short. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, with perfectly rounded outer and lateral 

 angles, convex, slightly longer than wide; each serving as a madre-

porite. Adoral shields long and narrow, but with widened outer 

 ends, meeting each other within. Four or five oral papillae on 

 either side, triangular, with acute apices. Teeth stout, triangular, 

 acute. 



Six arms, of which three are longer than the other three, as an 

 indication of schizogony. Dorsal arm plates entirely absent; dorsal 

 side of vertebrae clearly visible. Lateral arm plates low, meeting 

 below. First ventral arm plates very small, rhomboidal, longer 

 than wide; the following heptagonal, with strongly concave proximo- 

 lateral and outer sides (the former adjoining the tentacle pores), 

 much longer than wide, widest opposite the outer ends of the tentacle 

 pores; calcification very feeble along median line, the plates appear- 

 ing as if longitudinally grooved. In the outer half of the arm, the 

 vertebrse are more or less divided into halves by fusiform pores. 

 Two or three hyaline arm spines, converted into compound hooks, 

 with four or five denticles along the abradial side; the lowest one is 

 slightly shorter than the upper ones, which are about two-thirds as 

 long as the corresponding arm joint. The uppermost spines of 

 either side of successive arm joints are connected by a hyaline, 

 web-like membrane, except on the basal and most distal joints. 

 Tentacle pores large, without any scale. Color in alcohol: disk 

 deep chocolate-brown, except the granules, which are white; arms 

 brownish yellow. 



Two specimens; Sagami Sea; 300 fathoms. 



This new species evidently reproduces by schizogony, as indicated 

 by the hetaractiny and the occurrence of six madreporites. 



OPHIOHYALUS gen. nov. 



Disk covered by a skin, with marginal scales. Radial shields 

 very rudimentary, forming a continuous row with the marginal 

 disk scales. Teeth and oral papillae flattened and serrate, like 

 those of Ophiomyxa, Ophiodera and Ophiohymen. Dorsal arm plates 

 present, but rudimentary, entire, thin, hyaline, separated from each 

 other by naked spaces. Vertebrae more or less divided into halves. 

 Arm spines few, converted into compound hooks. Tentacle scales 

 absent. 



This new genus is near Ophiomyxa, but differs from it in the rudi- 

 mentary radial shields, the divided vertebrae, the entire rudimentary 

 dorsal arm plates and the conversion of the arm spines into com- 

 pound hooks. In almost all characters, Ophiohyalus is more embry- 

 onal than Ophiomyxa. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 49 



Ophiohyalus gotoi sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 9 mm. Length of arms 28 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1 mm. Disk pentagonal, with concave interradial 

 borders, very fiat, covered by a thin skin. Marginal disk scales 

 present, feeble. Radial shields rudimentary and insignificant, 

 forming a continuous row with the marginal disk scales. Genital 

 slits small and short, extending from outer end of adoral shield to 

 that of second lateral arm plate. 



Oral shields triangular, with perfectly rounded lateral angles, 

 outer side slightly concave; two and a half times as wide as long. 

 Adoral shields large, triangular, very long, acutely tapered inwards, 

 but not meeting. Oral plates long and narrow. The space encircled 

 by the oral and adoral shields and oral plates is strongly depressed. 

 Three or four oral papillse on either side, thin, hyaline, serrate along 

 the free edge. Two or three short, wide, flattened teeth, with 

 rounded and finely serrate ends. Deep in the oral slit on either side 

 of each jaw there occurs one conical, rough papilla, which protects 

 the first oral tentacle pore. 



Arms slender, covered by a very thin, transparent skin. Dorsal 

 arm plates small, oval, thin, hyaline, longer than wide, wider within 

 than without, separated from each other by naked spaces; the}^ lie 

 over the distal parts of the vertebrae of the corresponding arm joints, 

 and become very small and delicate towards the extremity of the 

 arm. Lateral arm plates low, slightly flaring, successive plates not 

 in contact with each other, but separated by a naked space, which 

 is widened upwards and continued into a large naked space bounded 

 by the dorsal and lateral arm plates and the vertebra. First ventral 

 arm plate not very small, quadrangular, with strongly curved outer 

 side, much wider without than within; those beyond nearly rhom- 

 boidal in outline, with a conspicuous reentrant notch at outer end 

 and a half pore for the tentacle at each lateral angle; much longer 

 than wide, widest opposite outer ends of tentacle pores; successive 

 plates not in contact with each other, except within the disk. The 

 lateral arm plates do not, however, meet each other in the ventral 

 median line, so that there is left here a naked, depressed space, which 

 is especially well-marked near the extremity of the arm. Except 

 within the disk and at the very base of arms, the vertebrae are more 

 or less or entirely divided into halves by fusiform pores, which 

 become larger and longer in the more distal part of the arm. Arm 

 spines two, sub ventral, unequal, glassy, all converted into compound 

 hooks, with a series of booklets along their ventral side, covered by 




50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



a thin, transparent skin; the lower one is much larger and longer 

 than the upper. On some basal arm joints there occurs on the 

 lateral arm plate one more spine, which is placed on the dorsal 

 margin of the plate and also bears a series of booklets on one side; it 

 is larger and longer than the other two and nearly as long as the 

 corresponding arm joint. No tentacle scale. Color in alcohol: 

 yellowish white. 



Two specimens; probably Sagami Sea. 



Subfamily 2. OPHIOBYRSIN^ nov. 



(Characters as given in key, p, 46.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiobyrsa, Ophiohyr sella, Ophiophrixus, 

 Ophiobrachion and provisionally Ophioschiza, besides a new genus, 

 Ophiosmilax. 



The Ophiobyrsinse rather approach the next two families in 

 skeletal characters. 



OPHIOSMILAX gen. nov. 



Disk and arms covered by a thick skin. Radial shields very 

 rudimentary and insignificant. Single oral papilla on either side 

 and two or three dental papillae at the apex of each jaw. Teeth in 

 a single vertical series. Teeth and papillae all alike, stout, stumpy, 

 conspicuously thorny at tips. Second oral tentacle pores open 

 outside oral slits, each provided with a thorny, stumpy papilla, 

 which arises from adoral shield. Dorsal arm plates absent, while 

 the lateral arm plates are subventral, so that the dorsal side of the 

 arms is merely covered by a naked skin. Ventral arm plates well- 

 developed, in contact with each other. Vertebrae short and very 

 stout. Vertebral articulation streptospondyline, the articular peg 

 being entirely absent. Arm spines few, converted into compound 

 hooks. No tentacle scale. 



This new genus more or less resembles Ophiophrixus in the total 

 absence of dorsal arm plates, but differs from it in the rudimentary 

 radial shields, in the peculiarities of teeth and papillae and in the 

 conversion of arm spines into compound hooks. The last character 

 reminds us of Ophiobrachion, but Ophiosmilax has no disk spines, 

 while it does have peculiai* teeth and papillae and fewer and longer 

 arm spines. 

 Ophiosmilax mirabilis sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 2 mm. Length of arms 12 mm. Width of arms 

 0.8 mm. Disk pentagonal, with concave interbrachial borders, 

 covered by a thick skin, which contains very fine, thin, transparent 




1915.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



scales. Radial shields rudimentary and insignificant, lying on the 

 disk margin. Genital slits very small and short. 



Oral shields triangular, with convex outer border. Adoral shields 

 large, quadrangular, meeting within. Oral slits short, fairly closed 

 up. Single oral papilla on either side, short, stumpy, conspicuously 

 thorny at tip, turned up ventrally, instead of projecting towards 

 oral slit. Two or three dental papillae at apex of each jaw, similar 

 in shape and in size to oral papilla, also turned up ventrally. Teeth 

 in a single vertical series, stout, stumpy, thorny at tips. Second 

 oral tentacle pores open outside oral slits, each provided with a 

 stumpy and thorny papilla, which arises from adoral shield. 



Arms stout in comparison with the small disk, covered by a thick, 

 naked skin. Dorsal arm plates absent. Lateral arm plates sub- 

 ventral, strongly flaring. First ventral arm plate large, quadran- 

 gular, with rounded angles, slightly longer than wide, much wider 

 without than within; those beyond also large, hexagonal; proximal 

 and proximo-lateral sides very short; distal and disto-lateral sides 

 long; outer angles perfectly rounded; as long as, or slightly longer 

 than, wide, feebly calcified and transparent, except the outer and 

 lateral margins, where the calcification is complete and opaque. 

 Vertebrae short and very stout, with streptospondyUne articulation, 

 the articular shoulder and umbo being very stout, while the articular 

 peg is entirely absent. Arm spines two or three, lying flat on the arm, 

 all converted into compound hooks, hyaline; the uppermost two are 

 subequal, about two-thirds as long as corresponding arm joint, while 

 the lowest one is about half as long as the same. The smaller spines 

 have two or three booklets, which lie in one plane, while the larger 

 ones have six or seven booklets, which lie in two divergent planes. 

 Tentacle pores small, without scales. Color in alcohol: brownish 

 yellow.

 communication; arms simple Asteroschematin^. 



Subfamily 1. ASTERONYCHIN^ nov. 



Disk very large, arms very slender and unbranched. A single 

 madreporite is present. Perihsemal canal entirely closed. Peri- 

 toneal cavity divided into five compartments by the interradial 

 attachments of the gastral pouches to body wall. Genital bursse 

 separated from the perihsemal canal and the peritoneal cavity, but 

 the pairs of the same radius communicating with each other, the 

 communication passing above the outer end of the oral frames and 

 the first vertebra, just outside the perihsemal canal. Lateral arm 

 plates of opposite sides separated by the comparatively large ventral 

 arm plates. Arm spines, 3-8. 



This subfamily includes Asteronyx and Astrodia.

 Asteroschema tubiferum Matsumoto. 



1911, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 23, p. 617 (in Japanese). 



This species strongly resembles A. rubrum Lyman, but differs 

 chiefly in the much coarser granules of the arm bases, in having 

 tentacle tubes for some ten basal tentacles, and in the relatively 

 longer and stouter arm spines. Three or four granules lie in 1 mm. 

 on the dorsal side of the free arm base. Oral tentacle pores, as 

 well as tentacle pores of some ten basal arm joints, open by means 

 of cuticular tubes, each of which, except that of the oral tentacle 

 and the first arm tentacle, is attached to the adradial arm spine on 

 its adradial side. The arm spines become longer and stouter distally, 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



till the adradial one is distinctly clavate and is about twice as long 

 as the correspondin'^ arm joint. The color is light pinkish brown 

 in alcohol. The type specimen is 16 mm. in disk diameter, 230 mm. 

 in arm length and 4.5 mm. in arm width at base. 



Two specimens; Okinose (a submarine bank), Sagami Sea. One 

 specimen; Sagami Sea. 



Asterosohema glaucum Matsumoto. 



1911, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 23, p. 617 (in Japanese). 



This species is near A. salix Lyman, but differs from it in coarser 

 granules on disk and arm bases, in stouter arm bases, in much shorter 

 arm spines, and in oral tentacles being enclosed in tubes. About 

 six granules lie in 1 mm. on the radial ribs and free arm bases. Arms 

 very stout at base, as high as wide. Arm spines longer and stouter 

 outwards, till the adradial one is somewhat clavate and is slightly 

 longer than the corresponding arm joint. Oral tentacles enclosed in 

 tubes. First two or three tentacle pores also provided with tubes, 

 though rudimentary. The color is pale gray in alcohol. The type 

 specimen is 11 mm. in disk diameter, 100 mm. in arm length and 

 4' mm. in arm width at base.

Asterosohema hemigymnum Matsumoto. 



1912, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 24, p. 381 (in Japanese) ; fig.s. 3, 4. 



Diameter of disk 10 mm. Length of arms 120 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 3 mm. Disk rather flat, divided into ten lobes, cor- 

 responding to the radial ribs, by ten radiating furrows; covered by 

 a skin, which contains very fine, smooth, close-set granules. Ventral 

 interbrachial areas rather vertical, narrow, forming a deep notch, 

 on the floor of which opens one madreporic pore. Genital slits 

 rather short, more or less divergent dorsally. Ventral surface of 

 disk covered by a finely and rather sparsely granulated skin. 



Oral angles not markedly set off from the outer parts. Six or 

 seven teeth arranged in a single vertical row, triangular, very stout. 

 On either side of the oral angles, there are several coarse, flat, smooth, 

 pavement-like grains, which correspond to oral papillae. 



Arms very stout for the first three or four free joints, but becoming 

 rather slender further out; their width just outside the fourth free 

 joint is 2.5 mm. They constantly taper outwards, so that they are 

 exceedingly slender towards the extremities, which are very acute. 

 Dorsal and lateral surface of the arms covered by a skin, which is 

 similar to that of the disk, containing very fine, smooth, close-set 




54 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



granules, of which there are about five in 1 mm. on the dorsal surface 

 of the arm bases. The granules become much finer outwards, and 

 almost disappear near extremity of arm. Vertebrae visible through 

 skin, but surface of arm practically smooth and without distinct 

 demarcation of joints, except of first three or four, which are marked 

 off by shallow constrictions. Ventral surface of arms entirely 

 naked, and lateral and ventral arm plates clearly visible through 

 skin. First tentacle pore unprotected; next four or five pores 

 provided with a single arm spine, and the rest with two. Abradial 

 spine very small, cylindrical, enclosed in skin, more or less rough 

 at free end. Adradial one clavate, enclosed in skin, very rough at 

 free end. Arm spines largest at middle of arm, the adradial one 

 being one and a half times as long as, and the abradial one a little 

 shorter than, the corresponding arm joint. They are transformed 

 into compound hooks, with three to six booklets, towards the very 

 extremity of the arm. Oral tentacle pore and first three or four 

 tentacle pores provided with tubes. Color in alcohol: grayish brown. 



One specimen; Sagami Sea. 



Like A. intedum layman and A. migrator Koehler, this species 

 appears to be an intermediate form between the sections Asteroschema, 

 s. str., and Ophiocreas. 

 Astrocharis ijimai Matsumoto. 



1911, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 23, p. 617 (in Japanese). 



Diameter of disk 4.5 mm. Length of arms 50 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 2.5 mm. Disk five-lobed, with deeply indented inter- 

 brachial borders, with lobes emarginate towards arms, flat, sunken 

 at the central region, raised at the lobes, covered with very fine, 

 smooth, irregular scales, which are very close-set and partly imbri- 

 cated. Radial shields naked, very small, triangular, with apex 

 turned within, tuberculous when examined under a microscope. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas with very deep notches, exceedingly 

 narrowed by the very wide arm bases. Two genital slits small, 

 parallel, nearly vertical. On either side of each lobe of the disk, 

 lies the naked genital plate, which is large, oval, and tuberculous 

 under a microscope. 



Oral angles puffed laterally, almost filling up the oral slits. Teeth 

 small, triangular, arranged in a single vertical row. No oral or 

 dental papillae. 



Arms very wide at base, keeping the same width for a distance of 

 about 4 or 5 mm., then rather rapidly narrowed, becoming slender 

 and cyhndrical, with a width of about 1 mm.; covered with fine 




1915,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



scales similar to those of the disk. Arm joints invisible in the 

 proximal part of the arm, but more or less distinct distally. First 

 tentacle pore free of arm spines; those beyond provided with a single 

 spine, which is very small, short, peg-like, somewhat flattened, 

 rough at the end as seen under a microscope, lying flat on the ventral 

 surface of the arm. Half way out on the arm, each tentacle pore 

 is provided with two spines, of which the second, or abradial one, 

 is exceedingly small and rather inconspicuous; the adradial one 

 then becomes a little longer and erect to the arm. Color in alcohol : 

 white or pale yellow. 



Numerous specimens; Sagami Sea. 



In smaller specimens, the arms are scarcely widened at the base, 

 which is also the case in regenerating ones; for schizogony takes 

 place in this species as in the genotype, A. virgo Koehler. Most 

 specimens are five-armed, but the arms are often unequal, two or 

 three being larger than the others. I have, however, one specimen 

 with six arms, three larger and three smaller. In four-armed speci- 

 mens, two or three arms may be larger and the other two or one 

 smaller. Still another specimen has only three arms, doubtless 

 indicating that it has lately undergone division, and that the lost 

 parts have not been regenerated.

Diameter of disk, 22 mm. Distance from centre of disk to inter- 

 radial margin, 8.5 mm. Distance from outer end of oral slit to first 

 bifurcation of arm, 11 mm. Arms branched nineteen or twentj^ 

 times, measuring about 125 mm. in total length. Width of ventral 

 side of arm base within disk, 4.5 mm. Disk five-lobed, with concave 

 interbrachial borders, covered by a thick skin, which is apparently 

 smooth, but contains fine, close-set granules of microscopic size. 

 On the radial ribs these granules are flattened, pavement-like and 

 coarser, being even visible to the naked eye. Several smooth, 

 hemispherical tubercles are scattered on the disk. Radial ribs 

 gently raised, forming rounded ridges, with rather indistinct out- 

 lines, not quite reaching to the disk centre; their back is marked 

 with concentrically arranged swellings, corresponding to the imbri- 

 cating, soldered plates, of which the radial shield is composed. The 

 ventral surface of the disk appears smooth to the naked eye. Genital 

 slits not very large. 



Madreporic shield single, at inner corner of a ventral interbrachial 

 area, small, transversely oval. Teeth and dental papillae, conical 

 and rather stout. Oral papillae and lower dental papillae, smaller 

 and very short.

granulated skin, with several scattered, smooth, hemispherical 

 tubercles on the more proximal shafts; distinctly annulated with 

 hook-bearing segments throughout. Ventral surface of arms 

 entirely smooth. Arm spines, which are present beyond first bifur- 

 cation, very fine and three or four in number at each tentacle pore. 

 Color in alcohol: disk mottled and arms annulated with yellowish 

 and grayish brown.

This species can be easily distinguished from other species of 

 Astrodadus by the entirely smooth disk covering and by the arms, 

 which are distinctl3^ annulated with hook-bearing segments even 

 at the very base. 

 Astroboa arctos sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk, 65 mm. Distance from centre of disk to inter- 

 radial margin, 25 mm. Distance from outer end of oral slit to first 

 bifurcation, 32 mm. Arms branched about thirty-seven times, 

 measuring approximately 420 mm. in total length. Width of 

 ventral surface of arm base within disk, 17 mm. 



Disk decagonal, with concave interbrachial and brachial borders, 

 the former being longer and more concave than the latter; very high 

 and convex, but with more or less depressed central region, covered 

 by a thick skin, which is shagreened by the presence of very fine, 

 close-set granules. The granules are smooth, not acute, irregular 

 in size, when viewed under a microscope, the coarser ones being 

 more numerous on the radial ribs than in the intercostal spaces. 

 Radial ribs long, narrow, bar-like, widest at outer end, suddenly 

 narrowed for a very short distance, then uniformly tapered inwards, 

 nearly reaching disk-centre. Ventral interbrachial areas covered 

 by thick, apparently smooth skin, which, however, contains fine 

 microscopical granules. Genital slits rather large, adradial border 

 protected by a cluster of close-set spinules. 



Madreporic shield, situated at inner angle of a ventral inter- 

 brachial area, more or less semilunar, with semicircular inner, and 

 distinctly notched outer, side and rounded lateral angles. Areas 

 proximal to ventral interbrachial regions, apparently smooth, but 

 ■closely covered with very fine granules of microscopic size, the 

 granules being rather coarse and distinct at the oral angles. Teeth 

 and papillae very numerous; oral and dental papillae, rather small, 

 spiniform, and not very acute; teeth, much larger and longer than 

 papillae, distinctly spatulated, and flattened at tip. 



Two main stems, outside the first bifurcation, of an arm are not

equally developed, but one is longer, stouter and more branched 

 than the other. Dorsal and lateral surface of arms covered by a 

 thick skin, which is very finely and closely granulated; granules, 

 irregular in size and roughly distinguished as of two kinds; finer 

 ones entirely covered by skin, flat, irregularly polygonal, forming 

 together a sort of mosaic; coarser ones, coarser than any granules 

 of disk, hemispherical, tubercle-like, and uniformly scattered. 

 Ventral surface of arms apparently smooth, but covered by a mosaic 

 of flat and irregularly polygonal granules of microscopic size. First 

 pair of tentacle pores distinct, opening in slight depressions; second 

 often distinct; following three or four pairs entirely invisible; those 

 beyond are again distinct. Arm spines absent on proximal joints, 

 but occur from fourth or fifth bifurcation outwards. They are 

 exceedingly minute and granule-like, two to four of them occurring 

 at each tentacle pore. The double rows of hook-bearing granules 

 are present only on very fine twigs, the main stems within four- 

 teenth or fifteenth bifurcation being free from them. The shaft 

 between the first and second bifurcations usually consists of four 

 arm joints; the outer shafts consist of six to eight, usually seven 

 joints. Color in alcohol, as well as when dry: dark grayish brown 

 above, and dark yellowish brown below. 



Two specimens; off Misaki Marine Biological Station; 5-10 

 fathoms. Four specimens; Sagami Sea. 



Among the five known species of Astrohoa, A. clcwata (Lyman) is 

 distinguished from the others by the spiny granules of the disk and 

 arms, and A. globifera (Doderlein) by the position of the madreporic 

 shield. A. nuda (Lyman) and A. nigra Doderlein have distinct 

 annulations of hook-bearing granules on the arms throughout, while 

 A. ernos Doderlein has no such annulations on the greater proximal 

 part of the arms. So that the present species is near A. ernce, but 

 differs from it in the much finer and less distinct granules of the disk 

 and arms, and in the less numerous arm joints composing a shaft. 

 In the last character, A. arctos rather resembles A. nigra from 

 Zanzibar and from Hirado Strait. 



This species is common in the shallow waters around Misaki, 

 occurring together with Astrocladus conijerus, especially var. dofleini 

 [A. dofleini Doderlein is, in my opinion, conspecific with A. coniferus 

 (Doderlein), being, however, a variety of the latter]. According to 

 present knowledge, Astrohoa is represented in the Sagami Sea by 

 A. globifera and the present species, in deep and shallow water 

 respectively.

Subfamily 2. ASTROTOMINiE nov. 



(Characters as given in keys, p. 55.) 



This subfamily includes Astrothrombus, Astrothorax, Astrotoma 

 and Astroclon, besides a new genus, Astrothamnus. 



Astrothamnus gen. nov. 



Disk divided into ten radiating lobes by radial and interradial 

 furrows, closely covered with coarse granules or stumpy tubercles, 

 which are acute or thorny at tips. Ventral interradial areas strongly 

 concave, with large, long, more or less parallel genital slits. Teeth 

 and dental papillae similar, spiniform, forming a cluster at the apex 

 of each jaw. Oral papillae absent, so that the sides of the oral slits 

 are naked. Arms simple, distinctly annulated by zones of densely 

 set, minute, compound hooks; the interannuli are covered with 

 coarse granules, which are arranged more or less clearly in two 

 series. Arm spines 3-5, peg-like, usually rough at tips, serving as 

 tentacle scales. 



This genus includes Koehler's Astrotoma hellator, A. vecors and A. 

 rigens, besides the genotype, Astrothamnus ecJmiaceus sp. nov. 



Astrothamnus is distinguished from genuine Astrotoma as follows: 



A — Disk covered with coarse granules or stumpy tubercles, which 

 are acute or thorny at tip; arms annulated by conspicuous 

 zones of densely set compound hooks; interannuli of arms 

 covered with coarse granules, which are arranged more or less 

 clearly in two series Astrothamnus. 



AA — Disk covered with very fine, smooth granules, often beset 

 with a number of smooth, stumpy tubercles; arms rather 

 inconspicuously annulated, each annulus consisting of four 

 rows of granules, the middle two hook-bearing, while the 

 others are smooth; interannuli covered by a pavement of 

 very fine granules, among which many oval, sunken plates 

 are present Astrotoma, restr. 



In the arm coverings, Astrothamnus is similar to Astrothrombus 

 and Astrothorax, while Astrotojna, restr., resembles Astroclon. Thus 

 the Astrotominae fall naturally into two groups, one of which includes 

 the first three genera, and the other the last two.

the radial furrow. Radial ribs much raised, large, occupying almost 

 the whole dorsal surface of disk, but leaving between them ten 

 narrow furrows radiating from the centre; closely covered with 

 rather large stumpy tubercles with thorny crowns, between which 

 lie thick, irregularly polygonal plates. Ventral interbrachial areas 

 strongly concave, closely covered with stumpy tubercles terminating 

 with one or a few thorny points. Genital slits rather large, more 

 or less parallel. 



Madreporic shield small, irregular in outline. Areas proximal to 

 ventral interbrachial regions closely covered with spiny, stumpy 

 tubercles. Oral angles ventrally projected, covered with conical 

 and acute tubercles, which become, near mouth, more or less indis- 

 tinguishable from dental papillae. Teeth and dental papillae similar, 

 conical, very acute. Oral papillae absent; sides of oral angles naked. 



Arms rather slender, long, uniformly tapered outwards, distinctly 

 annulated by double rows of coarse granules, which are entirely 

 covered with densely set, minute, compound hooks; interannuli 

 covered with coarse, smooth granules arranged in two irregular 

 rows. Ventro-laterally on either side of arm, in line with interannuli, 

 there is a series of large, round, smooth plates. At the arm bases, 

 the hook-covered annuli are usually broken in the dorsal median 

 line by conical granules terminating with one or a few thorny points. 

 Ventral side of arms with rather well-spaced tubercles, which are 

 conical or terminate with one or a few thorny points; these tubercles 

 become rounded and smooth distally. First and second tentacle 

 pores free of arm spines; third with one or two spines; fourth with 

 two or three; remainder with three. Arm spines of basal joints 

 more or less indistinguishable from conical or thorned tubercles, 

 but remainder peg-like, nearly as long as corresponding arm joint, 

 and bearing two or three denticles at tip. Oral tentacle pores, as 

 well as first and second arm tentacle pores, open by means of short 

 tubes, which bear a few spinules on the sides. Color in alcohol: 

 dull grayish purple. 



Two specimens, Sagami Sea. 



In Koehler's species, vecors and rigens, the brachial ventral surfaces 

 are smooth and the oral angles, as well as the spaces just proximal 

 to the ventral interbrachial areas, are provided with slender spines, 

 while in A. bellator (Koehler), as well as in the present species, the 

 brachial ventral surfaces, oral angles and the oral spaces referred to 

 are provided with coarse, stumpy granules or tubercles. The present 

 species, however, differs from A. bellator in fewer and distinctly longer 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



arm spines and in the presence of a series of large plates on either 

 side of each arm. 



Astrotoma Lyman (non Koehler). 



As I have referred Koehler's three species, which he placed in 

 Astrotoma, to Astrothamnus, Astrotoma, restr., now includes A. 

 agassizi Lyman, A. murrayi Lyman, A. sobrina Matsumoto, and 

 A. waitei Benham, the first being the genotype. 



Astrotoma sobrina Matsumoto.

PI. VII, figs. 14-146. 



Though the present Japanese form was identified as A. murrayi 

 by Doderlein, I have failed to find any specimen from Japan that 

 strictly corresponds to Lyman's description and figures of the Moluc- 

 can species, so that I am ol^liged to look upon the Japanese form as 

 distinct from A. murrayi. It differs from that species in the much 

 shorter arms, in the narrower brachial lobes of the disk (narrower 

 outwards than inwards), in the longer genital slits, in the fewer and 

 larger stumpy tubercles in the spaces just proximal to the ventral 

 interbrachial areas, and in the comparatively fewer arm spines. 

 The type specimen measures 34 mm. across disk and 200 mm. in arm 

 length, while A. murrayi is described as 29 mm. across the disk and 

 280 mm. in arm leng-th. The brachial lobes of the disk are not so 

 wide as in A. murrayi, and are narrower outwards than inwards, 

 instead of the reverse. The genital slits extend from the inner 

 corners of the ventral interbrachial areas nearly to the disk margin. 

 The spaces just proximal to the ventral interbrachial areas are beset 

 with a few large stumpy tubercles, instead of numerous small ones. 

 First tentacle pore free of arm spines; second with one or two; 

 third, two or three; fourth, three or four; and succeeding, four, or 

 sometimes three. In A. murrayi, four or sometimes five arm spines 

 are present at each tentacle pore, even on the very basal arm joints. 

 However, A. sobrina is very close to A. murrayi, the covering of the 

 disk and arms being quite similar in the two species. But I consider 

 that this similarity is generic rather than specific, as I have observed 

 that the arm covering of the genotype, A. agassizi, is also precisely 

 similar to that of the present species. 



Five specimens; Sagami Sea.

 lateral wings. Dorsal arm plates often very small, while the lateral 

 arm plates are very well developed, those of opposite sides usually 

 meeting both above and below.

Ophiacantha bisquamata sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 6 mm. Length of arms 34 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 mm. Disk pentagonal, with nearly straight or 

 slightly convex interbrachial borders, closely covered with fine 

 granules, of which eight or nine lie in 1 mm. Radial shields entirely 

 concealed, very small, bar-like, separated from each other. Ventral 

 interbrachial areas similar to the dorsal side, but proximally free of 

 granules and covered with fine scales. Genital slits long, nearly 

 reaching the disk margin. 



Oral shields small, rhomboidal, with convex inner sides and rounded 

 outer angle, nearly as long as, or slightly longer than wide, in contact 

 with the first lateral arm plates. Adoral shields small, triangular, 

 pointed inwards, meeting each other. Five or six oral papillae on 

 either side of each jaw; the outermost two are flat and leaf -like, 

 protecting the second oral tentacle pore; the others are very narrow 

 and acute; the innermost one, which pairs with that of the other 

 side, is infradental. Four or five teeth in a single vertical row, more

•or less stout, obtuse. Arms composed of rather short and wide 

 joints, uniformly tapered. Dorsal arm plates rhomboidal, with 

 very obtuse inner angle, wider than long, with a more or less distinct 

 median keel, so that the dorsal side of the arm is keeled as a whole. 

 Lateral arm plates with prominent spine ridges, meeting neither 

 Above or below. First ventral arm plate very small, quadrangular, 

 with concave inner side, longer than wide; those following, mod- 

 erately large, pentagonal, with convex, but slightly notched, outer 

 side and rounded outer angles, nearly as long as wide. Six arm 

 spines long, flattened, more or less curved, truncate, translucent, 

 not serrate; uppermost or upper second spine longest, about twice 

 and a half as long as corresponding arm joint; lowest one, shortest, 

 slightly longer than arm joint. Two oval, thin, leaf-like tentacle 

 scales to each pore. Color in alcohol: disk grayish brown, with or 

 without white patches on dorsal side at insertion of arm bases; 

 arms banded with grayish brown and white. The grayish brown and 

 white in alcohol correspond, in life, to dark green and vivid red, 

 respectively. 



Two specimens: off Oshima, Sagami Sea; 75-85 fathoms. 

 OpMothamnus venustus sp. nov. 



This species is very near Ophiomitra habrotata H. L. Clark, but 

 I have some doubt as to the identity of the two species, since certain 

 differences are observable between them as now known. The 

 present species has fine, acute, scattered spines on the disk, without 

 any of the large, conspicuous spines, characteristic of 0. habrotata. 

 The arm spines of the present species are eight to ten in number to 

 each lateral arm plate on free basal arm joints. 



Numerous specimens; off Inatori, Izu, Sagami Bay. 



The internal structure of the present species is quite similar to 

 those of the genotype, 0. vicarius Lyman, the peristomal plates 

 being triple, the genital plates situated above the basal vertebrae, 

 the genital scales absent and the generative glands lined by an 

 unfolded membrane, which contains fine scales, as seen under a 

 microscope. 



The species referred to Ophiothamnus by modern systematists 

 are of a type not considered Ophiothamnus by Lyman, while certain 

 species, which are quite congeneric with Lyman's type of the present 

 genus, have been referred to other genera. For examples, Ophioleda 

 minima and Ophioplinthaca occlusa of Koehler, and Ophiomitra 

 habrotata H. L. Clark, are, in my opinion, genuine Ophiothamnus^ 

 while Ophiomitra exigua Lyman (referred to Ophiothamnus by 




64 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Verrill), Ophiomitra dicycla H. L. Clark, Ophiothamnus Icevis Lutken 

 and Mortensen, and Ophiothamnus stultus Koehler are not genuine 

 Ophiothamnus, but belong to a distinct type, which awaits a name, 

 being more or less related to Ophiomytis and Ophioplinthaca. 

 Ophiolebes tuberosus sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 10 mm. Length of arms 38 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 mm. Disk five-lobed, with strongly concave 

 interbrachial borders, deeply hollowed at the central region, covered 

 by a thick, cereous skin, which contains well-spaced, thick, rounded 

 scales of various sizes; beset with several short, conical, stout, 

 obtuse tubercles, which are larger and more numerous on the radial 

 shields. Radial shields also covered by the skin, long, narrow, 

 bar-like, strongly raised, about two-thirds as long as the disk radius. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas covered by a skin similar to that of the 

 dorsal side, the scales and tubercles being, however, smaller. Genital 

 slits large, long, but not reaching disk margin. Oral shields small,, 

 thick, rhomboidal, wider than long, with wide, rounded outer angle 

 and convex surface. Adoral shields large, quadrangular, with 

 perfectly rounded outer angles and strongly convex surface, wider 

 without than within, meeting each other. Between each pair of 

 oral plates occurs a more or less distinct buccal pore. Three, or 

 sometimes four, oral papillsB on either side, conical and blunt; inner 

 ones smaller; outermost papilla, very large and stout. Oral papillae 

 project laterally beyond radial axis, and those on opposite sides of 

 each oral slit are placed alternately. Teeth conical, stout, obtuse. 



Arms slender, covered by a thin, cereous skin. Dorsal arm plates 

 two to each joint; proximal plate small, quadrangular, wider than 

 long, with a convex surface; on distal part of arm it becomes longer 

 than wide; distal plate large, fan-shaped, much wider than long^ 

 and with a convex surface. Dorsal side of arm bases covered by 

 continuation of disk covering, so that it bears thick, rounded scales 

 of various sizes in place of dorsal arm plates. Lateral arm plates 

 somewhat flaring, meeting below for a short distance. First ventral 

 arm plate comparatively large, hexagonal, with concave inner side 

 and convex surface, widest at the lateral angles, as long as, or slightly 

 longer than, wide, in contact with the next plate; the latter is the 

 largest of all, pentagonal, widest at lateral angles, as long as, or 

 slightly longer than, wide, with convex surface and a conspicuous 

 notch in distal margin; following plates separated from each other^ 

 rhomboidal, with a conspicuous notch in distal margin, with strongly 

 convex surface; distally they become smaller, oval or rounded, and

the surface is so convex that they appear Hke hemispherical tubercles. 

 Arm spines five in number on proximal joints, but four distally; 

 they are conical, blunt, solid, terete; dorsal ones longer and stouter; 

 uppermost about one and a half times, and lowest about two-thirds, 

 as long as corresponding arm joint. Tentacle scales absent. Color 

 in alcohol: yellowish brown. 



Numerous specimens; Okinose (a submarine bank), Sagami Sea. 



In younger specimens, the skin, which covers the disk and arms, 

 is very thick and the buccal pores are often indistinct.

This species closely resembles Ophioceramis f ohstricta Lyman 

 (= Ophiomoeris ohstricta Koehler, 1904 = Ophiurases obstrictus Clark, 

 1911), but differs in two important points. The radial shields are 

 distinctly joined in pairs distally for half their length. A number 

 of large, prominent, spherical tubercles are present on the disk, 

 irregularly arranged along the distal margin of the radial plates, along 

 the joining line of each pair of radial shields, and often also along 

 the outer borders of the same. In the last character, the present 

 species reminds us of Ophiogyptis nodosa. The type specimen 

 measures 4 mm. across the disk, 13 mm. in the arm length and 1.5 

 mm. in the arm width at base. Color in alcohol: disk gray, arms 

 banded with grayish browTi and white.

(Characters as given above in key.) 



This family includes Amphilepis and Ophiochytra, besides a new 

 genus, Amphiactis. Though almost similar to the next in external 

 features, this family suggests the Ophiacanthidae in many internal 

 structures. 



Amphiactis gen. nov. 



Disk covered with imbricating scales, besides moderately large 

 radial shields. Four or five oral papillae on either side of each jaw,

triangular, with pointed ends; dental papillse absent. Peristomal 

 plates large, entire. Oral frames long and slender in internal view, 

 without well-developed lateral wings. Vertebrae of distal arm joints 

 often incompletely divided by a series of pores. Arm spines few. 

 Tentacle scales present, one or two to each pore. 



This genus includes Amphiura canescens, duplicata, and patula 

 of Lyman; Amphiura partita, Ophiactis dissideris and 0. parata of 

 Koehler, besides the genotype, Amphiadis umbonata sp. nov. 



Certain representatives of the present genus were referred to 

 Amphiura by Lyman, and then to Ophiactis by Liitken and Mor- 

 tensen. Amphiadis differs from Amphiura and its allies in the 

 absence of paired infradental papillae, and from Ophiadis in the more 

 numerous papillae, which are arranged in a continuous series so as to 

 close the oral slits. Further, the contrast of the present genus and 

 the Amphiuridm in many internal structures is decidedly striking. 

 Amphiadis much resembles Ophiochytra, especially 0. tenuis Lyman, 

 but differs from it in the well -developed radial shields. 

 Amphiactis umbonata sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 7 mm. Length of arms 30 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.2 mm. Disk circular, flat, covered with rather 

 coarse, irregular scales, among which the primaries are distinct. 

 Central plate large, circular, encircled by ten small scales, which 

 correspond to infrabasals and basals in position. Radial plates 

 large, larger than central plate, with strongly curved outer border, 

 which almost forms a semicircle. The central and radial plates 

 have each a small but distinct central boss. The second radials and 

 the first to third interradials may also be distinguished, being larger 

 than the secondary scales, which are irregular in size and in arrange- 

 ment. Thus, the disk squamation is rather similar to that of 

 Ophiozona. Radial shields comparatively small, oblong ovate, about 

 two-fifths as long as disk radius, twice as long as wide, wider without 

 than within, more convex abradially than adradially, separated by 

 a row of three or four plates, of which the inner ones are larger than 

 the outer. In each interradial area there are five to seven irregu- 

 larly radiating rows of scales. Ventral interbrachial areas covered 

 with more or less coarse, irregular scales. Genital slits long, nearly 

 reaching disk margin. Genital scales invisible in external view. 



Oral shields small, rhomboidal, with acute inner angle, lateral 

 and outer angles rounded, inner sides slightly concave. Adoral 

 shields quadrangular, wider without than within, nearly or quite 

 meeting within. Four oral papillae on either side, inner ones smaller 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



and more acute. Deep in oral slits, on either side of each jaw, occurs 

 an additional papilla, which is conical and acute. Five teeth, all 

 obtuse, except uppermost, which is acute. 



Arms slender, flattened, uniformly tapering distally. Dorsal arm 

 plates large, fan-shaped, twice as wide as long; inner sides slightly 

 convex, forming an obtuse angle within; distal margin decidedly 

 convex; outer angles rounded; successive plates separated by 

 lateral arm plates, except the basal two or three, which are in contact 

 with each other. Lateral arm plates low, not very prominent. 

 First ventral arm plate small, divided into two secondary plates, 

 of which the inner one is triangular and the outer quadrangular; 

 those following, large, hexagonal (except second, which is pentag- 

 onal), much wider than long, widest at outer lateral angles, with 

 concave lateral sides, distal and proximal margins slightly convex; 

 swollen along the outer margins and especially distally, so that 

 arm appears keeled along ventral median line. Arm spines three, 

 subequal, about as long as corresponding arm joint (uppermost 

 slightly longer), cylindrical, tapered and blunt. Two flat, oval 

 tentacle scales to each pore, but sometimes three on the first. Color 

 in alcohol: white. 



Two specimens; Sagami Sea. 



The internal structures of the present species are essentially 

 similar to those of Amphilepis norvegica Ljungman. The peristomal 

 plates are simple, very large. The oral frames are entire, without 

 lateral wings. The oral plates in internal view are very slender and 

 long. The dental plates are absent, so that the teeth arise directly 

 from the oral plates. The genital plates are free from, instead of 

 being fixed to, the basal vertebrae. The genital plate and radial 

 shield of either side of a radius articulate with each other bj^ means 

 of a conspicuous, ball-like condyle on the former and of a large 

 socket in the latter. The genital scales are flat, thin, leaf-like. The 

 vertebrae are very slender, the distal ones being incompletely divided 

 into halves by a series of pores. The first five characters and the 

 last are rather Lsemophiuridan, but the other two, the sixth and 

 seventh, are strictly Gnathophiuridan.

 AmphiphoUs-group, and the last five as an Amphiura-group. The 

 Amphipholi s-gvoup are very easily distinguished, while the other 

 three groups are less so. These groups may be distinguished as 

 follows : 



Three classes of oral papillse may be recognized: the first arising 

 from the adoral shields, the second from the oral plates, and the 

 third from the dental plates and being infradental in position. A 

 papilla, which arises partially from the adoral shield and partially 

 from the oral plate, is referred to the second class. Now, let +1 

 indicate the presence of papillae of the first class, —I the absence of 

 same; +11 the presence of papillae of the second class, etc. Then, 

 the groups of genera are formulized as follows: 



Amphioplus-group = +1 +11 +III. 



Amphiodia-group = — I +11 +III. 



Amphipholis-group = — I +11 +III. 



A7nphiura-group = +1 ±11 +III. 



It may clearly be seen that the A?7iphiodia-group are not inter- 

 mediate between Amphioplus- and Atnphiura-group, but are, say, 

 the A)nphioplus-group without the papillae of the first class, while 

 the Amphiura-group are the Amphioplus-group without all or most 

 of the papillse of the second class. I believe that certain species 

 having two distal papillae, usually referred to Amphiodia, are really 

 referable to Amphiura. 



Apphang the same principle to the Ophiactininae and Ophio- 

 trichidae, we have the following formulae: 



2 Hemipholis rnicrodiscus Duncan, 1870, is evidently a genuine Amphiura.

Ophiophragmus japonicus sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 7 mm. Length of arms 45 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1 mm. Disk five-lobed, with very convex inter- 

 brachial borders, covered with fine, imbricating scales, among which 

 the six primaries are more or less distinguishable. Radial shields 

 semilunar, one-third as long as disk radius, twice as long as wide, 

 joined in pairs, being, however, separated only at proximal end, 

 which is obtusely pointed. A row of large and squarish scales 

 borders disk. Scales of ventral interbrachial areas just outside 

 this marginal series turned up, so as to form the sort of fence 

 characteristic of genus. Marginal scales more elevated than arms; 

 ventral interbrachial areas strongly convex below. Genital slits 

 long. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, with inner sides much longer than outer, 

 inner angle very acute, outer and lateral angles rounded; much 

 longer than wide. Adoral shields triangular, tapered within to a 

 point, not meeting each other. Four oral papillae on either side of 

 each jaw, close-set, subequal, blunt, innermost somewhat stouter. 



Dorsal arm plates elliptical, large, outer border curved, inner 

 border strongly convex, forming part of a circle; as wide as arms, 

 twice as wide as long, slightly in contact with each other. Lateral 

 arm plates inserted like so many wedges between successive dorsal 

 arm plates above and ventral plates below; well separated above and 

 nearly so below. First ventral arm plate very small, quadrangular, 

 much wider than long; those beyond pentagonal, with very large 

 inner angle, and slightly notched distal margin, wider than long, 

 only a little in contact with each other. Arm spines three, conical, 

 subequal, blunt, nearly as long as corresponding arm joint. Two 

 very flat, thin tentacle scales; inner one smaller than outer and 

 overlaps its base. Color in alcohol: light yellow. 



Numerous specimens; Kagoshima Gulf; 8-L5 fathoms. Two speci- 

 mens; Enoura, Suruga. 



This species somewhat resembles 0. affinis Duncan, especially in 

 number of oral papillae, but differs from it in shape of radial shields, 

 oral shields and of dorsal arm plates. In my opinion, AmphipJiolis 

 andrece Liitken, Amphiura prcestans Koehler and Amphiodia perierda 

 H. L. Clark are referable to Ophiophragmus, each showing certain 

 affinities to the present species.

Amphipholis japonica sp. nov. 



This species is extremely near A. squamata, being distinguished 

 from it merely by certain trifling differences. I have compared the 

 Japanese material with specimens of A. squamata from Naples. In 

 Neapolitan specimens the arms are two and a half to three times as 

 long as the disk diameter, while in Japanese specimens they are 

 three to four times as long as the same. The distal margin of the 

 ventral arm plates of Neapolitan specimens is nearly straight, while 

 that of Japanese specimens is considerably convex. In the last 

 character the present species resembles A. australiana H. L. Clark, 

 differing, however, from that species in the more numerous disk 

 scales of the dorsal side and in the coarser disk scales of the ventral 

 side. The radial shields have each a white spot at the outer end, 

 quite as \n A. squamata. 



Like A. squamata, the present species is viviparous. In summer, 

 the larger individuals contain- several embryos. I once dissected 

 out six embryos from an adult. Animals containing full-grown 

 embryos appear to give birth to them the night after they are placed 

 in an aquarium. 



This species is common in the neighborhood of jNIisaki, and is 



found living under stones on fine sand. As to the sensibility of this 



species to the coarseness of sand, the following observations were 



made at Arai Beach, Misaki Marine Biological Station. In the 



summer of 1910, the beach was at first abundantly supplied with 



small areas among rocks covered with fine sand, and this ophiuran 



was found very abundantly; after a heavy storm, very few individuals 



were found, owing to the fact that the spots with fine sand were 



mostly wiped out. In the summer of 1911, the spots with fine sand 



were very few, and this ophiuran was seldom found. In the summer 



of 1912, the beach was entirely covered with coarse sand, and I 



could no more find this ophiuran. It is a very active species, quickly 



concealing itself in the sand when the stone is turned up.

there are several rows of fine, imbricating scales. Radial shields 

 large, long, pear-seed-shaped; naked part two-thirds to one-half as 

 long as disk radius and about thrice as long as wide. Genital slits 

 long. Genital scales not very conspicuous unless the specimen is 

 dried, arranged in a row and overlapping one another. 



Oral shields small, pentagonal, with rounded angles, outer sides 

 longest, inner side slightly concave; maclrepofic shield much larger 

 than the rest, almost circular. Adoral shields small, triangular, 

 with concave adradial side, meeting neither radially or interradially. 

 Oral plates long and very narrows There is a more or less con- 

 spicuous buccal pore between each pair of oral plates, as in Ophio- 

 thrix. Two oral papillse on either side of each jaw, conical, blunt, 

 very stout; the distal one arises from the adoral shield and is longer 

 than the apical one, which arises from the dental plate. Teeth very 

 stout, truncate. 



Arms exceedingly long, more than thirty times as long as disk 

 diameter; they are widest at about one-third their entire length 

 from base. Dorsal arm plates almost oval, bounded within by two 

 nearly straight lines, forming a very large and obtuse angle, and 

 without by a curve, which is nearly flat towards median line, but 

 very strong laterally; about twice as wide as long, successive plates 

 slightly in contact with each other. On basal arm joints, they are 

 very small and separated by spaces, which are covered by a naked 

 skin. Lateral' arm plates not very prominent, almost covered by 

 arm spines, not meeting above or below, nor in contact on sides, but 

 separated by naked spaces. First ventral arm plate very small, 

 quadrangular, wider than long; those beyond, quadrangular, wider 

 than long, except basal one or two, which are as long as, or longer 

 than, w4de; they increase in size, especially in width, outwards, 

 and become pentagonal beyond disk, with large and obtuse inner 

 angle, rounded outer angles and notched distal margin; successive 

 plates separated by narrow spaces where ventral ends of lateral arm 

 plates are wedged in. Ventral arm plates often divided into halves 

 along median line. Arm spines six to seven on basal arm joints, 

 but five or six in middle part of arm, peg-like, flattened, blunt, lower 

 ones longer, nearly equal to, or slightly longer than, corresponding 

 arm joint, much flattened and thorny at end, except the uppermost 

 one or two; next to lowest, spur-shaped and very thorny. Large 

 tentacle pores, without scales. Color in alcohol: brown; the scales 

 around the radial shields are lighter; outer parts of arms grayish- 

 brown to gray.

Numerous specimens; Sakurajima, Kagoshima Gulf. 



This sjiecies is very near Ophionephthys phalerata Lyman, but 

 differs from it in the much larger radial shields, in the not oval but 

 pentagonal oral shields, in the adoral shields, which are not in contact 

 with each other, in the longer oral plates, in the dorsal arm plates 

 being in contact with each other, in the ventral arm plates being 

 separated from each other and not very wide on the basal joints, and 

 in the not cylindrical, but flattened, thorny arm spines. 

 Amphiura aestuarii sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk, 6 mm. Length of arms, 75 mm. Width of 

 arms at base, 0.8 mm. Disk five-lobed, with concave interbrachial 

 borders, covered by a soft, naked skin, except along inner and abra- 

 dial borders of radial shields, where it is covered by fine, imbricating 

 scales, arranged in four or five rows on inner border, but in only 

 one on outer part of abradial border. Naked part of radial shields 

 large, pear-seed-shaped, more than half as long as disk radius, more 

 than twice as long as wide, hardly in contact without, slightly diver- 

 gent within. Genital slits long. Genital scales not very distinct. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, or pentagonal with a very short inner 

 side, outer angle much rounded; wider than long. Madreporic 

 shield much larger and almost circular. Adoral shields triangular, 

 with concave inner side, tapered within, where they do not meet. 

 Two pairs of oral papillae to each jaw; apical ones oval and very 

 stout; distal ones conical, obtuse, arising from adoral shields. Teeth 

 stout, truncate. 



Dorsal arm plates transversely elliptical, twice as wide as long, 

 successive plates in contact with each other. Lateral arm plates 

 not very prominent, almost covered by arm spines, not meeting 

 above or below, not in contact on sides, but separated by naked spaces. 

 First ventral arm plate very small, pentagonal or quadrangular, 

 wider within than without; tho5e beyond, quadrangular, with 

 convex inner side, notched distal margin, and rounded distal angles; 

 wider than long, except basal one or two; not in contact, but sepa- 

 rated by a narrow space, where ventral ends of lateral arm plates 

 are wedged in. Arm spines five, on basal joints, but four in middle 

 part of arm, subequal or lower slightly longer, nearly equal to, or 

 a little longer than, corresponding arm joint; conical and obtuse on 

 proximal joints, but flattened distally; next to lowest spine especially 

 flattened and rather spur-shaped, with numerous thorns on its much 

 flattened tip; lowest spine (as well as second above it) also more 

 or less thorny at tip.

Tentacle pores large, without scales. Color in alcohol: disk 

 gray; radial shields and arms straw-yellow. 



Numerous specimens; Aburatsubo Cove: Misaki Marine Bio- 

 logical Station. 



A. cestuarii differs from the foregoing species, A. vadicola, in the 

 shape of the radial shields, in the much shorter arms, in the dorsal 

 arm plates, which are very wide even on the basal joints, and in the 

 fewer, less flattened arm spines. 



A. cestuarii together with A. euopla H. L. Clark are easily obtained 

 by dredging in the muddy bottom of Aburatsubo Cove. They 

 probably live buried in mud, as A. vadicola does in sand, and I 

 believe that, the reduced disk scales and the numerous thorny arm 

 spines are correlated with the mode of life.

HAPLOPHIURA gen. nov. 



Disk high, much elevated above arms, covered above with plates 

 'and scales, among which the primaries are very prominent, and 

 below with close-set, fine granules. Radial shields stout, joined 

 in pairs. Oral papillae soldered together. Genital plates and 

 scales present, but invisible in external view. Genital bursas absent 

 and genital slits invisible. Arms short, low, wider than high, covered 

 with convex arm plates. Tentacle pores, including second oral 

 ones, which open entirely outside oral slits, naked, being free from 

 scales. Arm spines few, minute. 



This new genus contains only a single species, Ophiozona gymno- 

 pora H. L. Clark. 



ASPIDOPHIURA gen. nov. 



Disk rather high, elevated above arms, flat, covered with very 

 stout primaries and radial shields, besides often a few smaller scales. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas covered by a very large plate, besides 

 very stout genital scales. Arm combs and genital papillae present. 

 Oral shields purse-shaped, with a beak-like inner process. Oral 

 papillae soldered together. Second oral tentacle pores open entirely 

 outside oral slits, slit-like, guarded by numerous small scales. Arms 

 rather short, strongly knotted, with long arm joints. Dorsal arm 

 plates very rudimentary or entirely absent. Ventral arm plates 

 small, rhomboidal or triangular. Tentacle pores present only on 

 several proximal arm joints, provided with few or no scales. Three 

 short, conical arm spines.

Aspidophiura watasei sp. nov. It stands rather between Antho- 

 phiura and a certain group of Amphiophiura with very conspicuous 

 ventral interbrachial plates. 



Aspidophiura watasei sp. nov. 



This species is very near A. Jorhesi, but differs from it chieflj' in 

 the presence of a central boss to each of the six primary plates, in 

 the smaller radial shields, whifch are about as large as the radial 

 plates, in the ventral arm plates, which more rapidly diminish in 

 size outwards, in the longer arm spines, which are longer than half 

 the corresponding arm joint, and in the absence of tentacle scales 

 beyond the disk. 



The present species differs from A. minuta chiefl}^ in the presence 

 of a central boss to each of the six primaries, in the smaller radial 

 shields and in the better-developed arm combs. 



The type specimen is 5 mm. across the disk with arms probably 

 about twice the disk diameter, and 1.3 mm. in width. Color in 

 alcohol: disk yellowish gray above and white below; arms white. 



One specimen; Sagami Sea. One specimen; Uraga Channel. 



AMPHIOPHIURA gen. nov. 



Disk high, often convex, covered with plates and scales, among 

 which the primaries are very prominent. Radial shields stout, 

 joined in pairs. Arm combs and genital papillae present. Oral 

 shields oval, pyriform or trefoil. Second oral tentacle pores open 

 more or less, or entirely, outside oral slits; large, guarded by numerous 

 scales. Arms moderately long, gradually tapering outwards, with 

 blunt tips. Dorsal and ventral arm plates fairly well developed; 

 successive plates in contact with each other at least on proximal 

 arm joints. Lateral arm plates high, with few to numerous short, 

 peg-like arm spines. Tentacle pores large, with numerous scales. 



This new genus includes Ophioglijpha bullata Wyville Thomson, 

 which is here designated as the genotype; also the following species 

 with very conspicuous oral shields, which almost cover the ventral 

 interbrachial areas, 0. convexa Lyman and 0. insoUta, improba, and 

 ahclita, of Koehler; also the following species with very conspicuous 

 ventral interbrachial plates, 0. solida and scutata of Lyman, 0. 

 stellata Stucler, 0. paupera, sordida, liberata, urbana, remota, and 

 latro of Koehler, and Ophiura cediplax and pompophora of H. L.

 many scales, and having axe-shaped ventral arm plates, Ophio- 

 glypha radiata and ornata of Lyman, and 0. abcisa and ohtecta of 

 Llitken and Mortensen. 



The group with very large oral shields or with very conspicuous 

 ventral interbrachial plates approaches Ophiopyrgus on the one 

 hand and Aspidophiura on the other; the group with ventral inter- 

 brachial areas covered with many scales and with quadrangular 

 ventral arm plates approaches Gymnophiura on the one hand and 

 Stegophiura (vide infra) on the other; and the group with ventral 

 interbrachial areas covered with many scales, and with axe-shaped

GYMNOPHIURA Liitken and Mortensen, 1899 (restr.). 



Disk high, covered by a naked skin. Radial shields long, narrow, 

 bar-like, widely separated from each other, covered by skin. Arm 

 combs and genital papillae present. Oral shields comparatively 

 small, pentagonal, with notched lateral sides. Second oral tentacle 

 pores opened partially outside the oral slits, large, with numerous 

 scales. Arms moderately long, very gradually tapered outwards, 

 with blunt extremity. Dorsal and ventral arm plates well developed, 

 successive plates widely in contact with each other. Lateral arni 

 plates high, with numerous minute, peg-like arm spines. Tentacle 

 pores large, with numerous scales. 



This genus, as restricted, contains but a single species, G. tnollis 

 Liitken and Mortensen. Another species, viz., G. coerulescens, is, 

 in my opinion, referable to genuine Ophiura, and is probably con- 

 specific with, or at least closely allied to, Ophiura flagellata (Lyman). 



Gymnophiura is very near Amphiophiura, especially the group 

 with ventral interbrachial areas covered with many scales, and with 

 quadrangular ventral arm plates, but differs from it in the naked 

 disk and in the radial shields, which are narrow, bar-like, skin-covered 

 and widely separated from each other. 



STEGOPHIURA gen. nov. 



Disk high, covered with plates and scales, among which the 

 primaries are prominent. Radial shields stout, joined distally. 

 Arm combs and genital papillae present. Oral shields oval or pyri-

outside oral slits, large, provided with numerous scales. Arms very 

 short, very stout at base, higher than wide, rapidly tapering distally, 

 with acute tip. Dorsal and ventral arm 'plates well developed, 

 successive plates widely in contact with each other. Lateral arm 

 plates high, with numerous arm spines, often unequal and arranged 

 in two series. Tentacle pores large, with numerous scales. 



This genus includes Ophiura nodosa and stiiwitzii of Llitken, Ophio- 

 glypha elevata Lyman, 0. sculpta, sladeni (= Ophiura stiphra H. L. 

 Clark), and striata of Duncan, and 0. sterea and Ophiura brachyactis 

 of H. L. Clark, besides a new species, Stegophiura vivipara. 



The genotype is Ophiura nodosa Ltk. Stegophiura much resembles 

 a certain group of Amphiophiura, but differs in the shorter, stouter 

 and more rapidly tapering arms with more acute tips. 

 Stegophiura vivipara sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 6 mm. Length of arms 13 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 mm. Disk pentagonal, or circular (especially 

 when the animal contains many embryos), convex, covered with 

 fifty to sixty plates on the dorsal side, including the radial shields. 

 Central plate pentagonal. Five pentagonal radials, directly surround- 

 ing the central plate, laterally overlapping each other. In each 

 interradial space of dorsal side is a large squarish plate, wider than 

 long, in contact with radial shields; latter irregular in outline, about 

 as wide as long, one overlapping the other, instead of apposed to 

 each other in radial line. On ventral side of disk plates rounded 

 and knob-like, with furrows between. Genital papillae blunt, close- 

 set, longer outwards and upwards, where they form small arm combs. 

 Oral shields pear-shaped, much longer than wide, wider without 

 than within, with acute inner angles and perfectly rounded distal 

 margins. Adoral shields large, meeting within along their whole 

 length. Five oral papillae on either wide, squarish, short, wide, 

 close-set; a pair of infradental papillae at apex of each jaw, much 

 longer and stouter than the other oral papillae, rather obtusely 

 pointed. Five teeth, very small, close-set, obtusely pointed. Arms 

 very short, stout at base, rapidly tapered distally. Dorsal arm 

 plates fan-shaped, about as wide as long, convex dorsally. Lateral 

 arm plates convex, those of the two sides separated both above and 

 below on the basal arm joints. First ventral arm plate large, tri- 

 angular, with obtuse inner angle and convex outer side, wider than 

 long; the following plates are octagonal, with very short proximo- 

 lateral and disto-lateral sides, the former concave at tentacle pores; 

 wider than long, wider without than within; from the six or seventh

outwards, the plates are longer than wide, hexagonal, with very 

 short proximal and proximo-lateral sides, concave lateral margins 

 and a very convex distal side. Arm spines seven or eight, including 

 the tentacle scales, on the free basal joints, fine, conical, short; 

 middle ones longer than upper and lower ones, and about half as 

 long as corresponding arm joint; diminishing in number outwards; 

 the lower spines are much finer and serve as tentacle scales. Second 

 oral tentacle pore, very large, opening outside oral slit, bounded by 

 three or four scales on each side. Tentacle pores large, guarded 

 on basal joints by one to three aboral scales, besides the lower arm 

 spines on the adoral side. Color in alcohol: pale gray.

 Sea, 75 and 100 fathoms. 



This species is viviparous. I once dissected out twenty-four 

 embryos of various sizes from a single adult. 



OPHIUROLEPIS gen. nov. 



Disk covered with larger rounded plates and smaller scales, the 

 former surrounded by belts of the latter. Radial shields moderately 

 large, rounded, separated from each other. Adoral shields oval, 

 with rounded inner border and obtusely pointed outer end. One 

 to three supplementary plates are present in each space between the 

 adoral shields and oral plates. Teeth and oral papillse present, the 

 latter very close set. Arm combs, as well as genital papillse, absent. 

 Arms long, stout, very gradually tapered. Dorsal arm plates very 

 well developed, widely in contact with each other. Lateral arm 

 plates low. Ventral arm plates triangular, nearly or scarcely in 

 contact with each other. Second oral tentacle pores open entirely 

 outside oral slits, long, slit-like, closed by tentacle scales, which 

 are modified so as to appear like supplementary plates. A single 

 arm spine and three tentacle scales, both being minute and peg-like. 



This new genus contains a single species, Ophiolepis carinata 

 Studer, 1876 ( = Ophioglypha deshayesi Lyman). 



Ophiurolepis is very peculiar in every feature, as it is certainly 

 not referable to Ophiura, even in a wide sense. The disk squamation

Disk low, flat, covered with plates and scales, among which the 

 primaries are usually very prominent. Radial shields usually

separated from each other, sometimes more or less joined in pairs. 

 Second oral tentacle pores open nearly or entirely outside oral slits, 

 very large, beset with numerous scales. Genital papillse, and usually 

 also arm combs, present. Arms low, often flattened. Dorsal arm 

 plates usually well developed and in contact with each other. Lateral 

 arm plates low, those of the two sides being in contact with each 

 other below. Three or more arm spines of variable length. Ten- 

 tacle pores of one or two innermost pairs large and beset with rather 

 numerous scales, but those beyond very small and beset with a few 

 scales. 



This genus, as here restricted, includes Asterias ciliata Retzius and 

 the following species with spiniform genital and comb-papillse : 

 Ophiura albida Forbes, Ophiolepis robusta Ayres, Ophiura sarsii, 

 ardica, carnea, and affinis of Llitken, 0. kinhergi Ljungman, 0.

Ophionotus, Ophioperla and Ophiotjalfa are very close to the 

 present genus — especially to the typical group with spiniform genital 

 and comb papillse and with rather long arm spines. Ophionotus 

 may be defined as typical Ophiura with supplementary dorsal arm 

 plates; Ophioperla as Ophiura with granulated disk; and Ophio- 

 tjalfa as Ophiura without genital papillae and arm combs.

OPHIOZONELLA gen. nov. 



Disk covered with stout plates, mingled with smaller ones. Radial 

 shields very large; those of both sides of a radius separated from 

 each other by a single row of plates, or more or less in contact with 

 each other. No distinct trio of plates just outside and between each 

 pair of radial shields. Oral and adoral shields rather large. Teeth 

 and oral papillae present; the latter are thick and close-set. Genital 

 slits short, not reaching disk margin. Arms not very long, stout 

 at base, rather rapidly tapering distally to a slender and acute tip. 

 Dorsal and ventral arm plates rhomboidal, successive plates separated 

 from each other, at least, distal to arm base. Arm spines two to 

 four, short. One or two tentacle scales to each pore. 



This new genus includes the following species with two tentacle 

 scales: Ophiozona nivea, tessellata, marmorea and clypeata of Lyman, 

 0. bispinosa and molesta of Koehler, and 0. elevata and platydisca 

 of H. L. Clark; and the following with only one tentacle scale: 

 0. insularia stellata, antillarum and depressa of Lyman, 0. alba and 

 contigua of Liitken and Mortensen, 0. casta and projeda of Koehler, 

 0. tjalfiana Mortensen, and 0. polyplax and longispina of H. L. 

 Clark. The genotype is Ophiozona longispina H. L. Clark. 



Ophiozonella includes deep-water forms and is allied to such genera 

 as Ophiocrates and Ophiofuidas, while genuine Ophiozona includes 

 littoral forms and is very close to Ophiolepis and Ophiothyreus. 



OPHIOZONA Lyman, 1865 (restr.). 



Disk covered with very numerous small plates and scales, the 

 larger surrounded by belts of smaller. Radial shields small, widely 

 separated from each other by several plates and numerous scales. 

 A noticeable trio of plates is distinguishable just outside and between 

 each pair of radial shields. Oral and adoral shields small. Teeth 

 and oral papillge present, latter very thick and close-set. Genital 

 slits rather long. Arms long, rather slender, very gradually tapering 

 distally, with blunt tips. Dorsal, as well as ventral, arm plates 

 well developed, quadrangular, successive plates widely in contact 

 with each other throughout the entire length of the arm. Four or 

 five short, peg-like arm spines. Two tentacle scales to each pore, 

 more or less oval in common outline. 



This genus, as here restricted, includes only Ophiolepis impressa 

 and pacifica of Liitken (the two species on which Ophiozona was 

 based by Lyman). The genotype is 0. impressa. 



The Ophiolepidinse comprises two groups, one of which includes 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 83 



genera with well-developed, quadrangular dorsal and ventral arm 

 plates and the other those with more or less rudimentary dorsal 

 and ventral arm plates. The first group, including littoral forms, 

 is again divided into two sections, one of which, including Ophio- 

 thyreus, Ophiozona and Ophiolepis, is characterized by the presence 

 of a distinct trio of plates just outside and between each pair of 

 radial shields and by the presence of two tentacle scales, which are 

 oval in common outline; while the other, including Ophioceramis 

 and Ophioplocus, is characterized by the absence of a distinct trio 

 of plates just outside and between each pair of radial shields, and 

 by the presence of three to five tentacle scales, which surround the 

 pore. The distinction of Ophiolepis and Ophiozona from each other 

 depends upon the presence or absence of supplementary dorsal arm 

 plates. From a certain point of view, I believe that Ophiozona is 

 more closely allied to Ophiolepis than to Ophiozonella. Ophiozona 

 is found in the West Indies and on the Pacific side of Panama. The 

 faunae of the two sides of Panama stand in a very intimate relation 

 to each other. The distribution of Ophiozona and that of Ophio- 

 derma are equally interesting as illustrating this truth.

Ophiolimna, emend., includes Ophiacantha hairdii Lyman (referred 

 to Ophiolimna by Verrill), Ophioconis antarctica Lyman, Ophia- 

 cantha perfida Koehler, Ophiolimna operculata Koehler, Ophioconis- 

 diastata and papillata of H. L. Clark and Ophiacantha lambda H. L. 

 Clark, and belongs to the Ophiacanthidse. Ophiuroconis includes 

 Ophioconis pulveridenta and miliaria of Lyman, besides the genotype, 

 Ophiuroconis monolepis sp. nov. Ophiurodon includes Ophioconis 

 cincta Brock, 0. grandisquaryia, permixta and cupida of Koehler. 

 Ophiurochceta includes Ophiochceta mixta Lyman (referred to Ophio- 

 limna by Verrill) and Ophiolimna littoralis Koehler. The last three 

 genera belong to the Ophiarachninae; especially Ophiurochceta is 

 very near Ophiarachna. Ophioconis, restr., includes Pectinura, 

 forbesii Heller (referred to Ophioconis by Llitken) and Ophioconis: 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 85 



brevispina Ludwig. Ophiochceta contains only 0. hirsuta Liitken. 

 Genuine Ophioconis much resembles Cryptopelta, but has, however, 

 hyaline arm spines. Genuine Ophiochceta appears to be very near 

 Pectinura, but is, however, covered with fine spines, instead of granules, 

 on the disk. " Ophioconis^ ^ indica Koehler, which I do not dare to 

 name generically, as I have not myself examined it, appears to 

 resemble Pectinura, except for the hyaline arm spines and the presence 

 of a single tentacle scale on most of the tentacle pores, instead of two. 



OPHIUROCONIS gen. nov. 



Disk and oral angles, including oral shields, closely covered with 

 fine granules. Six or seven oral papillae on either side of each jaw; 

 outermost one pointed inwards, stretching above next papilla, which 

 is the largest. Teeth triangular and obtusely pointed. Arms not 

 very long, cylindrical, widest at the base, tapering outwards to the 

 very slender tip, where the vertebrae are imperfectly divided into 

 halves by a longitudinal series of pores. Ventral arm plates wider 

 than long, not in contact with each other, except on the most proxi- 

 mal joints. Arm spines six or more, more or less long, flattened, 

 hyaline and not appressed. One or two tentacle scales to each pore. 



Ophiuroconis monolepis sp. nov. 



This species is at once distinguished from both 0. pulverulenta 

 and miliaria by fewer oral papillae, by fewer and shorter arm spines 

 and by the presence of a single tentacle scale, instead of two, to each 

 pore. Oral papillae, six or seven in number on either side of each 

 jaw, close-set and acute. Each lateral arm plate bears six or seven 

 arm spines, which are rather spiniform, acute, slightly flattened 

 and hyaline; uppermost one or two spines nearly twice as long as, 

 and lowest one slightly shorter than, corresponding arm joint. A 

 single small, leaf-like, but acutely pointed, tentacle scale at each 

 pore. Dorsal arm plates, rather small, fan-shaped, not in contact 

 with each other, wider than long, convex along median line, so that 

 the arm is keeled dorsallj^ as a whole. Ventral arm plates, very 

 small, much wider than long, much shorter than corresponding arm 

 joint. All the dorsal, lateral and ventral arm plates are concen- 

 trically striated. 



The type specimen is 5 mm. across disk, 25 mm. in arm length and 

 1 mm. in arm width at base. Color in alcohol : light yellow. 



Six specimens; Sagami Sea, 85 fathoms. Two specimens; Sagami 

 Sea, 300 fathoms. 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



OPHIURODON gen. nov. 



Disk and oral angles, including oral^shields, closely covered with 

 fine granules. Four or five oral papillae on either side of each jaw; 

 outermost pointed inwards, stretching above next papilla. Teeth 

 flat, thin, with widened and often serrate end. Arms not very long, 

 widest at base, tapering outwards to the very slender tip. Ventral 

 arm plates very narrow, longer than wide, distinctly in contact with 

 each other. Vertebrae of distal arm joints often imperfectly divided 

 into halves by a longitudinal series of pores. Six or more arm 

 spines, long, flattened, hyahne, not appressed. Single tentacle scale 

 to each pore. 



The genotype is Ophioconis grandisquama Koehler, and it is worth 

 noting that a specimen of this species was recently collected at 

 Okinose (a submarine bank), in the Sagami Sea. 



OPHIUROCH^TA gen. nov. 



Disk closely covered with fine granules and sparsely beset 7.'ith 

 fine spines. Oral angles also granulated, but oral shields naked. 

 Numerous close-set oral papillae, of which outermost one is pointed 

 inwards, stretching above next papilla, which is the largest. Teeth 

 triangular and obtusely pointed. Arms not very long, rather stout, 

 stoutest at base. Dorsal, as well as ventral, arm plates well devel- 

 oped, widely in contact with each other. Six or more arm spines, 

 long, flagellate, opaque, not appressed. Two tentacle scales to each 

 pore, abraclial one overlapping base of lowest arm spine. 



The genotype is Ophiochceta mixta Lyman. 



Ophiurochceta differs from Ophiolimna in the following important 

 particulars: more numerous oral papillae, of which the outermost 

 one is not operculiform, but pointed inwards above the next papilla, 

 which is the largest; well-developed dorsal and ventral arm plates, 

 which are widely in contact with each other, two tentacle scales, 

 of which the abradial one distinctly overlaps the base of the lowest 

 arm spine; triple peristomal plates. Verrill considers that the 

 internal structures of 0. mixta are much like those of Ophiacantha; 

 but my own opinion is quite to the contrary. 



I have observed that the internal structures of Ophiuroconis 

 monolepis, Ophiurodon grandisquama, Ophiurochceta mixta, Ophi- 

 arachna incrassata, Ophiochiton fastigatus, Ophioplax lamellosa, etc., 

 belong to a common type. In them the peristomal plates are always 

 triple, consisting of two paired and one median secondary jDlates; 

 while in Ophiacantha, Ophiolimna, etc., the peristomal plates are 




1915. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



entire, or double with soldered halves, and always lack a third, 

 median secondary plate. Further, the peristomal plates of the 

 former type are distinctly longer in proportion to their width than 

 are those of the latter. 



Ignoring the smaller size, Ophiurocfueta much resembles Ophi- 

 arachna, the only essential differences being the presence of scattered 

 disk spines and the absence of accessory oral shields. The systematic 

 value of the accessory oral shields is, however, considered insignificant 

 by Dr. H. L. Clark. I have also observed the absence of the acces- 

 sory oral shields in some interradii of a specimen of Ophiarachna 

 incrassata. One may safely say, then, that the relation of Ophiu- 

 rochceta to Ophiarachna is parallel to that of Ophiomastiz to Ophio- 

 coma or of Ophiochceta to Pectinura. 



Subfamily 2. OPHIODERMATIN.E nov.

This subfamily includes Ophioconis, restr., Cryptopelta, Bathy- 

 pedinura, Pectinura, Ophiopezella, Ophiochceta, Ophiarachnella, Ophio- 

 chasma, Ophioderma, Ophioncus and Diopederma. 

 Bathypectinura gotoi sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 50 mm. Length of arms 195 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 7 mm. Disk pentagonal, flat, closely covered with 

 fine granules, of which four or five are contained in 1 mm. Radial 

 shields only partly naked, but distinguishal^le through the super- 

 ficial granulations, by the slight swelling, as large, elongated ovate 

 plates, nearly half as long as disk radius, wider outwards; naked 

 part very small, ovate, and wider without than within. Genital 

 slits very long, almost reaching disk margin. Genital plates visible 

 from exterior, lying along adradial border of slits, long, very stout. 



Oral shields small, triangular, with rounded angles and convex 

 sides, nearly as wide as long. Accessory oral shields very rudiment- 

 ary; in one of the two specimens they are absent, but in the 

 other they are indistinctly represented by one or two small scales, 

 which are separated from the oral shield by granules. The adoral 

 shields are almost, and the oral plates entirely, covered with granules, 

 which are coarser and sparser than distally. Eight or nine oral 

 papillse on either side; outermost two or three large, flat, thin, outer 

 second largest; inner ones small, more or less conical, obtuse. Five 

 to seven teeth, irregular in shape and size, with pointed or rounded 

 ends, arranged in an irregular vertical row. 



Arms long, stout, gradually tapered outwards, with a rather sharp

dorsal median ridge, triangular in transverse section. Dorsal arm 

 plates large, occupying almost entire dorsal surface of arm, quad- 

 rangular, with rounded outer corners, a little wider without than 

 within, three to four times as wide as long, with a rather sharp ridge 

 on the median line; some are divided into several irregular secondary 

 plates. Lateral arm plates very low, less than half height of arm, 

 meeting neither above nor below. Ventral arm plates small, rhom- 

 boidal, with shorter diameter parallel to arm axis. First plate 

 almost as wide as, but much shorter than, following; the three or 

 four plates beginning with the second have a median keel, which is 

 more prominent proximally both with regard to each plate and to 

 the arm as a whole. Arm spines four for the most part, but three 

 distally, very short, flattened, lanceolate, obtuse, lowest one some- 

 what longer than the others, but not so long as corresponding 

 arm joint. One tentacle scale, large, oval, thin, flat. Color in 

 alcohol: light yellowish brown. 



Two specimens; Sagami Sea, 170 fathoms. 



This new species is very near B. lacerlosa (Lyman), but differs 

 from it in the coarser disk granules, in the smaller naked part of the 

 radial shields, in the more strongly ridged dorsal arm plates, in the 

 much lower lateral arm plates, in the wider and rhomboidal ventral 

 arm plates, and in the shorter arm spines.

reducta Koehler (referred to Bathypectinura by Dr. H. L. Clark) .^ 

 It is, however, distinguished from 0. Ijungmani by the presence of 

 primary disk plates, by coarser disk scales, by shape of radial shields, 

 by the disk margin being not so closely granulated, and by the shape 

 of the oral shields; from 0. custos by the presence of primary disk 

 plates, by coarser disk scales, by the shape of the radial shields, by 

 the adoral shields not meeting each other within, by the shape of 

 the first and second ventral arm plates, by the presenc3 of lamellar 

 plates at the arm bases, and by shape of dorsal arm plates; and 

 from 0. reducta by dorsal side of disk being free of granules, by 

 radial shields not being divergent, and by shape of ventral arm plates. 

 Disk covered with fine, imbricating scales, among which the six 

 primaries are more or less distinct; the radial plates are smaller and 

 less conspicuous than the central plate. Radial shields triangular, 

 with acute inner angles, twice as long as wide; those of a pair are 

 nearly parallel, being separated from each other. Ventral inter- 

 brachial areas are closely covered with very fine granules. Oral 

 shields large, triangular, with strongly curved outer border, less 

 curved lateral sides, obtuse inner angle and perfectly rounded lateral 

 angles. Adoral shields large, triangular, long, tapered within to an 

 acute point, but they do not meet. Lamellar plates and fine granules 

 occur on dorsal and lateral surface of free arm bases. Dorsal arm 

 plates triangular at first, but soon becoming quadrangular with 

 rounded outer corners and curved lateral borders", much wider 

 without than within. First ventral arm plate is small, triangular, 

 with rounded -angles, nearly as wide as long; those beyond are 

 pentagonal, with an inwardly directed angle, which is covered by 

 the preceding plate; outer border curved, and lateral borders con- 

 cave and bounded by tentacle pores. A single large, oval tentacle 

 scale occurs on the abradial side of each pore; besides, on the adradial 

 side of a few basal pores, there are present one or two rudimentary 

 tentacle scales, more or less covered over by the abradial one. 



The type is 4.5 mm. across the disk, 35 mm. in arm length and 0.8 

 mm. in arm width at base. Color in alcohol: yellowish gray above 

 and white below; arms banded with dark gray. 



One specimen; off Kotsujima, Sagami Sea. 



It is recorded that the above specimen was taken with a coral -net, 



' Ophiopeza reducta appears to me to be referable to Ophioplax. The presence 

 of only three long, cylindrical arm spines and of only five oral papillae, the annu- 

 lation on the arms and the naked oral plates are all characters of Ophioplax, 

 but not of genuine Bathypectinura.

but the depth is not stated. As the annulation on the arms indicates^ 

 this species is not a deep-water form, but probably subUttoral. 



Subfamily 2. OPHIONEREIDIN^ Ljungman, 1867 (emend.). 

 (Characters as given in key, p. 88.) 

 Tliis subfamily includes Ophiodoris, Opkionereis and Ophiocrasis. 



OPHIOCRASIS H. L. Clark, 1911. 



Aside from the presence of the secondary supplementary dorsal 

 arm plates, this genus seems to me to be distinguished from Opkio- 

 nereis principally by negative characters and different degrees of 

 development of certain common structures. Disk scales even and 

 exceecUngly fine; no trace of marginal row of special disk scales; 

 no genital papillae; arms much more slender than in Opkionereis. 

 Schizogonic reproduction may not be a generic character.

 "Ophionereis porreda Marktanner, " Koehler, Bull. Sci. Fr. Belg., XXXI, 



1898, p. 76. 



Diameter of disk 9 mm. Length of arms 68 mm. Width of 

 arms, at base 1.2 mm, at the widest part 1.5 mm. Disk circular, 

 slightly concave, rather soft, covered with fine imbricating scales, 

 which are rather obscured, so that the disk appears as though covered 

 by a thick skin. Radial shields very small, short, exceedingly 

 narrow, tapered within, widely separated from each other, hard to 

 detect. Ventral interbrachial areas covered with scales similar to 

 those of the dorsal side, but even more obscure. Genital slits large, 

 nearly reaching disk margin. No genital papilla?. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, with obtuse inner angle and rounded 

 lateral and outer angles, nearly as wide as long, except madreporic 

 shield, which is decidedly longer than wide. Adoral shields small, 

 acutely tapered within, where they nearly or hardly meet. Four 

 or five oral papillae on either side of each jaw, unequal, short, rounded, 

 but the outermost one, which is closely associated with the second 

 oral tentacle pore, has pointed inner end. Four teeth, short, stout, 

 with wide end. 



Arms long and very slender, narrowed at base, widest at one- 

 fourth to one-third of arm length. Dorsal arm plates mostly tri- 

 angular, with obtuse outwardly directed apex, rather small, wider 

 than long, successive plates slightly in contact with each other; 

 quadrangular in the more distal parts. On either side of each dorsal 

 arm plate there occurs a large supplementary plate, which is nearly 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



semicircular, about one-half as large as the dorsal arm plate, and 

 bounded along the distal border by one or two very insignificant 

 secondary supplementary plates, which, however, are present only 

 for a comparatively short distance near the arm base; two or three 

 first dorsal arm plates and their supplementary plates are smaller 

 than those beyond; supplementary plates smaller outwards as 

 dorsal arm plates become quadrangular, and finally disappear. 

 Lateral arm plates not very prominent, meeting neither above nor 

 below. First ventral arm plate very small, rather pentagonal, 

 longer than wide; those beyond, quadrangular, with rounded outer 

 lateral angles, truncated inner lateral angles and slightly notched 

 outer border, nearly as long as wide, but longer than wide distally. 

 Three arm spines, short, stout, flattened, blunt. One large, oval 

 tentacle scale to each pore. Color in alcohol: grayish yellow; disk 

 reticulated, and arms banded, with dark purplish brown. 



Three specimens; Enoshima. Numerous specimens; Aral Beach, 

 Misaki Marine Biological Station.. 



The arm length varies from six to eight times the disk diameter. 

 In smaller specimens the arm spines are less flattened; and in those 

 smaller than 4 mm. across the disk the secondary supplementary 

 dorsal arm plates are 'almost invisible. 



This species differs from the genotype, 0. dictydisca H. L. Clark, 

 in the shape of the dorsal arm plates, in the less distinct secondary 

 supplementary dorsal arm plates and in the smaller and more insig- 

 nificant radial shields. Further, schizogonic reproduction has not 

 been observed in the present species, though I have examined many 

 very small specimens. 0. marklanneri, as well as the genotype, 

 resembles Ophionereis dubia in lacking the genital papillae, but 

 differs from it chiefly in the presence of the secondary supplementary 

 dorsal arm plates and in the much narrower arms. 0. marktanneri 

 is by no means near Ophionereis porrecta Lyman. I could mention 

 some more differences than those enumerated by Koehler between 

 these two species, but it is not necessary to do so here. 



This charmingly handsome species is one of the most common 

 ophiurans about Misaki, living under stones and rocks.

 two tentacle scales, of which the abradial one is minute and 

 acute, and the adradial one is very long and lanceolate, 



Ophiopsilin^. 



Subfamily 1. OPHIOCOMIN^ nov. 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiopteris, Ophiocoma, Ophiomastix and 

 Ophiar thrum. 



Subfamily 2. OPHIOPSILIN.E nov. 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily is formed by a single genus, Ophiopsila. 



Though Ophiopsila is referred to the Amphiuridse by certain 

 authors, it fundamentally differs from the latter in the internal 

 structures. The oral frames have well-developed lateral wings, as 

 in the Amphiuridse, Ophiotrichidse, Ophioceramis, Ophionereidinse 

 and Ophiocominse. The oral and dental plates are 7t -shaped (instead 

 of being x-shaped) in common outline in internal view, quite as in 

 Ophioceramis, the Ophionereidinse and Ophiocominse. The genital 

 plates are entirely free from the basal vertebrae and have two condyles 

 and one pit at the outer end to match two condyles and one pit of 

 the radial shield, as an important characteristic of the Chilophiurida; 

 while those of the Amphiuridse and Ophiotrichidse are firmly fixed 

 to the basal vertebrse and have only a single large condyle to match 

 one large socket of the radial shield. The genital scales are long, 

 narrow and bar-like, also a characteristic of the Chilophiurida; 

 while those of the Gnathophiurida are short, very flat and leaf-like. 

 As to the external characters, the presence of both oral and well- 

 developed dental papillae hinders any reference of Ophiopsila to 

 either the Amphiuridse or Ophiotrichidae. In short, Ophiopsila is 

 referal)le only to the Ophiocomidae, being, however, distinguished 

 from the other genera of that family by certain characters of second- 

 ary importance.

 differences in germ cell organization and characters of the body, 

 illustrated by representatives of groups or families of Orthoptera. 



The Recording Secretary read the following communication from 

 Adele M. Fielde: 



A new hypothesis concerning butterflies. — It is known that a virgin 

 female moth or butterfly of the Great Peacock, the Oak Egger, and 

 some other species attracts males of her kind from afar. 



No naturalist has written of this matter more charmingly than 

 has Jean Henri Fabre.^ Having sequestered such a female under a 

 wire-gauze cover, scores of males came from woodsy distances to 

 seek her. Putting her in an air-tight cell, whether of paper, wood, 

 glass, metal or cotton batting prevented the escape of her effluvium 

 and therefore prevented the arrival of her suitors. If placed under 

 a bell glass, where' she was plainly visible to the oncoming swarm 

 of males, they ignored her and settled upon a twig, a chair-bottom, 

 a bit of flannel, or a few dry leaves where she had reposed and affixed 

 her subtile aroma. Even smooth, clean surfaces retained her 

 emanation after contact with her and lured the male in her absence. 



Neither strong stenches made by napthaline, tobacco, or sul-

phuretted hydrogen, nor penetrating perfumes exhaled by spike- 

 lavender, diffused through the laboratory, prevented the flocking of 

 males to the wire-gauze cage of the female. 



The removal of the antennae of the males did not settle the question 

 whether these organs were noses. A sick and sore insect cannot be 

 depended upon for the solution of problems. None of the maimed 

 males lived more than a day or two after the surgical operation. 

 Their natural span of life was too short for the recovery of normal 

 health necessary to physiological experimentation. 



In my work upon the antenna of the ant I found that this organ 

 is a compound nose, every segment being a sub-nose capable of 

 discerning a certain odor while insensitive to all other odors.- If 

 the antennae of moths and butterflies be constructed on the same 

 plan as are the antennae of the ants, each sub-nose having power 

 to discern a particular otlor, then it may be that certain species of 

 moths and butterflies possess, while other species lack, the sub-nose 

 that perceives the effluvium of the adolescent female, whose ephemeral 

 existence makes early mating necessary to the continuance of the 

 tribe. 



The result of the elision of the whole of both antennae would not 

 reveal the answer to the question concerning a sub-nose. Surgery 

 would needs be applied, segment by segment, until the sub-nose 

 discerning the female effluvium should be discovered through abnor- 

 mal behavior produced by no other cause than the elimination of 

 that particular segment. One species having antennae might possess 

 this sub-nose, while another species having antennae might lack 

 this sub-nose, and in this difference in the line or series of sub-noses 

 would lie the cause of unlike behavior in species apparently endowed 

 with similar organs of smell. 



A curious and unexplained instinct in insects generally impels 

 them to deposit their eggs upon substances that are the natural food 

 of the larvae hatched from the eggs. Since the mature insect does 

 not eat the sort of food upon which the larvae subsist and grow, and 

 since the pupa-stage, in some cases continuing many months, inter- 

 venes between the larval period and the emergence in mature form, 

 it seems improbable that memory of the gustatory joys of her own 

 larval existence or an intelligent foresight in provision for her 

 young is what induces the mother insect to deposit her eggs on the 

 nutriment required by the larvae issuing therefrom. The possession 

 of an olfactory organ, a sub-nose discerning the chemical constituents 

 of the nourishment ingested in her own earliest days, may account 

 for the habitual behavior of the insect in choosing to deposit her 

 eggs in a place that will favor the continuance of her tribe. 



The tiny truffle hunting beetle, Balhoceras gallicus,^ infallibly 

 reaching its sole food by digging a vertical tunnel of from twelve to

fifteen inches from the surface of the ground to its subterranean 

 sustenance, probably has a sub-nose that smeUs nothing save the 

 fungus whose odor emanates from the sandy soiL 



There is great significance in tlie fact that spiders and scorpions, 

 having no practical use for the sense of smell in their habitual activi- 

 ties, have no antennae. 



Summary. — If moths and butterflies, like certain ants, have a 

 compound nose, then one of the sub-noses guiding the habitual 

 activities of the male insect may function exclusively in cUscerning 

 the odor of the adolescent female. Elision of the whole antennae 

 would then prevent, as it possibly did in the case of Fabre's Oak 

 Eggers, a return under the allurement offered by the female. 



Moths and butterflies normall}- lacking such a sub-nose would 

 not be subject to this particular lure, although the antennae Avere 

 intact. 



This hypothesis fits the phenomena and explains what has here- 

 tofore been considered mysterious.

FIXATION OF SINGLE TYPE (LECTOTYPIC) SPECIMENS OF SPECIES OF 



AMERICAN ORTHOPTERA. 



DIVISION III. 

 BY ALBERT P. MORSE AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



Species of North American Orthoptera Described 

 BY Albert Pitts Morse. 



The desirability of selection and fixation of a single type has been 

 discussed and such work accomplished for a large number of species 

 of North American Orthoptera in the first paper bearing the title 

 here used by James A. G. Rehn and the present junior author.^ 

 The species of North American Orthoptera described by A. N. 

 Caudell have been treated in similar manner in the second division 

 of the series by their sponsor and the present junior author, ^ and in 

 this paper the species described from North America by the present 

 senior author, whether valid or established synonyms, are similarly 

 treated. 



It has been a rule with the senior author to consider every specimen 

 of the series originally described as a type, but the selection from 

 these of the single type by their author obviates all difficulties which 

 might otherwise have arisen. 



In the present paper, North America is used in its restricted sense, 

 only including that part of the continent north of the Mexican line, 

 as has been done in the_ other papers of the series, except in particular 

 instances in the first division, where, in order to make certain of the 

 sections complete, it was found necessary to include all of the species 

 described in papers treating of North America south to the Isthmus 

 of Panama. 



Of the sixty-five units here considered the types of fifty-two are 

 in the Morse Collection,^ ten in the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoology and one each in the American Museum of Natural History, 

 Cornell University and Hebard Collection.

a biological reconnaissance of the okefinokee swamp 



in georgia. 



Prefatory. 



During the summer of 1912 a party of zoologists, all froni Cornell 

 University, visited the Okefinokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, 

 remaining seven weeks in the early summer (May 28 to July 13). 

 The party consisted of Professors C. R. Crosby and J. Chester 

 Bradley, of the Department of Entomology; Dr. A. H. Wright, of 

 the Department of Zoology; Headmaster W. D. Funkhouser, of the 

 Ithaca High School; Messrs. M. D. Leonard, S. C. Bishop and A. R. 

 Cahn, of the class of 1913, and Paul Battle, of Bainbridge, Ga. 

 Mr. E. I.. Worsham, State Entomologist of Georgia, and Mr. Charles 

 S. Spooner, Assistant State Entomologist, were with the party for 

 a week. A smaller part}' from the same institution spent two 

 weeks in the swamp in December, 1913 (December 18, 1913, to 

 January 1, 1914). This party consisted of Professors James G. 

 Needham and J. Chester Bradley, John T. Needham and Paul 

 Battle. In addition. Dr. Bradley and Mr. Battle spent a week in 

 the swamp in September, 1913, and Dr. Bradley had made very 

 brief trips into the swamp in the fall of 1909 and the spring of 1911. 



The object of all these expeditions was to study and put on record 

 something of the biological conditions in this extensive fresh-water 

 swamp, which still presents in a large measure primitive and inter- 

 esting conditions of environment, before they should become forever 

 changed by the now rapidly penetrating lumbermen. 



Under the above title it is intended to publish reports upon the 

 various groups collected, as studied. In due course a general account 

 of the ecological and environmental features will be published. A 

 report upon the birds, by Dr. Albert H. Wright and F. Harper, 

 has appeared in The Auk, 1913, 4 : 477-505, PI. XIV-XX. This 

 contains brief descriptions of the various "habitats" of the swamp. 



In the reports on the various groups, observations made and 

 specimens collected during the summer of 1912 will be credited to 

 the "Cornell University Expedition," abbreviated "C. U. Exp." 

 This does not imply that the university had any official connection 

 with the work. Each member of the party went on his own initiative 

 and at his own expense.

THE REPTILES. 



I. TURTLES, LIZARDS, AND ALLIGATOR. 



BY ALBERT H. WRIGHT AND W. D. FUNKHOUSER. 



Although the Okefinokee Swamp represents one of the most 

 interesting regions in the southeastern United States for the study 

 of reptihan hfe, practically no records have been made of this part 

 of its fauna. The following paper is intended as a preliminary 

 contribution toward a knowledge of the herpetology of this area — 

 an area which is sure to prove a rich field for zoological work when 

 suitable provision has been made to render its interior more accessible. 



Few attempts have been made to enter the Okefinokee for scientific 

 purposes. The swamp, in its earlier history, was a centre for beau- 

 tiful Indian legends and mythical tales; in later times, this pathless 

 wilderness occasioned a weird medley of stories, many of which 

 reflect its supposedly dangerous attributes. The miasmatic effect 

 of the "black mud, the stench from which soon became so intoler- 

 able as to induce vomiting," impresses Captain Rodenbough (1838)^ 

 as its worst characteristic; while another considers it " very dangerous 

 to the health of man especially to recent arrivals in the country; 

 .... in the Okefinokee mosquitoes sometimes rise in such swarms 

 that the trees are only seen dimly as through a dust-storm." But 

 with natives and travellers alike, a deterrent more powerful than 

 either of these behefs are the dreaded reptiles within its borders. 

 Paul Fountain,- in his A Day in a Cypress Swamp (Okefinokee), 

 devotes practically his entire chapter to these cold-blooded creatures. 

 He says: "A greater number of reptiles may be found in this 

 swamp than in any other spot I know of in the States," and our 

 experience proves it a veritable paradise for the herpetologist. 



Professor A. M. Reese,^ when searching for clues to the breeding 

 habits of the alligator, made a trip to the Okefinokee in the summer 

 of 1905. He says: 



"In the summer of 1906 the Okefinokee was again visited; this time the 

 swamp was penetrated to its centre, and nearly one hundred alHgators were 

 killed by the three hunters with whom I was travelling. It is this vigorous 

 hunting, done chiefly at night, with a bull's-eye lantern and shot-gun, that has 

 so diminished the number of alligators, where, twenty years ago, hundreds

could be seen, to-day scarcely one may be found. It seems a very wanton 

 destruction of life to kill so many of these large animals, especially when it is 

 remembered that a large alligator hide is worth to the hunter only about $1.50." 

 "Just how soon (if at all) the alligator is likely to be exterminated in our 

 Southern States it is impossible to say, but so long as those two great swampy 

 wastes, the Everglades and the Okefinokee, remain undrained, the great American 

 reptile is not hkely to become entirelj- extinct." 



Of this same form we have the very interesting account of Andrew 

 EUicott,"* who served as the United States Commissioner to determine 

 the boundary between Florida and Georgia in 1800. With tlie 

 Spanish Commissioner, he started up the St. Mary's January 23, 

 and returned March 3; and his mounds "A" and "B" have been 

 the subject of many memorials by both Florida and Georgia. He 

 writes : 



"This being the season that the Alligators, or American crocodiles were be- 

 ginning to crawl out of the mud and bask in the sun, it was a favorable time to 

 take them, both on account of their torpid state, and to examine the truth of the 

 report of their swallowing pine knots in the fall of the year to serve them, (on 

 account of their difficult digestion) during the term of their torpor, which is 

 probably about three months. For this purpose two Alligators of about eight 

 or nine feet in length were taken and opened, and in the stomach of each were 

 found several pine and other knots, pieces of bark, and in one of them some 

 charcoal; but exclusive of such indigestible matter, the stomachs of both were 

 empty. So far the report appears to be founded in fact; but whether these were 

 swallowed on account of their tedious digestion, and therefore proper during the 

 time those animals lay in the mud, or to prevent the collapse of the coats of the 

 stomach, or by accident owing to their voracious manner of devouring their 

 food, is difficult to determine. 



"The Alfigator has been so often, and so well described, and those descriptions 

 are so well known, that other attempts have become unnecessary. It may 

 nevertheless be proper to remark that so far as the human species are concerned, 

 the Alligators appear much le-is dangerous than has generally been supposed, 

 particularly by those unacquainted with them. And I do not recollect meeting 

 with but one well authenticated fact of any of the human species being injured 

 by them in that country, (where they are very numerous,) and that was a negro 

 near New Orleans, who while standing in the water sawing a piece of timber, had 

 one of his legs dangerously wounded by one of them. My opinion on this sub- 

 ject is founded on my own experience. I have frequently been a witness to 

 Indians, including men, women and children, bathing in rivers and ponds, where 

 those animals are extremely numerous, without any apparent dread or caution: 

 the same practice was pursued by myself and people, without caution, and 

 without injiuy. 



"Some of the Alligators we killed were very fat, and would doubtless have 

 yielded a considerable quantity of oil, which is probably almost the only use that 

 will ever be made of them; however their tails are frequently eaten by the Indians 

 and negroes, and Mr. Bowles informed me that he thought them one of the 

 greatest of delicacies. 



"The. Alligators appear to abound plentifully in musk, the smell of which is 

 sometimes perceptible to a considerable distance, when they are wounded or 

 killed; but whether the musk is contained in a receptacle for that purpose, and 

 secreted by a particular gland or glands, or generally diffused through the system 

 appears somewhat uncertain: and I confe.ss their appearance was so disagreeable 

 and offensive to me, that I felt no inclination to undertake the dissection of one 

 •of them."

The bulk of the material described in the present paper was 

 obtained by the expedition from Cornell University during the 

 summer of 1912, at which time the swamp was entered from the 

 southwestern side and a permanent camp established on Billy's 

 Island, located in the centre of the swamp. From this camp 

 side trips were made from time to time throughout the summer, 

 and a fairly accurate idea of the geography and biology of the region 

 was obtained. 



Most valuable services were rendered to this party by the Lee 

 family, living on Billy's Island, the only human inhabitants of the 

 interior of the swamp, and practically out of touch with the outside 

 world. Their primitive mode of living had adapted them to a 

 marvellous degree to the appreciation of the wild life about them, 

 and their observations and knowledge of natural phenomena proved 

 to be surprisingly accurate. The older men and boys were indis- 

 pensable as guides while the party was in the swamp, and on the 

 exit of the party a container was left with them to be filled with 

 specimens which might come to their hands later in the year. This 

 container, full of material chosen with evident care and good judg- 

 ment, was received November 15, 1912, and the specimens thus 

 secured proved a valuable addition to those previously collected. 

 In December, 1913, data were obtained on the winter condition of 

 some of the forms here noted. 



The list of species here described is of course hardly more than 

 a check-list of those reptiles noted during the two months which 

 the party spent in the Okefinokee, and is no doubt very incomplete 

 as regards the extent of the reptilian fauna of the swamp, but it is 

 hoped that it will serve as a basis for future work and as an aid to 

 systematic zoologists interested in the forms of the region under 

 discussion. 



Acknowledgments are due to Dr. Leonard Stejneger, of the 

 United States National Museum, for the privilege of examining 

 types in the Museum collection, and to Mr. R. W. Bennett and Mr.

 of the swamp.

1. Macroclemmys temminckii Troost. Plate I, fig. 3. 



The alligator snapper, called by the natives "gator terrapin" 

 or "loggerhead," was reported as being common in the Okefinokee, 

 but very few specimens were seen by our party. No adults were 

 collected. The presence of the alligator snapper in the Okefinokee 

 carries its range eastward to the easternmost Gulf tributary (the 

 Suwannee) and the former eastern boundary of old West Florida. 

 Its association here with Chelydra serpentina suggests that the latter 

 may have been an Atlantic coast contribution through the St. Mary's. 



This turtle is said to attain a large size in its natural habitat in 

 the lakes of this region, and some evidence was secured to bear out 

 this statement. A specimen about eight inches in length' was cap- 

 tured June 17 and placed in a "bee-gum" for safekeeping. On 

 the return to the spot the next day, the turtle had escaped. Dave 

 Lee stated that he had seen turtles with the head alone as large as 

 the shell of this specimen. A skull of Macroclemmys temminckii 

 with the lower mandible missing was found on one of the islands, 

 and it proved by its measurements that this turtle approaches such 

 a size. This skull, old and much weathered, agrees exactly with 

 Boulenger's figure^ in the arrangement of bones and sutures and in 

 the position of the fossse. It measures as follows: 



Maximum length 6| inches, maximum width 6 inche>, width 

 between centres of orbital sockets 2§ inches, diameter of orbit 1 

 inch, distance from eye to snout (between openings) 1 inch, height 

 of upper mandible at anterior hook 2 inches, maximum width of 

 upper mandible (at posterior angle) 4 inches, width of nasal opening 

 1 inch. 



In connection with this data, a large scale, probably from the 

 shell of an "alligator snapper," was found in the swimming hole at 

 the boat landing on Billy's Island, June 9, 1912. This scale is flat, 

 thin, hard and fan-shaped; on the upper surface eight radiating 

 longitudinal ridges and numerous close, concentric, subparallel 

 transverse grooves, the under surface smooth and slightly undulating. 

 The scale is dry and brittle, much weathered and inclined to peel 

 on the upper surface and is the cephalic scale of one of the costal 

 series. Maximum length 5| inches, maximum width 5^ inches, 

 slightly broken on one side at distal angle. 



No eggs of this turtle were collected.

2. Chelydra serpentina (Linnaeus). Plate I, fig. 5; II, fig. 5. 



Two young snapping turtles were brought out of the swamp and 

 at the time were not carefully examined, but were suppo.3ed to be 

 young of the alligator snapper. On comparison with similar-sized 

 representatives of Chelydra serpentina taken at Ithaca, N. Y.-, they 

 prove to be identical with the northern specimens. They are without 

 the scalloped anterior margin of M. temminckii young, as represented 

 by Agassi z^ and do not possess the striking papillae of the young 

 of the alligator snapper. The orbits are directed outwards and 

 upwards as in C. serpentina and wholly unlike the condition in the 

 large skull of M. temminckii secured in the swamp. Furthermore, 

 no supramarginals appear in the carapace. The specimens are 

 small, the larger having a shell 1| inches long by 1^ inches wide. 

 A brief description may be given as follows: 



Carapace grayish-black; very rough; three distinct ridges, the 

 central highest; vertebral plates distinctly serrate at edges, inclined 

 to overlap, each plate roughly bifid posteriorly; marginal plates 

 thick, narrow, edges smooth anteriorly, strongly toothed posteriorly. 

 Plastron acute posteriorly; black with white marginal markings. 

 Head gray, skin tuberculate, white spot below angle of mandible 

 on each side. Neck black, skin loose and wrinkled. Legs black, 

 unmarked. Skin of head, neck, legs and under surface of body 

 gray or black, rough and finely tuberculate. Tail long, black, 

 spiny above, smooth below, gradually narrowing to apex. 



3. Cinosternum pennsylvanicum Bosc. Plate II, fig. 3. 



It is one of the common turtles of the swamp, found l^oth on land 

 and in the water. These turtles were often seen in the shallower 

 waters of the lakes and in the ponds on the islands and frequently 

 on the higher portions of the wooded areas where they came to 

 deposit their eggs. 



The specimens collected showed practically no variation in struc- 

 ture or coloration, and the adult as represented in the Okefinokee 

 fauna may be briefly described as follows: 



Carapace smooth and comparatively high; uniform dark brown 

 in color without markings, but occasionally with fine obsolete indented 

 lines; marginal plates narrow, brown above and reddish-yellow 

 below with brown markings on under side; both extremities of 

 carapace obtusely rounded. Plastron loosely hinged, not com- 

 pletely covering fleshy parts, especially posteriorly, deeply notched

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



behind; reddish-yellow, with deep brown rectangular grooves at 

 inner and posterior edges of plates; interstices between hinges, and 

 sutures between plates wide. Neck long; skin loose and much 

 Avrinkled; black above, sordid white beneath. Head comparatively 

 large; black or brown above, occasionally spotted with yellow or 

 greenish-yellow on sides, uniform white or yellow beneath; upper 

 mandible with strong curved blunt hook. Legs unmarked, brown- 

 black; claws long, strong and sharp. Tail thick and suddenly 

 acuminate at extremity. Average length of carapace 3| inches, 

 width 2| inches; plastron 3^ inches in length by 2 inches in width; 

 height of shell 1| inches; width of head | inch. 



The time during which the specimens were collected (May and 

 June) seemed to be the egg-laying season. A fine large female 

 (C. U., No. 6,456) was taken on the nest in the act of egg-laying, 

 June 11, 1912, and three eggs were found with the specimen. The 

 nest was in rotten wood by the side of a dead log and the eggs were 

 deposited at a depth of three inches below the surface of the decayed 

 Avood. In the stomach of a king snake {Ophibolus getulus) (C. U., 

 No. 6,138) taken on Billy's Island, June 11, 1912, was found one 

 egg of Cinosternum pennsrjlvanicum, together with two eggs of 

 Chrysem.ys floridana. Another king snake (C. U., No. 6,146) taken 

 on Billy's Island had what was apparently the shells of Cinosternum 

 eggs in its stomach, and a third snake of the same species also taken 

 on Billy's Island had in its stomach a large number of crushed and 

 finely broken shells of the same kind of eggs. Finally, Mr. Harper 

 relates how he and Dave Lee stumbled upon a king snake, and when 

 they had recovered they found a small Cinosternum digging in the 

 sand — all of which seems strong circumstantial evidence to prove 

 the snake was on hand to scoop the eggs the instant they were laid. 

 These turtles, therefore, evidently come up to the woody parts of 

 the islands during this season to deposit their eggs, which often 

 furnish food for the snakes and, according to the Lees, also for other 

 animals of the swamp. 



A number of the eggs of this turtle were collected, but owing to 

 the evaporation of the liquid from the containers in which they 

 were placed, none were preserved in a condition satisfactory for 

 accurate description or measurements. The eggs were elliptical, 

 approximately 30 mm. long by 15 mm. in diameter and of a pinkish- 

 white color. The shells seem to be slightly more brittle and appar- 

 ently less granular than those of Chrysemys floridana.

4. Sternothoerus carina tus (Gray). 



Two specimens of musk turtles, agreeing with each other in every 

 particular of structure and markings, were taken in the Okefinokee. 

 These specimens represent an interesting form of S. carinatus. They 

 differ from the normal in that the distinct black spots of the head 

 are very obsolete and the black streaks or spots of the carapace, 

 usually so prominent, are almost absent or only faintly visible. 

 The gular shield is very small, a raised boss or knob. 



The carapace is very rough, the vertebral plates sharp and inclined 

 to overlap; dark brown in color, rubbed off to sordid yellow in 

 spots; characteristic markings of carapace faint; both extremities 

 of carapace obtusely rounded and slightly serrate, upper surface 

 distinctly three ridged with central carina prominent; plastron 

 almost solid, very narrow posteriorly and weakly notched behind; 

 uniform yellow in color. Head dark brown with obsolete black 

 spots, no lines above or below eyes; snout tapering and conical; 

 under jaw with longitudinal black stripes. Legs uniform black; feet 

 broadly webbed; claws thin and sharp. Tail thick and suddenly 

 acuminate at apex. The larger specimen measures as follows: 

 Length of carapace 3f inches, width 2^ inches; length of plastron, 

 2| inches, maximum width 2 inches; height of shell IJ inches; 

 width of head | inch. 



No eggs or young of this turtle were collected and no data were 

 secured as to its habits or life history. 



5. Chrysemys floridana LeConte. Plate II, fig. 4 ; III, fig. 6. 



This is probably the commonest turtle on the islands of the swamp. 

 They were often seen on- the sandy banks where they came to deposit 

 their eggs, or found sunning themselves on the logs in the lakes 

 and crossways or in the smaller cypress ponds on the islands. These 

 turtles were active and hard to approach, unless taken with great 

 caution from the rear, but were numerous and often observed. 

 They were very common about the Lees' clearing, where not infre- 

 quently the eggs were plowed up, and were also found on Mixon's 

 Hammock in a cleared sandy portion just west of a prominent 

 Indian mound. About the Lees' clearing the dogs often discovered 

 these turtles and by barking attracted the attention of members 

 of the party. The dogs in the same way were constantly surprising 

 the turtles on the hammocky edges of the island as the reptiles were 

 returning to the water after laying their eggs. In endeavoring to 

 arrest the progress of the turtles, the dogs usually had recourse to 

 claws and teeth, and many of the specimens secured show deep 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



scratches on the shell which are no doubt evidences of such en- 

 counters. 



Thirteen adults, four young and a large number of eggs were 

 brought out of the swamp and numbers were collected which were 

 not preserved. The month during which most of the specimens 

 were taken (June) seemed to be the egg-laying season. The eggs, 

 usually numbering from twelve to twenty, were found in the sand. 

 One female killed for soup, June 4, 1912, contained sixteen eggs 

 ready for depositing. A bear, killed May 30, had in its stomach 

 twelve eggs, one of which was whole, and signs were plentiful to 

 prove that the bears dug these eggs from the sand. When an egg 

 complement was found exposed or only partly covered by the sand, 

 or with the complement very small, the natives asserted that the 

 turtle had been disturbed in the midst of egg-laying by the attack 

 of bears or had been frightened from the eggs by these animals.^ 

 A king snake (Ophiholus getulus getulus, C. U., No. 6,147), captured 

 June 26, 1912, had fourteen eggs in its stomach. Another king 

 snake (C. U., No. 6,140), taken June 3, had thirteen eggs in its 

 stomach. The stomachs of three other specimens of the same 

 species of snake contained, respectively, one, two, and six eggs of 

 Chrysemijs floridana. It seems yqvj likely that other snakes and 

 perhaps other mammals, such as coons, find the eggs of this turtle 

 a palatable article of diet. The eggs were also eaten by the Lees, 

 and those eggs which w^ere immature and secured before fertiliza- 

 tion had taken place were pronounced by members of our party 

 excellent eating; the older eggs seemed bitter. 



The natives called this turtle the "cooter, " and it was also locally 

 kno^^'n as the "hard-back cooter. " 



The specimens taken showed little variation in structure or mark- 

 ings. INIost of those captured were females with decidedly convex 

 plastron. The size of the shells of the mature specimens averaged 

 about 1 foot in length by 11 inches in width and 5 inches in height. 

 The largest specimen taken (No. 6,433) measured as follows: Length 

 of carapace 13| inches, width 12 inches; length of plastron 11| inches, 

 width 6^ inches; height of shell 5| inches. The adult of Chrysemys 

 floridana, as found in the Okefinokee, may be described as follows: 



Carapace very high and dome-shaped; black-brown; vertebral 

 plates smooth except anterior and posterior ones which are slightly 

 wrinkled; costal plates with deep longitudinal wrinkles on upper

 were literally torn up by bears, coons, etc., which search for "cooter's" eggs.

three-fourths, lower fourth with transverse ridges; marginal plates 

 smooth or lightly longitudinally rugose, the posterior sometimes 

 slightly serrate at joints; vertebral plates marked with heavy 

 longitudinal yellow line on each side of middle with fainter cross- 

 lines of same color; costal plates with broad median yellow 

 line extending outward, often bifurcate at distal end and some- 

 times surrounded with hieroglyphics of wavy lines of the same 

 color; marginal plates with distinct median yellow band extending 

 outward, rarely fainter bands on each side. Plastron uniform 

 lemon-yellow, convex anteriorly, deeply notched posteriorly; edge 

 of marginal plates with black spots beneath, varying in number, but 

 usually five on each side. Head very small; eyes large; head and 

 neck striped with yellow; median longitudinal bifurcated yellow- 

 Avhite line on underside of head, sometimes with white line inside 

 bifurcation and yellow line on either side. Legs and feet deep 

 brown-black marked ^vith yellow stripes. Claws very long, the 

 middle three of the anterior limb longest. 



One specimen was taken in which the median stripe of the mar- 

 ginal plates was decorated on each side with a semicircular line 

 followed by a short bar, thus agreeing with Holbrook's figure.^ 



The young specimens collected lacked the high, dome-like carapace 

 of the adults. The shells were almost round and about 1| inches 

 in diameter. 



Description. — Carapace slate-colored, averaging three-fourths of 

 an inch in height and abruptly keeled in the middle. Costal plates 

 smooth with distinct median white line sometimes bordered by 

 faint wavy lines of the same color. Marginal plates smooth, edges 

 serrate at joints, decorated with median white line followed on each 

 side by semicircular white line and white dot. Plastron clear light 

 yellow. Under surface of marginal plates with line of black dots 

 extending entirely around the shell. Middle three claws of anterior 

 limb not very long, as in adults. 



From the specimens examined it w^ould appear that the young and 

 immature forms are likely to show the markings of the carapace, 

 the decorated marginal plates and the black spots of the under 

 margin of the marginal plates more distinctly than the larger forms. 



The eggs collected were uniform in size, shape and color. Shape 

 ovate-elliptical, color pinkish-white, surface slightly granular, shells 

 cjuite soft. Of 103 eggs measured, the average length proved to be

34.16 mm., and the average diameter 24.15 mm.; the mode 35x24 

 mm.; the maximum length 40.5 mm., and the maximum diameter 

 27 mm.; the minimum length 33 mm., and the minimum diameter 

 22 mm. 



6. Chrysemys reticulatus Bosc. 



Three specimens of Chrysemys reticulatus were secured in the 

 Okefinokee, two on Billy's Island and one on Honey Island. The 

 field notes of members of the party do not record any others as 

 having been seen, and it is probable that this is one of the less common 

 turtles of the swamp. The specimens secured agree with the pub- 

 lished descriptions and there can be little doubt as to the identity 

 of the species. 



The largest specimen, which is probably most tj^ical in all re- 

 spects save the markings, may be described briefly as follows: 



Carapace dull brown; thickly covered with fine reticulated grooves; 

 each plate with a distinct flat marginal border; shell rather high, 

 smooth in general outline; marginal plates with obsolete median 

 yellow line; under side of each marginal plate with black spot, 

 sometimes coalesced with that of the neighboring plate. Plastron 

 smooth, reddish-yellow, median plates with a distinct tinge of red. 

 Neck very long, skin loose, black. Head brown above with faint 

 yellow markings; yellow beneath with distinct reticulated brown 

 lines. Fore legs with wide yellow band in front, yellow below; 

 feet black beneath; claws long. Under surface of hind legs and 

 tail 3^ellow; hind legs with alternate black and yellow lines pos- 

 teriorly; tail with two black lines on under side. Measurements: 

 Length of carapace 8| inches, width 7 inches; length of plastron 

 6| inches, width 4 inches; height of shell 3| inches; width of head 

 lyg- inches; interorbital space less than f long diameter of the eye; 

 orbits distinctly upwards and outwards in direction. 



The second specimen differs from the first only in size, in ha\ing 

 the carapace somewhat indented and in the darker colors and less 

 conspicuous markings. In this specimen the lines on the under 

 side of the head are more nearly parallel, and the yellow color less 

 evident on the legs. The under side of the marginals would be 

 wholly without black spots but for three very indistinct ones. The 

 two spots on the bridge are widely separated. 



The smallest of the three specimens was found on Honey Island 

 and differs from the others only in the markings of the carapace 

 and in the more brilliant colors of the body. The carapace of this 

 specimen is smooth, without grooves, and beautifully decorated with

bright yellow, narrow reticulated lines covering the vertebral and 

 costal plates; the marginal plates have a distinct median j^ellow 

 band, in some instances this is connected with reticulate lines of 

 vertebral and costal plates. The plastron is clear lemon-yellow 

 with black band at extreme outer edge of abdominal and pectoral 

 plates and on the axillary and inguinal plates. There is no variation 

 in the pattern of the markings from that of the older and larger 

 specimens, but the colors are much more evident. 



No data were obtained as to the life history or the habits of this 

 species. 



7. Terrapene Carolina Linn. 



One specimen of Terrapene Carolina was taken on Honey Island, 

 June 2, 1912. The natives of the swamp call all box turtles "lock- 

 ups," and report that they are comparatively numerous, but only 

 two specimens were collected during the time our party was in the 

 swamp, one Terrapene Carolina and one Terrapene major. 



The specimen of Terrapene Carolina taken measured 6§ inches in 

 length, with a plastron (completely closed) 5| inches long; the total 

 height of the shell 2| inches. Carapace dome-shaped, higher behind 

 than in front, smooth as to general surface but with slight indenta- 

 tions on the middle vertebral plates; entirely covered with irregular 

 dark yellow spots recalling Ditmar's comparison^'' of having been 

 spotted with a brush. At the external margin of the costal plates 

 a few irregular yellow lines extend outward. The shell shows no 

 keel and the marginal plates are not flared. The edges of the mar- 

 ginal plates are yellow and the under side of the same plates marked 

 with brown posteriorly. Plastron uniform yellow, interstices 

 between plates brownish. 



No eggs or young of this turtle were found and no data obtained 

 as to its life history. The Lees stated that box turtles were very 

 common in ''The Pocket," but no opportunity offered for the inves- 

 tigation of this statement. 



8. Terrapene major Agassiz. 



One small specimen of Terrapene major, measuring 6| inches in 

 leng-th, was taken from "The Pocket" on June 29, 1912. 



This species may be distinguished from Terrapene Carolina, the 

 only other box turtle taken in the swamp, by the flaring posterior 

 marginal plates, the blunt keel behind, the bright yellow median

line extending the entire lengtli of the carapace, and the groups of 

 radiating yellow lines marking the costal plates. 



The carapace is chocolate-brown in color with characteristic 

 radiating yellow lines on the upper surface of the costal plates and 

 subparallel yellow bands extending outward on the external margins; 

 each plate is marked with regular concentric subrectangular grooves. 

 Plastron (closed) 5f inches in length and 3| inches in width; uniform 

 yellow in color with a reddish-broAvn spot on the external posterior 

 angle of each plate; all plates showing parallel grooves along the 

 median line, and in the case of the abdominal plates these grooves 

 make a right angle at the median anterior corner of the plate and 

 extend laterad reaching the margin. Under side of marginal plates 

 yellow with irregular markings of brown. 



. In the one specimen taken, the posterior end of the shell is some- 

 what mutilated. 



9. Platypeltis ferox Schweigger. Plate I, figs. 1, 2, 24; II, fig. 6. 



This species is common throughout the swamp. Adults, young 

 and eggs were collected, and the field notes show that this turtle 

 was recorded from Billy's Island, Honey Island, Floyd's Island, 

 Mixon's Hammock, Billy's Lake, Minne Lake and Sweet Water. 

 This species is doubtless to be found in all parts of the Okefinokee, 

 and is especially abundant in those places where the water is deep 

 and the bottom soft. The natives claim that soft-shelled turtles 

 are to be found wherever there are alligators, and this fact seems 

 to be borne out by the observations made on these turtles. On 

 May 31, 1912, an attempt w^as made to seine a " 'gator hole" on the 

 Honey Island Prairies. Before seining, Bryant Lee went over the 

 hole "grunting," a method locally used to start the aUigators, which 

 animals, it is claimed, will respond to this peculiar vocal accomplish- 

 ment and show their presence by rows of bubbles on the surface by 

 which they may be followed. In this instance the supposed alligator 

 was pursued for some distance, only to prove to be a large Platypeltis. 

 It is not improbable that the deep, secluded "'gator holes" may 

 furnish a favored retreat for this turtle whose ability to defend 

 itself by its powerful mandibles and snake-like bite is well known 

 and may be sufficient protection against the alligator itself. Accord- 

 ing to the Lees, this turtle is very active and can use its legs to a 

 remarkable degree, especially wdiile in the water, and plenty of 

 evidence was secured to show that its legs and knife-edged beak were 

 no mean weapons. A captured specimen, a foot or more in length, 

 which was kept around the camp for several days, showed a sur- 




120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



prising ability to dig through the sand and could jump forward 

 practically its own length. 



On account of the size and weight of this turtle, it was impracti- 

 cable to carry a large series out of the Okefinokee with the limited 

 means of conveyence afforded to the expedition, but sufficient data 

 were secured from the large number of specimens observed to give a 

 fairly accurate account of their appearance, habits and life history. 

 A number of heads, skulls, carapaces, young turtles and eggs, both 

 mature and embryonic, were collected and brought out of the swamp, 

 and notes were made on the adults in their native environment. 



The adult turtle may be described as follows from an average 

 specimen taken June 12, 1912, on Billy's Island, and preserved as 

 C. U., No. 6,471. 



Carapace chocolate-colored with obsolete irregular patches of 

 black; strongly tuberculate at anterior end, with faint, subparallel, 

 longitudinal rows of tubercles extending the entire length of the 

 vertebral and costal regions of the carapace and becoming more 

 prominent and pronounced at the posterior end; marginal area soft 

 and flabby, especially at posterior half. Plastron smooth, yellowish- 

 white, extending well forward and somewhat exceeding the carapace, 

 almost entirely covering the fleshy parts anteriorly, narrower behind 

 and leaving much of the posterior part of the body exposed. Head 

 comparatively small, smooth, brown, markings very faint; snout 

 developed into a long fleshy proboscis; lips fleshy. Tail thick; 

 vent close to end; extremity of tail suddenly' acuminate beyond 

 vent. Measurements: Carapace 15| inches long, 11 inches wide; 

 plastron 11| inches long, 10 inches wide; height of shell 5 inches; 

 width of head 2| inches. 



The heads were cut off from some of the larger specimens and 

 preserved when it was impossible to carry the entire turtle. 



Such a head, representing one of the largest of the turtles cap- 

 tured (No. 6,473), measures 3^ inches in maximum width, 2 inches 

 in height, | inch between eyes, 3 inches from snout to angle of mandi- 

 ble, and shows a proboscis | inch in length. The head is brown 

 above, with white on snout, below the eyes and at edges of mandibles, 

 and yellowish-white on the entire under side. The e3^es are small 

 and, as will be noticed from the measurements, near together. The 

 head is strongly tapering and the opening of the mouth well inferior. 

 The lips are fleshy with loose skin and the jaws large and strong. 

 This head was from a large female taken June 22, 1912, which con- 

 tained 49 embryonic eggs in an advanced stage of development. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



The complete skull of a soft-shelled turtle, with cartilages of 

 mandibles still attached, was found on Billy's Island, June 19, 1912. 

 This skull agrees with Boulenger's short description" and in all 

 general features with Hegner's figure,^- and, while much weathered, 

 shows the bones and sutures in excellent shape. It is remarkable 

 for the high supraoccipital ridge (the two squamosal ridges being 

 damaged) and for the very flat temporal region. 



This skull measures 3f inches in length, 2| inches in wicUh, ^ inch 

 between eyes, diameter of sockets | inch, distance from orbital to 

 nasal opening f inch, length of lower mandible 2^ inches, width of 

 lower mandible at posterior angle 2| inches, height of lower mandible 

 at middle | inch, distance between orbit and auditory cavity f inch, 

 distance from orbit to margin of upper mandible | inch, maximum 

 height of head, including both mandibles, If inches. 



Several carapaces of Platypeltis ferox, much weathered and usually 

 more or less mutilated at the edges, were found on Billy's Island. 



Such a carapace shows the upper surface white and finely reticulate, 

 with pits prominent and the sutures distinct. Nine neural plates 

 are present, the anterior very broad and without corresponding 

 costals on either side (i.e., is a nuchal); in form rectangular, about 

 twice as long as wide. Seven costal plates on each side, parallel 

 and regular, and extending transversely across the carapace. The 

 marginal area appears brown and leathery, the plates fused. The 

 under surface of the carapace is smooth and yellow-white. The 

 ribs are prominent and imbedded in the plates of the carapace; 

 eight on each side, extending more or less radiately from the verte- 

 bral column. This column is likewise fused with the carapace and 

 presents nine vertebrae. One carapace with nine neural plates had 

 eight, not seven, pairs of costal plates, the last two pairs meeting 

 on the median line where the neurals are absent. These carapaces 

 are about 9 inches in length, 8 inches in breadth and 2 inches in 

 height. 



A good series of young soft-shelled turtles were collected in the 

 swamp and preserved. These range in size from If to 3|- inches in 

 length and show plainly the brilliant, characteristic markings of the 

 carapace, especially when the shells are wet. The smallest specimens 

 agree well with Ditmar's figure." 



The carapace is gray-black, strongly marked with irregularly

122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar.^ 



placed round black spots. Vertebral and costal regions finely, 

 longitudinally rugose with broken lines of linear tubercles; anterior 

 tubercles very small. The marginal area smooth, brown and broadly 

 edged with white. Plastron soft, slate-colored, a white spot on 

 each side of the median line ; plastron extends far forward, exceeding 

 the carapace anteriorly, short behind, leaving posterior fleshy parts 

 exposed. Head, neck and under parts of body black. Neck long, 

 skin loose and much wrinkled. Snout long, white beneath, white 

 spot at base of snout with white line from this spot to each eye, and 

 white line at edge of mandibles. 



As the specimens become older, the gayly colored markings of the 

 carapace become less distinct and have disappeared on turtles which 

 have attained a length of 6 inches. The anterior tubercles of the 

 shell become better developed and the whole carapace rougher. 

 The plastron grows lighter in color and the head uniformly darker, 

 with the markings obsolete. A small specimen of a young soft- 

 shelled turtle was found in the stomach of a water moccasin (Ancistro- 

 don piscivorus, No. 6,214) taken late in the summer. Very likely, 

 while in this soft-shelled, fleshy state, these turtles furnish an accept- 

 able addition to the food of the larger snakes and perhaps to other 

 animals of the swamp. 



Eggs of Platypeltis ferox were easily secured. They were usually 

 found in the sandy fields and occasionally the turtles were captured 

 at the places of oviposition. The eggs were generally deposited in 

 two or three inches of sand in some place where the surface of the 

 earth was warmed by the direct rays of the sun. One complement 

 of twenty-two eggs was discovered, June 26, on Floyd's Island in 

 which the eggs were uncovered. This was probably clue, however, 

 to the fact that the turtle had been in some manner frightened 

 before the egg-laying process was completed. The eggs are almost 

 exactly spherical, averaging 31 mm. in diameter, almost white, 

 somewhat brittle, surface slightly granular and shells very thin. A 

 number of complements of embryonic eggs at various stages of 

 development were taken from turtles and brought out for study. 

 These eggs are bright orange colored, becoming lighter as they 

 mature, and are practically spherical. They vary in size from 

 15 mm. to 32 mm. in diameter, with soft, indented skins, smooth 

 and fragile. In one specimen of Platypeltis (No. 6,484) were found 

 twenty eggs graduating from very small bright orange ovules to one 

 fully developed white egg 31 mm. in diameter, seemingly ready for 

 depositing. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 123 



According to the data secured, it would appear that the egg- 

 laying season for this turtle is represented by the months of June 

 and July. The young turtles feed on fish and frogs, and according 

 to the natives the larger specimens devour also such water fowl as 

 are unfortunate enough to be taken unaware by these reptiles. They 

 frequent the deepest parts of the streams and lakes, but come out 

 to the sandy portions of the islands to deposit their eggs. They 

 are vicious, active, and are among the largest of the Reptilia of the 

 Okefinokee. 



Lacertilia. 



10. Anolis carolinensis Cuvier. 



Common throughout the higher portions of the swamp. Most 

 common on the islands, but seen also on bushes in the swamp proper. 

 Recorded on Billy's Island, Gallberry Island, "The Pocket," Honey 

 Island, Mixon's Hammock, Minne Lake Islands, in the crossway 

 between Billy's Island and Gallberry Island and on the trail from 

 Billy's Island to Minne Lake Islands. Found chiefly on large 

 bushes and small deciduous trees, where it dodged around the limbs 

 at the approach of the collector. This species is quite active and 

 adept at climbing. 



The Okefinokee specimens are practically uniform in size and 

 structure. Several of the specimens had suffered the loss of part 

 of the tail, but the measurements of body parts showed little varia- 

 tion. The average length of the body to vent was 50 mm., and of 

 the tail about 90 mm. In life the usual color of the dorsal surface 

 of the body and tail was light green; the ventral surface almost 

 white, except the belly, which was blue or bluish. The alcoholic 

 specimens show the dorsal colors ranging from slate-gray to dark 

 blue-green, with the ventral surface of the head, throat, and breast 

 showing shades of pink with minute dark spots in longitudinal rows, 

 and the throat often having a loose reddish fold. The belly ranges 

 through various shades of gray and blue, with the vent and under 

 surface of the hind legs lighter. The tail is uniformly blue-green 

 below. 



The scale and plate arrangement proved to be practically constant. 

 The dorsal head ridges in the smaller specimens were sometimes 

 more or less indistinct, but generally showed 11 to 15 plates. The 

 canthus rostralis uniformly consisted of six plates; the upper labials 

 of 10 to 12; the lower labials of 11 to 13. 



The nostrils appear on a line between the first and second superior 

 labials and above the canthus rostralis. The Jatter is always well 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



developed and prominent. The rostral plate is very broad. The 

 lower jaw has no median symphyseal plate, the first infralabials of 

 the two sides meeting on the median line. 



No data were secured which would give any information regarding 

 the breeding habits of the species in the swamp. 



On December 22. 1914, Dr. Bradley found a small, shriveled 

 specimen of Anolis carolinensis in a pitcher plant. From a botanical 

 standpoint, it would be interesting to know whether this plant is 

 able to capture forms as large as this lizard. 



Incidently it may be noted that this was the only lizard seen by 

 Dr. Bradley on this trip, and it would appear that the lizards are 

 not commonly out at this season of the year. 



11. Sceloporus undulatus Latrielle. Figs. 1, 2. 



Aljundant throughout the higher and drier portion of the Okefinokee 

 and called by the natives "scaly hzard." Most common on the 

 sandy pine lands, where they seem to prefer the fallen timber, logs 

 a.nd stumps, and always to be found around fences and piles of cut 

 wood. Very active and, like many of the other lizards, difficult to 

 secure without the loss of some portion of the tail. 



The specimens taken proved to be fairly uniform in size, the 

 largest measuring 155 mm. in total length and the smallest 122 mm. 

 In the comparative measurements the figures show a pronounced 

 agreement. The length to vent is slightly less than one-half the 

 total length; the length of the fore leg almost exactly equal to the 

 distance from the anterior end of the head to the axilla; the hind 

 foot about one-half the length of the hind leg, and the width of the 

 head about equal to the length of the fore foot. 



The colors are somewhat variable. The dorsal surface is usually 

 grayish-black, sometimes a brilliant black. The undulating cross- 

 bands are often very faint or obsolete; when distinct they are gen- 

 erally 10 or 11 in number with the white markings prominent. The 

 ventral surface of the body is yellowish-white with numerous dark 

 spots in more or less regular rows. Down the median ventral line 

 these spots run together to form a longitudinal stripe, which in all of 

 the specimens from the swamp is quite prominent. Superimposed 

 on the spotted gray-white body color may be found patches of black 

 or blue, the latter usually on the throat and sides of the belly. Occa- 

 sionally the throat shows on each side a brilliant light l^lue. In a 

 few specimens the ventral surface of the head and belly appears 

 brilliant black. The breast and pelvic region is almost invariably 

 sordid yellow-white with the characteristic dark spots. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 125 



The femoral pores are always present, ranging in number from 

 thirteen to fifteen, and sometimes very prominent on the smnmit 

 of a high ridge. 



The plates of the head are clearly defined and easily distinguished^ 

 but in some regions most irregular and complicated in arrangement. 

 The specimens usually show five supraorbitals (in three cases six) 

 separated from the median plates of the head by a single row of 

 small scales and bordered externally by two or three rows of super- 

 ciliaries. The usual arrangement of these superciliaries is in two 

 irregular rows with occasionally one or two plates of a third row. 

 The labial plates appear very uniform, the superior row containing 

 five plates and the inferior six. In one or two of the larger specimens 

 this was increased to 6-7. 



The plates of the median dorsal region of the head, however, 

 present a most interesting variation. It is of interest to note that 

 no two of the specimens taken were alike as to the number and 

 arrangement of the plates of this region, although all were collected 

 in the same locality within a period of one month. A chscussion 

 of these plates is rendered difficult by the fact that the descriptions 

 by various authors differ widely in terminology, and it is not easy 

 to determine upon consistent names for the series of plates which 

 may be found. The occipital is large and polygonal and sometimes 

 subdivided (Nos. 6,408, 6,414, 6,415). It contains the pineal eye, 

 which is always present. This plate is bordered by a row of smaller 

 plates ranging in number from four to seven (cf. Nos. 6,413, 6,417 

 and 6,418). Anterior to the occipital in a small single plate, some- 

 times adjacent (No. 6,410) and sometimes separated by the two 

 anterior plates of the bordering row (No. 6,411). The next plate 

 anteriorly is a large pentagonal or hexagonal plate slightly anterior 

 to the middle of the eye. The next row may consist of two or of 

 three plates. If of three, the middle one is small (cf. Nos. 6,402, 

 6,406 and 6,413). The next plate is large and may be subdivided 

 to form an irregular transverse row. The single condition is shown 

 in Nos. 6,405, 6,406, 6,407, 6,414 and 6,415; the subdivided con- 

 dition in Nos. 6,409 and 6,412. Anterior to this plate, and between 

 it and the internasals, there may or may not appear a row of plates 

 ' (when present usually three) , more or less regular and usually pentag- 

 onal. This row is shown in Nos. 6,405, 6,406, 6,407, 6,415, 6,417 

 and 6,418. The two internasals are comparatively large, very irregu- 

 lar in shape and seldom bilaterally symmetrical. They are almost 

 directly above the nostrils. They may be subdivided (No. 6,410),

or one may be subdivided and the other not (Nos. 6,408 and 6,411). 

 Between the internasals and the rostrum appear two plates, usually 

 unsymmetrical, and apparently twisted out of position. Their 

 longest diameter may be transverse (No. 6,412) or longitudinal 

 (No. 6,413), and there is sometimes found a third plate in the row 

 (No. 6,409). 



In spite of the fact, however, that all of these median plates of 

 the head may be so irregular, so twisted from a bilateral condition,

Fig. 2. — Sceloporus undulalus Latr. Plates of the head. 



SO confusing in arrangement, and so liable to subdivision, it might 

 be pointed out that the series of rows is comparatively uniform. 

 The hypothetical arrangement of the most simple condition might 

 be represented by the figure (fig. 2), and from this arrangement all 

 of the variations shown could be developed. Whether such a simple 

 arrangement would represent the most generalized form or not 

 would be a matter of conjecture. 



12. Ophisaurus ventralis Linn. Fig. 3. 



Three specimens of Ophisaurus ventralis were taken in the Oke- 

 finokee. The Lees, however, report that this lizard is not uncommon 

 and call it the ''grass snake," giving as an explanation of the name 

 the fact that they have noticed that its locomotion appeared difficult 

 ■except in grassy places. They apply the name "joint snake" to an 

 entirely different reptile, which they describe as having joints around 

 the body and which may be Rhineura floridana, although no speci- 

 mens were seen of this form. The three specimens collected were 

 taken in the grass on Billy's Island, but no data were secured as to 

 their life history or habits. 



The two smallest specimens are quite different from the third and 

 largest and may be discussed first. These specimens measured, 




128 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mar., 



respectively, 590 mm. and 355 mm. in length, the chief difference 

 being in the length of the tails. The longer of the two measured 

 162 mm. to vent and the smaller 127 mm., while the distances from 

 tip of rostrmn to eye and to ear in both specimens were identical. 

 The head of the longer specimen was 1| mm. broader than that of 

 the other. The two specimens agreed in scalation and in color. 

 The dorsal surface was light, rather cinnamon-brown, with three 

 very dark brown longitudinal stripes, two lateral and one dorsal, 

 the dorsal being slightly fainter than the lateral. The sides of the 

 head and of the anterior part of the body appear spotted ; the entire 

 ventral surface of body and tail uniform lemon-yellow. The dorsal 

 rows of scales, of which there are sixteen, are separated from the 

 ten ventral rows by a distinct groove. The preanal scales are 

 slightly larger than the abdominal. The dorsal scales of the body 

 are carinate and are wider than long. The color and stripes therefore 

 agree with Cope's description of variation "11. J."^^ 



64 85 



Fig. 3. — Ophisaurus ventrnlis Linn. 



The plates of the head show the interfrontonasals separated from 

 the frontal by the two prefrontals which are in contact on the median 

 line and thus agree with Cope's "I. C.,"^'^ l:)ut in addition show two 

 interfrontonasals, one anterior to the other, as in the subspecies 

 compressus (Ophisaurus ventralis compressiis Cope). These speci- 

 mens also agree with compressus in having but two rows of plates 

 between the labials and the canthal row; in having two large superior 

 labials touching the orbit below, and in having the caudal plates 

 at the extremity of the tail longer than wide — characters which are 

 given as peculiar to compressus. The coloration, however, does 

 not agree with that given for compressus, and the body does not

show in the least the typical compression which distinguishes that 

 subspecies. In coloration these two specimens apparently agree 

 with U. S. Nat. Mus. Cat., No. 10,581, which Cope said restrained 

 him "from regarding the form compressus as a distinct species." 

 It is, nevertheless, interesting to note the gradation, since it makes 

 these forms from the swamp seem to stand between the typical 

 ventraUs and its unique subspecies, the standing of which may be 

 subject to question. 



The largest of the three specimens is quite distinct in color and 

 form, although found in exactly the same locality, and may be 

 briefly characterized as follows: 



Body very stout and thick; dark brown above with many small 

 white spots irregularly placed on the head, and in more or less regular 

 longitudinal and transverse rows or lines on the dorsal surface of 

 the body and tail, giving the whole a checkered appearance. The 

 stripes are obsolete. Under surface of body sordid yellow-white; 

 the tail clear lemon-yellow beneath. There is but one interfronto- 

 nasal, and the superior labials do not touch the orbit. Superior 

 labials ten in number. Length 525 mm., maximum width 20 mm., 

 length to vent 265 mm. 



13. Cnemidophorus sexlineatus Linn. Plate II, fig. 2. 



Apparently common throughout the islands of the swamp. Cer- 

 tainly one of the most common lizards on Billy's Island. Also 

 numerous on Honey Island and Minne Lake Islands. This lizard, 

 in spite of its swiftness, was easier to secure in the field than the 

 other common species on account of the fact that it did not possess 

 the disconcerting habit of dashing along fences and through the 

 underbrush. 



It is locally known as the "race-nag," a name which, like many 

 of the other names used by the inhabitants of the swamp, was 

 strikingly descriptive, since the lizard is so remarkably active and 

 scurries over the ground with surprising speed when disturbed. 

 It appeared most abundantly in the plowed fields where the Lees 

 had planted corn, peas and goobers, and since these plowed fields 

 are very sandy, the common name of "sand lizard or swift" is quite 

 appropriate. They were commonly seen among the "goober" 

 vines where their colors blended well with the lights and shadows 

 under the leaves. These lizards seemed to prefer the bare furrows 

 for sunning themselves, and in the raised earth between the furrows 

 iiad dug their holes, into which they darted when disturbed. These 

 burrows extended in irregular directions to a depth of 8 or 10 inches, 

 9 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



which made the digging up of the hzards a comparatively easy task. 

 Between the plowed furrows, also, in holes from 4 to 12 inches deep, 

 were deposited the eggs, usually four or five together. The eggs 

 were about 16 mm. in length by 10 mm. in greatest diameter, 

 ellipsoidal, comparatively soft, semitranslucent, and almost salmon- 

 colored; not smooth or shining, but slightly rough and subpubescent. 



Little data were secured on the life history or the breeding habits, 

 but from the fact that eggs were secured at this time — June — and 

 .also the fact that several of the specimens taken showed the blue 

 abdomen characteristic of the breeding male, it is evident that this 

 month represents at least a part of the breeding and egg-laying 

 season. Since, moreover, the reptilian developmental period is 

 comparatively long, the bulk of ovulation must have been practically 

 over, or some of the females taken would have been found with 

 eggs, which was not the case. Specimens of C sexlineatus were 

 found in the stomachs of two blacksnakes (Zamenis constrictor 

 constrictor, C. U., Nos. 6,157 and 6,155), a fact which shows that this 

 species of lizard, like many others, shares the fate of providing food 

 for the larger reptiles of the swamp. 



The variations of the specimens taken are especially interesting 

 from the fact that all those described are from one locality and were 

 all taken within a period of approximately a month, so that the 

 variations cannot be explained by season or habitat. 



A number of striking differences may be observed in the Okefinokee 

 forms as compared with Cope's description and figure,^^ which were 

 used as a basis for study. It should be noted that the figure shown 

 by this author (p. 594) does not agree with the description (pp. 594- 

 596). This is particularly true in the discussion of the head and 

 anal regions. For example, the figure (cf . Cat. No. 4,878, U. S. N. M.) 

 shows a small plate between the frontoparietals, while no mention 

 is made of such a structure in the text; the figure shows seven 

 supralabial plates, while the text notes five; four anal plates are 

 figured, while the description states that three is the correct number. 

 On the whole, the specimens examined conform much more closely 

 to the text of Cope than to his figure. 



The following variations are to be found in the Okefinokee speci- 

 mens, these variations being chiefly in scale and plate arrangement 

 rather than in size or comparative measurements, although none 

 were collected in the swamp which were as long as 235 mm., the

length of No. 9,256, U. S. N. M., which is given by Cope as tyiDical. 

 A table of measurements of various parts of the body shows a close 

 agreement in the relative sizes of body parts. The plates of the 

 head agree fairly well in number, but differ greatly in size and shape. 

 One of the most variable of the plates is the first supraorbital, which 

 may be entire, cleft, parted or completely divided, cutting off a small 

 caudolateral portion as a separate plate. The frontoparietals are 

 usually subequal to the parietals, but are sometimes smaller, seldom 

 larger. The frontal is usually pentagonal in shape, but the surface 

 varies from a deeply three-ridged condition, which is the most 

 common, through an obsoletely three-ridged surface to one practically 

 flat or slightly convex. The interparietal plate is sometimes bifid, 

 sometimes flat, but oftenest high at the centre and at the edge, 

 wdth a submarginal depression or moat which is well defined. Pos- 

 terior to the parietals and interparietal the plates are most irregular 

 and variable. In some specimens one or two distinct rows of plates 

 are found in this region, with from five to eight plates in a row; in 

 others only one well-defined row is present, and this is often inter- 

 spaced with very small plates or scales; more often all of the plates 

 of this region are small and indefinite in arrangement. The super- 

 ciliaries of the orbit vary from three to six, the usual number appear- 

 ing to be five. Of these the anterior two are carinate and the others 

 are convex or flat. The inferior orbitals range from three to five, 

 the anterior and posterior being usually small. The superior labials 

 are generally five in number; one specimen examined showed seven, 

 two had six, and one, four. One of the most constant of the charac- 

 ters of the species seemed to be the femoral pores, of which fifteen 

 were found in the most typical specimens, the range being from 

 thirteen to seventeen, but other numbers than fifteen appearing 

 very rarely. The anal plates, on the other hand, were decidedly 

 variable. In the majority of cases these plates agree with Cope's 

 description: "three large scales, placed in a triangle, two posterior 

 to the other and with smaller scales behind." This arrangement 

 seems to be typical, but even in the comparatively small series from 

 the Okefinokee one specimen was found with only one anal plate, 

 four with two — one posterior to the other — one with three in a 

 longitudinal row, and several showed a wide granular space between 

 the plates and the vent. In other regions the plates are quite 

 uniform and agree well with the arrangements noted by Cope. 



The color is quite constant and the stripes persist through life, 

 never becoming obsolete. A faint brownish band, sometimes 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



double, is often found extending down the median dorsal line of the 

 body. The scales of the fore leg, hind leg and thighs are practically 

 without variation in the specimens studied. 



It might be noted that in many of the specimens recorded from 

 the Okefinokee the plate arrangement agrees much more nearly 

 with the figure and description of Cnemidophorus septemvitattus 

 Cope than with C. sexlineatus. This is noticeably true of the anal 

 plates, the general head structure and, in some cases, the femoral 

 pores. In fact, if the median dorsal longitudinal line which some- 

 times appears were more distinct, some of these specimens would 

 seem to merge into the typical septemvitattus. None of these speci- 

 mens, however, are as large as the type of septemvitattus (No. 2,872, 

 U. S. N. M.), nor do any show the colors of the unique specimen of 

 Cope's species, which appears quite distinct, resembling western 

 forms in general appearance and coloration, although the locality 

 given for the type specimen is denied by Van Denburgh,^^ and the 

 species does not seem to be as firmly established as might be wished. 

 14. Lygosoma laterale (Say). 



Not common. Only eight were taken in the swamp and but a 

 few others were seen. Of the eight specimens collected, one was 

 found under the bark of a log, one at the edge of a small stream, 

 almost in the water, one under leaves in the woods, and the rest 

 on the ground in open places. This species seemed comparatively 

 slow of movement and was not particularly difficult to capture. 



The specimens showed no peculiarities of markings or of plate 

 arrangement. The colors of the alcoholic specimens seemed to be 

 more or less obscured, but the dorsal surface usually retained the 

 characteristic bronze sheen, and the lateral stripes, although some- 

 what faded, were distinct. The ventral surface of the head and 

 pectoral region was normally yellowish-white, the throat and vent 

 lighter, the belly and under side of tail blue. The following note 

 taken of a living specimen in the field gives, perhaps, the most 

 accurate color description: 



Six rows ventral scales yellow from vent to fore limbs; chin 

 and gular region pinkish- white ; a row of yellow scales above yellow 

 ventral rows on either side; then five rows of dark-edged grayish 

 scales followed by a lateral black stripe; seven rows of reddish-brown 

 scales across the back. Reddish-brown of back marked off from 

 black lateral stripe by a thin reddish line. 



" Occasional papers. V. Cal. Acad, of Sciences, 1897, p. 133, note. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



The specimens were remarkably uniform in both comparative 

 and in actual measurements, the differences being chiefly in general 

 body and tail lengths, rather than in variation in size of limbs or in 

 distances between fixed points. 



In the discussion of the plates and scales of this species it should 

 be noted that Cope's description^^ is most unsatisfactory, the ter- 

 minology being confused, if not actually inaccurate. 



The description given by G. A. Boulenger in his Cat. Lizards Brit. 

 Mus., 1887, Vol. Ill, p. 263, proved the most useful and accurate. 



In the Okefinokee specimens the dorsal plates of the head are 

 absolutely uniform and may be described as follows: 



E-ostral short; internasal pentagonal; nostrils piercing nasals; 

 no supranasals; frontal in contact anteriorly with internasal, and 

 two prefrontals widely separated posteriorly from interparietal by 

 two broad frontoparietals; interparietal kite-shaped, much longer 

 than wide; parietals 2; supraorbitals 4; superciliaries 7; superior 

 labials 7. 



Little data were obtainable regarding the life history of Lygosoma 

 laterals. No eggs were found. 



13. Plestiodon quinquelineatus Linn. Fig. 4. 



Common throughout the higher portions of the swamp and on 

 the islands. Seemed to be particularly fond of deserted buildings 

 and chimneys where any such structures occurred, and often found 

 aloHg fences. The larger forms were called by the local names of 

 "red-headed scorpion" and "red-headed lizard," while the smaller 

 striped forms seemed to have no common local name, being probably 

 confused by the natives with Cnemidophorus sexlineatus Linn. 

 Plestiodon quinquelineatus was seldom seen on the ground or on the 

 trees, but was often found stretched out in the sun on dead logs, 

 stumps or fallen timber. 



Although this was one of the most common of the lizards noticed 

 in the Okefinokee, comparatively few specimens were collected on 

 account of the fact that their habits made it a difficult matter to 

 secure them, since they clashed into crevices and holes or darted 

 along the fences or into the brush on the least provocation. They 

 were abundant in the deserted log buildings on Billy's Island and 

 were seen in large numbers in and around the old, abandoned house 

 on Mixon's Hammock, where they scurried over the ruined floor and 

 over the decayed timbers of the walls, only to dart into the cracks

at the approach of the collector. In fact, had the object been the 

 securing of "tails" rather than lizards, the collecting would have 



been far more successful, since the small blue-tailed form, particularly, 



was prone to leave a tail wriggling in the collector's hand while its 



owner scurried to safety. 



Enough specimens were collected, however, to show practically 

 all of the stages usually recorded, from the small, black, brilliantly- 

 marked form with the clearly bifurcated median stripe to the large, 

 brown, red-headed stage with the plain brownish coloration, broad 

 head and obsolete bands: 



The specimens naturally varied much in size as well as in colora- 

 tion, the smallest taken being 92 mm. long while the largest measured 

 237 mm. The coloration of the ventral surface of the body and head 

 seemed to vary according to the colors shown by the dorsal region. 

 For example, in the distinctly five-lined form, in which the dorsal

surface was nearly black, the ventral surface of the head and throat 

 was usually tinged or mottled with blue, while in the older brown 

 specimens with the brown dorsum and red head, the sides of the 

 head generally showed a tinge of orange and the white of the under 

 surface was permeated with red or yellow rather than with blue. 

 The belly in both forms was usually bluish, with the plates around 

 the vent approaching white. Although the size varied considerably, 

 the relative length of the body parts was remarkably constant, 

 except in the width of the head, which is of course unusually broad 

 in the older males. 



The scale and plate arrangement of the Okefinokee specimens 

 varied but little. The supraorbitals usually showed six plates; 

 the superior marginal plates of the orbit nine, of which the middle 

 three or four were often very narrow; the superior labials seven or 

 eight, the most posterior being the largest. All of the specimens 

 but one, however, showed two large distinct occipital plates, rather 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



than the irregular arrangement figured by Cope.^^ One specimen — 

 the largest — agreed with Cope's specimen (No. 9,234, U. S. N. M.) 

 in this respect. A variation was also noted in the plates of the 

 mental region. Cope's figure (ibid.) shows two unpaired plates 

 posterior to the mental. Of the specimens taken in the swamp, 

 just half of the number collected conformed to this arrangement, 

 while the other half showed only one unpaired plate between the 

 mental and the first pair of inferior labials. 



It can hardly escape the notice of the herpetologist that these 

 peculiarities (the single postmental plate and the two occipital 

 plates) here noted as variations of P. quinquelineatus are, except 

 for the postnasal, among the chief structural characters usually 

 given for the species P. anthracinus Baird, and the single or double 

 postmental enters into Cope's four main divisions of the genus. 

 Normally, one would expect two postmentals in P. quinquelineatus, 

 and it so proves by examination of a large series of extra-Okefinokee 

 specimens from other parts of southeastern United States, but this 

 single postmental in the Okefinokee specimens is not limited to 

 small forms, as are most of the supposed species with single post- 

 mentals. The largest red-headed specimen (No. 6,339) has this 

 character, and another good-sized individual has only one post- 

 mental, but there is on one side of this plate the merest beginning 

 of a suture to suggest where the subdivision might come if it were 

 to be. We suppose Cope would be obliged to make these "post- 

 nasal — one postmental" specimens members of his first division, 

 in which he places his Bermudan species, E. lofigirostris, but we could 

 hardly grant such a solution, and this restricted collection of Oke- 

 finokee skinks prompts a doubt of the actual rank of E. longirostris 

 and possibly of E. anthracinus and E. pluvialis, or, in other words, 

 we have our specimens referable to two of Cope's four main groups 

 for the genus, and if the postnasal character be proven variable this 

 P. quinquelineatus may yet offer variants referable to the other two 

 divisions. Certainly, the status of the species of Plestiodon is in a 

 most unsatisfactory state at the present time. 



The species P. quinquelineatus ranges through a wide series of 

 coloration during life, particularly as pertains to the stripes and 

 markings. The same bands appear in some specimens as are found 

 in P. anthracinus, vnih. a difference only in colors and brilliancy. 

 Since the structural plate characters overlap, as has been noted 



13 Rept. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1898, p. 634, fig. 125. 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



above, the suggestion can hardly be avoided that if environment 

 and cHmate be considered as affecting markings, it may lead to a 

 reconsideration of the value of such a basis for specific distinctions. 



An interesting illustration of regeneration was found in one of the 

 specimens taken (No. 6,339) in which the tail had been injured 

 75 mm. from the vent and a new tail 65 mm. long regenerated. The 

 old tail, however, still persisted, and projected at almost right angles 

 to a distance of 10 mm. with a small shriveled stump on the end 

 suggestive of a spine or barb. 



Several of the specimens of Plestiodon quinquelineatus were infested 

 with red mites (Acarina), which appeared attached under the fore 

 legs. One individual had eight of these parasites under one fore 

 leg and twelve under the other. 



Crocodilia. 



16. Alligator mississippiensis Daudin. Plate II, fig. 1. 



The alligator was found to be extremely common throughout the 

 Okefinokee, and after the novelty of watching their interesting 

 habits had worn off, no particular attention was paid to them by 

 members of the party. Alligators were constantly being seen in all 

 parts of the swamp, and a short trip in any direction from Billy's 

 Island usually resulted in the noting of several specimens. Outside 

 of a few shot for their skins and those killed for food, no adults were 

 collected, as it would have been entirely impracticable to have 

 transported their heavy bodies out of the swamp. A number of 

 young were taken, and of these a half dozen or more were preserved. 



A trip down Billy's Lake, from Billy's Island to Mixon's Hammock, 

 was always the occasion for more or less sport in endeavoring to 

 approach the alligators as they lay on the banks, in following their 

 courses as they swam across the placid stretch of water, leaving 

 broad ripples in their wake, or in listening to the interesting vocal 

 gymnastics of the Lees as they endeavored by ''grunting" to induce 

 a specimen to rise to the surface. The reptiles were often seen 

 sunning themselves in the rank masses of vegetation, which lined 

 the shores and were not infrequently surprised at very close quarters 

 while they were swimming. 



Whoever has heard the bellowing of ''gators" on Big Water or on 

 Floyd's Island Prairie will ever remember it as one of his most distinct 

 memories of the swamp and need ask for little else more blood 

 stirring or thrilling upon first acquaintance. The Lees claim the 

 young ones can bellow nearly as loud as the older ones and that they 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



distinguish them by the intervals, which are much shorter in the 

 3'ounger ones. Mr. Harper saw a five-foot aUigator at the north 

 edge of the swamp with his jaws tied with a cord which for several 

 days it could not break. liater he observed that Bryant Lee could 

 hold shut the two jaws of a wounded "gator." 



Since these animals were found in every part of the swamp, no 

 mention of particular localities is of importance. They were most 

 abundant, perhaps, in Billy's Lake, in Floyd's Island and Honey 

 Island Prairies and in the head waters of the Suwanee River. 

 " 'Gator holes," however, were to be seen in all waters deep enough 

 to afford seclusion for the animals. These holes ranged in size 

 from a few feet across to large areas extending from 25 to 75 yards^ 

 in diameter. Throughout the swamp and in the prairies, also, were 

 long open tracts in which no water-lilies grew, and these were pro- 

 nounced by the natives to be " 'gator trails." 



The methods of hunting the alligator, as practised by the Lees- 

 and other inhabitants of the region, consist mainly of going out at 

 night in small boats and locating the animals by means of a lamp- 

 fastened to the head of one hunter in the bow of the boat. Another 

 hunter in the stern paddles or poles and uses the sharp end of the 

 push pole to "stick" the body after the animal has been shot and 

 has sunk to the bottom. According to these hunters, who every 

 year take but a large number of skins, the eyes of the small alligators 

 appear red by the light thus used, while those of the large specimens 

 are yellow. The hunter carrying the light swings his head from side 

 to side through an arc of 180 degrees, and when an alligator is sighted 

 shoots it by the light of the lamp on his head. The common sup- 

 position that the skin of an alligator will turn the bullet of a gun is, 

 of course, unfounded. Since, however, only the head of the animal 

 is usually exposed when it is in the water, they are commonly shot 

 through the eyes. The hunters generally use a shotgun loaded 

 with buckshot. That a large number of alligators are annually 

 secured in this manner is evidenced by the fact that the fields of 

 the Lees are strewn with the skeletons and dorsal strips of skin which 

 have been thrown away after each expedition. Only the ventral 

 part of the skin is saved, the upper portions being too thick and 

 spiny to admit of the primitive methods of tanning, and therefore 

 the crest and dorsal scales are not retained. 



Plenty of evidence was secured to prove that the alligator is a 

 formidable antagonist when in the water. The powerful tail is the 

 chief weapon of defence, and with it the animal can deal a terrifie 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



blow. On June 13, 1912, a large-sized alligator was seen to slowly 

 sink below the surface as several members of the party in a small 

 boat were making a trip on Minne Lake. Bryant Lee "grunted" 

 the animal to the surface, where it was shot, but not killed. It 

 rose within a foot or two of the boat and performed a most remarkable 

 series of spinning movements, revolving rapidly on its tail with its 

 body directly upright and the head out of the water. Several shots 

 and repeated blows of the paddle were required before it finally 

 sank. 



The alligators of the Okefinokee showed no variation, so far as our 

 observations went, from the ordinary form of A. mississippiensis, 

 which has been sufficiently well described by various authors to 

 make a description in this record unnecessary. The young which 

 were preserved agree also with the published descriptions and are 

 most brilliantly marked in the smaller specimens. As the animal 

 increases in age, the fifteen transverse yellow bands become fainter 

 and the dorsal crest more pronounced. In the very young specimens 

 the dorsal tubercles of the neck are entirely absent. 



No nests of eggs were found, but a number of eggs were taken 

 from the bodies of those killed. In one specimen (No. 6,493) were 

 found twenty mature eggs, ready for depositing. These eggs have 

 completely formed shells which are thin and soft, not brittle, and 

 grajdsh-white in color, with a granular coating which rubs off on 

 handling. The average length of these eggs is 3 inches and the 

 average diameter If inches. From a female 8| feet long, taken on 

 Billy's Lake, June 11, 1912, were taken 42 embryonic eggs ranging 

 in size from J to If inches in diameter, almost spherical and of a 

 dark orange color. The skin of these eggs is soft and smooth and 

 covered with shreds of connective tissue. With this female was a 

 large male about 11 feet long. 



Both the eggs and the flesh of the alligator are eaten by the inhabi- 

 tants of the swamp, and the tails of the young proved to be a very 

 acceptable article of diet. The meat is firm and white and in taste 

 somewhat resembles that of pike. 



One alligator was taken by Mr. John Needham on Billy's Lake 

 in December, 1913, but this was the only specimen seen on the trip 

 made at that time. Evidently, however, the alligators do not 

 entirely disappear even during that season of the year. 

 17. Crocodilus americanus Laurenti. 



No crocodiles were found in the Okefinokee. Nevertheless, there 

 is a persistent idea throughout the region of the swamp that these 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



animals have been seen in its waters and are still occasionally to 

 be encountered, although the evidence offered is very meagre and the 

 descriptions given of the so-called crocodiles are far from satisfactory. 



The natives describe the crocodile as being much darker in color 

 than the alligator and state that in the crocodile the upper jaw is 

 movable instead of the lower. This latter notion, it may be ob- 

 served, is common throughout this part of the country, and is insisted 

 upon by many hunters, although the basis for the idea is n3t evident. 

 On the other hand, the chief points of scientific distinction between 

 the two animals is never touched upon by those who profess to have 

 seen the crocodile, and even such striking differences as the longer 

 snout and the more active movements of the latter animal appear 

 never to have been noticed. 



Bryant Lee states that crocodiles have been taken in the region 

 around Cow House, but that he has never seen one south of Honey 

 Island. Joe Saunders insists that he has seen crocodiles in a creek 

 flowing into the Suwanee River in Clinch County, while Jackson Lee 

 says that he knows of at least two crocodiles being taken in Billy's 

 Lake. These hunters, when pressed for details, state that the chief 

 distinctive character of the crocodile is the color of its eyes, which 

 they describe as red or orange, and the much darker color of the body. 



These men have spent their lives in the swamp and are remarkably 

 close observers, and it is evident that the form which they have in 

 mind is in some way different from the common alligator, but it 

 seems unlikely that it is Crocodilus americanus. 



II. SNAKES. 



BY A. H. WRIGHT AND S. C. BISHOP. 



No State in the United States has furnished more distinctive and 

 peculiar snakes and no area has received more herpetological atten- 

 tion than Florida, yet none of these numerous ophidian collectors 

 and students has ever entered Okefinokee at Florida's northern 

 border. The nearest approach came about twenty-five years ago 

 in the visit of the ornithologist, Mr. C. F. Batchelder, of Cambridge, 

 Mass. He spent a day or two on Mitchell and Black Jack Islands. 

 To the eastward, at St. Mary's, Ga., and at Fernandina, Fla., he 

 took the following si3ecies: 



Cijclophis wstivus, Osceola doliata doliata, 



Osceola elapsoidea, Ophibolus getulus getulus. 



In Florida, at Gainesville, the snakes secured by James Bell in 




140 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mar., 



1879, July, 1880, and April 7-18, 1882, prove most instructive, for 

 this locality is not far south of Bay Swamp, the Floridan extension 

 of the Okefinokee Swamp. Mr. Bell has the following list: 



Osceola elapsoidea, 

 Ophibolus getuliis getulus, 

 Natrix fasciata fasciata, 

 Natrix fasciata pictiventris, 

 Natrix fasciata sipedon, 

 Natrix fasciata erythrogaster, 

 Eutcenia sackenii, 

 Elaps fulvius,* 

 Ancistrodon contortrix,* 

 Crotcdus adamanteus. 



Abastor erythrogrammus,* 

 Farancia abacura, 

 Heterodon platyrhinus, 

 Heterodon simus* 

 Cyclophis cestivus, 

 Zamenis constrictor, 

 Zamenis flagellum, * 

 Coluber quadrivittatus, 

 Compsosoma corais couperii* 

 Pityophis melanoleucus, * 

 Osceola doliata parallela, 



Of the above 22 species, seven (with asterisks) are not in our list. 

 All of these seven we might expect in southeastern Georgia, and 

 were in our working hypothetical list before the trip was taken. 

 They represent the remaining Austroriparian forms which were not 

 taken by us, and with the truly Floridan peninsular snakes almost 

 complete the whole list of southeastern United States forms. Fur- 

 thermore, these seven (with Abastor erythrogrammus, a mud and 

 aquatic snake eliminated from consideration) represent the assem- 

 blage of southeastern species which most prefer the dry pine forests 

 of the Atlantic coast or dry open or sandy fields where the gopher 

 turtle occurs. We have no doubt that these seven occur on the 

 Atlantic seaboard to the immediate east of Okefinokee and also in 

 its outskirts. In fact, the natives held that there were several 

 kinds of snakes outside the swamp which were not within it, and, 

 among these, they named the coachwhip snake. Besides, the 

 gopher turtle, the associate form of the above seven, occurs outside 

 the swamp, but not within it. 



To the northwest about forty miles, at Nashville and Alapaha, 

 Ga., William J. Taylor, from July 19 to November 18, 1881, took 

 seven species of snakes, of which Elaps fulvius does not appear in 

 our list. The seven are: 



Sistr urns miliar i us , 

 Ophibolus getulus getulus, 

 Elaps fulvius. * 



Farancia abacura, 

 Heterodon platyrhinus, 

 Haldea striatula, 

 Natrix fasciata sipedon, 



In addition to these collections from Messrs. C. F. Batchelcler, 

 J. Bell and W. J. Taylor, Cope also had material from St. Simon's 

 Island. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



In the earlier days, Holbrook received some material from the 

 region to the eastward of the swamp (vide Tropidonotus taxispilotus) .2*' 

 In another place (Vol. IV, p. vi), he writes: "J. Hamilton Couper, 

 Esq., of St. Simon's Island, Georgia, has also furnished me with 

 several Serpents of that state; and to him I owe a knowledge of 

 the Gopher Snake, perhaps the largest and most beautiful of our 

 Serpents." Of this form, Mr. Couper says :^^ "I have only seen it 

 in the dry pine hills, south of the Alatamaha; and I have never 

 met with it in the low grounds even of the same vicinity." This 

 may explain its absence in the Okefinokee. In this connection, it 

 is interesting to observe that the same seven absent forms (except 

 Compsosoma corais couperii) occur in Dr. Holbrook's Catalogue-^ ■ 

 of the Ophidia of Georgia. In it 33 species of snakes are listed. In 

 C. S. Brimley's^s Records of Some Reptiles and Batrachians from 

 the Southeastern United States we find 21 species recorded from 

 Georgia. Five (Compsosoma corais couperii and Ahastor erythro- 

 grammus being absent) of the seven species missing from Okefinokee 

 are given in his list as taken either at Riceboro to the northeast or 

 at Mimsville to the west. 



In 1871 and 1876, Paul Fountain visited this area and he writes i^"* 



"I can assure the lover of Nature, if he is prepared to run the risk 

 •of fever, that the farther he forces his way into its gloomy depths, 

 the more remarkable and beautiful will be the forms of animal and 

 vegetable life he will discover." Later he says: "A greater 

 number of reptiles may be found in this swamp than in any other 

 spot I know of in the States." And he reserves his discussion and 

 digression on snakes in general for his chapter on A Day in a Cypress 

 Swamp (Okefinokee). 



In 1888, Cope published On the Snakes of Florida,^° and this 

 paper has considerable bearing on some of the Okefinokee species; 

 but, inasmuch as it is embraced in Cope's great work,^^ The Croco- 

 dilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North America, we will not consider 

 it in detail. In 1896, the next list of some pertinence is Remarks 

 on Some of the Floridan Snakes, by Charles B. Cor^-.-^ He enumer- 

 ates 15 of the commoner species of this State.

[Mar., 



From September, 1892, to July, 1893, Prof. Einar Loennberg,^® 

 of University of Upsala, Sweden, was engaged in collecting in Florida 

 and his Notes, etc., published in 1895, proves one of the most 

 important herpetological papers on southeastern United States in 

 the last quarter of a century. He secured 30 species of snakes. 

 Nine of his 30 species are not represented in our collections, three 

 being genera peculiar to Florida, one, TantUla coronata, occurring 

 in Georgia as well, not being recorded, however, from the Okefinokee 

 Swamp, and five proving of the same assemblage as Bell's seven 

 (Gainesville) species missing from the Okefinokee Swamp, because 

 they are more especiall}^ dry pine land forms. 



The 21 species taken in the swamp represent a distinctly Austro- 

 riparian element which does not entirely shun moisture. The 

 collection of 165 individuals apportioned numerically among the 

 21 different species of snakes indicates very roughly the degree of 

 abundance on Billy's Island or its immediate environs. The list follows : 



Heterodon platyrhinus 38

Haldea striatula 1 



None of Cope's (1900, p. 1207) four pecuhar snake genera {Stilosoma, 

 Seminatrix, Rhadinea and Liodytes) of the Floridan region enter the 

 swamp, and none of the Floridan sauria, unless the other limbless 

 lizard described by the Lees proves to be Rhineura. One lone speci- 

 men of Hijla gratiosa of the amphibians was taken, and, with the 

 birds, there is a Floridan tendency, but it is not very pronounced. 

 Of the above 21 snakes, Thamnophis s. sackenii of Cope's Floridan 

 snakes occurs in the swamp, and there are forms which might be 

 termed T. compressicaudus and T. f. pictiventris. 



The largest portion of the Okefinokee material in this report 

 represents the collection made by the Cornell University expedition 

 during the summer of 1912 (May 28-July 13). The party included

Profs. J. C. Bradley and C. R. Crosby, of the Department of Ento- 

 mology; Dr. A. H. Wright, of the Department of Zoology; Head- 

 master W. D. Funkhouser, of the Ithaca High School; Messrs. 

 S. C. Bishop and M. D. Leonard, of the class of 1913, and Paul 

 Battle, of Bainbridge, Ga. During the first week, Mr. E. L. 

 Worsham, State Entomologist of Georgia, and Mr. C. S. Spooner, 

 Assistant State Entomologist, were also with the party. Later, 

 from July 15 to November 1, 1912, the Lees judiciously collected 

 material which added four species to our list and nicely augmented 

 our series of previously known forms. In the fall of 1913, Prof. J. C. 

 Bradley and Paul Battle spent a week on Billy's Island and brought 

 out a few reptiles. In December, 1913, Profs. J. G. Needham and J. C. 

 Bradley, Messrs. John Needham and Paul Battle made a trip of ten 

 days into' the Okefinokee and collected considerable data on the winter 

 conditions. Some of their material they brought out, but they left a 

 container which was filled by the Ijees by August 1, 1914. This collec- 

 tion has not been received and is not incorporated in this report. All 

 the members of these various parties and, particularly Prof. Bradley, 

 collected snake material and data and, to each of them we are deeply 

 indebted for aid, good communal spirit and material encouragement. 

 Acknowledgments are due Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, of the United 

 States National Museum; Dr. Witmer Stone and Mr. H. W. Fowler, 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, for the privilege 

 of examining types in their respective collections, and to Messrs. 

 R. W. Bennett and Cornelius, of Fargo, Ga., without whose courteous 

 assistance it would have been impossible to have transported our 

 material out of the swamp. 



The Lees proved very efficient collectors. They enjoy life in 

 this naturalist's paradise and do not live in constant fear of the 

 numerous venomous snakes and dangerous animals of the swamp. 

 They do not alter their course in life because of them, though they 

 respect and appreciate the danger and know what bad wounds some 

 can inflict. They bathe in the lakes where many accidents might 

 befall them, but usually do not. The children go barefoot and were 

 our best and most vigilant scouts about the Lees' clearing. Many 

 a snake, both large and small, they ''stepped on," if they did not 

 "cromb " it with a stick. They knew not the noose, and to it we had 

 little recourse except on rare occasions. The gun proved very 

 serviceable in the thickets. The Lees' fields and clearing were the 

 resort of turtles, lizards and oviparous snakes which sought them 

 for breeding purposes. 




144 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



Hither, as in other parts of the swamp, the bears, raccoons, opos- 

 sums and other mammals come for the eggs buried in the sand. 

 Over this same ground the king snake, black snake and pilot snake 

 search for the same quarry and the reptiles which lay the eggs. 

 The natives have a very good idea of the economic value of the 

 various snakes and spare most of them, except the truly poisonous 

 forms and what they call the "Water" and "Highland Moccasins" 

 {Tropidonotus and Thamnophis). One of the many roles which the 

 natives accredit the black and turkey vultures is that of enemies of 

 snakes and some birds of prey, e.g., the Buteos engage in the same 

 practice. The snakes also suffer from the herons, ibises and cranes, 

 but with these the reptiles are a second choice when frogs and toads 

 are available. 



The number of snakes with internal parasites is surprisingly 

 large, 37 of the 165 being thus afflicted, or 8 of the 21 species. They 

 are: 



Heterodon platyrhinus 14 Thamnophis s. sackeni 2 



Ancistrodon piscivorus 6 Lampropeltis getuliis 1 



Coluber constrictor 5 Sistrurus miliarius 1 



Tropidonotus taxispilotus 5 



Thamnophis s. ordinatus 3 37 



No doubt, other species also suffer, for this list represents the 

 species of which we had the largest series. The above species are 

 about equally distributed between the terrestrial and aquatic groups. 

 In number, the former are 24 and the latter 13; but, if the spreading 

 adder be eliminated, the terrestrial forms lead by 3. It is a significant 

 fact that the species which are the worst sufferers are also inveterate 

 feeders on toads and frogs of all kinds, and it is quite possible that 

 these nematodes and other parasites reach the snakes through their 

 food. 



According to habitat, these snakes may be divided as follows: 



Islands. 



Heterodon platyrhinus, Elaphe ohsoletus. 



Coluber constrictor, Opheodrys cestivus, 



Lamprojjeltis getulus, Diadophis punctatus, 



Crotalus adamanteus, Elaphe guttatus, 



Crotalus horridus, Storeria dekayi,

If these snakes be considered from the point of view of locomotion, 

 they fall into the same four groups which Loennberg (1895, pp. 

 336, 337) made, and the snakes are quite similarly, but not absolutely, 

 arranged as he found them :

Or, viewed from the standpoint of breeding, they are about equally- 

 divided: the poisonous snakes, Tropidonotus, Thamtiophis, Storeria 

 and Haldea, being ovoviviparous, and all the rest oviparous. 



Finally, if the Okefinokee snakes be grouped according to food, 

 based largely on stomach contents, but also on observations of the 

 haunt, time of activity in the swamp and on the keen knowledge 

 of the natives, these snakes are arranged as follows: 



E. ohsoletus, 

 L. getidus, 

 C. constrictor, 

 S. miliarius, 

 C. adamanteus, 



C. constrictor, 

 S. miliarius,

0. cestivus. 



It is apparent at once that. insects, etc., prove the important food 

 of the smaller snakes, ten of the 21 species falling in this group and 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 147 



only one of the larger snakes being in this category. Doubtless, 

 all the 21 species will eat insects to a certain extent. The species 

 which are almost exclusive insect feeders are Haldea striatula, Sto- 

 reria occipitomaculata, Storeria dekayi and Opheodrys cestivus. The 

 reader must bear in mind throughout this discussion we are treating 

 Okefinokee snakes and not the species throughout its entire range. 



With the larger snakes, the food most generally sought is Anura 

 or Amphibia in general. It is par excellence the food of the aquatic 

 snakes, and with these four or five species it usually is some species 

 of Rana, though Acris, Chorophiliis or Hyla may rarely appear as 

 their prey. Equally important are frogs in the food of the larger 

 land snakes, 5 species being addicted to them. With these the 

 southern and oak toads (Bufo) are easily of first importance, with the 

 tree frogs (Hyla) and the narrow-mouthed frog (Engystoma) occupy- 

 ing second and third places. In fact, these 10 snakes prefer the 

 soft-bodied frogs and toads to any other food of the swamp (reptilian 

 eggs not considered), and if they were to be restricted to any one of 

 these categories they belong to this group. 



Fish enter into the food economy of all the aquatic species, the 

 bream and killifishes proving the common bait. L. d. coccineus 

 ate fish, as doubtless some of the island forms do when the smaller 

 fish become cut off in landlocked pools on the islands. 



In general, the lizards are swift (except the ground lizard), and 

 fall prey only to some of the swifter coursers of the islands. How- 

 ever, at least 5 species ate them or their eggs. The turtles when 

 young and soft are occasionally taken by the moccasins and possiblj' 

 by the other aquatic snakes, the young soft-shelled turtles {Platy- 

 peltis ferox) being the species most attacked. On the land, the 

 turtles' eggs are eaten by at least 2 species, if not by many more. 

 This source of food is one of the commonest of the swamp for man, 

 mammals and snakes. At least one-third of the species are canni- 

 balistic and will eat snakes, either adults or young, or eggs. 



The warm-blooded groups, birds and mammals, suffer from the 

 same foes. Seven species of the largest snakes of the swamp assail 

 them, their eggs or young. Four of these seven are the four poisonous 

 snakes of the swamp, while the other three are the pilot, black and 

 king snakes. In addition, the mammals have an inveterate foe in 

 the corn snake, which apparently does not molest birds. None of 

 these seven or eight species are aquatic but one, the moccasin. 



The three omnivorous coursers on the islands are the king snake, 

 pilot snake and the black snake, while in the water the only snake 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



which includes insects in its diet to any extent is the southern riband 

 snake. One must be impressed with the immense abundance of the 

 reptihan forms, the restricted island quarters for these reptiles and 

 the need of great numbers to keep each species existent under such 

 strenuous vicissitudes. Each form, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird 

 or mammal, has untold foes which are close at hand, fellow-travellers 

 of the same course and seekers of the same breeding grounds already 

 crowded. Never have we been so struck with the incessant warfare 

 of primeval nature as on these islands of the Okefinokee. 



Another very interesting fact is the isolated nature of the place 

 where these 165 snakes were taken. They are virtually a collection 

 of Billy's Island ophidians with a few other islands and portions 

 of the swamp represented. Our series of each species becomes, 

 therefore, very significant if several variants appear. They cannot 

 be designated as geographical subspecies or varieties and must be 

 considered only as indicating the inherent range of variation which 

 a species may manifest in one limited geographical region, not what 

 might appear in an extensive or expansive stretch of territory. 

 Hence, the value of the material, though not as numerous as might 

 be desired. 



Without doubt, many of the conclusions and observations in this 

 paper are not new and are only corroborative of previous work, but 

 they may have interest because of their independent nature. The 

 more significant conclusions are: 



1. That Tropidonotus fasciatus and most of its subspecies, T. 

 compressicaudus, T. ustus, T. bisectus and T. rhomhifera, need to be 

 restudied before they can be finally accepted. 



2. That Elaphe obsoletus confinis, E. o. lemniscatus, E. spiloides, 

 E. Icetus and E. quadrivittatiis are too closely intergradient to be so 

 distinctly designated. 



3. That LampropeUis getulus getulus, L. g. sayi and L. g. splendidus- 

 are possibly variations within one region. 



4. That Thamnophis sirtalis ordinatus is the color form of the 

 Okefinokee, though its recognition as a good subspecies may be 

 questionable. 



5. That LampropeUis d. coccineus and Osceola elapsoidea are to be 

 considered one and the same. 



6. That Diadophis a. stictogenys is not deserving of separation 

 from Diadophis punctatus. 



7. That Farancia ahacura may have white-bellied forms as well 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 149 



as those with the typical red ventral coloration, and that this albin- 

 istic character is not solely an adult or young variation. 



8. That our specimens of Heterodon platyrhinus are one-third 

 plafyrhinus, one-third intermediate and one-third niger; that possibly 

 7iiger is an adult end phase, and that one platyrhinus specimen agrees 

 perfectly with Heterodon brownii Stejneger,- both in the absence of 

 the azj^gous plate and in coloration. 



9. That the two specimens of Storeria dekayi have not 17, but 

 15 rows of scales, like S. occipitomaculata, and one of the two speci- 

 mens has the oculars not 1-2, but 2-2, as usual in the red-bellied 

 species, the lone representative of which has the ocular formula 3-2. 



10. That the range of the southern ribbon snake, T. s. sackeni, 

 is not restricted on the Atlantic coast to Florida. 



11. That C. horridus of the Okefinokee is distinctly the light 

 canebrake form of this species. 



1. Faraucia abacura (Holbrook): Horn Snake; Red-bellied Snake; Hoop Snake; Rainbow 

 Snake; Mud Snake; Checkered Snake. 



Three specimens were taken, and from native accounts it appar- 

 ently is fairly common, but hard to secure. In distribution this 

 species reaches from Virginia to Florida and from Indiana and 

 Illinois to Louisiana and rarely into Texas. The nearest records 

 are from AUapaha, Ga., to the northwest, and from Gainesville, 

 Fla., to the direct south. 



Coloration. — The horn snake is one of the most beautiful snakes 

 of North America. The ground color is a blue-black, the smooth 

 and shining scales have an enamelled surface, and the gastrosteges 

 and the scales along the sides have a fluted appearance. Every 

 labial, mental and gular plate has a blue-black spot in its middle. 

 The color of the back extends to the gastrosteges in vertical bars or 

 inverted triangles, the apices being on the gastrosteges. Usually, 

 at each one of these apices appears an oblong spot, and in the cephalic 

 half of the body, the venter, as a result, presents a row of these 

 spots on either end of the gastrosteges, thus giving a distinct light- 

 colored band down the middle. In the caudal half of the body the 

 vertical bars of opposite sides usually meet or alternate on the 

 mid-ventral line, producing a checkered appearance. The vertical 

 black bars are two scales wide at the end of the gastrosteges and 

 three or four scales wide on the 4th row of scales. The lighter 

 intervals between the dark bars are two scales wide at the end of 

 the gastrosteges and one wide at the 4th row of scales. Each gular 

 gastrostege has a black band across it. 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



The lighter color of the venter extends to the 4th row of scales 

 in the younger specimens. In these, usually at the neck of the 

 light interval, there appears one or two blue-black spots to suggest 

 the almost complete invasion of the body color upon these areas in 

 the large specimens where the light areas seldom reach the 2d row 

 of scales and where there are large central black spots on the scales. 

 Our specimens have 63, 64 and 65 light vertical bars or wedges, 

 respectively, or from 50-53 from the anus forward. Curiously 

 enough, the two specimens which we first took alive, one 151.7 cm. 

 long and the other 43 cm., were ivhite beneath, and not red. The 

 other preserved specimen has also the whitish appearance. Two 

 of the specimens in alcohol may possibly have a slight tinge of 

 pinkish, but it is faint if present at all; surely, it is not yellow. These 

 three white-bellied Farancias are noteworthy. H. H. Brimley^* 

 took a large white-bellied adult male, which was coiled with a normal 

 male and female in coitu, but our specimens, however, are not all 

 adults, one being only 43 cm., the largest, 151.7 cm., and another 

 intermediate 81.1 cm. The native present when we caught the 

 largest specimen asserted that he had seen red-bellied forms of this 

 snake, and, in December, 1913, Profs. Needham and Bradley saw. a 

 beautiful red-bellied individual of this species. 



Dimensions and Variatio7is. — The gastrosteges were 194, 195 and 

 196, respectively, in our three specimens; the urosteges, 39, 39, 42; 

 the scales 19-19-19; supralabials 7; eye over 3d and 4th supralabial; 

 infralabials 8; loreal elongate; temporals 1-2; nasal with groove 

 below nostril; in C. U., No. 6,108, a groove above the nostril as well; 

 anal plate and the gastrostege before it divided; in the caudal half 

 of the body 6 or 8 rows of scales on the dorsum with a suggestion 

 of a keel on them. 



Habits. — The largest specimen (No. 6,108) was taken in a dark 

 cypress thicket (between Billy's and Gallberry Islands), wherein a 

 Florida barred owl had retreated. In water ankle deep or more 

 our guide accidentally stepped on the snake, thinking it at first a 

 moccasin. He recoiled and then quickly shot it. The smallest 

 specimen (No. 6,107) was secured in the most difficult tangle (Minne 

 Lake trail to Minne Lake Islands) of the whole swamp, where the mag- 

 nificent cypress trees and associated undergrowth were thickest. On 

 a mat of sphagnum it rested, and when alarmed quickly shot down 



23 Brimley, C. S. Zoology of Lake Ellis, N. C, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., Vol. XXII, 

 1909, p. 134. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



into it. Our first hold of this snake was not secure and it as quickly 

 began burrowing the second time. From all that we observed of 

 the living snakes of this species we would consider them timid, 

 harmless burrowers. They are decidedly inhabitants of the twilight 

 parts of the swamp, and their eyes suggest such a habitat. If found 

 during the day, they appear in the dark, gloomy cypress ponds on 

 the islands or amongst the dense vegetation of the deepest and 

 most inaccessible regions of the swamp. We discovered no par- 

 ticular superstitions regarding its horny tip. It is curious to find 

 the hill hoop-rolling story also associated with this species, which 

 to my mind is one of our most aquatic species, and the names 

 "cypress" or "sphagnum" snake would be equally appropriate with 

 some of the names suggested by its structures. 



Food and Breeding. — None of the specimens had food in their 

 alimentary tract and no parasites were found. The natives relate 

 how the thunder snake (L. gelulus) digs beneath rotten logs and other 

 cover for the adults and young of this species. Of the breeding 

 habits of this oviparous form we know little. The natives assert 

 that the progeny of one female sometimes reaches 40 to 43. 



2. Diadophis punctatus (Linnseus): Ring-necked Snake. Plate III, fig. 1. Fig. 5. 



This species is probably fairly common on the islands of the 

 swamp. Three specimens were secured on Billy's Island between 

 June 11 and 15, 1912. 



Coloration. — All three specimens are bluish-black or brown above, 

 the color extending on to the end of each gastrostege. These black 

 spots on either extremity appear as a row on each side of the venter. 

 In No. 6,105 they are very obscure on the neck region. In all three 

 the dorsal scales are with pale edges and with numerous fine light 

 specks. In No. 6,104 the edges of the dorsal scales are opalescent. 

 In No. 6,106 there is a median row of body-colored spots down the 

 venter to the anus, all the urosteges and gastrostege No. 2 being 

 without spots; the same applies to No. 6,105 with the urosteges and 

 gastrosteges Nos. 1-5, 8 unspotted; in No. 6,104, the median row is 

 very interrupted, no spots being on gastrosteges Nos. 1-20, except 

 No. 3, and none beyond No. 133, while between Nos. 21-133 there 

 are several missing. In No. 6,105, the nuchal half collar is 1-2 

 scales wide; in No. 6,106 it is the same width, but interrupted by a 

 median dorsal row of black scales, while in No. 6,104 it is faint 

 except on the lower sides. In No. 6,105, the mental and labial 

 regions are almost immaculate, a few infralabials being with faint 

 black spots; in No. 6,104, each infralabial is weh marked with one 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



or more black spots as the symphyseal is; in No. 6,106, the geneials 

 as well have these spots. 



Dimensions and Variations. —ThQ total length of these three 

 snakes reaches from 19.5-29 cm.; the tail from 4.7-5.8 cm. or 4|-5j 

 in the total length; the gastrosteges are 143-150; the urosteges, 

 39-46; anal divided, and in one the gastrostege ahead is also divided. 

 Tail very spike-like and sharp. Scales 15-15-15; temporals 1-1; 

 oculars 1-2 in No. 6,106, the preocular large on the right side and 

 small on the left side, the prefrontal taking the place of the normal 

 iipper preocular, 2-2, in Nos. 6,104 and 6,105. The supralabials in 

 No. 6,106 are 8, with the eye resting on the 4th and 5th; in No. 

 6,105 on the right side they are 8, with eye on the 4th and 5th, while 

 on the left side there are 7, with the eye on the 3d and 4th; in No. 

 6,104 there are 7 supralabials on each side, the eye being over the 

 3d and 4th on each side. In Nos. 6,105, 6,106 the supralabials 

 have the clear band of ventral color, but in No. 6,104 this color is 

 heavily encroached upon by black.

Fig. 5. — Diadophis punctatus (Linn.) 



In view of Cope's establishment of D. amabilis stictogenys upon 

 three specimens from New Orleans, Pearl River, Miss., and Savannah, 

 Ga., the last locality not far from Okefinokee Swamp, our three 

 specimens prove interesting. To find these three showing such a 

 gamut of differences is rather fortunate. Our specimen No. 6,104 

 is almost a duplicate of Cope's D. a. stictogenys. It has 7 supra- 

 labials, a speckled gular and labial region and the eye resting on the 

 3d and 4th supralabial; liut like his specimen, the three abdominal 

 rows of ventral spots, the 150 gastrosteges and other characters 

 suggest D. punctatus. It was taken under the same log as an almost 

 immaculate-chinned D. punctatus, Avhich has 8 supralabials on the 

 right side and eye on the 4th and 5th and 7 supralabials on the 

 left side and eye over 3d and 4th. No. 6,106, captured in a similar 

 habitat, is a good D. punctatus in scutellation, but has the gular and 

 labial regions spotted as in Cope's subspecies. The numerous 

 variations in these three specimens, the circumstances of their 

 capture, the isolated character of their habitat (Billy's Island), an 

 inspection of Cope's type and Dr. vStejneger's previous decision and 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 153 



concurrence (study of Diadophis in manuscript) — all force the 

 authors to consider this subspecies untenable. 



Habits. — This attractive snake was found during the day under 

 cover, usually under logs near the cypress edges of Billy's Island. 

 It seemed to prefer localities near the edge of the thicker woods. 

 In one case it was under a log in a place near and exactly similar to 

 the situation described for Haldea striatula. In the other instance, 

 the two were taken (June 11, 1912) under a log near Billy's Island 

 landing at the woody edge of cultivated fields. The D. a. stidogenys 

 specimen was first taken and a few minutes later the other specimen 

 was found under the same log. The former may have been seeking 

 -the sandy fields of the Lees where lizards, snakes and turtles resort 

 in great numbers to lay their eggs. This specimen had six unlaid 

 eggs which measured as follows: 18 x 9 mm., 19 x 9, 19 x 9, 20 x 9, 

 20 X 9, 21 x 10. The covering is thin and quite pinkish in alcohol. 

 This species seems as nocturnal in Okefinokee as our experiences 

 with it elsewhere suggest. These specimens had insect and worm 

 remains in their alimentary tracts.

 ing Viper; Blowing Adder; Blow Snake; Blowing Viper; Spotted Adder; Flatheaded 

 Adder; Pufif Adder; Sand Viper; Black Viper. Plate III, fig. 7; fig. 6. 



Thirty-eight specimens were secured, of which 16 were young 

 snakes; one was a cast skin. 



Coloration. — In coloration our series show all possible patterns. 

 The 16 young were all of the spotted phase and manifested the 

 following pattern: The ground color may be yellowish, brownish 

 or reddish. Down the back is a series of 26-32 spots and on the 

 tail 7-9 spots which become transverse bands. The color around 

 these dorsal spots is brighter or lighter than the surrounding body 

 color. Alternating with and almost touching the corners of the 

 dorsal spots is a series of lateral spots. In the cephalic region, one 

 of these spots of each side with a pair of successive dorsal spots form 

 a quartette — an arrangement soon lost in the caudal part of the 

 body and seldom seen in adults. Beneath these spots may be seen 

 one or more series of small spots, not very distinct in form. The 

 venter is grayish or greenish-white, heavily blotched with black or 

 brownish. The head has a black bar connecting the upper anterior 

 edges of the orbits; another bar from the eye to the angle of the 

 mouth ; and a third, on occipital plates, posterior margins of supra- 

 orbitals and frontal. This black spot has a backward extension on 

 either side of the nape or neck and usually a small median extension 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



just back of the occipital plates. Often this median prolongation 

 is cut off and surrounded by body color. Usually on the occipital 

 suture and occipitofrontal suture appears a light spot. 



In some of the adults the same schema of coloration obtains as 

 in the young, except that dorsal and lateral spots are less distinct 

 as such and become more transverse areas with light intervals. 

 Furthermore, the supralabials are more prominently spotted in the 

 young. 



Of the 21 specimens of adults, 8 were of the black (niger) type 

 with slaty-gray below. In most of these 8 the gular scales and 

 whole chin except in two become the darkest portion of the whole 

 venter. Of the spotted forms (platyrhinus) , we had a few with the 

 brick-red on the head and neck and somewhat on the body. In the 

 intermediates, the approach to the black phase begins in the head 

 region and the head first becomes black, or it and the neighboring 

 cephalic region. In this process the transverse light intervals 

 remain brightest and persist longest in the tail region. Some of the 

 specimens are almost niger in the cephalic region, but platyrhiyius 

 in the caudal half, or three-quarters niger with the scales of the light 

 intervals of the caudal region with incoming black centres. About 

 7 of the adults were true spotted adders and 6 intermediate. Thus, 

 of the adults we have an almost equal division of 7 spotted, 6 inter- 

 mediates and 8 blacks. Most of our largest specimens were black 

 or fast approaching that stage. The black seems to be an end phase 

 of size or age, possibly not always attained in an individual, but 

 certainly the spotted phase is most prominent in the smaller speci- 

 mens of the collection. Besides, it might be remembered that none 

 of the 16 young were black, but all true spotted forms. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The 16 young vary in length from 

 13.7-19.6 cm., while the adults are from 35-104.2 cm. (1 ft. 2 inches- 

 3 ft. 5 inches). Possibly the species may reach 4 feet in length and 

 a circumference of 6 inches, largest specimen being 5 inches in girth. 

 The gastrosteges range from 120-146, average 130; the urosteges 

 30-59, average 48; the anal is divided, in several with half a gastro- 

 stege ahead; the scale row formula of 18 individuals is 25-25-19, 

 the other formulae being 23-23-17, 24-22-17, 24-24-19, 25-21-19, 

 25-22-21, 25-23-18, 25-23-19, 25-25-18, 25-25-20, 25-25-21, 

 25-25-23, 26-25-21, 27-24-18, 27-25-19, or in the middle of the 

 body from 21-25, exceeding the usual range of the 3 species of 

 Heterodon by the loss of two rows (in 21-rowed condition) or in the 

 cephalic region extending from 23-27, two rows beyond the normal

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



155 



25 rows of Heterodon platyrhinus and simus. The temporals are 

 3^ on both sides in twenty-seven specimens, 3-4 on one side and 

 3-5 on the other in three specimens, and 3-4 and 4-5 in one specimen; 

 the supralabials are 8 in twenty-seven specimens, 9 in seven speci- 

 mens and 9-8 in three specimens; the infralabials are 11 in fifteen 

 specimens, 10 in three specimens, 12 in five, 13 in one, 10-11 in four, 

 10-12 in three, 11-12 in five and 12-13 in one. The orbital ring^ 

 exclusive of the supraocular is 10 cm both sides in thirteen specimens, 

 11 in one, 9-10 in two, 9-11 in two, 10-11 in fourteen, and 8-10 in 

 two, i.e., 22 of the 38 with number of oculars different on the two 

 sides. 



Rarely, the azygous plate may be cut off from contact with the 

 rostral by the prenasals (No. 6,186). One spotted specimen (No.

6,197) has not the characteristic azygous plate at all. Unlike Dr. 

 Stejneger's Heterodon browni,^^ this specimen has the posterior projec- 

 tion of the rostral more than one-half of the suture between the inter- 

 nasals and their mutual suture, therefore less than that between the 

 prefrontals. Otherwise, it is very much like it. The specimen has 

 the following scutellation: gastrosteges, 123; urosteges, 55; anal 

 divided; scales 25-21-19; supralabials 8; infralabials 11; orbital 

 ring 10, not including the supraocular; temporals 3-5 on the right 

 side and 3-4 on the left side. These characters and a very similar 

 coloration bring it in almost perfect agreement with Dr. Stejneger's 

 H. hroivni from the other end of Florida, namely, Lemon City. A 

 black individual (No. 6,194) has the frontal transversely divided 

 into two plates. One specimen (No. 6,202) has 2 loreals on either 



3° Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., XVI, pp. 123, 124. 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



side, and two others (Nos. 6,178 and 6,205), both small mdividuals, 

 have 2 loreals on one side and 1 on the other. Another (No. 6,204) 

 has 2 loreals on one side and 3 on the other, if an extra scale between 

 the oculars, loreals and 3d and 4th supralabials be called a loreal. 

 This small extra scale also occurs in No. 6,170. 



Habits. — This interesting snake proved very common around the 

 Lee's sandy clearing and in all dry parts of the swamp. It was the 

 first form to be observed and of it more specimens were taken than 

 of any other species. One might find it beside the trails or on the 

 islands where no human courses led. They were often taken about 

 and in the corn, "chufa, " "goober" and "yam" fields of the Lees, 

 where the snakes probably resort for breeding. Here it did not 

 seem to be solely a case of light-spotted phase for dry and sandy 

 places and dark phase in more woody and moist situations. In 

 the same open fields we find one phase one day and the other the 

 following day. In two instances we took adult spotted and black 

 phases within 40 feet of each other. We dare not make a distinction 

 between the two as to habitat, sex, food, etc., unless it be size or 

 age. In this case, often the oldest ones are not always black or 

 blackish, but they seem to tend that way. Of its "spreading" or 

 flattening we saw evidences, and the natives are well aware of the 

 assorted' defensive repertoire of this curious snake. They had none 

 of the superstitions about the emanations from it affecting the 

 atmosphere, nor did they believe that it "spat" its poison when 

 hissing. In all our captures we saw no particular signs of ill temper. 



Breeding. — This snake is oviparous. All through the month of 

 June we were finding the snakes in the planted fields of the Lees and 

 more than once almost stepped on the clumsy females of this species. 

 To these fields they came to lay their eggs, and throughout June 

 and later the boys were continually turning the eggs up to the surface 

 as they cultivated their fields in their primitive fashion. The eggs 

 invariably were in sandy soil and were usually 4 or 5 inches beneath 

 the surface. Sometimes in one set as many as 11 or 12 would be 

 found. One specimen (No. 6,175), taken June 3, 1912, had 22 eggs 

 far from ready for ovulation. Another specimen (No. 6,171) had 

 30 eggs, 16 on the right side and 14 on the left side. But the egg 

 complement may go beyond this 12-30 range. On June 19, Mr. 

 Paul Battle took a large Heterodon, from which he and one of the 

 authors squeezed 42 eggs. The females were not all of one phase: 

 some were black, others spotted. The above eggs were white with 

 much thinner integuments than those of the black snake and without 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 157 



the granules of the latter. These 42 eggs average |f (30 mm.) x 

 ^f (21 mm.) inches and are not far advanced in development. 



Food. — We can hardly hold that the black forms eat frogs and 

 toads and that the light ones will refuse frogs. Of course, if one 

 grants the more moist situations for the dark phase, such a differen- 

 tiation of diet preference might possibly occur. Our specimens 

 preferred toads. Three had each a southern toad {Bufo lentiginosus^ 

 lentiginosus) in their stomachs. Another had eaten three southern 

 toads, two full grown and one half grown. Three had partaken of 

 beetles and two had taken grasshoppers. 



Parasites. — Fourteen of the 21 adults had parasites in their stom- 

 achs or intestines. Sometimes the sole contents of the alimentary 

 tract might be a bundle of parasites ; in individual cases the stomach 

 would be absolutely filled with them. No snake compares with the 

 spreading adder as a host for these animals, and it may be due largely 

 to its strong Anuran diet.

 Summer Snake. Fig. 7 



Three specimens of this species were secured from Billy's Island, 

 on June 5, 1912, and the other two from July 15-November 1, 1912. 



Coloration. — This species is bright green above and usually yel- 

 lowish-white below and on the labials. In two of our specimens 

 the green of the back extends across the caudal two-thirds of each 

 gastrostege, but the chin and the labials are more or less yellowish- 

 white.

Dimensions and Variations. — The total length varies from 31.2- 

 68.1 cm.; the tail, from 12.0-26.7 cm., or 2.5-2.6 times in the total 

 length; the gastrosteges are from 151-160; the urosteges, 130-148; 

 anal divided, in No. 6,233, the ventral plate ahead divided and one 

 of the halves also horizontally subdivided; scales 17-17-15; loreal

present; oculars 1-2, in No. 6,143 caudad of the lower postocular 

 is a small scale hardly a temporal; if this be not a temporal, the 

 temporal formula for all three is 1-2; infralabials 8, the fifth largest; 

 supralabials 8 in one specimen and 7 in the other two, eye resting on 

 the 3d and 4th supralabial; scales 17-17-15, the lower row smooth, 

 the second row very faintly keeled. 



Habits, Food. — In our experience this species is decidedly arboreal, 

 and Profs. Crosby and Bradley record the same habitat for it. The 

 specimens were taken from small bushes, and it is a close second 

 to Elaphe obsoletus and its allies in its tree-climbing proclivities as 

 the records and its long, slender body testify. This species is quite 

 thoroughly insectivorous, one specimen having undeterminable 

 insect remains in the rectum; another, a partly digested beetle larva, 

 and the largest, parts of a tree cricket and other orthopterous remains 

 with insect eggs presumably belonging to the prey captured. 



5. Coluber constrictor L.: Black Snake; Black Racer; Racer; Black Runner; Blue Racer; 

 White-throated Racer. Plate III, fig. 5; fig. 8. 



This slender snake was one of the most common species of the 

 islands, but only thirteen of them were captured because of their 

 speed. 



Coloration. — In coloration this smooth-scaled snake is shining 

 black above and slaty or plumbeous beneath; the white chin and 

 throat in most of the specimens occupy the mental, infralabials, 

 geneials, first 2-3 gular gastrosteges, the cephalic gulars and the 

 lower edges of the supralabials; two or three of the larger specimens 

 have slaty chins except for a small white spot, which in one case 

 covers parts of the mental, inner border of the 1st and 2d infralabials 

 and the anterior geneials, while in the other it occupies 1st gastro- 

 stege and two gulars. One medium-sized specimen (No. 6,152) 

 has more of a brown tinge, and the gastrosteges are slaty except for 

 the caudal borders which are distinctly white; another specimen 

 was decidedly whitish on the caudal ventral third of the body. A 

 young specimen taken June 23, 1912, had spots on the back vaguely 

 discernible and on the venter had a series of pink spots near the 

 ends of the gastrosteges. These spots were lost entirely in the 

 region of the 90th-100th gastrosteges. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These snakes vary in length from 

 71.4-127 cm.; the tail from 18.1-35.4 cm. or 3.4-3.8 times in the 

 total length; the gastrosteges are 176-189, average 182; the uro- 

 steges, 92-110, average 103; anal plate divided; in three specimens, 

 the gastrostege ahead of the anal plate is divided or a quarter gastro-

stege is cut out of it; in eleven of the thirteen specimens the scales 

 are in 17-17-15 rows; in No. 6,208, 19-17-15, and in No. .6,207, 

 19-15-15; preoculars 2, the upper one often with a transverse furrow 

 extending across it for ^ to ^ of its width; postoculars 2, except in 

 No. 6,152, where 3 are on the left side; temporals 2-2-2, rarely 

 3-3-3, or 3-2-2, or 1-1-2; infralabials 8, in four specimens 9 on 

 ■one side; loreal 1, but in No. 6,157 there are two, the upper one 

 being cut off from the prefrontal; rarely the postnasal is transversely 

 divided; supralabials 7, in No. 6,154 there are only 6 on the left side, 

 the normal 5th and 6th having united; in Nos. 6,150 and 6,156 

 8 supralabials are on both sides, while in No. 6,151 there are 8 on 

 one side and 7 on the other; whenever eight supralabials occur, the 

 eye rests on the 4th and 5th supralabials, not on the 3d and 4th. 

 This eight supralabial condition Cope thinks rather peculiar to 

 the Plains (flaviventris) or Pacific {vetustum) forms of C. constrictor. 



6154 6151 6154 



6157 6152 6151 



Fig. 8. — Coluber constrictor Linn. 



The presence of three specimens with 8 supralabials and 1 loreal 

 and one specimen with 7 supralabials and 2 loreals suggests that 

 in C. stejnegerianus these characters are hardly of enough value 

 for the establishment of this new form on these slender grounds 

 alone. In fact, distinctive scutellation characters between C. 

 constrictor and C. flxgellum become scarce in the light of this large 

 percentage of 8 supralabials in our collection. The characters of 

 the frontal and color become more than ever the main reliance. 



Habits. — ^This species and the spreading adder are the two most 

 common snakes of the drier parts of the swamp. It seems to prefer 

 the cover of the blueberries and saw palmettoes, Avhere it swiftly 

 pursues its prey. It, however, also appeared commonly about the 

 Lee's clearing, where it was often seen but seldom captured. Only 

 when we could get it in the open did we stand a fair chance of taking 

 it alive, so lightning-like are its movements. In fact, it is fast 

 enough to catch anything which moves on the ground of its environ- 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar.^ 



ment, and no doubt its omnivorous appetite is partly due to its 

 speed. It can climb among the bushes, though we usually found it 

 on the ground. The natives think it beneficial and allow it to climb 

 into their corn cribs because it catches the troublesome rats and 

 mice. 



Food. — It is considered harmless, and of its antipathy for rattle- 

 snakes we neither saw nor heard any evidence. It doubtless will 

 attack the poisonous snakes, but not to the extent that its arch- 

 enemy, the king snake, does. Its speed is marvellous, and all the 

 lizards of the swamp prove its prey. This even includes the "race 

 nag" {Cnemidophor'us sexlineatus), which suffers most; at least two 

 of our specimens had the tails of these lizards in their stomachs, 

 indicating that the lizards were swallowed head first. One cannot 

 help wondering how the blacksnake captures these speedy reptiles. 

 Another species which the blacksnake uses for food is the slowest 

 lizard of the islands, the ground lizard {Lygosoma laterale). In some 

 of the specimens we found sand in their stomachs. This species is 

 very fond of frogs and toads, all the dry-land forms being in the 

 list, the toad {Bufo I. lentiginosus) occupying first place. One 

 snake had 4 adult Carolina tree frogs (Hyla carolinensis) and 1 

 pine-wood's tree frog {Hyla femoralis) in its stomach; all being- 

 taken head first. It seems not to scorn insects, beetles being the 

 principal group identified. 



Parasites. — This species is quite badly troubled with internal 

 parasites, five of the thirteen specimens having such in their ali- 

 mentary tracts. The first snake captured — a young one — had mites 

 all along the edges of the gastrostegal plates, a condition subsequently 

 observed in one or two other specimens. 



Breeding. — The black snake is oviparous. One individual taken 

 June 1, 1912, had 14 half-sized eggs; another taken June 8 had 11 

 eggs in about the same condition. On June 21, a specimen was 

 taken with 5 mature eggs. On June 19, Mr. Farley Lee went out 

 to get some smudge wood at 7 P.M., when darkness had just begun. 

 Upon lifting a rotten log he found a female blacksnake which was 

 laying its eggs under the log. It had laid three eggs, and we suc- 

 ceeded in forcing another from the specimen. In the female were 

 five more, making the complement 9 in all. Only two kinds of 

 reptilian eggs exceed these in abundance and ease of discovery, 

 namely, those of the Florida cooter {Chrysemys floridana) and of the 

 spreading adder (Heterodon platyrhinus) . The four eggs above 

 mentioned measured as follows : 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 161 



32 mm. (1| inches) x 18 mm. (f^ inch). 

 39 mm. (IfV " ) x 16 mm. (| " ). 

 36 mm. (lyV " ) x 17 mm. {\\ " ). 



30 mm. (lf\ '' )xl8mm. (H " )• 



Three others quite fresh in appearance when ploughed up were: 



36 mm. (lyV inches) x 17 mm. (H inch). 

 36 mm. (liV " ) x 18 mm. (H " ). 

 41 mm. (If " ) X 16 mm. (| " ). 



Another batch of four taken in a similar way had been developing 

 for a time and at preservation measured: 



36 mm. (ly^g inches) x 22 mm. (| inch). 



33 mm. (IfV " ) x 23 mm. (| " ). 



34 mm. (If " ) x 22 mm. (| " ). 

 36 mm. (lyV " ) x 22 mm. (| " ). 



In all these eleven eggs the usual shape is elliptical with blunt, 

 rounded ends. In the first and second sets, one egg is much more 

 elongate and one end more pointed than the other. This tendency 

 toward the ovoid form also comes in the third set, where development 

 has progressed and the increase in size has been in girth. All these 

 eggs when laid are white with tough, coracious shells which are 

 covered with small crystal-shaped or cup-like granules. These 

 make the egg quite distinctive. 



6. Elaphe guttatus (Linn.): Com Snake; Rat Snake; Chicken Snake; Red Chicken Snake; 

 Mouse Snake; House King Snake; House Snake; Spotted Snake; Spotted Racer; Spotted 

 Coluber; Red Coluber. 



Only two specimens (Nos. 6,229, 6,230) were taken July 15- 

 November 1, 1912, after our departure. Beyer^^ thinks of them as 

 fairly common in pine-wood regions, but says, "It is not found in 

 the swamp lands, being strictly terrestrial in its habits." Certainly, 

 this form must have travelled through swamp to reach Billy's Island 

 and doubtless encounters moisture enough on the islands. 



Coloration. — This beautiful snake is light red or ashy-gray, with 

 a series of dorsal dark red, crimson or brick-red saddles or transverse 

 bars. These are 3-5 scales wide, occupy from 10-13 rows and have 

 dark-edged borders. On one specimen there are 50 in all, 36 before 

 the vent and 14 beyond it; in the other, there are 41 blotches, 29 

 before the vent and 12 beyond it. On either side appears an alter- 

 nating row of smaller dark-bordered red spots. Anteriorly, these

162 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



become very narrow and the elongate black borders constitute most 

 of the spots. The third row on the first four rows of scales only 

 shows distinctly in the anterior region. The venter has a tinge of 

 the color of the back, but appears to be mainly white or yellowish- 

 white, tessellated or checkered with quadrangular black spots. In 

 markings of the head these specimens very well agree with Elaphe 

 guttatus guttatus. 



Dimensions and Variations. — ^These two specimens are, respect- 

 ively, 97.3 and 111.8 cm. long; the tails, 16.2 and 18.7 cm., or 6 in 

 the total length; the gastrosteges are 218, 227; the urosteges, 69 

 and 68; anal divided; the scales are 24-27-18 and 23-27-19; the 

 oculars 1-2; the temporals 2-3 (4) and 2-3; the supralabials 8; 

 the infralabials 11 and 12.. 



Food. — This species belongs to the group known as rat snakes, 

 and each specimen proves true to racial reputation. In the stomach 

 of each we found a full-grown rice-field rat {Onjzoniijs palustris) and 

 other remains. Both of the rats had been swallowed head first, and 

 we firmly believe them to have been taken alive. This requires 

 considerable dexterity in nature where the prey is not cornered and 

 may also be another bit of evidence to show this species more aquatic 

 than usually thought. No parasites were found in the alimentary 

 tract of either specimens. 



7. Elaphe obsoletus (Say): Pilot Snake; Chicken Snake; Spotted Chicken Snake; Gray 

 Coluber; Gray Rat Snake. Fig. 9. 



Six specimens of this puzzling form were taken, and we regret 

 this series is not larger. However, this small collection confirms 

 us in the belief that Scotophis confinis B. and G., Coluber obsoletus 

 lemniscatus Cope, Coluber spiloides Dum and Bib., possibly Scotophis 

 latus B. and G., and Coluber quadrivittatus Holbrook are individual 

 variations of Elaphe obsoletus. This conclusion in its main features 

 is in agreement with Boulenger and Rhoades and partly in accord 

 with Hay's and Brown's diagnoses of these forms of the genus Elaphe. 



Coloration. — The ground color of the specimens is an ashy-, 

 brownish- or yellowish-gray with a series of 30-36 dorsal grayish- 

 brown to dark chocolate-brown spots on the body and 9-16 on the 

 tail. In the cephalic half of the body these spots have their anterior 

 and posterior edges concave, i.e., their angles produced, thus giving 

 the spot the shape of a ray's egg; in the caudal part of the body the 

 dorsal spots are more or less quadrate. Occasionally, the 1st and 2d 

 or the 2d and 3d dorsal spots are more or less united. In one speci- 

 men for its entire length (No. 6,136) these dorsal spots are connected 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



at the angles by a longitudinal stripe on each side, as in Coluber 

 obsoletus lemniscatus Cope. The dorsal spots are 3-4 scales long 

 and cover 8-10 rows of scales. On the 2d-6th rows occurs a lateral 

 row of spots which alternate with the dorsal spots. In the anterior 

 region they become very elongate and linear. In No. 6,136, with 

 two faint dorsal longitudinal bands, this lateral row is connected 

 by a longitudinal band on each side, the band obscuring the spots 

 in the caudal half of the body. Thus, in this specimen, we have 

 the four bands of C. quadrivittatus, but the spots of C. spiloides or 

 C. 0. confinis, in other words, a good C. o. lemniscatus Cope. To 

 add to the confusion, the temporals on one side are 2-3-5 while on 

 the other side they are 2-1-2. Beneath the lateral row of spots 

 occurs another row just above the gastrostegal keel of each side. 

 Each of these spots is opposite a dorsal spot and occupies the first 

 row of scales and the ends of 2 sometimes 3 gastrosteges do\ATi to the 

 gastrostegal keel. Sometimes, however, this lowest row of spots 

 does not alternate with the lateral row and sometimes this lowest 

 row is obscure. The venter in the large specimens is yellowish-white 

 or straw-color (most yello's\dsh in the quadrivittatus-lemniscatus 

 specimen), while the two smallest specimens have it whitish or 

 ashy-white. In some, irrespective of size, the venter in the cephalic 

 fourth or fifth of the body is immaculate, while in others it is with 

 spots like the ground color of the dorsum; the venter posteriorly 

 may be almost solid in color like the dorsum. In some, the chin 

 and throat area may be immaculate yellow, yellomsh-white or white 

 or the gulars may be slightly grayish. In all the infralabials have 

 black borders as have the supralaliials, but the intensity of this color 

 varies. Two specimens have no postocular band at all, one of the 

 smaller ones has it indistinct, another has it on one side and absent 

 on the other and two have it very prominent. Only two have the 

 darker black prefrontal cross band (on posterior margins). The 

 presence or absence of head bands in this assemblage of snakes is 

 too variable and individualistic a character to be of much weight in 

 separating species. Some of our specimens have the head uniform 

 like the body color; others are with distinct head bands. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The six specimens vary in length 

 from 68.7-144 cm., the tail from 12.8-27 cm. or 5.0-6.2 times in the 

 total leng-th. The gastrosteges range from 231-243, or average 236; 

 the urosteges are 71-92 or average 85; anal divided, in No. 6,135 

 entire; the oculars are 1-2, except in No. 6,135 where 1-2 and 2-2, 

 the upper preocular coming from the forward part of a normal

supraocular; supralabials 8, except in one specimen where 8 on the 

 left side and 9 on the right side; eye resting on the -ith and 5th 

 supralabials; infralabials 11 or 12; temporals variable, in three 

 specimens 2-3 as in C. spiloides Dum. and Bib., in one 2-3 on one 

 side and 2-1 on the other, in another 2-3 and 2-4, in a sixth 2-3 and 

 3-4, the last a duplicate of Cope's figure 196, p. 851, for C. laclus 

 B. and G., and, strangely enough, the 2-3 condition barely escapes 

 being 1-2; in fact, in just these six specimens on one side or on the 

 other we practically have duplicates of the temporal scutellations 

 of Cope's figures 191-196, namely, for C. rosaceus, quadriviUatus, 

 spiloides, obsoletus obsoletus, ohsoletus lemniscatiis, and ketus — rather 

 too strong an individualistic a variation in a localized collection of 

 six to make it a stable and cardinal character of primary dictinction. 



Fig. 9. — Elaphe obsoletus (Say). 



The scale formulas are 29-29-19 for two specimens, 29-27-19, 

 27-27-19, 26-29-19, 25-27-17; from 9-23 keeled rows of scales; 

 anterior chin shields touching 4th and 5th infralabials. 



Our specimens agree best with Coluber spiloides Dum. and Bib., 

 although equally well with C. obsoletus confinis if Cope's first temporal 

 scale be considered abnormal for this form. One specimen seems a 

 good C. obsoletus lemniscatus, if not more than an incipent C. quad- 

 riviUatus. All in all, if the supposed diagnostic characters of these 

 four break down in a collection of six snakes from one isolated envi- 

 ronment, one must question the weight to be attached to such dis- 

 tinctions. 



Habits. — This agile and slender snake is the most arboreal snake 

 of the swamp. Its compressed body with the gastrostegal keels on 

 either side where the sides abruptly meet the venter suggests an 

 arboreal form and its habits confirm the belief. This species was 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



found along the water courses near Billy's Lake. Here they climb 

 up the bushes and small trees which skirt some of the streams of the 

 swamp. Our first specimen was 6 feet up above the water, and they 

 have ascended 10 or more feet in our few experiences with them. 

 They are probably far more common than our collection might imply, 

 but their position, the cover of the dense herbage and the color of 

 the body, all make them rather difficult to find. 



Breeding. — This is an ovoviviparous snake and three specimens 

 taken June 1, 3 and 15, 1912, had the eggs quite immature. One 

 had 18 on the left side and 15 on the right side; another had 14 in 

 all, 8 on the right side and 6 on the left side. 



Food. — No doubt this form secures much of its food in the bushes 

 and trees it so commonly frequents, and true to the reputation of 

 E. ohsoletus of the north this Okefinokee representative proves an 

 enemy of the birds. The natives steadfastly held that it ate birds' 

 eggs and young. One specimen had partaken of some kind of eggs 

 and a second individual had birds' feathers in its stomach. A 

 third snake had eaten the pine-wood's tree frog {Hyla femoralis). 

 This species also frequents the islands and feeds on the ground. 

 Here they do damage to the ground-nesting birds, as many of the 

 other species of snakes do. They also often enter poultry yards 

 for rats and mice as well as the hens' eggs. One of the native boys 

 brought us a pilot snake which he claimed was caught in the act of 

 swallomng a hen's egg, and stomach contents substantiated his 

 claim. They report that they have taken some which had eaten 

 as many as ten at one time. None of these six snakes had parasites. 



8. Lampropeltis doliatus COCCineus (Schlegel): Scarlet King Snake; Red King Snake; "Coral 

 Snake." Fig. 7. 



Six specimens of this fine, l)eautiful snake were taken on Billy's 

 Island. The nearest records are from Fernandina, Fla. (C. F. 

 Batchelder), and from Gainesville, Fla. (J. Bell). Each of these 

 Cope accredits to the form Osceola elapsoidea Holbrook. 



Coloration. — Ground color scarlet (fainter below) covered with 

 14-20 pairs of black rings on the body from head to anus and with 

 3-6 pairs on the tail. These rings inclose white or yellowish intervals, 

 which are 1-1 1 scales wide on the dorsum and 2|-3 scales wide on 

 the side, the black rings themselves each being 2-4 scales wide. In 

 only one specimen. No. 6,240, do the rings completely and perfectly 

 encircle the body for its entire length, and, in the caudal region, the 

 abdominal white interval has a black spot between the black rings. 

 In the other specimens the rings just fall short of meeting each other 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



on the venter and sometimes their ends alternate. Frequently, the 

 black bands of a pair have their ends uniting with each other send 

 not with opposite ends. Occasionally the process goes farther and 

 on the sides a black bar extends from one black band to another 

 across the white interval and we have part of a white interval com- 

 pletely encircled by black dorsally and ventrally as well as on the 

 sides. The black band on the neck is not complete on the ventral 

 side in any of the six individuals; ahead of it, comes a white or 

 yellowish-white interval, narrower on the dorsum but wider on the 

 sides where it extends across the angle of the mouth onto the upper 

 posterior labials and on the lower surface of the head. The black 

 occipital bar in one specimen is limited to one occipital; in the 

 others it generally reaches to the temporals and the posterior edge 

 of the frontal and the supraoculars. In one specimen there is a 

 black band back of the eye, and in another the occipital black bar 

 covers the occipitals, most of the frontal, all of the supraoculars, 

 postoculars and 1st temporal and the upper surface of the two 

 posterior supralabials. Sometimes the supralabials near the eye 

 and rarely a few infrala])ials immediately below may have dark 

 margins. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The total length varies from 23.7- 

 57.6 cm.; the tail, 3.4-8.9 cm. or 6-7.2 times in the total length; 

 the gastrosteges are 172-189; the urosteges 39-48; anal entire; 

 the supralabials 7; infralabials 8 except on one side of No. 6,240, 

 where there are 9; the oculars are 1-2. 



From a study of these six specimens from one locality we were 

 led to conclude that Lampropeltis doliatus coccineus and Osceola 

 elapsoidea were the same form, and this conclusion came independ- 

 ently of the previous judgments of Brown, Brimley and others. 

 Brown says,^^ ''t}je head plates and scales are becoming variable, 

 specimens being found without a loreal and with the scales reduced 

 to nineteen rows. This extreme reduction is Osceola elapsoidea 

 B. and G., and is not common, but intermediate stages are frequent; 

 out of some thirty specimens colored as in coccineus I have met 

 with two without a loreal and with 19 rows. The case is peculiar. 

 If constant, the distinction would be a generic one; on the other 

 hand, the importance of the character involved would seem to 

 lift it out of the ordinary category of intergradation, for we appar- 

 ently have a subspecies being transformed under our eyes. On 



*2 Brown, A. E. A Review of the Genera and Species of American Snakes

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



the whole, it may accord best with a sound method to take no note 

 of this form at its present stage." C. S. Brimley says that in his 

 experience "the normal formula is, scales in 19 rows, occasionally 

 17 or 21, one temporal in first row, occasionally two, and loreal 

 usually present, but sometimes absent on one or both sides. "^^ Only 

 in his Florida specimens were the scales in 17 rows. Like these, 

 our specimens have a greater reduction in number of scale rows 

 than Cope's material, the formulae being 17-15-15, 17-19-15, 17- 

 19-15, 17-19-17, 17-19-17, 17-19-17. This is a reduction far 

 beyond the 21 rows of Cope's and Brown's descriptions and if any- 

 thing below the better normal of Brimley. So, in this respect, our 

 specimens incline towards Osceola elapsoidea. Furthermore, only 

 in the specimen (No. 6,100) with this reduction carried farthest 

 (17-15-15) do we have the loreals of both sides absent, but it is one 

 of the largest of the six specimens'. In this individual the prefrontal 

 has descended to the level of the labial and in the forms (Lv d. coccin- 

 eus) with loreals these plates must be derived from the prefrontal. 

 In No. 6,242 the loreal is very small and linear, while in No. 6,240 

 it is normal and quadrangular on one side and triangular on the 

 other, the apex not even touching the preocular. In 3 specimens 

 (Nos. 6,101 the smallest, 6,241, 6,249 the largest) the loreal is present 

 on both sides and a prominent quadrangular plate from the pre- 

 ocular to the nasal. 



Habits. — This species is more or less of a burrower, but a glance 

 at some of the largest specimens suggests Elaphe snakes in their 

 compressed deep bodies with sides sharply defined from the venter 

 by a ridge. Such elaphine snakes climb well and of such evidence 

 in L. d. coccineus we have only the capture of a snake taken June 6, 

 1912. It was found on one of the frames of an old building, the 

 snake being 31-4 feet above the ground. 



Food. — In food habits this species is more or less of a constrictor. 

 It feeds on ground lizards, skinks, swifts and other snakes and 

 insects. In the stomach of No. 6,242 we found an angleworm and 

 the remains of two killifishes, suggesting more of any aquatic nature 

 than usually ascribed, but after every rain Billy's Island is covered 

 with little water pools containing fish which as evaporation goes on 

 become stranded. Such Avould be easy of capture. Our specimens 

 yielded no clue to the oviparity or breeding of this species.

 Ttiunder Snake; Thunder and Lightning Snake; Wamper; Wampum Snake; Rattlesnake 

 Pilot. Plate III, fig. 2; fig. 10. 



Thirteen specimens of this fine snake were taken and many more 

 seen. It is common throughout the drier parts of the swamp and 

 frequents the outskirts of the swamp as well. It keeps to the islands 

 and none were taken in other situations than the saw palmetto or 

 heath societies of the piney woods where it courses through the low 

 cover after its living prey or eggs. Okefinokee swamp comes within 

 the supposed range of L. g. getulus and is considerably east of Louis- 

 iana where L. g. sayi is recorded. The nearest records of L. g. 

 getulus are from Fernandina, Fla. (C. F. Batchelder), Gainesville, 

 Fla. (J. Bell), and Nashville, Ga. (W. J. Taylor). 



Coloration. — Most of the specimens at hand vary from a light to 

 a deep brown. Five are shining blackish-brown in body color, but 

 these are among the smallest specimens of the collection. All thirteen 

 have white or yellowish cross-bands which may be from 23-25 in 

 number on the body proper, rarely as low as 18, and from 5-10 on 

 the tail. Often these bands are incomplete and appear only on one 

 side with none corresponding on the other side, and frequently in 

 such specimens the cross-bands may be diagonal — not strict cross- 

 bands; in many of the specimens the bifurcations on the sides are 

 absent and the cross-band scales of the dorsum have dark body color 

 tips which at times so blacken the scales as to interrupt the bands 

 completely. In one specimen the band was very indistinct. These 

 bands are normally 1^-2 scales wide on the dorsum or rarely 2, rarely 

 3-5 scales wide on the sides where the bands bifurcate bordering a 

 spot of body color. These lateral spots alternate with similar 

 dorsal areas and are from 3-7 scales wide and occupy the lower 

 2 or 3 rows of scales as well as the ends of 3-5 gastrosteges. The 

 dark dorsal areas are 7-10 scales wide; in some they are a beautiful 

 shining black or deep brown; in two or three of the specimens each 

 scale of the cephalic half of the body has a pale central spot; in three 

 specimens with shining black body color the first four to six dark 

 areas back of the head had patches of scales with white centres as 

 conspicuous as the cross bands themselves (suggestive of L. g. splen- 

 didus); finally one brown (No. 6,218) king snake has all the scales 

 with every centre of the same intensity of color as the conspicuous 

 cross-bands (very suggestive of L. g. sayi). The venter is of the 

 same color as the cross-bands and is heavily blotched with black 

 due in part to the extension of the lateral spots on the gastrosteges. 

 All the head plates are conspicuously marked with white or yellowish 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169 



spots, particularly so in No. 6,218. The three subspecies getulus, 

 sayi and splendidus intergrade so imperceptibly and specimens from 

 one region sometimes reveal all the supposed distinguishing 

 characters. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These specimens vary from 67.6- 

 144.4 cm. (2 ft. 1 in.-4 ft. 9 in.) and the tail from 9.1-19.3 cm. (7.4- 

 9 in the total length); the gastrosteges are 214-223 or average 218; 

 urosteges are 41-54 or average 49; the scales are 21-21-19 in eight 

 of the specimens and the other formulas are 21-23-19, 22-21-19, 

 23-21-19 twice, 23-23-19; the oculars are 1-2; supralabials 7; 

 infralabials 9 or 10; temporals may deviate from 2-3, the formula 

 for ten specimens, one specimen has thern 1-3, another has 2-2 and 

 a third 2-3 on one side and 2-4 on the other; the loreal is present 

 in all and in No. 6,218 {sayi-WkQ specimen) there are two on the left 

 side. The anal is entire, in No. 6,139 it is entire, but the gastrostege 

 ahead is divided and in No. 6,140 the anal plate is divided into 

 three parts.

Fig. 10. — Lampropeltis getulus getulus (Linn.) 



Habits. — This species is one of the most strikingly marked snakes 

 of the swamp. The shining black or brown with the contrasting 

 white or yellow cross-bands makes its appearance very attractive. 

 In nature, it is mild, proves an interesting and safe pet, and in no 

 instance during our stay in the swamp did it display any tendency 

 toward belligerency or sullenness toward any member of the party. 



Food. — The natives recognize its goodnature and consider it harm- 

 less, though the king of the snakes. They are aware of its usefulness 

 as an enemy of moccasins and rattlesnakes and report several 

 combats which always resulted successfully for the king snake, but 

 these unlettered people, unlike many sentimental writers, do not 

 hold that the king snake deliberately searches for the poisonous 

 snakes in particular. We, as they, believe it the enemy of ever}' 

 species of snake in the swamp, preying of course more on the terres- 

 trial species of its own haunts. All the smaller snakes suffer, and 

 of the larger species, the blacksnake and spreading adder are the 

 commonest prey. It is surely a good "pilot" to the naturalist 




170 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mai.^ 



whenever one finds it digging, for it almost invariably means other 

 snakes, eggs or some good capture. It will seldom fail to react per 

 schedule if you loosely hold it in one hand and a live blacksnake 

 in the other. Almost before you can predict the outcome, the 

 former may be far within its captor — a demonstration we have tried 

 more than once in the field. It is especially fond of young snakes. 

 One of our specimens had taken a newly hatched Heterodon and the 

 natives recounted several occasions when they had found it working 

 beneath a log for what proved a brood of young snakes. We do 

 not doubt but that it feeds on mice, rats and other small mammals^ 

 but of such evidence we found little in the swamp. Possibly, in 

 early spring or in the fall these are more its reliance. The principal 

 food of this species is turtles' eggs, with snakes or their eggs a second 

 choice. Four of our specimens had eaten Florida cooters' {Chrysemys 

 floridana) eggs which they dug out of the sand and two had mud 

 turtle {Cino sternum pennsylvdnicum) eggs in their stomachs. Mr. 

 Francis Harper tells us that he and David Lee almost stepped on a 

 king snake. After their recovery, what should they find but a 

 Kinosternon digging in sand probably preparatory to laying and the 

 king snake was close at hand. In fact, so addicted are they to this 

 egg diet, that the natives consider that it is a common happening 

 to find the snake awaiting the egg deposition. Unless it be the 

 Florida bear, there is no form in the swamp which eats turtles' eggs 

 in such quantity as the king snake. It will take a whole nest of 

 eggs at one time, as many as 14 being found in the stomach of one 

 snake. 



Breeding. — Of the breeding habits of this species we have a few 

 scant notes. Mr. Harper reports a pair of them mating on May 19, 

 1912, and says another king snake was watching the pair. One 

 of our specimens (No. 6,145), taken June 13, 1912, had 7 fair-sized 

 eggs. Only one of the specimens had parasites, and this had two 

 large parasitic worms 30 mm. long fastened to the outside of the 

 esophagus and lying in the body cavity. 



10. Cemophora COCCinea Blumenbach: Scarlet Snake; "Coral Snake"; Red Snake. Plate 

 III. fig. 3. 



One specimen of the scarlet snake was captured on Billy's Island 

 by one of the native boys. This appears to be one of the rarer snakes 

 of the swamp, six of the scarlet king snakes being taken to the lone 

 one of this species. This species extends from Maryland to Florida 

 and westward to the Mississippi Valley. 



Coloration. — The color of the back is a salmon-pink, brighter 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



anteriorly; the back and sides with 20 pairs of black half-rings, the 

 first on the head, the 16th just back of the anus and the last two 

 rather indistinct. The black half-rings are widest dorsally, on the 

 sides the black rings of a pair approach each other soon to diverge 

 again as the 4th-2d rows of scales are reached. An irregular black 

 spot on the 1st row of scales at the lower end of each white interval 

 sometimes unites the ends of two half-rings; bands between half- 

 rings ivory-white* with very fine dots all over the scales. Width 

 of each black half-ring usually two scales, but one scale wide half 

 way down the sides; the interval usually three scales wide. The 

 first black band narrow and extending from 1st temporal along the 

 anterior margins of the occipital plates to the 1st temporal of the 

 other side. First temporal may be entirely or half black. The 

 gastrosteges almost entirely free of markings. 



Dimensions. — -The total length is 36.4 cm.; the tail 5.4 cm. or 

 6f in total length; the gastrosteges 169; urosteges 19; anal entire, 

 but a half gastrostege ahead of it; temporals 1-2; the nasal divided 

 below nostril; supralabials 6, eye resting on the 2d and 3d supra- 

 labials; infralabials 7; loreal point almost enters eye's orbit on the 

 left side, but is more remote on the right side. 



Breeding. — This specimen, taken June 20, had three white eggs 

 which were very elongate and with thin membranous integument. 

 They were, respectively, 34, 35, 35 mm. long. 



11. TropidonotUS taxispilotUS (Holbrook): "Water Moccasin"; Pied Water Snake; Browa 

 Water Snake; Water Rattle; Water Pilot; Aspic. 



Only eleven specimens of this species were taken, yet it is common 

 along Billy's and Minne's Lakes, Log River and all the more open 

 water courses. It was not far from the Okefinokee Swamp that 

 Holbrook secured one of his two specimens for his original descrip- 

 tion, namely, from Altamaha River. The natives were not anxious 

 to help us in the captures of this species. 



Coloration. — -The coloration is a light chocolate- or reddish-brown, 

 sometimes rusty with a series of three rows of large subquadrate or 

 rectangular spots, the dorsal row varying from 23-27 dark brown or 

 black spots before the anus and 15-18 behind the anus, the averages 

 being 25 and 16, respectively. Anteriorly, the spots are 3-4 scales 

 wide and posteriorly 2-3 scales wide. Li transverse width the larger 

 spots cover 8-10 rows of scales. Alternating with the dorsal spots 

 is a row on either side. These spots cover from the 1st to the 10th 

 row of scales. Normally, the lateral and doreal spots do not touch 

 as the descriptions assert, but in almost every specimen one or tw» 




172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



sets, particularly in the middle of the body, are connected by a 

 black line 1 scale wide. The venter is white or yellowish. Hol- 

 brook's description, "Most of them (gastrosteges) with a black spot 

 at either extremity and the centre dotted minutely with black," 

 applies to some of the younger specimens very well, and in almost 

 all the older individuals the same coloration can be discovered, 

 namely, two rows of squarish black blotches with a dusted lighter 

 Hne down the middle of the belly. Rarely, the black obscures all 

 semblance of pattern. The gular gastrosteges usually are without 

 the lateral spots and the whole anterior edge is black bordered; the 

 head is like the body in color; the lower labials have a fine dusted 

 appearance. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The specimens vary in length from 

 63-130.5 cm., all except four being over 100 cm.; in the largest 

 specimen (130.5 cm.) the tail is 30.5 cm. long and the tail is con- 

 tained in the length in the eleven specimens from 3|-5J times, 4 or 

 4J being the riormal. The gastrosteges are 130-142 or average 

 135; the urosteges are 62-70, the average 67, far below the 70-90 

 of Cope and Brown. Anal plate usually divided; in three specimens 

 with a half gastrostege ahead of it and in one or two a whole gastro- 

 stege divided, otherwise this plate anterior to anal plate is entire; 

 in No. 6,111 the anal is entire and in No. 6,224 it is also entire with 

 a faint transverse median furrow extending halfway backward 

 toward the anus. The scale rows are far below 31-33 rows, the 

 combinations being 27-27-21, 28-28-22, 29-31-22, 29-29-21 twice, 

 29-30-23, 29-30-22, 30-30-25, 30-29-22, 30-28-23, 31-31-21 or 

 in the middle of the body from 27-31— not 29-31 or 31-33 as dis- 

 covered in other members of this genus. In fact, only two have 

 31 and only three 30 in the middle of the body. The oculars are 

 1-2; the supralabials 8, the eye resting on the 4th, except in rare 

 cases when over the 4th and 5th; the infralabials 10-12; temporals 

 2-4 in eight instances, 2-5 in six and 2-3 in three cases. 



Habits. — This snake is par excellence the snake of the open water 

 courses in the swamp or narrow runs just wide enough for a boat. 

 Either along Log River or Minne Lake Run one can hear a succession 

 of pied water snakes as they drop off into the water. They may 

 climb upon the dead branches or live shrubs which line the water 

 courses or rest on the little islets or verdant hummocks where many 

 an individual is hidden. Particularly does one find them in the 

 latter situations on the hottest days, and not infrequently we have 

 approached close enough on such days to club them. As they 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 173 



shoot into the water sometimes the pied belly reveals that it is 

 T. taxispilotus, and not T. fosciatus or any of its subspecies. 



The pied water snakes are very large and in general very shy and 

 elusive. We had been in the swamp for 2h weeks before we cap- 

 tured our first specimens, although some of us passed them daily. 

 At first we had to shoot them as they rested in the open on branches 

 2-3| feet above the water. Then their capture was not always 

 certain, for we often lost them because of our caution in landing 

 them. The natives are afraid of them, and whoever has wounded 

 or had experiences with this species in its wild state knows they are 

 vicious and belligerent when hard pressed. The natives call them 

 "water moccasin" and consider them as poisonous as rattlesnakes 

 or true moccasins. Once when one of us was bitten by a medium- 

 sized specimen the Lees awaited the result with considerable solicitude 

 for the supposed unfortunate. After two weeks of attempts, we 

 were growing impatient because we had taken none of the largest 

 individuals, and "Alligator Joe," one of the visitors, when fishing, 

 stunned a "water moccasin" and considerately put it in the prow 

 of his boat. We had almost reached him when the snake revived, 

 and in the twinkling of an eye he had thrown his present into the 

 lake with his oar. Man and live "water moccasin" in the same 

 boat was not conceivable. And there is plenty of reason for our 

 common respect for this large water snake, which reaches 5 or barely 

 6 feet. The largest specimen secured measured 4| feet. Several 

 specimens in hand measure in girth from 7-8 inches, and we are 

 positive we have seen individuals with a circumference of 10-12 

 inches. Especially is this true of the females as the embryos develop. 

 Then the skin is so distended that j^ to | of an inch or more separates 

 each of the scales. 



Breeding. — This species is ovoviviparous. The specimens taken 

 in the middle of June showed the developmental stages little ad- 

 vanced. One specimen (No. 6,113), 2 feet 10 inches long, had only 

 14 embryos, while another, 4^ feet long and about 8 inches in circum- 

 ference, had 40 embryos. It is rather a significant fact that all the 

 larger individuals taken are females. Either the large males were 

 too fast for us or the females are larger or occupy more exposed 

 positions and may prove more sluggish or braver. The individuals 

 taken from July 15-November 1, 1912, showed the embryos much 

 farther advanced and some had unborn embryos 26 or more cm. long. 

 One specimen (No. 6,256) had 58 embryos, 32 on the left side and 

 26 on the right side. The normal number seems to be 35-40 embryos.

Food. — This animal will eat almost any animal which it finds in 

 the water or above it, provided it can swallow or capture it. One 

 specimen (No. 6,116) had two frogs {Rana sp.) in its stomach; 

 another (No. 6,260) had a small warmouth (Chcenobryitus gulosus) 

 and a third had other fish remains which were not to be identi- 

 fied. Five of the individuals had internal parasites in the stomach, 

 or about y of all the snakes so troubled were of this species. 



12. Tropidonotus fasciatus (Linnaeus): "Moccasin"; "Water Moccasin"; Southern Water 

 Snake; Banded Water Snake. Fig. 11. 



Ten snakes not of T. taxispilotus were taken in the swamp. These 

 are so variable in coloration and also in scutellation that we hesitate 

 to add to the confusion which obtains in the interpretation of the 

 fasciatus group. Many varieties, subspecies, geographical races, forms 

 or phases have entered the literature of North American Natrices, and 

 these are based mainly on temporal and ocular scutellation, number 

 of scale rows and coloration. These cannot all be assigned faunistic 

 or geographical areas and most of them are as yet likely to appear 

 in one region if a large series be taken. The group is very variable 

 and some of the forms designated may be variants struggling to 

 assume a stable varietal form or geographical place. As yet, how- 

 ever, this gamut of variation apparently appears independent of 

 geographical environments and is almost possible if not actually 

 existent in one region. Therefore, the safer and more conservative 

 course is to place them together and not take any Cratcegus course 

 until more certain of our ground. Intensive localized study and 

 possible breeding as well as extensive geographical collecting with 

 few personal equations seem the hopeful solution of the question. 



Coloration. — The smallest specimen (No. 6,227) in coloration is 

 T. rhomhifera Hallowell. There are 32 dorsal diamond-shaped 

 rhombs from the vent forward. These are formed by oblique bars 

 which connect the upper angles of the lateral row of spots with the 

 alternating dorsal row. The species T. rhomhifera is considered to 

 be a Mississippi Valley and Texan form, yet this specimen certainly 

 accords with Cope's and Brown's descriptions of T. rhombifera and 

 Ditmar's figure of it. Cope held that it rarely had 25 scales, but 

 Brown finds that more than half of his specimens were with 25 rows, 

 and we firmly believe 23 not out of the range of this color variation. 

 Thus, its limit clearly overlaps the supposed 23-25 range of T. 

 fasciatus. The specimen at hand has 23-23-18 scales. The venter 

 has each gastrostege yellow with the border black. Posteriorly, 

 each urostege is black-bordered, thus giving two rows of yellow spots, 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175 



and the under surface of the tail consequently looks darker than the 

 anterior ventral region. These black borders unite on either end 

 of the gastrostege and thus enclose a transverse elliptical central 

 area of yellow. Also along each end of the gastrostege opposite the 

 lateral spot of the side the gastrostegal black border encloses another 

 small area of yellow. Thus, we have a central row of transverse 

 yellow gastrostegal spots and a row on either end of smaller encircled 

 yellow spots, very much like the venter of T. compressicaudus Kenni- 

 cott (see description Brown, p. 34). This species is Floridan and 

 might enter the Okefinokee. Furthermore, T. compressicaudus 

 walkeri has 23 rows of scales as has our specimen. Finally, our 

 specimen (^rJiomhifer-Yike on dorsum except for the neck) has on the 

 neck four black longitudinal bands, the two of either side being 

 connected posteriorly. The labials are yellowish with dark borders. 

 There are no bands on the head. Many of our specimens — in fact, 

 practically all — have the tail quite strongly compressed at its base and 

 heavily carinated, and an examination of supposed T. f. erythrogaster, 

 T. f. transversa, T. cyclo^yium and T. rhombifera material from other 

 localities does not impress us that this relative character is sufficient 

 to set T. compressicaudus apart as a separate form from T. fasciatus. 

 Eight of the ten specimens have no more than 23 scales, and always 

 this number in the middle of the body; three having 23-23-19, 

 two 23-23-17, one 23-23-18, one 23-23-20, and one 21-23-19. 

 Some of these may well be T. f. pictiventris, and were so identified in 

 the field with only Cope's work at hand. This form he restricts to 

 Florida, and he has specimens from Gainesville and Palatka, not far 

 from the Okefinokee. He considers it close to T. compressicaudus 

 in coloration of the belly. But some of our specimens clearly have 

 the compressicaudus-pictiventris coloration to which there is added 

 the reddish abdominal spots of T. fasciatus fasciatus. One specimen 

 (No. 6,228) has no lateral or dorsal spots apparent, the belly an 

 immaculate salmon-pink, except under the tail where a bluish-gray 

 enters, and the scales strongly carinated — all characters of T. fasciatus 

 erythrogaster. Some specimens show the lateral space with reddish 

 or reddish-brown of T. fasciatus fasciatus. Some of the ten showed 

 the yellowish labials with strong black borders and most of these 

 individuals have the two light dots close to the suture of the occipitals. 

 One specimen (No. 6,119) is a uniform grayish or greenish-brown 

 on the back including the head which has no postocular band, and the 

 belly is whitish or yellowish-white with hardh' any suggestion of 

 gastrostegal borders (faded-out brown). Another very large speci- 




176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



men with a few reddish bars evident on the sides has a yellow venter 

 with black gastrostegal borders not strong, but on the end of each 

 gastrostege the blue-black of the back encroaches for |-f of an inch 

 and makes a striking lateral border for the yellow of the middle of 

 the venter. Finally, we have another specimen (No. 6,231) with 

 scales 21-25-21 and dorsum grayish-black above. The only marks 

 evident are transverse white dorsal bands J scale wide which become 

 less distinct as the belly is reached. The entire underparts are 

 grayish-white with gastrostegal borders grayish-black. These bor- 

 ders surrounding the urosteges make two rows of encircled spots on 

 the under surface of the tail. It is, we believe, a T. fasciatus, yet far 

 from the ordinary coloration. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These specimens vary in length 

 from 28-118.7 cm., the tail from 7.9-29 cm., or 3.5-4.5, average 

 3.7 in the whole length; gastrosteges are from 123-133, the urosteges 



6225 6116 6119 



6225 6116 6231 



Fig. 11. — Tropidonotus fasciatus (Linn.). 



from 67-85; supralabials 8; infralabials 10, rarely 11, sometimes 

 10-11 as in two specimens or 11-12 as in one; the temporals are 1-3 

 in seven specimens, in one of which on both sides the first temporal 

 has captured the normal third temporal of the second row; in No. 

 6,118 the temporals are 1-2; in No. 6,226, 1-2 on the undestroyed 

 side; in No. 6,225, 1-3 on the right side and 1-2 on the left side. 

 The oculars are 1-3 in eight specimens, but one of these (No. 6,116) 

 has the upper and lower postoculars Avith a strong start towards 

 subdivision, which if completed might give 5 oculars in all; in No. 

 6,119, the oculars are 1-2, and No. 6,231 on its undestroyed side 

 has 1-2. Thus, we see in ten specimens a strong tendency for the 

 temporal and ocular formulae to vary. The published evidence and 

 material at hand at the present date is not sufficient to determine 

 whether T. compressicaudus and its subspecies, T. bisectiis, T. fascia- 

 tus and its subspecies and T. rhombifera are other than of the T. 

 fasciatus assemblage, and thus we would be inclined to treat them 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 177 



until the group is very carefully collected, bred and studied from a 

 large series from several of their supposed geographical habitats. 



Habits. — This species was not so common as the pied water snake. 

 Like it, however, this snake is called ''water moccasin" by the 

 natives who fear it. One evening, one of us accidentally punctured 

 his thumb on the teeth of a recently killed snake of this species.. 

 The next morning several of the native family very concernedly 

 wished to see how bad the thumb would be. Unlike the pied water 

 snake, it is fairly common on the water prairies and about the edges 

 of the islets ("houses" or "heads") of the prairies. We also took 

 this species in the water ditches on the outskirts of the swamp and 

 along the lumber railroad ditches. We were unable to find a single 

 snake of this species along the larger water courses where the pied 

 water snake apparently replaces it. It seems to be more a form 

 of the moist situations on the islands and possibly in the wooded, 

 swampy parts. In disposition it is like other water snakes, but is a 

 poor second to its relative, T. taxispilotus, in pugnacity. 



Food. — It feeds largely on aquatic animals. One specimen (No. 

 6,116), taken May 30, 1912, had two frogs of the most aquatic species 

 of the swamp {Rana sp.) in its stomach and two (Nos. 6,231 and 

 6,115) had taken a southern meadow frog (Rana pipiens spheno- 

 cephala). Only one of the ten had parasites in its stomach. 



13. Storeria dekayi (Holbrook): DeKay's Snake; DeKay's Browo Snake; Little Brown Snake; 

 Brown Snake; Ground Snake; Spotted Snake; Spotted Adder; Brown Grass Snake. Fig. 12. 



Two specimens (Nos. 6,237, 6,239) were secured between July 15 

 and November 1, 1912, by Mr. Jackson Lee, of Billy's Island. This 

 form and its congener, the red-bellied snake, are commonly asso- 

 ciated with dry grounds, but certainly at some seasons within the 

 swamp it must find it impossible to find such a habitat, and it may 

 be less averse to wet situations than once thought. 



Coloration. — Both specimens have the usual grayish-brown or 

 ash-gray on the upper surface with the pale vertebral line bordered 

 by black dots. The venter is white or yellowish-white in alcohol 

 and the row of dots near either end of the gastrostege is present. 

 Besides these, there are finer clots widely separated over the whole 

 belly. The neck has a black band extending from the ends of 

 gastrosteges Nos. 3-5 across the angle of the mouth to the mid-dorsal 

 line where it meets its fellow of the other side. In front of this bar 

 a white band of belly color reaches across the sixth and seventh 

 infralabials and on the sixth and seventh supralabials. The 3d-5th 

 supralabials and the same infralabials are almost entirely black.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mar., 



Several of the other labials are with large black spots or margins. 

 The dorsal head plates of body color are with a strong sprinkling of 

 black. One specimen (No. 6,239) superficially looks almost as 

 black as the specimen of the red-bellied species did. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The gastrosteges were 135 and 138, 

 respectively; the urosteges 62 and 48. The total lengths were 

 24.4 cm. and 29.3 cm.; the tails 5.8 and 5.2 cm. or 4j and 5f in the 

 total length. There are 7 supralabials with the eye resting on the 

 3d and 4th; the infralabials 7; no loreal; temporals 1-2; anal plate 

 divided, in one specimen with a half gastrostege in front of it. The 

 oculars of No. 6,237 are 1-2 on both sides, but on the right side the 

 preocular is almost divided into two, while No. 6,239 the oculars 

 are 2-2. This character coupled with the scales 15-15-15 in both 

 specimens raises the query whether 15 or 17 rows of scales and 2 or 1

Lower figures, S. occipito- 



preoculars are constant differences between S. occipitomaculata and 

 S. dekayi as commonly held. Besides, the red-bellied specimen 

 shows greater variation in preoculars by being 3 instead of 2. 



Habits. — This species is nocturnal, spending the day beneath logs 

 and stones in rocky situations as well as in meadows. Several^ 

 times the authors have found it in low fields near a marshy stream. 



Food and Breeding. — The DeKay's snake is not wholly insectivo- 

 rous, as one specimen had 8 gastropods (shells missing) in its stomach. 

 One specimen had 17 small developing eggs, 14 being on the left 

 side. Inasmuch as this was taken after July 15, this would doubtless 

 indicate that this particular specimen of this ovoviviparous species 

 would not have given birth to young until late summer or early fall. 



14. Storeria occipitomaculata (Storer): Red-bellied Snake; Storer's Snake; Brown Snake; 

 Ground Snake; Storer's Grass Snake. 



One specimen (No. 6,238) taken on Billy's Island between July 15 

 and November 1, 1912, after our departure. This comes well within 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 179 



the range of the species. This small, largely nocturnal inhabitant 

 beneath stones, logs and other cover usually averages smaller than 

 S. dekaiji, and our specimen proves smaller than the two specimens 

 of the latter species taken in the swamp. The tail is lost, the speci- 

 men measuring 17.9 cm. to the vent. The gastrosteges are 120; 

 scales 15-15-15; temporals 1-2; supralabials 6; infralabials 7. 

 Unlike most of the descriptions, the ocular formulae are 3-2 for both 

 sides, instead of the 2 preocular condition usually noted. On the 

 right side of the head appears a small supranasal above the nostril 

 and at the common corner of the internasal, prefrontal and two 

 nasals. On the left side is a similar plate not touching the internasal. 

 Other specimens from other Georgian localities (Dr. J. C. Bradley, 

 collector) reveal no such condition, and the present specimen may 

 have had some accident, although it is not especially apparent. 



The head in front of the three occipital color spots is much darker 

 than the rest of the body; in alcohol it looks black — in fact, darker 

 than any other specimen of the species we have ever recorded. 

 The characteristic light spot of the fifth supralabial is, however, not 

 wholly obscured. This specimen, like Hay's record, had a slug in 

 its stomach and insect remains in its rectum. 



15. Haldea Striatula (Linn.): Brown Snake; Worm Snake; Ground Snake; Little Striped 

 Snake. Plate III, fig. 4. 



One specimen was secured on Billy's Island. In the Central 

 States this small snake extends from Minnesota to Texas, while in 

 the Eastern States its range from Virginia southward has not its 

 southern limit well determined. We can find no definite locus 

 beyond W. J. Taylor's (Cope, 1900, p. 1010) record for Nashville, 

 Ga., which is 50 miles northwest of the Okefinokee Swamp. Ditmars^* 

 gives it as extending to Florida, where it might well be, but in this 

 State Loennberg (1895, pp. 317-339) did not secure it. 



Coloration. — The field description of the color of this specimen is 

 as follows : Color of the back with the skin bluish and scales brownish 

 or opalescent; each scale with fine speckings, which sometimes 

 assume a black edge on the cephalic end of the scale. The color of 

 the dorsal scales extends onto the ends of the gastrosteges, fine 

 speckings accompanying it. The gastrosteges are greenish-yellow 

 or opalescent. A pinkish-like area occurs on the side of the head. 

 It crosses the last lower labial, the 4th and 5th upper labials and 

 first temporal and cephalic ends of the second row of temporals. 

 It then fades as it crosses the middle of the occipital plates. The 



34 1907. The Reptile Book, p. 271. 




180 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



venter of this adult did not impress us as salmon-colored. The 

 total length is 223 mm. and the tail 34 mm,, or 6| times in the total 

 length. In other specimens from other regions the short tail ranges 

 from 5|-7j in the total length. The longest specimen of this species 

 we have seen reached 283 mm. There is no particular deviation 

 from the normal in the scutellation of this specimen. The eye 

 rests on the 4th supralabial and on the posterior end of the third 

 supralabial. The ventral plates are 134, the subcaudals 37. 



Habits. — -This specimen was found a rod from the thick, swampy 

 cypress edge of Billy's Island. Associated with it was one of the 

 few salamanders found on the trip. The ground was decidedly 

 moist, yet the vegetation was of the pine-barren type. Inasmuch 

 as it was under the cover of a more or less disintegrated log when 

 taken (mid-forenoon), we conclude that it is distinctly a nocturnal 

 form. This specimen had no food within its alimentary tract, but 

 its habitat and previous assertions regarding its food suggest that 

 it feeds on worms, larvae of insects, etc. 



Breeding. — It is well established that this species is ovo viviparous. 

 Hay^^ (p. 397) discovered a female with 5 embryos. Strecker (p. 50)*^ 

 has a specimen with seven embryos, and Ditmars (1907, p. 272) 

 records that a captive "gave birth to seven young on the 20th of 

 August." This lone female, secured June 15, 1912, has six embryos. 

 These masses in length range from 15-18 mm.; in width from 6-7 

 mm. The membrane about each is practically transparent; the 

 embryo lays in the middle of one side presenting an apparent cephalic 

 and caudal yolk mass which actually on the opposite side proves 

 continuous from one end to the other. 



In this species we discovered no parasites, external or internal, 

 and of its enemies know nothing.

 Snake; Osten-Sacken's Snake. Fig. 13. 



Ten specimens in all were taken within the swamp. Its occurrence 

 in Okefinokee Swamp proves interesting in the light of Ruthven's 

 distribution map for this species. He considers it still a question 

 whether this species goes north of the Florida-Georgia line. Of it 

 he writes :^^

"As at present known, the range of sackeni is confined to the 

 southern part of the coastal plain, in southern Mississippi and 

 Florida. This physically recent feature with its low altitude (nowhere 

 more than a few hundred feet above sea level) is characterized by 

 scores of stagnant rivers, lakes, lagoons and swamps. The tem- 

 perature and humidity are high and the rainfall-evaporation ratio 

 exceeds 110 per cent. (Transeau, 1905). The vegetation is rich, and 

 consists of such forms as white cedar, sweet bay, magnolia, tupelo 

 gum, swamp cottonwood, cypress, Quercus texana, etc., in the swamps, 

 and several species of pines on the higher ground. As far as I have 

 been able to find, the form has never been recorded outside of Florida, 

 although Ditmars (1907, p. 219) states that it is distributed in the 

 'coast regions of South Carolina and Georgia; Florida generally.' 

 Certainly, typical sackeni may be expected to occur somewhat north 

 of the latitude of the northern boundary of Florida, but in this 

 general region it comes in contact with sauritus, and the status of 

 the two forms in the intermediate region must be examined before 

 the northern boundary of sackeni can be even approximately fixed. 

 I must confess to have examined but few specimens from the debat- 

 able region, but the fact that sauritus specimens from the coastal 

 plain from North Carohna northward show a much closer affinity 

 to sackeni than those from central Alabama would seem to indicate 

 that true sackeni pushes farther up the Atlantic coast than in the 

 interior, possibly into Georgia and South Carolina, as Ditmars 

 indicates, which might also be expected in view of its more aquatic 

 habits and its association with the coastal plain conditions through- 

 out the greater part of its range." 



Coloration. — A color description of a live specimen captured on 

 Billy's Lake is as follows: 



The venter is opalescent with an opalescent coppery brown on 

 the ends of the gasfcrosteges. In water the two lower rows of scales 

 look greenish-brassy and the lateral stripe straw-colored. The row 

 above the lateral stripe is bordered by a line of black specks; the 

 back scales are olive and the dorsal row, much like in color the two 

 lowest side rows, is defined on either side by fine black specks. The 

 dorsal row is practically absent on the caudal two-thirds of the 

 body. Black postocular stripe over the upper labials. Three other 

 specimens in life did not impress us as rich brown or dark as T. 

 sauritus and appeared more slender. 



Supplementary notes of color from alcohol and formol specimens 

 are: In some specimens, the dorsal stripe extends to a position 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



opposite the anus; in one individual also along the tail; in most, 

 however, it is prominent only on the neck. Nowhere does it have 

 the color of the lateral stripes except possibly on the neck region. 

 When the body is distended the intervals between the scales have 

 regular light specks or lines as T. sauritus. Rarely the lateral 

 stripes become more or less obscure, but not wholly absent. The 

 dorsal stripe covers the median dorsal rows and two half rows and 

 the lateral stripe is on the 3d and one half on the 4th row of scales. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The specimens vary in length from 

 31-71.5 cm. (12|-28 inches). The latter length compares favorably 

 with T. sauritus lengths, but the specimens may average smaller than 

 that species, though the average of the ten specimens is 48 cm. (19| 

 inches). The extreme slimness of the species acids to its diminutive 

 appearance. The tail ranges from 11.2-23.5 cm. in length or 2.9- 

 3.25 (average 3) times in the total length. The gastrosteges vary 

 from 149-159, average 154, where Ruthven's extreme begins and 

 almost coincident with his lower extreme for T. sauritus. In all 



6235 g235 6123 



Fig. 13. — Thamnophis sauritus sackeni (Kenn.). 



the anal plate is entire. The urosteges range from 95-114, in better 

 accord with the range of Ruthven's T. proximus and far below his 

 range for T. s. sackeni. The scale formula is 19-19-17, except in 

 one where only 19-17-17 obtains. The oculars are 1-3 except in 

 two instances, in one specimen (No. 6,123) they are 1-4 on both 

 sides, in another (No. 6,235) they are 2-3 on the right side and 

 normal on the left; the supralabials remain constantly 8 for all the 

 specimens and the eye rests on the 4th and 5th supralabials; the 

 infralabials are 10 except in two specimens where 11 were recorded 

 on the right side. The temporals are usually 1-2, rarely 1-3; if 

 the third row be counted, it may be 2 or 3 or rareh^ 4 in number. 

 All in all, the relationships of T. proximus, sauritus and sackeni 

 become closer as possible intergrading localities are studied, and no 

 distinction proves so constant as the supralabial character which 

 is not absolute. 



Habits. — This attractive snake is, to our minds, even more aquatic 

 than T. sauritus, and may be found about the open water courses, 

 on the open "prairies," along the wooded parts of the" Suwanee 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



River, in the moist situations of the wooded parts of the islands, if 

 not also in the dense cypress thickets. It is beautiful and is extremely 

 lithe of body. It frequents the edges of the little "houses" or islets 

 on the prairies, coursing among the water plants like a true water 

 snake. Of its expert swimming ability we had one fine illustration. 

 On the widest part of Billy's Lake we noticed a small snake several 

 rods ahead. It was halfway across in its course. We raced to head 

 it off, and swift and straight it did make its course. It had almost 

 reached the other shore when one of us hit at it, only to see it dive 

 deftly. It remained under water for a short time and soon re- 

 appeared on its back trail. We circled slowly towards it and when 

 near it stopped. It came immediately to the boat, apparently more 

 from curiosity than from exhaustion. This species must be accredited 

 with very good aquatic skill and endurance. 



Food. — Its food is mainly small aquatic animals. In one specimen 

 were insect remains. Frogs seem to be a prominent food with this 

 species. Four of the ten had eaten frogs, one having two southern 

 meadow frogs {Rana pipiens sphenocephala) in its stomach and 

 another had one of this same species. Another snake had captured 

 the cricket frog (Acris gryllus) and a fourth had eaten a pine-wood's 

 tree frog {Hyla femoralis), all these frogs except the last suggesting 

 an aquatic foraging ground for the species. Besides the frogs, there 

 were indications that they occasionally eat fish and other animals 

 of the water. 



Breeding. — Three specimens taken in the early part of July showed 

 the egg development to be not far advanced. One had 5 eggs, 

 another 8 and one 10. The number of young of this ovoviviparous 

 snake is comparatively few and must be born in late summer or early 

 fan. 



Parasites. — This species and its relative, T. sirtalis ordinatus, were 

 badly afflicted by internal parasites. In one specimen there were 

 parasites in the stomach, others partly in the abdominal cavity and 

 partly through the peritoneum and still others solely between the 

 peritoneum and the skin. In another specimen these occur in the 

 cephalic region and appear from the outside like large protuberances. 

 They lie just beneath the skin or imbedded in the muscles. 



17. Thamnophis sirtalis ordinatus (Linnseus): "Highland Moccasin"; Garter Snake; Com- 

 mon Garter Snake; Grass Snake; Little Green Grass Snake; Spotted Garter Snake. 



The garter snake is common in the swamp, and the local name, 

 "highland moccasin," indicates that the natives consider it more 

 upland and terrestrial than the Natrices or Thamnophis s. sackeni. 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



Coloration. — The specimens at hand all correspond very closely 

 with T. sirtalis ordinatus (Linnaeus), though our use of the sub- 

 specific name above does not commit us to full recognition of the 

 worth of this subspecies. The lateral stripe is absent or very indis- 

 tinct in one or two specimens. The dorsal stripe is very distinct in 

 only one specimen (No. 6,221). In all the others it is entirely absent 

 or indistinct. In some specimens the three rows of spots of each 

 side show very beautifully; on the venter the snakes are bluish-gray, 

 except for the throat and chin which are yellowish-white. There is a 

 black spot near the end of each gastrostege. In some specimens 

 the cephalic gastrostegal borders are black and thus connect the 

 gastrostegal spot of either end of the gastrostege. In two specimens 

 these spots are practically absent or obscured. One example, the 

 largest, is melanistic in appearance and the end of each gastrostege 

 and its gastrostegal spot is covered with the dark body color. In 

 all the supralabials are dark edged, but the infralabials are immaculate 

 except in two or three of the largest specimens, where there are dark 

 edges as on the supralabials. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The fifteen specimens vary in length 

 from 32.7-78.2 cm. (13-28^ inches); the tail is 7^17.6 cm. or 3tV- 

 4|- in the total length (average 4:^-^) ; the gastrosteges have a small 

 range from 136-146, or average 141 (ten of the fifteen have 141 or 

 140); the urosteges arc 66-77, or average 70. The scale rows are 

 very constant, being 19-19-17, except in No. 6,223 where they are 

 19-19-15; the supralabials 7; the infralabials 10 except in one case of 

 11. In all the loreal is present and the oculars are consistently 1-3, 

 except in two specimens where they are 1-4 on one side; six of the 

 specimens have the temporals 1-2 on both sides, one specimen 1-3 

 on both sides, and eight specimens with the temporals 1-2 on one 

 side and 1-3 on the other side. The anal plate is entire. 



Breeding. — Of this ovoviviparous snake we took only two females 

 with embryos developing. The largest specimen (No. 6,160), taken 

 June 26, 1912, had 25 embryos or eggs little advanced in development. 

 Another small specimen had only 8 embryos in it. From the con- 

 dition of these eggs, birth could not come before the middle of August 

 or later as with our garter of the North. 



Food. — This form was found to be one of the most terrestrial of 

 the snakes of the swamp, both in the places where captured and by 

 local reputation and by examination of their food contents. One 

 snake had eaten the small dwarf or oak toad {Bufo quercicus) and 

 another had two of this species. In two instances, the larger southern 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



toad {Bufo I. lentiginosus) proved the prey. Two others had eaten 

 the narrow-mouthed frog {Engystoma carolinense) and the pine- 

 wood's tree frog (Hyla femoralis). In two specimens many small 

 beetles were found in the stomachs with the frogs and one had 

 nothing but beetles. All except one of the specimens with food had 

 Anura, and beetles seemed the second important food of this species. 

 Parasites. — Three of these snakes were afflicted with internal 

 parasites. The natives call this species "highland moccasin," 

 because of its habitat and because of its supposed poisonous nature. 

 Certainly, it is strange that in their crude way this observing and 

 simple people should have associated it with Tropidonotus, as they 

 surely do in calling it "highland moccasin," in contradistinction 

 to "water moccasin." 



18. Ancistrodon piscivorous Lacepede: "Moccasin"; "Green-tailed Moccasin"; Water 

 Moccasin; Cotton-moutii Moccasin; Cotton-mouth; Stump-tailed Moccasin. Fig. 14. 



The water moccasin is common in the swamp. In the three 

 collections from the swamp we have sixteen specimens, seven taken 

 between May 29- July 15, 1912, seven from Julj^ 15-November 1, 

 1912, and two taken in the fall of 1913. 



Coloration.- — -The smallest specimen taken, measuring 38.3 cm., 

 shows a decided similarity to A. contortrix in coloration, only the body 

 color is more brownish than the light brown or drab of the copper- 

 head. There are thirty-two vertical bars in twos, these individual 

 bars being one or two scales wide. In the cephalic half of the body 

 two bars of one side alternate with two of the other side. Two bars 

 form a diamond inclosing an area of the lighter body color. In this 

 lighter area there is usually a small spot of color like the bars. In 

 the caudal half of the body the two bars of one side may be opposite 

 two of the other side and unite across the back, making a cross-band. 

 On the tail are seven cross-bands. The caudal half of the tail, both 

 dorsum and venter, is greenish-yellow in this small specimen. This 

 stage of the moccasin the natives consider another species, "the 

 green-tailed moccasin." Opposite the intervals between two sets 

 of bars and opposite the space inclosed by two bars there is on the 

 end of the gastrostege a black spot 1| the width of the gastrostege. 

 In the front half of the body the black spots of one side of the venter 

 alternate with those of the other side. In the caudal region where 

 the sets of bars are opposite each other as are the intervals, these 

 gastrostegal spots also are opposite, merge and are not so conspicuous. 

 As the snakes get older the dark ventral blotches become less dis- 

 tinct and the yellow or yellowish-white ground color of the venter 




186 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mar., 



more dominant, the cross-bands of the back ahiiost disappear or 

 persist last in the cephalic half of the body, also occasionally near 

 the anus. In all (except two) of the large specimens the tail is 

 perfectly black on the venter, and this usually extends ahead of the 

 anus for 20-30 gastrosteges; in one large specimen (No. 6,214) the 

 same ventral area both ahead of the anus and on the underside of the 

 tail was merely heavily blotched with black. In the young speci- 

 mens the labials are heavily marked with rich brown which is more 

 or less obscure in adults. Usually the upper labials in the adults 

 are immaculate or with few dark spots, but the infralabials retain 

 more or less of the brownish markings of the young stage. The 

 postocular brown band bordered below by the yellowish labial line 

 and above by a pale streak is persistent in all.

Dimensions and Variations. — These specimens vary in length 

 from 38.3-96.7 cm., the tail 6.5-15.1 cm., or usually 6 times in the 

 total length, the range being 5|-6j times; the gastrosteges are 

 133-144, the average 141; the urosteges 45-52, the average 48; 

 anal entire; usually the first urostege is divided, then follows 25-30 

 entire individual urosteges, with the remaining caudal ones divided. 

 The strongly keeled scale rows range from 28-25-23 to 25-25-21, 

 in all the count being 25 around the middle of the body; usually the 

 supralabials are 8 in number, five of the sixteen specimens, however, 

 have variations. One has 7 on the right side and 9 on the left side, 

 two specimens 9 and 8 and two 8 and 7; the 3d and 6th supralabials 

 are largest; eye resting on the 3d, except in three instances where 

 9 supralabials occur. Then, the eye rests on the 4th, because the 

 extralabial comes in the normal second or third area. The approach 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



to Toxicophis pugnox B. and G. is carried even closer in several. 

 In No. 6,210 with 7-8 supralabials the triangular point of the second 

 labial has been forced just above the labial border on the right side 

 and on the left side just reaches it; in Nos. 6,213 on the left side 

 and 6,133 on the right side it enters the labial border, while in No. 

 6,129 the point is just excluded from the border. The infralabials 

 range from 10-11, the latter number predominating. Besides the 

 inferior loreal, this species occasionally has another loreal in front 

 of the pit, as in the copperhead, and the absence of this plate is not so 

 constant for A. piscivorus as it might be thought. In No. 6,215 

 it appears on both sides cut off from supralabial No. 2; in No. 6,127 

 it appears on the left side; in Nos. 6,130 and 6,132 it is on the right 

 side. Thus, in five of the sixteen this distinguishing character 

 between A. contortrix and A. piscivorus appears in the latter. The 

 temporals may be 2-2, 3-3, 4:-A, 4-5, 5-4, 6-4, 6-5. The oculars 

 are usually 2-3, though 2-2, 2-4, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 and 4-3 also occur. 



Habits. — The "moccasin" is the Crotaline snake of the swamp. 

 It frequents the thickety edges of the cypress ponds on the islands, 

 occurs around the wooded edges of the water stretches and where 

 the woods of the island's border meet the piney woods, also along 

 th€ water-courses and quite generally through the swamp. On the 

 prairies they are not so common as in the wet, woody parts. They 

 lie on the little hummocks above the water and slide in at one's 

 approach. The Okefinokee Swamp is no place for the collector 

 wdio has been reared in harmless snake country where the method 

 of capture is to step on your prey. One of the authors instinctively 

 tried it on a supposed T. taxispilotus, and fortunately just missed 

 one of the biggest of the sixteen moccasins captured. They are 

 rather sluggish, yet those who know poisonous snakes handle them 

 very carefully. In spite of the presence of so many moccasins, the 

 children go barefoot. On the hunting trips for bear and deer the 

 men of the Lee family frequently travel all day barefoot, and Mr. 

 Bryant Lee has twice been bitten in the large toe by a moccasin. 

 In such cases, usually the dogs which are ahead avoid the snake, but 

 the hunters immediately behind step on them. In both of these 

 injuries the patient's leg and part of his side swelled to twice their 

 normal proportions. He recovered from both experiences. These 

 simple people could find no cure for it and in the second case thought 

 some ''Cuban relief" efficacious. We suspect the ingredients of 

 this nostrum to be alcohol, although we are not positive of it. The 

 presence of such creatures as alligators, alligator snappers and 




188 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mai., 



moccasins do not deter the family from swimming. One day our 

 whole camp and the male members of the Lee family took a swim 

 at Billy's Lake landing, and soon a moccasin swam from one hummock 

 to another through the party's midst and the snake was captured 

 as well. In another instance one of the small boys came into camp 

 Avith a large dead moccasin in one hand and a live spreading adder 

 in the other. Upon inquiry we found that the boys went in bathing 

 in a small pool 2x6 feet near their house only to find two large 

 moccasins there before them. One they killed, the other escaped. 

 These side lights which we would think make life precarious shows 

 how the natives view existence in such an environment. None 

 of our specimens is more than 6| inches in circumference, but the 

 Lees assert that they reach 9 or 10 inches or even more. This 

 snake is dangerous, pugnacious and ill-natured if tormented or 

 pinned beneath a log or pushed into a corner, and care needs to be 

 exercised after your game is supposedly dead, for the striking pro- 

 pensity is one of the last to leave the reflexive dead reptile. As 

 one member of the party, a hater of snakes, said, "After it is dead, 

 give it two more licks for safety's sake." 



Breeding. — This snake is ovoviviparous. Two females taken 

 June 10 and 22, 1912, respectively, each (Nos. 6,131, 6,130) had 5 

 embryos not far advanced. Another taken June 12, 1912 (No. 

 6,127), had IQ embryos in about the same stage, and another specimen 

 (No. 6,213) taken between July 15 and November 1, 1912, had 5 

 embryos, some of which were not far from hatching. 



Food. — The food of this species is considered to be fish, frogs and 

 other aquatic animals. They seek the transient pools of the islands 

 for stranded killifishes and tadpoles. One individual had a young 

 soft-shelled turtle {Platijpeltis ferox) in its stomach and others 

 fish remains. The other individuals had each a frog (Rana sp.) in the 

 stomach. 



Parasites. — Several of the snakes had in the stomach and intes- 

 tines parasites among the food and at other times the parasites 

 alone. In fact, only the spreading adder excelled it in the number 

 of specimens with parasites, six of the sixteen moccasins having 

 them and these six being } of all the snakes thus afflicted.

 1913, by Prof. J. C. Bradley and Paul Battle.

Coloration. — In coloration they agree very well with the descrip- 

 tions for the species, the red vertebral line being very conspicuous^ 

 as are the three rows of alternating black spots of either side. The 

 venter is whitish with numerous black blotches and spots.

In all the loreal between preocular and postnasal is present; the 

 ocular ring of scales from 6-9 in number; the anal entire. 



Habits. — This species apparently appears second in abundance 

 of the four Crotalids recorded in the swamp, the moccasin exceeding- 

 it in abundance. It was the first form of the four to be seen and 

 the first specimen was stepped upon and calmly picked up back 

 of the neck by one member of the party, he not being aware that 

 it was poisonous at all. 



Breeding. — Like the other poisonous Crotalids this species is 

 ovoviviparous, but the number of young is few, usually from five to 

 nine being the range. One 14-inch specimen (No. 6,243) taken 

 between July 15-November 1, 1912, has eight medium-sized embryos, 

 the caudal one being the smallest. Another, the largest specimen 

 (19 inches long), taken September, 1913, has nine embryos. 



Food. — This species is supposed to feed on frogs and field mice. 

 One individual had in its rectum the remains of several beetles, 

 grasshoppers, spiders and the ribs and pieces of skin of a very small 

 snake or lizard. Another specimen had in its stomach the hind 

 legs and tail of the ground lizard {Lygosoma laterale), the tail pointing 

 forward. This conforms to the rule with almost all the snakes of 

 the Okefinokee collection. In almost every instance vertebrate 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



food is swallowed head first. The largest spechnen (No. 6,251) 

 had the stomach full of parasites and in the intestine just back of 

 the stomach were a few more. 



20. Crotalus adamanteus Beauvais : Diamond Rattlesnake ; Diamond-back Rattlesnake ; 



" Rattlesnake." 



One specimen was taken during our stay in the swamp. On June 



21, 1912, Mr. Jackson Lee secured it in the late afternoon in the 



Pocket. His dog had discovered it and Mr. Lee "crooned" (threw 

 a chunk) it with a chunk of wood, but the rattles were broken off 

 in the process. The specimen must have been 4|-5 feet long, for 

 the leng-th to the anus is 115 cm. The gastrosteges are 181; anal 

 entire; scales 29-27-21; three rows of scales between suboculars 

 and labials; seven rows between supraoculars which are transversely 

 ridged; loreal, one on the right side and two on the left side. Two 

 or three other diamond-backs were killed on the west border of the 

 swamp near Fargo while we were in the swamp. 



This largest of our poisonous snakes proves a serious economic 

 factor to the inhabitants of Okefinokee Swamp. The Lees assert 

 that in 1910 alone they lost 10-15 head of hogs killed by this species 

 and other rattlers. In some seasons the rattlers and bears com- 

 bined compel the Lees to go outside the swamp for new hog stock. 

 They further contend that hogs are not wholly immune, but that 

 the hogs will eat dead rattlers, preferring the heads. At other 

 times they eat the heads first and later the body, or in some instances 

 the whole snake at once. They are not so certain that the hogs are 

 such mortal enemies of the rattlers as they are reputed to be. In 

 some seasons the rattlers are very common; during the season of 1912 

 they were scarce, as the one capture shows. They occur throughout 

 the swamp. On Minne Lake Islands they are frequent. Doubtless 

 this is due to the infrequent visits of the swamp's inhabitants who 

 almost invariably record them there on their hunting trips, having 

 counted as many as 14 on one expedition. On our last trip to the 

 Minne Lake Islands one of the native dogs was bitten by a rattle- 

 snake, Ijut reached Billy's Island two days after our arrival. It 

 travelled two miles throughout the thickest swampy tangle of the 

 swamp, swam Billy's Lake and appeared with its fore leg badly 

 swollen from the bite, but it soon recovered, as they frequently but 

 not always do. 



21, Crotalus horridus Linnaeus: Banded Rattlesnake; Timber Rattlesnake; Common Rattle- 

 snake; Rattlesnake; Cane Rattler; Cane-brake Rattler; " Siminole Rattler." 



One specimen was recorded June 25, 1912, by Prof. J. C. Bradley 

 and Mr. P. Battle on the short-cut trail to Gallberry Island. The 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



snake was about 5 feet long. In the collection made by Messrs. 

 Jackson and Lemuel Lee, July 15-November 1, 1912, we have a fine 

 specimen, ^he other specimen was secured in the fall of 1913 by 

 J. C. Bradley and Paul Battle. 



Coloration. — The coloration of the- larger specimen (No. 6,255) 

 is a pinkish-gray. In the cephalic end of the body there is on either 

 side of the back and sides a series of three rows of alternate spots 

 for a distance corresponding to four zigzag bands. The upper row 

 of each side is separated from the one of the other side by a reddish- 

 yellow band 3 scales wide which runs along the middle of the back 

 for quite a distance until the chevron bands begin. Then it con- 

 tinues along the back between the chevron spots almost to the anus. 

 This dorsal band shows better in the small specimen (No. 6,250). 

 Beyond the series of three rows of alternating spots on the neck 

 region come three bands which have not the lower row of spots 

 united with them. Then follows 18 zigzag cross-bands to the anus 

 and 4 on the tail, which is not completely black. The first of these 

 four does not completely encircle the tail as the subsequent ones 

 do. In the smaller specimen there are 5 black bands on the tail, 

 the first three not complete on the venter, and ahead of the anus 

 there are 26 bands, six of which are not wholly united. The median 

 point of the chevron is directed backward and the angle on the 

 sides points forward, the latter point usually being on the 7th-9th 

 row of scales. The black bands are 2 scales Avide and the ground- 

 color intervals 5-6 scales wide. Occasionally half black bands 

 appear with no counterpart on the other side. The venter is 

 lighter than the back, j-et heavily speckled with the ground color 

 of the back. These specimens well agree with the so-called cane- 

 brake form of the South. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The total length of the larger speci- 

 men is 118.7 cm., the tail 14.5 cm., or 8| in the total length, and with 

 14 rattles; anal entire; gastrosteges 178; the urosteges 22; scales 

 26-24-20; oculars 7; supralabials 14, the 4th the largest; infralabials 

 18 on the right side and 17 on the left side; two loreals. The smaller 

 specimen is 38.5 cm. long; the tail 3.3 cm., or llf in the total length; 

 anal entire; scales 27-(23-25)-21; orbital ring 8 on one side and 

 7 on the other side; infralabials 14. In both specimens there are 

 three rows of scales between the eye and the supralabials; the 

 larger specimen has the first row of body scales smooth. 



The natives described to us a large rattler as large as a diamond- 

 backed rattler and called it the "Siminole rattler," which we pro- 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



visionally identified as C. horridus, and later Prof. J. C. Bradley's 

 capture verified this identification in the fall of 1913. On Mixon's 

 Hammock, Jmie 16, 1912, we also found beneath an o^ I roof on the 

 ground the cast skin of this species.

PRATICOLELLA. 



BY E. G. VANATTA. 



An examination of the anatomy of several United States land 

 mollusks, which were supposed to belong to the genus Polygyra, has 

 made it necessary to transfer them to the genus PraticoleUa. The 

 species may be distinguished as follows: 



PraticoleUa griseola (Pfr.). 



Helix griseola Pfr., Symb. Hist. Hel., I, p. 41 (1841). 



This is a white shell with spiral brown bands, a thin lip, and 

 obscure microscopic spiral striae upon the apex. The anatomy is 

 unknown. 



PraticoleUa berlandieriana (Moric). Fig. 1. 



Helix (Helocogena) berlandieriana Moric, Mem. Soc. Hist. Nat. Geneve, 

 VI, p. 537, pi. 1, fig. 1 (1833). 



A species similar in color and sculpture to the preceding, but with 

 a very thick lip. The genitalia (fig. 1) of a specimen in the collection 

 of The Academy of Natural Sciences, No. 76,209, from Victoria, 

 Tex., collected by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, has a very long, hollow, 

 finger-shaped, somewhat glandular appendix upon the penis. The 

 verge is shorter than in P. pachyloma Mke. The penis retractor is 



divided, so that the largest branch is united to the apex of the phallus 

 and two smaller branches are attached at the base of the penial 

 gland with the vas deferens passing between. The surface of the 

 interior of the verge is longitudinally plicate, while that of the 

 appendix is granular. The spermatheca bulb is oval.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



195 



Praticolella pachyloma (Mke.). Fig. 2. 



Helix -pachyloma Mke., Zeitsch. fiir Mai., IV, p. 32 (1847). 



This shell is globose, translucent corneous, with a white'lip and 

 very obscure microscopic spiral strise on the apex. The genitalia 

 (fig. 2) of a specimen. No. 104,75-1, A. N. S. Phila., from Seabrook, 

 Tex., collected by Mr. H. H. Wenzel, has a rather short, hollow, 

 finger-shaped, somewhat glandular appendix. The verge is long 



and much folded. The surface of the interior of the phallus and 

 the penial gland is granular and. without longitudinal plications. 

 The penis retractor has two subequal branches, one united to the 

 apex of the verge and the other attached at the base of the penial 

 gland. The vas deferens is long, folded and bound to the phallus 

 hj the branch of the retractor muscle at base of the appendix. The 

 spermatheca bulb is reniform. 



Praticolella mobiliana (Lea). Fig. 3. 



Helix mobiliana Lea, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc, II, p. S2 (1841). 



It is usually smaller and more depressed than the preceding species, 

 and is translucent l^rown, with a deep groove back of the broadly 

 reflexed lip which often has a 

 reddish tinge. The apex has 

 very obscure microscopic spiral 

 strise. The genitalia (fig. 3) 

 of a specimen in the Acad- 

 emy's collection. No. 106,000, 

 from near Mobile, Ala., col- 

 lected by Mr. H. P. Loding, 

 has a conical penis with a 

 padlike penial gland on one- 

 side. The retractor muscle is attached to the apex of the penis. 

 The vas deferens is rather short. The thin-walled phallus and its 

 appendix are longitudinally corrugated within; the convex side of 

 the penial gland is glandular as in P. pachyloma Mke., but it is not

[Apr., 



long and finger-shaped. I propose a new section, Farragutia, for 



this species. 



Praticolella mobiliana floridana n- var. Figs. 4, 5, 6. 



This is a form which differs from the typical P. mohiliana Lea by 

 having a peculiar callus on the lip, as shown in the figures.

Praticolella bakeri n. sp. Figs. 7, 8, 9. 



Shell globose, translucent, corneous, rather grayish above the 

 periphery; spire moderately elevated; whorls 5; suture impressed; 

 surface rather dull, with irregular growth striae, indistinct spiral lines 

 and peculiar obliciue microscopic lines; apex obtuse, with obscure 



microscopic spiral striae and about 10 or 12 spaced spiral lines; 

 umbilicus small; aperture rounded-lunate; upper lip straight; outer 

 and basal lips reflexed, red with a pink callus within and an orange- 

 red band in the shallow groove back of the peristome; parietal 

 callus thin.

differs from P. pachijloma Mke. by the sculpture of the apex and 

 the shallower groove back of the peristome. Unfortunately, the 

 animal was lost, but from notes made at the time of cleaning the 

 shell, the genitalia were similar to those of P. jejuna Say, but with 

 a very short finger-shaped penial gland. 



Praticolella lawae (Lewis). Fig. 10. 



Helix {Mesodon) lawii Lewis, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1874, p. 118. 

 This species has a pustulate apex and a parietal tooth. The 

 genitalia (fig. 10) of a specimen in the 

 collection of the Academy, No. 90,722, (^ '^P; 

 from Calera, Ala., collected by Mr. 

 H. H. Smith and presented by Mr. 

 G. H. Clapp, has a hollow penial 

 gland. The verge is rather short and 

 abruptly folded at the insertion of the 

 appendix and half way between this 

 point and the attachment of the long 



retractor muscle at the apex. The vas deferens is rather short. The 

 interior of the verge and the hollow penial gland is longitudinally 

 corrugated, while the convex side of the appendix is thick, and 

 granular on the inner surface. The spermatheca bulb is oval.

THE EARLIEST SAMOAN PRINTS. 

 BY WILLIAM CHURCHILL. 



The ethnica of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition (1837-1841) 

 underwent a series of disasters of such gravity that it is sur- 

 prising that anything was preserved. The official collections, 

 knowTi to have been of great magnitude and unrivalled importance, 

 were lost in the wreck of one of the vessels of the squadron on the 

 Columbia bar in Oregon. A surrogate collection was hastil}'' 

 assembled by Wilkes by annexing the specimens which had come 

 into the possession of officers and men. This second and inferior 

 collection reached Washington in 1842, vanished from sight for 

 fifty years and was not discovered until 1892,^ when I had the melan- 

 choly pleasure of installing in the National Museum all that had 

 survived the decay of half a century. All the perishable materials 

 had by that time gone into the end-products of decomposition. 



When the squadron put into Botany Bay, after completing the 

 survey of the islands from Tahiti to Fiji, the members of the civilian 

 scientific staff were landed as a matter of convenience, while the 

 naval officers went upon their dash toward the South Pole and the 

 discovery of Antarctica, only recently confirmed. In the civil 

 staff was Titian R. Peale, a young member of an old and respectable 

 family of Philadelphia. It is through him that The Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is in possession of one of the best 

 collections of Polynesian ethnica any^vhere in the world. Others 

 are larger, but none is so seriously representative of the period before 

 foreign contamination had been introduced. The records show 

 little of the manner in which Peale's collection escaped the com- 

 mandeering by Wilkes after the disaster at the Columbia; but 

 it is evident that Peale landed his treasures when he went ashore 

 at Botany Bay and that thence he secured transport by way of 

 London to the United States. In due course of time he deposited 

 these important objects with The Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, in his home to^vn, where now they are displayed in a 

 satisfactory manner and are available through the courtesy of the 

 Academy for purposes of study.

 under many tons of incombustible coal.

Specimen No. 10,615 in the Peale Collection is a pile of small 

 basketry from Samoa, half a dozen pieces of the common envelope 

 type still in Samoan use. It is labelled "School Satchel." In 

 connection with the date, 1839, this label led me to comment that 

 at that time it would be somewhat proleptic to use the designation 

 School Satchels, in view of the fact that the mission had then scarcely 

 secured a foothold in Samoa. In continuation I informed the Curator 

 that basketry of that size and form was intended to hold leaf tobacco 

 and dry banana leaves for cigarettes, for I have been assured by James 

 Dwight Dana that tobacco was found indigenous in the South Sea. 

 Handling the satchel which lay on top of the heap, I noticed that it 

 weighed more than I should expect, and that led to my discovery of 

 printed matter contained therein. 



So far as my information extends, these pieces of printed matter 

 are absolutely unique. I have assured myself that they do not 

 exist in mission collections in Samoa, nor yet at the home of the 

 London Missionary Society; they are not in the British Museum, 

 nor can I find them of record in any library custody. It is an infer- 

 ence, but there is much to commend it, that these pieces constitute 

 a complete collection of Samoan prints up to the time of the visit of 

 the Wilkes expedition in 1839. It would appear that Peale displayed 

 an interest in the work of the mission, and a natural response on the 

 part of those who were laboring in that field would be to supply as 

 complete a collection as possible to show what they had already 

 accomplished. 



The following memoranda will serve to identify the several pieces 

 in necessary bibliographic detail :

This is a mutilated copy: signature 1 has lost pages 5-8, leaving 

 torn edges. The signature was made up in duodecimo and on page 

 12 is the footline, Printed at the Wesleyan Mission Press, Vavau, 

 Feb. 1838 (W. A. ] Brooks. The second signature continues Chapter 

 VII of Saint Matthew's Gospel at verse 7 and runs through pages 

 independently numbered 1-6, the remainder torn out. 



Both the foregoing titles are bound in a stiff paper cover, blue 

 on pages 1 and 4, the white inner pages 2 and 3 show parts of a 

 catechism or book of Bible questions in Fijian containing pages 



10, 15 and 18 complete, together with the upper six lines of pages 



11, 14 and 19. 



These prints are interesting as showing the movement of the 

 press in the South Seas. We note the items. 




202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



Huahine imprint. The first press in the South Seas was brought 

 to Tahiti by the London Missionary Society about 1818 on the 

 restoration of their work following the failure of the first settlement 

 of the party which was sent out to Tahiti, Tonga and the Marquesas 

 on the Duff "in 1799. The first three items in this list do not, there- 

 fore, represent the first product of the press in Tahiti, for a con- 

 siderable mass of literature had by 1837 been accumulated in Tahitian. 

 But they do show that when the need first arose for religious prints 

 in the evangelization of Samoa, it was necessary to employ the 

 Tahiti press at Huahine as being the only one accessible. John 

 Williams began his mission in Samoa in 1835 by a brief visit and 

 returned in 1837; it is clear that the first three items were the product 

 of his learning somewhat of the Samoan language in his first visit 

 and that on his return to Tahiti he made this provision for his perma- 

 nent settlement. 



Rarotoga imprint. A second and better press was received in 

 Tahiti in 1837 and the old machine then became available for the 

 new mission in Rarotonga which had been established by John 

 Williams on his way to Samoa in 1835. To this we owe items 4 and 5. 



Upolu imprint. A new press was sent out from London in 1839 

 for the Samoan mission, and the Rev. John B. Stair was detailed to 

 that field because of his knowledge of practical printing. It is not 

 unreasonable to infer that the broadside of Psalms (item 6) is the 

 first sheet run off the Samoan press, and that item 7 was the next, 

 for we note that these two items use Roman numerals with points 

 for the date and that it is not until we reach item 8 that we find 

 Arabic numerals. That the Samoan printery was fairly well equipped 

 we observe from the fact that items 7 and 8 are the only ones stitched 

 or covered in the Polynesian series. 



Vavau imprint. Less is known of the introduction of the press 

 into Tonga. Item 9 shows that it was used for the printing of 

 religious material for the mission in Fiji, which was subordinate to 

 the Wesleyan establishment in Tonga. That this alphabetary and 

 fragment of the Gospel of Saint Matthew was not the first Fijian 

 product of that press is evidenced by the fact that the binding shows 

 the use of wasted sheets of a former print. - 



2 Included in the same parcel is an undated specimen from another linguistic 

 province. This is a small square octavo of six signatures without page numbers, 

 stitched with fiber, bound with famihar Chinese red paper. The title occupies 

 the upper third of page 1, as follows: Pinag Daanang Buhay nang | Princesa 

 Adriana sa Caharian | nang Antioquia at nang | Principe Pantinople | sa 

 Francia. This translation of a Spanish Novelette into one of the Philippine 

 languages was undoubtedly acquired by Peale when the expedition visited the 

 Sulu Islands.

NOTES ON NEMATOGNATHOUS FISHES. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



The present account comprises an annotated list, with descrip- 

 tions of several "new species, belonging to the Ostariophysian order 

 Nematognathi, contained in the collection of the Academy. 



SILURID^. 

 TACHYSURIN.'E. 



Felichthys pinnimaculatus (Steindachner). 



One from Panama. 

 Felichthys marinus (Mitchill). 



Harvey Cedars, Great Egg Harbor, Corson's Inlet, Sea Isle City, 

 New Jersej^; Womita Haulover, Nicaragua. 



Galeichthys felis (Linnseus). 



Bayport and Big Pine Key, Florida. 



Selenaspis herzbergii (Bioch). 



One example 137 mm. long from Dutch Guiana (Dr. C. Hering). 

 This closel}' resembles Hexanematichthys hymenorrhinus Bleeker^ 

 from "Guatimala, " a species not included in Regan's work on 

 Central American fishes, and usually merged with the present as a 

 synonym. My specimen agrees largely with Bleeker's figure of 

 H. hymenorrhinus, though he does not show the lateral line with 

 subequal, short, backwardly directed branches along its lower edge. 

 The teeth are shown differently on the palatines, as in my specimen 

 they are in enlarged and more approximate areas. My example 

 shows the internasal cutaneous ridge incomplete or only developed 

 at the sides, and the gill-rakers 8 + 15, while Eigenmann and Eigen- 

 mann give but 6 + 10 for S. herzbergii. 



Another example, young, from Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana (Dr. 

 C. Hering), representing Netuma dubia Bleeker. It has a distinct 

 cutaneous ridge uniting the hind nostrils, a character not shown in 

 Bleeker's figure.^ The maxillary barbels are also shorter, and do 

 not quite reach to the ventrals.

This species seems representative of Rhamdia quelen (Quoy and 

 Gaimard) from eastern Brazil and the La Plata, and agrees largely 

 in its long adipose fin. From R. humilis (Giinther) from Venezuela,- 

 with which it was formerly identified, it differs in the longer adipose 

 fin. It also differs from R. cinerascens (Giinther) from western 

 Ecuador and R. pentlandi (Valenciennes) from the Peruvian Andes 

 in similar fashion. 



Rhamdia mounseyi Regan,^ from the Ucayali River, has the occipital 

 process extending f to the dorsal, origin, the gill-rakers 2 or 3 + 5

 redescription of the type shows that this species is probably not

P. vaillanti, according to Regan's key, where the character shared 



in common is "supraoccipital bordered posteriorly by a median 



scute, and by one or more on each side." It differs from all three 



of these species in having the 1. 1. 30, and the lateral keels weak.

 agreement with Steindachner's figure of Loricaria stuhelii.-^ The 

 interorbital space, in my specimens, is flat, with the eye nearly 

 impinging on the upper profile of the head. In Bleeker's figure the 

 interorbital space is shown as elevated. My examples agree with 

 L. stubelii in their occipital armament, though ventrally they have 

 at least four rows of plates. In L. stubelii the figure shows the 

 median ventral plates absent in one case. Traces of dark spots are 

 also evident on the fins.

This example is close to Loricariichthys maculatus (Bloch), and 

 may ultimately be found identical. Bloch's poor figure-^ does not 

 show much detail fit for comparison, and the synonymous Loricaria 

 amazonica Castelnau^^ is not much better. The snout, in Ijoth cases, 

 is shown as more obtuse, similar to my examples of Loricariichthys 

 typus. From Regan's description, my specimen differs in the 

 longer snout and the abdomen with but a single series of plates 

 between the lateral series. The carinate anterior plates are also 

 characteristic, as his specimens are given at 190 mm. in length, and 

 said to have all the predorsal plates weakly carinate in the young 

 and without distinct keels in the adult.

COLD-BLOODED VERTEBRATES FROM FLORIDA, THE WEST INDIES, 

 COSTA RICA, AND EASTERN BRAZIL. 



BY HENRY \V. FOWLER. 



The Academy has received a number of small collections from the 

 above countries during the past ten years, which I have recently 

 studied. Some include interesting records or new species, and 

 thus they are gathered together to form the present paper. I am 

 indebted to Dr. Thomas Barl^our for a review of the amphibians 

 and reptiles listed. 



Florida. 



The most important collections from this State were made during 

 several winters, in 1904-5, 1906, and 1907, by the late George Bacon 

 Wood, while at West Palm Beach. The marine species were all 

 collected on the ocean front at Palm Beach. Mr. Wood sent photo- 

 graphs or drawings of many of the larger and more abundant and 

 he also ascertained the vernacular names when possible, which are 

 given below in quotations. Under date of March 26, 1909, Mr. 

 Wood wrote me of an example of Trachypterus recently taken 

 in a net in the sea. He says it measured 7 feet 2 inches in length 

 and was 14 inches in depth. Later this example was noted in Forest 

 atid Stream, LXXII, May, 1909, p. 699, with a photograph, and 

 doubtfully referred to as T. gryphuriis. It was not secured for the 

 Academy. 



Lieutenant Hugh Willoughby made a collection at Stuart, in 

 Dade County, in 1908. A small collection was made at Lake Kerr, 

 in Marion County, and along the St. Johns River, in 1909, b}^ 

 Mr. John Trimble. Mr. Morgan Hebard collected some amphibians 

 in southern Florida in 1910. In 1912 and subsequently, Mr. 0. F. 

 Bajaiard collected some interesting material at Clearwater, in 

 Hillsboro County. Dr. H. A. Pilsbry obtained several species there 

 in 1904, though unless otherwise indicated, the records pertain to 

 Mr. Baynard. During the winter of 1914 ]\Ir. F. J. Keeley collected 

 a few fishes at Hawks Park, in \'olusia County.

 noted two other sharks' not preserved, Ginglijmostoma cirratum and 

 Galeocerdo tigrinus, at Boca Grande Pass, the first apparently not 

 before recorded from the east coast. I may also mention that a 

 large example of Rhineodon tijpus A. Smith, was taken at Knight's 

 Key on Jmie 1, 1912, though it has already been recorded by Dr. 

 Gudger. I examined it while on exhibition, in August, 1913, at 

 Atlantic City, N. J.

 from the St. Johns River, and also Amiatus calvus, from the 

 Ocklawaha. 



Tarpon atlanticus (Valenciennes). 



]\Ir. Wood obtained this species at New River, Indian River 

 and Boca Grande Pass, and Mr. Keeley reports it from about 

 Hawks Park. 



During 1913, from April 25 to May 7, Mr. Herman T. Wolf made 

 the following interesting measurements (in inches) from 21 examples, 

 freshly killed, from Boca Grande and Captiva Pass, and the Caloosa- 

 hatchee.

In all these examples Mr. Wolf found the belly rounded, the tubes 

 of the 1. 1. much branched, the dorsal always inserted behind the 

 ventrals, and but few color variations. He writes: "River fish are 

 darker in color and may be distinguished at once: the scales are 

 yellowish or yellow, in marked contrast to the brilliant mat-silver 

 of the fish taken in the Gulf and passes. The color is not due to a 

 nuptial change, more probably a muddy-water discoloration or 

 effect of fresh water. Fishes varying greatly in weight swim in the 

 same schools. The smallest tarpon taken in these passes weighed 

 26f pounds, the record largest fish 210 pounds. It is girth and 

 condition, more than length, that controls the weight of a tarpon. 

 The best catches are made at full and new moon, day and night 

 fishing. From May 10 to the end of July they are most numerous 

 in the passes. Tarpon have been observed cleaning spawning-beds, 

 but no spawn or young have been taken. The beds are made in 

 rivers and sheltered bays of brackish and fresh water, in the Caloosa- 

 hatchee and Peace Rivers, etc. "

This species is allied, if not likely to prove identical, with Scarus 

 radians Valenciennes, as interpreted by Jordan and Evermann. 

 Sparisoma radians- thus differs in the presence of 4 posterior canines, 

 its reddish-brown color, axil with little or no blue, but with a dusky 

 blotch partly hidden by the fin, caudal nearly plain, and one or two 

 more or less distinct whitish bars across the chin. Scarus lacrimosus 

 Poey is too imperfectly described to permit of positive identification, 

 though the pectoral is without an axillary spot. Jordan notes^ a 

 specimen sent by Poey to Cambridge, which had no dark axillary 

 spot, the head plain, though it possessed two strong posterior canines 

 with several smaller pointed teeth in front. At present Sparisoma 

 abbotti has a dusky front and throat, on each side of the cheek below 

 a whitish horizontal area which does not extend across the chin. 

 Behind the dark area of the throat the scales on the isthmus form a 

 pale or whitish transverse streak completely across.

Cartago. Dr. Calvert gives the following note: 



"There was an exceedingly handsome frog here, one of which we 

 took to the hotel and kept for some days. When "asleep" its body,, 

 exclusive of legs, is 63 mm. (2h ins.) long. Ordinarily the upper 

 surface of body and legs is a bright pea-green, below the body is 

 speckled white and reddish-brown, with a band of brilliant beautiful 

 blue on each side of the abdomen. We photographed it as we noticed 

 great color changes. When first caught it was pale green. When 

 we took it out of the vasculum at the hotel it was a dark dirty green 

 with pale spots on the back. While we photographed it, it grew 

 light again with paler spots over the back. After night-fall it was 

 again very dark, but although it spent the night in a dark cupboard 

 it was pale green when we first looked at it in the morning and again 

 at 4.30 P.M. When caught it secreted a quantity of sticky mucus 

 having a powerful and disagreeable odor, which it was difficult to 

 remove from the hands. It was able to cling without other support 

 than its toes on the vertical side of our glass graduate. The tips 

 of all the toes (4 on front, 5 on hind feet) are expanded into large 

 fleshy disks with which the frog climbs."

During November of 1913, Mr. C. F. Derby made a small collection 

 in the Rio Jaguribe at Barro Alto, in the municipality of Igatu, and 

 about 413 kilometers due south from Fortaleza. When the fishes 

 were captured the water in the river was a trifle salty, owing to a 

 very light rainy season the year before.

 of the color. Prof. Starks states that Madeira River specimens 

 have the lengthwise lines and cross-bars more distinct than those 

 from Para. 



PoBoiluriolitliys bimaculatus (Linnseus). 



Head 3 to 3^; depth 2\ to 2f ; scales 32 to 35 in 1. 1. to caudal base 

 and 2 or 3 more on latter; 7 scales above 1. 1., rarely 6; 7 scales below 

 1. 1., rarely 6; 12 to 15 predorsal scales; snout 3| to 4 in head; eye 

 2f to3; maxillary 2| to 2f; interorbital 2| to 3; length 45 to 58 mm. 

 Six examples. 



Among my earlier material belonging to this species, the specimens 

 from the Tocantins headwaters each have a cluster of dusky dots 

 at base of each lateral scale, no other dots on outer portions of 

 scales, where apparently none were ever present, and thus lengthwise 

 series of inconspicuous spots are evident. In these the predorsal 

 scales are interrupted on the anterior median line, though closel}^ and 

 irregularly approximated, several being saddled over the ridge 

 of the posterior half. In the larger of my examples of Astijanax 

 hartleUii the predorsal line is more or less interrupted, though in the 

 larger the squamation is mostly destroyed. The Paramaribo A. 

 orientalis is pale in color, and in agreement with the Ceara material, 

 though without pigmented dots on the sides at present, and the 

 fallen predorsal scales have left pockets showing they were probably 

 more or less completely placed as saddles. A. lacustris shows the 

 scales of the predorsal closely approximated, though or.ly those of 

 the posterior , half formed saddles. A. jacuhiensis shows the pre- 

 dorsal scales with a nearly complete naked strip in front and without 

 the dark pigment dots, or only very faint sparse ones, at the bases 

 of the scale exposures. The body is also much deeper. Prof. 

 Starks mentions that Lake Extremos, Lake Papary and Ceara Mirim 

 examples have fewer anal rays (25-27), while in the Para material 

 they were more numerous (31-32).-* Of the first he says: ''These are 

 perhaps referable to Astyanax bimaculatus novcB Eigenmann, though 

 the lateral band is not so definite as in the picture of the original 

 specimen." A. bimaculatus novce I have been unable to find noticed 

 elsewhere. Finally I have described A. rwpununi^ from British 

 Guiana, which in no way differs from Ceard material. It shows the 

 predorsal scales nearly completely forming saddles over the median

 bordered by a single nuchal scute, are P. wuchereri Giinther and 

 P. unce Steindachner. The former has two series of spots on each 

 dorsal membrane and the region between the ventrals is naked or 

 with but few granules. In the latter species the scutes on the belly 

 are reduced to a minimum. P. lexi R. Von Ihering, P. variipidus

A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE 

 ORTHOPTERA OF ARGENTINA. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



In these Proceedings there recently appeared a paper by the 

 present author entitled, "A Contribution to the Knowledge of the 

 Orthoptera of Argentina. "' This study was based wholly on material 

 collected by Mr. P. Jorgensen, of Buenos Aires, and submitted to us 

 for study by that gentleman and Mr. Esben Petersen, of Silkeborg, 

 Denmark. Since the appearance of the above-mentioned paper, 

 several additional collections from Argentina, made almost wholly 

 by Mr. Jorgensen, have been received from the same persons and, 

 in addition, a small but very interesting series from Mr. Carlos Lizer, 

 of Buenos Aires. 



The combined material represents quite a few localities supple- 

 mentary to those given in the previous paper, while thirty-eight 

 species are additional to the one hundred and sixty-two there 

 discussed. 



The total number of species here treated is one hundred and four- 

 teen, of which nineteen are now recorded from Argentina for the 

 first time, while three species are new to science. The number of 

 specimens in the present series is four hundred and fifty-eight. 



In the tabulation given on page 275 of our previous paper, there 

 can be added to the forty-nine species known in Argentina only from 

 the Misiones Territory, ten of the eighteen here first recorded from 

 Argentina. This is directly in line with the previously indicated 

 evidence of the richness and Brazilian affinity of the Misiones region. 



The forms here first recorded from Argentina are indicated by an 

 asterisk preceding the specific name. 



The types of the new species and an adequate representation of 

 the other forms in the collection have been retained for the Academy 

 series. We wish to thank Messrs. Jorgensen, Lizer and Petersen for 

 their interest and courtesy in submitting the present material to us 

 for study.

This individual is identical with, though very slightly smaller than, 

 the specimen from Puerto Bertoni, Paraguay, recorded by us as 

 Demogorgon batesi.^ Burr^ now considers the genera Labidura and 

 Demogorgon to be inseparable and synonymizes batesi of Kirby under 

 the older name xanthopus^ which action, as far as we can determine 

 from our material and the literature, is correct. Stal described the

 it from Salta, province of Salta, Argentina.

 and of the limbs is normal. The Alto Pencosa and Florincia speci-

The above males have been compared with Paraguayan specimens 

 of the same sex. The Buenos Aires individual has the interocular 

 portion of the occiput quite rufescent, a condition not found in any 

 of the other specimens examined. The female, which sex was 

 previously unknown, has abbreviate lateral non-attingent sublanceo- 

 late tegmina, much as in the North American /. johnsoni, from which 

 it can be readily separated by the slenderer build, relatively larger 

 and broader head, more transverse pronotum, more tapering tegmina 

 and shorter, more robust cerci. The measurements of the female 

 are as follows: length of body, 14.8 mm.; length of pronotum, 4.2; 

 greatest width of pronotum, 5.5; length of tegmen, 3.6.

Apparently closer to L. pusilla Saussure and Zehntner (Biol. 

 Cent.-Amer., Orth., I, p. 112) from Tarma, Peru, than to any other 



member of the genus, agreeing in having the 

 ulnar vein similarly ramose, toward the costal 

 margin, but differing in the pronotum being more 

 transverse elliptical with no truncation to the 

 caudal margin, In the more numerous costal veins 

 to the tegmina, in the subreniform shape of the 

 anal field of the same and in the non-annulate 

 antennae. 



Size small; form elongate elliptical; texture of 

 surface coriaceous, largely short pilose. Head 

 with entire width of vertex visible cephalad of pronotum, the outline 

 of occiput subtruncate; eyes large, interspace between them slightly 

 greater than the depth of a single eye; antennse moniliform. Pro- 

 notum transverse elliptical, the greatest length contained about one 

 and three-eighth times in the greatest width; cephalic margin 

 subtruncate, caudal margin gently arcuate, not at all truncate; a 

 distinct medio-longitudinal sulcus present on almost the entire disk, 

 the latter subimpressed and defined caudad by a subrectangulate 

 indentation, the surface of the disk with about four pairs of oblique, 

 very low strumose ridges; lateral portions of the pronotum sub- 

 deflected, the margins there distinctly cingulate. Tegmina elongate, 

 surpassing the apex of the abdomen by more than a third of their 

 length, their greatest width (at distal third) 

 contained nearly three times in their greatest 

 length; costal margin very gently arcuate, distal 

 margin rather narrowly rounded, sutural margin 

 nearly straight; costal veins about fifteen in 

 number, ulnar vein sending three rami toward 

 the costal and distal margins, anal field abbre- 

 viate, occupying less than a third of the tegminal 

 length, anal sulcus arcuate, oblique adventitious 

 vein and impressed sulcus decided. Wings reach- 

 ing to the tips of the tegmina. Subgenital plate 

 broad, ample, with short lateral styles; cerci 

 elongate, articulate.

These specimens fully agree with the individuals from the Misiones

 darker. The present record considerably extends the range of the 

 species, previously known only from Nova Friburgo, state of Rio 

 de Janeiro, Brazil, and the Misiones territory of Argentina.

This individual is the second male and third specimen known of 

 this remarkable genus and species. Originally described in 1897 

 from the female sex, taken at Caiza in the Bolivian Chaco, the next 

 record of its capture was made by Chopard,'' who first described the 

 male sex from a specimen taken at Santiago del Estero, Argentina, in 



7 Bull. Soc. Entom. France, 1911, pp. 141-143, figs. 1, 2.

 description and figure, except "that our specimen is of a brownish 

 instead of greenish phase of coloration. 



Subfamily M ANTING. 

 Brunneria brasiliensis Saussure. 



Misiones. February, 1911. (Jorgensen.) Three males. 



Mendoza, Prov. of Mendoza. (Haarup.) One male, one female. 



The Mendoza male is somewhat smaller than the Misiones individ- 

 ual of that sex, but otherwise inseparable. Two of the Misiones 

 males are of a brownish phase of coloration, while the other specimens 

 are greenish. Mendoza is the most southern locality from which the 

 species is known. 

 Coptopteryx argentina (Burmeister) 



Misiones. January, February, 1911; February 4, 1910, December, 

 1910. (Jorgensen.) Eleven males. 



Buenos Aires. (Lizer.) One female. 



These specimens vary considerably in size. The individual from 

 Buenos Aires is the smallest female of the species we have seen, its 

 measurements being: length of body, 52.5 mm.; length of pronotum, 

 17; greatest width of pronotum, 5.5; length of tegmen, 9; length 

 of cephalic femur, 14.1; length of caudal femur, 16.8. The form of 

 the pronotum in several is similar to or strongly approaches that of 

 the Cordillera de Mendoza individual previously mentioned by us.^ 

 In all of the present series the proximal portion of the marginal field 

 of the tegmina is opaque rufous. 



Coptopteryx gayi (Blanchard). 



Mendoza. (Haarup.) One male.

These apparently are the first exact records of this species, which 

 was described from the "Argentine Pampas" and since reported 

 from Brazil. The triangularly attenuate form of the cephalic 

 section of the pronotum of this species is distinctive.

The former is the most elevated locality from which the species 

 has been taken. The distal extremities of the median and caudal 

 femora and the adjacent portion of the tibiae in the Tapia female 

 are dark bro^^^lish, with which color the external face of the cephalic 

 coxae is also in large part blotched, the proximal portion of the 

 corresponding femora also suffused with the same. The external 

 face of the cephalic femora also has a median spot of brownish on

This specimen fully agrees with a male of the species from Corumbd, 

 Brazil. Bruner's M. brasiliensis^'^ appears to be very doubtfully 

 distinct, as the differential characters given are very slight, the 

 presumably different measurements being largely accounted for by 

 different general size, and in consequence they are hardly proportional.

We refer the present specimen to this poorly understood species 

 with a query. The fastigium is faintly tapering with the apex little 

 blunted, which feature is not in accord with the original description, 

 but this seems of minor importance, as there is some individual 

 variation in this respect in the group. The size is appreciably less 

 than that originally given for the sex (3f inches), but in this our 

 specimen is very close to the male from Brazil measured by Brunner 

 ^nd tentatively referred by him to calamus}^

[three pairs in copula]. 



From this material it is evident that the species is dimorphic in 

 wing length, all three pairs taken in copula differing individually 

 in this respect, two pairs having the males brachypterous and the 

 females macropterous and the other pair having the male macropter- 

 ous and the female brachypterous. Of the unmated specimens one 

 male and one female are macropterous and four females brachyp- 

 terous. In the brachypterous individuals the apices of the tegmina 

 vary from straight to strongly uncinate. From the present evidence 

 it would appear that germari Burmeister is merely the macropterous 

 phase of the present species, but we do not wish to establish this 

 synonymy until we are better acquainted with Brazilian material 

 of the genus. All of the present series are of a brownish coloration, 

 some more blackish brown than others.

La Cumbre, Prov. of Cordoba. (Lizer.) Two adult males, one

The Misiones specimens bear out the facts previously stated by 

 ygi2 regarding the divergence of material from this locality from 

 typical Buenos Aires individuals, the only difference from the points 

 there noted being the lack of dull purplish on the humeral regions of 

 two males and the but very faint indication of it in another. The 

 La Cumbre adults are similar in form and coloration to Buenos 

 Aires individuals, but the tegmina and wings are shorter. The 

 nymphs show that the reduction of the median carina in this genus 

 is a feature of specialization, as they have it strongly elevated and 

 considerably arcuate.

Though the color pattern is very obscure in these dark specimens 

 before us, it shows a distinct similarity to that of the usually pale 

 brasiliensis, in- which species the color pattern is, as a result of the 

 pale general coloration, usually decidedly recessive. In the present 

 species the general coloration is bister, with intermediate channel 

 of tegmina, under parts of body and limbs buffy, the latter flecked 

 with bister dorsad. The occiput is bister striped with three narrow 

 buffy longitudinal lines. The maxillary palpi are pale, clothed with 

 dark hairs and \^dth distal portion of terminal joint briefly infuscated. 

 The entire lower portion of the face and lateral lobes of the pronotum 

 are buffy. 



In addition to the type we have examined, a female bearing the 

 same data and one from the state of Misiones, Argentina, taken in 

 February, 1911, by P. Jorgensen. These specimens are all in the

We take pleasure in dedicating this species to our co-worker, 

 Mr. Morgan Hebard, whose masterly paper on the North American

 The abbreviate wings, supposed to be characteristic of fulvipennis, 

 we find to be individual in this as in numerous other species of the

THE GENUS GRYLLUS (ORTHOPTERA) AS FOUND IN AMERICA. 

 BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



To the systematic orthopterlst, the crickets of the genus Gryllus 

 have proven to be one of the greatest stumbHng-blocks in the order. 

 This is true of the forms found in both hemispheres, but this assertion 

 has especial emphasis when the American forms alone are considered. 

 This is not due to a lack of study, as Scudder and Blatchley have in 

 recent years both endeavored to diagnose certain or all of at least the 

 North American species, using what might be called "conventional" 

 morphological characters, while Lutz, approaching the subject from 

 a biometric point of view, concludes that species in an anyway 

 natural sense do not exist in the genus, in this skepticism representing 

 the other extreme from Scudder, who categorically defines a number 

 of species. 



The present authors have been unable in the past to approach the 

 subject with sufficient material to enable them to do more than 

 endeavor to assign certain of their series to various of the forms 

 recognized by Scudder. There has been constant and increasing 

 difficulty in doing this, as, while some individuals would fit certain 

 of the specific descriptions, others would be found agreeing in various 

 features with two or more of the specific diagnoses, the sum total 

 of almost any representation showing an endless complexity of the 

 characters used to differentiate the numerous described forms. 



The fact is quickly recognizable that almost all of the descriptions 

 of these species were chiefly concerned with size, coloration (not 

 color pattern), venation (in number of transverse (oblique of Saussure) 

 veins in the male tegmen and number of branches of the mediastine 

 vein in both sexes), tegminal length, degree of development of wings 

 and ovipositor length. Such factors have been found to be of minor 

 importance or of no specific value whatsoever in certain other related 

 genera, and the natural uncertainty of the status of the American 

 forms has led us to undertake a more searching study of these. This 

 work is based on all of the American material of the genus before us, 

 1,504 specimens. The results explain to our complete satisfaction 

 the reasons for the past confusion, a summarj^ of which is given 

 below. 




294 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The genus Gryllus is found in America everywhere from southern 

 Canada to Patagonia. Many forms are developed, distinctive in 

 appearance to different degrees, but possessing in not a single instance 

 valid and constant specific characters, with the exception of Gryllus 

 domesticus, a distinctive introduced species. 



The different manifestations of the only native American species, 

 Gryllus assimilis, are in no case sufficiently differentiated or constant 

 to be considered geographic races. They constitute mere variations, 

 the adaptation of this exceedingly plastic species to local environ- 

 mental conditions. All are in varying degrees unstable./ but certain 

 geographic limits naturally bound the distribution of each, thus 

 desert adaptations, such as those described as personatus and armatus, 

 are never found in the well watered portions of the continent, nor is 

 the tropical adaptation, assimilis, found in the extreme northern 

 or southern portions of the range of the species. This is of course 

 explained by the fact that the environmental conditions producing 

 these variants are not found over portions of the range of the species. 



The work of Lutz- has already demonstrated the error of using 

 length of tegmina, wings and ovipositor as characters of specific 

 importance in the genus Gryllus. The mass of evidence upon these 

 features in Lutz's paper is absolutely convincing; from studies of 

 other genera we have found such characters to be of minor importance 

 generally throughout the Orthoptera. Finding no other characters 

 which could Avarrant specific distinctions in the mass of American 

 material which he carefully bred and studied, Lutz has, however, 

 stated that all the forms of Gryllus are conspecific. His examination 

 of the series of females of the genus in the British Museum should 

 have shown him the error of this opinion, but he apparently con- 

 fined his studies to the variations in organs of flight and ovipositor,^ 



^ Of these, the personatus variant, showing the maximum condition of desert 

 adaptation, constitutes the nearest approach to a geographic racial development. 

 No intergradation is to be found with the more northern variants or with the 

 other desert adaptation, armatus, found also in the arid regions of the south- 

 western United "States, which latter appears to be derived from the northern 

 variants, various conditions of which are found in the higher mountains every- 

 where in the region under consideration. The personatus variant, however, 

 normally very pale in general coloration, is found to be occasionally much darker, 

 and from along the Mexican border such specimens are before us showing the 

 traiisition to, and the tjqaical condition of, the mexicanus variant. 



^ The Variation and Correlations of Certain Taxonomic Characters of Gryllus, 

 pp. 1 to 63 (1908.) 



^ In length of ovipositor, however variable, different extremes are found for 

 each distinct species. For many species these differences may be negligible, 

 but for some species the maximum and minimum are very different. Such features, 

 however, can only be accm'ately ascertained after specific units have been located 

 through the use of definite valid specific characters. Thus, in the study of females

of Gryllus in the British ^Museum, Lutz confined himself to biometric observa- 

 tions and failed to recognize the specific units involved. The extremes of ovi- 

 positor length for this series showed a minimum of 5 mm., which is decidedly 

 shorter than ever found in Gryllus assimilis (10.5 to 25.5 mm. in material studied 

 by him, unquestionably referable to assimilis, and in our present series 11.2 to 

 23.2 mm. In most series of the species we find the great majority of specimens 

 to show an ovipositor length measuring between 12.5 and 21.5 mm.). 



^ Lutz also briefly discusses the genus Atlanticus in his paper, where from a few 

 specimens it is assumed that similar variations in length of ovipositor and caudal 

 femora exist, such variations demonstrating, in his opinion, the invalidity of the 

 two species for which the names Atlanticus pachymerus and dorsnlis had been 

 used. This conclusion is without foundation, as he totally overlooked the fact 

 that independent of general bulk these two species are separable by excellent 

 morphological characters. Recent studies based upon examples of Atlanticus 

 show that at least nine distinct specific units exist, each showing some variation, 

 it is true, in the length of the ovipositor and to a lesser degree of the caudal femora, 

 but the forms have excellent genital and other morphological characters, each 

 species being far less plastic than Gryllus assimilis. This would be, in part, the 

 explanation of Lutz's position regarding the Old World forms of Gryllus. A 

 deeper study than biometric measurements of two dimensions in these forms 

 would have shown excellent morphological characters for a number of species.

Of the names which have been placed under this species by Saus- 

 sure, we find that verticalis of Serville^ unquestionably belongs under 

 Miogryllus and there preoccupies both laplake and saussurei. 



When compared with other distinct exotic species of the genus, 

 this insect is found to differ in the extremes of size, relative propor- 

 tions, color pattern (where this is' developed, this feature being in 

 the present species very frequently lost through intensive coloration 

 and rarely through recessive coloration) and form of the male titilla- 

 tores. 



In Gryllus domesticus, hordigalensis and initratus, the color pattern

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



is in each wholly different. Other species, such as Gryllus desertus, 

 chinensis, afer and serviUei, show less striking features, but exhibit 

 a complex of characters which prove them to be distinctive forms, 

 worthy of specific rank. It would be ill advised, however, to attempt 

 detailed diagnoses of the exotic species except in a monographic 

 study of the genus. 



Specific Description. — Size variable (length ranging from 14 to 

 28.8 mm.^); form robust (two general types are developed, one, 

 particularly found in typical assimilis, somewhat more robust and 

 compact than the other, which latter is the normal condition in the 

 great majority of variants developed in the temperate regions). Head 

 slightly broader than pronotum (except in a rare megacephalic 

 condition; in this there is no flattening of the face at the clypeal 

 suture as found in megacephalic males of Miogryllus, and to an even 

 greater degree comprehending the entire face in males of several 

 species of the genus Scapsipedus''). Pronotum with proportionate 

 length of disk somewhat variable, but with this dimension usuallj' 

 contained in the width about 1.4 times, caudal margin of disk straight 

 to distinctly bisinuate, lateral lobes with ventral margin straight and 

 horizontal, or occasionally weakly declivent cephalad, ventro- 

 cephalic and ventro-caudal angles rectangulate, the former rather 

 broadly rounded, the latter more decidedly so, the caudal portion of 

 the lateral lobes is somewhat pressed inward, particularly ventrad. 

 In length the tegmina vary from less than half to fully the ab- 

 dominal length, in some phases their apices are situated externo- 

 laterad, though normally mesad. The wangs are either developed as 

 complete organs of flight (though never to the extent found in the 



^ These extremes are nearly equalled in two male specimens before us, both 

 of the scudderianus variant and both from Miami, Florida: length of body, 

 14.5 and 28. .5; pronotum, 3.1 and 5.7; caudal femur, 9.1 and 16; tegmen, 9.3 

 and 17.9; wings, (concealed) and 27; caudal width of pronotum, 4.6 and 8.1 mm. 



^ It is with considerable surprise that we find material of Scapsipedus limbatus 

 Saussure (referable to the variety africanus, if valid), in material before us from 

 Cuba and Jamaica. The males are easily separable from those of Gryllus by the 

 very peculiar head, but the females are instead perfectly normal in this respect; 

 no dark form of Gryllus found in America, however, having the transverse yellow 

 markings between the eyes found in the species of Scapsipedus. In the present 

 insect the males have a sharply defined band of this color between the oceUi, 

 while the females have an additional band just below, between the ventral 

 margins of the eyes and an elongate triangular mesal spot of the same color 

 below, the apex of which touches this latter band. We mention this species here 

 as females collected at some future time in the West Indies, where the species 

 has almost certainly been accidentally introduced from Africa by man, might 

 easily be confused with Gryllus. The genus Scapsipedus is African and Oriental, 

 limbatus is described from Madagascar, the variety africanus by inference from 

 Africa.

species of Miogryllus) or are greatly reduced, though perfect and 

 concealed by the tegmina^ (when greatly reduced in Miogryllus, the 

 wings constitute small rounded flattened pads, not folded as in the 

 macropterous condition, and may be termed vestigial rather than 

 reduced). The transverse veins of the male tegmina are normally 3, 

 sometimes 4 (particularly in some South American series where this 

 number is the normal), rarely 5, and very rarely 2 or 6; the speculum 

 is broadly ovate, liut somewhat variable in outline, with normally a 

 curved vein dividing it into nearly equal sections. The number of 

 branches of the mediastine vein is variable in the present species and 

 useless as a specific character. The caudal tibise have the dorsal 

 margins armed normally with 6 or 7 heavy rigid spines (the number 

 of these spines is seldom 5, except in a very few series and very rarely 

 8 or more^), the distal spurs are 6 in number, the medio-external, 

 medio-internal and dorso-internal being decidedly the longest, of 

 which the medio-internal is normally slightly longer than the others, 

 equalling slightly more than k to f the length of the metatarsus. 

 The male titillatores are very different from those found in either 

 Gryllus domesticus or Gryllus mitratus, with which species we have 

 alone been able to make this comparison. This organ is found 

 within the subgenital plate of the males of this group and constitutes 

 the repository of a small globular seminal sac which rests upon the 

 subgenital plate, but is enveloped laterad and dorsad by the thin 

 but corneous organ, the parts of which afford the diagnostic features 

 described below. This corneous portion constitutes a thin complex 

 plate, semi-circular in transverse section and composed of a medio- 

 dorsal and two lateral parts. The first of these is produced mesad 

 in an upcurved, rather narrow, triangular plate, with margins weakly 

 convex and with length nearly U times the basal Avidth. The 

 lateral, nearly perpendicular, portions are fused with this portion 

 dorso-proximad and are produced in shorter, narrow, vertical and 

 blunt projections, inside of which from their proximal point of 

 juncture with the dorsal portion extends on each side a single finger- 

 like projection which is also corneous and is slightly curved tow^ard 

 the apices of the lateral projections which it almost reaches. (See 

 Plate IV, figs. 8 and 9.) 



The coloration and color pattern is discussed below^ under the 

 treatment of the varietal developments. 



^ This is carefully discussed and figured by Lutz, The Variation and Correla- 

 tion of Certain Taxonomic Characters of Gryllus, p. 8. (1908.) 



" In one specimen before us of the personatus variant, the dorsal margins of the 

 caudal tibise are irregularly armed with 10 and 12 spines.

Treatment of the Specific Variants.— \\\ order to place properly the 

 material of this species examined, we have found it quite impossible 

 to group the specimens under any number of varietal units, and in con- 

 sequence we have devised a system of symbols as given below, by 

 which the coloration, color pattern, tegminal and wing development 

 and size of each specimen recorded at the end of this treatment is 

 defined. We have found that in general certain types do predominate 

 over certain regions. These constitute the bases of many of the 

 supposed species, but in our opinion should be characterized by 

 symbols rather than varietal names, owing to their complexity and 

 the evident fact that none of these are distinct either specifically or 

 as geographic races, and really show only the various phases resultant 

 from varied environmental conditions. In other widely distributed 

 and plastic species we have found similar environmental adaptations,^" 

 but nowhere in the Orthoptera of America is this carried to the 

 multiplicity and extreme diversity of such variants as in the present 

 species. Should varietal names be used without qualification for 

 such units, even for convenience, the frequent and varied combina- 

 tions of features, already proven worthless for either specific or 

 geographic racial cUstinction, would preclude the possibility of proper 

 use of even such names of minor importance for many specimens in 

 every large series studied. 



Symbols used to designate the material of this species here recorded.

Much material is found not even to fit exactly any series of these 

 symbols. To overcome this difficulty a few qualifying remarks will 

 often be added or two instead of one of a set of symbols given. Thus 

 a specimen recorded as AB, or VX, or 12, shows it to illustrate a 

 condition intermediate between that signified by the two symbols 

 of a single set given. 



The most frequently encountered variants of Gryllus assimilis. 



We would again caution the student that these variants are in 

 no case fixed, all manner of intermingling is found in large series and 

 the use of names to designate such is not warranted, as such use 

 would on many occasions unquestionably result in conveying a 

 false impression to subsequent workers. 



C, greatly suffused Z, (normally a or b, u) 012. assimilis Fabricius. 



This variant is widely distributed throughout tropical humid 

 America at low elevations and throughout the West Indies. In the 

 United States it appears only along the coast of extreme southern 

 California. Though many series are quite uniform for this plastic 

 species, specimens before us from Duran, Ecuador, show to varying 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 301 



degrees the cephalic color pattern found in the species. Other 

 names: cubensis, aztecus, galapageius, harretti. 



D, suffused Z, (normally d to f, v) 3 (often weakly 0). mexicanus 

 Saussure.^^ 



This variant is widely distributed over Mexico and Lower Cali- 

 fornia, it is the development toward an arid adaptation of the assimilis 

 type and shows great variability. In the United States occasional 

 individuals show a tendency toward, and a few specimens are typical 

 of, this condition in our series taken along the Mexican border of Texas. 

 In this variant the pronotum has the dorsum frequently' narrowly 

 bordered laterad by pale yellowish. Other name: chichimecus. 



EZ, (normally d to g, u), 2 (often weakly 0). personatus Uhler.^- 



This variant, a desert adaptation, in which the extreme of recessive 

 coloration and most strongly defined color pattern is reached, is 

 known only from the United States from Kansas, Colorado and 

 central Texas westward. Of all the variants of the species this one 

 shows the most decided indications of a geographic race in process of 

 evolution. It is interesting to note that this variant averages decid- 

 edly heavier than the other desert adaptations of the species found 

 in the southwestern United States. Other name : Stal's much older 

 name, lineaticeps, appears to represent a transition between this and 

 the mexicanus variant. 



A, suffused Z, (normally d to g, u), 3. armatus Scudder. 



In the same regions of the southwestern United States in which the 

 personatus variant is found, the present variant also occurs, often very 

 conspicuous on account of its dark head and pronotum which contrast 

 strongly with the much paler remaining portions of the insect. 

 Great variability is shown in the series before us, many differences 

 being found in individuals of every large series, but none showing any 

 approach to the personatus variant. Immature individuals of this 

 variant might be mistaken for those of Miogryllus Uneatus; they have, 

 however, the abdomen broadly infuscated, giving them a barred 

 appearance, while the spines of the dorsal margins of the caudal 

 femora are rarely less than 6 in number, in M. Uneatus normally 5, 

 and the young of the same are more uniformly yellowish. Other 

 name: alogus. 



B, suffused Z, (normally d or e, w) 2 (usually weakly indicated 0). 

 scudderianus Saussure. 



This variant occurs in sandy areas in the eastern United States, 



11 See Plate IV, Fig. 4. 



12 See Plate IV, Figs. 2, .5, 6, 7. 




302 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



in the north not large or robust (scudderianus, 45), but in Florida 

 larger and more robust (firmus, 2 weal-dy 0). It is an adaptation 

 to arenaceous surroundings in these regions. Immature individuals 

 could easily be confused with those of Miogryllus verticalis,^^ but in 

 that species the young are more regularly marked with darker colors 

 and normally have 5 spines on each dorsal margin of the caudal 

 femora. Other names: ruhens, jirmus, arenaceus. 



AU, (normally ax) 4. negledus Sc udder. 



This is the darkest variant found in the present species, the maxi- 

 mum development of the condition found also in the two following 

 variants. It is found in the northeastern portion of the insect's 

 distribution, ranging southward in the high Appalachians to northern 

 Georgia and is known from the Piedmont Plateau only in Pennsyl- 

 vania. Much variability exists and every intergradation with the 

 next two variants is often to be found in the same series. 



AV, (normally a or b but ranging to f, x but often u), 3. pennsyl- 

 vanicus Burmeister. 



This is the dominant variant of the species in the well watered 

 regions of temperate North America and is found southward to the 

 Gulf coast of eastern Texas. Great variability is exhibited and 

 every intergradation with the variants termed negledus and luctuosus 

 is to be found. Other names: nigra, angustus. 



AW, (normally d but ranging from a to f, w but often u), 3. luc- 

 tuosus Serville." 



This variant shows an intensification of the features of the last. 

 It is found throughout the lowlands of the southeastern United States 

 and in the Middle West from Manitoba southward to the arid regiong. 

 It also exhibits great variability. The maximum of this condition 

 is found in material from the pine woods of the southeastern United 

 States. Other names: abbreviatus. 



AXW, (normally a, u but often w), 3. integer Scudder. 



This is an adaptation found in the mountains of the arid portions 

 of the southwestern United States and also in California. Extreme 

 variability is to be found. Other name: vocalis. 



Our series are not sufficiently numerous from temperate South 

 America to show as definitely the variants there developed; quite as 

 many probably exist as found in North America. Of these fulvi- 



" Under this name of Serville's will be found both laplatm Saussure and saussurei 

 Scudder. See Hebard, Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc, XXIII. . (1915.) 



" This is the variant which the authors have previously consistently recorded 

 as ruhens from the southeastern United States. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 303 



pennis appears to be an adaptation similar to the pennsylvanicus 

 variant, but heavier, though no more compact, with larger head; 

 under argeniinus appear to be described numerous adaptations, though 

 tyjjically suggesting the luduosus variant with tegmina f. Saussure's 

 argeniinus variety c is, however, an adaptation similar to the per- 

 sonatus variant, but with color pattern scarcely developed. 



We have not referred to Walker's names here, as the majority have 

 already been proven synonyms and the descriptions are worthless. 



We feel certain that the other described South American species 

 have no further significance than the North American variants 

 discussed above. We have noted that in the mountains, particularly 

 those of arid or semi-arid regions, a degree of plasticity is found 

 greater even than exhibited elsewhere by this most plastic species. 

 Several South American names are doubtless applicable to such 

 manifestations of the species. 



Females, as a rule, have the tegminal and femoral markings more 

 decided than in the male sex, thus frequently in the same series the 

 males will show VWa, while the females will average Wb. 



As in our other recent papers, the material collected by one or 

 both of the authors is understood to be in The Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia or Hebard Collection.

The present species is readily distinguished from all manifestations 

 of G. assimilis by its more slender form and distinctive color pattern. 

 The titillatores of the male are also distinctive and may be described 

 as follows: the corneous portion constitutes a thin plate, semi- 

 circular in transverse section, with distal margin weakly produced 

 meso-dorsad and broadly obtuse-angulate with weakly concave

sides; below the ventro-lateral margins of this portion on each side, 

 rests a somewhat more thickened, narrow, corneous plate which is 

 exteriorly nearly horizontal at the base, but produced and upcurved 

 with blunt apex reaching a little distad of the apex of the dorsal 

 portion, inside at the juncture with the dorsal portion this ventro- 

 lateral portion is strongly concave thus forming claw-like projections 

 which hold in the seminal sac without pressing upon it at any point. 

 (See Plate IV, figs. 11 and 12.) 



The species has been accidentally introduced by man from Europe 

 and is now widely distributed through temperate North America. 

 It has in the past been recorded from Montreal, Quebec; Connecti- 

 cut; New York, New York; New Brunswick, New Jersey; Ohio; 

 Lexington, Kentucky; West Terre Haute, Indianapolis and Putnam 

 County, Indiana; Moline and Urbana, Illinois; Minnesota, and 

 Omaha, Nebraska. 



The insect inhabits dwellings, greenhouses, etc., where it is some- 

 times found in large numbers. The species is decidedly more alert 

 and active than assimiUs, in its movements more nearly resembling 

 the extremely rapid Gryllodes sigillatus, which tropical species also 

 appears to prefer the proximity of man. 



The series recorded below are in general coloration yellowish brown, 

 the specimens from Chicago, Illinois, and Albany, Georgia, are 

 .slightly darker than normal with caudal femora weakly suffused.

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, VI: THE HACHETA GRANDE, 

 FLORIDA, AND PELONCILLO MOUNTAINS, NEW MEXICO. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



I. The Big Hachet Mountains. 



The Big Hachet (or Hacheta Grande) Mountains are a short 

 range in southern New Mexico in sight of the Mexican boundary. 



They may be reached from the station of Hachita, on the El Paso 

 and Southwestern R. R., where provisions can be obtained. Water 

 must be hauled in, unless the prospecting in progress at the time of 

 our visit resulted in a successful well. There are no trails in the 

 mountains. The extreme northern end of the range remains to be 

 worked conchologically, as we could not reach it from our camp. 

 A visit should be planned much earlier or later than ours (August), 

 in order to have the advantage of what rain there is and also to 

 avoid the excessive heat. 



The highest peak, Hacheta Grande, has an elevation of about 

 8,500 ft., and is considerably higher than any other in the group. 

 Several large canyons dissect the range, two of them forming broad 

 basins. 



There are no springs in the range, but sometimes after the infre- 

 quent rains a little water remains for a time in rocky basins in narrow 

 canyons. We found one such hole containing about half a barrel. 

 It was foul with drowned insects, yet most welcome, as our canteens 

 were dry, towards the end of a two-day trip to Big Hachet Mountain. 



The colonies of snails here as in other desert mountains are usually 

 of small area. As the mountains are uninhabited and too dry for 

 cattle ranges, there are few local place names and no roads or ranches 

 to aid in locating collecting points. In the absence of any topo- 

 graphic map, we reproduce a rough map made from our field notes, which 

 should enable anyone to exactly locate nearly every colony of snails 

 found. For convenient reference we have named several promi- 

 nent landmarks, such as Daniels Mountain, ^ the highest peak north- 

 ward as seen from Sheridan Canyon, and Teocalli Butte, west of our 

 camp, both being inhabited by special races of snails. 



1 Named for the writer's coropanion on this somewhat arduous trip. 




324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The Big Hach'ets are without timber. Only the higher peaks 

 are in the pinyon zone. There are some scrubby cedars and old 

 gnarled pinyon pines, nowhere numerous. On some of the higher 

 slopes of Hacheta Grande Mt. there is a growth of very small scrub 

 oak, sometimes so close as to impede travel, as it is mingled with a 

 liroad-leaved, black-spined agave. Elsewhere a small agave with 

 white filaments is very abundant. There is also an agave zone 

 surrounding the mountains, bounded outwardly by the zone of giant 

 yuccas, both usual on the slopes leading to the mountains in this 

 part of New Mexico. South of Daniels Peak the higher hills and 

 buttes usually have Fouquieria and its characteristic society. The 

 rock is hard limestone worn into holes and points, and containing 

 few ill-preserved fossils, among which a Zaphrentis-like coral, 

 crinoid stems and a spiral univalve are most abundant. Rattle- 

 snakes, large centipedes, tarantulas and small bro^vn scorpions are 

 reasonably abundant. Birds and mammals are scarce, and owing 

 to the absence of springs, the mountains are not available for cattle 

 range. During the time we were there (August 20 to 26, 1910) the 

 heat was intense from sunrise until after 9 P.M. Sky cloudless until 

 midday, when small clouds gather, possibly covering 10 p. c. of the 

 sky. There was very little wind. The annual rainfall is not 

 known, but must be less than 9 or 10 inches, recorded from the region 

 immediately northward. 



Previous to the visit of Mr. L. E. Daniels and the writer, in 

 August, 1910, the mollusks of these mountains had been collected 

 by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. A., while serving on the survey of the 

 Mexican boundary. 



Dr. Mearns started from Mesquite or Mosquito Springs, Chi- 

 huahua, 6 or 8 miles east of the mouth of Sheridan Canyon. Enter- 

 ing Thomson Canyon, he turned southward to get a practicalile grade 

 for mules up the steep ridge terminating in Daniels Peak. Passing 

 near or over the summit he camped at its north end. From here his 

 route lay along the ridge to the summit of Big Hachet Mt. ; thence 

 eastward to near our Station 9, south past our Station 8, and back to 

 camp, as plotted on the map, where his route is approximately indi- 

 cated by small crosses.^ On this trip collections were made between 

 camp and the first rise indicated on the map, on the out-journey to 

 the peak, and somewhere between our Stations 9 and 8 on the return. 



2 We would here acknowledge Dr. Mearns' kindness in plotting his route on 

 our map and giving the above details of his visit. From the data it is now 

 easy to determine the type localities of the specias he found.

Dr. Mearns returned to Mesquite Springs along the ridge running 

 from Daniels Mt. towards our camp in Sheridan Canyon, and along 

 the wash ruiming out of this canyon. 



Dr. Mearns found the following seven species, which were deter- 

 mined by Dr. Wm. H. Dall:^ 



Patula strigosa Gould, var. concentrata Dall. [Specimens reported 

 from summit of Hacheta GTa,nde = Or eohelix hachetana.] 



Epiphragfnophora hachitana Dall [ = Sonorella hachitana]. 



Polygyra mearnsii Dall [ = Ashmunella mearnsi]. 



Thysanophora liornii Gabb. 



Holospira crossei Dall. 



Holospira hilamellata Dall. 



Holospira mearnsi Dall. 



The relationships of the Big Hachet fauna are closest with the 

 Florida and Organ ranges. Near related species of Sonorella and 

 Ashmunella inhabit these three ranges, and Sonorellas very close to 

 hachitana have been found in the Carrazolillo and Peloncillo Moun- 

 tains. The Oreohelices stand nearest to Chiricahua species. The 

 Holospiras and Vallonia are special to the range, but the other small 

 shells are common to most mountains of southern Arizona. 



Holospira is the most generally distributed snail in these moun- 

 tains. Its abstemious nature is evidently satisfied with the scanty 

 moisture supplied by the rare rains and light snow, which is said to 

 whiten the mountains for brief periods in the winter. No doubt 

 a great many colonies and other local races of Holospira remain to 

 be found. 



Holospira lives only where there is limestone. We never found 

 but one colony on igneous rock, and this was on a dyke in a limestone 

 region. They are usually found on the hot slopes, east and south, 

 where other snails are totally absent or very rare. 



The subgenus Radiocentrum of Oreohelix is represented by two 

 new species, making five now known. The new forms agree in 

 genitalia and sculpture of the embryonic shell with those already 

 known. In the large number examined^ no embryos were found, 

 so that there can be very little doubt that the species of this group

 Nat. Mus., XIX, 1896. 



'' Besides dissecting several individuals each of four of the s^iecies, we have 

 pulled hundreds in cleaning the shells, without finding any embrj^os. Among 

 ordinary Oreohelices it is rather exceptional to find an individual not gravid.

are oviparous — a further character distinguishing them from Oreo- 

 helix, which is viviparous. It is also a more primitive feature.

As this species is type of the genus Sonorella,^ the investigation 

 of its soft anatomy had become a matter of importance, and to 

 obtain living material was one of the chief objects of our quest in 

 the Hachetas. 



We found it at Stations 7, 8, 10 and 11. All of these stations are 

 near or on Dr. Mearns's route to the summit of Hacheta Grande. 

 Station 7, on the western slope of a hill at the head of the northern 

 branch of Western Canyon, was the most prolific locality. Here 

 the Sonorellas may be found in some numbers under large stones 

 on the steep slope near the hill-top, where there is some shade from 

 the pinon pines. 



Twenty-one adult shells from this station measure as follows: 



Diam. in mm 21.5 22 22.5 23 23.5 24 



Number of shells 2 8 2 7 1 1 



The shells vary somewhat in the degree of deflection of the last 

 whorl, but very little in other respects. The last whorl descends 

 more than in most related species. The color is pale fawn, fading 

 to whitish in the middle of the base, and having a cinnamon-brown, 

 shading into chestnut-brown, band above the periphery; this band 

 is bordered with white on both sides. The aperture is rather small, 

 its greatest diameter (including peristome) being 50 to 54 per cent. 

 of the diameter of the shell. 



At Station 8 only dead shells were found, but these are more 

 variable in size, the extremes in a lot of 8 measuring: 



Alt. 13.5, diam. 25.5 mm.; aperture diam. 13.6 mm. 

 u ^^ u 21.3 " " " 10.8 " 



5 Epiphragmophora hachitana Dall was originally designated as the type of 

 Sonorella, but the soft anatomy of the genus was described from New Mexican 

 specimens of what was subsequent^ determined as a small form of S. ashumni 

 Bartsch, a species which at that time had not been discriminated from S. hachi- 

 tana. The dissection of topotj^^es of hachitana shows that the New Mexican 

 form is specifically distinct, though closely allied.

[May, 



At Station 5 two broken examples, 

 much weathered, were dug out of the 

 soil. Though practically adult, the 

 largest measures only 18.2 mm- diam- 

 eter, the shell being quite as solid as 

 in large individuals. It was probably 

 dwarfed by the arid conditions be- 

 fore it became extinct in this place. 



The genitalia are remarkable for 

 the small size of the male organs. 

 The penis is very slender, diameter 

 1 mm., tapering downward, and en- 

 circled at the base by a short sheath. 

 The penis-papilla is very slender, 

 gradually tapering, and annulate. The 

 retractor muscle is terminal, long and 

 slender. Epiphallus a little shortei' 

 than the penis. The vagina is slightly 

 longer than the penis. Other organs 

 as usual. Measurements of the organs 



of two individuals are given in the following table, with those of 



allied forms for comparison.

The well-arched jaw has 7 or 8 ribs. The radula has about 22, 16, 

 1, 16, 22 teeth, both cusps becoming split on the marginal teeth. 



In my former work on S. hachitana (1905) I referred shells from the 

 Organ and Florida Mountains and from central Arizona to S. hachi- 

 tana, which at that time was not known anatomicall3^ While it 

 must be admitted that the shells are very similar, I find differential 




1915. J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 329 



anatomical characters, which, though not great, seem to be constant 

 in a considerable number examined, and which favor the more 

 analytical treatment of the hachitana group effected by Dr. Bartsch, 

 ^a view I formerly opposed. After examining many fresh specimen? 

 from both ranges, I separate the Florida and Hacheta Sonorellas 

 subspecifically. 



Whether the typical form of S. hachitana occurs outside of the 

 Big Hachet range is doubtful. The Peloncillo range Sonorella 

 {S. h. peloncillensis) is not easily distinguishable by the shell alone, 

 but the proportions of the genitalia differ. 



On the Carrizolillo Mts., top of two peaks near the boundary 

 line, numerous "bones" were collected by Dr. Mearns (No. 126,596, 

 U. S. N. M.). They agree with S. hachitana in the rather wide 

 umbilicus, small aperture and deeply descending last whorl, but 

 differ by the average smaller size, from alt. 10.8, diam. 19.3 mm., to 

 alt. 12.4, cUam. 21.4 mm. It is apparently a small race of hachitana^ 

 The locality is about 30 miles east of Big Hachet Mountain. 



Specimens reported as S. hachitana from the Chiricahua Mountains 

 will doubtless turn out to be one of the species already described 

 from there. Several resemble hachitani more or less in the shell, 

 but all differ in genitalia. 



The specimen reported from the Santa Rita Mountains (No. 

 105,385, U. S. N. M.) is dead and broken. It is not hachitana, but 

 probably an undescribed species near S. clappi P. & F.

Up to this time A. mearnsii has been known from the original lot 



collected by Dr. Mearns about twenty years ago.*^ We found it 



^The figured type of A. mearnsii and nine specimens in various conditions 

 of perfection are Cat. No. 130,012, U. S. N. M., said to be from the Huachuca 

 Mts. In the adult shells of this lot the parietal wall of the aperture is built up 

 and disjoined from the preceding whorl. In another lot, No. 130,013, U. S. N. M., 

 three specimens, Hacheta Grande Mt., the parietal caUus is appressed. This 

 diiTerence in the parietal callus is exactly what we have noticed between the 

 specimens from our Station 5 (near Dr. ]Mearns's camp site) and those from 

 our Stations 10 and 11, near and at the top of Hacheta Grande Mt., a place 

 also visited by Dr. Mearns. We conclude, therefore, that there was a mistake 

 of "Huachuca" for "Hacheta" in the label of No. 130,012; and that A. mearnsii 

 does not really live in the Huachucas. This seems the more likely because in 

 several camping trips to the Huachucas this species was not found. 



A record of .4. mearnsi from the Organ Mountains, N. M., has been published, 

 on the authority of Professor Cockerell. We have not seen the specimen, but 

 suspect that they are A. kochi Clapp. 



We suggest that our Station .5 in the Hacheta Mountains be accepted as type 

 locality for .4. mearnsi.

in great profusion at Station 5 on the east side of Daniels Mountain, 

 near the summit, with Holospira bilamellata . Also at Stations 7, 10 

 and 11, the latter at the summit of Hacheta Grande. 



The specimens from Station 5 (not far from the site of Dr. Mearns's 

 camp) agree well with the original specimens, description and figure. 

 Usually the parietal callus is raised from the surface as a thin, straight 

 lamina, and in almost all of them the edge is more definite than in 

 shells from other stations. The axial end of the parietal lamella 

 is abruptly bent towards the columella and is more or less tubercular; 

 Rarely the tubercle is almost free from the lamella. The spire is 

 occasionally almost fiat. The color in shells taken alive is translucent 

 sayal brown. The diameter varies from 11.5 to 14.5 mm. 



In specimens from the summit of Hacheta Grande the parietal 

 lamellffi are a little shorter; the axial end of the longer branch is 



often straight, but more fre- 

 quently is bent, or the bend is 

 represented by a tubercle con- 

 nected with, or almost free from 

 the lamella. The edge of the 

 parietal callus is appressed to the 

 surface, and is often arcuate. 

 The aperture varies in obliquity, 

 as the figures show. 



The penis is stout, bipartite. 

 The epiphallus is strongly con- 

 voluted just beyond the insertion 

 of the retractor muscle. It is 

 very long. No flagellum seen. 

 The spermatheca is largest in the 

 middle, thin-walled. Length of 

 penis 4.5 mm.; epiphallus 30 

 mm. ; vagina 4 mm. ; spermatheca and duct 19 mm. 



A. mearnsi lives in the earth under stones, like A. ivalkeri in the 

 Floridas, both being burrowing species. It is closely related to 

 A. kochi Clapp and A. walkeri Ferriss, but quite distinct from both. 

 A. levettei bifurca in the Huachucas is a less depressed shell with 

 more whorls. 



Oreohelix (Radiocentrum) hachetana n. up. Plate VI, figis. 1 to Id, 6. 



The shell is depressed, umbilicate, the umbilicus about one-fourth 

 the diameter of the shell ; moderately solid, but thin, opaque whitish, 

 obliquely streaked or smeared with various shades from light cinna-

 the periphery; embryonic whorls fa^\m color. Spire convex or very 

 low conic, If embryonic whorls convex, sculptured with delicate, 

 retractive radial rib-strise, a few very fine spiral lines in the intervals 

 (fig. 6) ; following whorls irregularly marked with weak growth- 

 lines, less convex, a little flattened or impressed above the suture, 

 the last whorl convex, very indistinctly angular at the periphery, 

 slowly descencUng to the aperture, convex beneath. The aperture 

 is very oblique, about as high as wide. Peristome thin, the upper 

 and basal margins somewhat prolonged and a little straightened, 

 converging, joined by a thin, adnate parietal callus.

abundant at the summit near and north of the small stone "monu- 

 ment" or cairn which marks the summit, on and under stones. Also 

 on the precipitous western slope at Station 10. 



The species is very uniform in all its characters. The size varies 

 from 14 to 16 mm. diameter, and in some shells the last whorl descends 

 more than in others. Very few have the parietal callus thickened 

 and a little raised. It differs from all forms of 0. strigosa by its 

 convex, radially costellate embryonic whorls, but in many adult 

 shells this sculpture is effaced. 0. ferrissi is probably the most 

 nearly related species, though very different.

 the total diameter; slightly convex above, base strongly convex; 

 thin, light dull brown. The embryonic shell of 1| convex whorls 

 is finely lamellose striate radially (fig. 5d). Post-embryonic whorls 

 have the surface densely lamellose along growth-lines, the lamellae 

 rising in triangular cuticular processes where they cross the spiral 

 ridges of the shell. When denuded, the shell has a blunt, projecting 

 peripheral carina; the upper surface has a wide, somewhat angular 

 spiral ridge upon all the post-embryonic whorls, sometimes with one 

 or two minor ridges; the lower surface has three to five low spiral 

 ridges and some minute, weak spiral striae; the whole shell being 

 closely thread-striate along growth-lines. The last whorl usually 

 does not descend in front. Aperture oblique, irregularly rounded, 

 lip simple, the margins rather widely separated, parietal callus thin. 

 Shells denuded of the cuticular processes measure:

0. ferrissi has much the appearance of the Chiricahuan 0. barbata 

 Pils., but this resemblance is superficial. When denuded of the 

 cuticular fringes, the two are quite different, the Chiricahuan specie? 

 being much smoother, without the strong spiral ridges of 0. ferrissi. 

 Moreover, the sculpture of the embryonic shell is different. The 

 shape of penis and epiphallus in 0. ferrissi is like 0. chiricahuana 

 and 0. clappi, both organs being enlarged distally, while in 0. barbata 

 the lower half of the penis is enlarged, the distal portion slender. 



In well-developed shells the last whorl scarcely descends anteriorly, 

 the upper margin of the lip being inserted on the peripheral carina. 

 In some of the smaller adults, diam. 13 mm., the last whorl is bent 

 downwards; the upper and columellar margins of the lip converge 

 and are connected by a raised parietal lamina, the mouth having a 

 somewhat triangular contour. These are to be regarded as decadent 

 (gerontic) individuals. 



At Station 1, Teocalli Butte, the shells are all convex above, with 

 a noticeably smaller umbilicus. The largest measures, alt. 7.8, 

 cliam. 15 mm., with 5 whorls (PI. VI, fig. 46). This small colony is 

 probably extinct or nearly so, as no living shells were found. 



Our Station 3 is on ledges of high clifTs facing the mouth of Sheridan 

 Canyon, and especially on a bench about half-way up. Here Ferriss's 

 Oreohelix lives on an almost inaccessible cliff looking out over the 

 mesa into Mexico. There is little vegetation on the ledges. On 

 the talus slope below the cliff there is a growth of dwarf oak about 

 knee-high, charming big wild roses of a species which we saw nowhere 

 else, Cylindropuntia, Opuntia, hisnagsis, etc. On top, above the cliffs, 

 the Fouquieria, sotol, mescal society is found. The Oreohelix colony 

 is of small extent; the ledges where they were observed living are 

 probably not over a couple of square rods in area, with perhaps an 

 equal area on the talus below the cliffs, where dead shells were found. 

 These estimates are from memory, as I neglected to note the figures 

 at the time. 



The locality on the east side of Teocalli Butte is more restricted, 

 ;and if possible more arid.

Differs from 0. ferrissi by the more convex spire and by the weak- 

 ness of the spiral sculpture, there being no such pronounced spiral 

 ridge on the upper surface of the whorls, and only very weakly 

 sketched spirals on the base, whilst in 0. ferrissi these ridges are very 

 emphatic.

Only a few long-dead shells were taken, I^ut these surely indicate 

 a local race which has finally succumbed to the increasing aridity 

 of their station. Of large shells only Holospira and Ashmunella 

 survive on this mountain, both of them being burrowing animals.

UROCOPTIDuE. 



The study of a very large series of Hachita Holospiras has fully 

 confirmed the results reached in our study of Chiricahuan species, 

 that the number of internal lamellse is variable in each species and 

 colony, among perfectly mature or even aged individuals. They 

 vary in a way it was impossible to foresee at the time when Holo- 

 spiras were so rare that only one or two of a lot could be opened. 

 Very naturally, the number of internal lamellse was thought at that 

 time to be of specific and even subgeneric value. 



In some colonies it appears that the largest shells have in the 

 average the greatest development of lamellse, so that it might be 

 thought that only the most vigorous individuals attain the full 

 number; yet other races or colonies give a contrary result. No 

 external character is correllated with the number of lamellse. Usually 

 most of the shells of any one colony resemble each other in size, 

 shape and sculpture, so that each lot has a certain individuality, 

 though all of the characters vary more than is usual among the 

 land snails. We have never found two species of Holospira living 

 in one colony, either in the Hachitas or in any other district, in the 

 course of several years, collecting, in many places in Texas, New 

 Mexico and Arizona. 



A comparison of the Holospiras of the Hachita Grande range with 

 those of the Chiricahua range shows some interesting resemblances 

 and differences. In both localities the internal lamellse present (in 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



almost every form known l^y large lots) may be (1) Superior, axial 

 and basal, or (2) axial only. In Hachita forms we have also the 

 combination (3) axial and basal, which is never found in the Chirica- 

 huan series, where it is replaced by the combination (4) superior 

 and axial. Every Hachita species has, therefore, in different speci- 

 mens of the same colony, the characters of the supposed subgenera 

 or sections Bostrichocentrum, Haplostemma, Distomospira, and Tri- 

 stemma, while a Chiricahuan species will belong to Bostrichocentrum , 

 Eudistemma, and Tristemma. In external form and sculpture there 

 are no differences greater than specific between the Hachita and 

 Chiricahua species. 



The Hachita Holospiras belong, if we accept the criterion of 

 intergradation, to only one species, for which the prior name is 

 H. crossei. Between this species and H. bilamellata there is a perfect 

 series of intergrades in size, sculpture and number of whorls. We 

 mean by this that some individuals of an H. crossei colony could not 

 be distinguished from mearnsi; some mearnsi can be exactly matched 

 in a colony of hilamellaia, or of media; and certain slender shells of 

 bilamellata would pass as longa. The other named forms are more 

 distinct, probably because we did not happen to collect where th e 

 intergrading colonies live. The races are therefore based upon the 

 forms dominant in each colony. One might easily define a half 

 dozen species, if only a few shells from each place were in hand; 

 or if the internal lamellse were taken to be of specific weight, it 

 might be thought that there are between two and three times that 

 number. 



There are many colonies, most of which have some special char- 

 acters. A thorough exploration of the northern end of the range 

 will undoubtedly bring to light very many more forms, so that any 

 treatment of the group must now be tentative. For our present 

 purpose we consider the smallest form (crossei) and the largest (bi- 

 lamellata) as species, ranking the others as subspecies, though in some 

 cases they are more distinct than these two are from one another. 

 Several thousand shells were collected. 



The colonies at Stations 1, 2, 3, 12, are of very limited extent, 

 physical features restricting them. Station 5 is much larger. The 

 other Stations, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, merely represent collecting points 

 in large areas where Holospira may be picked up almost anywhere 

 over considerable tracts, while at the same time there are large 

 areas in the region over which these stations are scattered where 

 no shells can be found.

The first four references cited above pertain to specimens of tlie 

 original lot, of which there are 8 perfect shells in Coll. U. S. Nat. Mus. 

 and 2 in Coll. A. N. S. Phila. 



The species is distinguished from H. crossei chiefly by its greater 

 size. It was found by Mr. Daniels and the writer in great abundance 

 at Station 5, on the east side of Daniels Mountain under the cliffs 

 ■close to the summit, with Ashmunella niearnsi and Oreohelix, in the 

 piiion zone. In most of the shells the external ri!)s weaken or dis- 

 appear on the penultimate and one or two earlier whorls, but in 

 some they continue to the last, as in the type lot of bilamellata. 



Sixty examples from Station 5 opened, most of them measured 

 ^ive the following data: 



(1) One lamella, the axial. 13 specimens — 21f %. 



(2) Two lamellae, axial and basal. 41 specimens = 685%.

In size, sculpture and shape, we can find no external character 

 correllated with the differences in internal structure. The speci- 

 mens from Station 5 are from one colony. 



It will be seen that the typical bilamellata axial structure pre- 

 dominates, nearly 70% having that arrangement of lamellae. The 

 dimensions of this lot agree well with those given by Bartsch for 

 8 specimens in the U. S. Nat. IMus., but our lot, being larger, includes 

 shells both larger and smaller than any in the original lot. 



Holospira bilamellata longa n. form. Plate VII, figs. 2 to 26. 



Slender and pillar-like, the diameter contained four times or more

 mediate whorls usually smooth or nearly so. Aperture projecting 

 laterally and forward; usually 3 internal lamellae, in the beginning 

 of the penultimate whorl, therefore ventral in position, the superior 

 lamella generally very strong, and larger and longer than the basal.

Station 4, on the south slope of Daniels Mt. near the summit. 

 Types Nos. 112,269, A. N. S. P., collected by Pilsbry and Daniels, 

 August 22, 1910. 



Out of 20 shells opened, 16 have three lamellae and 4 have two, 

 the axial and basal. The pillar-like shape, numerous whorls, and 

 prevalence of a superior lamella, as well as the deeper position of the 

 lamellae, are individually variable characters, yet in the aggregate 

 they may suffice to define a race in this group. 



These Holospiras live among rocks where there is very little 

 xerophytic vegetation and the heat is terrific. The type lot was 

 picked up at about the same elevation as Station 5, but there the 

 exposure is less calorific, the sparse pinons and the cliffs afford 

 shade, so that the soil retains some moisture, 



Holospiras were seen scattered over a large area below and around 

 Station 4.

Twenty shells opened out of a series of over 250 show that the 

 bilamellate form predominates. The largest shell noticed is 14.9 

 mm. long, the smallest 14.5 mm. There is rather wide variation in 

 sculpture, but a large majority of the shells conform to fig. 3a in 

 this respect.

This form differs from crossei and mearnsi by the more slender 

 shape, long terminal cone, more numerous whorls and strong sculp- 

 ture. It agrees with bilamellata in having many whorls, but differs 

 by its slender form, longer cone, the prevalence of unilamellate 

 shells, etc. H. b. heliophila stands nearest to insolata, but in that 

 race the bilamellate form predominates. It is more conspicuously 

 ribbed than any of the other Hacheta races.

sharply costulate; buff -whitish except where darkened by the 

 presence of the soft parts, the last whorl shortly projecting; peris-

Also one shell which has two basal lamellae. The upper partition 

 was broken away in opening, so that the presence of a superior 

 lamella is uncertain. 



This form stands nearest to H. b. mearnsi, but the striation is 

 sharper, not partially effaced on the later whorls and the cone is in 

 the average longer. The habitats of mearnsi and media are rather 

 remote from one another, and several other forms inhabit territory 

 between them. 



The specimens from Station 12 are more like mearnsi, the sculpture 

 being weak on the penultimate and next earlier whorls. Out of 

 11 opened — 



2 have one lamella, axial. 



9 have two lamellse, axial and basal. 



1 has three lamellse, axial, basal and superior. 



Station 2 is on the northern slope of one of the ravines east of 

 and running from Teocalli Butte, at the foot of an irregular pro- 

 jecting bench of limestone. It is much the lowest station where 

 shells were found in the Hachetas. The shells are partly as rough 

 as those from Station 3, but some approach those of Station 12. 

 Out of 21 shells opened — 



15 have two lamellse, axial and basal. 



6 have three lamellse, axial, basal and superior. 



In size the shells from Stations 12 and 2 are about equal to those 

 from Station 3.

Six shells of the type lot, the measurements of which are given 

 by Dr. Bartsch, measure 14 to 15.8 mm. long, 4.2 to 4.5 wide, with 

 14 whorls. Twenty shells were taken at our Station 8, on the 

 eastern slope of Hacheta Grande Mt. (see map, p. 325). Ten were 

 opened, 3 having only the axial lamella, which is very weak in two 

 of them; 7 have axial and basal lamellse. Measurements follow.

These shells connect H. crossei and H. bilamellata. Specimens 

 of intermediate size agree exactly with one of the type lot of mearnsi, 

 kindly lent from the National Museum. The smallest shells are 

 indistinguishable from crossei, while the largest could not be separated 

 from small hilamellata. Yet the colony as a whole has a certain 

 individuality by its intermediate size, and as the form has been named, 

 we let it stand as a convenient place for crossei-hUameUata inter- 

 grades. It is attached to H. bilamellata rather than to H. crossei, 

 because the prevalent form, in the small lot opened, is bilamellate. 

 All of the shells were collected in one spot where the writer sat 

 resting. A large quantity could have been gathered had time and 

 strength permitted. A few specimens are quite finely striate, 

 while others are rather coarsely ribbed, like the type of mearnsi; 

 still others being intermediate in sculpture. The sculpture in 

 some shells becomes very much weaker on the penultimate and 

 next earlier whorls. 



H. mearnsi served as monotype of the subgenus Haplostemma 

 Dall, characterized by the possession of an axial lamella only. Bartsch, 

 opening another specimen, found a basal lamella also, and concluded 

 that that lamella had been broken away in opening the original 

 specimen. Since some fully adult examples are known to have an 

 axial lamella only, it is likely that Ball's original diagnosis was 

 correct for the specimen he opened, while Bartsch was also right 

 as to the shell he examined and which we have seen.

All of the above references were based upon 'the original lot, of 

 which there are 11 perfect specimens in Coll. U. S. Nat. Mus. and 2 

 in Coll. A. N. S. P. One of these two has a very weak, hardly notice- 

 able fold on the axis, the other has a very strong but short fold 

 there. 



The writer collected H. crossei at the type locality, the summit 

 of Hacheta Grande. The exact spot, Station 11, is just off the 

 western edge of the small level tract at the summit, which is marked 

 by a small stone monument. Being much higher, this station is 

 less dry than Station 5, where the large H. bilamellata abounds, and 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



there is decidedly more vegetation. A few were picked up on the 

 slope towards Station 10, dead shells being scattered all over the 

 upper 500 ft. or more of this ascent. 



Sixty specimens were opened, measurements of 31 being given below. 



(1) No axial lamella, merely a callous or very inconspicuous node 

 on the axis in the penultimate whorl. 15 individuals = 25%.

344 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The embryonic shell, of slightly over 2 whorls, is smooth and 

 projects nipple-like. The following whorls of the cone are strongly 

 ribbed, but the ribs weaken more or less on the cylindrical part, 

 so that on the penultimate whorl they are often inconspicuous or 

 almost wanting (for brevity called "smooth" in the above tables). 

 There is of course complete intergradation in this character, so that 

 the classification in the table is more or less arbitrary. The size 

 averages larger in shells with 2 or 3 lamellae, but there are exceptions. 

 It will be understood that the measurements were based upon shells 

 which to all external appearance are adult or old. After a careful 

 study of the aperture and lip, I think that it may be accepted as 

 certain that the variations in lamellae recorded above are not depend- 

 ent upon age of the individual. 



At Station 10, on the northern slope of Hacheta Grande Mt., 

 a small series was taken. All of them have the whorls of the cylindric 

 portion smooth or nearly so, glossy, the cone and the last whorl, 

 or its last half, being ribbed as usual. Ten specimens opened measure 

 as follows:

This lot, by the size of some individuals and the large number 

 (50%) of bilamellate example, is intermediate between crossei and 

 mearnsi, as it also is in the elevation of the station. It has a feature 

 of its own in the smooth median whorls, parallelled, however, by 

 some individuals of crossei from the mountain top. None of the 

 mearnsi seen are so smooth.

Summit of Big Hachet Mountain, Station 11. Type No. 112,012, 

 A. N. S. P., collected by Pilsbry, August 25, 1910. 



This species is abundant at Station 11, in the dirt under stones. 

 It is more closely related to V. perspectiva Sterki than to any other, 

 but it is a very much larger shell. V. cydopherella has far finer 

 striation. V. gracilicosta has closer riblets and a much smaller 

 umbilicus. V. alhula has a smaller umbilicus. 



Having collected and identified some thousands of the Vallonias 

 of Arizona and New Mexico in the last ten years, it was a surprise 

 to find a species which differs conspicuously from the three mountain 

 species mentioned above. As we have not found V. sonorana else- 

 where in our work in southern New Mexico and Arizona, it seems 

 likely that it is a southern species which Imrely crosses the inter- 

 national Ijoundary. As a rule, Vallonias are rather widely dis- 

 tributed snails. 



The Holarctic genus Vallonia now comprises about 25 recent and 

 pleistocene and a half dozen tertiary species, besides about a dozen 

 named varieties. It is likely that some of these are mere synonyms. 

 We have nine recent species in the United States, all of them readily 

 recognizable, except V. excentrica, which is often hard to tell from 

 pulchella.

II. The Florida Mountains. 



The Florida range (accent on the /) is about twelve miles long, 

 with a maximum elevation slightlj' exceeding 7,000 ft. It runs from 

 north to south. A partially detached but adjacent continuation 

 northward is knowai as the "Little Floridas. " As in neighboring 

 ranges, there is a long ascent or mesa before reaching the base of 

 the mountains proper (5,000 ft.), characterized by a zone of tree 

 yuccas. The mountains are arid and rather iDarren, of limestone in 

 the middle towards the top, granitic southward and porphyritic 

 northward. Vegetation scrubby. We noted as common two small 

 species of oak, hackberry, sotol, cylindropuntia, a broad-leaved 

 agave, etc. Barrel cactus (bisnaga) was seen at the foot. 



In November, 1906, Mr. Ferris and the author drove out from 

 Deming 18 miles to Mr. Priser's cabin, where there is a small spring, in

Spring Canyon.' This is above the middle of the west side of the 

 range. The summit here projects as a limestone butte, bomided by 

 cliffs on the east, north and west sides. Access was gained to the top 

 on the south side. The flat summit is covered with grass, Fouquieria, 

 Cylindropuntia and other cacti, Agave, etc. No shells. There is a 

 fine outlook, the jagged Organ Mountains silhouetted eastward. 

 Around the base of this central summit we found Ashmunella walkeri 

 and Sonorella by digging in the soil among the rocks, where there was 

 shade. We found only seven species of snails in all.

 opposite Arco del Diablo of the map. INIr. Ferriss had made a flving visit to the 

 range a year earlier, collecting ferns and a few snails on the 'slope facing the

The genitalia of S. h. flora (fig. 6, F, G) resemble the same organs 

 in S. hachitana, except that the penis is decidedly and constantly 

 longer, as are also the vagina and spermathecal duct. The penis- 

 papilla is indistinctly annulate and tapers slowly to the apex. The 

 penis-retractor is long and slender, attached to the apex of the penis, 

 and enveloping the base of the epiphallus. Measurements of the 

 organs have been given on page 328. 



The pallial organs are much as in Sonorella optata, but there is no 

 white thread defining the secondary ureter. 



The sole, in alcoholic examples, resembles that of Sonorella bicipitis. 

 It is ochraceous in the middle, pale gray at the sides. Back and 

 flanks dark slate-gray, the tail fleshy-gray above, having an indis- 

 tinct median line. 



Jaw and teeth were described in a former paper of this series. 



Ashmunella walkeri Ferriss. Plate V, figs. 2 to 2e. 



This species was originally described from a few dead shells. We 



found it living in abundance by digging 

 in the soil among the rocks where there 

 was shade. It lives in families or 

 "pockets." The snails are very hard 

 to pull, scarcely any coming out entire. 

 When they do, the shell is very light 

 colored, pale ochraceous salmon or pale 

 brown or entirely white. Old ones are 

 dull, but the best-preserved adults have

The genitalia (fig. 7) have no peculiar 

 features. The ducts are rather short. Length of penis 3 ram.; 

 epiphallus 14 mm.; vagina 2.5 mm.; spermatheca 10 mm. The 

 atrium is well developed and the flagellum distinct, though short 

 as usual in the genus.

•Oreohelix strigosa var. 



Two broken and very old "bones" were found near the central 

 peak above the spring, where we found Ashmunella and Sonorella. 

 The largest one, evidently adult, has the periphery- bluntly angular 

 in front, becoming rounded on the last half whorl. There are faint 

 traces of bands above and below it. Spire rather elevated. Height 

 10.6, diam. 17.5, umbilicus 4 mm. It differs from 0. s. depressa 

 by the angulation of the periphery. Possibly an exploration of the 

 southern end of the range, which from a distance looks rather good, 

 would reveal living Oreohelices, but we looked for them in vain in 

 the central and northern parts.

THEORIE DU GNEISS ET DES TEKRAINS CRISTALLOPHYLLIENS EN 



GENERAL. 



PAR STANISLAS MEUNIER. 



Les etudes que je poursuis depuis de nombreuses annees sur le 

 regime geologique des profondeurs de I'ecorce terrestre et qui m'ont 

 amene a une conception personnelle du mecanisme volcanique^ 

 m'ont mis progressivement dans la necessite de formuler quelques 

 conclusions sur les traits les plus generaux du metamorphisme 

 sedimentaire, ou normal, et sur le mode de formation des roches 

 cristallophylliennes. La distance qui separe le volcanisme du meta- 

 morphisme est d'ailleurs, selon moi, beaucoup moins considerable 

 qu'on ne Timagine quelquefois, au point que j'y vols avant tout 

 deux formes d'une meme disposition generale naturelle. 



Dans mon opinion, en effet, le volcanisme et le metamorphisme 

 sedimentaire resultent I'un et I'autre de la collaboration de deux 

 facteurs egalement indispensables : d'un cote le penetration sou- 

 terraine de I'eau et des matieres comparables, en circulation dans 

 des regions a temperature convenablement elevee; et d 'autre part, 

 la reduction des roches impregnees, en fragments de toutes grosseurs, 

 par le moyen de reactions mecaniques engendrees dans la substance 

 de la croute par la contraction spontanee du noyau fluide sous-jacent. 



Le developpement simultane de ces deux actions et la combinaison, 

 a chaque instant realisee, de leurs eflPets procure 1 'explication de tout 

 ce qui concerne la maniere d'etre, la composition et la variete des 

 roches metamorphiques, en meme temps qu'ils rendent compte de 

 tout ce qui a trait au phenomene eruptif. 



A cet egard, et pour preciser la discussion, il est indispensable 

 d'eliminer un point de vue qui a cependant, un temps, rallie tons 

 les suffrages et dont il sera facile de demontrer I'inexactitude. C'est 

 de faire des roches cristallophyliennes les produits d'une fusion 

 ignee, toute pareille a celle qu'on realise en chauffant des creusets 

 dans les fourneaux. 



Dans le nombre des travaux de ce genre, nous devons faire une 

 place aux recherches que ]\IM. Fouque et Michel Levy ont pour- 

 suivies de 1878 a 1891 et dont ils ont expose la signification dans 



1 La Nature du 24 mai 1902, p. 3S6, Paris. 




352 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juiie, 



leur ouvrage intitule Synthese des Mineraux et des Roches, p. 45 

 (Paris, 1882). "Nous avons entrepris," disent-ils, " une serie 

 d 'experiences dont le resultat est d'augmenter considerablement 

 le domaine de la fusion purement ignee. Les conclusions a tirer 

 de nos recherches peuvent en effet se resumer comme il suit: un 

 grand nombre de roches eruptives anciennes et modernes doivent 

 leur origine a Taction exclusive d'ane fusion, suivie d'un lent refroi- 

 dissement, les fumerolles et les agents volatils ne produisant que 

 la decomposition ulterieure des mineraux primitifs de ces roches, 

 leur action est purement secondaire." Conclusion formelle qui 

 repose sur ce raisonnement que, si une experience donne naissance 

 a un produit semblable a un mineral naturel, la methode mise en 

 CBUvre par 1 'experimentateur coincide necessairement avec le mode 

 operatoire de la nature. Or, c'est la une incontestable imprudence. 



Je sais bien que la fusion ignee a fourni maintes "syntheses" 

 de haute valeur pour la chimie et meme pour la mineralogie; je sais 

 bien que Mitscherlich a demontre I'identite, avec la fayalite ou 

 peridot ferrugineux, de certains cristaux contenus dans des laitiers 

 metallurgiques ; Ebelmen a imite, dans leurs composition et dans 

 leur forme, le rubis balai et les autres spinelles, en faisant evaporer 

 la solution de leur constituants dans I'acide borique, fondu au feu 

 des fours a porcelaine; que Hautefeuille a prepare des cristaux de 

 feldspath orthose de la meme fagon, en employant comme dissolvant 

 le molybdate de potasse liquefie par la chaleur rouge; que bien 

 d 'autres succes ont ete obtenus dans la meme voie par bien d 'autres 

 experimentateurs et pour bien d 'autres mineraux. Mais ces resultats 

 ne comportent aucune consequence dont puisse profiter la Geologie. 

 En conclure que les mineraux mentionnes sont des produits de 

 fusion seche naturelle c'est une erreur contre laquelle je n'ai 

 jamais cesse de protester, bien que la plupart des geologues aient 

 continue longtemps a croire a I'origine des roches cristallophjd- 

 liennes par la voie purement plutonique. 



Quelques-uns cependant y admettent un temperament^ par la 

 collaboration de "vapeurs montant de I'interieur, veritables 

 colonnes filtrantes apportant, avec divers gaz, des silicates et des 

 borates alcalins." L'auteur ne dit pas d'oii viennent ces col- 

 laborateurs si opportuns, ni comment ils se sont conserves en 

 profondeur jusqu'au moment d 'intervenir, ni par quel procede ils 

 peuvent traverser les roches fondues superposees et y remplacer

d'anciens elements par des "elements juveniles." Ajoutons qu'en 

 1899, MM. Fouque et Michel Levy^ sont revenus sans paraitre Ten 

 apercevoir eux memes sur leurs assertions precedentes, en relatant 

 des resultats procures par le recuit de verres de granit dans Veau 

 surechauffee. 



Sans contester la ressemblance des resultats artificiels avec des 

 mineraux natifs, il reste indispensable de constater que la structure 

 microscopique des roches cristallophylliennes est en realite, et quoi 

 qu'on ait souvent suppose, incompatible avec I'hypothese de la 

 fusion ignee. 



Nous Savons par les experiences de Senarmont^ et de ses succes- 

 seurs que, par I'effet combine de la chaleur et de la pression, I'eau 

 remanie la substance terreuse des sediments et la convertit en 

 mineraux cristallises semblables k ceux dont sont faits les terrains 

 cristallophylliens. Nous savons aussi que, pour obtenir ces resultats, 

 il suffit que 1 'eau surechauffee soit portee a une temperature incom- 

 parablement plus f aible que celle ou f ondraient les matieres modifiees : 

 c 'est a 300° seulement que Daubree, par la decomposition du verre 

 dans 1 'appareil de Senarmont, a fait cristalliser le pyroxene diopside, 

 comme Senarmont avait cleja fait cristalliser le quartz. Nous savons 

 enfin, par 1 'etude des blocs de calcaires stratifies, rejetes en melange 

 avec les produits volcaniques de la Somma, — apres leur sejour 

 ephemere en certains points du laboratoire souterrain, — que le regime 

 de celui-ci y a engendre des series de mineraux comparables a ceux 

 que I'eau surechauffee salt produire. 



Toutefois, il faut convenir que les resultats de Senarmont, con- 

 sideres en eux seuls, et quelque admirables, qu'ils doivent nous 

 apparaite, ne sont pas sufiisants pour rendre compte de la difference 

 ordinaire de composition entre les roches sedimentaires et les roches 

 cristallines. A la place d 'assises formees, chacune pour son compte, 

 de calcaire, ou de sable, ou d'argile, ou de gypse, ou de limonite, 

 ou de houille, etc., nous trouvons des masses dont chaque centimetre 

 cube est d'une complication mineralogique extreme, oii des mineraux 

 tres clivers sOnt associes intimement, temoignant avant tout d'un 

 regime ou devaient predominer les causes de melange, au lieu des 

 actions de triage, generatrices des depots stratifies. Pour concevoir 

 dans ceux-ci le point de depart de la derivation des roches cristallines, 

 il faut evidemment faire intervenir des actions mecaniques rapprochant 

 les uns des autres des materiaux tout d'abord tres distants et desor-

ganisant des accumulations homogenes, pour en eparpiller les debris 

 plus ou moins loin. 



II ne faut pas oublier a cette occasion que le melange en propor- 

 tions convenables des roches sedimentaires les plus communes, 

 fournit a I'analyse la meme composition chimique que les roches 

 cristallines. Et c 'est pourquoi nous assistons parfois et, par exemple, 

 dans 1 'epaisseur de houilleres, qui, comme a Commentry ont eprouve 

 suffisamment longtemps un embrasement accidentel, des produits 

 imitant, en tout ou en partie, pour leur composition mineralogique, 

 des roches eruptives de la categoric des laves.^ 



Or, c'est precisement cet ensemble de reactions qui parait avoir 

 laisse ses traces dans la substance des formations metamorphiques 

 et cristallophylliennes. Malgre la dimension gigantesque de ces 

 formations, c'est dans I'intimite de leur structure qu'on doit esperer 

 retrouver, comme a la piste, les conditions memes de leur elaboration. 



D'ailleurs, tout le monde est d 'accord a ce sujet, au point qu'a 

 premiere vue, la remarque semble bien inutile. EUe n'est 

 cependant pas aussi banale qu'elle peut le paraitre tout d'abord, 

 car il n'y a certainement pas de chapitre des sciences geologiques 

 qui ait ete aussi activement etudie que 1 'examen microscopique des 

 roches cristallines prealablement reduites en lames minces. Les 

 savants les plus distingues, voire les plus illustres, ont a I'envi col- 

 labore a ses progres et les resultats acquis sont de premiere valeur 

 pour I'analyse des roches et pour leur determination mineralogique. 

 Mais au point de vue geogenique, ils ont ete deformes par I'idee 

 precouQue de la fusion ignee. 



II peut sembler etrange qu'on vienne dire en face a la legion 

 innombrable des lithologistes : "Vous decrivez inlassablement les 

 roches les plus varices et cependant, tout en y recoltant des 

 moissons infiniment precieuses de faits capitaux, vous ne les avez 

 pas comprises. Vous avez meconnu le caractere essentiel de la 

 substance min^rale, qui est d'etre en proie, de la maniere la 

 plus continue, a des modifications de composition et de structure; 

 qui se defait et se refait sans cesse par des phenomenes si internes 

 qu'ils ne peuvent etre compares qu'a ceux d'ou resulte la biologic 

 des tissus des plantes et des animaux. ..." C'est pourtant ce que 

 je viens faire aujourd'hui, apres avoir hesite des annees. 



On reconnaitra, en effet, que les masses ramenees a la surface du 

 sol par les bossellements generaux, apres avoir subi le regime des 



^ Etudes sur Commentry, par Henri Fayol. Livre I" 4^ partie, p. 618. Roches

laboratoires souterrains, sont avant tout, et au pied de la lettre, 

 des produits de trituration, resultant des fins debris de materiaux tres 

 divers, malaxes et petris les uns avec les autres, puis cimentes entre 

 eux par une substance conjonctive de composition variable. 



Aussi a-t-on, certe, bien le droit de s'etonner qu'une pareille 

 structure, si bien reconnue et si bien decrite par tons les lithologistes 

 du monde entier, n'ait pas fait rejeter depuis longtemps une hypothese 

 tres anterieure a toute notion histologique des roches. Notons 

 Dependant en passant que des faits, bien anciennement apergus 

 proclamaient, j usque dans les laves volcaniques, et au moment 

 meme de leur extravasement sur le sol, un etat different de la fusion 

 proprement dite. On avait constate, dans le sein de la masse fluide, 

 des grains deja parfaitement solides, cristallins, ayant meme subi 

 des deteriorations, a "la suite de chocs et de froissements. C'est 

 pour consacrer cette circonstance si imprevue que Haiiy a applique 

 au plus visible des mineraux dont il s'agit, le nom caracteristique 

 de pyroxene: etranger au feu. 



Pour nous, ce nom exprimera le mode de formation du mineral 

 par voie mixte (eau surechauff ee) et nous le traduirons par : etranger 

 a la fusion du creuset (voie seche). C'est comme si Haiiy avait eu 

 1 'intuition de la verite qui eclate aujourd'hui, et le microscope nous 

 montre maintenant que les mineraux plus fins que les gros pyroxenes 

 n'ont pas, plus qu'eux, ete formes par fusion seche. Comme eux, 

 lis ont ete amenes en grains plus ou moins fragmentaires, anguleux 

 ou emousses, associes a des fluides, liquides, vapeurs et gaz com- 

 primes, qui impregnaient le magma general. 



Non seulement la structure des roches cristallines resulte du 

 melange cle mineraux dont le point de fusion, generalement tres 

 eleve, est tres variable de I'un a I'autre; non seulement elle admet en 

 contact les substances qui, comme le quartz et le peridot, auraient 

 par fusion reagi les unes sur les autres et donne du pyroxene par la 

 transformation du p^'oto en bisilicate de magnesie; mais encore elle 

 s'accommode, comme nous venons de le dire, de la reduction de 

 r immense majorite des mineraux constituants en fragments sou vent 

 anguleux, a cassures vives et non emoussees, si energiciuement 

 separes les uns des autres que I'on n'3^ voit que tres exceptionnelle- 

 ment des formes qui, a la rigueur, pourraient se raccorder. En 

 outre, de tons cotes, se presentent des plages, de quartz, par exemple, 

 dans la substance desquelles de tres petits debris de mineraux 

 concasses sont tres exactment empates, — a peu pres comme les 

 elements des breches des filons concretionnes. 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



La raison de cet etat de choses nous apparait comme tres compre- 

 hensible, par I'examen de phenomenes que nous ne pouvons con- 

 siderer comme transitoires, puisque leur serie compose precisement un 

 acheminement. vers lui. lis sont procures par des roches sedimen- 

 taires peu metamorphisees et dont les couches ont ete seulement 

 contournees, comme il en existe beaucoup dans les regions mar- 

 ginales des montagnes. 



Dans le canton de Vaud, par exemple, a Brent, aupres de Montreux, 

 j'ai recueilli des crochons de calcaire argileux du lias, oil Ton voit 

 nettement que la torsion des couches, du reste a tres petite 

 courbure, a ete realisee, malgre le manque absolu de plasticite du 

 calcaire.^ Le calcaire a ete broye par la deformation, mals les debris, 

 parfois tres petits, ont ete exactment maintenus en place par leur 

 emballage entre les couches voisines et la circulation des eaux 

 souterraines dans le reseau des fisssures produites, a comble ces 

 dernieres par la concretion lentement operee, de calcite et de quartz 

 cristallins. Le phenomene s'est sans doute reproduit une serie de 

 fois et c'est ainsi que la roche s'est progressivement repliee d'une 

 maniere tres serree, jouissant d'une fausse plasticite, de tout point 

 comparable a celle qui permet a la glace des glaciers de se mouler 

 sur la forme des vallees, dont ceux-ci occupent le thalweg. 



Le resultat, produit sur une echelle relativement faible dans la 

 roche argilo-calcaire de Montreux, s 'est developpe avec une intensite 

 incomparable dans le gneiss et dans les roches analogues, oil le 

 developpement de la schistosite, comme la production de plis et 

 de contournements inextricables, s'est accompagnee de la pul- 

 verisation et de la cimentation alternatives des fragments produits 

 et de plus en plus ecartes les uns des autres, par le mouvement 

 veritablement peristaltique qui accompagne la progression souter- 

 raine des lames de charriage. 



En general, les geologues qui ont etudie les lames de charriage 

 ne se sont guere preoccupes d'expliquer leur mise en mouvement, 

 de definir 1 'origine de la force qui les a deplacees, ni de preciser si 

 leur progression a eu lieu en profondeur ou a la surface du sol. M. 

 Termier, sans decider la question, laisse cependant soupQonner sa 

 preference pour cette derniere alternative:^ ''Pour mon compte," dit-il

La masse pesante qui aurait ainsi rampe sur le Brianconnais, faisant 

 Toffice d'un traineau ecraseur . . . etc." Je me borne a noter que 

 la coupe, que j 'ai inseree en 1902, dans le journal La Nature, con- 

 formement a 1 'indication donnee au debut du present travail, ne 

 laisse aucune incertitude quant a mon opinion personnelle. EUe 

 met sous les yeux du lecteur, le developpement d'un phenomene 

 souterrain, dont la cause dynamique est toute trouvee dans la con- 

 traction meme du noyau terrestre. Par cette coupe, on s'explique 

 comment la superposition de terrains anciens sur des terrains plus 

 recents, est le regime ordinaire, — parce qu'il est necessaire, — des 

 regions montagneuses; comment des paquets de roches supportes, 

 par une geoclase faiblement inclinee sur I'horizon et surmontee de 

 massifs enormes et puissamment pesants, out su gravir peu a pen la 

 rampe qui se presentait devant eux et, au moins en certains cas, 

 abandonner leurs "racines"; comment ils ont du infliger a leur sup- 

 port, et subir eux-memes, des plissements, des ruptures et des ecrase- 

 ments, melangeant des debris de leure parties separees. 



En general aussi, on raisonne comme si le phenom&ne mecanique 

 etait completement distinct du phenomene metamorphique et comme 

 si, par consequent, une masse gneissique charriee a un nombre quel- 

 conque de kilometres de son point de depart, pouvait etre restee 

 identique a ce qu'elle etait a ses debuts. M. Termier a ecrit.^ 

 "Les actions mecaniques deforment; elles ne transforment pas. Si 

 I'on veut, comme moi, reserver le nom de metamorphisme a une 

 cause capable de changer sur d 'enormes epaisseurs et d'immenses 

 etendues, un terrain quelconque en une veritable serie cristallophyl- 

 lienne, il n'y a pas de metamorphisme purement dynamique, il n'y 

 a pas de dynamo-metamorphisme. " Tout le monde salt l^ien que 

 les actions mecaniciues qui deforment, en meme temps echauffent 

 et, des lors, elles peuvent et doivent determiner des effets chimiques 

 au sein des masses ou elles s'exercent, de telle sorte que I'assertion 

 que nous venons de citer nous apparait comme la meconnaissance 

 absolue du phenomene naturel. C'est de la meme cause que resulte 

 I'erreur, encore professee generalement, quant aux conditions chi- 

 miques dans lesquelles ont ete elaborees, et s'elaborent encore, les 

 roches metamorphiques, aussi bien que les roches volcaniques. 



Rappelons que les unes et les autres constituent une longue serie 

 de types, reunissant les masses initiales de condensation gazeuse 

 aux depots sedimentaires meme les plus recents. Cette liaison qui,

enecartantlatentationcradmettre des interruptions dans revolution 

 planetaire, comporte la plus haute signification philosophique, 

 permet de suivre pas a pas les transformations d'une vase sablo- 

 argileuse en schiste ardoiser, en micaschiste et en gneiss: evolution 

 qui n'est qu'un detail du developpement normal de la terre. Ainsi 

 apparait la finalite du metamorphisme, qui permet revolution plane- 

 taire sans alteration des conditions de continuite a la surface, et par 

 une circulation verticale ou orogenique de la matiere des roches. 



La penetration de I'eau en profondeur resulte surtout de I'en- 

 sevelissement progressif de chaque sediment sous I'empilement des 

 depots qui lui succedent, 



Les materiaux de recouvrement exercent en effet, sur le sediment 

 choisi comme exemple, des effets complexes: par leur poids, ils lui 

 donnent, suivant les cas, plus ou moins de compacite et le privent 

 d'une fraction plus ou moins grande de son eau d 'imbibition initiale; 

 par leur faible conductibilite calorifique, ils lui conservent un echauffe- 

 ment c^ui va en augmentant au fur et a mesure des progres 'de 

 1 'enf ouissement. 



Mais il importe extremement de constater, et nous ne saurions 

 trop y insister, que le milieu rocheux sur lequel va s'exercer la 

 collaboration des solutions souterraines et de la chaleur, est soumis 

 a un regime essentiellement mecanique. Par suite des circonstances 

 deja indiquees, il eprouve des compressions inegales suivant les 

 point et diversement orientees. La pesanteur, qui determine la 

 compacite, purement sedimentaire, et qui agit de haut en bas, doit 

 se composer avec les poussees tangentielles derivant de la contrac- 

 tion du noyau et dont la direction pent etre consideree comme 

 horizontale. En outre, les reactions internes developpent, soit des 

 contractions, soit des dilatations, localisees les unes et les autres et 

 variables selon les moments. De telle sorte, qu'independamment des 

 deplacements en masses, dont la progression des lames de charriage 

 est la forme la plus visible, il faut considerer le deplacement relatif 

 des elements rocheux. II n'y a pas d 'autre raison a chercher de 

 1 'etat, avant tout craquele, des fissures microscopiques qui se croisent 

 en tons sens avec des largeurs et des longueurs diverses. On explique 

 de meme I'etat fragmentaire de tons les mineraux et la relation de 

 contacts, souvent imprevus, des eclats dans lesquels ils ont ete 

 reduits. En un mot, la pression mecanique vient s'associer, de la 

 fa^on la plus necessaire, a la pression physique des fluides d 'impre- 

 gnation soumis a la temperature des profondeurs, pour constituer le 

 milieu piezotherinique, ou s 'accomplissent tons les travaux du meta-

morphisme et oii a lieu, comme cas particulier, la genese des terrains 

 cristallophylliens. 



L 'ensemble des fissures microscopiques, qui constitue le fait le 

 plus frappant des roches qui nous oecupent, est comparable a un 

 reseau capillaire, dans lequel les fluides de profondeur, eau surechauffee 

 et autres, circulent avec une activite incessante et variable suivant 

 les points et les instants. Parmi les reactions qui s'y developpent 

 et qui font assister I'esprit a une sorte d' intussusception rappelant 

 celle des tissus organiques, on doit mentionner les precipites de 

 materiaux, en lacis conjonctifs, des debris derivant de 1 'ecrasement. 

 Et c'est pour cela que, dans les granits, par exemple, les gneiss, les 

 micaschistes, on voit de toutes parts de petits eclats de mica, inclus 

 dans des plages de quartz et d'autres substances, sans que la nettete 

 de leurs cassures ait ete en rien alteree par un emoussement ou par 

 un bourrelet, tels qu'en produirait la situation dans un bain de 

 cristal de roche en fusion. 



II va de soi qu'il faut compter, dans les causes de modification 

 de ces phenomenes, — outre la variation de composition des courants 

 mineralisateurs, provenant de localites changeantes, — les deplace- 

 ments verticaux determines par les bossellements generaux, c'est- 

 a-dire la progression souterraine des lames de charriage. Pendant 

 1 'ascension vers la surface, les conditions du milieu ambiant s'adoucis- 

 sent et les travaux mineralogiques internes se restreignent jusqu'a 

 s'arreter. Mais la subsidence compensatrice de segments voisins, 

 transporte dans ceux-ci les conditions memes que nous venons 

 d'indiquer. De sorte que nous ne pouvons douter de 1 'existence 

 au moment precis oii nous sommes, et dans des lieux convenablement 

 situes, de toutes le sconditions necessaires a 1 'elaboration des gneiss 

 et des roches connexes. 



On voit done que la ''cataclase" intense et ininterrompue des 

 masses cristallophylliennes presente une importance veritablement 

 dominatrice dans toute I'economie planetaire. Ceile-ci a, comme 

 moteur decisif, I'association des actions mecaniques aux influences 

 chimiques et thermiques qu'on a consideres jusqu'a ce moment 

 comme seules indispensables, niant completement la part du dyna- 

 misme. Repetons que c'est seulement a cause du broyage et du 

 rebroyage incessants des roches en voie d 'evolution, que des agents 

 chimiques, veritables fluides interstitiels des elements mineralogiques, 

 peuvent, par une circulation quasi-moleculaire, aller extraire peu a 

 peu des roches les principes caracteristiques des depots sedimentaires 

 comme le calcaire, pour y engendrer et y substituer, par une veritable

synthese, les mineraux cristallophylliens, comme les feldspaths et 

 les autres silico-aluminates alcalins et terreux. En 1893, M. Lepsius 

 pretendait,^ distinguer des Klastogneiss des gneiss ordinaires; cette 

 division est completement illusoire; on doit y renoncer: il n'existe 

 que des gneiss de dislocation. 



En definitive, on est en mesure maintenant de suivre toutes les 

 phases de revolution lithogenique, depuis le depot qui s'accunrmle 

 au fond d 'un bassin sedimentaire, a travers tous les types metamor- 

 phiques, j usque au gneiss et au granit. 



Le travail souterrain, contrepartie exacte des fonctions super- 

 ficielles, reconstitue ainsi la maniere de mineral d'ou celles-ci tirent 

 les substances simples des assises stratifiees. C'est la constatation 

 d'un cycle continu, deja soupgonne par Lyell, et les geologues qualifies 

 d'adualistss, et auquel le point de vue activiste^^ donne une allure et 

 une portee toutes nouvelles. 



II importe d'ajouter que la cataclase est un phenomene beaucoup 

 plus considerable encore que, les faits precedents malgre leur 

 ampleur, ne le feraient supposer. Je tiens, en terminant ce travail, 

 a preciser le role de ce phenomene dans I'histoire des roches extra- 

 terrestre, tenant a ne pas laisser passer cette occasion de souligner, 

 par un exemple specialement frappant, la portee philosophique et 

 la fecondite educatrice de la Geologic Comparee. 



La structure brechiforme d'un grand nombre de meteorites a 

 frappe tous les observateurs, ciui cependant n'en ont pas compris la 

 haute signification. MM. Fouque et Michel Levy ont pense en 

 devoiler la cause: "La frequence de ce phenomene (les breches 

 microscopiques) dans les meteorites pent etre, disent-ils,^^ rapportee, 

 soit a un mouvement explosif , qui les a lancees dans 1 'espace, soit a 

 I'enorme pression qu'elles subissent en traversant I'atmosphere 

 terrestre, soit meme a 1 'agglutination de parties individuellement 

 formees par Taction ignee. " Voila, on en conviendra, un bien grand 

 luxe d 'explications pour un seul phenomene. Chacune des trois 

 hypotheses peche cependant par la base et leur reunion temoigne 

 surtout chez leurs auteurs d'une ignorance absolue de 1 'economic 

 generale des meteorites, dont ils n'avaient sans doute etudie que 

 quelques specimens separes et pris au hasard. 



Pour ma part, et apres les notions que je viens de resumer, sur 

 I'histoire des terrains cristallophylliens, je n'hesite pas a declarer

que la constatation, si banale, cle la cataclase chez les meteorites 

 doit etre rangee parmi les faits les plus eloquents qui conduisent a 

 reconnaitre, dans les blocs de roches tombant du ciel, des debris 

 provenant d'un seul et meme organisme planetaire ayant evolue 

 exactement comme notre globe lui-meme. Seules, en efet, les reactions 

 actuellement en cours dans la masse terrestre sont capables d'expli- 

 quer les details de I'histologie meteoritique. La cataclase, etendue 

 a I'histoire des meteorites, est un argument nouveau et decisif pour 

 demontrer la realite des initiales relations stratigraphiques des 

 divers types de roches cosmiques. 



II y a meme plus encore; si I'observation de la croute terrestre 

 eclaire ainsi leur histoire, ces roches a leur tout permettent de 

 preciser, dans le mecanisme du broyage orogenique, des details 

 que les roches terrestres etudiees seules sont en general impuis- 

 santes a nous reveler. Ce sont certaines meteorites metalliques, 

 dont la malleabilite a permis 1 'inscription, dans leur substance, de 

 reactions mecaniques dont s'est accompagne leur broyage durant 

 les efforts tangentiels de la contraction, ou systole planetaire. 



Sans m'arreter au cas bien connu de veritables failles avec rejets, 

 comme en montrent les fers de Mukerop (Afrique Australe) et 

 d'Arispe (Sonora), j'ai en vue des masses, d'apparence continue a 

 I'ceil nu, et dont la structure est cependant comparable a celle de 

 nos roches cristallophylliennes. 



Telle est la syssidere de Kodaikanal (Indes Anglaises) dont le 

 temoignage est probant. L 'experience de Widmanstatten y fait 

 apparaitre une structure que M. le docteur Latteux a rendue plus 

 facile a interpreter par des photographies a 25 diametres. Elle 

 consiste dans un agregat, ou breche, -de grains metalliques empatant 

 des enclaves lithoides, dont nous ferons abstraction. Les grains 

 metalliques aj^partiennent a deux especes, lithologiques bien carac- 

 terises par la disposition relative des alliages, ou sideronickels, qui 

 y sont associes et qui manifestent de toutes parts des deformations 

 internes rappelant celles que le martelage ou le laminage infligent 

 aux fers meteoriques prealablement chauffes. Ces deformations 

 sont pour nous des stereogrammes des compressions et des etirements 

 eprouves, que fait ressortir leur liaison intime avec un reseau de 

 micro-fissures rappelant de tres pres celui des roches terrestres 

 decrit precedemment. Le plus souvent courbes et anastomosees 

 de la fagon la plus capricieuse, elles sont tantot fines et seulement 

 remplies de materiaux charbonneux, graphite ou cohenite, tantot 

 plus larges et occupees par des veines complexes et rubanees. Les

delineaments, rendus visibles sur les sections polies par Taction des 

 acides, nous font assister a toutes les etapes de la desorganisation 

 mecanique des "figures" et nous permettent d'imaginer dans les 

 grandes lignes I'allure du broyage orogenique. 



J 'arreterai ici, pour ne pas abuser de la bienveillance de 1 'illustre 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, la serie des faits qui 

 appuient la conclusion de mes etudes sur les actions mecaniques dont 

 I'epaisseur de la croute planetaire est le theatre d'une maniere inin- 

 terrompue. Comme on vient de le voir, les effets en sont prodigieuse- 

 ment differents par ieurs dimensions d'un point a un autre, depuis 

 le charriage en masse dont le massif du Mont-Blanc tout entier parait 

 ne representor qu'un residu fort climinue, jusqu'au craquellement 

 presque moleculaire, en tout cas microscopique, des elements min- 

 ■eralogiques des roches de tous ages et de toutes categories, qui 

 parviennent progressivement a la condition cristallophyllienne. 



L 'admission de I'activite mecanique parmi les facteurs essentiels 

 de la vie planetaire, est d'autant plus necessaire que la cause meme 

 de cette depende d'energie eclate a nos yeux avec plus d 'evidence. 

 Le refroidissement spontane du noyau terrestre ne pent pas se pour- 

 suivre sans determiner le retrait, a tendance centripete mais a mani- 

 festations tangentielles, qui refoule sans relache la croute a peine 

 formee. Les consequences de ce remaniement n'acquierent la 

 totalite de leur signification qu'au prix de la collaboration des pres- 

 sions engendrees par le rechauffement souterrain de regions rocheuses, 

 prealablement pourvues, comme on I'a dit, de materiaux elastiques 

 qui savent faire de celles-ci, par 1 'elevation de leur temperature, 

 des agents d 'actions mecaniques centrifuges. 



Ces travaux se realisent selon un mode operatoire harmoniquement 

 cordonne avec toutes les necessites de la vie planetaire, abstraction 

 faite, bien entendu des consequences individuelles qui en resultent 

 fatalement. Car nous devons chercher a nous degager du point 

 de vue personnel, pour admirer I'ordonnance majestueuse de ces 

 choses, dont seuls, parmi toutes les creatures, nous sommes admis a 

 contempler 1 'ensemble.

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, VII: THE DRAGOON, MULE, 

 SANTA RITA, BABOQUIVARI, AND TUCSON RANGES, ARIZONA. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND JAMES H. FERRISS. 



This paper and the preceding one (VI) contain the account of 

 mollusks collected in course of our explorations in 1910, from the 

 middle of August to the middle of October, The forms obtained 

 in the Santa Catalina IVIountains will be described in connection 

 with the collections made there by one of us (Ferriss) in 1913. We 

 were ably assisted in the field by Mr. L. E. Daniels.^ Besides the 

 ranges enumerated in the title, some account is given of several 

 minor hill groups, all in the region south of the Southern Pacific 

 Railroad. While this paper, with those already published on the 

 Chiricahua and Huachuca Ranges, is monographic for the mollusks 

 of Arizona south of the Southern Pacific, yet the field is far from 

 exhausted. Our work is a reconnaissance rather than a complete 

 malacological survey. Further species will reward search in the 

 southwestern end and outliers of the Chiricahuas, the southern 

 Dragoons, the Whetstone Range, and the mountains around and 

 south of Tombstone. Further west we have explored only small 

 middle sections of the Santa Rita and Baboquivari Ranges. Many 

 hill and mountain groups between Tucson and Nogales remain 

 untouched, most of them doubtless inhabited by endemic species 

 of Sonorella. In the nearly waterless region westward between 

 the Baboquivari Range and the Colorado River, almost nothing 

 has been done aside from some account of the snails of the Comobabi 

 Mountains, which we are now giving. 



Going westward in southern Arizona from the eastern limit of the 

 State, the general level falls and the mountains become lower and 

 smaller. There is a gradual elimination of snails requiring a reason- 

 able degree of humidity. AsJimunella and Oreohelix extend west to 

 the Htiachucas. Beyond that range they disappear. The small 

 shells also abruptly diminish in number of genera and species, by 



' We are indebted to Mr. J. C. Blumer, of Tucson, for several species from the 

 Comobabi and Cababi Mountains, which we did not visit.

elimination of the Transition Zone forms. Holospira, too, becomes 

 rare. In the Santa Cruz River Valley it is known by one species — 

 at the present time, one specimen; and none are known from further 

 west. The spread of this genus is not controlled by humidity. It 

 lives in the driest and hottest situations, often at low elevations, 

 but it is confined to limestone tracts, and limited by volcanic or 

 metamorphic rock. The mountains westward, in the region under 

 consideration, are mainly volcanic, and the stony tracts are therefore 

 unsuitable for Holospira. 



The progressive impoverishment of the fauna leaves, in the Santa 

 Cruz Valley and westward, a few Lower Sonoran Pupillidce, Zonitid{e, 

 Thysanophora (hornii), and the true desert snail, Sonorella. Sonorella 

 will live in the most arid places, where the rainfall does not exceed 

 5 or 6 inches, so long as there is abundant rock shelter and a certain 

 amount of shade, such as the shadow of a cliff or a small bush. 

 Northern slopes are preferred. In exploring a new mountain or hill 

 in the really arid country one aims for the northern or northwestern 

 slope under the highest crags. If coarse talus or rock "slides" are 

 found, persistent quarrying should produce Sonorella. In less arid 

 mountains, such as the Santa Ritas, the most productive collecting 

 stations are in the deep, verdant canyons. 



The exact location of collecting stations, and especially of type 

 localities, which we attempt in these papers, may seem meticulous 

 to many zoologists. In humid areas, or in dealing with less sedentary 

 animals, such exactness would hardly be worth while; if a type 

 locality is fixed within a few miles, it is near enough. But here we 

 deal with a region of intense local differentiation and with creatures 

 which are often confined within narrow bounds by physical conditions. 

 The hunt is difficult and laborious. The colonies are often so small, 

 the country so vast, that, without careful directions, one might make 

 a season's campaign in the more complex ranges without relocating 

 some former find which it might be important to investigate further. 

 It is, moreover, important to show exactly what ground has been 

 covered, in order that further exploration can be made to the best 

 advantage, that the unexplored parts of the ranges may be gone 

 over. In future it will be of interest to be able to trace the changes 

 and fate of the smaller and more isolated colonies, such as that of 

 Sonorella eremita, which covers an area of only a few square rods,, 

 many miles from any other snail colony. We suggest that future 

 collectors continue our serial station numbers in each range, instead 

 of beginning again at No. 1.

I. The Deagoon Mountains. 



This range stands 25 or 30 miles west of the Chiricahua Mountains 

 in Cochise County, Arizona. The well-known double-headed peak 

 of Dos Cabezas is seen northeastward and the Whetstone Mountains 

 westward, but the Dragoons are entirely isolated from other ranges. 

 The Pearce mining district lies on the east side. To its proximity 

 and the demand for mine timber the deforestation of the mountains 

 is due. All of the timber was cut about 25 years ago, but the 

 range, now forming the Dragoon Forest Reserve, shows good repro- 

 duction in places. At present the mountains are almost as bare 

 as the Dos Cabezas. 



The range is reached from Dragoon Summit, a station on the 

 Southern Pacific R. R. at the northwestern foot of the mountains. 

 North of the railroad the "Little Dragoons" form a low continuation 

 of the range. There is a depression at Middle Pass (Middlemarch 

 Canyon), where a road from Tombstone to Pearce crosses the range. 

 We did not explore the southern half of the range, below Middle- 

 march, nor the Little Dragoons north of the railroad. 



The mountains are formed of a complex of limestones and igneous 

 rock, the granites forming wild labyrinths of narrow gorges abounding 

 in cliffs and falls, separated by inaccessible crags and spires, which 

 gave a refuge to the Apaches thirty or forty years ago. The lime- 

 stones, forming a large part of the range, are accessible enough, 

 though rather abrupt, and as usual they proved much more prolific 

 of snails than the granitic and andesitic rocks. 



The range was visited by us (Ferriss, Daniels and Pilsbr}^) in 

 October, 1910. A week was spent in Tweed Canyon, where there is 

 a small stream. The map (p. 366) showing collecting stations from 

 Stations 7 and 8 northward was sketched from high points around 

 Tweed Canyon and its northern amphitheatre. After Pilsbry had 

 left, Ferriss and Daniels moved south to Middlemarch Canyon, 

 and the stations (28-36) south of Station 8 are located by notes 

 and a sketch made by them.- 



2 The map is intended solely to show the positions of our collecting stations, 

 many of which can probably be located exactly, and the others approximately, 

 by the landmarks given. The contour lines merely show local relative elevation, 

 not absolute altitude, and are not consistent on different parts of the map. 

 The summit midway between Stations .5 and 12 on the northern ridge of the 

 amphitheatre above Tweed Canyon is visible from the railroad at Dragoon 

 ■Summit.

The fauna of this small range is strongly individualized, since all 

 of the Holospiras and larger Helices are very distinct from species 

 of other ranges, even the Sonorellas having well-defined conchological 

 features. Like the Huachucas, there is (or was) an Oreohelix of the 

 strigosa group, but hairy forms and the Radiocentrum group are 

 wanting. The minute shells are all species common to the Chiri- 

 cahua, Huachuca and other larger ranges, but the Transition and 

 Canadian Zone species are very sparsely^ represented by Pyramidula 

 cronkhitei, Cochlicopa luhrica and Vertigo coloradensis arizonensis 

 only. Otherwise the fauna is purely Lower Sonoran. 



The collecting stations are as follows: 



Station 1. Slide of heavy, angular rock on west side of cataract 

 branch of Tweed Canyon, below the crags of this side. •

Sonorella ferrissi Pilsbry, n. sp. PI. \lll, figs. 3, 3a, 3b. 



The shell is strongly depressed, umbilicate (the width of umbilicus 

 contained six times in the diameter of the shell), rather sohd; of a 

 pale brown tint, between cinnamon and wood-brown, fading around 

 the umbilicus, having broad white bands above and below the 

 narrow chestnut-brown shoulder band and crossed by one or several 

 whitish streaks, reminiscent of former peristomes. The surface is 

 semimat. The initial one-fourth whorl is smooth; a brief stage of 

 coarse radial wrinkles ensues, followed by fine, short, interrupted 

 radial wrinkles, so short as to be papillae near the upper suture, and 

 sparse, short elevations, arranged in spiral, forwardly descending 

 series. On the second whorl these elevations become distinct, rather 

 regular papillae, which persist, in some examples, upon the third 

 whorl. The last whorl has fine striae and microscopic wrinkling. 

 The spire is but slightly convex. The whorls increase slowly, the 

 last descends a little in front and is rounded at the periphery and 

 base. The peristome expands very slightly in its lower half, and its 

 edge has a rusty tint. It is thickened within by a rather wide but 

 thin white callus, which shows as an opaque buff border behind the 

 lip. The columellar termination is slightly dilated, and the parietal 

 callus moderately thick in fully mature or old individuals.

Genitalia (Plate XI, figs. 3, 3a). — The penis is somewhat slender, 

 slightly shorter than the vagina, and a trifle longer than the epi- 

 phallus. It contains a cylindric papilla nearly as long as itself, trans- 

 versely wrinkled in the distal third and rounded at the end (fig. 3a). 

 The retractor muscle is inserted on the epiphallus near its base. 

 There is no flagellum. Length of penis 4 mm.; penis-papilla 3 + 

 mm.; penial retractor 6 mm.; epiphallus 3+ mm.; vagina 5i mm.

The shell in this extremely distinct species reminds one a little 

 of Trichodiscina. There is no other Sonorella like it. The embryonic 

 sculpture is a modification of the hachitana pattern. In the genitalia 

 it resembles S. bicipitis of the Dos Cabezas range as much as any- 

 thing. It is abundant in the northern part of the Dragoon Range, 

 but Tweed Canj^on apparently forms an impassable barrier to its 

 spread southward. 



We rarely found Sonorella ferrissi sealed to stones, forming small 

 rings. Most living ones were seen loose under stones or in the 

 earth, lying with the ap-erture up, like Eastern Helices, and sealed 

 with a somewhat convex white epiphragm. It belongs exclusively 

 to the limestone terrain.

The shell is rather depressed, umbilicate (the umbilicus contained 

 6^ times in diameter of the shell), thin, somewhat translucent, pale 

 buffy brown, with whitish bands on both sides of a chestnut-brown 

 band at the shoulder. The spire is low, conic, whorls 4f , moderately 

 convex. First one-third whorl smooth, followed by a brief stage 

 of coarse radial wrinkles, continuing longest near the lower suture, 

 and succeeded by papillae and short, vermiculate radial wrinkles, 

 interrupted by short wrinkles in a spiral direction, which on the 

 lower part of the whorl bear epidermal bristles, beginning on the 

 latter half of the first whorl, and continuing throughout the embrj^onic 

 and neanic stages as far as the end of the third whorl. It is suc- 

 ceeded by an excessively minute vermiculate sculpture, which 

 rapidly becomes fainter and disappears on the last two whorls, 

 which are glossy and nearly smooth except for faint growth lines. 

 Last whorl wide, descending in front. Aperture very oblique, 



round-oval. Peristome thin, very narrowly expanded throughout,

 of the penis and the base of the epiphallus. The walls of the penis 

 are thin. Papilla (fig. 4a) nearly as long as the penis, stout, cylin- 

 dric, having obliquely longitudinal corrugation near the end, the 

 apex being obtusely conic with terminal pore. The flagellum is

This species is related to Dos Cabezas species by the position of 

 the insertion of the penis-retractor, the cylindric penis-papilla and 

 the short vagina. It differs from all of these in its very large and 

 differently sculptured penis-papilla, and the thin shell, with rounded 

 aperture and minute granulation and hairs on the neanic whorls, 

 and a different pattern on the embryonic whorls. It is not closely

The shell is depressed, with low, conoidal spire, umbilicate (the 

 width of umbilicus contained nearly 9 times in the diameter of the 

 shell), extremely thin; mat isabella color above, paler below, glossy 

 and diaphanous in the central half of the base, encircled by a narrow 

 chestnut-brown band above the periphery. Whorls 4|, the embryonic 

 shell comprising 1|; sculptured like that of S. dragoonensis. The 

 neanic whorls are very minutely crinkled and closely set with short 

 bristles in irregular oblique lines. About 110 of these bristles stand 

 on one square millimeter, on the upper surface of the last whorl in 

 front of the aperture. The bristles are rather delicate on the last 

 whorl, and in cleaning the shell they are likely to be removed in 

 large part. The last whorl is wide and descends rather deeply in 

 front. The aperture is very oblique, subcircular. Peristome thin, 

 the upper and outer margins very narrowly expanding, basal margin 

 slightly recurved, colmnellar margin dilated, running forward. The 

 ends of the peristome converge strongly, and are connected by a 

 very thin, short, parietal film.

Genitalia (PI. XI, figs. 5 to 5c). — The penis is short and very thick, 

 cylindric, obtuse at the ends, much shorter than the vagina. It 

 has very thin walls, and is filled by a thick, fleshy papilla (fig. 5a). 

 This is thick-walled with a rather large cavity having plicate walls 

 so that it is star-shaped in section (fig. 56). At the upper end of 

 its cavity there is a short, conic nipple (fig. 5c) ; at the distal end of 

 the papilla the cavity opens by a transverse slit. The retractor 

 muscle of the penis is inserted on the epiphallus near the penis. 

 The epiphallus passes imperceptibly into the vas deferens. There 

 is no flagellum. The lower end of the vagina is swollen, having 

 thick, fleshy walls. The organs measure as follows: Penis 7, 

 penis-papilla 5, retractor muscle 8, vagina 11 mm.

 rugged south wall of Tweed Canyon, and at Station 10, on the 

 eastern ridge of the amphitheatre of upper Tweed Canyon.

This species is somewhat related to S. dragoonensis, but differs 

 by its smaller size, thinner shell, decidedly smaller umbilicus, and 

 by having the last whorl densely hairy, the hairs extremely short 

 and close. S. apache differs from S. dragoonensis rather conspicuously 

 in soft anatomy. The penis is shorter with a differently constructed 

 papilla; there is no flagellum; the vagina is much longer and is 

 strongly swollen at the base. The anatomical characters of both 

 have been examined in several specimens from different stations. 



The delicately hairy periostracum will serve to separate S. apache 

 from other species of the genus. It is an extremely distinct species. 



Its home is among the great crags around Cochise Stronghold, a 

 favorite resort of the Apaches. Station 10 is some miles northward 

 of the other stations and at a somewhat greater elevation. 



*S. apache was found only in igneous or metamorphic rock, never 

 in the limestone. It was not found sealed to the rock, nor were any 

 white circles seen on the rocks it inhabits, thus differing from nearly 

 all other Sonorellas collected by the authors. 



Other specimens, from Station 1, measure:

Station 1 is conspicuous from the hillside on the east side of the 

 mouth of Cataract Branch, as a long, bare streak in the dense brush 

 which clothes the slope below the crag at the west side, some distance 

 up the ravine, and rather high on the side. One living shell and 

 numerous "bones" were found by quarrying in the heavy rock of the 

 slide. More living shells were taken at Station 9, the type colony. 



The largest shell seen is a dead individual from Station 27, measur- 

 ing 18.5 mm. in diameter. 

 Oreohelix strigosa var. 



A young dead specimen was found at Station 2, under a stone, and 

 two fragments of the last whorl at Station 13; both in the limestone 

 region, but at very different elevations. Station 2 being only a hundred 

 feet or so above the bed of Tweed Canyon, 13 on the highest peak 

 of its rim. The largest fragment, half of the last whorl of an adult 

 shell, has a diameter of 18.5 mm. It shows a slight peripheral angle, 

 otherwise resembling 0. s. depressa Ckll. 



This Dragoon species seems from the fragments to be a more 

 depressed shell than the extinct Oreohelix of the Florida Mountains, 

 but it may be the same as the Huachucan race. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 373 



As we searched the range carefully for OreoheUx after finding one 

 on the first day, it is probably extinct, not surviving the destruction 

 of the woods. There remains a possibility that it may survive in 

 some part of the mountains not covered by our collecting stations. 

 Thysanophora hornii (Gabb).

UROCOPTID^. 



Holospira is rarely if ever found on igneous or metamorphic rock; 

 and as the Dragoons are traversed by many dykes, the limestone 

 areas where Holospiras live are divided by tracts barren of these 

 snails. This has resulted in the differentiation of several species 

 which though variable do not intergrade, so far as we know. In the 

 Hacheta Range the limestone is continuous, and while there has 

 been a good deal of differentiation, the several extreme forms are 

 connected by those intermediate in structure and location. 



It must be admitted that our knowledge of the Dragoon Holospiras 

 is fragmentary. The whole foothill region, where they abound, 

 needs attention. They are easily found, and in large numbers. 



Holospira danielsi n. sp. PI. XIV, figs. 1 to 3a. 



The shell is cylindric, the upper fourth (or third) tapering to the 

 slightly mamillar, obtuse summit. Tilleul-buff, becoming darker 

 towards the summit. Nearly 2| embryonic whorls are smooth; 

 then slightly retractive axial ribs appear, rather low and' delicate 

 on the first neanic whorl, after which they become strong, widely 

 separated, oblique (retractive) on the conical portion, still more 

 widely spaced and vertical on the cylindric portion of the shell, 

 where the summits of the ribs are more or less irregular from breakage 

 due to being in part hollow there. On the penultimate whorl there 

 are 13 ribs (more or less). On the last half of the last whorl the 

 ribs become closer (or many may be interposed). The whorls are 

 rather strongly convex, the last one tapering downwards, being 

 compressed below the periphery; base rimate but not perforated. 

 The last fourth of the last whorl is somewhat straightened but not 

 built forward beyond the level of the ventral face of the shell. Aper- 

 ture rounded-ovate. Peristome narrowly expanded except at the 

 upper outer angle, where it is simple and obtuse. The axis is rather 

 slender, subequal except at the ends. In the la.st part of the penult 

 and first part of the last whorl there is a strong, short, obtuse colu- 

 mellar lamella close to the base; a parietal lamella, much longer 

 and usually strong (and freciuently a smaller basal lamella).

They live on the most exposed, hottest slopes, often in great 

 profusion, but are not found on the mesa, where H. campestris 

 occurs. 



This beautiful snail is very distinct from all of our species by its 

 strong, rude, widely spaced ribs. One of the northwest Mexican 

 Holospiras, H. minima, has the same type of sculpture, though less 

 coarse than in the typical H. danielsi, which is the most strongly 

 costate species known. 



Like other Arizonian Holospiras, the internal lamellae are variable, 

 two or three (parietal and axial, or parietal, axial and basal) being 

 developed. Otherwise the chief variation is in the number of ribs, 

 and also in size. 



Twenty specimens of the type lot, opened, taken at random, 

 measure as follows: 



Length 12, diam. 3.6 mm.; whorls 13; lamellae 2. 



The smallest shell noticed in the type lot measures 8.2 x 3.2 mm., 

 with 10 whorls. The trilamellate shells are shghtly outnumbered 

 by those with two lamellae, forming 45 per cent, in the lot measured; 

 but this may be accidental. Three lamellae predominate in the 

 larger shells, two in the smaller. 




1915.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



375 



The sculpture is less variable in this lot than in some others. 

 Ten specimens, taken at random, have 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 15, 17, 

 17, 17 ribs on the penultimate whorl. These fairly represent the 

 lot, so far as can be told without extensive counting. None counted 

 have more than 17 ribs (see PI. XIV, figs. 1, la, 16). 



Station 3 (summit of ridge above Station 2), but west of where 

 the trail crosses ridge). Shells exactly like those of Station 2, but 

 perhaps a little more variable in size, length 9 to 12^ mm. in extreme 

 specimens. 



Station 4 (summit of ridge further northwest, several hundred 

 feet higher than Station 3). These shells are conspicuously larger 

 than at Stations 2 and 3. Part of the shells are typical in sculpture, 

 but in most of them the ribs are much more numerous, closer, smooth, 

 and more regularly spaced. These close-ribbed shells agree with 

 those from Station 5 and from Station 12, a peak on the opposite 

 (east) side of the rim of the amphitheatre of Tweed Canyon. Proba- 

 bly the close-ribbed type of shell extends around the whole rim 

 from Station 4 to Station 12. 



Two out of fifteen opened have 3 lamellae (both having many ribs), 

 and three have only the columellar lamella (ribs few). The rest, 

 including both many- and few-ribbed shells, have 2 lamellae. This 

 lot was picked up in several places along the summit of the narrow 

 ridge, perhaps in an area of 20 x 100 yards. It therefore may com- 

 prise several colonies, and we cannot now tell whether fine- and 

 coarse-ribbed shells occur actually together or not. There may be 

 12-15 ribbed colonies and 20-30 ribbed colonies, or possibly both 

 sorts may live together. The measurements give extremes of size 

 and are from "selected" shells.

Station 18 (PI. XIV, figs. 3, 3a). In the third ravine west of the 

 granitic spur on north side of Tweed Canyon, above a dyke of igneous 

 rock about 50 yards wide. Below this dyke, at Station 17, Holospira 

 campestris cochisei is found. A deep gulley or ''wash" extends 

 from the ravine upon the mesa. The shells at Station 18 are a 

 little more finely ribbed than typical H. danielsi and to that extent 

 approach H. campestris cochisei. Out of 16 opened, 9 shells have 

 3, and 7 shells have two internal lamellae. Measurements follow.

Specimens from the southeastern part of the upper amphitheatre 

 of Tweed Canyon have only one or two lamellce (parietal and axial), 

 those with one slightly predominating. The parietal lamella is 

 moderate or small when developed. They are also perceptibly 

 stouter in figure than the types, and the number of ribs is, in the 

 main, greater. 



Station 10 (floor of the upper amphitheatre of Tweed Canyon, 

 southeastern branch). Not a favorable station for Holospira, being 

 shaded by a dense growth of shrubs and trees. A few specimens 

 taken have one or two lamellae, and the aperture is built forward 

 further than in the types. Ribs as in the following.

 than usual in the type lot. 10.5 x 3.7 mm. axial or axial and superior 

 lamellae. 



Another lot, taken a couple of hundred feet higher, are similar 

 in form, sculpture and lamellae; ribs 15 to 19.

 two lamellae, the superior lamella not very strong. These shells 

 are like those from Station 4 and 5. See PI. XIV, figs. 4 to 46.

These shells have more ribs than any other colony of H. danielsi, 

 and they may be referable to H. campestris cochisei. The shells are, 

 however, larger than the latter, some of the ribs are broken down, 

 as in danielsi, and the locality is distant from other known colonies 

 of H. c. cochisei. Only a very small lot was taken, and, pending 

 further collections, its identity may be left undecided.

 striae of the conical portion narrower, hence appearing more widely 

 spaced than those of the cylindric portion, on which they are as 

 wide as the intervals. On the penultimate whorl there are about 

 70 striae. The last whorl is decidedly compressed below the pe- 

 riphery, tapering downwards, somewhat more coarsely sculptured 

 on the latter part. It is shortly rimate and built forward shortly 

 from the preceding whorl. All of the whorls are very strongly 

 convex. The aperture is angular at the upper outer part, elsewhere 

 rounded. Peristome narrowly expanded. Axis cylindric, in the 

 latter part of the penultimate and first part of the last bearing a 

 stout axial lamella. There is also a long and strong parietal or 

 superior lamella, and sometimes a basal lamella. Length 11.5,

The type locality, Station 16 (PI. XIV, figs. 7-7/), is on the sloping 

 sides of the arroyo, which is about 15 feet deep, and meanders across 

 the mesa. Near the mountain the gully deepens to 30-40 feet, the 

 sides become subvertical, and Holospira disappears. The mesa is 

 grassy with some bunches of bear grass. There are some small oaks, 

 juniper, catclaw, etc., in the arroyo. The shells are found under 

 dead sotol and sometimes stones, etc. They reappear just below 

 the igneous dyke near the base of the mountain. Station 17, but do 

 not cross the dyke. Several other arroyos in the same plain were 

 not examined, and there are doubtless many Holospira colonies in 

 the neighborhood.

Station 21, hillside, eastern slope of second ravine from granitic 

 spur, up to about 600 feet above bed of ravine. The shells are 

 variable, as would be expected in a lot gathered over a considerable 

 area, having 35 to 50 ribs on the penultimate whorl. Out of 1 1 opened, 

 one has 3 lamellse, ten have two, superior and axial. (PI. XIV, fig. 6.)

 28 ribs. (PL XIV, figs. 8 to 86.) This station is in a gulch on the 

 south side of Tweed Canyon, the nearest approach to the area of 

 H. miUestriata. It shows no approach to that species in sculpture, 

 which is coarser than in most cochisei. Some of the ribs were hollow 

 and are broken down, as in H. danielsi. This condition is also seen 

 to a less degree in some specimens of cochisei from the type locality.

whorls of the cone somewhat more sharply striate than the cylindric 

 portion, upon which the striae are very fine and close; typically about 

 90 fine, close striae on the penultimate whorl. The latter part of 

 the last whorl is slightly compressed and hais slightly coarser, sharper 

 striae. The aperture is carried very shortly free, is not calloused 

 within, and has a narrowly reflexed lip. Within the latter part of 

 the penultimate and first part of the last whorl there is a rather 

 stout, obtuse lamella on the axis. No lamellae on the upper or basal 

 walls of the cavity.

 Pilsbry and Daniels, October, 1910. Also taken at Station 7, and 

 Stations 29 to 37 southward from Stations 7 and 8. 



H. millestriata is related to H. campestris, from which it differs by 

 having more numerous, finer striae, and by the absence of internal 

 lamellae on the parietal and basal walls of the cavity, in a long series 

 of shells opened. Its range is separated from that of H. campestris 

 by the ridge of eruptive rock which runs from Cochise stronghold 

 along the south side of Tweed Canyon westward to the mesa; no 

 Holospiras being found on this ridge, so far as we know. The isola- 

 tion of the two species seems, therefore, to be complete. The species 

 is quite constant in hundreds of shells collected from many colonies, 

 as noted below; but in two stations in small hills on the mesa east- 

 ward of Middlemarch Canyon there is notable variation. Further 

 study should be given to these small forms of the border between 

 mountain and plain. In over a hundred shells opened from all the 

 colonies, only one has a very weak trace of a superior lamella, all 

 others having only a stout axial lamella. 



The type locality. Station 7, is on the divide, a ridge above an 

 abandoned mine and cabin. It may be reached by ascending Cata- 

 ract Gulch from Tweed Canyon, but much more easily along the 

 mountains eastward, as the gulch is rather a neckbreaker. The 

 specimens are quite uniform in sculpture. Length up to 12.2 mm., 

 and very rarely as short as 9.3 mm., with 10 whorls. (PI. XV, figs. 

 3, 3a, 36). Out of twenty opened, one has a weak, hardl}^ perceptible 

 trace of the superior lamella, the others having the axial lamella 

 only. A series of 1000 or more was taken. It occurs under stones, 

 etc., in places where there is no shade.

At the adjacent Station 8, eastward and slightly higher, the 

 shells average smaller — about 10.5 mm. long — but are otherwise 

 similar. 



Station 29. Bear Gulch, near top, and Station 30, ridge west of 

 Bear Gulch, typical shells. 



Stations 31, 32, on the east side, and Station 33 on the west side 

 of Soren Gulch, typical shells. 



Station 34- A small limestone hill in Middlemarch Canyon. 

 The shells have perceptibly coarser sculptures than in the types, 

 about 70 riblets on the penultimate whorl. One internal lamella, 

 the axial. 



Station 35. Cochise Peak. Similar to the shells from Station 34. 



Station 36. Small limestone hills eastward on the mesa of Middle- 

 march Canyon. The shells here are smaller than typical millestriata, 

 and vary from the typical fine ribbing to somewhat coarser (PL XV, 

 figs. 4, 4a, the prevalent form), and a few are as coarsely sculptured 

 as H. campestris cochisei, the coarsest having 48 ribs on the penulti- 

 mate whorl. The proportions of diameter to length also vary a 

 good deal, as shown in the figures and measurements. All the speci- 

 mens opened have a single lamella, the axial.

 as well as in various features of the adult shell. 



We do not find in the shells of the Warren form any constant 

 difference from those of the type locality; but the genitalia (PI. XI, 

 fig. 2) and jaw (PI. XI, fig. 26) differ somewhat in the only living 

 adult taken. The penis has scarcely any sheath; only a few fibres 

 bind the epiphallus. Flagellum more minute. Penis-papilla (fig. 

 2a) nearly half the length of the penis, tapering and wrinkled. The 

 penial retractor is inserted on the epiphallus near its base. The 

 vagina is nearly as long as the penis. Length of penis lOJ mm.; 

 epiphallus 10 mm.; penis-papilla 5 mm.; vagina 9 mm. 



The jaw (PI. XI, fig. 26) has about 5 weakly developed ribs.

The shell is very shortly rimate, cylindric, with short terminal 

 cone, wood brown or avellaneous, the last half of the last whorl 

 opaque white; composed of 10| to 13| whorls, the first two smooth. 

 The last half of the second and first half of the third whorl are narrower 

 than the preceding and following whorls, as usual, and the apex 

 projects somewhat nipple-like. Following whorls of the cone are 

 quite convex, and are sharply, closely and obliquely striate. On 

 the cylindrical portion the whorls are only weakly convex, and 

 gradually lose the striae, so that the penultimate and often one or 

 two earlier whorls are smooth or nearly so, the last half-whorl becom- 

 ing strongly, sharply striate again. The last whorl is compressed 

 laterally on the back but becomes rounded near the aperture, pre- 

 ceding which it is somewhat contracted. The aperture is rotund- 

 ovate, peristome shortly free of the preceding whorl, and quite 

 narrowly expanded. Internal axis rather small, in the last part of 

 the penultimate and the beginning of the last whorl becoming a 

 moderate, obtuse lamella. Typically there are no other lamellae, 

 but in a small number of specimens a superior lamella, or superior 

 and basal lamellae are developed, both very weak.

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 387 



Type No. 112,236, A. N. S. P., collected by Pilsbry and Daniels, 

 August 29, 1910. 



The Escabrosa Ridge, or mountain side on the left, ascending 

 the first left-hand ravine above Bisbee on the Tombstone Road, is 

 the home of this Holospira. Extensive burning of the brush has 

 narrowed their range and decreased their numbers, at least for the 

 time, so that the series collected was not large.^ Some very small 

 scrub oaks remain in places; there are three species of agave, some 

 sotol and bear-grass, a few cylindropuntias, and many herbaceous 

 plants, now after the summer rains gay with flowers; over everything 

 a little scarlet morning-glory, which we afterward found common 

 in the ranges westward. 



Out of 20 shells opened, 18 have the axial lamella only; one has 

 also a small superior or parietal, and one has superior and basal 

 lamellse, both very low and small. 



This is a larger and longer species than H. ferrissi, and further 

 distinguished by the smooth later whorls and deficient internal 

 lamellse. The Chiricahuan H. arizonensis Stearns differs chiefly 

 by having the internal lamellse larger. 

 Holospira ferrissi fossor n. subsp. PI. XV, figs. 6 to 66. 



The short, cylindric shell is ribbed throughout, with about 47 ribs 

 on the penultimate whorl. The last whorl is conspicuously flattened 

 on. the back, then gibbous (the gibbosity internally filled with white 

 shelly material) and contracting to the aperture, the basal crest 

 rather conspicuous. These features are more conspicuous than in 

 H. ferrissi. There is an obtuse axial lamella in the front of the last 

 whorl, and typically no other lamellse; but three specimens out of 

 20 opened show a weak parietal lamella also. The color is wood 

 brown or avellaneous, with the usual white patch on the last whorl.

of hills which reach about 5,500 feet elevation. On the northern 

 and northwestern slopes of one of these, about two miles east of the 

 town, we collected Sonorella, Holospira and some smaller shells. 

 Holospira is very abundant (over 1,500 collected by H. A. P.), 

 living in mellow earth under stones, in "nests" of from six to twenty 

 or more, usually standing vertically, apex up, and buried in earth 

 up to the summit. While the sculpture of this species is coarser 

 than that of typical H. cionella, yet there are some equally coarse 

 individuals of the latter. It is quite possible that H. cionella may 

 eventually be ranked as a subspecies of H ferrissi. 



In the debris of the San Pedro River above the S. P. R. R. bridge, 

 near Benson, Arizona, we found three specimens representing as 

 many races of Holospira. One is the upper half of a slowly tapering 

 species, evidently new. The others are probably races of H. ferrissi. 

 One specimen has the appearance of a small H. f. fossor. It has the 

 same sculpture, a low axial lamella, and measures, length 7.6, diam. 

 3.1 mm., 9f whorls. 



The other shell resembles H. ferrissi in having three internal 

 lamellae, the superior and axial lamellae being strongly developed. 

 .The ribbing is as fine as in the most finely ribbed ferrissi — decidedly 

 finer than in fossor. The form is more slender than in ferrissi. 

 This shell apparently represents another subspecies or local race 

 of H. ferrissi. As it may have drifted a long distance, it had better 

 be left nameless until found in its natural habitat. 

 Holospira ferrissi sanctaecrucis n. subsp. PI. XV, fig. 7. 



The shell is similar to the most slender and fine-ribbed examples 

 of H. ferrissi in form and sculpture, except that the apical whorls 

 are more mucronate. The three internal lamellae are lateral in posi- 

 tion, strongly developed, especially the superior one, w^iich is a half- 

 whorl long.

Valley of the Santa Cruz River, above Tucson, Arizona. Type 

 No. 112,239, A. N. S. P., found in flood debris of the river a short 

 distance above the Congress St. bridge, Tucson. 



This is some distance west of any other record of Holospira in the 

 United States. In Mexico the genus extends to the Gulf of Cali- 

 fornia. The lamellae are much stronger than in any of the lot of 

 H. ferrissi which we have opened. 



Although there cannot be much doubt that this species inhabits 

 some limestone hill not far from the river, we failed to find it in the 

 quite limited time we spent in the neighborhood. It may have

floated many miles, as the river merits that name in time of flood, 

 though usually reduced to a chain of infrequent pools or an insig- 

 nificant rivulet. The term river, in the arid belt, refers to the bed 

 and banks rather than to the water, which is often conspicuous for 

 its absence during a great part of the year.

III. Benson, Arizona. 



Benson, Cochise Co., at the junction of the Southern Pacific and 

 El Paso and Southwestern Railroads, is in a flat region, with no mol- 

 lusk fauna in its immediate environs. The San Pedro River, flowing 

 northward about a mile east of the town, brings down considerable 

 flood debris containing shells. The source of these is probably in the 

 foothills of the Whetstone Mountains, not far away; possibly also 

 the hill country about Tombstone, or even further south. 



The San Pedro carries more water than any other stream in the 

 lower tier of counties between the Rio Grande and the Colorado, 

 and so far as we know it is the only one maintaining a constant flow. 

 At Benson it is a turbid stream 20 to 30 feet wide, with vertical, 

 dirt banks about 8 feet high (September 1st), meandering in a flood 

 plain covered with mesquite. 



Mr. Ferriss collected a few shells from the river drift in 1904; and 

 in 1910 Pilsbry and Daniels, having an hour or two between trains, 

 collected a small bag of shell-bearing debris near the S. P. R. R. 

 bridge. In this sample the most abundant moUusk is Bifidaria 

 procera cristata. The small Zonitoides, Bifidaria p. hordeacella, 

 Pupoides marginata and Vertigo ovata are next in abundance. AU 

 the species except Vallonia gracilicosta are Lower Sonoran forms.

colonies were found near by. Our second camp was at the cabin in 

 the saddle at the head of Agua Caliente Canyon, somewhat above 

 7,000 feet and close to collecting Station 6 of map. There is a good 

 spring. The best collecting is in Walnut Canyon, Station 5, where 

 three species of Sonorella live. From above this camp there is fine 

 timber, but no land shells worth mentioning up to the summit of 

 Mt. Hopkins. Good collecting stations were found in Madera 

 Canyon which would be an excellent place to camp. We also reached 

 the head of Josephine Canyon from this camp. A two-day excursion 

 was made, via Brandt's mining camp, over the 8,500-foct saddle 

 north of Old Baldy, and down Camperel Canyon^ to perhaps 7,000

 down. Also some huge spruce and hemlock trees. We passed 

 through aspens, then small-leaved maples, to walnuts, in the bed 

 of the canyon. Sonorella clappi occurs here, and a few specimens of 

 a Sonorella (occidentalis) , which we provisionally rank as a subspecies 

 of the Huachucan S. granulatissimo. It will be seen that our work 

 extended nearly across the middle of the highest part of the range 

 in a rather narrow band, the collecting stations being marked on the 

 accompanying tracing simplified from the U. S. G. S. topographic map.

The absence of the common western Sonorellas (santaritana and 

 walkeri) on the eastern slope, and the occurrence there of another 

 species (S. g. occidentalis) indicates a certain amount of local faunal 

 differentiation, and it seems likely that work in the northern, southern 

 or eastern parts of the range would result in a number of additional 

 species of Sonorella. By the absence of Oreohelix and Ashmunella 

 (in the parts we explored), the Santa Ritas differ remarkably from 

 the Huachucas, the next range eastward. 



We obtained very few small shells.

body, it has a basal sheath, and a slender, conspicuously annul ated 

 papilla, one-third the length of the penis or longer. The flagellum is 

 well developed for Sonorella. The penial retractor is inserted at the 

 apex of penis and base of epiphallus. The vas deferens is slender 

 throughout. Measurements of the organs in mm. follow. 



Specimens from Station 11, and numerous others from Station 5, 

 opened but not measured, were sufficiently examined to show that 

 the specific characters — great length of penis and vagina— are con- 

 stant. 



S. santaritana differs from other species of the same range by its 

 wider umbilicus, the more approaching ends of the lip, and especially 

 by the great length of penis and vagina. In the characters of the 

 genitalia it is nearest to S. rinconensis P. and F. (these Proceedings 

 for 1909, PI. XXII, fig. 5). That species differs by having a still 

 longer vagina, and a more capacious shell with larger aperture and 

 relatively smaller umbilicus. S. dalli and *S'. virilis are somewhat 

 related, but differ in characters of both genitalia and shell. 



This is the most abundant and widely distributed Sonorella of 

 the part of the Santa Rita Range which we explored. 



In size, specimens from Walnut Canyon (PI. IX, figs. 1-26) measured 

 from 19 to 25.8 mm. diameter, but only in one colony were such 

 small ones found, the minimum size in other colonies is about 21.5 

 mm. 



In Stations 10, 11 and 14 they run from 20.4 to 22.5 mm. In 

 other stations the size is about typical. 



A beautiful albino (PI. IX, fig. 3) was taken at Station 5. It shows 

 very faint traces of the shoulder band and the embryonic shell is 

 faintly buff, but otherwise it is pure white. Genitalia as in .the 

 colored form.

 yon," at about 4,500 feet, and in Madera Canyon at Stations 7, 8 

 and 15. 



This fine species, named for Dr. Bryant Walker, is not uncommon, 

 though less generally distributed than S. santaritana. In the type 

 locality it lives with *S. santaritana and *S. clappi, sometimes all under 

 the same rock, sometimes in separate rock piles. The smallest 

 specimens, Station 5, measure 20 mm. in diameter; the largest, 

 Station 15, 24.3 mm. 



Station 3 is in a small canyon running in north of the mouth of 

 Agua Caliente, opening to the mesa between two high granite crags. 

 The rock is a coarse granite, and shells are not numerous. A single 

 giant cactus growing here is further east than we have seen the 

 species elsewhere. 



Many specimens have been dissected. The slender, short penis, 

 with a short, thick basal sheath, and the enlarged free vas deferens

are conspicuous characters. The smaller umbilicus and less de- 

 pressed contour separate it from S. santaritana, which also differs 

 more fundamentally by its genitalia. S. walkeri is very much like 

 S. clappi in soft anatomy. Its relation to S. huachucana Pils. 

 remains to be defined when that species shall have been dissected. 

 Measurements of the organs in mm. follow. 



Sonorella walkeri aguacalientensis n. subsp. PI. IX, figs. 5, 5a, 5b, 6, 6a, 66. 



A form with the shell not constantly distinguishable from S. 



ivalkeri was found in some abundance at Stations 1 and 2, in the 



mouth of Agua Caliente 

 Canyon. Station 1 is in 

 rocks on the bank of the 

 wash running out of the 

 canyon, immediatelj' 

 southeast of the fine 

 spring of tepid water 

 which gives this canj^on 

 its name. This is the 

 lowest Station for anj^ 

 snail found in these 

 mountains, the elevation 

 being about 3,800 feet. 

 All of the alcoholic speci- 

 mens of this lot were lost 

 after leaving the moun- 

 tains, so that the ana- 

 tomical characters are 

 unknown. The shells 

 measure 19 to 24 mm. in 

 diameter and live in 



crevices or under fragments of a friable, shale-like rhyolite, of a dark 



vinaceous-drab color. See PI. IX, figs. 6, 6a, db.

Station 2, at the base of bluffs southeast of Station 1 and somewhat 

 higher, afforded a few similar shells (PL IX, figs. 5, 5a, 56). One 

 preserved in spirit differs from S. walkexi by having a decidedly 

 longer penis, penis-papilla and epiphallus. There is no fiagellum, 

 and no penial retractor muscle was found. (Fig. 5.) These differ- 

 ences, if confirmed by further dissections, in our opinion, indicate 

 a distinct species; but to direct attention to it we now rank the 

 race as a subspecies of S. walkeri. The diameter at Station 2 runs 

 from 22.3 to 24 mm. The elevation of this Station is between 

 4,100 and 4,200 feet, according to the topographic map. 



Sorujrella clappi n. sp. PI. IX, f5gs. 8, 8a, 86. 



The shell is umbilicate (umbilicus contained about 8 times in the 

 diameter), thin, depressed, semimatt, cinnamon, the base paler, 

 fading to olive-buff in the middle, and with a chestnut-brown shoulder 

 band having paler borders. Embryonic shell of If whorls, the 

 initial I whorl smooth, the rest densely and evenly reticulate-granu- 

 lous, having an indistinct zigzag pattern in some places, but without 

 the spirally descending threads of the hachitana type. Subsequent 

 whorls are lightly striate and microscopically wrinkle-granose, this 

 sculpture becoming weaker on the base. Whorls 4|, the last descend- 

 ing in front, rounded peripherally. Aperture rounded-oval, the 

 peristome thin, narrowly expanded.

Genitalia (PI. XII, figs. 6, 7). — Penis slender throughout, with a 

 thick, short basal sheath and a long papilla. Epiphallus and vas

Walnut branch of Agua Caliente; and Stations 17 and 17|, Camperel 

 Canyon, on the eastern slope of the mountains, at about 6,500 feet. 



This is a smaller, thinner shell than other Santa Rita Sonorellas, 

 and readily distinguished by its microscopic granulation and the 

 beautiful sculpture of the embryo. It is variable in degree of eleva- 

 tion of the spire, size of umljilicus and color. In Madera Canyon 

 the shell has a russet hue. 



In Walnut Branch of Agua Caliente the color ranges from almost 

 chamois in the thicker old individuals to nearly water green in those 

 barely grown to full size. The microscopic granulation is sometimes 

 typically developed on the last whorl, but more often more or less 

 obsolete, sometimes only visible in a few places; and most specimens 

 show incised spiral lines on the last whorl, occasionally quite distinct 

 and numerous. Around the head of Agua Caliente Canyon the color 

 is similar to the Walnut Branch lot. 



S. clappi resembles the Huachucan S. granulatissima and S. 

 danielsi in the embryonic sculpture and the general appearance, but 

 in those species the aperture is more oblique than usual in S. clappi 

 and the genitalia are conspicuously different. Having dissected a 

 good many individuals of all of these species, I feel confident that 

 the genitalia afford the most reliable specific characters. S. dapyi 

 is very much like *S. walkeri in genitalia. 



A couple of shells from Station 17^, Camperel Canj^on, on the 

 eastern slope of the range, resemble the Agua Caliente form in being 

 light colored. One from Station 17, in the same canyon, is the 

 darkest of all, being nearly a sorghum-brown color, more vinaceous 

 where the cuticle is worn off. The genitalia (PI. XII, figs. 4, 4a) 

 differ from typical S. clappi by the longer penis and penis sheath, 

 and the shorter vagina. Length of penis 13, penis-papilla 10, epi- 

 phallus 10, flagellum 1, vagina 4^ mm. 



A bleached Sonorella, No. 105,385, U. S. N. M., collected, or at 

 least sent to Dr. I. Lea in 1860, by H. C. Grovenor, is labelled "Santa 

 Rita Mountains, 6,000 feet above the sea." It is very thin and 

 appears under the lens to have been granular. The lip-ends con- 

 verge, as in S. clappi, from which this shell differs by its larger size 

 and less depressed shape; diam. 20.5 mm. It is probably a distinct 

 species related to S. clappi, but it is not in condition for description. 

 The spire is broken. 

 Sonorella granulatissima occidentalis a. subsp. PI. IX, figs. 7, 7a, 7b. 



Similar in sculpture to *S. granulatissima, but differing by the 

 narrower last whorl, which is less convex above; the light borders of 

 the chestnut-brown band, and the less depressed spire.

 northeastern flank of Old Baldy. Type No. 112J65, A. N. S. P. 



We regret that the jar containing the soft parts of this species 

 proved leaky, and its contents were lost. It seems to be related to 

 S. granulatissima, as the sculpture is very similar. 



V. Small Ranges and Hills of the Santa Cruz River Valley. 



Between Tucson and Nogales and the Santa Rita and Baboquivari 

 Mountains there are many buttes and ranges of hills or small moun- 

 tains, a few of which we visited, finding in each a special species of 

 Sonorella and sometimes a few small shells. 



Among the more important ranges which should be investigated 

 we may mention the Tumacacori (or Atascoso) range, an extensive 

 mass of arid looking mountains, extending south to the Mexican 

 line, and probably supporting little but Sonorella. They are easily 

 accessible from the Sonora R. R., being about 6 miles from ''Siding 

 No. 4." These mountains on the south pass into the Sierra de los 

 Pajaritos, which lie west of Nogales — "a confused mass of rocky 

 crags, peaks, flat-topped mountains with vertical sides, enormous 

 trachyte dykes, steep narrow ridges and deep canyons." They are 

 covered with "a fine growth of oak, juniper and manzanita, while 

 magnificent walnut, sycamore and ash trees line the canyons." 

 Water supply precarious except in the wet seasons. These fine 

 mountains are unknown to the conchologist. 



Various species reported from Tucson were certainly brought 

 there from more or less distant localities. Sonorella granulatissima, 

 reported by Bartsch, Smiths. Misc. Coll., Vol. 47, p. 193, and Ash- 

 munella varicifera Ancey are Huachucan species. The following 

 species were taken in the drift debris of the Santa Cruz River, near 

 Tucson, chiefly above the bridge. The fresh-water shells are mainly 

 fossils, washed out of, or exposed upon the low dirt banks, where 

 the stream has cut down through a former 'Cie7ieg a. Part of the land 

 shells probably washed in from the Tumamoc and other eastern 

 foothills of the Tucson Range. We found Bifidaria tuba and Thysan- 

 ophora hornii on the Tumamoc Hills, and with other minutiae, in 

 debris washed down from the hills at the hill terminus of Congress St.

This is a rather globose species with narrow umbilicus, quite 

 unlike anything we found. The type is a bleached specimen found 

 in the Santa Cruz River at Tucson, which no doubt drifted down 

 from above. As no Sonorella lives at or near the river level, it must 

 have been washed down from some . mountain or rocky hill in the

 of the drift debris of the Santa Cruz which we looked over did not 

 produce a second specimen, though minute shells were abundant. 

 Only by a rare chance would so turbulent a stream as the Santa Cruz . 

 in flood carry Sonorella very far. In its ordinary condition there is a 

 succession of small pools connected, in places, by a slender rivulet; 

 but after heavy rain we have seen turl^id water from bank to bank 

 for a brief time. 



Sonorella tumamocensis n. sp. P!. X, figs. 4, 4a, 46. 



The shell is depressed, umbilicate (umbilicus contained about 

 6 times in the diameter of the shell), thin, light pinkish cinnamon, 

 fading to whitish on the base, and having indistinct whitish borders 

 above and below the rather narrow chestnut-brown shoulder band. 

 Apical sculpture is of the hachitcma type, but usually very Vv^eak, the 

 initial half-whorl smooth, without the usual radial ripples; the 

 rest of the embryonic shell is marked with a few delicate, interrupted 

 tangential (protractive) threads, on a nearly smooth ground, having 

 weak growth ripples only. The subsequent neanic and last whorls 

 have weak growth lines. Whorls 4^, convex, the last slowly de- 

 scending in front. Aperture rounded, nearly as high as wide. Peri- 

 stome thin, the outer and basal margins very narrowly expanded. 

 The columellar lip, in basal view, shows very little dilation. 



Alt. 10.5, diam. 17.5 mm.; aperture 8.7 x 9.5 mm.; umbilicus

Genitalia (PI. XIII, fig. 5). — The penis is about as long as the 

 vagina, slender in its lower part, somewhat swollen above. Around 

 the base there is a very short sheath of very loose open texture. It 

 contains a slender, slowly tapering papilla about one-third as long as 

 the penis, its surface closely grooved spirally, the apex obtuse but 

 small. The epiphallus is slender, terminating in a vestigeal, bud- 

 like flagellum. The retractor muscle is inserted on the epiphallus. 

 Other organs as usual. 



Top of the head and back are slate-colored, shading into gray 

 on the sides, whitish towards the edges of the foot. Tail and sole 

 white. Faint lines define the three areas of the sole. Jaw (PI.

Tumamoc Hill, near Tucson, Pima Co., Arizona. Types No. 

 112,245, A. N. S. P., collected by Ferriss, Pilsbrj^ and Daniels, 

 October 1, 1910; topotypes in collections of Ferriss and Daniels. 

 Specimens were taken by Mr. J. C. Blumer under volcanic cliffs 

 on the northeast side of Cat Mountain, in the Tucson Range. 



The shell closeh" resembles S. eremita of the Mineral Hill group, 

 but it is much thinner with the peristome decidedly less expanded 

 and the embryonic whorls smoother. The penis is very much 

 longer than in eremita. A comparison with the unique type of 

 S. arizonensis Dall, kindly made bj^ Dr. Paul Bartsch, shows that 

 that species is quite distinct. 



We would be disposed to consider tumamocensis a subspecies of 

 S. rowelli were it not that in individuals having the shell about the 

 same size as rowelli the penis, penis-papilla, epiphallus and vagina 

 are about twice as long; the spermathecal duct remaining about 

 equal in the two species. The shape of the penis-papilla is different, 

 that of tumamocensis being longer, slender and tapering. For 

 comparison we have added measurements of the organs of S. rowelli 

 to the table on p. ,408. The columellar lip dilates much less than in 

 >S. comobabiensis or S. sitiens. 



The penis is verj- much longer, its papilla both absolute^ and 

 relatively much shorter than in S. papagorum. 



The Tumamoc Hills are an outlying spur of the Tucson Range, 

 about a mile from Tucson west of the Santa Cruz River. There are 

 three hills: Tumamoc, 3,092 feet, on the northern slope of which 

 the Desert Botanical Laboratory' of the Carnegie Institution of 

 Washington stands; Sentinel, 2,885 feet, and a lower nameless hill 

 of 2,672 feet elevation. The hills are volcanic, formed of an old 

 andesite flow, largely covered by rhyolite (which is the characteristic 

 rock of the Tucson Range) and later flows of basalt.^ Sonorella 

 occurred in great piles of black basalt, on the north slope of Tumamoc 

 Hill, from just below the fiat summit down half way to the Desert 

 Laboratory. Most of them were taken not far from the 2,750-foot 

 contour (our Station 35). Living snails are very scarce and hard 

 to get. None were found on the other slopes of Tumamoc Hill, 

 nor could we find them on Sentinel Hill. On the ^,672-foot hill, 

 at the end of Congress St., we took only Bifidaria tuba. 



'' Topographic and geological maps of these hills, with accounts of their physical 

 features and vegetation, may be found in the following publications of the Carnegie 

 Institution of Washington: D. T. Macdougal: Botanical features of North 

 American deserts, 1908. Volney M. Spalding: Distribution and movements of 

 desert plants, 1909.

Sonorella papagorum n. sp. PI. VIII, figs. 8, 80, 86. 



The shell is depressed, umbilicate (the umbilicus contained about

 light pinkish cinnamon, fading to whitish around the umbilicus, and a 

 trifle pale at the edges of a dark chestnut-brown band at the shoulder. 

 Apical sculpture is of the hachitana type, but very weakly developed, 

 the initial half-whorl smooth, the rest of the embryonic shell similar 

 to that of S. tumamocensis. "Subsequent whorls are lightly marked 

 with growi;h lines. Whorls 4f , convex, the last descending slowly

 The slender epiphallus bears the retractor muscle and terminates 

 in a very minute flagellum. Female organs as usual. Jaw (fig. 6) has 

 five or six strong, unequal ribs, or in one specimen four unequal 

 weaker ribs. It is quite variable.

494 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juiie, 



Black Mountain is a rather remote and isolated outlier of the 

 Tucson Range, which has here its southeastern terminus. It is a 

 long, straight, level-topped ridge, divided by a deep gap into a 

 longer and a shorter mountain. The slopes are everywhere very 

 steep, covered with black basalt, like Tumamoc Hill at Tucson. 

 Slides of this rock occupy a large part of the slopes. Between the 

 slides, which are, of course, barren of vegetation, there is some desert 

 verdure. Ocotillo, mesquite, cat-claw, palo verde, etc., are typical 

 plants, and giant cacti grow on the south side. No agave or sotol 

 were seen. The Sonorellas are found rather deep in the slides. 

 They probably inhabit the whole northern slope, but we worked 

 only a couple of hours, on the north side of the east end, close under 

 the summit. Some hazard attends the hunt in these slides, which 

 axe s® steep that the heavy rock starts to move on small provocation. 

 Black Mountain, like the rest of the Tucson Range, is very dry. 

 It stands on a plain much lower than the Mineral Hill group and 

 higher than Tucson. The station where Sonorella was collected 

 we would roughly estimate as 3,200 or 3,300 feet above the sea. 

 Sonorella eremita n. sp. PI. VIII, figs. 7 to 7e. 



The shell is globose-depressed, umbilicate (the width of umbilicus 

 contained about 6^ times in the diameter of shell), more solid than 

 other species of the same region, glossy, pinkish buff, fading to nearly 

 white around the umbilicus, and having a chestnut-brown shoulder 

 band, without noticeable light borders. The embryonic shell, of 

 about 1| whorls, has strongly developed sculpture of the hachitana 

 type. The initial half-whorl has some radial ripples or wrinkles; 

 then there appears a series of long, protractive threads on the outer 

 two-thirds, meeting shorter forwardly ascending threads on the 

 inner third; the intervals occupied by short radial impressions. 

 The threads are subject to more or less interruption, particularly 

 on the greatest convexity of the whorl. The later whorls are marked 

 with very fine, unequal growth-lines. 



The spire is very low, conoidal. Whorls 4|, moderately convex, 

 the last slowly descending in front. The oblique aperture is rounded, 

 but slightly wider than high. Peristome slightly expanded above, 

 the outer and basal margins expanding more, slightly thickened, 

 the margins converging, connected by a very thin parietal film.

In the genitalia, as well as the shell, this species resembles S. 

 papagorum, but it differs by having a smaller penis and by the very 

 slender epiphallus, which is actually smaller than the vas deferens 

 in several specimens dissected. In S. tumamocensis the penis is 

 very much longer. The shell is smaller than S. popagorum, with 

 far more strongly developed apical scidpture than in any other species 

 of this cUstrict. It is also more solid, and, having an aspect of its 

 own, is not likely to be confused with any other Sonorella knoA\Ti 

 to us. 



The size is quite variable:

There was a scalariform specimen among the bones. It measures

 diameter should be about 9.5 mm. 



The Mineral Hill group. Twin Buttes and Tinaja Hills are much 

 degraded outliers of the Sierrita Mountains. Only the Mineral 

 Hill group has been worked for land snails, though all doubtless 

 have Sonorellas — and very little else. 



The Mineral Hills are about 20 miles west of south from Tucson 

 and about 7 miles north of the Sierritas.^ They stand at the summit 

 of a long slope, rising about 1,000 feet in ten miles from San Xavier 

 del Bac, on a mesa of perhaps 3,600 feet elevation. The xerophytic 

 vegetation extends over the hills, mesquite, cat-claw, palo verde, 

 ocotillo and sotol being the more conspicuous plants, to which may 

 be added tree cacti on southern slopes, and on the mesa many opun- 

 tias, cylindropuntias and a few barrel cacti and yuccas. The 

 absence of Agave is peculiar. These hills are a favorite resort of 

 rattlesnakes. I got also a coral snake. No mollusks whatever 

 were found on Mineral Hill or Helmet Peak. San Xavier Hill is 

 composed of white subcarboniferous limestone, like the hills south- 

 eastward, except at the western end, which is whitish quartz, with a 

 spur to the north of coarse pinkish-gray granite. There is a depres- 

 sion in this end of the hill, between short, low cliffs of white quartz. 

 The cliff towards the south has partly fallen in a tumble of huge 

 blocks with some smaller stone between them. This talus is perhaps 

 200 feet long to the last scattered blocks, and at the widest 40 feet 

 wide; its lower end about 200 feet above the mesa. In it we found 

 the Sonorella described above. "Bones" were abundant, but living 

 snails extremely scarce, and confined to the deeper portions of the 

 talus, between the piled-up quartz blocks. The entire range of this 

 species is not much greater than the area occupied by a moderate- 

 sized house. In this insignificant fastness it is making a last stand 

 against extermination. 



We found no snails in a hill covered with granite boulders about 

 3 miles north of west from San Xavier Hill. It is possible, though 

 unlikely, that some insignificant colony may exist there. 



s While there we occupied a comfortable camp at the copper mine of Mr. 

 L. D. Chilson, of Tucson, whose courtesy we would here acknowledge.

 wide band above the foot edges whitish. 



Genitalia (PL XIII, fig. 3). — The penis is swollen distally, becoming 

 narrow in its basal half, which is enveloped in a muscular sheath, 

 the outer edge of which is attached to the end of the epiphallus. 

 The penis-papilla is extremely short and wide, cylindric, with a few 

 annular corrugations and a shortly "conic end. The epiphallus is 

 slender, swollen at" its distal end, without trace of a flagellum. The 

 lower part of the vagina is very stout. Other organs as usual. 

 Jaw (PI. XIII, fig. 7) has 8 strong, narrow ribs. 

 Northwestern end of Las Gijas above Las Gijas Mine, Pima Co., 

 Arizona. Types No. 112,158, A. N. S. P., taken by Ferriss and 

 Pilsbry, September 27, 1910. 



The shell is less solid than S. eremita, the aperture decidedly larger, 

 the umbilicus smaller. The color also is darker. It differs from 

 eremita conspicuously in the genitalia, the penis of S. sitiens being 

 provided with a sheath of half its length, and the papilla being 

 extremely short and stout, while in S. eremita the sheath is repre- 

 sented only by a few loose muscular fibres at the base, and the 

 papilla is very slender and comparatively long. No other Sonorella 

 known has a penis-papilla like that of S. sitiens. Several specimens 

 dissected are entirely similar in genitalia. 



The spire is very low in most of the specimens, but in one (PI. 

 VIII, fig. 5c) it is more conic. In this shell the white borders of the 

 shoulder band are very narrow. It measures, alt. 12, diam. 18.5 

 mm., aperture 9.5 mm. high, 10.8 wide. 

 Five other adult shells measure:

The most closely related species seems to be S. rowelli. This, 

 however, has a larger penis-papilla and a slightly wider umbilicus. 



The low and inconspicuous range Las Gijas (the Quartz Hills) 

 lies south of the well-known landmark Cerro Colorado, and west of 

 the northern end of the Tumacacori Range. At the northwest 

 end there is a mine, and a ranch building stands on the bank of a 

 small stream, the Gija Wash. The hill above the mine is strewn 

 with rounded boulders of coarse-grained granite, weathering to 

 angular gravel. Most of the loose rock is too massive to move, so 

 that suitable situations for snails are scarce. We found the first 

 Sonorellas on the slope above the mine. Working up over the 

 rounded top of the hill and along the ridge a half mile south we 

 crossed a low rock dyke, where a few more shells and a large colubrine 

 snake were taken. None were found among the rocks at the head 

 of the canyon east of this ridge. The other hills at this end of the 

 range are rounded, grassy, with little rock. On top there is much 

 sotol, ocotillo, a few cacti, etc. We found the pygmy Agave parvi- 

 flora here. It was not seen elsewhere. 



In the debris of the Gija Wash we found Thysanophora liornii 

 (Gabb), Zonitoides minuscula (Binn.) and Bifidaria pelleucida hor- 

 deaceUa (Pils.). 



Measurements of the genitalia of the preceding species are here 

 given together. The species identified as S. roivelli (Nc.) in these 

 Proceedings for 1905 being added for comparison.

The shell resembles S. sitiens, but differs in these features: the 

 umbilicus is decidedly wider, its diameter contained 6 to nearly 7 

 times in that of the shell; the color is paler; the aperture is notice- 

 ably smaller. The embryonic 1| whorls show distinct spirally 

 protractive threads in young individuals.

Cerro Colorado, around the base of a conspicuous crag at the south- 

 eastern end of the range. Types No. 112,160, A. N. S. P., collected 

 by Pilsbry and Ferriss, September 28, 1910. 



The first two measurements are of cotypes from the south side of 

 the crag. The third specimen measured is the only adult shell taken 

 on the north side of the crag, perhaps a hundred feet higher. 



This form stands very close to S. sitiens, yet the difference in the 

 size of umbilicus is constant in the small series examined; no com- 

 munication between the colonies of Cerro Colorado and Las Gijas 

 can have taken place for a very long period, so that in the present 

 state of our knowledge it seems proper to keep the forms of the two 

 hill-groups subspecifically separate. 



Unfortunately, no living examples were found, so that the ana- 

 tomical characterization of the subspecies remains to be worked out. 



The Cerro Colorado ("Red Hill") lies a few hours' travel north of 

 Las Gijas. The northern slopes are grassy and rounded, but west 

 and south it is carved into bold, fantastic crags and pinnacles of 

 dull red rhyolite — a landmark which catches the eye for a long distance. 



Our work here was brief. Scarcely an hour was spent around a 

 <;rag which stands at the southeastern extremity, about two miles 

 from the Cerro Colorado Mine on the Aravaca Road. Here the 

 Sonorella described above was taken, only a few dead specimens. 

 No doubt, the cliffs westward, higher up, would yield better results, 

 though little can be expected in such a dry situation. Neighboring 

 low crags of milk-white quartz, at a lower level southward, were 

 found barren. 

 Sonorella sitiens comobabiensis n. subsp. 



The shell is similar to S. sitiens in general shape, its mdth contained 

 about 9 times in the greatest diameter of the shell. It is smaller 

 within, and enlarges more in the last whorl than that of *S. tuma-

mocensis, but the enlargement is largely concealed by the overhanging 

 and dilated columellar lip. It is light pinkish cinnamon, fading to 

 white around the umbilicus, usually with a white streak on the last 

 whorl, left by a former resting stage, and with white bands above 

 and below the rather wide chestnut-brown shoulder band. The 

 apical sculpture is of the sitiens type, but some interrupted, descend- 

 ing spiral threads are visible on the best examples; subsequent 

 whorls are lightly marked with growth lines. The aperture is 

 larger than in S. tumamocensis, but less ample than that of *S. vesperus. 

 The peristome expands cUstinctly, though narrowly.

Comobabi Mountains, at the base of a cliff on the north side of 

 the highest part of the range, elevation about 4,000 feet. Type and 

 paratypes No. 112,252, A. N. S. P., other paratypes in Ferriss col- 

 lection. Also taken in the Cababi Hills, about 10 miles westward, 

 in a slide of volcanic rock on the north side of the highest peak, 

 about 3,000 feet elevation. All were collected by Mr. J. C. Blumer, 

 of Tucson, in the course of botanical exploration. 



About 120 specimens were collected, some of them showing the 

 surface and color unimpaired, though all were dead shells. We are 

 therefore unable to give any information on the soft parts. The 

 shell is very much like S. sitiens of Las Gijas, further south, and east 

 of the Baboquivari Range; but on account of the wide separation of 

 the localities, it is likely to be subspecifically or even specifically 

 distinct. 



The Comobabi Mountains form a short range, about 75 miles 

 west of Tucson. The Cababi Hills, immediately west, and the 

 Qui-i-tomoc Hills, a short distance south, are parts of the same 

 group. It is evidently rich in shells, as Mr. Blumer found *S. s. 

 comobahiensis on the highest peaks (near the south end) of both 

 Comobabi and Cababi, and a form which we cannot distinguish 

 from S. vespertina on the north side of the largest peak of the Qui-i- 

 tomoc Hills. Somewhere in the Cababi Mountains, the exact location 

 not given, Mr. Frank Cole collected two forms, which we provision- 

 ally refer to *S. ashmuni as varieties; one of them is the largest 

 Sonorella known. 



Sonorella ashmuni capax n. subsp. PI. X, figs. 7, 7a, 7b. 



The shell is umbilicate, the umbilicus very narrow within, but

oblong, contained between seven and eight times in the diameter 

 of the shell. Avellaneous in color, paler around the umbilicus and 

 slightly so on both sides of the chestnut-brown shoulder band. Sur-

 S. hachitana sculpture. 



Whorls 5, slowly widening, the last whorl very broad and capacious,, 

 rather strongly descending to the aperture. The aperture is very 

 large, obhque, the peristome well expanded except near the upper 

 termination; margins converging, joined by a thin callus. 



Alt. 15.7, diam. 28.4 mm.; umbiUcus 3.7 mm.; aperture 16.4 mm.

Cababi Mountains (about 75 miles west of Tucson), collected by 

 Frank Cole, March, 1915. Type No. 112,253, A. N. S. P., cotypes 

 in Ferriss collection. 



This is one of the largest species, very much resembling aS. ashmuni 

 Bartsch, from Richinbar, Yavapai Co., which has a slightly smaller 

 aperture. As the localities are several hundred miles apart and 

 separated by the depression of the Gila River, they will probably 

 turn out to be distinct when the genitalia of both are examined; 

 but as no differences which could reasonably be called specific appear 

 in a close comparison of the types, we rank the southern form as a 

 subspecies. 



The nine specimens collected measure 28.4, 27.9, 27.8, 25.5, 24.8, 

 24.6, 24.5, 24, 23.9 mm. diameter, being therefore variable in size. 



Sonorella ashmuni ambigua n. subsp. PL X, figs. 6, 6a, 66. 



The shell is smaher than S. a. capox (diameter 20.9 to 23.4 mm.) 

 with the last whorl widening somewhat less, the aperture more 

 rounded.

Cababi Mountains; No. 112,254 sent with the preceding, but 

 whether collected in the same place is not known. They were 

 taken in March, 1914, by Mr. Frank Cole, Mr. Ferriss' guide in 1913. 



Thirty-two specimens measure as follows in diameter: 20.9, 

 21 (2), 21.1, 21.3 (2), 21.4 (2), 21.5, 21.6 (2), 21.7 (2), 21.8, 22 (5), 

 22.2 (2), 22.3, 22.4, 22.5 (3), 22.6, 22.7, 23, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4. 



We are in some doubt about the status of this form, but it is 

 readily separable from S. a. capax in the series seen. The genitalia 

 when examined will no doubt clear up the uncertainty.

VI. The Baboquivari Mountains. 



We had not intended at first to visit the Baboquivaris. From 

 our camp, above 7,000 feet in the Santa Ritas, the long ridge, sixty 

 miles distant, bounded the western horizon. We could see the 

 wonderful obehsk of Baboquivari Peak catch the morning sun 

 while the great valley between slept in dusk. At evening it stood 

 silhouetted, velvet black, between the purple valley and flaming sky. 

 To visit this range, beyond which there is no water, became an 

 obsession, and finally we made the two-day journey by wagon, 

 camping midway on Sopori Creek, where there was a little stagnant 

 water for the horses. 



The Baboquivari Range is a single, long, north and south ridge with 

 numerous short lateral spurs. Its chief landmark, Baboquivari 

 Peak, is a huge obelisk of dull red rhyolite, standing on the main 

 axis of the range, flat topped, its sides practically vertical. The 

 foothills and lower slopes of the range have many barrel cacti, 

 opuntias, agaves, very few giant cacti. The lower courses of the 

 canyons are green with mesquite and cat-claw. The higher moun- 

 tains are grassy and lack large cacti; only a flat Mamillaria and the 

 little rainbow cactus were noticed. There is some scattering oak, 

 size of a peach tree, on western and northern slopes, and very few 

 stunted pinyons around the high crags. The herbaceous plants are 

 chiefly the same as in the Santa Ritas. Sycamore Canyon has a 

 richer sylva — buttonwood, walnut, hackberry, a fine dark-leaved 

 species of oak, etc. There is water in Oro Fino and Sycamore 

 Canyons, and we found some also near the head of Thomas Canyon, 

 about half a mile below the peak. Near the mouth of Sycamore 

 there was in 1910 a foresters' house (which we occupied), a corral 

 and a pump. Much further up there is running water. Our collect- 

 ing stations, enumerated below, are shown on the accompanying 

 sketch map.^ 



The following collecting stations were found: 



Station 21. Mt. Mildred, north side of the butte at summit of 

 the talus slope. 



5 We are indebted to Professor R. H. Forbes, of the University of Arizona, for 

 information correcting the names we had heard of the canyons. Sycamore 

 Canyon is also known as Brown's or Wasson and Brown's Canyon. Sabino 

 Otero has for many years ranged cattle in this canyon, and from this some persons 

 have called it Otero Canyon. We were also given the name Baboquivari Canyon 

 for Oro Fino Canyon. No topographic maj) has been published, so that hasty 

 note-book sketches made by one of us in course of a long day's tramp from Oro 

 Fino Canyon to the Peak and down to camp in Sycamore Canyon, have been 

 utilized to locate our type localities.

 roughness, stronger near the suture. In fresh young shells of 2|

 Type No. 111,554, A. N. S. P., topotypes in collections of Ferriss 

 and Daniels. Also on the north side of the highest peak of the 

 Qui-i-tomoc Hills, J. C. Blumer. 



This species is readily distinguished from S. haboquivariensis by 

 the wider umbilicus, smaller aperture, the shorter, steeper descent 

 •of the last whorl to the aperture, and the absence of distinct sculpture 

 on the embryonic whorl; also by the very different genitalia. 



By the small penis and slender, tapering penis-papilla, S. vespertina 

 is closely related to S. timiamocensis and S. eremita. In shell charac- 

 ters it comes very close to *S. sitiens, which differs by the form of its 

 penis-papilla. 



S. vespertina was found at our only collecting station west of the 

 summit of the range, but it occurred there in considerable abundance. 

 Over 100 living individuals and numerous "bones" were taken by 

 two of us in about three-quarters of an hour, in the course of our 

 tramp from camp in Oro Fino Canyon to the peak and down to camp 

 in Sycamore Canyon. 



The specimens taken in the Qui-i-tomoc Hills have not been dis- 

 sected, but we cannot distinguish the shells from the Baboquivari 

 vespertina. 



Sonorella baboquivariensis n. sp. PI. X, figs, l to 2b. 



The shell is very narrowly umbilicate, globose-depressed, thin, 

 glossy, cinnamon or sayal brown, fading or whitish around the 

 umbilicus and on both sides of the broad chestnut-brown shoulder 

 band. First third of a whorl smooth, the following whorl with. 

 sculpture of irregular radial wrinkles, over which run spiral, slowly 

 descending, irregular threads ; later whorls marked with fine growth 

 lines as usual. Whorls 4^, the last very wdde, its last fourth slowly 

 and rather deeply descending. The aperture is very large, strongly 

 oblique. Peristome narrowly expanding throughout, the columellar 

 margin brown-edged, broadly dilated and refiexed half over the um- 

 bilicus. The parietal callus has an opaque, pale browm edge.

enlarged, the rest slender. The basal third or less is sheathed, the 

 sheath composed of firm, circular muscles. The papilla (fig. 1, pp.) 

 is cylindric, with a conic, glancUform end. The retractor muscle is 

 inserted on the epiphallus, which is nearly as long as the penis, and 

 bears a short flagellum. The vagina is about three-fourths as long 

 as the penis. In two individuals the organs measure, in mm. : 



Baboquivari Mountains, the types No. 111,549, A. N. S. P., from 

 Station 25, in the head of Thomas Canyon about half a mile from 

 Baboquivari Peak. Also at Station 23, at the northern bases of 

 crags at summit of the spur which divides Thomas Canyon. In 

 Sycamore Canyon, at Station 26, in a slide on the ridge of the head 

 branch, about 300 feet or more below the summit; Station 27, about 

 1,000 feet lower, near bed of canyon; Station 28, still lower, and 

 Station 31, further down the canyon, low on the south side. 



In Oro Fino Canyon it was taken at Station 21, at the foot of the 

 cliffs on north side of Mount Mildred, a conspicuous butte at the 

 southern side of the mouth of the canyon; also Station 22, among 

 low crags near the north side of the canyon. 



This is the common species of the Baboquivaris throughout the 

 short section of the range which we explored. It is distinguished by 

 having a larger aperture than any other Sonorella known. The 

 rather long penis with a strong basal sheath and a papilla of very 

 peculiar and characteristic shape are diagnostic of the soft anatomy, 

 and confirmed in a number of individuals from several stations. 



All of the stations are on the eastern watershed of the range. The 

 only collecting station on the western slope (24) had a quite different 

 Sonorella, *S. vespertina. 



The size is smaller in Oro Fino Canyon. At Station 22 the shells 

 are decidedly more solid and more opaque than the types. Height 

 12, diam. 18 mm. to height 13, diam. 19.5 mm.; 4| whorls. Soft 

 anatomy is typical. 



Specimens from high on the ridge near the head of Sycamore Can- 

 yon, Station 26, are also rather small, diam. 18 to 19.3 mm. Near 

 the bottom of the canyon, at Station 27, the shells measure 19 to

THE DIVERSITY OF ECOLOGIC CONDITIONS AND ITS INFLITENCE ON THE 



RICHNESS OF FLORAS. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



The ecologic conditions of vegetation are those which are con- 

 nected with the influence of the environment on the plants. The 

 factors which influence the growth and the cUstribution of species 

 may be divided into Climatic, Edaphic, Physiographic, Biotic, and 

 Chronologic (Geologic-Historic). The climatic factors include the 

 influence of temperature, moisture, light and wind. The edaphic 

 factors are connected with the conditions of the soil. The physio- 

 graphic factors are concerned with the physical structure of the 

 geosphere (land surface) and the hydrosphere (water surface) of 

 our planet. The biotic factors are those in which plants and animals 

 (including man) are influential. The chronologic factors deal with 

 the past geologic and paleontologic conditions of the earth, while the 

 historic data are concerned chiefly with the past distribution of 

 plants and their probable successional history. The diversity of 

 ecologic conditions is the diverse character of the climate, soil, 

 physiography, life and chronology of any region. 



The richness of a flora may be considered from a number of different 

 points of view. We may consider it numerically, that is the actual 

 number of species ; or we may consider its richness in generic types, in 

 endemic types, in introduced plants, in common plants, in rare plants, 

 in relict species, in biologic forms (such as xerophytes, hydrophytes) 

 and in growth forms (trees, shrubs, lianes) or in the types suggested 

 first by Raunkiaer, namely, the phanerophytes, the chamsephytes, the 

 hemicryptophytes, the helophytes and the geophytes. If we use the 

 system of Raunkiaer and arrange the above types by percentages, 

 then we would have a climatic spectrum which would enable us to 

 make a comparison with the floras of other lands and climes simi- 

 larly arranged. An attempt will be made to study the diversity of 

 ecologic conditions and its influence on the richness of the floras of 

 a number of different phytogeographic regions of North America. 

 Those regions will be chosen with which the writer is more or less 

 familiar, and regions which have been studied carefully by other 

 botanists and their floras catalogued. 




420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



The regions of little physiographic diversity are the following: 

 Point Pelee, Ontario, jutting into Lake Erie, comprises that part of 

 Essex County at the western end of the lake, and in the enumeration 

 of its plants those found on Pelee Island are included. Point Pelee 

 is a triangular piece of land with its acute angle running about 

 ■9 miles south into Lake Erie. About nine-tenths of this tract is 

 mostly a very wet marsh between the east and west beaches. Within 

 this marsh limit are several ponds and small lakes, while on the east 

 and . west sides are narrow low, sandy beaches, the western one 

 backed by sand dunes. Outside the marsh the land is sandy. No 

 geographic configuration could be much more simple. C. K. Dodge^ 

 has found 466 genera and 623 species of ferns and seed plants on 

 Point Pelee. The generic coefficient, which is the proportion of 

 genera to species in a flora, is for the Point flora 74.7 per cent. 



The pine-barren region of New Jersey is a country of slight relief. 

 The soil is sandy, underlaid by gravel. The streams which flow into 

 the Atlantic Ocean have nowhere a rapid current, and their mouths 

 are influenced by tide water. The hills are low, the steeper ones 

 having gradual slopes. Natural lakes are small and widely scattered. 

 The lower drainage levels are occupied by marshes and swamps. 

 With this simple topography we find a numerically poor flora of 

 250 genera and 555 species of native plants, so that the generic 

 coefficient is 45 per cent. 



Hartsville, South Carolina, the flora of which has been investigated 

 by Coker,2 is found on the inner drier part of the Atlantic coastal 

 plain. Just north of the town proper is a rapid descent of about 

 50 feet into the valley of Black Creek. This vaUey with certain 

 irregularities extends approximately one-half mile and is terminated 

 on its northern edge by sand hills, which rise in gentle undulations. 

 The general surface configuration of the country south of Black 

 Creek Valley is that of a level plain with slight elevations and depres- 

 sions, some of the latter cut by the streams. The nature of the 

 vegetation on the level plain is de-termined very largely by the 

 position of the water surface in the soil. The flora, as enumerated 

 by Coker, includes 344 genera and 628 species of plants, which gives 

 us a rather higher generic coefficient of 54.6 per cent. 



The Altamaha Grit Region of Georgia, whose flora has been 

 investigated by Harper, has fairly uniform environmental conditions.

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



Harper^ finds that there are 404 genera and 797 species of plants, 

 giving, therefore, a generic coefficient of 50 per cent. 



Miami Florida, is situated on the oolitic limestone formation of 

 south Florida. •* The flat, featureless country is relieved by short 

 streams which drain the Everglades (of simple topography) into 

 the Atlantic Ocean. The sea beaches are of silicious sand. Small 

 enumerates 466 genera and 796 species in his Flora of Miami, and 

 the calculated generic coefficient is, therefore, 59 per cent. 



The Florida Keys^ are of even simpler configuration than the 

 adjoining mainland. There are no running streams and the lime- 

 stone soil is singularly porous. Besides, the islands are narrow and 

 their shores are rocky, of calcareous sands, or mud-fringed. The 

 entire number of genera is, according to Small, 346 and the number 

 of species is 533, giving the exceptionally high coefficient of 65 per 

 cent. 



Selecting a number of other localities, we find that the vegetation 

 of the upper Susquehanna*^ in New York and Pennsylvania is de- 

 veloped on a soil of glacial origin, in fact the whole region was glaci- 

 ated. Here there is a relatively rich flora of 462 genera and 1105 

 species of seed plants and ferns. The generic coefficient of the upper 

 Susquehanna flora, is, therefore, 41.8 per cent. 



Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is in a region of rich, agricultural 

 development, which has been dependent on the limestone soils, 

 suitable to the tobacco plant, which thrives upon such soils without 

 depleting seriously the natural mineral fertilizers. The county is 

 in the rolling Piedmont district where the hills are rounded, the 

 streams quiet and the topography comparatively simple and unmoun- 

 tainous with broad, fertile valleys between the ranges of hills. The 

 Susquehanna River runs along the western })oundary for about 

 forty miles and for over one-half of this distance it passes through a 

 canyon with steep sides and a southern exposure where plants of a 

 more southern distribution are at home. Sphagnum swamps among 

 the hills have a more northern flora. Shale and sandstones border 

 the northern part of the county, and south of the middle belt of 

 limestone, schistic rocks occur with some outcrops of serpentine.

SmalF enumerates 617 genera and 1464 species of Lancaster County 

 plants, SO that we have a generic coefficient of 42.1 per cent. 



As a general rule, the smaller the area of land, the more simple 

 and uniform the configuration of that country. There are of course 

 exceptions to this fact. Fortunately, we have two floras from which 

 we can draw conclusions. Daniels^ has studied the flora of Columbia, 

 Missouri, and vicinity and Mackenzie^ has enumerated the plants 

 of Jackson County, the same State. Columbia is in the tension belt 

 between forest and prairie. The prairie vegetation is that of Illinois 

 and Iowa; the forest vegetation is that of the Ozark Plateau of 

 Missouri and northern Arkansas. The bottoms of the Missouri 

 River bring hither the alluvial flora and in the ponds and marshes 

 occurs the hydrophytic flora of the eastern United States. Jackson 

 County is bounded on the north by the Missouri River. There are 

 river sand bars, high and rocky bluffs, and an uneven country 

 threaded by small rivers. Prairie country lies between the streams. 

 Barrens are found where the limestone rocks are covered by a thin 

 soil, with a bog region found along the Missouri bluffs west of Sibley. 

 Daniels lists 435 genera and 1058 species of plants about Columbia. 

 The generic coefficient is 41.1 per cent. Mackenzie enumerates 

 500 genera and 1141 species in the flora of Jackson County with a 

 calculated generic coefficient of 43.8 per cent. 



The Pacific coast flora also illustrates the same principle first 

 ■enunciated by Jaccard,^** that the generic coefficient is inversely 

 proportional to the diversity of the ecologic conditions. HalP^ has 

 written one of the best local floras extant. The Yosemite National 

 Park presents a great variety of conditions, but as compared with 

 the central Rocky Mountain region or the entire Sierra Nevada 

 chain its topography is less diversified. Here, however, we find 

 springs, creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes and glaciers with rocky outcrops, 

 gravelly ridges and steep precipices. The irregular topography 

 gives rise to southward-facing slopes which receive the full efifect 

 of the sun's rays, as well as northward slopes, where it is moist and 

 shady. The altitude ranges from 2500 feet to 13,090 feet along the 

 crest of the Sierra Nevada. If an enumeration is made of the

plants in Hall's Yosemite Flora, we get, omitting the grasses, 

 sedges, rushes and varietal forms, a total of 741 species and 311 genera 

 ^^^th a generic coefficient of 41.9 per cent. If the omissions are 

 supplied, Hall estimates that there would be not less than 1200 

 species in the park area of 1124 square miles. 



The selection of regions of greater physiographic diversity, than 

 those which we have discussed, brings out some interesting facts. 

 It shows that our study is a comparative one, as we have contrasted 

 areas such as Point Pelee and the Florida Keys with regions of 

 somewhat greater diversity, such as Jackson County, Missouri and 

 the Yosemite National Park, California. A greater contrast is seen 

 when we compare the Yosemite region of considerable diversifica- 

 tion of topography Avith regions of even greater natural environ- 

 mental conditions. 



The flora of the State of Connecticut,^- which has a great variety 

 of soils, slope exposures, river systems and tidal estuaries, includes 

 621 genera and 1942 species, so that the generic coefficient is 31.9 

 per cent. As a close approximation to this coefficient yielded by a 

 flora at about the same latitude and not far removed geographically, 

 we have the flora of the vicinity of New York. In his monograph, 

 Taylor^^ lists 830 genera and 2651 species of plants. The physi- 

 ography of the New York region includes salt marshes, estuaries, 

 sea beaches, large river systems, mountains, as the Catskills and 

 the Poconos, sandy country, as the pine-barrens of New Jersey, and 

 morainic deposits in Long Island and elsewhere. Hence we find 

 the percentage 31.3 per cent, to be an expression of that diversity. 



The flora of a great state like Pennsylvania,'^ with all kinds of 

 soils, river systems, lakes, bogs, mountain systems and plateaus, 

 might be expected to give a low generic coefficient, and we find on 

 counting that there are 680 genera and 2275 species of ferns and 

 seed plants, so that the coefficient is 29.8 per cent. 



Consulting the Flora of Tennessee, by Gattinger, published in 

 1901, we find that for that state, with a high and ancient system of 

 mountains in its eastern end, that there are 755 genera and 2218 

 species of plants, a considerable number less than in Pennsylvania, 

 and that the generic coefficient of the Tennessee flora is 34 per cent.

spermaphytes, in a region of great physiographic diversity comprises 

 822 genera and 2502 species, yielding a generic coefficient of 32.8 

 per cent. 



However, if we use Coulter and Nelson's New Manual of Botany 

 of the Central Rocky Mountains (1909), we find that 23.7 per 

 cent, is the generic coefficient for that region where the diversity of 

 land configuration is great and where the ecologic conditions present 

 striking differences. There are listed in this manual 649 genera 

 and 2733 species. 



The differences presented by the generic coefficients of different 

 countries is illustrated by reference to the Flora of the State of 

 Washington, by Charles V. Piper (1906), and by an enumeration 

 of the genera and species given in Jepson's Flora of Western Middle 

 California (1901). The first work gives 614 genera and 2279 species, 

 as the richness of the Washington flora, while Jepson's book includes 

 421 genera and 1449 species. The generic coefficient for the flora 

 of Washington was determined to be 26.9 per cent, and for that of 

 western middle California 29 per cent. 



In such regions as the Appalachian Mountains, which represent 

 an ancient upheaval, and are covered with a deciduous forest, which 

 has occupied the region since the Miocene, the chronologic factor 

 must be considered as one of the factors influencing the numerical 

 richness of the flora. This fact is also illustrated in California, 

 where the diversity of the coast flora in endemic types, as contrasted 

 with that of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, is linked intimately with 

 the past geologic history of the country. Although possessing many 

 species in common, the flora of the coast ranges of California Is 

 decidedly different from that of the Sierra Nevada. Jepson regards 

 the flora of the California coast ranges as a decidedly endemic one, 

 much older and more unique than that of the Sierra Nevada. An 

 examination of a list of plants peculiar to the coast ranges and 

 the Sierra Nevada will show that the coast ranges lack those northern 

 genera which we may call boreal-alpine, while the list of genera 

 found in the Sierra Nevada includes such boreal-alpine genera as 

 Bryanthus, Cassiope, Sibbaldia. This difference at once emphasizes 

 the fact, that to explain the floral diversity and the generic coefficient, 

 we must emphasize not only present conditions of physiography 

 as effective, but we must study the geologic history of the region as 

 \vell, as the past distribution and past successional phases of the 

 land and water plants. 



Before summarizing, it is important to give a few additional 




1915.] NATUKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 425 



comparative figures. Small includes in his Flora of the South- 

 eastern United States (1913), 6364 species and 1494 genera, giving 

 a generic coefficient of 23 per cent. The total number of genera 

 and species in Gray's ManuaP^ is 821 genera and 3413 species, or 

 24 per cent., for the British flora 734 genera and 2964 species, or 

 24 per cent., and for Switzerland 659 genera and 2453 species, or 

 27 per cent. 



If we place in sequence the numbers which we have given above, 

 it becomes evident that we can arrange our regions so that we dis- 

 cover that no two places are alike with respect to the diversity of 



the physiographic conditions.

The figures of this table are a partial confirmation of Jaccard'.s^ 

 law of plant distribution, applied for the first time to a statistic 

 .study of the American flora. It seems, therefore, ''that the generic 

 coefficient is inversely proportional to the diversity of ecologie 

 conditions." Such regions as the central, northeastern and south- 

 eastern United States, central Rocky Mountains, Great Britain, 

 and Switzerland have ecologie conditions of the greatest diversity, 

 and hence low generic coefficients, while the Pelee region, the Miami 

 region and that of the Florida Keys with fairly uniform physiography 

 have relatively high generic coefficients.

AN ARRANGEMENT OF MINERALS ACCORDING TO THEIR OCCURRENCE.^ 

 BY EDGAR T. WHERRY AND SAMUEL G. GORDON. 



In the preparation of a catalog of the minerals of Pennsylvania, 

 upon which the writers have been engaged for some time, a system- 

 atic plan for listing the minerals under each locality has proved 

 desirable. The standard classification, as used by Dana, being unsatis- 

 factory for this purpose, in that it is based on chemico-crystallographic 

 features, and represents a laboratory rather than a field system, 

 a new arrangement, based on occurrence and genetic relationships, 

 has been worked out. 



The principles applied require little discussion. The types of 

 mineral occurrence are classified on the basis of chemical and geo- 

 logical relations, the chief criterion for subdivision being dissimilarity 

 in mineral content. Thus, granite is not separated from syenite, 

 since both are made up of essentially the same minerals; but low- 

 alkali syenites are separated from those high in alkalies because 

 quite different minerals develop in the two. The various sub- 

 divisions are not sharply defined, but grade ijnto one another, so 

 that rather arbitrary lines must be drawn between them; for example, 

 certain types of veins, such as the tourmaliniferous copper veins, 

 might with equal right be classed with either pneumatolytic veins 

 or hydrothermal deposits, and their minerals are here arbitrarily 

 placed in the former class. However, every effort has been made 

 to minimize difficulties of this sort by making the subdivisions as 

 comprehensive as possible. In arranging the minerals in each 

 division, Dana's order has been more or less closely followed. 



Rather than coin new names for the several subdivisions of this 

 scheme of classification, we have employed terms in common use, 

 even though they are not altogether appropriate. Thus "hydro- 

 thermal" is used for mineral veins, as is customary with economic 

 geologists, although it is recognized that pegmatites and, for that 

 matter, even ig-neous rocks, have about as much right to this term, 

 since both water and heat contribute to their formation. The terms 

 silicic, alkalic, calcic, and magnesic for the chemical subdivisions are 

 intended to indicate only the prominence of the respective con-

 Academy, December 14, 1914.

stituents, and not to have a strict quantitative significance, although 

 in general the ''silicic" rocks contain more than 45% Si02, while 

 in the other three over 7.5% of the oxides to which the name of 

 each refers i& usually present. 



The classification has been extended to about 800 mineral species, 

 some rarf! minerals being necessarily omitted because of lack of 

 information as to their occurrence, although it is to be expected that 

 many additions to the lists will prove necessary as our knowledge of 

 mineral associations advances. 



Much of the data has been obtained from recent works, especiallj^ 

 those of Lindgren,- Emmons,^ and Rogers.*

new or little-known crane-flies from the united states and 

 canada: tipulid^, diptera. part 2. 



by charles p. alexander. 



Introduction. 



In the present paper, the author has undertaken a consideration 

 of the American crane-flies contained in the collections of the Boston 

 Society of Natural History and the Museum of Comparative Zoology 

 at Cambridge. These collections are of peculiar interest to the 

 student of crane-flies since they include the numerous types of 

 Johnson, Osten Sacken, and Loew, in addition to a considerable 

 amount of unclassified material. The paper has been divided into 

 two parts, the first being a designation of the single-type specimen 

 of the species of Tipula described by Loew, the second part a con- 

 tinuation of the first paper under this title. ^ I Avish to express my 

 deep appreciation to all of the persons who have kindly assisted me 

 in this study, most of whom are designated in various parts of the 

 paper. I am especially indebted to Mr. Charles W. Johnson and 

 to Mr. Samuel Henshaw for the great privilege of examining and 

 studying the invaluable collections in their custody. . 



Part 1. Designation of the Single-type (Lectotypic) Specimen 

 OF THE North American Species of Tipula described 



BY Hermann Loew. 



The North American crane-flies described by Hermann Loew 

 were included in a series of papers published between the years 

 1861 and 1872 under the general title of Diptera Americce septen- 

 trio7ialis indigence and appearing in the Berliner Entomologische 

 Zeitschrift. This remarkable series of articles was in ten parts or 

 centuries, each containing the description of a hundred species of 

 flies. The references will be merely to the "Century," with the 

 number of the species in the century and the original pagination. 

 The date of the five centuries in which the crane-flies were described 

 is as follows: 



1 Proceedings of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 

 October, 1914, pp. 579-606. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 459 



Century IV, vol. 7, Nos. 1-42; 1863. 

 Century V, vol. 8, Nos. 14-32; 1864. 

 Century VI, vol. 9, Nos. 2, 3; 1865. 

 Century VIII, vol. 13, No. 2; 1869. 

 Century X, vol. 16, Nos. 2, 3; 1872. 



All of the North American crane-flies described by Loew in this 

 series of articles belong to the subfamily Tipulince and include the 

 following genera: Ctenophora (1 species); Longurio (1 species); 

 Holonisia (1 species); Stygeropsis (3 species); Pachyrrhina (19 

 species) and Tipula (41 species). The Loew material is all cotypic, 

 there being no designation of a single-type specimen, and conse- 

 quently the choosing of a lectotype at this time is deemed advisable. 

 Concerning the Loew collection, as it is now preserved, it should be 

 understood that the type-series for any species very often includes 

 many specimens that were not mentioned by Loew in his original 

 description, and yet there can be no doubt but that the material 

 formed part of the type-series, since the specimens often bear the 

 written label in Loew's script and the text of certain of the descrip- 

 tions indicates that this material was before the author at the time 

 that the description was drawn up. It has often seemed advisable 

 to select one of these latter specimens as type, but this has not been 

 done unless the actual specimen mentioned by Loew could not be 

 located, as in the case of Tipula angulata. In all cases the male sex 

 has been given preference over the female because of the varied 

 characters of the hypopygium of this sex. Specimens that were 

 placed in the series by Osten Sacken at the time that he arranged 

 the material in the museum, but from the place and date were 

 obviously not in Loew's hands at the time of the drawing up of the 

 descriptions, have been ignored. It may be stated that the material 

 in the Museum of Comparative Zoologj', as regards the species of 

 Tipula, is still largely unarranged except to the major divisions 

 based on the wing-pattern, there being three large cases devoted 

 to the striatce, marmoratce and suhunicolores. When one studies the 

 descriptions of the Tipulce described by Loew it is at once noted that 

 only about six of the forty or more characterized are of the sub- 

 unicolores, and this was explained when the collection was studied. 

 The majority of the species described as new in the present paper, 

 as well as most of the Eastern species named by Doane in 1901, were 

 found in the collection, bearing manuscript names in Loew's writing 

 but for some unexplained reason having never been described. In 

 cases where this was feasible the name suggested by Loew is the 




460 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



one that has been adopted. These manuscript names of Loew 

 have appeared in various collections, or, in some cases (bicornis, 

 brevicollis), even into the literature, and consequently it is deemed 

 advisable to mention the name applied by Loew to the different 

 species discussed in the second part of this paper. 



TIPULA. 



T. angulata, Century V, No. 22, pp. 61, 62. 



The type-material was stated to have come from Massachusetts, 

 but the only specimen now appearing in the collection is a male 

 from New Hampshire, bearing the number 258, with the name-label 

 in Loew's writing. It is this specimen that is designated as the type ; 

 there is a possibility that the locality labels were later confused or 

 that Loew wrote down the wrong State in his original description. 

 There is no reason whatsoever for doubting that the specimen was 

 before Loew at the time he drew up the description. The paler 

 specimen mentioned in a note by Loew is not of this species, but of 

 T. penobscot, described later; the sex is not female, but male.

NEPHROTOMA Meigen. 



Pales Meigen; Xouvelle Classification des Mouches, p. 14; 1800 (nomen

 Pachyrrhiiia Macquart; Histoire Xaturelle des Insectes; Dipteres I, p. 88; 



1834. 



The genus Nephrotoma was erected by Meigen in 1803 to include 

 the Fabrician species, dorsalis. The insect mentioned, specimens 

 of which are before me (Urdingen, Niederrhein, Germany; Riedel, 

 collector), is a typical Pachyrrhina of the same group as eucera Loew 

 (Nearctic). The venational details and the characters of the male 

 hypopygium are altogether of the nature of those occurring in Pachyr- 

 rhina. Loew, in a foot-note to the characterization of eucera {Ber- 

 liner Entomologische Zeitschrift, VH, Century 4, p. 297; 1863) states 

 that if Nephrotoma is to be separated from Pachyrrhina, eucera 

 should be referred to Nephrotoma. The antennae of eucera and dorsalis 

 are 19-segmented in the male; of polymera, 16-segmented in the 

 male; of the majority of the species of the genus, 13-segmented in 

 the male. Thus we see there is a very considerable range in the 

 number of antennal segments, but the species included are all so 

 very similar in the details of venation, in the male hypopygia and in 

 their general habitus and body-coloration that they should not be 

 separated, especially since the females show a very much lesser 

 range in the number of antennal segments (13 to 15). A considerable 




466 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



variation in the number of antennal segments is found in other 

 genera of crane-flies (Ctedonia, 15 to 24 segments; Cerozodia, 32 to 

 39 segments; Tanyderus, 17 to 25 segments), and consequently too 

 much significance should not be placed upon this variable character 

 in these groups. 



The genus Puchyrrhina was described at a much later date, and 

 consequently the numerous species known throughout the world 

 under this name must be referred to Nephrotoma. The change in 

 the American species affects all of the described forms with the excep- 

 tion of collaris Say, polymera Loew, nohilis Loew, unimaculata Loew, 

 calif ornica Doane, trinidadensis Alexander and macrostema Alexander, 

 which should be referred to the genus Tipula as discussed below. 



The discover}^ of an ultimate character to separate the species of 

 Nephrotoma from those of Tipida is still largely a desideratum. 

 There are a number of characters which, if used in combination, 

 should serve to separate the species of the two genera. The majority 

 of the characters cited below should hold in all cases. Venationally 

 these characters are as follows: 



(1) The very short, usually almost transverse, radial sector of 

 Nephrotoma, which in many species is transverse and simulates a 

 cross-vein; in other species longer and more ol)lique, reaching its 

 maximum length apparently in species such as vittula Loew. 



(2) The sessile cell Mi in Nephrotoma, this being rarely short- 

 petiolate. This character has long been known, having been clearly 

 stated by Schiner (1864). Species of Tipula with the cell sessile 

 are unknown. 



(3) The basal deflection of Cui and the cross-vein m-cu at or 

 before the fork of M. This character, described for the first time by 

 Czizek- and independently by Brunetti,^ is the nearest approach 

 to absolute of any that we have, but even this is approached by 

 some species of Tipula (the jnarmoraice group, fragilis Loew, ignohilis 

 Loew, et al.). 



The male hypopygium of Nephrotoma shows the ninth pleurite 

 never completely fused with the ninth sternite, the more generalized 

 condition occurring in such species as incurva Loew, where the 

 pleurite is almost entirely separated from the sternite, through 

 lugens Loew, where the pleural suture is straight and not curved 

 dorsally toward the tip, to the more specialized condition with the

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 467 



curved suture obtaining in many species {eucera Loew, ferruginea 

 Fabricius, pedunculata Loew, et al.). The ninth tergite is usually 

 small and rather inconspicuous, not tumid. The outer pleural 

 appendage is fleshy, in the shape of a more or less flattened lobe, 

 which is Sometimes attenuated or arcuated. 



In general, the species of Nephfotoma are shiny with well-marked 

 stripes and bright colors. In some, however (as macrocera Say), 

 the colors are dull, quite as in some species of Tipula. The six 

 species listed before, as well as the new species described below as 

 Tipula pachyrhinoides, which have hitherto been taken to be species 

 of Nephrotoma, agree with the species of this latter genus only in 

 the bright, shiny coloration, all of the other characters pointing 

 strongly to the fact that they are really species of Tipula. The 

 second Tipida calif ornica described by Doane^ thus requires renaming. 



In the work by Czizek cited before,^ the author of this excellent 

 paper has given a critical comparison of Nephrotoma and Pachyrrhina, 

 pointing out the fact that there is no basis at all for retaining the 

 latter name; but in spite of this clear comparison, the two names 

 are still kept separate. The "discoidal cross-vein^' spoken of by the 

 author is that portion of the vein M between the cross-vein m-cu 

 and the fork of M.

This small Tipula bears a remarkable resemblance to certain 

 species of Nephrotoma, especially N. vittiila Loew, which is likewise 

 a northern form. The thoracic stripes in vittula are described as 

 being black, but specimens in the collection of the Boston Society 

 of Natural History have the stripes rich reddish chestnut and are 

 very similar to the present fly; the broad yellowish white median 

 thoracic stripe, the transverse caudal brown margins to the abdominal 

 tergites and the venation will easily distinguish the forms.

 of the segment. Front with a small tubercle; head light gray with 

 a very narrow brown line extending from the middle of the tubercle 

 caudad to the occiput. 



Thoracic dorsum light gray with rather indistinct brown stripes, 

 the median stripe broader in front, narrowed behind, indistinctly 

 split by a pale middle vitta; lateral stripes narrower and less dis- 

 tinct; scutum pale grayish white, the middle portions of the lobes

 the cord; a brown cloud at the origin of Rs, at the arculus, at two- 

 thirds the length of cell M. Venation (see Plate XVI, fig. 4) : tip 

 of R2 atrophied. 



Abdominal tergites dull yellow with a median brown longitudinal 

 line on the first segment; remaining tergites yello^vish brown^

 a blunt, rounded lobe on either side of this concavity, a sharp median 

 tooth and a smaller denticle midway between the median toothy 

 and the rounded lobe. Ninth pleurite rather small, complete, the 

 dorso-caudal margin produced into a sharp point which is directed 

 caudad; the ventro-caudal portion rounded and provided \vith 

 abundant rather long hairs; pleural appendages two, the outer 

 appendage a slender, small, fleshy lobe, subsigmoid to cylindrical 

 in shape; the inner pleural lobe is complex, consisting of a large, 

 flattened portion which is produced in front into a moderately sharp 

 point which is directed cephalad; underneath the base of this point, 

 on the anterior or cephalic margin is a black, chitinized lobe which 

 is directed laterad; the base of this appendage is hollowed out into 

 a conspicuous cup-shaped lobe which is directed laterad and bears 

 a small, sharp spine behind and beneath.

 being coniferous trees, Abies, Picea, Tsuga and Thuja and the ground 

 cover of Coptis trifolia, Linncea boreaUs americana, etc. The insect 

 occurred along a small stream flowing through rather low ground 

 and supporting a very "rich crane-fly fauna. Most of the species 

 were swept from boughs of trees, fern growth, etc., or caught in 

 flight or swarming. The more conspicuous species on this day were 

 Dicranomyia pudica, D. Jucretica, D. halterata, D. pubipennis, Lim- 

 nobia solitaria, Rhypholophus 7neigeni, in small swarms, R. rubellus, 

 in very large swarms, Erioptera venusta, E. vespertina, Gonomyia 

 subcinerea, Epiphragma fasciapennis, Limnophila rufibasis, L. brevi- 

 furca, L. fuscovaria, L. quadrata, Adelphomijia minuta, Rhaphidolabis 

 flaveola, Tricyphona calcar, T. inconstans, Liogma nodicornis, Doli- 

 chopeza americana, Nephrotoma macrocera, Tipula bella and Tipula 

 (Trichotipula) oropezoides.

The synonomy as given above was decided upon after comparing 

 the description of decora with the type of angulata. In the collection 

 of Mr. Johnson there is a specimen of angtdata that is from the same 

 locality and taken by the same collector as the type of decora (male,

The type of this beautiful fly was taken on the shaded eastern 

 slopes of Buell Mt., one of the southern peaks of the Adirondacks. 

 It occurred in the hardwood forest which clothes the mountain, in 

 the neighborhood of small granitic cliffs and near the dried-up bed 

 of a mountain torrent. Crane-flies which were flying with this 

 species included Limnohia cinctij)es, L. indigena, Limnophila munda, 

 L. areolata, L. toxoneura, Tipula pallida, T. valida and both sexes of 

 T. fuliginosa. 



The paratype No. 104 was taken in the great gorge of the Taughan- 

 nock Falls near Cayuga Lake, N. Y. The insect occurred at the summit 

 of the talus slopes in a place wet with the falling spray of small 

 accessory streams; the more notable plants in this portion of the 

 gorge and growing at the top of the shale at this season are Pinguicula 

 vulgaris, Primida mistassinica and Saxifraga aizoides.

Perhaps the most striking result of the study of American crane- 

 flies during the past few years has been the discovery that the Tipula 

 speciosa Loew is the male sex of fuliginosa Say. The evidence that 

 this is the case has been slow in accumulating, but is now so con- 




480 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



elusive that the condition can be stated definitely at this time. 

 The males (speciosa) are very light colored, yellowish; the females 

 (fuliginosa) are dark brownish to almost black. This is the first case 

 of dimorphism in the Tipulidse that has come to my notice, but the 

 related species, jejuna Johnson and taughannock sp. n., certainly 

 belong here. 



This evidence of dimorphism in the species that is before me is as 

 follows: a male and a female, taken in copulation, collected at Ira, 

 Summit Co., Ohio, by James S. Hine. A male and a female secured 

 in copulation and actually pinned while still "in coitu, " collected 

 at light, Boston, Mass., June 1, 1914, by H. M. Parshley. The 

 final evidence is the finding of two crane-fly pupae in the debris 

 beneath the nest of a turkey vulture, on Jacksons Island, Md., 

 May 23, 1913, by Messrs. Barber and Shannon. The material 

 was taken to the laboratory, and both specimens emerged on May 23, 

 1913, one a male speciosa, the other a hmiale fuliginosa! 



On June 13, 1914, on Buell Mt., Fulton Co., N. Y., the males of 

 this fly were common on the mountain side in the open shady woods. 

 One female was taken. The males were usually found flying up a 

 tree-trunk, beginning low down near the base of the tree, ascending 

 by a partly flying, partly climbing motion. They were undoubtedly 

 searching for the retiring females, as has been observed in other 

 woodland-inhabiting species, as fragilis and others.

The insect was common on June 5, 1913, in a woody tract along 

 the Stillwater Bayou, Orono, Me., where it occurred with Dicranomyia 

 liberta, Erioptera caloptera, E. armata, and Tipula hella. 



The fly was reared from a large aquatic larva found in the Indian 

 Spring near Ithaca, Cayuga Lake, N. Y., where it occurred in the 

 beds of water-cress (Radicula nasturtiimi-aquaticum) in company of 

 other Tipulid larvse, such as Pedicia alhovitta, LimnophUa quadrata, 

 Tipula ahdominalis and T. hella, as well as a host of the usual aquatic 

 organisms. Other larvse of this species, likewise strictly aquatic, 

 were found in Coy Glen, Ithaca, N. Y., a rapid-flowing gorge stream.

The specific name is that of a Siouan tribe of Indians of the 

 Northwest. 



The only species with which this fly might be identified is Tipula 

 alta Doane (Annals of the Entomological Society of America, V, 44, 

 1912) from Wyoming. There are many discrepancies between the 

 descriptions of the two flies which lead me to believe that the present 

 form is a distinct insect; the head is not brown, but gray, with a 

 narrow brown median stripe; the lateral prsescutal stripes are 

 indistinct; the wings show a distinct vitreous spot beyond the stigma; 

 the size is larger and the cell 1st Mo is not open (this open cell 1st M^ 

 in alta is almost surely an abnormality of the type); the details 

 of the genitalia are not as described for alta — the ninth pleurite is 

 produced into a long spatulate point, the first appendage is an 

 elongate, cylindrical, fleshy lobe, not small and spatulate; the 

 inner appendage not at all as described for alia.

 with the lower or caudal arm flattened, expanded at the apex, pale 

 in color and directed almost dorsad; the surface of the arm is rough- 

 ened, hairy; the upper or cephalic arm is flattened, chitinized. 

 Ninth sternite with the caudal margin very gently concave medially, 

 the caudo-lateral angles produced into rounded knobs which are 

 produced into lobes on the ventral inner face, the lobes covered

T. dietziana is respectfullj- dedicated to Dr. William G. Dietz. 



The species is closely allied to T. australis Doane and may be 

 separated from that species by means of the following key: 



1. Antennae short, the flagellar segments deeply constricted beyond 

 the basal enlargement; six bro^vn stripes on the mesonotal 

 prsescutum; male hypopygium with the ninth tergite almost 

 straight across the caudal margin with a deep and narrow 

 impressed median furrow; ninth pleurite distinctly complete; 

 lobes of the caudo-lateral angles of the ninth sternite, pendu- 

 lous, directed ventrad, the apex clothed Avith short golden 

 hairs; eighth sternite with four conspicuous lobes, the outer 

 pair very broad and flattened, their apex oblique; the inner 

 pair of lobes are the divaricate ends of a median process on the 

 caudal margin of the sternite, their apices clothed Avith a 

 dense brush of golden yellow hair australis Doane.^

 delphia, vol. 3, p. 23 (1823). 

 Tipula casta Loew; Entomologische Zeitschrift, vol. 7, p. 289 (1863). 

 Tipula infuscata Loew; Entomologische Zeitschrift, vol. 7, p. 289 (1863). 



There can be no doubt but that the three names given above 

 represent one and the same species. Under the series of cunctans 

 determined as such by Loew, there appears a specimen which bears 

 a manuscript label in Loew's writing and this label is ''infuscata." 

 The type-series of casta and infuscata, as well as the series of cunctans, 

 all bear the same manuscript number given to the specimens by 

 Osten Sacken (No. 95). In the series of Tipula cunctans there are 

 two females dated October 20; it is well known that infuscata is one 

 of the few autumnal species of Nearctic Tipula, and this data in 

 regard to cunctans only confirms the synonomy of the species. 



The Bicornis Group. 



The small group of species that constitute this division seem to 

 show the following characters and tendencies: The nasus is very 

 short to indistinct; the coloration is yellow or brownish yellow 

 with the thoracic stripes usually distinct; the body is provided with 

 abundant short hairs on the head and on the thoracic interspaces. 

 The venation shows the cell 1st Mo very small and pentagonal (larger 

 and more elongated in johnsoniana) . The male hypopygium has 

 the ninth tergite tumid (very slightly so in parshleyi), unarmed or 

 provided with horns (unarmed in johnsoniana; two horns in bicornis 

 and morrisoni; four horns in rnegaura); the ninth pleurite com- 

 plete; the outer pleural appendage tending to be reduced to a 

 very tiny lobe; the inner pleural appendage large, elongate to 

 subquadrate; the gonapophyses subtending the penis-guard, and 

 about half its length (in morrisoni, megaura, etc.) to fully the length 

 of the penis-guard (in johnsoniana) . The female ovipositor with the 

 valves short, blimt and subfleshy, little chitinized. Our species 

 may be separated in the male sex by the following key : 



1. Ninth tergite not tumid; eighth sternite very long, sheathing the 

 ninth sternite beneath, the tip with two chitinized points on 

 each side parshleyi sp. n.

 to the ninth sternite for the entire length of the latter, the

2. Ninth tergite with four lobes or horns megaura Doane.^ 



Ninth tergite with two or no horns 3 



3. No horns on the tergite johnsoniana sp. n.

4. The horns on the tergite directed upward bicornis Forbes.^" 



The horns on the tergite directed caudad or slightly ventrad, 



morrisoni sp. n. 



The Palsearctic Tipida fascipennis Meigen (1818) was the first 

 described species of this group and should probably give the name 

 to the group. The Nearctic groups of the genus should be correlated 

 with the Palaearctic species. 

 Tipula jolmsoiiiana .sp. n. 



Coloration light yellow, the thoracic stripes grayish brown; 

 antennal flagellum uniformly brown; male hypopygium with the 

 ninth tergite tumid without processes; ninth pleurite produced 

 into a broad flattened process.

Frontal prolongation of the head rather short, with numerous 

 short black hairs on the dorsal and lateral surfaces; nasus indis- 

 tinct. Palpi light brown. Antennge rather long, much longer than 

 in the related bicornis Forbes; the flagellar segments are slightly 

 swollen basally; the scapal segments and the basal half to two-thirds 

 of the third segment dull yellow, the remainder of the appendage 

 dark brown. Head rich brownish yellow with abundant short 

 black hairs scattered over the dorsal surface. 



Pronotal scutum yellowish brown with an indistinct brownish 

 spot on the side of the sclerite. Mesonotal prsescutum light yellow 

 with three grayish bro^\^l stripes, of which the median one is broadest 

 and longest; the interspaces between the stripes are provided with 

 numerous long yello^vish hairs; scutum, scutellum and postnotum 

 dull brownish yellow. Pleura pale yellow, thickly whitish poUinose; 

 trochanters dull yellow; femora yellow with the apex narrowly dark 

 bro"s\Ti; tibiae browm, the apex obscurely darker; tarsi brown. Wings 

 with a slight grayish tinge, more yellowish in the costal region and 

 in cell M adjoining vein Cn; stigma dark browm; a conspicuous

 silvery; ninth pleurite and sternite dark brown. Male hypopygium 

 (see Plate XVIII, fig. 40) with the ninth tergite (see Plate XIX, 

 fig. 58) tumid, though not very high, the caudal margin almost 

 transverse with an indistinct median impression; no horns or lobes 

 on the tergite; the ventro-caudal margin on either side of the middle 

 line is produced into a flattened edge whose ipner angle is blackened, 

 chitinized, and sparsely denticulate. Ninth pleurite complete, 

 extensive; the caudal margin is produced into a broad, flattened 

 process directed caudad and slightly dorsad and entad; outer pleural 

 appendage small but prominent for this group, of species, elongate-, 

 cylindrical, pale with a few scattered long hairs; inner pleural 

 appendage a flattened blade which is broad basally, narrowed into 

 a subacute point, the caudal margin ciliate with long yellow hairs. 

 Ninth sternite extensive, the dorso-caudal angle produced entad 

 and slightly ventrad; this process subacute and slightly chitinized; 

 beneath this a shorter lobe with a fringe of long yellow hairs, those 

 at the distal end curled and twisted. The gonapophyses are very 

 long, subequal to the penis-guard which they subtend; the tips of 

 the gonapophyses slightly divaricate, the distal two-thirds with a 

 fringe of stout yellow hairs on the ventral face. Eighth sternite

 barely indicated on segment one, extending the entire length of 

 segment two, on segments three and four broadening out to include 

 most of the dorsum; segments five to eight with the median mark 

 again narrowed; segments margined with silvery, this mark broad 

 laterally, very narrow caudally; the sternites pale. Male genitalia 

 (see Plate XVIII, fig. 41) with the eighth tergite very narrow.

lobes to the middle line beneath; the ventro-caudal edge of the 

 ninth tergite is concave and with an oval notch, the lobes thus 

 formed (see Plate XXI, fig. 83) directed entad, ventrad and slightly 

 caudad, heavily chitinized, minutely denticulate and provided with 

 a few long hairs. Ninth pleurite complete, rather large, subquadrate, 

 the dorso-caudal angle produced caudad and slightly dorsad and 

 entad; lobes two, flattened, fleshy, with numerous long hairs. Ninth 

 sternite rather restricted, the caudal margin beneath broadly con- 

 cave, the lateral lobes prominent, directed entad and caudad, the tips 

 expanded, truncate, the lobe with numerous long pale hairs on the 

 inner margin; immediately dorsad of this lobe is a small rounded 

 knob bearing numerous hairs; in a position of rest this knob is 

 invisible from beneath. Gonapophyses powerful (see Plate XXI, 

 fig. 82) directed caudad and slightly dorsad; they occupy the ventral 

 portion of the genital chamber, each one consisting of a cylindrical, 

 heavily chitinized horn, slightly divergent apically; a narrow line 

 of short strigose hairs on the outer face of each horn. Eighth sternite 

 large, the caudal margin truncated medially and here with a dense 

 brush of long pale hairs. 



The female is in the Loew collection and bears the label in Osten 

 Sacken's writing: authentic 9, caught with the cf, from Delaware. 

 The female is quite small, the wing measuring but 15 mm. The 

 abdomen of the allotype is broken off, but another specimen comes 

 close to bicornis in the very short valves to the ovipositor.

FISHES FEOM EASTERN CANADA. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Within the past few years the Academy has received several 

 collections from different localities in the eastern and maritime 

 provinces of the Dominion. They have been submitted to me for 

 study, and as several interesting or new records were found among 

 them, this paper is offered as a slight contribution to science. 

 Acknowledgment is here expressed to those who made the collec- 

 tions, and also for such field notes as are appended. 



Lake Cassette. 



This is one of the Rimouski series of lakes in Rimouski County, 

 Province of Quebec. Another connected lake is Long Lake, in the 

 same region. From these waters a number of fresh chars were 

 obtained by Mr. J. E. V. Titus, in September of 1911 and 1912. 

 Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchlll). 



Two rather well-marked varieties occur, which were thought to 

 be distinct by the fishermen, distinguished locally as the "brook 

 trout" and the "gray back." 



The first of these is of variable color, from very dark to quite 

 light or tan, or even pale brown. Dark examples are quite 

 olivaceous. Red on lower sides ordinarily of deep crimson. In 

 weight they range from one-half to six pounds and four ounces. 

 They are said to spawn in late October, or from late September till 

 late October. Li Touradiff Lake examples occur all quite black on 

 the back, in fact dusky-olive, and with the red of the lower sides 

 swarthy. Possibly this is due to the numerous submerged conifers, 

 besides other timber in the lake, which renders the water and the 

 fish dark. 



The gray-back is distinguished by the alleged variety of its steel- 

 gray color, the blotches and markings appearing very distinct. It 

 does not show red on its lower sides. The old females are known 

 as "bull-dogs," on account of their snub-noses. It reaches a length 

 of eight to eighteen inches, a weight of about three and one-half 

 pounds, and spawns later than the ordinary trout, or in October 

 and November. 




516 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Three examples before me from Lake Cassette do not indicate 

 these variations to be other than local or individual. 

 Salvelinus alpinus marstoni (Garman). 



Head 4 to 4f ; depth 4| to 6; D. usually iv, 9, i, rarely iv, 10, 

 I or IV, 8, i; A. usually iv, 8, i, sometimes iv, 9, i; scales in lateral 

 line with tubes about 106 to 123 to caudal base, and 3 to 10 more 

 on latter, the average about 7; 150 to 187 scales counted just above 

 L 1. its entire course to caudal base, and 5 to 12 more on latter; 

 32 to 34 scales above 1. 1. to dorsal origin; 30 to 34 scales below 1. 1. 

 to ventral origin; 68 to 73 predorsal scales; snout 3y to 3f in head, 

 measured from upper jaw tip; eye 6 to 7^; maxillary ly^^ to 2|; 

 interorbital 3| to 3J; gill-rakers of left side usually 8, seldom 7 + 12, 

 of right side usually 8, seldom 9 -|- 12, rarely 13; total length 12| 

 to 14f inches, of seven examples. 



Color when fresh, back deep olive to dusky, the latter shade mostly 

 over median line and color becoming more rich olive as it descends 

 the sides. Sides, in region of lateral line, marked by well-spaced 

 small red spots ocellated with very pale blue, though these last only 

 present when fish is taken from the water. Head dusky to olive 

 above, sides same, and lower surface whitish, with smutty tinge over 

 branchiostegals. Iris brownish or dusky, with narrow circle of 

 golden about dark pupil. Inside gill-openings pale. Dorsal and 

 caudal dusky-olive, with dusky shades on membranes of former. 

 Pectoral with whitish upper edge, on outer surface grayish medianly 

 above and lower surface orange-red, and on inner surface dark upper 

 median tint dusky-olive. Ventral orange-red, front and hind edges 

 whitish. Anal with front edge whitish, broad distal edge pale 

 orange and base pale dusky. Breast, belly, abdomen, and most all 

 of ventral region orange-red, though much paler posteriorly. 



When first studied I was inclined to consider these specimens as 

 a new form of char allied to the Salmo rnarstoni Garman. The points 

 of difference according to the original description are the very small 

 scales, about 230 in the series immediately above the lateral line,, 

 and more than 250 in a row 5 or 6 scales above this. The eye is 

 given as less than 5 in the head, the maxillary extending backward 

 almost as far as hinder edge of eye, and the gill-rakers 8 -{- 14. 

 From the above it is therefore quite likely these characters are really 

 individual variations. The spots of red along the lateral line are 

 imperfectly made out and their colors not sufficiently detailed in 

 the original description of Salmo marstoni Garman.^ Under the 



' Science, July 14, 1893, p. 23. Lac de Marbre, Ottawa County, Quebec.

vernaculars "Marston trout" and "Red Canadian trout," and 

 listed as Salvelinus marstoni, Evermann and Goldsborough give^ 

 a list of localities for the Quebec and Ottawa provinces, including 

 I^ake Cassette among their records. 



According to Mr. Titus, the present form is known as the "Golden 

 trout" or "Poisson d'Oro," from its coloration. The males always 

 exhibit orange-red sides and the female appears to have a more 

 yellowish tinge. The largest examples were about 1| pounds in 

 weight, and the dimensions of the largest noted above. They 

 spaw^i in late November and during December, in this locality. 

 All the trout of these lakes were spawning on the same grounds. 

 They do not appear to be common, and are taken in proportion of 

 one to every 1*50 or 200 brook trout. 



Nova Scotia. 



During the summer of 1911 Dr. D. G. Metheny made a collection 

 of marine fishes at Cranberry Head. He also made a similar

THE FISHES OF TRINIDAD, GRENADA, AND ST. LUCIA, BRITISH 



WEST INDIES. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In February and March of 1915 Mr. Richard M. Abbott visited 

 various of the Lesser Antilles, and while at the above-named islands 

 made several collections of fishes. Through his generosity, these 

 have all been received as gifts to the museum of the Academy. 



Trinidad. 



The collection from this island is the most extensive. It was 

 made chiefly in the fish-market of Port-of-Spain, from February 27 

 to March 7. The market fishes are all taken in the Gulf of Paria, 

 brought to town, and there disposed of as food. The waters of the 

 Gulf of Paria are continually discolored, so that they have a muddy 

 color. This has been explained as due to the vast quantities of 

 river deposits, silt, etc., carried down the Orinoco and through its 

 delta out into the sea. The shore currents then carry the soiled 

 and less saline waters north into the more or less enclosed gulf, 

 where they apparently are unable to clear. Apparently continuously 

 muddied, the water supports a rich fish-fauna. A few of the larger 

 species were seen in the market, and though carefully noted, were 

 not preserved. They are included below with this reservation. 



No account of the marine fishes of Trinidad has ever appeared. 

 The records of the few species known from the island occur princi- 

 pally as scattered references to material in the British Museum. 

 These will be found in the catalogues by the late Dr. Albert Giinther,^ 

 and in the second edition by Dr. G. A. Boulenger.- Dr. Giinther 

 also described several cyprinodonts in 1868,^ and al)out the same 

 time Hill has some notes. ^ More recently Dr. Barton A. Bean 

 described a flounder from Port-of-Spain.^ 



The first work on the fresh-water fishes was contributed by the 

 late Dr. Theodore Gill in 1858.^ Subsequently it was the subject

of critical notes by the late Dr. Liitken.'^ Recently a very interesting 

 and valuable account appeared by Dr. C. Tate-Regan, based chiefly 

 on the collection, notes, and sketches of Mr. Lechmere Guppj^, Jr.* 



In the present paper a list of all the fishes now known from the 

 island is given. Where species are represented in the collections of 

 the Academy, they are mentioned with the number of specimens 

 and their dimensions. The references pertain to the few species 

 previously known from Trinidad. While likely most of the fresh- 

 water species have been discovered, further collecting of the marine 

 forms will undoubtedly j'ield many others. Possibly seven or more 

 times as many as here listed, if not most of those comprising the 

 vast West Indian fauna, will eventuallj^ be found. 



GinglymostORia cirratum (Bonnateire). "Nurse." 



One seen, about seven feet in length. Like all the sharks, valued 

 as food. 



Mustelus canis (Mitchill). 



Two young, 9| and 10 inches long, with eight others not preserved, 

 taken from a female 45 inches long. 



Galeocerdo arcticus (Faber). 



One in the market, about four feet long. 



Eulamia oxyrhinchus (Mailer and Henle). 



One seen in the market contained four young, each of which 

 about 14 inches long. They were attached to the mother by a 

 placenta. 



Sphyrna tiburo (Linn»us). 

 One in the market about three feet long. 



Sphyrna zygaena (Linnffius). 



Number of examples, moderate in size, were seen in the market.

Only the above example was obtained. I first thought this must 

 be Stole phorus surinamensis Bleeker,^ a species formerly wrongly 

 identified by most writers with Engraulis clupeoides Swainson. It 

 differs, however, from Bleeker's species in several respects, and 

 therefore for the present it may be regarded as distinct. Bleeker's 

 examples were 96 mm. long, and are described with the scales as 

 35, the fins yellowish and the caudal broadly edged brownish behind.

 saliens has a different physiognomy, less attenuate or with the 

 profile of the lower jaw much more convex. The snout about equals 

 the eye, or longer, in the preceding species, whereas in the present 

 it is a little shorter than the eye. The maxillary extends further 

 back or a little behind the hind eye edge, the suborbital though 

 l)road covers less of the cheek, and the anal is inserted distinctly 

 l^efore the soft dorsal, while in 0. saurus it is inserted opposite. 

 Dorsal and caudal largely edged with dusky. My example agrees 

 in all respects with an example from Rio Janeiro.

 longer than snout; maxillary extends slightly beyond hind eye 

 edge. Iris dark reddish. Edges of dorsal, caudal and anal very 

 narrowly whitish, submarginal region blackish. One example 5f 

 inches long. 



This species is acknowledged to be distinct from R. sajwnaceus on 

 account of its larger eye, longer than snout. As I have no cor- 

 responding small examples of R. saponaceus, these points cannot be 

 verified. Boulenger says the snout and eye are equal in R. arenatus, 

 though in my example the eye is distinctly larger. Jordan and Rutter 

 have mentioned several examples from Jamaica,^^ and state "one has 

 three opercular spines" and "aside from the number of opercular 

 spines, this species may be distinguished from the preceding by its 

 more slender body, depth 1^ to 1| in head, and by the less projecting 

 lower jaw. " Now the type of Eleutheraciis coriaceus Cope shows the 

 depth greater than the length of the head, and the preopercular spines 

 2 on the left side (lower bifid) of the head and 3 on the right side. 

 The opercular spines are three on both sides, and both upper and 

 median of left side bifid.

RAFINESQUE'S TYPES OF UNIO. 

 BY E. G. VANATTA. 



Mr. C. A. Poulson, in A Monograph of the Fluviatile Bivalves of 

 the Ohio River, Translated from the French of Prof. C. S. Rafinesquey 

 Philadelphia (1832), p. v, states that he has "most of the shells 

 described" by Prof. Rafinesque in the Monographie des Coquilles 

 Bivalves Fluviatiles de la Riviere Ohio} These shells are now in the 

 collection of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, with 

 Rafinesque's original labels and ink numbers on the specimens. These 

 numbers are the same as those in Prof. Rafinesque's Monograph 

 of 1820. 



The fractions given bj' Rafinesque after each species indicate at 

 what point upon the shell a given dimension is found. The figured 

 species agree well with the types or specimens in hand. 



As some of Rafinesque's names are now in use, I believe it will 

 be of interest to determine by what names these shells are known 

 at the present time and the effect on nomenclature if they were 

 recognized and the names dated from 1820. 



Many of Rafinesque's species have been credited to Conrad by 

 Mr. C. T. Simpson.2 



Dr. H. A. Pilsbry, to whom this paper has been submitted, sug- 

 gests that it should be explicitly stated that the use of a Rafinesquian 

 name depends upon whether it could be identified by descriptions 

 published prior to any other recognizable name for the same species. 

 That it can be recognized from the types or other specimens from 

 Rafinesque does not entitle his names to acceptance unless the 

 published descriptions are adequate. This question of the adequacy 

 of published diagnoses must be considered for each species separately. 

 It is not taken up in this paper, which deals merely with the question 

 of the identity of the Rafinesque-Poulson specimens.

THE STRUCTURAL RELATIONS OF SOME DEVONIAN SHALES IN CENTRAL 



NEW YORK. 



BY BURNETT SMITH. 



The shale mass which intervenes between the Onondaga and 

 TuUy hmestones of central New York was formerly separated into 

 a lower division of Marcellus shales and an upper division of Hamilton 

 shales. It is now pretty generally conceded that this classification 

 is inadequate to express the facts and the geologists of the State of 

 New York now employ Marcellus shale, Cardiff shale, Skaneateles 

 shale, Ludlowville shale, and Moscow shale in describing the strati- 

 graphic units encountered in passing upward from the Onondaga 

 to the Tully. These shale units by inference correspond with 

 definite subdivisions of the Devonian time scale. They are also 

 regarded as possessing a rather wide east and west distribution 

 across the State. ^ Recent field studies in Onondaga and Cayuga 

 Counties have convinced the writer that the lower members of the 

 shale mass have a far from simple history. Followed in an east 

 and west line they present changes which remain unrecognized even 

 in the recent classifications. These notes are therefore submitted 

 as a partial record and preliminary interpretation of the observations 

 made. 



A brief survey of the general stratigraphy brings out the fact 

 that the shales have been deposited upon Onondaga limestone. 

 In some places the line between the Onondaga and the succeeding 

 black shale is quite sharp, but at others there is a transition zone of 

 limestone and black shale alternations in thin bands. Great varia- 

 tions in the amount of limestone intercalation are noticed in the 

 10 or 15 feet just above the Onondaga. One limestone stratum, 

 however, is shown in all good exposures. This layer known as the 

 Agoniatites limestone is about 3 feet in thickness and holds a position 

 approximately 10 or 15 feet above strata which are referable to the 

 Onondaga. Lying thus upon black shale or upon black shale and 

 limestone alternations the Agoniatites limestone is in turn followed 

 by a deposit of dense black shale in which concretions of large size 

 are apt to be a very conspicuous feature. This higher black shale

562 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



is now grouped with the other layers down to the Onondaga under 

 one formational term, Marcellus.- 



As used by Vanuxem,^ the term Marcellus apparently embraced 

 a still higher shale of gray color. This latter was given a separate 

 name by Clarke and Luther who in 1904 called it the Cardiff shale.'* 

 In the type region (on the Tully quadrangle) the change from the 

 Marcellus is most gradual while above the Cardiff is defined as 

 terminating some 20 feet below a thin band of limestone.^ This 

 limestone is grouped with the 20 feet of shale below and some hun- 

 dreds of feet above under a single formational term, Skaneateles. 



These general stratigraphic relations appear to hold good for 

 central Onondaga County, but on tracing the formations westward 

 deviations from the type section are noticed. It is now proposed 

 to present the evidence for these deviations. 



Just south of Mottville, on the Skaneateles quadrangle, occurs 

 a fossiliferous zone which is well displayed along the outlet of Skane- 

 ateles Lake. The section at this point shows a thickness of about 

 25 feet. In the lower part the shale is gray and thinly bedded 

 with small fossils numerous. Above come small concretions and 

 a limy band full of crinoid fragments. This latter is in turn overlaid 

 by a rather coarse and thickly bedded shale, also quite fossiliferous.^ 

 These strata are not here exposed in continuous section with any 

 easily recognized reference plane. It was with the intention of 

 ascertaining their position in the shale mass that the writer under- 

 took to follow these beds east and west from the Mottville locality. 



For the sake of simplicity the term Mottville member will be 

 used as a provisional designation for the limy crinoidal band and

" These layers were apparently well known to Vanuxem ; see Geology of the 

 Third District, p. 154. Speaking of Cayuga Lake, he says: "The first rock 

 going south on the lake, after passing the low clayey ground to the south of 

 Springport, may be considered as the dividing Hne between the Marcellus shales 

 and the Hamilton group. It is a dark slaty fossiliferous shale, with numerous 

 individuals of the Orthis umbonata of Mr. Conrad, but usually small, associated 

 with the Limitary orthis (O. hmitaris) also numerous, etc. It shows about 

 six feet of a brownish black impure limestone. This pai't forms the small rise 

 about half a mile or more below Levana. It appears in the road from Springport 

 to Levana, at Crise's brook; on the road to Auburn from Springport, two miles 

 southwest of Half-acre; to the northeast of Skaneateles on the road to Marcellus, 

 and on the north side of Pompey hill, etc." 



Though this description makes no mention of the Mottville locality, it shows 

 quite clearly that its author was familiar with many of the other good exposures 

 of these strata. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 563 



associated fossiliferous shales above and below which are exposed 

 along the Skaneateles outlet south of Mottville.'' This member 

 can be readily recognized by its lithologic and paleontologic char- 

 acters for a few miles east and west from the type section. Eastward 

 there is some slight change in its features, but the horizon can be 

 traced with little difficulty onto the Tully quadrangle where the 

 writer considers it to be identical with the basal layers of the Skane- 

 ateles formation up to and slightly above the limestone band already 

 mentioned.^ 



The presence of a thin fossiliferous zone between masses of rela- 

 tively barren shale is usually regarded as a matter of some paleon- 

 tologic interest and the Mottville is no exception in this respect. 

 It was not, however, until the writer studied the relations of this 

 member to underlying formations westward that he realized the 

 important position which the Mottville holds in any attempt to 

 solve the stratigraphy of the lower shale units. 



Its authors recognized that the Cardiff shale thins toward the 

 west, a statement to that effect appearing in their description of the 

 type sections.^ 



Nevertheless, the writer confesses that he was much surprised to 

 learn in the field that the gray shales between the harder limy por- 

 tions of the Mottville and the black Marcellus thin down to about 

 100 feet southeast of the village of Marcellus (Skaneateles quad- 

 rangle), to about 50 feet in the belt south of Shepard Settlement, 

 to about 25 feet near the western limit of the Skaneateles quadrangle, 

 and to about 15 feet on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake (Auburn 

 quadrangle). 



As stated above, the top of the Cardiff in the type locality has 

 been defined by its authors as being 20 feet below a limestone band 

 in their Skaneateles. The writer regards this limestone band as 

 the equivalent of the upper limy portions of the Mottville, and if 

 this correlation is correct there is very little room for a Cardiff 

 formation between the harder Mottville and the Marcellus of the 

 Auburn quadrangle. It is therefore believed that (in the absence 

 of positive diagnostic characters) the Cardiff shale cannot be differ- 

 entiated as a separate unit west of the Skaneateles quadrangle. 



• At the Mottville locality about 10 feet of shale are exposed below the crinoidal 

 band. In other sections an additional 10 or 15 feet of fossiliferous strata are 

 usually to be seen at the base. These latter beds, though not exposed at the 

 type locality, are included in the term Mottville as used in this paper. 



* The above refers to the Skaneateles formation as described by Clarke and 

 Luther; see N. Y. State Museum Bulletin 82.

From the Avestern boundary of the Skaneateles quadrangle ta 

 Cayuga Lake continuous sections are rare, but there is always some 

 reference plane by which to check the position of the Mottville 

 beds. In the same area there are also some slight variations in 

 lithologic character, but these are clearly of a progressive nature, 

 becoming more pronounced by slow degrees from east ,to west. 

 Paleontologic characters are well maintained throughout the region 

 in question and one more evidence of continuity is afforded by the 

 escarpment which is frequently produced by the harder layers. 



The more important sections met with in passing from the Tully 

 quadrangle to Cayuga Lake are shown slightly idealized in Plate 

 XXIL 



Section 2 is exposed in a ravine situated west of Cottle Hill and 

 about f mile from the western limit of the Skaneateles quadrangle. 

 The harder portions of the Mottville are well displayed at this 

 locality and their position relative to the black Marcellus is beyond 

 all question, for the section is continuous. About 1| miles south- 

 westerly at nearly the same altitude and on the Auburn quadrangle 

 is found another exposure of the Mottville crinoidal layer and asso- 

 ciated shales. Here unfortunately the black Marcellus is not 

 shown below in continuous section. It is exposed, however, at a 

 lower altitude in a near-by ravine within j mile to the west. The 

 relation is the same as that shown in section 2. This easternmost 

 Mottville exposure on the Auburn quadrangle is an important one. 

 It can be connected loy a nearly continuous escarpment with the 

 Mottville layers of section 2. It agrees in its lithologic and paleon- 

 tologic characters with other exposures of the Mottville. It lacks 

 only a continuous section to prove its stratigraphic position above 

 the Marcellus. These points are emphasized, for this Mottville 

 exposure has apparently received a far different interpretation on 

 the geologic map of the Auburn quadrangle.^'' 



A little south of Half Acre and about If miles southwesterly from- 

 the Auburn city line a good exposure of the Mottville member is 

 obtained. Here its position above the black Marcellus can be 

 determined in a nearly continuous section while the relations with 

 the Agoniatites limestone and the Styliolina layers below it are 

 scarcely less clear. 



Passing toward the southwest in the direction of Oakwood the 



1" N. Y. State Museum Bulletin 137. See map and also p. 18, where one 

 finds the following statement: "The Agoniatite limestone and adjacent black 

 shales outcrop i mile from the east line of the ciuadrangle by the side of the 

 third east and west road from the north line of the quadrangle." 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 565 



limy character of the upper harder layers is pronounced. They 

 stand out as a prominent escarpment for about 1| miles between 

 Half Acre and Oakwood." East and a little south of Oakwood on 

 the boundary line between the to\\Tis of Fleming and Springport 

 another good exposure of Mottville is found. At the point where 

 the roadway on the map is marked with an altitude of 707 feet the 

 harder layers of the Mottville are finely displayed. As stated 

 above, these harder layers undergo a certain amount of progressive 

 change toward the west. They are now quite limy and of bluish 

 shades which become lighter on exposure. Prolonged weathering 

 produces a duller and more rusty appearance which, together with 

 numerous ''cauda-galli" markings, causes a curious resemblance 

 to the very much higher beds which are usually assigned to the 

 Ludlowville. At this town line exposure the relations with the 

 Agoniatites limestone are again determinable, for the latter is exposed 

 in a field south of the road which parallels the Lehigh Valley track. 



At the four corners which lie about 1^ miles south and a little 

 -east of Oakwood the Mottville is again displayed and is connected 

 by a fairly well-marked escarpment with the localities northeast. 

 Here at these four corners the relations with lower strata can be 

 made out, the Agoniatites limestone outcropping at the slight bend 

 in the north-leading road f mile to the north, the Onondaga lime- 

 stone and Styliolina layers by the roadside about f mile to the west. 

 The writer wishes to emphasize the fact that his interpretation of 

 the stratigraphy between Half Acre and these four corners is based 

 ■on evidence furnished (1) by lithologic and paleontologic similarity 

 of the different Mottville exposures, (2) by the position of each 

 exposure with reference to some easily recognized lower stratum 

 and (3) by the occurrence of the exposures on the edge of a hard 

 rock platform which frequently displays a well-marked escarpment 

 •on its northern and northwestern fronts. These lines of evidence 

 lead to a conception of the stratigraphy, Avhich is quite chfTerent 

 from that sho^^^l on the geologic map of the Auburn quadrangle.^^ 



On approaching Cayuga Lake the harder portion of the Mottville 

 produces the falls just east of the lake road in Great Gully Brook 

 ^nd in the next brook south which is unnamed on the map.^^ This 

 latter is apparently the Crise's Brook of Vanuxem and is called

Criss Creek by Luther whose interpretation of its section seems 

 to be as follows: The hard layer producing the falls near the lake 

 road bridge is "Near the top " of the " Cardiff. " A " gray f ossilif erous 

 band at the base of the formation" Avhich occurs at the private road 

 crossing farther north is attributed to the horizon of the Stafford 

 limestone of western New York. 



The present writer's interpretation of the same section may be 

 summarized in this way: The hard layers making the falls near 

 the lake road bridge are the upper limy portion of the Mottville. 

 They are underlaid by about 15 feet of gray shale rich in small 

 fossils. These latter are the lower soft shales of the Mottville and 

 are considered the equivalent of strata which on the Tully quad- 

 rangle have been assigned to the Skaneateles by others. A short 

 distance below the lake road bridge their contact with the under- 

 lying black Marcellus is well displayed. The "gray fossilif erous 

 band" exposed near the private road crossing farther down stream 

 is not connected by continuous section with the Mottville at the 

 lake road bridge. It has the same lithologic and paleontologic 

 characters as the lower 15 feet of Mottville at the lake road bridge. 

 It is also immediately overlaid by material indistinguishable from 

 the harder Mottville, while a short distance still farther down stream 

 another exposure of typical Marcellus is found. It is believed that 

 the lakeward dip which is plainly visible in places and a slight folding 

 are responsible for the repetition of the strata. 



This latter interpretation is amply confirmed by a study of the 

 lake shore sections east and west of the Lehigh Valley track between 

 Levanna and Farley's. It also appears to be in harmony with the 

 section of the region which was published by. Cleland in 1903.^^ 



Summary of Observations. 

 The writer believes that the following points have been demon- 

 strated : 



(1) That the Marcellus black shale is continuous from the Tully 

 quadrangle to the east shore of Cayuga Lake (as stated in sul)stance 

 by Vanuxem) and that it thins considerably to the westward. 



(2) That the Cardiff shale, as' defined by its authors, thins rapidly 

 toward the west and becomes unrecognizable as a separate unit 

 before the Auburn quadrangle is reached. 



(3) That the Mottville member (basal Skaneateles of the Tully 

 quadrangle) is continuous throughout the region, lying on the 



» U. S. G. S. Bulletin 206, p. 21, fig. 2. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 567 



Cardiff to the east, but overlapping it and coming in contact with 

 the Marcellus to the west. 



Theoretical Considerations. 



If the points outhned above are admitted, a number of questions 

 immediately arise. The first to be considered is this: How far 

 westward does the overlap type of structure persist? If it extends 

 to the western limit of the State involving each higher unit in turn, 

 it is clear that younger and younger material will come to lie in 

 contact with the basal black shale. Much depends upon the deter- 

 mination of the western equivalent of the Mottville. Should it 

 prove referable to the Stafford limestone,^^ the present writer could 

 not escape the conclusion that the Stafford of western New York 

 is the equivalent of the lowermost Skaneateles of the central portions 

 of the State. In such a case the Stafford of western New York 

 separates not the Marcellus from the Cardiff, but the Marcellus 

 from the bulk of the Skaneateles formation. 



If, on the other hand, the overlap westward goes no farther than 

 Cayuga Lake, we may be dealing with a north and south axis of 

 Onondaga limestone, on each side of which the shale units are repro- 

 duced in a similar stratigraphic succession. Though this view is 

 well within the bounds of possibility, it can hardly be said that the 

 known examples of the Onondaga-Marcellus contact furnish evidence 

 in its support. 



Opportunity has not yet been found for anything like a thorough 

 paleontological study of the Mottville beds. The species so far 

 identified reveal a fauna not unlike that of the Stafford. It is 

 believed, however, that correlation based upon fossils alone is most 

 unsafe in determining the position of these Mottville strata. 



Returning to the stratigraphic aspects of the problem, it may be 

 said that overlap in the structural sense can hardly be questioned. 



1^ In this connection see N. Y. State Museum Bulletin 49, p. 120, where occurs 

 the following statement by Dr. John M. Clarke: 



"In the outcrops along Criss creek, 2^ miles south of Union Springs, the 

 strata above the horizon of the Agoniatite limestone are shown, and a point of 

 interest in this section is the presence of a bed of 1.5 feet of blue and olive cal- 

 careous shales, lying above the general mass of darker shales, which carries 

 certain trilobites (Homalonotus, Phacops), brachiopods, gastropods, etc. per- 

 taining to the normal Hamilton shale fauna. These shales he at about the 

 proper horizon of the Stafford limestone, though no trace of this rock has been 

 seen so far east." 



There can be little doubt that Dr. Clarke is describing the upper limy portions 

 of the Mottville which are exposed in this creek. It is perhaps unnecessary to 

 add that, in the matter of Stafford correlation, one could hardly look to a more 

 authoritative source. 




568 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



That is (1) a fossiliferous zone is separated from a black shale by a 

 bed of barren gray shale, (2) followed west the fossil zone is seen to 

 approach nearer and nearer to the black shale in successive sections, 

 (3) at the west the fossiliferous zone lies immediately above the 

 black shale. 



Such relations at least suggest an unconformity somewhere in the 

 series. The writer has, however, failed to discover positive evidence 

 of one in passing from the Onondaga to the Mottville. It is true 

 that the base of the Mottville limy layer is frequently very uneven. 

 The same observation likewise holds for the Agoniatites limestone. 

 Both cases are, however, regarded as due to a concretionary struc- 

 ture; limy segregations merely pushing downward into the strata 

 below. 



When considered in relation to the general black shale problem, 

 it is believed that the data obtained in this area go to strengthen the 

 theories which explain the Marcellus as an invasion from the east 

 and south toward the north and west.^^ On the other hand, trans- 

 gression over a land surface is somewhat questionable; in fact, the 

 evidence rather points to a different conclusion. We are apparently 

 justified in regarding the Marcellus as a formation Avhich, so to 

 speak, runs diagonally across the geologic column, its lower layers 

 and more eastern portions being contemporary with some Onondaga 

 to the west while its upper and more western portions were probably 

 deposited at a time when Cardiff sedimentation was occurring to 

 the east. 



Evidence presented by Kindle^^ shows that black shale (presumably 

 Marcellus) deposition in the Allegheny region was taking place at 

 the same time with Onondaga accumulation. For the particular 

 area here studied it is sufficient to call attention to the thin black 

 shale intercalations which are found in the Onondaga south of 

 Union Springs. The very gradual transition from Marcellus to 

 Cardiff and the general structure outlined in these notes both argue 

 for partial contemporaneity between Cardiff and Marcellus.

570 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The following annual reports were referred to the Publication 

 Committee : 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



Six meetings were held during the year, with an average attend- 

 ance of fifty-eight. Communications of interest, as recorded in 

 the Proceedings, were made at the sessions held February 16, 

 March 16, and April 20. 



Twenty-eight papers have been presented for publication, as follows : 



Henry W. Fowler, 4; Adele M. Fielde, 2; E. G. Vanatta, 2; H. A. 



Pilsbry and James H. Ferris, 2; T. Barbour and G. K. Noble, 1; 



William H. Dall, 1; N. E. Mclndoo, 1; H. Matsumoto, 1; James 



A. G. Rehn, 1; Albert P. Morse and Morgan Hebard, 1; James 



A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard, 1; William Churchill, 1; Stanislas 

 Meunier, 1; Charles P. Alexander, 1; Edgar T. Wherry and S. G. 

 Gordon, 1; John W. Harshberger, 1; S. Stillman Berry, 1; Clarence 



B. Moore, 1; Phineas W. Whiting, 1; Howard Crawley, 1; Burnett 

 Smith, 1, and Nathan Banks, 1. 



Twenty-one of these have been printed, four are awaiting publica- 

 tion, one appeared as a contribution to the Journal, and two were re- 

 turned to the authors. 



Six hundred and sixteen pages of the Proceedings, illustrated 

 by twenty-five plates, have been printed. The second part of the 

 sixteenth volume of the Journal has also been issued. It consists 

 of a paper on the evolution of color pattern in a genus of Lepidoptera, 

 by Miss Annette Frances Braun, and a beautiful addition to Mr. 

 Clarence B, Moore's papers on his exploration of southern burial 

 mounds, forming together three hundred and twenty-two pages and 

 six plates. Miss Braun defrayed the cost of the two plates illus- 

 trating her paper and we are again indebted to Mr. Moore for the 

 entire cost of publishing his contribution. 



Of the Transactions of the American Entomological Society 

 (Entomological Section of the Academy) five hundred and nine 

 pages and twenty-four plates have appeared. The Section has also 

 issued five hundred pages illustrated by twenty plates of the Ento- 

 mological News. 



Eighty pages and ten plates have been added to the Manual of 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 571 



CoNCHOLOGY, making the output of the year 2,027 pages and 85 

 plates. 



The war has interfered with the distribution of these pubUcations 

 to correspondents as the International Bureau of Exchange has 

 been forced to suspend communication with Belgium, Germany, 

 Austria, Russia, Servia, Bulgaria, and Roumania. The several 

 issues intended for these countries have, however, been directed and 

 stored away in anticipation of the happier time when they can be 

 sent to their destinations. 



Four members and ten correspondents have been elected. The 

 deaths of thirteen members and three correspondents have been 

 announced. Resignations of membership were accepted from Walter 

 M. James and Edwin B. Bartram. 



George Vaux, Jr., was reappointed by the Council the Solicitor 

 of the Academy; Frank J. Keeley was continued as Curator of the 

 William S. Vaux Collections and Joseph Willcox as Custodian of the 

 Isaac Lea Collection of Eocene fossils. Dr. Spencer Trotter was 

 placed on the Library Committee to fill the vacancy caused by the 

 death of Dr. Thomas Biddle. 



The following courses of lectures have been delivered in connection 

 with the Ludwick Institute: Witmer Stone, three on wild bird life; 

 B. Franklin Royer, one on housing in relation to health; F. Herbert 

 Snow, one on Philadelphia's water supply; Henry A. Pilsbry, three 

 on problems in the study of faunas; Henry Skinner, three on ento- 

 mology; Spencer Trotter, three on phj^siography and life relations 

 of North America; Stewardson Brown, three on local wild flowers. 



In harmony with the original intention of the Ludwick Foundation,, 

 ten additional lectures were delivered on Wednesday afternoons 

 up to March to the teachers and classes of the Girls' High School. 



A Committee of Conference with one representing the American 

 Entomological Society considered carefully a modification of the 

 articles of agreement providing for the union of the Academy and 

 the Society, but the result was not reached in time to be included 

 in this report. 



Much the most important event in the history of the Academy 

 during the past year was the adoption, January 19, of amendments 

 to the By-Laws providing for the loaning of certain* books from the 

 Library, reducing the number of stated meetings to six, repealing 

 the requirement of an initiation fee, and changing the procedure 

 for the election of members. 



These amendments were adopted January 19 on the recommenda- 

 tion of the Council and are as follows: 




572 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Chapter II, Art. 1 : Change "the last stated meeting of the 

 month" to ''any stated meeting." 



Art. 2: Change first sentence to read "Candidates 

 for membership shall be nominated in writing by at least two mem- 

 bers, who shall record the name and place of residence. The nomina- 

 tions shall be posted in the Hall of the Academy and read before a 

 meeting of the Council and the candidate shall be balloted for at 

 any subsequent stated meeting, provided that at least two weeks 

 shall have elapsed since their nomination and posting. 



Art. 3: Change "fee of initiation" to "first annual 

 contribution." 



Art. 4: Change "fee of initiation" to "first annual 

 contribution." 



Art. 11: Change "fee of initiation" to "the annual 

 contribution. " 



Art. 13: Omit "an initiation fee of Ten Dollars and 

 ^n" and substitute "the" for "an." 



Art. 14: Omit "and all initiation fees." 



Art. 17: Omit "who has not paid the initiation fee 

 ■or." 



Chapter IV, Art. 1 : Omit the word "monthly" in the last sentence 

 ;and alter "day" to "days," i.e., to read: "days on which the meeting 

 .shall be held." 



Chapter IX, Art. 3 : Change to read "Certain books specified 

 by the Librarian and the Library Committee may be loaned to 

 members for a period of not exceeding one month. A list of such 

 books shall be prepared for the consultation of members and books 

 may be added to it or withdrawn from it at the discretion of the 

 Librarian and the Library Committee. The Librarian shall keep a 

 record of all books loaned with the dates of loan and return. 



Chapter XII, Art. 1: Change the first clause to read "The stated 

 meetings of the Academy shall be held on tlic third Tuesdays of 

 November, December, January, February, March, and April." 



Art. 5: Insert "stated" before "meetings" in the 

 first line. 



Art. 6: The first line should read "The order of 

 business at the annual meetings shall be." 



It will be seen that several of the amendments merely conform 

 to the requirement of the changes specially referred to. 



The effect of the By-Law authorizing the loaning of books is 

 stated in the report of the Librarian. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. .573 



On the adoption of these amendments a new edition of the By- 

 Laws was printed and distril)uted. 



The usual societies have held meetings in the Academy during 

 the year. 



Edward J. Nolan, Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



The diminished volume of foreign correspondence and reduced 

 number of international scientific congresses commented upon in the 

 last annual report of the Corresponding Secretary were even more 

 apparent in 1915, inasmuch as the conditions were operative through- 

 out the entire year. 



Death collected an unusually heavy toll from the roll of corre- 

 spondents, including some of the most eminent, as follows: Leon 

 Vaillant, James Geikie, A. A. W. Hubrecht, Richard Lydekker, 

 Frederic W. Putnam, Theodor Boveri, George M. Sternberg, Edw. L. 

 Greene, Orville A. Derby, and H. E. Dresser. 



To insure a more systematic and careful examination into the 

 qualifications of proposed candidates for correspondents, a committee 

 of Council on the nomination of correspondents was appointed. 

 Upon the recommendation of this committee the following named 

 were nominated by the Council and elected by the Academy: 

 Alfred C. Haddon, Wilhelm Ludwig Johannsen, William Trelease, 

 Carl Diener, Samuel Wendell Williston, Charles E. Barrois, Thomas 

 Chrowder Chamberlin, Albrecht Penck, William Bateson, and Stanislas 

 Meunier. 



The principal invitations received during the year were to the 

 inauguration exercises of Edward Kidder Graham as President of 

 the University of North Carolina, at which Professor H. V, Wilson 

 served as the representative of this Academy; the twenty-fifth 

 anniversary of the founding of The Nebraska Academy of Sciences, 

 Professor George T. Moore being our representative; the commence- 

 ment exercises of the University of Pittsburgh; the twenty-fifth 

 annual meeting of the Ohio Academy of Science, to which Dr. Howard 

 Ayers went as our delegate; the fiftieth anniversary of the adminis- 

 tration of Alexander F.' de Waldheim as Director of the Imperial 

 Botanical Garden of Petrograd, which was acknowledged by a 

 letter of congratulation; and to the postponed meeting of the Nine- 

 teenth International Congress of Americanists, which is to convene 




574 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



in Washington this month and to which the Honorable Charles D. 

 Walcott and Miss H. Newell Wardle were last year appointed 

 delegates. 



Letters thanking the Academy for courtesies extended during the 

 Convocation Week meetings of 1915 were received from the American 

 Association for the Advancement of Science, the Geological Society 

 of America, and the American Fern Society. 



Correspondence with individuals and institutions requesting 

 information on a variety of subjects was conducted as usual.

A well-bound copy of the Rev. J. G. Wood's Animate Creation, in 

 three volumes, quarto, has been given to the Academy by Miss 

 Ella B. Altemus, in memory of the late William Wilkinson Altemus. 



The notable decrease in the number of additions to the Library 

 during 1915 has been due to two causes: A lessening of appropria- 

 tions, but more especially the interference with foreign correspondence 

 by the horrible war which is, in one way or another, affecting every 

 human interest, most of them disastrously. The German production 

 of scientific publications was at first sustained, but is now decreasing. 

 Out of sixty-nine German periodicals subscribed for nothing has been 

 received from twenty-one of them. The English journals continue 

 as usual, and the French, while much affected at first, are now for 

 the most part going on as before the war. We have been warned 

 by the Royal Academy of the I.incei, the Royal Academy of Sciences 

 of Petrograd, and the Chemical Society of London that issues for- 

 Avarded now must be at our risk, as losses, if any occur, will not 

 be made up. In these cases it has been thought best to ask for a 

 prompt supply of publications, assuming such risk as may be in- 

 volved, for it will probably not be more than we should run in 

 expecting the volumes in bulk at the end of the conflict. 




578 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Shipments from Germany and Austria were stopped by a British 

 Order in Council in June. We are informed, however, that the 

 British Government is now prepared to issue permits for shipment 

 of scientific books to the United States from Germany and Austria 

 if destined for universities, colleges, scientific societies or public 

 bodies. We may profit during the coming year by this relaxation, 

 although it is accompanied by a great deal of annoying red tape. 



The interruption of exchange noted in the report of the Recording 

 Secretary of course greatly affects the receipts from corresponding 

 societies. Even when regular shipments are made invoices and 

 bills of lading are held up on the other side and insufficient steamer 

 accommodations cause uncertain deliveries. 



Chapter IX, Art. 3, of the By-Laws was amended in January so 

 as to permit of the loaning to members of certain books specified by 

 the Librarian and the Library Committee for a period not exceeding 

 one month. 



Although it was held Ijy Maclure and his contemporaries that all 

 books belonging to the Academy should be exclusively for use within 

 the building, both for the good of those working on the premises 

 and to lessen the danger of loss, it was considered that such a rule 

 was not practicable until the services of a Librarian during portions 

 of the day could be secured. Certain designated books were there- 

 fore permitted to be borrowed until 1850, Avhen Thomas B. Wilson 

 presented to the Academy the extremely valuable works which he 

 had from time to time deposited with the understanding that they 

 should never be loaned on any condition. This applied to such an 

 important portion of the Lil^rary that the rule was then made 

 general and from 1850 until last January no books were knowingly 

 allowed to leave the building except to be bound. 



Since the new rule has been in operation forty-six works in fifty- 

 eight volumes have been borrowed. These have all been returned 

 but two, which are now alone outstanding. 



A system of registry of works taken for use in the Academy's 

 study rooms has been adopted. 822 titles in 1,061 volumes have 

 been placed at the service of students and workers in the building. 

 375 of these are still in use. 



While a few of the books taken from the building have manifestly 

 been for more or less desultory reading, the others have undoubtedly 

 been for serious consultation and study, so that there is reason to believe 

 that the operation of the new law is, as far as it goes, for the advance- 

 ment of science without any counterbalancing disadvantage. By 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 579 



direction of the Council, no volumes or parts of journals or periodicals 

 ma}^ be borrowed without the special consent of the Librarian, who 

 must be reasonably sure, before the publication is sent out, that the 

 interests of those working on the premises will not be interfered with 

 by the loan. 



As required by the By-Law, a separate list of books that can be 

 borrowed is being prepared and is nearing completion. 



A very desirable subject index to the map collection has been 

 prepared by Mr. Fox. 



Forty-seven volumes of works not connected with the Academy's 

 interests have been transferred to the Free Library of Philadelphia. 



A framed photograph of Rembrandt Peale's oil portrait of Reuben 

 Haines, who served most- efficiently as Corresponding Secretary 

 from February, 1814, to December, 1831, has been presented by his 

 grandson, Reuben Haines. 



A framed photograph from life of the late Dr. Benjamin Sharp 

 has been received from Mrs. Sharp. 



Through the liberality of a number of subscribers, there has been 

 obtained a replica of the portrait of Baron Von Huml)oldt, painted 

 from life in 1856 by J. R. Lambdin, and now in the rooms of the Ameri- 

 can Philosophical Society. The picture has been beautifully framed 

 by the President of the Academy. 



It is pleasant to again acknowledge the good work done by William 

 J. Fox and Furman Sheppard Wilde, both in the Library and in 

 connection with the issue of the publications. 



Edward J. Nolan, Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The completion of the year 1915 finds the Academy's buildings 

 and collections in excellent condition. Much important work has 

 been accomplished in studying, arranging, and cataloguing material 

 in the several departments of the Museum, and many important 

 accessions have been received through gift or purchase. 



The number of visitors to the Museum has steadily increased, 

 especially classes from the schools of Philadelphia and vicinity 

 which come to study the exhibits under the guidance of their teachers. 



At the last session of the State Legislature the sum of .$10,000 was 

 appropriated to the Academy for the purchase of cases, and arrange- 

 ments have been made to furnish the north wing of the Museum 

 with exhibition cases so that it may be reopened to the public during 




580 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



the ensuing year, and to provide much needed exhibition and storage 

 cases in the various departments. 



During the past year the Curators have purchased three large 

 mahogany and plate-glass exhibition cases, one for a group of buffalo 

 and two for the collection of wood of native forest trees. Two 

 horizontal oak cases have also been procured for the William S. Vaux 

 archaeological collection, as well as eighteen metal storage cases, 

 450 trays and 100 insect boxes. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore continued his explorations among the 

 Indian mounds of the Southern States, the results of which have been 

 generously added to the Clarence B. Moore Collection. 



A valuable collection of Antarctic material obtained on Sir Ernest 

 Shackleton's expedition was presented by Mr. John H. McFadden. 

 The framed photographs of scenery and animals have been placed 

 on exhibition in the lower hallways and the other specimens 

 arranged in the several departments. 



Leave of absence was granted to several members of the Museum 

 staff for the prosecution of field work. Through the liberality of 

 Mr. Morgan Hebard, Mr. J. A. G. Rehn was enabled to accompany 

 him on a two months' trip through the Gulf States from northern 

 Florida to eastern Texas, for the purpose of studying the Orthoptera 

 of the region, one-half of the material obtained becoming the property 

 of the Academy. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry spent the greater part of August and Septem- 

 ber in an exploration of the Black Range of New Mexico, obtaining 

 large series of land mollusks, part of them new to science, as well as 

 collections of reptiles and plants. 



Mr. Stewardson Brown accompanied Dr. and Mrs. N. L. Britton , 

 on a botanical expedition to Porto Rico, and Dr. Witmer Stone 

 did some general collecting in California and Minnesota, incidental 

 to attending the. meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union 

 in San Francisco. 



The usual amount of local field work was also carried on. 



Details of Museum work in the various departments follow. 



Mammals. 



A fine group of three buffalo, a bull, cow and calf, which had been 

 previously mounted, was arranged in a large exhibition case secured 

 during the year. It adds much to the attractiveness of the mammal 

 hall. 



The skeletons of the Right, Hump-back and Sperm Whales have- 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 581 



been articulated and mounted in the centres of the geological and 

 mineralogical halls and attract much attention. This work was 

 done by the Academy's taxidermist, Mr. David McCadden, assisted 

 by Mr. E. W. Stucke. 



The collection of skins of the larger mammals was carefully gone 

 over during the year and systematically arranged by Dr. Witmer 

 Stone, while the entire osteological collection was systematized and 

 labelled by Mr. Earl L. Poole, a student on the Jessup Fund. This 

 collection is now readily accessible and its usefulness vastly increased. 



Twenty-six mammals have been received from the Zoological 

 Society of Philadelphia during the year, which have been variously 

 prepared by the taxidermist as skins or osteological material. 



A set of the McGregor restorations of Pithecanthropus and other 

 early anthropoid and human types was presented by Dr. Samuel G. 

 Dixon. 



Numerous students have made use of the collections during the 

 year and specimens have been loaned to Drs. J. A. Allen and C. Hart 

 Merriam, Messrs. W. H. Osgood and H. W. Henshaw. 



Birds. 



The rearrangement and renovation of the study series of birds 

 have progressed satisfactorily during the year and only five families 

 of the Passeres and the Steganopodes still demand attention. Mr. 

 D. E. Culver, student on the Jessup Fund, has relaxed the old 

 unmounted specimens and remade many of the skins, while Dr. 

 Witmer Stone has systematically arranged and labelled the groups 

 as they were completed. He has also entirely rearranged the local 

 study series of land birds, bringing all of the local material together 

 for the first time. 



A number of specimens have been identified for the Zoological 

 Society and for correspondents. 



Mr. Samuel N. Rhoads, accompanied by Mr. Earl L. Poole, 

 undertook an expedition to Guatemala, from February to April, in 

 the interests of the Academy, the expenses being met partly by the 

 Academy and partly by Mrs. Beulah M. Rhoads and William P. 

 Elkinton. 



A fine series of about 700 birds, a number of mammals and some 

 specimens in other branches were obtained. 



Besides this material an additional series of birds from Santa Marta, 

 Colombia, was purchased, as well as a series of Petrels from South 

 Georgia Island. 




582 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC.,. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club has added a number of 

 rare and valuable specimens to the local collection and other local 

 material was received from various sources. 



Six metal-covered storage cases were substituted for the old 

 wooden cases formerly used for the larger birds and the specimens, 

 arranged to much better advantage. By the end of next year it i^ 

 expected that the entire collection of skins will be accommodated 

 in metal cases. 



Mr. James P. Chapin spent two days studying the Academy's 

 type series of West African birds and Mr. Rhoads has spent con- 

 siderable time in the department preparing a report on his Guatemala 

 collection. 



Many local students have made use of the study collection and 

 specimens have been loaned to Drs. F. M. Chapman, C. W. Rich- 

 mond, Messrs. R. Ridgway, W. E. C. Todd, C. B. Cory, H. K. Coale 

 and R. C. Murphy. 



Reptiles and BatraChians. 



This department has, as in 1914, been under the charge of 

 Mr. Henry W. Fowler. All accessions have been identified and 

 cared for, 153 having been tagged, catalogued and distributed. 

 The entire series of Salamanders has been critically studied and rear- 

 ranged and a collection of reptiles and batrachians from Porto Rica 

 has been identified for Princeton University, in return for which 

 service the Academy received a fine series of duplicates. Mr. E. R. 

 Dunn has spent much time studying the collections in this department 

 and Dr. Thomas Barbour spent two days examining some of the 

 types. Several specimens were loaned to Dr. Barbour. 



Fishes. 



In this department, which is also under Mr. Fowler's care, much 

 irhportant work has been accomplished. Mr. Fowler has catalogued, 

 labelled and distributed 3,648 specimens during the year. He has also 

 prepared and published papers on collections of fishes from Canada 

 and tropical America, and has made a critical study of the Killi-fishea 

 and their allies. 



MOLLUSKS. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, special curator of this department, reports 

 that accessions have been received during the year from 82 persons 

 and institutions. Among the more extensive accessions are a series 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 583 



from Washington and Oregon, received from Mr. John A. Allen; 

 Antarctic shells of the Sir Ernest Shackleton Expedition, from 

 Mr. John H. McFadden, and Mexican shells from C. R. Orcutt. 

 Messrs. Clarence B. Moore, Morgan Hebard, S. S. Berry and others 

 have made many gifts of southern and western shells, and Mr. 

 Baj^ard Long has continued his collections in New Jersey. 



The John Ford collection of Olividce, purchased during the year, 

 when added to that of the Academy, forms probably the most 

 extensive series of these shells in any museum. 



With Mr. James H. Ferriss, the special curator spent the greater 

 part of August and September in an exploration of the Black Range 

 of New Mexico, obtaining large series of land moUusks, part of them 

 new to science. 



We have also been favored with a complete series of the mollusks 

 taken by Messrs. Junius Henderson and D. E. Daniels, who collected 

 in many localities from Provo, Utah, to Franklin in southern Idaho. 



The study of Hawaiian material of the expedition of 1913 has 

 been continued throughout the year. The family Tornatellinidce 

 has been completed, and a monograph published in the Manual of 

 CoNCHOLOGY, Volume XXIII. The proportion of undescribed 

 forms proved to be unusually large, the volume containing descrip- 

 tions of 103 new species and 29 new subspecies. Dr. C. Montague 

 Cooke, of the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, collaborated with the 

 special curator in this work. 



Mr. E. G. Vanatta, assistant in the department, has been chiefly 

 occupied in the determination and labelling of specimens received. 

 Miss Caroline Ziegler has continued the work of cataloguing the 

 collection. 



The Wheatley collection of fresh-water shells has been deposited 

 by the University of Pennsylvania, and some progress has been made 

 in cleaning, labelling and cataloguing the specimens. 



During the year the collections have been stuched by Messrs. 

 George H. Clapp, Frank M. Anderson, Drs. W. H. Dall and A. 

 Olssen, wdiile material has been loaned to Drs. W. H. Dall and Paul 

 Bartsch, Messrs. Junius Henderson and J. B. Henderson. 



Insects. 



Dr. Henry Skinner, head of the department of Insects, reports 

 that much of his time and that of Mr. E. T. Cresson, Jr., has been 

 devoted to relaxing and mounting the new material acquired. Por- 

 tions of the collection have also been rearranged in the new cases 

 procured during the year. 




584 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



In the order Diptera the famihes Tipulidae and DoHchopodidse 

 have been rearranged. 



In the Coleoptera the labelling of the Horn types has been con- 

 tinued and the rearrangement of the family Scarabseidse completed. 



In the Hymenoptera, the rearrangement of the Ophionini and 

 Pimplinse has been finished. 



In the Lepidoptera, the Welles collection was safely transported 

 from Ehvyn, Pa., and the following families rearranged: Agrotinse, 

 Syntomidse, Saturnidse, Lycsenidse, and the exotic Nymphalidse and 

 part of the Pieridse. The genera Kallima, Papaipema and Autographa 

 were also rearranged. 



In the Orthoptera the series of the genera Orchelimum, Cono- 

 cephalus and Atlanticus have been rearranged in the new type of 

 double box, which was all the general rearrangement possible during 

 the year with the few boxes available. 



Mr. J. A. G. Rehn spent two months in the field in company with 

 Mr. Morgan Hebard, working in the Gulf States from northern 

 Florida to eastern Texas. The trip, which was highly successful, 

 resulted in securing a very large series from the most neglected 

 portion of the eastern States, of which collection the Academy will 

 receive one-half. 



Mr. Hebard has continued his studies, based very largely on the 

 material in his own collection, here deposited, and in the Academy 

 series. He has also continued to maintain a preparator, whose 

 services as in the past have been given very liberally to the Academy. 

 By his aid it was possible to have mounted practically all the 

 previously unmounted Orthoptera owned by the Academy. In 

 collaboration with Mr. Hebard, Mr. Rehn has completed the final 

 portion of an extensive paper on the Orthoptera of the southeastern 

 United States, which was based largely on the field work conducted 

 under the auspices of the Academy. The same authors have made a 

 synoptical study of the genus Atlanticus and progress has been made 

 on a similar treatment of the genus Mermiria. 



Mr. Rehn has been and is at present engaged in studying extensive 

 Brazilian collections, of which the Academy will receive the first 

 set of such material as it does not already possess. He has also 

 made some additional progress with the study of the extensive 

 African collections placed in his hands by other institutions, but 

 owing to the greater urgency of other work this has been temporarily 

 laid aside. 



A large number of visiting entomologists have studied the collec- 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 585 



tions, including Messrs. A. F. Satterthwait, A. P. Morse, E. Daecke, 

 C. W. Long, W. T. Davis, J. C. Bradley, Charles Schaeffer, J. C. 

 Crawford, S. A. Rohwer, A. B. Gahen, R. A. Cushman, A. N. Caudell, 

 and A. Avinoff. 



Material has been loaned to Dr. E. M. Walker. 



Other Invertebrates. 



Mr. H. W. Fowler has looked after the alcoholic material and 

 arranged numerous small local collections of spiders, Crustacea, etc. 

 Mr. J. H. Emerton has studied the series of spiders during the year. 

 Specimens of annelids have been loaned to Dr. C. A. Kofoid, and 

 J. F. Daniel. 



Invertebrate Fossils. 



Dr. A. P. Brown has spent considerable time at the Academy 

 during the summer months studying the collections in this depart- 

 ment and in conjunction with Dr. Pilsbry has prepared a report on 

 the Oligocene fossils obtained by Mr. Lloyd B. Smith in Colombia. 



Drs. A. Olsen and L. W. Stephenson have spent some time studying 

 the collections, and material has been loaned to F. W. Stanton and 

 T. Wayland Vaughan. 



Vertebrate Fossils. 



The large slabs of fossil footprints together with certain geological 

 specimens have been arranged on the wall spaces between the windows 

 in the mineralogical hall. 



Material was loaned during the year to Drs. 0. P. Hay and J. C. 

 Merriam, and in return for the courtesy Dr. Merriam presented the 

 Academy with a specimen of Smilodon from the asphalt deposits 

 of the Rancho La Brea, California. 



Herbarium. 



Mr. Stewardson Bro\\Ti's continued illness has again kept him from 

 his duties in charge of the Herbarium for about half of the past year, 

 while for several months he was absent with Dr. N. L. Britton on a 

 collecting trip to Porto Rico. 



During his absence the Academy has again been dependent upon 

 the voluntary services of Messrs. Bayard Long and S. S. Van Pelt, 

 who have generously looked after the general herbarium in addition 

 to their continued care and development of the local herbarium 

 in which they have interested themselves for a number of years. 

 38 




586 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Work has necessarily been mainly confined to caring for the 

 accessions. Miss Ada Allen has continued Avith the mounting of 

 the specimens and has prepared for cataloguing and distribution 

 3,150 sheets. Mr. Van Pelt has mounted all accessions to the local 

 collection, amounting to 3,114 sheets and including 664 from the 

 Porter herbarium, which have been distinctively labelled in accordance 

 with the agreement with Lafayette College, by which institution 

 they were deposited. 



Mr. Long has distributed and identified material added to the 

 local herbarium and made critical studies of various groups. He 

 has also attended to much correspondence in connection with the 

 general collection. 



The herbarium has been consulted during the year by Dr. C. S. 

 Sargent, W. W. Eggieston, Harold St. John, Francis Pennell and 

 many others, and specimens have been loaned to W. W. Eggieston, 

 P. C. Standley, Dr. R. H. Howe, Dr. J. C. Arthur, K. K. McKenzie, 

 B. H. Smith, Dr. C. S. Sargent, Dr. F. Pennell, Harold St. John, 

 Dr. J. M. Greenman, Prof. M. L. Fernald. 



The collection of trunk sections of native trees of the Alleghanies 

 presented by Mr. C. H. Jennings has been prepared for exhibition 

 and placed in two mahogany and plate-glass cases in the mineralogical 

 hall just outside the entrance to the herbarium, where it attracts 

 much attention. 



Minerals and Rocks. 



Mr. S. G. Gordon, under the direction of Mr. Frank J. Keeley, 

 Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections, has completed a check 

 list of minerals according to the sixth edition of Dana's Manual 

 as an aid in the rearrangement of the collection which will be under- 

 taken during the coming year. 



Several of the cases in the hall were rearranged and part of the 

 specimens transferred to cases presented by the Curwin Stoddart 

 Estate. 



Mr. Gordon has also redetermined most of the rock specimens 

 and in part relabelled them, while many minerals in the general 

 collection have also been redetermined. Many members of the 

 Oeological Society of America took occasion to examine the collec- 

 tions during the annual meeting of the Society at the Academy, in 

 December, 1914. 




1915.] natural sciences of philadelphia. 587 



Archeology and Ethnology. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore has placed on exhibition in this department 

 the material obtained on his expeditions during the year. 



Two additional exhibition cases were obtained by the William S. 

 Vaux Fund for the display of the European archaeological material 

 in that collection, chiefly from Scandinavia and Switzerland. 



Miss H. N. Wardle has cared for the collections during the year 

 and rearranged portions of the display, preparing a number of new 

 labels. 



Besides the material in the Vaux collection, the specimens in the 

 Gottschall collection from the Frazer and Thompson Rivers, B. C, 

 and from Washington, Oregon, Montana, and the Shasta tribes of 

 California, have been catalogued and displayed. 



A rearrangement of some of the cases has added much-needed 

 floor space and given uniformity of aspect.

Report of the Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections. 



During past year new cases have been purchased and installed, 

 under the supervision of the Curators of the Academy, for the 

 display of the archseological collection. 



There have been few accessions to the mineral collection, as it 

 has been considered advisable to defer any extensive purchases 

 until the completion of the contemplated rearrangement.
