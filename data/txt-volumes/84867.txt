January 6, ISH. 



The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Thirty-two members present. 



Dr. J. Gr. Hunt remai'ked that the structure of the Schizsea 

 pusilla differed widely from that of our other indigenous schiza- 

 ceous ferns, viz., Lygodium, palmatum, and its morphological ele- 

 ments are unlike those of our ferns in general. The barren frond 

 of Schizsea j^usiUa is marked on its epidermal surface with a 

 double line of stomata, and these organs extend the entire length 

 of the frond. The cells which make up the intex'ior of this delicate 

 fern are cylindrical and vary in size, but their distinctive cha- 

 racters lie in minute projections or outgrowths from all sides of 

 the cells, and these projections meet and are articulated with cor- 

 responding outgrowth from adjoining cells, so that the cells of 

 Schizsea have penetrating between them in every direction inter- 

 cellular spaces and channels of remarkable regularity and beauty, 

 and so characteristic is this plan of cell-union that the botanist 

 need find no difficulty in identifying the smallest fragment of the 

 plant. This morphological peculiarity has not been noticed 

 before. 



Dimorj)hous Flowers in Passiflora. — Mr. Thomas Meehan ex- 

 hibited some flowers of Passiflora quadra7igularis, in which some 

 of them had the pistils almost wanting, while the flowers were

perfect in all other particulars. A large plant running along a 

 rafter in his greenhouse, and producing huudreds of flowers, bore 

 these dimorphous ones in about equal proportions. He said it 

 was well known that in cultivation this plant never produced 

 fruit unless by artificial cross-impregnation, but he thought the 

 tendency to abort in the female flowers, and thus approach the 

 classes which were in structure as well as practically uni-sexual, 

 had not been noticed before. There was a species in New Zea- 

 land, however, known to be monoecious, and it might be just pos- 

 sible that the Passijioraceae, with raostl}^ hermaphrodite flowers, 

 were following in the wake of the allied Cucurbitaceae, in which 

 a complete separation of the sexes was the rule.

The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Twenty-six members present. 



Remarks on Hydra. — Prof. Leidy remarked that two species 

 of Hydra were common in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. 

 One is of a light brownish hue and is found on the under side of 

 stones and on aquatic plants in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, 

 and in ditches communicating with the same. Preserved in an 

 aquarium, after some days the animals will often elongate the 

 tentacula for several inches in length. The green ^?/<^?'a is found 

 in ponds and springs attached to aquatic plants. It has from six 

 to eight tentacles, which never elongate to the extent they do in 

 the brown Hydra. In winter the animal is frequently observed 

 with the male organs developed just below the head as a mamma- 

 like process on each side of the body. He had not been able to 

 satisfy himself that these Hydrae were different from H. fusca and 

 H. viridis of Europe. Prof. Agassiz had indicated similar colored 

 forms in Massachusetts and Connecticut, under the names of H. 

 carnea and H. gracilis. Of the former he remarks that it has 

 very short tentacles, and if this is correct under all circumstances, 

 it must be difl'erent from our brown Hydra, which can elongate its 

 arms for three inches or more.

The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Thirt}^ members present. 



Prof. E. D. Cope described some species of extinct tortoises 

 from certain formations of Northeastern Colorado, which had 

 been previously found in the Fort Union or lignite beds of the 

 ^Missouri river region by Dr. Ha3'den. He had in 1868 recognized 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



the age of the Latter as cretaceous, contrar}^ to the opinion ex- 

 pressed by some geologists, that the formation both in Dakota and 

 Colorado is tertiary. 



Mr. Cope incidentally mentioned the recent discovery of remains 

 of Dinosaurs in the lignite beds of Colorado, which were thus proved 

 to belong to the cretaceous period, and not tertiary, as the evi- 

 dence of the fossil plants had been interpreted by Mr. Lesquerenx 

 and others. 



Dr. LeConte expressed his great satisfaction at the complete 

 confirmation, b}' his friend Mr. Cope, of the statements he made 

 several 3'ears ago,* concerning the cretaceous age of the lignites at 

 the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, from near Denver 

 southwards into New Mexico. Dr. LeConte had discussed the 

 subject on page 19, and more fully on 65 and 66 of his report. 

 He had, it is true, expressed on page 65 a suspicion that the lig- 

 nites of the Missouri basin might be of raiocene age, but it would 

 be seen by the narrative part of the rejDort that Dr. LeConte had 

 not examined these beds personally, and their tertiary age was 

 assumed onl}- in deference to the very strongly expressed opinion 

 of Dr. Hayden, "the pioneer and most successful explorer 

 of the Missouri basin" (Report, page 53), who was the first, 

 as he has been the most persistent advocate of this view. 

 While admitting the similarity of the flora of these lignites to 

 those of known tertiar}' localities, he had insisted on the greater 

 value of the stratigraphical and zoological evidence by which they 

 were shown to be cretaceous. He referred Mr. Cope to this report, 

 that he might see how perfectly these recent discoveries accorded 

 with the previously expressed views, Avhich Mr. Cope had, perhaps 

 inadvertently', omitted to mention. 



Mr. Cope replied that he was quite familiar with the report of 

 Dr. LeConte, but did not consider stratigraphical evidence of 

 value as compared with palteontological in this instance, because 

 the beds display continuity of deposit from cretaceous to tertiary 

 (Hayden), while the fauna and flora exhibit an interruption. 



Prof. Frazer remarked that in this opinion Mr. Cope diftfered 

 from geologists generally, who regarded the weight of palteonto- 

 logical evidence as based entirely on our previous knowledge of 

 stratigraphical relations, and where the field was so new as our 

 Western territories, the evidences of palseontolog}^ as establishing 

 synchronism with the geological ages of Europe must be received 

 with great caution.

12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



January 27. 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 

 Thirty members present. 



Henr}^ A. Muhlenberg, of Reading, Pa., George De B. Keim, 

 Henry Tagg, Chas. S. Whelen, and Charles W. Macfarlane, were 

 elected members. 



Jas. Stevenson, U. S. Geol. Surv., was elected a Correspondent. 



Prof. Cope made some observations on the age of the lignite 

 and other corresponding formations of the West, and especially 

 its supposed equivalent in Northern Colorado. He referred to his 

 determination of the Upper Missouri formation as cretaceous in 

 1868 ; of the Wyoming Bitter Creek series as of the same age in 

 18T2. He now added the Colorado strata to the same, on the 

 evidence of vertebiate remains procured by himself during the 

 past season, in connection with the United States Geological 

 Surve}' under Dr. F. V. Hayden, These remains consisted of 

 Dinosauria of three species, tortoises of five, and a single species 

 of crocodile. Five of the genera were diagnostic. The Dinosauria 

 were referred to the old genus Maclrosaiirus and the new genera 

 Polyonax and Cionodon. The Gionodon arctatus was a large 

 herbivorous saurian, allied to Hadrosaurus^ but with a most com- 

 plex and singular type of dentition ; the size that of a horse. The 

 other, two species are much larger. 



He also ])ointed out that the tortoises are identical with species 

 discovered by Dr. Hayden in the Fort Union formation of Dakota. 

 He identified tlie Colorado beds with this group, and believed that 

 they are therefore of cretaceous age, stating that it was the first 

 time such identification had been made. 



Prof. Cope then discussed the age of the coal and lignite forma- 

 tions west of the Missouri River, and stated that Dr. Hayden had 

 divided them into several epochs, viz., the Placer Mountain (New 

 Mexico) ; CaRon Cit\' (Colorado) ; Fort Union (Dakota) ; and 

 Bear River (Wyoming); and that Mr, Meek and himself had re- 

 garded the Bitter Creek series as distinct from the others. He 

 stated that the stratigraphers and vegetable palaeontologists had 

 regarded all tliese beds as tertiary, but he believed that the animal 

 and especially the vertebrate palaeontology required their reference 

 to the cretaceous period. He observed that Mr. Meek had pointed 

 out the cretaceous age of the Bear River beds. LeConte had in- 

 sisted on the same reference for the CaRon City basin. Mr. King 

 and himself had determined that the Bitter Creek coal was creta- 

 ceous, and he had asserted that the Fort Union epoch belonged to 

 the same division of geologic time, in Dakota in 1869, and for 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

Colorado at the last meeting of the Academy, although LeConte 

 and others had regarded them as probably miocene.^ He stated, 

 moreover, that the evidence from palaeontology was discrepant, 

 and that it must be conceded that a tertiary flora was contempo- 

 rar}^ with a cretaceous fauna. He quoted Dr. Hayden as having 

 shown that there was no phj^sical interruption in the series of 

 deposits above enumerated, and that the incongruitj'^ iu the palfe- 

 ontology is to be regarded as CA^dence that no extinction or re- 

 creation of a general character had taken place during this time; 

 that the apparent interruption in the vertebrate life in the dis- 

 appearance of large land saurians and appearance of land mam- 

 malia is due to the irruption of the latter by migration probably 

 from the south. 



February 3. 

 The- President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 

 Eighteen members present. 



Dr. Chapman exhibited a dissection of 

 one of the hind legs of a muskrat. Fiber 

 zibethicus. The tendons of the tibialis 

 anticus (a), extensor proprius hallucis (6), 

 and extensor longus digitorum (c), pass 

 down a groove in the tibia and under a 

 little process of bone {d). The extensor 

 longus digitorum is held down by an 

 additional process {e). This arrangement 

 seems to quicken the extension of the foot, 

 and is of use apparently to the animal in 

 swimming:. 



Remarks on Protozoa. — Prof. Leidy re- 

 marked that while it was exceptional to 

 find the same species of the higher sub- 

 kingdoms in the different parts of the 

 world, it appeared to be the rule that 

 most species of Protozoa were found everywhere under the same 

 conditions. A large number of our fresh-water forms he had 

 recognized as the same as those described by European authors. 

 A less number of species are probably peculiar to every region. 

 Among our fresh-water i^/nzo/wtZs he had observed not only the 

 genera Amoeba., Arcella., Difflugia, Euglypha., Trinema, Lagynis, 

 Actinophrys, etc., but also most of the species of these as indi- 

 cated by European naturalists. 



• LeConte, Notes on Geol. Pacific E. E. Co., 1868, p. 65. 




14 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



Of the genus Arcella, A. vulgaris and A. dentata, with their 

 varieties, are common with us. In the genus Difflugio, the like- 

 ness of our species to those of Europe is striking. Besides D. 

 proteiforniis^ D. acuminata^ D. convpressa^ D. jnjriforynis, D. 

 aculeata, etc., he had observed the beautiful form described by the 

 English naturalist. Dr. Wallich, under the name of D. corona. 

 The shell of this species resembles a Roman helmet, with 

 from five to seven spines, and it has the mouth notched with 

 twelve serrations. A comparatively large species observed may 

 be peculiar, though future investigation may prove it to be only a 

 variety of i). lageniformis. The shell has the form of an ancient 

 amphora, without the handles, and it measures the fourth of a 

 line in length. With its delicate pseudopods of varied form, 

 and sometimes extending far beyond the length of the shell, it 

 appears as a microscopic vase of phantom plants. 



Among Amceba he had observed one which he suspected to be 

 the same as A. princeps of Ehreuberg, but it was twipe the size 

 given b}' this author. It was remarkable for its activit}'^ and 

 wonderful changes of form. At first globular, the next moment 

 pseudopods appear like a multitude of dewdrops all over the sur- 

 face. A few of these stream forth and widen in their course, 

 while others disappear. The animal will then extend itself and 

 appear like a branching coral. At one moment it will enter and 

 traverse the interstices of a mass of mud and sand, and then 

 emerge without an adherent particle. Detached and floating it 

 will appear like a long-rayed star. At times it assumes the most 

 grotesque forms — that of a human head with a rapidly growing 

 nose ; the outline of an elk with the antlers extending, or a leg 

 elongating at the expense of the body. The species is common 

 in the vicinity of Philadelphia. First observed in the neighbor- 

 hood of Swarthmore College, it was also found in the ditches of 

 the Neck below the cit3\ The animal contained a multitude of 

 minute particles of ellipsoidal form which reminded him of the 

 discoliths of the Bathyhius of Prof. Huxle}'. 



It is an interesting question whether our fresh-water protozoa 

 have reached us from the same sources as those of Europe and 

 other remote countries. If derived from the same sources they 

 were probably infused in the waters of the different continents at 

 an earl}'^ age when the latter were not separated by ocean barriers. 

 If thus earl}' infused we have a remarkable instance of a multi- 

 tude of specific forms retaining their identity through a long 

 period of time. Such a view might appear to oppose the 

 doctrine of evolution, but not justl}^ so, for the simplest forms 

 would be the slowest or least likely to vary, while the most com- 

 plex, from their extended relationships, would be most liable to 

 variation. Perhaps, however, the simplest forms of life, of the 

 same species, may have originated independently of one another, 

 not only in difierent places, but also at different times, and may 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



yet continue to do so. While tlie higliest forms of life ma}' have 

 been slowl}- evolved from the simplest forms of the remotest age, 

 equally simple forms may have started into existence at all times 

 down to the present period. From the later original forms new 

 ones may have been evolved to speed towards the same goal as 

 those which preceded them.

On the Mode of Groicth of Desmids. — Prof Leidy made some 

 remarks on the mode of reproduction and growth of the Desmids. 

 In illustration he described a common species of Docidium or 

 Pleural senium. This consists of a long cj'lindroid cell constricted 

 at the middle and slightly expanded each side of the constriction. 

 When the plant is about to duplicate itself, the cell-wall divides 

 transversely at the constriction. From the open end of each half 

 cell there protrudes a colorless mass of protoplasm defined by the 

 primordial utricle. The protrusions of the half-cells adhere to- 

 gether and continue to grow. The bands of endochrome now ex- 

 tend into the protrusions and subsequently keep pace with their 

 growth. The protrusions continue to grow until they acquire the 

 length and form of the half-cells from which they started. The 

 exterior of the new half-cells thus produced hardens or becomes 

 a cell-wall like that of the parent half-cells. In this condition 

 two individuals of Docidium are frequently observed before sepa- 

 ration. During the growth of the new half-cells the circulation 

 of granules in the colorless protoplasm is quite active. In a 

 species of Docidium H mrn. long by -^^ mm. broad, the growth of 

 the new half-cells was observed to be at the rate of about ^ mm. 

 in an hour.

Extract of a Letter relating to 3Iammalian Fossils in Califor- 

 nia Prof. Leidy read an extract from a letter recently received 



from Dr. Lorenzo G. Yates, of Centreville, Alameda County, 

 California, as follows : — • 



Yours of the 29th came to hand, and also a copy of your work, 

 " Contributions to the Extinct Vertebrate Fauna of the Western 

 Territories," for which accept ray thanks. Prof. E. O. Hovey's 

 statement in relation to the localities of some of the fossils, page 

 229, of the " Contributions," is incorrect. I discovered all the 

 fossils in a gravel deposit, which was evidently an old river 

 channel, in Livermore Valley, not from a " wash in the side of a 

 hill." 



The Bos latifrons, figs. 6, Y, plate xxviii. ; the Canis indianensis, 

 fig. 2, pi. xxxi. ; the Felis imperialis, fig. 3, pi. xxxi. ; and the 

 Auchenia hesterna, figs. 1-3, pi. xxxvii., together with the teeth 

 and bones of Elephas americanus, Equus, and the other bones 

 which I could not identify, were all discovered by me in that lo- 

 calit3\ 



Accompanying the letter was a newspaper slip of the discovery 

 of remains of Elephant and Mastodon in various localities, which 

 is here inserted. 



At a meeting of the Agassiz Institute at Sacramento, on the 

 17th of June, the following paper by Dr. L. G. Yates, of Centre- 

 ville, Alameda County, was read : — 



The interest taken within the last few years in the " antiquitj'' 

 of man" has invested the finding of the remains of the extuct 

 mammalia with a greater degree of interest than they would other- 

 wise receive, and the question is one which has b}"^ common consent 

 been admitted to be one of the most important which has been 

 raised of late years, consequently the discovery of the bones and 

 teeth of any of the larger animals, their geological location and 

 surroundings, is matter of interest to men of science and the ma- 

 jority of educated minds of all classes. 



Less than fifty years ago the discovery of the bones of a fossil 

 elephant, or other large animal, would have been looked upon as 

 evidence supporting some popular superstition in relation to giants 

 or tritons, and by some, less sceptical than the majority, they 

 would have been called a lusus naturaj, or, as the writer has heard 

 them pronounced within the last three or four j-ears, " peculiarly 

 formed rock," or "the bones of some common animal which has 

 grown in size since the animal died." But the majority of the 

 people of California at the present day are better informed on the ^ | 



subject, and admit the finding of remains of extinct animals of f ! 



size and form different from those now existing in temperate re- 

 gions ; yet, within the last two or three years, the writer remem- 

 bers having seen an item in one of our interior papers, giving an | 

 account of the finding of a " huge tibia," and giving it (on the 

 authority of some " Doctor") as the boue of a " human" or of 

 some other " upright walking animal." 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



But the principal object of the writer of this article, is to furnish 

 a list of localities of remains of fossil elephants and mastodons, 

 to which additions may be made from time to time. 



The writer, during a residence of eight years in California, has 

 spent considerable time in visiting locations where the fossils have 

 been discovered by others, and has succeeded in discovering a 

 number of localities not before known, where fragments of bones 

 and teeth, portions of skeletons, and, in some instances, whole 

 skeletons of the large pachyderms have been found, and has been 

 so fortunate as to discover the only new species, and, at the same 

 time, probabh' the oldest mastodon found on the Pacific Coast. 



List of Localities — Foiisil Elephas. 



Alameda County — No. 1. Near Mission San Jose, Elephas Ame- 



ricanus and E. ? Discovered by the writer in post pliocene 



detritus with Mastodon, Lama, Equus, Bos, and a large carnivore ; 

 upper molar deposited in Amherst College ; portion of lower jaw 

 with molar in Yale College, and portion of tusk in Wabash Col- 

 lege. 



No. 2. In Livermore Yalley, two large molars of Elephas Ame- 

 ricanus, discovered by the writer in post pliocene with Lama 

 California? Bos, Equus, Cervus, etc.; one molar in Wabash Col- 

 lege, the other in writer's collection. 



No. 3. Portion of tusk, from bed of a creek between Haywood 

 and Dublin, formerly in writer's cabinet, deposited in Wabash 

 College. 



Calaveras County. — No. 1. Near Murphy's, in auriferous gravel, 

 fragment of molar of Elephas Americanus, discovered by the 

 writer ; deposited in Yale College. 



Los Angelos County. — At San Pedro. 



Placer County. — No. 1. Near Forest Hill. 



No. 2. Near Michigan Blutf, in auriferous gravel. 



Solano County — No. 1. At Mare Island, molar. (W. P. Blake, 

 Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat. Science.) 



No. 2. Near Rio Yista, entire skeleton of Elephas Americanus, 

 about seven feet below the surface in clay. The party who dis- 

 covered it " went for it" with a pick, and with the assistance of 

 his neighbors, and by dint of perseverance and li;ird labor, they 

 succeeded in entirely destroying the bones, so that when the 

 writer visited the locality he found a large pile of small fragments, 

 and succeeded in obtaining casts of portion of the right side of lower 

 jaw with molar, and a portion of upper molar ; which, with three 

 or four vertebnne, comprised all that was taken, and they were so 

 broken that they had to be built up and partially restored in order 

 to get the casts. 



Fossil Mastodon, 



Alameda County. — No. 1. Near Mission San Jose, in post plio- 

 cene gravel, the writer discovered au almost entire lower jaw. 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



containina: five molars, and showing in a remarkable degree the 

 method of growth and replacement of the teeth; deposited in 

 Yale College. 



No. 2. Molar in bowlder of conglomerate, found in Alameda 

 Creek, and presented to writer; deposited in Yale College. 



Amador County. — Near Volcano, in auriferous gravel. Locality 

 visited. 



Calaveras County.— At Douglas Flat, near Murphy's. Locality 

 visited. 



Contra Costa Cou7ity.—No. 1. At Oak Springs, lower jaw entire 

 and upper molars of Mastodon obscurus, taken out of the base of 

 a pliocene hill by the writer; entire skeleton in the rock, but im- 

 possible to take it out; lower jaw and upper molar in Amherst 

 College; upper molar and fragment of tusk in Yale College. 



No. 2. Molar taken out of tunnel on the railroad between 

 Somersville and Pittsburg Landing. Locality visited. 



JEl Dorado County. — No. 1. At Grey's Flat, molars in recent 

 gravel deposit. Locality visited. 



No. 2. El Dorado Ranch, several molars and fragment. Lo- 

 cality visited. The "Doctor" who had them pronounced them 

 " Saurian teeth." The teeth had been broken up, and he called 

 each fragment (consisting of a cusp) an entire tooth, but on seeing 

 the pieces put together, and forming a large molar, he thought 

 " perhaps it might be so," but seemed loth to believe it, and re- 

 fused to part with even a fragment. 



No. 3. At Gold Hill, near Placerville. 



Mendocino County. — Localit}' unknown. 



Placer County On North Fork of American River, above 



Rattlesnake, in gravel. Locality visited. 



Santa Barbara County. — At Gaviota Pass. (Prof. J. D. Whit- 

 ney.) 



Stanislaus County. — On Dry Ci*eek, Mastodon Shepardi ; new 

 species discovered by the writer in pliocene sandstone, at the base 

 of a high perpendicular bluff; fragments of tusks in Amherst and 

 Yale Colleges. 



Solano County. — Near Benicia. Locality visited. 



Sonoma County. — Near Petaluma. Bones in recent deposit 

 near creek. Locality visited. 



Tuolumne County. — No. 1. At Texas Flat, in auriferous gravel. 

 Locality visited. 



No. 2. At Shaw's Flat, in auriferous gravel. Locality visited. 



No. 3. At Gold Springs, in auriferous gravel. Locality visited. 



No. 4. Under Table Mountain ? (Dr. Snell) in old river bed. 

 Locality visited. 



It will be seen that the majority of the localities given have 

 been visited by the writer. Particular attention has been given 

 to the formations and accompanying fossils, and search made for 

 evidences of the handiwork of man, but up to this time the writer 

 has failed to discover anything which would show conclusively

that mat! and either the mastodon or the fossil elephant were con- 

 temporaneous in this State. 



The stories of tlie finding of bones and teeth of fossil verte- 

 brates, by miners and persons not practical geologists, nor accus- 

 tomed to stud}' the geological whys and wherefores, and who do 

 not realize the necessity of close observation and discrimation of 

 the circumstances and surroundings of the relics, are not, in the 

 writer's opinion, entitled to much weight, and are very liable to 

 give false impressions ; for example, in a ravine in Alameda Coun- 

 ty, the writer found a human skull in the bank, some thirty feet 

 below the surface, and apparently in the same formation wliere he 

 had previousl}' discovered bones and teeth of Elephas, and after- 

 ward found a lower jaw of Mastodon and molar of Elephas, but 

 upon climbing to the top of the bank, the remaining portions of 

 the human skeleton were found some eighteen inches below the 

 surface in an old Indian burial ground or rancheria. It would 

 have been an easy matter to have labelled that skull as "found 

 with bones of Elephant and Mastodon," and passed it off as an- 

 other link in the chain of evidence of the contemporaneousness of 

 man and the extinct animals ; or the creek in the ravine might 

 have changed its bed and the human skull been covered up by 

 detritus in close proximity witli the mastodon jaw, and after 

 many j^ears discovered by some iuture fossil hunter, and the re- 

 mains of the two animals assigned, without question, to the same 

 age. 



One more example. Some four years since, a friend brought 

 me a remarkably well-preserved molar of a mastodon, imbedded 

 in a boAvlder of conglomerate, which he had found in Alameda 

 creek. Now, suppose that tooth, instead of being placed in the 

 writer's cabinet, had been carried by a freshet on to some gravel 

 bed along the creek, and the skull of some aborigine washed out 

 of the bank above (as they often do), or some of the stone imple- 

 ments sometimes found there had been deposited in the same place. 

 Perhaps in a few hundred years or less, some antiquarian or eth- 

 nologist finding these relics in the same gravel bed might at once 

 decide that they were of the same age, when in fact the mastodon 

 tooth washed out of a pliocene gravel bed, miles from where it 

 was found, and it may have been (and probably was) separated 

 from the other parts of the skeleton, and carried by the action of 

 water perhaps hundreds of miles before it was deposited in the 

 pliocene conglomerate; or, to carry the probabilities still further, 

 the mastodon might have lived in the miocene period, and the 

 tooth washed out of a miocene rock by a pliocene river, to where 

 it was again deposited, and afterward formed a part of the con- 

 glomerate bowlder in which it was found.

 emy, was announced.

Elevation of the Trunks of Trees. — Mr. Thomas MEEHA^f re- 

 ferred to remarks made on a former occasion — not communicating 

 anything new to science — but in regard to matter introduced into 

 a lawsuit, as to whether the trunks of trees would elongate after 

 once formed. He suggested that trees growing on a rock, by the 

 natural thickening of the roots beneath, would lift the tree four 

 inches in forty years, which covered the matter in dispute. 



Since that time, however. Dr. Lapham, the Botanist, and State 

 Geologist of Wisconsin, had called his attention to a force at 

 work in elevating the trees of that region, which he believes had 

 not before been recognized, and which he thought of interest suffi- 

 cient to merit a notice in the Academy's Proceedings. This was 

 that frost gradually lifted trees so that the trunk would sometimes 

 appear in time to have elongated a foot or more. 



Since Dr. Lapham had made the suggestions, he had examined 

 trees in the vicinity of Philadelphia and found unmistakable evi- 

 dence that large numbers of trees had been raised in the manner 

 stated. As was well known, most trees standing by themselves 

 had the collar of the tree of much greater diameter than the trunk 

 above; and the upper portions of the roots, springing from about 

 the collar, were considerably above the surface of the ground. 

 He had supposed, and he thought this was the impression of most 

 observers, that this arose merel}' from the annual deposition of 

 wood — the thickening upwards of the roots — but, on examination, 

 it could be seen in many cases that the axis, or original centre of 

 the root, once of course below the soil, was now above the surface. 



That this was caused by the action of frost was probable from 

 what we know of its action on vegetation by what is known 

 as " drawing out." When the land freezes, expansion ensues, 

 drawing the clover root up with it, leaving, of course, a cavity 

 from whence the root was drawn. When the first thaw came, the 

 liquid, carr^'ing earthy matter, entered the cavity; and thus the 

 clover root was prevented from descending to its original position. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 23 



It was as true of trees as of the clover plant. Roots elevated 

 found the cavities below partially filled, and could not thus per- 

 mit of the tree being quite as low as before. Dr. Lapham thought 

 that in the West large old trees blew over much more readily than 

 younger ones, though the comparative weight of head and roots 

 were proportionally the same, chiefly because the older trees had 

 been drawn nearer the surface. 



Mr. M. also remarked that the belief was very prevalent among 

 woodmen, that the numerous large roots which marked the sur- 

 face of an old piece of woodland " like railroads on a modern 

 map" were not originally near the top, but had grown to the sur- 

 face. He had always supposed these also to result from thicken- 

 ing, but he now had seen some cases in which this would not ac- 

 count for it, and only the frost-lifting power would. So, also, in 

 man}' swampy pieces of land, much of the vegetation had the 

 appearance of tussocks, and the land as if it had been washed 

 away from around the roots. It was not probably from annual 

 growths, but from gradual liftings of the plants from year to 

 year and the filling in of the spaces beneath by the soft mud. 



It was likely that one of the chief offices of the tap roots was 

 to guard the tree from this frost lifting as much as possible. His 

 impression was that the trees of tropical climates had not near 

 the development of tap roots which are found in the more northern 

 ones, but this was a matter for further investigation.

On Actinophry.s sol. — Prof. Leidy, after describing the structure 

 and habits of this curious rhizopod, said that he had recently 

 observed it in a condition which he had not seen described. He 

 had accidentally found two individuals including between them a 

 finely granular rayless sphere nearly as large as the animals them- 

 selves. These measured, independently of the rays, 0.064 mm. 

 in diameter; tlie included sphere 0.06 mm. He supposed that 

 he liad been so fortunate as to find two individuals of Actinoi)hrys 

 in conjunction with the production of an ovum. 




24 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Preserving the animals for observation, on returning after an 

 absence of tiiree hours, the animals were observed connected by 

 a broad isthmus including the granular sphere reduced to half 

 its original diameter. Two hours later the granular sphere had 

 melted^'in the isthmus, leaving behind what appeared to be a large 

 oil globule and half a dozen smaller ones. The isthmus in the 

 former time measured ^'5 mm., at the later time ^\ mm. 



Shortly afterwards, the isthmus elongated and contracted to 

 -g\ mm. on the left, while the right half, retaining the oil globules, 

 remained as thick as before. At the same time the animals be- 

 came flattened at the opposite poles. The latter subsequently 

 became depressed so that the animals assumed a reniform outline. 



The isthmus now more rapidly narrowed and elongated, became 

 a mere thread, and finally separated about one hour from the last 

 two hours indicated. 



The oil globules were retained in the right-hand individual, 

 which, with the remaining projection of the isthmus, appeared 

 broadly codiform in outline. In the left-hand individual all remains 

 of the isthmus at once disappeared, and the animal appeared reni- 

 form in outline, but now contracting on the same side it assumed 

 the buscuit form. The constriction rapidly increased, and in 

 thirty minutes from the time of separation from the right-hand 

 individual it divided into two separate animals presenting the or- 

 dinary appearance of A. sol. Thus this second division took 

 place in an opposite direction from the first. 



The right-hand individual, retaining the oil globules apparently 

 unchanged, more slowly assumed the reniform outline, and then 

 became constricted all around. The constriction elongated to an 

 isthmus, in the centre of which were the oil globules. Thi'ee 

 hours after the separation of the right-hand animal, the isthmus 

 was narrowed to about half the diameter of the two new indi- 

 viduals which were about to be formed. At this moment other 

 engagements obliged me to leave the examination of the animals. 

 Six hours after, in the animalcule cage, I observed only half a 

 dozen individuals of the A. sol.

REMARKS ON THE TERTIARY CLAY OF THE TIPPER AMAZON, WITH 

 DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SHELLS. 



BY T. A. CONRAD. 



Professor Eug. W. Hilgard has sent me for examination a 

 number of fossils collected on the Upper Amazon by Mr. Steere. 

 The extraordinary character of this interesting group has made it 

 one of more than ordinary attraction. The species and even 

 many of the genera being limited to these deposits, we fail to find 

 a point of comparison with other groups of fossils. Some natural- 

 ists have supposed from the look of freshness and the perfection 

 of many specimens, that they may be of comparatively modern 

 origin, but the clay in which they are imbedded is admirably 

 fitted for their indefinite preservation. The clay is generally free 

 from iron, and thus one source of injury is wanting. Tlie colors 

 of the shells are sometimes preserved in perfection, and even the 

 epidermis of a few specimens of Pachydon, and also portions of 

 cartilage, but I do not regard these as evidence of very late de- 

 position of the group. The colored markings of a cretaceous 

 Neritina from Mississippi, and on a univalve of the eocene of 

 Alabama, as well as portions of cartilage in an eocene bivalve, all 

 of which I have seen, might as well be considered evidence of late 

 tertiary deposition of the beds in which they occur. Were the 

 Pebas group of pliocene date, we should expect it to contain 

 many recent species of the Lower Amazon, and especially Azara, 

 but as far as we 3^et know, such shells are absent. Triquetra and 

 Hemisinus are characteristic genera of South American rivers, 

 but the fossil species are not identical with living ones. Mr. Dall 

 informs us that "many of the genera are exclusively marine," but 

 I am sure no such genus was in the collection which he studied at 

 the time. Only one doubtful genus of this character has been 

 found in all the collections since made. The fresh-water shells 

 consist of, 2 Anodontas, 2 of Hemisinus, and 2 of Triquetra, 

 besides several land shells, while the estuary genera, Mytilopsis 

 and Neretina, might have lived in either fresh or brackish water. 

 On the coasts of the Atlantic States of North America these two 

 genera live in the latter. The only shell which might be sup- 

 posed to be strictly marine is a Nuculana, if it prove to be a 

 3 




26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



species of that genus. So partial a view of the hinge has been 

 obtained that it cannot be certainly determined as indicating that 

 genus. The shell described as Tellina by Mr. Gabb is a young 

 valve of Pachydon tenuis. So that any certain evidence of a 

 marine origin for the Pebas group is wanting. 



Professor Woodward remarks that in the living analogue of 

 Pachydon, " Azara or Potamomya, we have just the evidence we 

 need to argue upon" in respect to the nature of the habitat of the 

 Pebas shells, and quotes Darwin's observations on Azara lahiata. 

 Darwin in his " Geological Observations on South America" saj's, 

 " On the northern bank of the great estuary of the Rio Plata, 

 near Moldonado, I found at the head of a lake, sometimes brack- 

 ish, but generally containing fresh water, a bed of muddy cla}' 

 containing Azara labiata,^^ etc. This representation of the habits 

 of that shell indicates, I think, those of the Pebas fossils, which 

 may have inhabited a lake similar to that of Moldonado. 



The following letter from Mr. Steere to Prof. Hilgard explains 

 the position of the fossils : — 



" I first saw Prof. Orton's fossil bed near Tabatinga. It is com- 

 posed of horizontal beds of blue clay, separated b}' beds of dirty 

 coal, that seems more like peat than coal. There seems to be 

 nothing regular in these beds, thus differing apparently in thick- 

 ness, and appeared in a distance of a few hundred yards. I have 

 sent you fossils from these different localities, Pebas, Old Pebas, 

 and Pichana. They are situated in relation to each other some- 

 what as follows : Pebas one mile from the mouth of the Ambyacii 

 River, and Old Pebas two miles below, and Pichana perhaps 

 fifteen miles from the mouth of the Ambyacii. The fossils from 

 Pebas are 60 or 70 feet above the river level, while at Old Pebas 

 they are at the water level, though the shell beds at Pebas may 

 extend down, as the lower strata are covered by fallen and washed 

 earth, leaving the fossil beds visible only at the top. The fossil beds 

 appear to have been denuded irregularly and then covered with a 

 bed of red and white clay and sand, much like that formed so 

 plentifully on the Lower Amazon in some places. This shows in 

 the river bank 30 feet thick, but at Pebas only 8 or 10. I made 

 a rough section of the exposed beds at Pebas, with the following 

 result — though the result I think is of little importance, the beds 

 change so frequently. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2t 



Pebas. 



8 feet red and white clay and sand. 

 20 feet blue clay, 4 feet of fossils. 

 6 inches coal. 

 15 blue clay. 3 feet of fossils. 



" I noticed that the lower strata had less univalves and more bi- 

 valves than the upper. I have sent you some shells that I know 

 are new, and bits of turtle shell, fish bones, coral, crustaceans, 

 etc., which have not been noticed in the bed before." 



I found no specimen of coral in this collection, nor in any other 

 of the Amazon fossils. 



Description of Shells of the Pebas Group. 

 PACHYDON, Gabb. 

 In this genus the species are very diverse in form, inequivalve, 

 both beaks directed forward, spiral ; the cardinal tooth of the left 

 valve is covered in front throughout two-thirds of its length by a 

 portion of the exterior la3'er of the valves, which is transversely 

 striated, and resembles a wedge sunk into the base of the lunule, 

 so as to define the tooth from the exterior when the valves are 

 closed. In most species the prominent margin of the lesser 

 valve fits into a groove, the lower margin of which is a well- 

 defined lateral tooth. This character is entirely wanting in CoR- 

 BULA, as well as the external view of the cardinal tooth. In P. 

 cuneata this character is strongly marked. Mr. Gabb's name for 

 this genus must be retained, because Stuchbury's Paghyodon, as 

 well as Schumacker's, are superseded. 



P. (Anisorhyncus 1) dispar, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 1. 



Yery oblique, subquadrangular, right valve concave above, with 

 2 diverging carinated lines from apex, one directed towards the 

 ventral extremit}', the other towards the anterior margin, left 

 valve profoundly ventricose, with a well-marked grooA-e anterior 

 to the beak, directed somewhat obliquely backward to the ventral 

 margin which is emarginate. The two outlines represent side 

 views of right valve. 



Six or seven specimens of this singular species are before me, 

 and I supposed the valves belonged to two diflerent species, so 

 ver}^ remote in appearance they are from each other; but one spe- 

 cimen, a cast, occurs with both valves represented in connection. 



\ 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



It would hardly have been thought a Corbula by those who insist 

 on the group being referred to that genus, if no other species of 

 Pachyodon had been found. 



P. erectus, Conrad. 



I have not the specimen originally figured, of this species, to 

 refer to, and cannot say positively whether P. alius, Conrad, is 

 identical with it. There is no form in the collection which would 

 represent P. erectus. 

 P. altus, Conrad, PI. I., figs. 4, IS. 



These represent the right or small valve of P. altus in its 

 young stage of growth. There are many specimens of this species 

 in the collection, but not one form which I could refer to the pre- 

 ceding species. 

 P. cuneata, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 3. 



This figure represents an unusual form of this shell, which 

 species is rare in the collection in comparison with P. tenuis, ob- 

 liqua, or erectus, about 10 specimens in all. 



Subgenus Anisorhykcus, Conrad. 



One valve of this subgenus occurs in the collection, the principal 

 distinctive character of which is the involution of the right valve. 

 What gives peculiar interest to this shell is that it is closely re- 

 lated to A. pyriformis, Meek, which lived among Unionidse in the 

 eocene of Utah, and the subgenus unknown in later tertiary de- 

 posits. This is another instance of the belated character of the 

 South American faunas, and favors the belief that the Pebas 

 group is not of late tertiary origin. 

 p. (Anisorhyncus) cuneiformis, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 19. 



Pyriforra, very inequilateral, ventricose anteriorl}', with the sub- 

 margin slightly convex, and the area before it depressed ; posterior 

 side elongated, somewhat sinuous or contracted, end acutelj- 

 rounded ; umbonal slope undefined. 



This description applies to only one right vah'e, which is all in 

 the collection. It is a moderately thick shell, and differs from 

 most species of Platyodon in wanting a prominent beak. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 29 



DRESSEINA, Vanbeneden. 



Subgenus Mytiloides, Conrad. Praxis, H. & A. Adams. 

 D. scripta, Conrad, PI. I., figs. 12, 16. 



Triangular, elevated, ventricose anteriorly, compressed towards 

 the posterior end ; umbo sharply angulated anteriorly, anterior 

 side flattened or concave; markings zigzag brown lines. 



This species much resembles D. polymorpha in its colored mark- 

 ings. It is a much smaller species than the latter, and pi-opor- 

 tionally shorter or more elevated. It is sufficiently abundant to 

 mark the estuary character of the bed in which the species lived. 



Figs. 12 are young shells showing extremes of variation in form. 



There is a small species of this subgenus living in the waters of 

 Virginia, among the oysters planted in brackish waters ; D. leuco- 

 pheeata, Conrad. (D. Americana, Recluz.) 



ANODONTA, Cuvier. 

 A. pebasana, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 5. 



Rhomboidal, elongated, compressed ; dorsal and ventral mar- 

 gins parallel; summit very small and acute, little prominent above 

 the hinge line, and erect ; distant from anterior end. 



A single valve of this species is before me. It is only remark- 

 able for its comparatively low elevation or height. There is a 

 fragment of a much larger species in the collection, which may be 

 A. Batesii, Woodward. The fragment I noticed as allied to Mul- 

 LERiA, Woodward states may be an Anodon, but the extraordinary 

 muscular impression renders that impossible. 



TRIQUETRA, Klein. HYRIA, Lam. 

 T.longula, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 10. 



Subrhomboidal, slightly ventricose, elongated, scarcely alated, 

 hinge and ventral margins nearly parallel ; anterior margin 

 slightly emarginate ; dorsal line convex, ventral margin nearly 

 straight ; umbonal slope rounded except on the umbo, where it 

 is subangular ; umbo flattened, with longitudinal and transverse 

 zigzag plications ; posterior margin obliquely truncated ; cardinal 

 teeth of right valve, four, the anterior one elongated and com- 

 pressed, rectilinear, two diverging teeth immediately under the 

 apex, and a much less elevated linear oblique tooth between two 

 anterior teeth ; in the left valve two very oblique divei-giug teeth 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



anterior to the beak, and two or three very small direct teeth 



under the beak. 



T. longula (Young), Conrad, PI. I., fig. 13. 



Rhomboidal, compressed, alated, anterior margin obliquely 

 rounded; umbo slightly convex, plicated, the plicfe similar to the 

 preceding, but the zigzag transverse ones wanting. 



There are only fragments of this shell before me, and there- 

 fore the outline must necessarily be conjectural. 



OSTOMYA, Conrad. 



Thin, concentrically plicated; hinge with a spoon-shaped ob- 

 lique fosset in the left valve, and a small tooth near the apex ; 

 right valve cartilage fosset very oblique, almost parallel with the 

 hinge line. 

 0. papyria, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 6. 



Subovate, inequilateral, compressed, very thin, concentrically 

 plicated, slightly sinuous anteriorly; ventral margin slightly 

 emarginate anteriorly ; umbonal slope undefined ; posterior end 

 subangular. 



A very rare shell, of the family Anatinidae. The fosset is very 

 large in proportion to the size of the shell. This form of hinge 

 would indicate a genus living in water more or less brackish. In 

 one specimen the apicial tooth is tuberculiform, in the others acute 

 with a slight channel anterior to it. 



NUCULANA ? Link. 



Plate I., fig. 2, represents the outline of a single specimen of a 

 shell having the form and somewhat similar hinge of Nuculana. 



PLANORBIS, Guettard. 

 P. Febasana, Conrad. 



Discoid, depressed ; volutions 3, convex, channelled along the 

 suture, glossy ; base concave, volutions rounded, separated by a 

 deep channel ; aperture round. 



Four or five specimens of this very small species were found in 

 a quantity of small shells and fragments of shells. They are as 

 fresh-looking as living species. If some of these Pebas fossils 

 were gathered, washed out of the clay on the shore of the Amazon, 

 the collection might include recent species of the vicinity. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 31 



PACHYTOMA, Swainsou. 

 P. tertiana, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 11. 



Pyramidaiiiical, volutions 5, flattened or concave laterally, cari- 

 nated at the suture and profoundly so at the sharp angle of the 

 base ; base slightly convex, subumbilicated, subcarinated behind 

 the depression ; basal margin slightly emarginate. 



A few specimens were found in the detritis. It is with some 

 doubt I refer it to Pachytoma, but I cannot compare it with any 

 other genus known to me. 



TOXOSOMA, Conrad. 



Conical, polished, the aperture projecting, subovate, direct, peri- 

 tome continuous; columella concave with a plait or tooth in the 

 middle, not oblique ; base rounded, subumbilicated. 

 T. eborea, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 7. 



Small, volutions 5, rounded; aperture angular above ; last volu- 

 tion expanded ; columellar tooth minute. 



Found in company with the preceding shell. It is probably a 

 land shell. 



CIRROBASIS, Conrad. 



Subcylindrical, with last volution free, aperture projecting, 

 peristome continuous, mouth narrow, subovate, oblique. 

 C. venusta, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 15. 



Elongated, volutions 9, very slightly convex, the last volution 

 straight on the side ; a few volutions near the apex with a cari- 

 nated line below the middle of each volution ; angle of base sub- 

 carinated. 



Only one specimen was found, and that in perfect preservation. 

 The genus is pi'obably terrestrial, allied to Cylindrella. 



LIOSOMA, Conrad. 



Conical, polished ; aperture subelliptical ; columella with one 

 plait in the middle ; base entire. 

 L. curta, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 8. 



Yolutions smooth, 4, slightly convex; columella conspicuously 

 cut or indented above the plait, which is not oblique. 




32 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



CYCLOCHEILA, Conrad. 



P3a-amidal, aperture circular, expanded labrum widely reflexed, 

 columella flattened, subangular at base. 

 C. Pebasana, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 17. 



Volutions 5, with straight sides ; last volution angular and 

 carinated on the angle; base flattened; spire and mouth of nearly 

 equal length, spire longest ; lines of growth oblique. 



HEMISINUS, Swaiuson. 

 H. Steerei, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 14. 



Turreted; volutions 6, convex, showing remains of 3 carina- 

 tions on each one of the spire ; last volutions having 4 revolving 

 carinated lines, the upper one near the suture ; sinus of labrum 

 deep. 



A single specimen occurs, much water-worn, almost obliterating 

 the carinated lines of the spire. 



EBORA, Courad. 

 E. crassilabra, Conrad, PI. I., fig. 9. 



JSfo'tes. — LiRis LAQUEATA, Courad, appears to me to be a land 

 shell allied to Cylindrella and Clausilia. There are, I think, 

 five genera of land shells and three of fresh water, with four 

 species of the latter. A few fragments of fish remains (Mylio- 

 bates) were determined by Prof. Leidy, and there is an impress in 

 the clay of nearly a whole crab. It is remarkable that no remains 

 of plants have been found where delicate fresh-water and land 

 shells have been drifted into these deposits. "We may expect to 

 find mammalian relics when the beds are more thoroughly ex- 

 plored, and they would be likely to indicate their geological age.

ON THE ANATOMY AND LINGUAL DENTITION OF ARIOLIMAX AND 

 OTHER PULMONATA. 



BY W. G. BINNEY. 



i have already, in connection with my friend Mr. T. Bland, 

 given a description of the external characters of Ariolimax (Ann. 

 N. Y. Lye, N. H. X. 291, I8t3). I now propose to describe 

 such of its internal organs as I have been able to study. 



I have examined one specimen of Ariolimax niger, J. G. Coop., 

 preserved in spirit, belonging to the state collection of California, 

 labelled and presented by Dr. Cooper, and in all respects an au- 

 thentic type. Agreeing with this type I have other specimens 

 from various California localities, so that I believe the species to 

 be well established and generally distributed along the coast of 

 California. 



From the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mr. 

 Anthony has sent me a specimen, long preserved in alcohol, 

 marked from San Mateo, California. For reasons given below, I 

 am inclined to consider this the form described by Dr. Cooper as 

 A. Californicus. I have had the opportunity of examining 

 another specimen of this form, received from Mr. Stearns, who 

 collected it near San Francisco. 



From Mr. Henry Hemphill I have received a specimen from 

 San Mateo Co., California, which presents most decided specific 

 differences from the last-mentioned form, especially in its geni- 

 talia. Having considered the last-mentioned form as A. Califor- 

 nicus, I am forced to consider this as A. Columbianus, the only 

 remaining described species. It must be borne in mind, however, 

 that I have never compared it with specimens from more northern 

 regions, whence the species was originally described. The large 

 number of specimens formerly preserved in the Smithsonian, tabu- 

 lated in Land and Fr. w. Shells, Part L p. 281, were destroyed at 

 the fire in Chicago, and I have been unable to obtain elsewhere 

 any specimens from Oregon or Washington Territory, which I 

 can refer to the true Columbianus. 



In treating these various forms, I have abstained from giving 

 an}^ description of their exterior markings. Such description 

 would be unreliable, as the specimens have been long preserved in 




34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



alcohol, and are evidently in various degrees of contraction. I 

 will say, however, that I found in all the blind sac under the 

 mouth (well marked, though not very deep), which is suspected 

 by Dr. Leidy to be the seat of the olfactory nerve. 



I can also here refer to several external characters not affected 

 or obliterated by contraction in alcohol. All the specimens have a 

 distinct locomotive disk to the foot. In all, the orifice of respi- 

 ration is decidedly posterior to the middle of the right margin of 

 the mantle. The position of the anus I found in A. Golumbianus 

 to be posterior and inferior to the respiratory orifice, with a 

 gutter-like groove to the edge of the mantle. The position of the 

 orifice of the generative organs is not so easily decided in alco- 

 holic specimens. I have no doubt, however, that in the living 

 animal it is under the mantle, not close behind the right tentacle. 

 In one form, Ariolimax Californicus, there are beyond doubt 

 two distinct orifices ; that of the male being smaller and anterior. 

 In Dr. Cooper's figure of A. Californicus (Proc. Phila. Ac. Nat. 

 Sc. 1873, pi. iii. f. D 3) the two orifices are plainly shown, and 

 suggested to me the identity of my specimens with his species, 

 especially as the external markings also agreed with his descrip- 

 tion. In A. Columbianus ? also there is no common duct or 

 cloaca, as Dr. Leidy calls it, to the genitalia, though I could not 

 detect more than one exterior orifice. In A. niger there can be 

 but one common orifice, judging from the penis entering into the 

 common cloaca, as shown in my fig. c of plate XI. 



The mantle is free on its margin in its whole circumference, espe- 

 cially in front and on its sides as far back as the respiratory orifice. 

 I could detect no concentric lines or other markings on the mantle. 

 The mantle was greatly produced and swollen on its margins in 

 Mr. Steam's specimen of A. Californicus. In that and all the 

 specimens examined I found an internal shell, varying somewhat 

 in thickness, but always well marked, calcareous, subhexagonal, 

 longer than wide. In the specimen of A. Golumbianus ? there 

 were decided concentric lines of growth on the shell, as will be 

 seen in my fig. G, plate II. 



The caudal mucus pore was plainly visible in all the specimens 



of ^. niger which I have examined. In fig. A of plate II. I have 



figured the pore of this species. It seems to be in two portions, 



.one erect, triangular, at the end of the body of the animal, with 



another running at right angles with it in a gutter-like excava- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 35 



tion towards the extreme end of the tail. In the form I have 

 referred to A. Columhiamis ? the pore was quite different from 

 this, as seen in my figure B of plate II. In this the erect portion 

 of the pore is entirely wanting, the carinated body being arched 

 regularly down to, and overhanging the foot. The longitudinal 

 gutter-like pore is, however, plainly visible. In the two specimens 

 of the form I have referred to A. Calif ornicus^ the body is also 

 arched down to, and overhangs, the foot. On the tail, corre- 

 sponding to the gutter-like pore of the last-mentioned form, there 

 ■was no sign of any pore, but in its place the flesh was sponge-like, 

 without the markings which are found on the neighboring por- 

 tions of the foot. It may be, therefore, that in these specimens 

 the mucous pore was contracted or closed. No doubt it exists in 

 the living animal. 



Of the internal anatomy I have examined the nervous system 

 in both A. Californicus and A. Columbianus ? The ganglia pre- 

 sent the usual three sets, all globular in form, and so crowded 

 together in the subcesophageal and superoesophageal as almost to 

 form a continuous chain around the buccal mass. 



In these same two forms, also, I have examined the circulatory 

 and respiratory organs. Within the respiratory cavity is a large, 

 spongy, ear-shaped organ, attached onl}' at one point to the roof 

 of the chamber. This, I suppose to be the renal organ, surround- 

 ing, and indeed inclosing, the heart, though it is not so arranged 

 in any of the genera described by Dr. Leidy. In Avion hortensis 

 he describes the nearest approach to such an arrangement. 



I have examined the digestive system of all the forms, and 

 figured that of both A. Californicus and Columbianus. In the 

 latter, plate II. fig. d, f, the buccal mass (1) is large and round, the 

 salivary glands (4) short and broad ; the stomach (5) long and 

 large, with a decided constriction at its middle, and the usual cul- 

 de-sac (6) at its extremity, at which point the biliary ducts (7, T) 

 enter ; from this the stomach passes into the intestine (8), which 

 proceeds first forward almost to the oesophagus, thence proceeds 

 backward to the extreme rear of the general cavity of the body, 

 and again forward to below the respiratory cavity, into which it 

 penetrates upwards as the rectum (9), and through which it 

 passes to the anus, whose position is described above. The intes- 

 tine in its whole course winds among, and is imbedded in, the 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



various lobes of the liver, which latter organ is arranged as usual 

 in Limax, Avion, etc. 



In A. Calif ornicus (plate ^I. fig. e), there is a difference in the 

 arrangement of the stomach. Before reaching the cul-de-sac (6), 

 the stomach is greatly constricted, and the cul-de-sac runs at 

 right angles with the stomach in an erect position, not lying on 

 its side as I have represented it, in order to show the connection 

 between it and the anterior portion of the stomach, which connec- 

 tion was entirely concealed by the cul-de-sac in its upright posi- 

 tion. The extreme length of the digestive system is three times 

 that of the whole body of the animal, at least in its contracted 

 state. 



The jaw in all the forms of Ariolimax is quite thick, dark horn- 

 colored, arcuate ; ends but little attenuated, blunt ; anterior surface 

 with stout ribs, denticulating either margin. I have figured the 

 jaw of A. Cohimbianus'? (plate II. fig. h) which has about twelve 

 ribs. In A. Calif ornicus^ from Mr. Anthony, there were thirteen 

 ribs to the jaw; fourteen in Mr. Hemphill's specimen of the same. 

 In A. niger Dr. Cooper describes about twenty, but in one spe- 

 cimen I found but eight. In Land and Fr. w. Shells, I. p. 280, I 

 have figured a jaw of the true northern form with eighteen ribs. 



The pouch of the lingual membrane is shown in plate II. fig. 

 D, 5. The membrane is as usual in the Helicidee, with tricuspid 

 central, bicuspid lateral, and quadrate marginal teeth showing 

 simply a modification of the laterals. In L. and Fr. w. Shells, I. 

 p. 280, I have figured the lingual membrane of the true northern 

 A. Columbianus. The marginal teeth are there shown to have 

 one long denticle and a small, subobsolete side denticle. This 

 form of marginal teeth I have found in the form I have referred 

 to A. Columhianus ? (see plate II. fig. e). Also in one of Dr. 

 Cooper's tj'pes of A. niger (plate XI. fig. a), and in both the spe- 

 cimens of A. Californicus (plate XI. fig. g). This form of mar- 

 ginal tooth may therefore be considered characteristic of the 

 genus, though in one specimen supposed to be A. niger, I noticed 

 marginal teeth with the outer cusp much more developed and 

 bifid, and figured them in Ann. Lye. N. H. N. Y., x. pi. xiii. fig. 1. 

 In plate XI. fig. b, I have given the central and the adjoining 

 lateral teeth of A. niger. In fig. r, the central and one adjoining 

 lateral of A. Californicus. 



There is no retractor muscle to the buccal mass in A. Calif or- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 37 



nicus and A. Columbianus ?, but a very stout, broad one to the 

 whole head, attached to the outer integument, below the buccal 

 mass, and running along some distance on the floor of the general 

 visceral cavity, to which finally it becomes attached. 



In describing the genital organs I have used the terras applied 

 to the various organs b}^ Dr. Leidy in the first volume of my 

 father's work on "The Terrestrial Mollusks of the United States." 

 Each form examined presented differences in these organs. They 

 all agree, however, in having a very large ovary. 



On opening the body of ^. niger (plate XI. fig. c), the genitalia 

 are found in the usual place, the testicle Ij'ing quite at the rear of 

 the visceral cavity near the extreme point of the upper lobes of 

 the liver, hardly imbedded in it, connected to the ovary by a long 

 epididymis (2). The testicle (1) is globular in form, composed 

 of black, aciniform caeca. It contrasts in color with the dirty 

 •white of the liver. Color, however, I have not found constant in 

 the internal organs of land shells preserved in spirits. The above 

 described arrangement of the testicle is as usual in Limax, Avion, 

 and other slugs. It forms an excellent specific character for A 

 niger, the position of the testicle being quite different in A. Gali- 

 fornicus and A. Columbianus ?, as will be seen below. The epi- 

 didymis (2) is long, convoluted at the end nearer the ovar}'. The 

 accessory gland is shown in 3. The ovar}^ (11) is large, 3'ellow- 

 ish. The oviduct (8) and prostate (4) show no unusual characters. 

 The genital bladder (9) is large, oval, with a short duct (16). 

 The penis is in a short, stout sac (5), which has a bulb-like swell- 

 ing at its upper exlremit}', where the vas deferens (7) enters. 

 The latter organ has nothing of peculiar interest. A vaginal 

 I")rostate, or perhaps dart sac, is shown in 13. The external ori- 

 fice is described above (p. 34). 



The genital system of A. Californicus is figured in d of plate 

 XI. The testicle does not lie far away, imbedded in, or resting 

 on, the upper lobes of the liver, but lies close against the ovary, 

 in the semicircle formed by the recurving of the apex of the 

 ovary upon itself. In this respect, the position of the testicle is 

 different from that of most slugs, and affords an excellent specific 

 character. The testicle (1) is kidney-shaped as it is covered by 

 its investing membrane. It appears to consist of closel}' bound 

 fasciculi of short, white, tubular, not aciniform caeca. The epi- 

 didymis (2) is short and still more shortened by its excessive 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



convolution. The accessory gland is shown in 3, partially imbedded 

 in the ovary. The ovary (11) is large and distinctly lobulated. 

 The oviduct (8) is narrow, very long, greatly convoluted. From 

 the testicle to about the middle of the course of the oviduct is a 

 stout thread-like organ, of unknown use to me, either a muscle, 

 nerve, or duct. It is not figured in my plate, as I am not certain 

 of its forming part of the genital system. The genital bladder 

 (9) is oval, large, with a short, stout duct (16). The penis is 

 inclosed in a long tapering sac (5), terminating in a decided fla- 

 gellum (15), in which I detected no capreolus. On the end of 

 the flagellum is a large, globular bulb. The retractor muscle of 

 the penis is attached to the roof of the general visceral cavity, 

 below the pulmonary chamber. It joins the penis at the com- 

 mencement of the flagellum. The vas deferens (7) is peculiar. 

 It leaves the prostate gland (4) as usual, runs alongside of the 

 vagina to the base of the penis, thence runs upwards, swelling to 

 an enormous extent, so as to equal the breadth of the penis, then 

 again becomes gradually reduced to its former size until, as the 

 most delicate thread, it enters the penis at the end of the flagellum 

 below the bulb. The penis did not appear in the animal extended 

 as drawn in the plate, but was twice recurved upon itself. There 

 is also a vaginal prostate (13), large, ear-shaped, close to the 

 exterior orifice of the female organs, which, with that of the male, 

 is described above (p. 34). 



On plate II. fig. c, I have figured the genitalia of A. Golumhi- 

 anusf which also has a very large ovary (11) against which the 

 testicle (1) lies as in the preceding form. The ovary is so large 

 as to take up one-half of the entire visceral cavity, extending 

 completely across the body, resting on the floor of the cavity, its 

 ends recurved upwards so as to rest upon the liver on the upper 

 surface of the viscera. The body of the animal externally is 

 swollen by the large size of the ovary. The oviduct (8) is narrow, 

 long, greatly convoluted, ending in an extremely long, convoluted 

 vagina. The genital bladder (9) is oval, large, with a short, stout 

 duct (16). The vas deferens (1) unlike that of the pi-eceding 

 form, is as usual in the land shells. It enters the penis (5) at its 

 summit, opposite the retractor muscle (6). The sac of the penis 

 is very stout, long, cylindrical. The external orifice is described 

 above (p. 34). 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



Zonites Isevigatus, Pfr., pi. III., fig i. 



I have examined numerous specimens, but have some hesitation 

 in giving mj^ figure and description as absolutelj' perfect. I had 

 great difficulty in dissecting the species. 



The ovary is short and vagina long. The genital bladder with 

 its duct forms a short cylindrical sac-like organ, opening near the 

 base of the vagina, and tapering at the apex. The penis sac is 

 long, cj'lindrical, larger at its apex where it receives the vas de- 

 ferens. At its base the penis sac has its opening into the vagina 

 with a short stout organ (fig. 13) with i-ounded apex, where a re- 

 tractor muscle seems to be attached. This organ may be a dart 

 sac or some form of prostate gland. 

 Hemphillia glandulosa, BI. and Binn., pi. III., fig. v. ti. 



The testicle is composed of a large globular mass of aciniform 

 caeca. It lies loosely upon, not imbedded in, the upper lobes of 

 the livei-. The ovary and oviduct are as usual. The genital 

 bladder is globular, very large, on a short stout duct, entering the 

 vagina near its base. The penis sac is long, cylindrical, larger 

 towards its apex, where both the retractor muscle and vas de- 

 ferens enter. 



In several specimens examined, the penis sac appeared some- 

 what diflTerent. It had a large globular bulb (5a) at its apex. 

 The vas deferens (*7) entered beyond the middle of the length of 

 the sac (5) ; it was greatly swollen (56) before entering the sac, 

 for a distance equalling about one-half of the length of the sac. 

 At the commencement of this swelling the retractor muscle (6) 

 was inserted. This form of penis sac is figured in fig. vi. 



The balance of the anatomy of Hemphillia seems to be as in 

 the other slugs. 



Helix Kelletti, Forbes (Arioiita), pi. III., fig. iv. The Catalina Island form. 



The ovary is light yellow. The oviduct is white. The genital 

 bladder is light yellow. The prostate is large and j-ellow. 



The whole genital system is long and narrow. The genital 

 bladder is small, globular, on an extremely long and delicate duct 

 which enters the vagina at its upper end. The duct just below 

 the bladder receives a branch duct, vevy long, flagellate, three 

 times the diameter of the duct itself. The penis sac is long, stout, 

 cjdindrical, tapering towards its apex and prolonged into a very 

 long delicate flagellum. The vas deferens enters at the point 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



where the flagellum commences. The retractor muscle is inserted 

 half way between the vagina and the entrance of the vas deferens. 

 Opposite the mouth of the penis sac is a small sac-like organ, 

 probably a dart sac or vaginal prostate. 

 Helix Mitchelliana, Lea {Mesodon), pi. III., fig. m. 



The genital system is long and narrow. The oviduct is greatly 

 convoluted. The penis sac is long, stout, cylindrical, with a bulb- 

 like expansion at its apex, at which point both vas deferens and 

 retractor muscle are inserted. The genital bladder is lengthened, 

 ovate, not much larger than its duct, which is short, and enters 

 the vagina below the middle of its length. 

 Helix reticulata, Pfr. (Arionta), pi. III., fig. ii. 



The specimens examined have a very globose shell. The ovary 

 is brownish below, yellowish above. The epididj^mis and testicle 

 are salmon colored. The oviduct is white, the prostate salmon. 

 The genital bladder is small, oval, with an extremely long duct, 

 which has a flagellate branch. The duct enters at the lower end 

 of the vagina. The penis is narrow, cylindrical, extremely long, 

 with a flagellate extension. The retractor muscle is inserted be- 

 yond the middle of the length of the penis, the vas deferens at 

 the commencement of the flagellum. There is a stout long cylin- 

 drical vaginal prostate, whose apex is extended into a flagellum, 

 which shortly becomes bifurcate, there being a bulb-like expansion 

 on each branch just beyond the bifurcation. 



In some individuals the bulb-like expansions are still larger and 

 stouter than in the figure. The cylindrical extension of the va- 

 ginal prostate is abruptly truncated, the two flagella entering near 

 the end, not at the extreme terminus. 



Helix Koemeri, Pfr. {Mesodon) . 



The genitalia are figured on pi. IV., fig. v. The oviduct is 

 scarcely convoluted. The genital bladder is large, oval, with a 

 long, large duct. The penis sac is short, stout, of about equal 

 breadth throughout, ending in a stout oval bulb, into which the 

 vas deferens enters. The retractor muscle is inserted above the 

 entrance of the vas deferens. 



The specimen examined was collected in Bosque Count}', Texas, 

 by Mr. Hugo W. Ericsson. 

 Helix appressa, Say ( Triodopsis) . 



The genitalia are figured on pi. IV., fig. iv. The ovary is long

and narrow. The epididymis is very long, convoluted at the end 

 nearer the oviduct. The last-named organ is not much convoluted. 

 The prostate is scalloped along its edges. The genital bladder is 

 globular, small, with a long, small duct. The sac of the penis is 

 extremel}' long, ribbon-like, one and one-half as long as the ovi- 

 duct. The vas deferens enters its apex. 



The long ribbon-like sac of the penis resembles that figured by 

 Dr. Leidy (Terr. Moll. U. S. I.), of H. Sayii. There is but little 

 resemblance to the genitalia of H. imlliata, so nearly allied by its 

 shell. 



The specimens examined were collected in eastern Tennessee, 

 by Miss Law. 

 Helix Nickliniana, Lea (AHonta). 



The genitalia are figured on plate IV. fig. iii. The ovary is yel- 

 low, long, narrow, concave on one side, convex and carinated on the 

 other. The accessor}'^ gland of the epididymis is composed of long, 

 white caeca. The oviduct is extremely long, narrow, convoluted. 

 The genital bladder is globular, small, with an extremely long 

 duct, to which is added an accessory duct or branch, almost as long 

 as the oviduct. This branch joins the duct near its end. It is 

 thicker than the duct. The duct enters the vagina at its upper 

 part. The penis sac is long, cylindrical, small, almost equalling 

 in length the oviduct and ovary united. The retractor muscle is 

 inserted at about the middle of its length, it is attached to the dia- 

 phragm ; the vas deferens enters about three-fourths of its length; 

 beyond the vas deferens is a flagellate extension. The vagina is 

 long and narrow ; near its base, opposite the entrance of the sac 

 of the penis is a stout, cylindrical, long, hollow, vaginal prostate, 

 gradually tapering at its apex, and extended into a delicate tube, 

 which soon becomes divided into two long flagella. Just beyond 

 the division, on each flagellum, is a stout bulb-like enlargement. 



This complicated form of genitalia, hitherto unnoticed in Ame- 

 rican species, has been noticed in European species. 



Patula strigosa, Gould, pi. IV., fig. ii. 



Represents the genitalia of a Salmon River specimen. The 

 testicle, as usual, was in the summit of the upper lobe of the liver. 

 Tlie epididymis is long, convoluted in its half nearer the testicle. 

 The accessory gland is composed of several long, black cffica. 

 The oviduct is sac-like, not convoluted, containing eight embryonic

shells. The genital bladder is long, with a long, narrow duct en- 

 tering the upper part»of the vagina. The vagina is short and 

 swollen. The penis sac is long, stout, blunt at apex, where the 

 retractor muscle is inserted. The vas deferens becomes greatly 

 swollen before it enters the sac of the penis, which it does above 

 the insertion of the retractor muscle. 



As the shells of some forms of this species are difficult to dis- 

 tinguish from some forms of Patula solifaria, it is interesting to 

 state that the genitalia of a specimen of the latter from the same 

 locality, offer very distinct specific characteristics, agreeing with 

 Dr. Leidy's figure in Terr. Moll. U. S. I. 

 Macrocyclis Vancouverensis, Lea. 



The genitalia are figured on pi. IV., fig. i. The epididymis is 

 extremely long and very large, forming the peculiar feature of the 

 system. The genital bladder is oval, with a long duct, which is 

 very much broader at the end nearer the vagina. The penis sac is 

 long, gradually tapering at its apex, where it receives the vas de- 

 ferens. Upon the side of the vagina, about the middle of its 

 length, is a wart-like protuberance, which may be a dart sac or a 

 vaginal prostate. 



A comparison of Dr. Leidj^'s figure of the genitalia of 31. con- 

 cava in Terr. Moll. U. S. I. shows considerable difference between 

 the two species, especially in the epididymis. 

 Zonites demissus, Binney. 



The genitalia are like those of Z. iutey'texlus, Binney, figured by 

 Dr. Leidy (Terr. Moll. U. S. I.). The accessory glands of the 

 dart sac are rather shorter in demissus. 

 Amphibulima appendiculata, Pfr. 



Elsewhere (Ann. Lye. Nat. Hist., N. Y. x. 206, pi. ix. f 2, 6, 9, 

 11) we have fully described the external appearance, jaw, lingual 

 membrane, and shell of this species, pointing out its differences 

 from Succinea^ from Pellicula, from Omaloni/x, and all other de- 

 scribed genera. 



I now give (pi. VIII. fig. 5) a figure of its genital system, with 

 notes on other organs, drawn from specimens in alcohol. 



The external orifice of generation is beliind the right eyepedun- 

 cle. The orifice of respiration is on the right mai'gin of the man- 

 tle, slightly to the rear of its middle. There is a distinct locomo- 

 tive disk to the foot. The eyeped uncles must be short and stout. 

 The digestive and nervous systems present no reir.arkabl^/eature. 



i 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



The suboesophageal ganglia consist apparently of six closely 

 agglomerated globules. There are two simple globules to the 

 stomacogastric ganglia. The genital system (pl.VIII. fig. 5) is quite 

 simple, presenting no accessory organs. The testicle is composed 

 of six or seven fasciculi of long cjBca, which massed together in a 

 globular form equal the length of the oviduct. This enormous 

 development of the testicle is the peculiarity of the genital sys- 

 tem, and no doubt will prove a reliable specific, but not generic, 

 character. The epididymis is long, convoluted at its middle por- 

 tion. The oviduct is long, narrow, not convoluted. The vagina 

 is about one-fifth the length of the oviduct; it is swollen greatly'- 

 at the entrance of the penis. The genital bladder is small, glo- 

 bular ; its duct is narrow, longer than the oviduct, and enters the 

 vagina at the upper fourth of its length. The penis sac is short, 

 stout, blunt at apex, where the vas deferens enters and where the 

 retractor muscle is also inserted. 



In the paper referred to above we hesitated to decide upon the 

 generic position of this species, leaving it temporarily in Pellicula 

 of Fischer (not of Heynemann, which is Omalynx). Since that 

 time I have become acquainted with the jaw of Amphibulijna, and 

 find it to be of the same tj'pe as in appendiculata. I would, there- 

 fore, suggest that this species belongs to Amphibulima. It is true 

 its lingual dentition (see pi. VIII. fig. 6) more closely resembles that 

 of Simpulopsis sulculosa as far as centrals, and perhaps laterals, 

 are concerned ; but in the marginals, as described in S. sulculosa 

 and S. Portoricensis^ the resemblance ceases. Moreover, the jaw 

 of Simpulopsis is described as quite different by Shuttleworth. The 

 species under consideration cannot, therefore, be placed in Sim- 

 pulopsis. It appears, at all events, that the shell in this group is 

 an unreliable guide to generic position. 



It must be borne in mind that I here describe the anatomy of 

 the shell figured b}'' us (I.e.). We believe it to be Succinea ap- 

 pendiculata^ Pfr. Fischer bases his genus Pellicula on Succinea 

 depressa, Rang. He does, indeed, place S. appendiculata, Pfr., in 

 the sj'nonj^my of his species, but our specimens of appendiculata 

 could never be the same as Fischer's specimens of dej^ressa. His 

 had a jaw with nine decided ribs, denticulating the cutting edge, 

 and teeth^ of the usual form of Helicinse., quite ditferent from what 



• In Fischer's plate the references to teeth of Omalonyx unguis and Pel- 

 licula depressa are reversed. 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



we find in our S. ajjpe^idiculata. His species and ouvs are there- 

 fore distinct. 



Pellicula convexa, Martens (Succinea), is quite a distinct species, 

 and belongs to the genus Omalo7ujx, as shown by Heyneniann's 

 figure of the jaw (Mai. Blatt., xv.). 



I give also figures of the central and lateral teeth of our species 

 (pi. yill.,fig. 6). 

 AmpMbulima patula, Brug. 



I have elsewhere described, in connection with Mr. Bland, the 

 jaw and lingual membrane of specimens of this species from St.Kitts 

 and Dominica (Am. Journ. of Conch., VII. 186, pi. xvii., f. 1, 2; 

 Ann. Lye. N. H. and N. Y., x. 225, pi. xi., f. 8). Lately the question 

 of identity of these shells with the Guadeloupe |)a<i<Za has been 

 raised (see Journal de Conchyliologie, XXI. 12). I have, therefore, 

 again carefully examined the lingual membranes previously de- 

 scribed to learn if they give any diflference worthy to be considered 

 of specific value. I have figured teeth from each lingual mem- 

 brane (pi. VII.). I regret not having had the opportunity of exam- 

 ining Guadeloupe specimens also, but have never been able to 

 receive the latter with the animal ; indeed it seems to be now 

 found subfossil only. I can only treat the question of the identity 

 of the St. Kitts and Dominica forms, not their identitj^ with Guade- 

 loupe forms. 



It will be seen that the Dominica form has sharper cutting 

 points to the large cusps of its central and lateral teeth than that 

 of St. Kitts. Fig. B shows a group of laterals of the former, in 

 which some variation from the pointed shape is indeed shown, but 

 no decided tendency that way. On the other hand, the laterals, 

 from the St. Kitts form, show great constancy in the square trun- 

 cation of the cutting points. 



The teeth of the St. Kitts form are broader in proportion to 

 their length than those of Dominica, have a greater curve in their 

 outlines, and more developed side cusps, which overlap the me- 

 dian cusps. 



The Dominica lingual in the only row counted had St-l-BT 

 teeth. A row of the St. Kitts form 5*7-1-57. The marginal teeth 

 of the St. Kitts form show a greater tendency to splitting into 

 sharp denticles on the cutting cusps than those of Dominica. 



It cannot be denied that certain variations may be noticed in 

 the two lingual membranes. I believe, however, that these differ- 



k 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 45 



ences are not such as suggest specific distinction, especially as the 

 shell furnishes no grounds for doubting the specific identity of the 

 forms. Nor by the shell alone does there seem to be two species. 



Mr. Bland has given a detailed account of the species in Journal 

 de Conchyliologie, XXI. 342, October, ISIS. 

 Amphibulima rubescens, Desh. 



Mr. Bland and myself are indebted to Governor Rawson for 

 specimens preserved in spirits of Succinea rubescens, Fer. of 

 Martinique. 



On examination of the jaw and lingual membrane, I found 

 the species to be no Succinea, but an Amphibulima, in which 

 genus it is placed by H. and A. Adams (Gen. Rec. Moll.), and by 

 Beck (Index), though Pfeiffer treats it as a Succinea, and von 

 Martens catalogues it in Succinea, s. str. (See note 1 to p. 345 

 of Journ. de Conch., Oct. 1873, 3d series, XIII.) 



The external appearance, of the animal has nothing peculiar. 

 The head appears blunt and short, the tail long and pointed, 

 without any mucus pore. There is no distinctly marked loco- 

 motive disk to the foot, over the whole breadth of which the 

 transverse muscles pass. The reticulations of the surface of the 

 animal seem large and coarse in proportion to its size. As far 

 as can be judged from alcoholic specimens, the tentacles and eye- 

 peduncles seem short and stout. The respiratory and anal orifices 

 are under the mantle on the right side. The external orifice of 

 generation is behind the right eyepeduncle. 



On opening the animal from above, the generative system is 

 found as usual, lying on the right of the animal. It occupies the 

 whole of the visceral cavity in front of the shell, lying upon the 

 stomach. The testicle (see plate VIII., fig. 4) is a globular mass 

 composed of long c^eca. It lies imbedded in the liver. The epidi- 

 dymis is not greatly convoluted. It passes between the stomach 

 and intestine, at the cul-de-sac of the former, on its way to the 

 ovary. The latter organ is, as usual, tongue-shaped. The ovi- 

 duct is long and greatly convoluted. The vagina is short, 

 receiving at its lower portion the long duct of the small, globular 

 genital bladder. The penis enters the vagina close to the common 

 opening. The sac of the penis is not long, is stout, cylindrical, 

 blunt at apex, where it receives the vas deferens, just above the 

 insertion of the retractor muscle. There are no accessory organs. 

 The genital system is very much the same in its general arrange- 




46 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



ment as that of Amphihulima appendicidata, Pfr. (see fig. 5), but 

 differs among other things in wanting the huge testicle of that 

 species. 



The digestive sj^stem presents no peculiar characters. The 

 stomach is long, narrow, and ribbon-shaped, lying under the 

 genital S3'stera and extending backward as far as the shell when 

 the animal is extended. At this point the stomach forms the 

 usual cul-de-sac at its junction with the intestine. The last organ 

 and the liver are small in proportion, as would be antici])ated 

 from the short spire of the shell ; the liver is dark blue. There 

 seems to be a retractor muscle to the whole head rather than to 

 the buccal mass. It lies on the floor of the cavitv- The buccal 

 mass is large, the oesophagus small. The salivary glands and 

 ducts, and pouch of the lingual membrane are as usual. The jaw- 

 is readily detached from the muscles of the mouth, and is not 

 connected with the lingual membrane as usual with our Helices.^ 

 It is thin, wide, low, arched, with attenuated, bluntly pointed 

 ends ; divided by numerous (about 63) delicate ribs into separate 

 plate-like divisions, as in the jaw of CylindreUa^ Bulimulus, etc., 

 the ribs running somewhat obliquely towards the centre of the 

 jaw ; there is no decided, upper median, triangular plate (fig. 2, 

 plate VIII.). The lingual membrane (plate VII., fig. 3) is long, 

 broad, composed of numerous rows of 16-1-16 teeth. Centrals 

 long, narrow, expanding below with the lower margin squarely 

 excavated as in Succinea ; tricuspid, the central cusp ver^' long, 

 wide, with a greatly expanded, squarely truncated cutting point 

 reaching beyond the lower margin of the tooth; the side cusps 

 short and narrow, simply pointed. The lateral teeth are of same 

 type as the centrals, but unsymmetrical and bicuspid. The mar- 

 ginals are a simple modification of the laterals, with a long, 

 bluntly truncated median cusp, and obsolete side cusps. The 

 extreme marginals are irregularly denticulated, the outer and inner 

 denticles being more produced, especiall}' the outer, and greatl}'- 

 curA-ed ; the inner denticles, usually two in number, are quite 

 small. 



The jaw agrees perfectly with that of the genus Amphihulima 

 described by us. (Ann. Lye. N. H. of N. Y., x. p. 223, pi. xi. 



' Even after boiling the whole buccal mass in potash, the lingual mem- 

 brane and jaw remain attached in most of our Helices of N. A. showing a 

 decided connection between the two.

fig. 8.) The lingual membrane has also the same general arrange- 

 ment as in that genus, with specific differences from that of A. 

 paf.ida (see plate VII., fig. a-c), especially in the widely expanded, 

 blunt median cusp, and in the Succinea-Yike cutting away of the 

 lower margin of the teeth. 



The nervous ganglia are as usual in the Geophila, forming a 

 continuous ring in the supraoesophageal, and grouped together in 

 one mass in the subcesophageal set, 



Plate VIII., fig. 3, gives the central and adjacent lateral teeth, 

 with marginals at different intervals to the edge of the membrane. 



The notes we have given above will enable a full generic descrip- 

 tion of the genus Amphihulima to be drawn. 



Gonospira aijid Nanina, from Mauritius. 



Having received from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at 

 Cambridge a number of specimens in alcohol of Mauritius species, 

 collected b^^ Consul Pike, we are able to give the following notes 

 on them. 



Go)wspira. There were several species of this and the allied 

 subgenera, allowing an examination of tlieir anatomy. The soft 

 parts of the animals are colored red. The species especially 

 examined are G. Newtoni, H. Ad., and G. palanga, Fer. There 

 seems nothing in the anatomj' different from what is usual in the 

 land shells. The genitalia of G. Neivfoni are figured on plate VIII., 

 fig. 7. There are no accessory organs. The genital bladder is 

 long, oval, with a long, narrow duct. The penis sac is stout, long, 

 receiving the vas deferens at its summit, at which point, also, the 

 retractor muscle is inserted. The vagina is long, the oviduct not 

 convoluted. The ovary tongue-shaped as usual. The epididymis 

 is short, the testicle as usual lies in the liver. 



G. palanga has a similar genital system. There appears no 

 locomotive disk and no caudal pore. 



The lingual membrane of the genus has been photographed by 

 Mr. Bland and myself (Am. Journ. of Couch., v. pi. xi. fig. 1). 

 All the species now received have similar dentition. There is, 

 however, a difference in the number of teeth in each transverse 

 row. I counted about 37-1-37 in palanga; 6-1-6 in G. Neivtoni; 

 12-1-12 in G. mauritiana, Morelet ; 25-1-25 in G. modiolus, Fer. 

 (Gibbulina, v. Martens). The dentition of this species is also 

 described by Semper (Nachr. Mai. Ges., II. 103). 21-1-21 in G. 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Nevilli. We have elsewhere described the dentition of G. sulcata, 

 Miill. (Ann. N. Y. Lye. N. H., x. 222). 



No jaw was found in any of the above, nor in Ennea clavulata, 

 Lam This last species is placed in s. g. Gulella by von Martens. 

 There were five embryonic shells in the oviduct, proving the 

 species to be viviparous. The dentition is the same as in Gonos- 

 pira. There appears to be a median tooth of same form as the 

 laterals. 



Of the genus Nanina (using the name in the same sense as von 

 Martens in die Heliceen), there were several species. All have the 

 locomotive disk, the caudal pore with overhanging horn-like projec- 

 tion, the smooth jaw with median projection, and the lingual denti- 

 tion of the genus, i. e., centrals tricuspid, laterals bicuspid, mar- 

 ginals aculeate, bluntly bifid. Such are N. Caldioelli, Benson; N. 

 Baivsonis, Barclay = semicerina, Morelet ; N. argentea, Rve. ; N. 

 implicata, Nevill ; N. stylodon, Pfr., put in Helix {Erepta) by von 

 Martens. Entirel}^ different in the dentition is another species, N. 

 philyrina, Morelet, though the species agrees in other respects witli 

 the above-named. The membrane is very broad, the teeth exceed- 

 ingly numerous, arranged in oblique rows. The centrals, which 

 I am confident of having seen, are small, narrow, high. The other 

 teeth are the same in form to the edge of the membrane. They 

 appear to have the usual aculeate form of the marginal teeth in 

 Nanina, but instead of narrowing towards the cutting point, they 

 are broadly and obliquely truncated, reflected, and minutely den- 

 ticulated. This lingual membrane is also figured bj'' Semper (Phil. 

 Archip., pi. vi. f. 35), but his figures give more the impression of 

 the usual Nanina marginals with denticulated side and bifid points. 

 The teeth are, however, so exceedingly numerous and small, it is 

 very difficult to understand them. 



Elsewhere (Ann. N. Y. Lye. N. H., x. 1*70) we have described 

 the lingual of the following Mauritius species : Nanina inversi- 

 color, leiicostyla, rufizonata, militaris. I have examined the geni- 

 talia of N. inversicolor. The oviduct is long, narrow, sac-like ; 

 the genital bladder is hardly smaller than its long wide duct ; the 

 penis sac is long, extended into a flagellum, receiving the vas 

 deferens near its apex, bej'ond it having a bulb-like termination ; 

 the vas deferens is greatly swollen at its middle portion, and near 

 the base of the oviduct has a long flagellate appendix.

 Bulimulus chrysalis, Pfr. 



Martinique. Gov. Rawson. 



Jaw of the type common in Bulimulus^ CylindreUa, etc., arcuate, 

 low ; ends blunt ; thin, transparent ; with eighteen narrow, sepa- 

 rated ribs ; a transverse central line of reinforcement. Attached 

 to the upper margin is a strong triangular membrane of the same 

 consistency and material as the jaw itself, and equally resisting 

 the action of potash, so as readily to be mistaken for the accessory 

 plate of the Succinese. (PI. Y., fig. 11.) 



Lingual membrane (pl. Y. fig. 12, 13) as usual in the Eelicinae. 

 Centrals about as broad as long, tricuspid, the median cusp short 

 and stout, its short point not extending to the base of the plate.

(referred to above under B. Vincentinus). The central tooth is 

 higher than wide, tricuspid, the central cusp short, not extending 

 near the base of the tooth. The laterals (5 in number) are bi- 

 cuspid, tlie inner cusp with short, subcircular cutting edge.

 of the cusps ; central with a large median and small side cusps ; 

 lateral bicuspid, the inner cusp very large, and bluntly pointed, 

 the outer cusp A^ery small, and acutely pointed. Marginals quad- 

 rate, about as high as wide, with one wide, very short, blunt

Figs. 7-10 of plate Y. represent the jaw and lingual dentition of

Before closing this paper, I propose reviewing xny work on lin- 

 gual dentition and jaws, for the purpose of ascertaining what 

 reliance may be placed on their characters as a basis for subgeneric 

 distinction, in the genera Helix and Bulimus. Of Bulimulus we 

 cannot yet speak with confidence, so poor is our material, 



Sagda. — The genus is included in the Vitrinea of von Martens, 

 but we have shown that it belongs to the Helicea, the marginal 

 teeth being quadrate, not aculeate. 



The jaw has no anterior ribs. In H. Jayana there is an approach 

 to a median projection to the cutting edge, but not in Haldemani- 

 ana or Foi^emaniana. 



Tlie lingual membrane we have examined in conjiectens, Jayana, 



I 



I 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



and Haldemaniana. We figure that of the latter (plate IX., fig. 4), 

 with which the others agree. The centrals have their plates short 

 in comparison to the reflection, and broad. The middle cusp is 

 long, with a long slender point. The side cusps are subobsolete, 

 with short, acute, triangular points. The laterals are of same 

 type as centrals, but bicuspid,theouter cusp more developed than 

 the external cusps of the centrals. The marginals are wide, low, 

 with one long, oblique, blunt, narrow inner cusp, and one or more 

 side, small cusps. The dentition and jaw of this species are fully 

 described in Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 175; *S. connectens in Ibid. 

 175 ; S. Jayana in Ann. N. Y. L3'c., x. 219. 



Leucochroa. — We have shown L. Boissieri, Charp., to belong 

 to Helicea and not to Vitrinea, and expressed our belief that the 

 same will prove true of candidissima. (See Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 

 220.) We now figure the dentition (plate IX., fig. 3). The jaw is 

 ribless, with a median projection. 



3Iicrophysa is put in Helicea by von Martens. IT. minuscula 

 (see L. and Fr. w. Shells) and circumjir'mafa, Redf. (N. Y. Ann., 

 X. 231), both belong to Vitrinea^ having aculeate marginal teeth, 

 and jaw of Zonites. H. turbiniformis, Pfr. (Ann. X. Y. L\'c., x. 

 79, pi. ii. fig. 2) has a jaw as in Gylindrella^ BuUmulus^ etc. — i. e. 

 with numerous very delicate, distant ribs, giving the appearance 

 of separate plates. It would be put in Goniognatha of Morch, 

 though there are no upper triangular median plates. We here 

 figure the lingual dentition (plate IX., fig. 7). 



For Patula, Gonostoma, Polygyra, Polygyrella, Stenotrema, 

 Triodopsis^ Mesodon^ Acanthinula^ Vallonia^ Aglaja, Arionta^ 

 Euparypha, Tachea, Pomatia, Glyptosioma, see L. and Fr. w. 

 Shells N. A., I., and our various papers on dentition. 



Dorcasia is known to us only by one species, JI. similaris, Fer. 

 (see Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 176). The jaw has eight decided 

 ribs. I figure the lingual dentition (plate IX., fig. 6). 



Fruticicola is known to us only by H. griseola, Pfr. (see Proc. 

 Phila. Ac. N. S. 1873, 243). The dentition I now figure (plate X., 

 fig. 11). 



Goryda — We have described the lingual membrane only of this 

 subgenus, and that in onl}-- one species, H. Gossei, Pfr. (Am. 

 Journ. Conch., VII. 177). We figure it on plate IX., fig. 2. The 

 centrals have long, narrow plates, a very short reflection, with a 

 short, blunt median cusp and obsolete side cusps. Laterals like 




56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



centrals, but unsymmetrical. Marginals quadrate, with one broad, 

 oblique, long, bluntly bifid inner cusp, and one or two very short 

 rounded side cusps. 



Thelidomns. — We have examined H. aspera, Fer. (Am. Journ. 

 Conch., VI. 204) ; discolor, Fer. (ante, p. 51) ; notahilis, Shuttl. 

 (Amer. Journ. Conch., VII. 177); Zma, Fer. (ante, p. 51); and 

 provisoria, Pfr. (Ann. Lye. N. Y., x. 347). 



There are 8 decided stout ribs on the jaw of aspera, 7 on that 

 of discolor and lima, on provisoria yvQ find 10-15 ribs, less decided 

 than in the other two species. 



I figure the lingual dentition of H. discolor (plate X., fig. 1). 

 H. aspera agrees with it. The marginal teeth of provisoria and 

 notahilis agree with those of aspera and discolor, but as the centrals 

 and laterals diflfer in the shape of the plates and the development 

 of the cusps, I also figure the central and lateral of notahilis 

 (plate IX., fig. 10), with which provisoria agrees. 



Gysticopsis we know by tumida, Pfr., and pemj)liigodes, Pfr. 

 For description and figure of the former see Ann. N. Y. Lye. 

 X. H., IX. 213, f. 3 ; Am. Journ. Conch., VI. 203, f. 1. Finding the 

 dentition of pempJiigodes to be diflbrent (Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 

 177) I here figure it (plate IX., fig. 1). 



Plagioptycha. — We have published ^. Zoa;o(?on, Pfr., Albersiana, 

 Pfr., monodonta. Lea, diaphana, Lea, and macroglossa. (See Am. 

 Journ. Conch., VII. 177, 178.) The}- all agree in having a ribless 

 jaw with blunt median projection to cutting edge, and in dentition 

 such as I figure for H. macroglossa, Pfr. (plate X., fig. 10). 



Pobjmifa We have elsew^here (Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 341) pointed 



out the necessity of revising this subgenus. The t^qjical species 

 muscarum, and H. picta which must be removed to it from Lio- 

 chila, have a ribless jaw without median projection to the cutting 

 margin (see Am. Journ. Conch., VL 204, pi. IX., f. 4, 10). The 

 lingual dentition of both species agrees (see ibid, and Ann. N. Y. 

 Lye, X. pi. xvi. fig. 14). It is entirely different from that of any 

 species now known. 



Hemitrochus must be used as the name for the balance of the 

 subgenus Polymita of von Martens. We have examined varians, 

 Mke. (Amer. Journ. Coneh., VII. 206, and L. and Fr. w. Shells, I. 

 185) ; Troscheli, Pfr. (Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 343); graminicola, Ad. 

 (Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 178) ; gallopavonis, Val. 343. (N. Y. Am. 

 X. 343.) All agree in having an arched ribless jaw with blunt 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



median projection. All have lingual dentition such as I figure 

 of graminicola (plate X., fig. 8). 



Liochila. — As stated already (p. 56) H. picta^ Born, must be 

 removed from this subgenus to Po/(/?Hi^a, probably also H. sulphu- 

 rosa., Mor. 



Eurycratera has decided stout ri'bs on its jaw. We have seen 

 H. crispafa, Fer. (Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 179), and H. angulaia, 

 F^r. (this paper, p. 50). The lingual dentition is essentially the 

 same in each, but on account of difference in the development of 

 the points of the side cusp, I figure that of each (pi. IX. fig. 5; 

 pi. X. fig. 9). 



Polydontes has the same ty])^ of dentition, as in the last sub- 

 genus, as shown in m}^ figure of H. Luquillensis, Shuttl. (plate X., 

 fig. 2-4) the only species examined by us. Jaw not seen. 



Stylodon. — We have shown H. militarise Pfr. to be a Nanina 

 (Ann. X. Y. Lye, x. 169). Other species unexamined, by us. 



Erepta. — The same may be said of H. stylodon, Pfr. (see ante, p. 

 48), and leucosfyla, Pfr., and I'ujizonata, II. Ad. (Ann. N. Y. Lye, 

 X. 169), all Mauritius species. 



Dentellaria. — We have examined a large proportion of the 

 known species. The jaw varies somewhat, so that each descrip- 

 tion should be studied. There seems a tendency to a median pro- 

 jection to the cutting edge, and to the presence of ribs. H.pachy- 

 gantra. Gray (Ann. N. Y. Lj'c, x. 305) has 7 decided ribs and no 

 median projection. H. orhiculata^ Fer. (Am. Journ. Conch., VI. 

 205, pi. ix. f. 14) has traces of ribs and no median projection. H. 

 Isabella, Fer. (I.e. VII. 179) has decided riljs and no median pro- 

 jection. H.dentiens, Fer. (Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 179) has de- 

 cided rilis and no median projection. H. nucleola, Rang (ante, 

 p. 52) has one decided rib and a median projection. H. badia 

 (ante, p. 52) has 8 decided ribs. H. formosa, Fer. (ante, p. 52) 

 has no ribs, but a strong median projection. H. perplexa, Fer. 

 (Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 221) has obsolete ribsand median projection. 

 H. lychnuchus, same as last (Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 221, pi. xiv. f. 5, 

 7). H. punctata, Born (ante, p. 52) has median projection and 

 decided ribs. H. Josephinse, Fer. (Ann. N. Y. Lye, x. 306) is 

 strongh^ arched, has no ribs, but a median projection. 



All tlie above species agree in their dentition. See figure of 

 that of lychnuchus (1. c.) and of pmnctata (plate IX., fig. 8 of this 

 paper.)

Pleurodonta.—The jaw in Chemnitziana^ Pfr. (ante, p. 51) has 

 ^7 stout, separated ribs ; Cormelita, Fer. has 6 (ante, p. 51); acuta, 

 Lam. (Amer. Journ. Concli., VI. 204) has 1 ribs. 



The lingual membrane is the same as I figure for Carmelila 

 (plate X., fig. 5) in Schrote7'iana (Amer. Journ. Conch., VII. 179), 

 in invalida, Ad. (Ann. N. Y. Lye., x. 179). In acuta, Lam. the 

 centrals and laterals are of the same type, but the marginals have 

 only one long, wide, blunt denticle, slightly bifid at end. In this 

 respect it is more like Caracolus than the other species of Pleuro- 

 donta examined by us. 



Caracolus. — We have shown H. Bermudensis, Pfr. (Ann. N. Y. 

 Lye, X. 221) to belong to Vitrinmse; H. inversicolor (1. c. x. 169) 

 to Nanina. 



The jaw in H. mai^ginella, Gmcl. (ante, p. 51) appears to be 

 ribbed. 



I figure (plate X., fig. 6-7) the lingual dentition of H. excel- 

 lens, Pfr. (Am. Journ. Conch. VII. 180). H. margineUa, Gmel. 

 agrees with it, excepting that the cusps of the marginals are 

 shorter. 



Leptoloma. — We have described only H. fuscocincta, Ad. (Am. 

 Journ. Conch,, VII. 180). The jaw has a median projection, but 

 no ribs. The lingual I figure on plate IX., flg. 9. 



Aca^HLs. — H. idhoenix, Pfr. has a ribless jaw (Am. Journ. Conch., 

 VII. 180). Its dentition is figured on plate IX., fig. 11. 



In Bulimus we have examined the following genera: — 



Macrodontes Ave know by B. odontontomos (Am. Journ. Conch., 

 VI. 209). The jaw is ribless. The dentition is figured on plate VI., 

 fig. 7. 



Pelecychilus we know from B.aurissileni, Born (Ann. Lye. N. 

 H. N. Y., X. 229), and B. glaber, Gmel. (not before published) ; both 

 have delicate ribs as in Bulimulus, CylindreUa, etc. The denti- 

 tion of the former is given on plate VI,, fig, 4 ; of the latter on 

 plate VL, fig, 6. 



Anthinus we know from B. nudticolor, Rang (Am. Joui-n. 

 Conch., VI. 208). The jaw is ribless. Lingual dentition given on 

 plate VI., fig. 8. 



Pachyotus we know from B. egregius, Jay (see this paper, p. 54). 

 Jaw not examined. Lingual dentition figured on plate VI. , fig. 1. 



Borua. — We have examined B, oblongus, Mull. Its ribbed jaw 

 and lingual dentition are figured by Heynemann (Mai. Blatt,, xv,). 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



Of Orphnua we have examined one species, B. Hanleyi^ Pfr. 

 (Am. Journ. Conch., VI. 208). The jaw is ribless, with a median 

 projection. The lingual dentition is given on plate VI., fig. 5. 



Dryptus we have examined in two species, B. pardalia, Fer. 

 (Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 181) and B. marmoratus, Dunk. (1. c). 

 The jaw of the latter is unknown. In the former it is ribbed. 

 The lingual dentition oi B. marmoralus is given on plate VI., fig. 2. 

 In. 5. pardalis it has not been examined. 



Eurytus we know from only one species, B. aulacosfylus, Pfr. 

 (Ann. Lye. N. H. N. Y., x. 282). The jaw has delicate ribs as in 

 Bidimulus, Gylindrella, etc. The lingual dentition is given on 

 plate VI., fig. 3. 



A comparison of the figures I have given of the lingual denti- 

 tion of the subgenera of Bidimus shows a greater constancy in 

 that genus than in Helix, especially as regards the marginal 

 teeth. 



I add a figure of the dentition of Gochlosfyla fulgetrum, Brod. 

 (plate v., figs. 14-16). See Am. Journ. Conch., VII. 180.

DESCRIPTION OF SOME SPECIES OF REPTILES OBTAINED BY DR. JOHN 

 F. BRANSFORD, ASSISTANT SURGEON UNITED STATES NAVY, WHILE 

 ATTACHED TO THE NICARAGUAN SURVEYING EXPEDITION IN 1873. 



BY EDWARD D. COPE, A.M. 



The collection, though not large, embraces a number of inter- 

 esting new and rare species besides those usually obtained in the 

 region of Nicaragua. The whole number is twenty-eight, distri- 

 buted as follows: serpents 12, lizards 9, tortoise 1, and Batrachia 

 6. Several interesting points in geographical distribution are 

 established. I have added descriptions of three new snakes, one 

 from near the same, and two from more southern localities. 



OPHIDIA. 



Pliocercus dimidiatus, Cope. 

 Ophibolus micropliolis, Cope. 

 Spilotes pullatus, L. var. 



Of the typical form ; scales in fifteen or sixteen rows, the outer 

 smaller, several median considerably enlarged, the more central 

 only faintly keeled ; generally biporous. Only seven superior 

 labials, the e.ye over the fourth and chiefly the fifth ; sixth and 

 seventh much enlarged, and nearl}?^ reaching the parietal shield, 

 being only separated by a single narrow temporal each. Orbitals 

 1-2, the anterior nearly reaching the frontal. Loreal small, longer 

 than high ; nasals two, quite elongate. Frontal longer than wide, 

 with broad front and concave sides. Parietals wide, truncate, 

 followed by four scuta, the two outer the larger. Temporals 1-1 

 or 1-1-1. Inferior labials eight or nine, separated from the ante- 

 rior gastrosteges by two rows of elongate scales on each side, in 

 continuation of the geneials. 



The general form is elongate; head a long oval; muzzle not 

 prominent. Gastrosteges 226 ; an entire anal; mosteges 118. 



General color black ; near the middle of the length yellow spots 

 appear at intervals on the belly, and increase in extent and fre- 

 quency until they occupy most of the space anteriorly. On the 

 upper surface a few 3'^ellow spots appear at remote intervals on 

 the anterior half. A yellow band extends across the occiput 

 from angle to angle of the mouth, and one across behind the or-

bits. There are large yellow spots on the frontal and supercilia- 

 ries, and the prefontals and labials are yellow-black bordered. 



Masticophis pulcherrimus, sp. nov. 



Scales in quincunx, in seventeen subequal series, all smooth, 

 many of them with two apical pores. Teeth subequal, without 

 noticeable diastemata. Form very slender ; tail one-third the total 

 length. Gastrosteges weakly angulated, anal divided. Head flat, 

 rostral low ; loreal twice as long as high ; prefontal not reaching 

 frontal, which is quite narrow ; occipitals wide oval. Temporals 

 2-2-1-2 and 2-1-1-2. Superior labials nine, fourth, fifth, and 

 sixth bounding orbit. Geneials slender. Total length m. .875 ; 

 tail .285 ; gastrosteges .205 ; urosteges .152. 



Ground color clay-white ; a black band occupying two and two 

 half rows of scales extends on each side from the orbit to the 

 end of the tail. The dorsal interval is one and two half scales in 

 width, and was j-ellowish or reddish in life, except anteriorly, 

 where it is an emerald-green. This brilliant color extends over 

 the entire top of the head. Lips white. 



This species is as slender as, and is partially colored as, some of 

 the tree-snakes of the genus Ahsetulla. From a small collection 

 made on the " western side of Central America" by Prof George 

 Davidson, which also contains Elajys migrocinctus, Gir., Trimor- 

 phoclon major, Cope, Boa eques Eyd-Soul.

 stout, and, unlike most of the genus, nearlj'^ cylindric ; tlie neck 

 is not contracted, but the head is wide and flat, and the muzzle 

 short. Scales rat4Jer wide; in fifteen rows. Rostral plate subtri-

and sixth elongate. Inferior labials ten, mostly transverse ; four 



pairs of geneials, all except the first broader than long. Tail short, M 



m. .04Y in length, from a total of m. .243. ■ 



Color pale, with black transverse spots, which are wide ante- 

 riorly (the second covers seven transverse rows of scales) and 

 become gradually narrower, having a width of only two cross-rows 

 on the hinder part of the body. Posteriorly their lateral ends 

 are broken off, and alternate with tlie dorsal portion. A few small | 



blotches on the ends of the gastrosteges. ? 



This serpent and two fishes were presented to the Academy of ■< 



Natural Sciences with the statement that they were derived from 

 some portion of the Peruvian Andes, from an elevation of twelve 

 thousand feet. One of the fishes is Trichomycterus dispar, C. V., 

 and the other is described below as Protistius semotilus} 



' Protistius semotilus, gen. et sp. nov. 

 Family ? Mugilidse. 



First dorsal fin represented by a single rudimental spine; second ori- 

 ginating a little behind the line of the first anal radii. Ventrals present ; 

 lateral line rudimental. Mouth bordered above by the premaxillary only, > 



which supports a band of rather large bristle-like teeth, those of the outer 

 series the largest. Dentary bones with strong symphysis, with a band of 

 teeth like those of the premaxillary. Swim-bladder present ; alimentary 

 canal short, simple. 



Char. Specif. — Snout conical both from the lateral and vertical views. 

 Premaxillary bone viewed from above, wide and angular crescentic ; top 

 of head moderately convex in cross section, its integument not separated 

 by a fold from the premaxillary. Lower jaw horizontal and angulated at 

 the rictus, and symphysis, as in the genus Mugil. Pectoral fin elevated, 

 rather short, the ventral commencing below its apex. Fin radii D. I. 1. 10 ; 

 P. 15 ; V. 5 ; A. I. 13 ; C. forked 24-8—94-2. Scales 4—81—17 ; lateral 

 line very imperfect ; isolated tubes visible at various points between scapula 

 and tail. Head a little more than four times in length minus caudal fin ; 

 depth of body 5.5 times in the same ; caudal peduncle deep. Eye with 

 round adipose margins, 4.75 times in length of head, and twice in inter- 

 orbital width. Top of head, opercula, and cheeks entirely scaled, the latter 

 in four rows. 



Above olivaceous, below yellow, a broad lead-colored lateral band on the 

 posterior .66 of the length. ^ 



Length to opercular border m. .027, to ventral fins .052, to first dorsal 

 .066, to second dorsal .078 to end of caudal fin .140, all axially measured. 



There are three gills and a half, and no pseudobranchus ; the first bran- 

 chial arch is the only one furnished with rakers. Branchiostegal radii six. 



In its physiognomy this fish is intermediate between that of the MugilidcB

Yellow variety with short superciliary horns. 



LACERTILIA. 



Anolis bransfordii, sp. nov. 



Abdominal scales smooth, pavement-like, longer than the dorsal 

 and lateral scales, which are small, subeqnal, and smooth. Scales 

 of tail subequal, carinate. Muzzle medium, shorter (from eye) 

 than wide at orbits. Auricular meatus large, fully half of eye. 

 Facial rugje obsolete, bounding a distinct cavity, which is covered 

 by smooth scales of the size of those on the remaining portions of 

 the muzzle, in six longitudinal series. Superciliaries wide, sepa- 

 rated from each other by one, and from tlie large occipital b}'' 

 two rows of scales. Twelve supraorbital scuta keeled ; six loreal 

 rows; fan little developed. Infralabials equal, small. Limlis 

 slender, the anterior extending to the groin, the posterior to the 

 end of the muzzle ; dilatations well developed. Brachial and 

 femoral scales equal ventral. Tail long and slender. 



Color above golden-lead color, beneath silver}^, the line of sepa- 

 ration defined from the orbit to the groin. No cross bands on 

 head or body ; front brown speckled ; feet blackish. 



and that of Gyprinodontidm. The form and scaling of the head and mouth, 

 with the small spinous dorsal, are very similar to those of tlie 3Iu(/ils, while 

 the posterior position of the ventral fins and supporting bones, with the 

 simple stomach and intestine, are characters of the latter family. I was 

 unable to find any ductus pneumaticus, and if it exist it must be very slender. 



The weight of evidence is in favor of referring this genus to the Gyprino- 

 dontidm, and should its only dorsal spine occasionally be wanting, the refer- 

 ence will be less inappropriate than might at first appear. 



The rudimental dorsal consists of a short (.002 m.) spine, but little ele- 

 vated above the dorsal line on account of the small extent of the membrane 

 which binds it. It is well separated from the second dorsal. 



This fish must be regarded as an interesting annectant form between types 

 usually placed in the distinct divisions of Physosiomi and Physoclysii.

This species i-esembles both the A. longicaudus. Hallow., and A. 

 trochilus, Cope.' From the former it differs in the smooth abdo- 

 minal scales, large auricular meatus, etc.; resembling more the 

 latter. In A. trochilus, a fine specimen of which accompanies the 

 collection, the scales of the frontal area are much smaller, form- 

 ing nine rows ; four rows separate the superciliaries from each 

 other and from tlie occipital. The muzzle is longer, and the head 

 is marked with brown chevrons and cross-bands.

Propus vermiformis, gen. et sp. nov. 



Chai'. Gen. — Family Chalcididae. Scales smooth, in annuli ; 

 a lateral longitudinal fold. Limbs one pair, the anterior only, 

 without digits or claws. A few pores at the side of the vent. 

 Head shields above, two internasals, one frontal, a narrow super- 

 ciliary which descends in front of each eye, and a pair of parie- 

 tals. Nostrils on the suture between internasal and first labial; 

 a loreal shield. Tail elongate. 



This genus is near to the 02:)hiognomon^ discovered by Prof. 

 Orton in Equador, and is principally distinguished from it by the 

 absence of the posterior limbs. 



Char. Specific. — Scales in twenty-six longitudinal rows on the 

 posterior, and twenty rows on the anterior part (with closed 

 lateral folds) of the body, and fifty-one transverse annuli between 

 the nape and the vent. Anteriorly they are imbricate on the 

 dorsal surface ; posteriorly they are truncate. The abdominal and 

 thoracic scales are subequal, those of the seventh row from the 

 gular groove excepted, which embrace two between the fore limbs, 

 and are not longer but wider than the others, but not so wide as 

 long. 



There are five upper labial plates, of which the third and 

 fourth are of subequal length, and bound the orbit below ; the 

 second is the least. A large rhombic temporal separates the 

 fourth and fifth from the parietals, behind which are two others. 

 There are four narrow inferior labials and three infralabials, of 

 which the two anterior are in contact on the middle line, with 

 those of the opposite side. They are preceded by a large geneial 

 and small symphyseal. The last infralabials are separated from 

 each other by four narrower scuta and from the temporal on each 

 side by two scales. Two pores on each side of the vent, and three 

 elongated scuta in front of it. Tail subquadrate in section (per- 

 haps contracted).

Gerrhosteus prosopis, gen. et sp. nov. 



Dentition opisthogiyph ; cranial scuta normal except that the 

 prefrontals are united into a continuous shield. A loreal and a 

 preocular ; pupil vertical. Anal scutum undivided; subcaudals 

 two rowed. Scales poreless, smooth, subequal. The neural 

 spines of the vertebrae each supporting a shield-like expansion, 

 giving a T-shaped cross section, which is divided by a median 

 groove. 



This genus is the first of the Ophidia known to possess the 

 osseous expansions common to some genera of Batrachia, etc., of 

 the western tropical part of the Neotropical region, and the mio- 

 cene salamanders of the genus Chelotriton, Pom. The great de- 

 velopment of the neural spine is not unlike that seen in frogs of 

 the genus Dendrobates, which are characteristic of this region. 

 The series of closely consecutive bony parallelograms, forms an 

 elevated rib throughout the length of the animal, which is clearly 

 visible through the skin, which is not involved in it, though thin 

 and closel}^ adherent. The structure would appear to be an addi- 

 tional protection to the spinal cord from blows or falling objects. 



Char. Specif. — General appearance that of a Lycodont, while 

 the dental and scutal characters ally it most to Oyrrhojous. 

 Head an elongate oval, very distinct from the narrow neck ; body 

 moderately' stout ; tail short, terminating in a corneous spine. 

 Rostal plate small, not prominent, internasals small. Frontal 

 broad as long, straight in front with two subequal lateral facets 

 for the preocular and the short superciliary. Parietals elongate. 

 Nasal apparently single, large, descending nearly to the edge of 

 the lips. Dorsal small, not longer than high. Preocular large, 




72 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



postoculars two, small. Eye small. Temporals 1-2 narrow. 

 Superior labials seven ; eye over the third and fourth, fifth and 

 sixth the longest ; geneials rather short, subequal. Scales in seven- 

 teen longitudinal series, rather wide ; the first not materially 

 larger. Gastrosteges 137 ; anal 1 ; nrosteges 32. Total length, 

 m. .305 (12.5 inches) ; of head .011 ; of tail .046. 



Color light brown, with black triangular spots on each side of 

 the middle line, the apices directed downward and extending half 

 way to the gastrosteges. The intervals between the apices are 

 about four scales in length, and are centrally darker than imme- 

 diately round the black spots. The spots are sometimes con- 

 nected by a black vitta on the median line, giving, when they 

 alternate, the appearance of zigzag band. Top of head dark 

 brown ; lower surfaces and lips pale and unspotted. 



The neural osseous plate is deeply longitudinall}' fissured, each 

 half having a tubercularly rugose superior face. The anterior 

 border is notched, while the posterior is a little produced on eacHi 

 side of the groove. Length of plate, m. .0018 ; width of plate, 

 .0013.

The Blue Gravel of California. By E. Goldsmith. — Under 

 the name of " Blue Gravel'' the California gold miners, and espe- 

 cially the placer miners, nnderstand a rock which underlies the 

 goldbearing alluvium of that State and part of Nevada. Speci- 

 mens of tliis rock were shown to me by John C. Trautwine, C. E. 

 It is stated that, whenever the goldbearing sand in manj- localities 

 in the two above-named States has been removed b}^ the well- 

 known washing process, the " blue gravel'' appears. It also con- 

 tains gold, which cannot, however, be extracted by washing, the 

 stream of water being unable to disintegrate the rock, which is a 

 compact composite one, and not, as the name "gravel" would 

 imply, a loose material. 



This so-called " blue gravel" is composed of two ingredients 

 widely differing in age, namely, of pebbles cemented together by 

 a lava. The jDebbles are of all sizes. In the specimens alluded 

 to, the^^ are very smootli and rounded, and present no sharp edges 

 or grooves. Their color is externally bi'ownish, with a slight 

 yellow or olive green, but without tlie least trace of blue. When 

 a pebble is scraped or cut with a knife, the fresh exposed surface 

 is bluish-gra3\ The hardness is 4. From the general appearance 

 I infer that some of these pebbles were derived from the sedi- 

 mentary rock, slate, and others from Hornblende rock. 



Entirel}' different in general aspect from the rounded pebbles is 

 the other part of the rock, which I have already stated to be a 

 lava. This appears to envelop the pebbles completel3\ When 

 we detach a pebble from the enveloping mass, a perfect impression 

 of the same is observed, having a beautiful lustre as if it had 

 been freshly oiled. This oil}' lustre, indeed, characterizes the en- 

 tire enveloping mass. Some of tlie dull pebbles are as it were 

 externally polished b^' a coating of the volcanic glass which has 

 run over them. The lustre of the freshlj^ exposed surfaces is 

 brilliant, but it sometimes loses its brilliancy and becomes dull 

 with handling. The color is dirt}' olive-green. This lava is very 

 brittle, so much so that the preparation of a thin plate for micro- 

 scopical observation is impossible. The hardness is equal to 

 ajjatite. 



The most distinguishing crystallization within the lava mass 

 is a black mica, which is probably biotite. I noticed also a few 

 grains of quartz, as well as flattened grains of bright j'ellow gold. 

 These are all observable by the naked eye, and, with the pocket 




74 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



lens, I could detect nothing more. When small fragments of 

 irregular form were placed under a more powerful magnifier, the 

 black mica appeared smoky by a transmitted light, or green when 

 in very thin platfis, and most of the material seemed to be a green 

 amorphous glass, having no effect on polarized light. The specific 

 gravity I found to be 2.48. The silica I determined by an analy- 

 sis to be 65.48 per cent. We might presume that the amount of 

 silica should be greater than that obtained, but we must keep in 

 mind that the biotite present contains only about 40 per cent, of 

 it, and thus reduces the proportion ; however, the quantity indi- 

 cates that we must class this lava among the acidic ones. The 

 conclusion at which I arrive is that the so-called " blue gravel" 

 of California is a conglomerate of pebbles of various kinds ce- 

 mented together by an acidic lava in which crj'stals of mica (bio- 

 tite) and grains of gold are imbedded. 



How the gold came into the lava is a question of some diflficulty. 

 Whether it was mingled with the pebbles before the lava ran over 

 the bed, or whether the gold was ejected from the volcano, I am 

 not able to decide. It would require observations on a variety of 

 specimens to arrive at some plausible theory. The specimens I 

 have seen had the gold suspended in the lava. The metal did not 

 touch the pebbles ; therefore, if the gold was present in the pebble 

 bed prior to the ejection of the lava, this latter must have raised 

 the metal from its bed, that is to say, a metal of s. g. 19.3 must 

 have been raised by a semifluid mass having s. g. = 2.48 ! 



Of course my observations are limited on these questions, but 

 since copper was ejected by the ancient volcano on Lake Superior, 

 may not gold have been similarly ejected in the case before us ?

Prof. Leidy called attention to the " Bulletin of the United 

 States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories, 

 No. 2," presented this evening. It contains a "Review of the 

 Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Period found west of the Mississippi 

 River," by Prof. Cope. In this article he was quoted in such a 

 way as not fairly to express his original meaning. Thus, on page 

 T of the Bulletin, reference is made to the Proceedings of this 

 Academy, 1856, p. 312, in which it is intimated that Thespesius 

 occidentalis was referred to the Mammalia, and regarded, per- 

 haps, as a Dinosaurian. In the Proceedings I have rather ex- 

 pressed the reverse, as I state of T. occidentalis, " among the 

 collection of vertebrate remains, are two apparent caudal vertebra; 

 and a first phalanx of some huge animal, which I suspect to be a 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



Dinosaurian, though they may have belonged to a mammalian." 

 I may add that, on p. 8, Prof. Cope, quoting from the same Pro- 

 ceedings, p. 89, indicated that I had referred Isch^a'otherium to a 

 Sirenian. This is so, but Prof. Cope appears to liave overlooked 

 the more full account of the animal in the Trans, of the Am. Phil. 

 Soc, 1859, p. 151, in which, though I still refer it with doubt to 

 the mammalia sirenia, I state that the remains may have belonged 

 to an aquatic reptile. 



In view of the reptilian character of Ischyrotherium, Prof. C. 

 has changed the name to Ischyrosaurus, but his reason for doing 

 so appearc to me not to be valid, as classical authorities at times 

 have included reptiles in the word therion^ and it has been con- 

 sidered admissible as applied to the extinct Cheirotherium.

Note on the Enemies of Difflugia. — Prof. Leidy remarked that 

 in the relationship of Difflagia and Amreha we would suppose 

 that the former had been evolved from the latter, and that its stone 

 house would protect it from enemies to which the Amoeba would 

 be most exposed. The Difflugia had many enemies. I have 

 repeatedly observed an Amceba with a swallowed Arcella, but 

 never with a Difflugia. Worms destroy many of the latter, and 

 I have frequently observed them within the intestine of Nais^ 

 Prisfina, Chaetogaster, and ^oloaoma. I was surprised to find 

 that Slentor polymorphus was also fond of Difflugia, and I have 

 frequently observed this animalcule containing them. On one 

 occasion I accidentally fixed a Sfeutor by pressing down the cover 

 of an animalcule cage on a Difflugia, which it had swallowed. 

 The Stentor contracted, and suddenlj' elongated, and repeated 

 tiiese movements until it had split three-fourths the length of its 

 bod}^ through, and had torn itself loose from the fastened Difflu- 

 gia. Nor did the Stentor suffer from this la(!eration of its body, 

 for in the course of several hours each half became separated as a 

 distinct individual. 



Remarks on a supposed Compound derived from Leather. — 

 Prof. Leidy directed attention to a dark-red, compact, shining, 

 resinous-looking mass, several inches in tliickness, which, he said, 

 was reputed to have been derived from leatlier in the great fire of 

 Chicago. It now exhibits no evidence of organized structure, 

 and its origin would not have been suspected from its appear- 

 ance. On burning it still gives out the peculiar odor of burning 

 leather. It was supposed to be a compound evolved from the 

 leather, under the influence of high heat with absence of air.

On Echinorhynchus moniliformis. — Dr. H. C. Chapman made 

 the following remarks : I take the opportunity of exhibiting spe- 

 cimens of the rare and interesting worm the Echinorhynchus moni- 

 liformis from the alimentary canal of the Fox Squirrel (Sciurus 

 vulpinus) known to occur also in the Hamster and Field Mouse. 

 This species is so called from its resembling a row of pearls ; its 

 posterior portion is, however, smooth. The color of the worm is 

 white. The characteristic snout is armed with about a dozen 

 rows of recurved hooks, which enables the worm to hold on to the 

 animal which it infests. This proboscis is retractile, being moved 

 by delicate muscles. The male is much smaller than the female, 

 and can be readily distinguished by the sac at its posterior extre- 

 mity, which serves as a receptacle for the penis. In this species 

 the testicles occupy only a small portion of the posterior part of 

 the animal, while the ovaries, filled with eggs, extend through the 

 entire length of the body. The female in this species attains a 

 length of eleven inches, the male only that of from four to five. 

 The Echinorhynchus is a member of the Acanthocephali or " Spiney 

 Heads," a family of round worms.

Analysis of Graphite from Wythe County^ Virginia. By E. 

 Goldsmith. — Of all the varieties, of Graphite that have come 

 under my notice, I have never seen any resembling that which was 

 given to me recently bj' Mr. John C. Trautwine, C. E. It is com- 

 pact massive ; the touch is smooth. If cut with a knife or scratched 

 with the finger nail, it shows a bright dark metallic lustre. The 

 fracture is rough, uneven, dull. The color is dark blue, so that 

 the mineral greatly resembles the massive earthy vivianite of New 

 Jersey. The powder has the same color. 



Talc makes an impression on it, hence its softness is less than 

 one. Lines drawn with it on paper are of a dark gray hue, similar 

 to common soft lead pencil marks. Specific gravity = 2.1068. 

 The blowpipe reactions, as well as my qualitative analj'sis, showed 

 that beside the carbon a large proportion of silica, alumina, and 

 iron oxides, also a trace of manganese, were present. The mineral 

 contains a considerable amount of gas, the quantity and reactions 

 of which I had not the means to ascertain. 



The quantitative determinations of the amount of moisture and 

 gases, the carbon, and ashes were found in the same manner as is 

 usually adopted in the analysis of anthracite. 



These were the results : — 



Carbon 29.12. 



Ashes 60.61. 



Gases and moisture . . . 10.27.

 phite.

Notice of some Nexo Fresh-water Rhizopods. — Prof. Leidy re- 

 marked that besides the ordinary species of Amoeba, which he had 

 observed in the vicinity of Philadelphia, he had discovered what 

 he suspected to be a new generic form. It has all the essential 

 characters of Amceba, but in addition is provided with tufts of 

 tail-like appendages or rays, from which he proposed to name the 



genus OURAMCEBA. 



The rays project from what may be regarded as the back part 

 of the body as the animal always moves or progresses in advance 

 of the position of those appendages. The rays are quite different 

 from pseudopods, or the delicate rays of the Actinophryens. 




78 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



They are not used in securing food, nor is their function obvious. 

 The Ouramoeha moves like an ordinary Amoeba, and obtains its 

 food in tlie same manner. The tail-like rays are not I'etractile, 

 and they are rigid and coarse compared with those of Actino- 

 phrj^ens. They are simple or unbranclied, except at their origin, 

 and they are cylindrical, of uniform breadth, and less uniform 

 length. When torn from the body they are observed to originate 

 from a common stock attached to a rounded eminence. 



Several forms of the Ouramceba were observed, but it is uncer- 

 tain whether they pertain to one or several species. One of the 

 forms had an oblong ovoid bod}^ about the ^th of a line long and 

 y^^th of a line broad. The tail-like rays formed half a dozen tufts, 

 measuring in length about the width of the body. The latter 

 was so gorged with large diatomes, such as Navicula viridis, 

 together with desmids and confervae, that the existence of a 

 nucleus could not be ascertained. The species may be distin- 

 guished with the name of Ouramceba vorax. 



A second form, perhaps of a different species, moved actively 

 and extended its broad pseudopods like Amoeba princeps. When 

 first viewed beneath the microscope it appeared irregularly globu- 

 lar and about the y'^th of a line in diameter. It elongated to the 

 ^th of a line, and moved with its tail-like appendages in the rear. 

 These appendages formed five tufts about the ^j'^th of a line long. 

 The interior of the body exhibited a large contractile vesicle and 

 a discoid nucleus. This second form may be distinguished with 

 the name of Ouram(eba lapsa. 



Another Ouramoeba had two comparatively short tufts of rays, 

 and a fourth, of smaller size than the others, had a single tuft of 

 three moniliform rays. 



It is possible that Ouramoeba is the same as the Plagiophrys 

 of Claparede, though the description of this does not apply to 

 that. 



Plagiopihrys is said to be an Actinophryen, furnished with a 

 bundle of rays emanating from a single point of the body, but 

 the rays are described as of the same kind and use as those of 

 Actinojyhrys. Plagiophrys is further stated to be provided with 

 a distinct tegument like Corycia of Dujardin, or Pamphagus of 

 Bailey, but the body of Ouramceba is as free from any investment 

 as an ordinary Amoeba, and the rays are fixed tail-like appen- 

 dages with no power of elongation or contraction. 



The species of Ouramoeba were found among desmids and dia- 

 tomes, on the surface of the mud at the bottom of a pond, near 

 Darby Creek, on the Philadelphia and West Chester Railroad. 



Two of the commonest species of Difflugia of our neighborhood 

 I had until recently confounded together as D. proteiformis, and, 

 perhaps, the two forms may be included under the latter name in 

 Europe. In one the mouth is deeply trilobed, and the animal is 

 usually green with chlorophjd globules. In the other the mouth 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 79 



is crenulate, usually with six shallow crenulations, and the animal 

 is devoid of chlorophyl. The former is usually the smaller, and 

 may be distinguished with the name of D. lobostoma; the latter 

 may be named D. crenulata. 



In an old brick pond, on the grounds of Swarthraore College, 

 Delaware County, among Difflugia prjriformis, D. spiralis^ D. 

 corona, D. acuminata, and others not yet determined, there occui's 

 an abundance of a large species, apparently undescribed. It is 

 sometimes the fourth of a line in length, and is compressed pyri- 

 form, but is quite variable in its relation of length to breadth, and 

 in the shape of the fundus of the shell. This is often trilobate, 

 but from the non-production of one or more or all the lobes, differs 

 in appearance in different individuals. The animal is filled with 

 chlorophyl grains, from which it might be named D. entochloris. 



Another large JDifflugia, allied to D. lageniformis, is not unfre- 

 quent about Philadelphia. The shell is beautifully vase-like in 

 shape. It has an oval or sub-spherical body with a constricted 

 neck, and a recurved lip to the mouth. The body of the shell 

 opposite the mouth is acute and often acuminate. The animal 

 contains no chloroph3'l. One shell measured ;§• of a line long by 

 ^ of a line broad; another measured :^ of a line long by | of a 

 line broad. The species may be named D. amphora. 



A Difilugian, found in a spring on Darby Creek, is interesting, 

 from its transparency, which allows the structure of the animal to 

 be seen in all its details. The investment is membranous and 

 apparently structureless. The soft granular contents occupy 

 about one-half of the investment, and are connected with this by 

 long threads. The pseudopods are protruded in finger-like pro- 

 cesses. The form of the animal is compressed ovoid, with the 

 narrow pole truncate and forming the transversely oval mouth. 

 It is probably the species Difflugia ligaf a, described by Mr. Tatem, 

 of England. Its length is about ^'gd of a line. The character of 

 the investment is so different from that of oi'dinary Difilugian s 

 tliat the species may be regarded as pertaining to another genus, 

 for which the name of Catharia would be appropriate. 



Dr. Chapman made the following remarks on the generative 

 apparatus of the Tehennopliorus Garolinensis : — 



Various have been the interpretations offered from time to time 

 of the generative organs of the Gasteropoda. Thus Cuvier con- 

 sidered what is now regarded as an hermaphi'oditic organ to be 

 the ovary. Later observers regarded this hermaphroditic organ as 

 the testicle, and considered what is now supposed to be an albu- 

 minous gland the ovary, and which Cuvier regai'ded as part of 

 the testicle. With reference to these views, I have recently 

 dissected the Tebennophorus Carolinensis, a slug found often in 

 our environs under trees, etc., and found both ova and sperma- 

 tozoa in the organ regarded first as simply the ovary, later as the 




80 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



testicle. I take the opportunity of acknowledging the assistance 

 afforded me in ray dissection by Dr. Leidy's beautiful monograph 

 on the Gasteropoda.

The Veins of Beech and Hornbean Leaves. — Mr. Thomas Mee- 

 HAN said that De Candolle had noticed some years since a differ- 

 ence in the venation between the Fagiis ferruginea and Fagus 

 sylvatica, the common American and European beeches. In the 

 American beech the lateral veins were said to terminate in the 

 apex of the serratures — in the European they terminate at the base 

 of the sinus. He had not read the original paper of De Candolle, 

 but abstracts in the scientific serials. As the statement stood, it 

 conveyed the idea that there was a marked difference in structure 

 between these two allied species which did not, however, exist, as 

 growing in this countr}' the leaves of the European beech are al- 

 most entire; the lateral veins, in approaching the margin of the 

 leaves, curve upwards, and connect with the lateral above them, 

 forming a sort of marginal vein near the outer edge of the leaf. 

 The veins of the American beech curve upward in the same wa}^, 

 but are early arrested, and this sudden cessation of growth pro- 

 duces the serra, which are slightly curved upwards. An early ar- 

 restation of growth in the veins makes the serratures, and consti- 

 tutes the onl}' difference between the two species. The structural 

 plan is the same in both — the European, curving its lateral vein 

 into the apex, reached the upper one — the American terminating 

 abruptly. 



There was a greater tendenc_y to marginal development in some 

 European than in allied American species. In the Carpinus Be- 

 tulus, the English Hornbean, there were from four to five teeth 

 between each pair of lateral nerves, while there were but from two 

 to three between those of the American — Carpinus Americana — 

 a character that was quite as distinctive between these two very 

 closely allied species, as the viens were in the case of the beech. 



Direct Growth Force. — Mr. Meehan referred to some potatoes 

 exhibited by him to the Academy a few years ago, in which the 

 stolons of a gi'ass had penetrated througli from one side to the 

 other, preferring, as it would seem, to go through such an ob- 

 struction to turning aside to avoid it. A potato was a rather 

 rough surfaced body. He now exhibited a similar case, only the 

 obstruction was the round smooth root of an herbaceous peony. 

 Though not more than one-third of an inch thick and round, a

stolon of Trilicum repens^ the common couch grass, had pushed 

 itself through.

DESCRIPTION OF TWO NEW FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE UPPER AMAZON. 

 BY T. A. CONRAD. 



The Pebas group of the Upper Amazon was first discovered by 

 Prof. James Orton in 1867, who obtained a collection of the re- 

 markable shells, some of which were first described by Mr. Gabb. 

 Siibsequentl}^, at request of Prof. Orton, Mr. Hauxwell collected 

 other specimens, and Prof. Steere obtained some new species, 

 besides a very large number of several species of Pachydon. 

 Prof. Orton, having revisited the region in which the Pebas group 

 occurs, has found two new forms which he has forwarded to me to 

 describe. These new shells belong to fresh-water genera, and help 

 to define the nature of the habitat of the group. They confirm 

 the opinion I advanced in the preceding paper, that it was a basin 

 of fresh water to which brackish water had access at times. The 

 Hemisinus herein described occurs crowded in the clay in such 

 perfection that the species must have lived and died on the spot, 

 and as the living shells of the genus inhabit fresh-water rivers of 

 South America, very far from salt water, they are as much fresh- 

 water shells as are those of Melania. Some of the shells are 

 water-worn, and there is abundance of small fragments of shells 

 in the clay, in which respect it resembles some of the Miocene beds 

 of Virginia. The Pebas clay in all the localities is crowded with 

 specimens of Isaea Orloni, I. lintea, Liris laqueata, all of which 

 I believe to be fresh-water shells of the family Melaniidse. 



The two shells described in this paper were found at Iquitos, 

 about 100 miles west of Pebas.

Prof. Orton remarks that he saw many fragments of this shell, 

 and, therefore, it probal)ly lived in company with Pacliydon, but 

 the lamina of the shell separate so readily that fragments only are 

 obtainable. The shape of the shell is evidently somewhat like 



that of a TRIQUETRA.

The thanks of the Academy were tendered to Mr. Alfred B. 

 Durand for a life-sized portrait of his father, the late Elias Durand, 

 presented this evening. 



Habits of the Orchard Oriole. — Mr. Thomas Meehan stated 

 that he was not familiar with the latest knowledge in ornitholog}', 

 that not being a special study with him; but if Wilson's Orni- 

 thology contained all that was known of the habits of the orchard 

 oriole — Oriolus mutatus — he might say that the bird did not con- 

 fine itself solely to insect food. He had on his grounds a large 

 specimen of the Staphylea tri/olia, which, when in bloom, was a 

 favorite resort with bumblebees and humming-birds, and the oriole 

 took its share of honey from the flowers as well. It did not rest 

 on the wing as the humming-bird did, but sought a lower branch 

 from which it could leisurely' extract the sweets from the flowers 

 above. He had thought it possible that the bird was in search of 

 insects among the flowers, but a careful examination proved 

 otherwise. 



Poisonous character of the Flowers of Wistaria Sinensis. — 

 Mr. Meehan remarked that there was a popular belief that the 

 flowers of the Wistaria sinensis were destructive to bees. He 

 had himself seen hundreds of dead bees under large flowering 

 plants. He was struck with the fact this season, that none were 

 dead under similar circumstances. The flowers were continually 

 visited b}' the honey bee, and others, without, so far as he could 

 see, any fatal results following. It was clear, therefore, that, what- 

 ever might be the cause of the death of these insects under some 

 circumstances, it could not be from the honey alone. 



Growth of the Cuicus arvensis, Hofl". — In regard to the rapidity 

 with which plants sometimes grew, Mr. Thomas Meehan observed 

 that, though it was well known that the Canada thistle spread sur- 

 prisingly, there had been no figures, giving its exact growth, 

 placed on record. In the first week in May, 18*13, he sowed a 

 few seeds. By the first week in June the little plants were well 

 above the ground, and about to push out their stolons. They 

 continued to radiate from this centre in evei'y direction till the 

 first week in September, when they had reached a distance of six 

 feet, covering a circle of twelve feet in diameter, the space being 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 85 



profusely filled with plants thrown up from the creeping stolons. 

 This gave an average of about three-fourths of an inch of growth 

 per day ; equal to maize or other rapid-growing vegetation above 

 ground.

 Sixteen members present. 



Prof. Persifor Frazer, Jr., made the following remarks : — 



During a recent trip to Missouri I had an opportunity of visit- 

 ing and personally examining the Pilot Knob, and Iron Mountain, 

 and Mine La Motte districts, in company with two of the assist- 

 ant geologists — Prof. Potter and Mr. Gage. There is much in 

 this district, and in fact in most parts of Missouri, to interest 

 the student of geology from east of the Alleghanies: for example, 

 tlie variations in the character of the porph^-r}-, wliich is the 

 archsean according to Prof. Pumpelly, or the azoic member of the 

 Missouri series. This porphyry carries several deposits of ore, 

 both veins and beds, as has been ably pointed out in the recent 

 geological survey of tlie State by Prof. Pumpell3\ This, and the 

 magnesian limestones which overlie it, form the principal part of 

 the surface in the southeastern part of the State. 



Mine La Motte is situated in St. Francois County, about ninety 

 miles nearly due south of St. Louis. There are extensive works 

 put up on this property, and the whole was sold to an English 

 compan}' two years ago for $3,000,000, but the sale could not be 

 ratified owing to a law of Missouri which prohibits foreigners 

 from holding property in that State. At least such was the in- 

 formation given to me. The deposits of lead and copper and 

 nickel ores at Mine La Motte, part of a great belt about one hun- 

 dred miles wide which crosses the State from southeast to north- 

 west, lie in the limestone. At Mine La Motte there is a pro- 

 fuse occurrence of nickel-bearing minerals, and especially of 

 millerite, which is found in stellate, acicnlar, and radial crA'stals 

 on the surface of many of the lumps of ore. 



The works here, before they were burned down, treated the 

 ores in open American hearths, and brought out matt which was 

 shipped to Swansea. It is said, on competent authoritj', that a 

 galena exhibiting a peculiar blue color (like that found on the 

 surface of much peacock ore), contains cobalt. The cause of this 

 color, and also its connection with the contained metal, are not 

 perfectly understood. Almost all of the galena of the district is 

 colored in this wa}'. » 



I present also specimens of iron ore from Iron ]Nrountain, 

 Missouri, Avhere it occurs in irregular veins, intersecting the por-

phyry mountain in all directions. This mountain covers at its 

 base about seventy acres, more or less, and is furrowed by deep cuts 

 near its summit ; some of these to a depth of eiglitj' to one hun- 

 dred feet. The best and purest ore is that which was found lying 

 on the surface of its slopes, and of this there is still a very large 

 quantity; but the large boulders have been almost all removed, 

 while that which remains is so finely divided and so mixed with 

 the clay and soil that any ordinary method of separation would 

 make it too expensive. 



Lately, the California hydraulic mining has been applied to 

 win this ore, with great success. Water is pumped through large 

 hoses which are led up the sides of the hills, and the debris is 

 washed down through sluice-boxes and over small falls, which 

 agitate it sufficiently to shake the ore from the dirt and allow it 

 to deposit at the foot of the hill by virtue of its higher specific 

 gravity', in receptacles provided for it. The remaining ore is ob- 

 tained by blasting, is loaded on a gravit}' railway and carried to 

 the foot of the mountain, where it is dumped, three or four tons 

 at a time, over a shoot which precipitates it some eight or ten 

 feet, upon the flats of the Iron Mountain Railroad Compan}', which 

 are awaiting it. The shock as this heavy weight strikes the cars 

 is great enough to cause them sometimes to tilt over on two 

 wheels. How much it increases the wear and tear I was unable 

 to ascertain. 



This ore contains from 65 to 68 per cent, metallic iron, asso- 

 ciated with 0.031 per cent, to 0.11 per cent, phosphorus and 4 to 

 4.5 per cent, silica, and a trace of sulphur. The quantity exposed 

 is enormous, but was stated by Mr. David Thomas, of Catasauqua, 

 not to equal in quantity the celebrated Cornwall mines of this 

 State. 



The ore from Pilot Knob is much more sandy than that from 

 Iron Mountain. It occurs in a bed dipping with the general dip 

 of the country rock, and inclosed within the porphyry out of 

 which the knob is formed. The formation of this ore is a most in- 

 teresting study, and the only plausible theory seems to be that of 

 lateral replacement, a case of metasomatism where the porphyry, 

 having become slat}' in structure, and less capable of resisting 

 tlie solvent, has been replaced along the line of strike, and only 

 in such laminated parts. This ore is banded in appearance, and 

 is almost, if not quite, invariably hematite.

Notice of some Fresh-water and Terrestrial Pchizopodi^. — Prof. 

 Leidy stated that among the amoeboid forms noticed hy him in 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



the vicinity of our cit}', there was one especially remarkable for 

 the comparatively enormous quantity of quartzose sand which it 

 swallowed with its food. The animal might be A-iewed as a bag 

 of sand ! It is a sluggish creature, and when at rest appears as 

 an opaque white, spherical ball, ranging from |^ to f of a line in 

 diameter. The animal moves slowly, first assuming an oval and 

 then a clavate form. In the oval form one measured f of a Viv.e 

 long by f of a line broad, and when it became clavate it was § of 

 a line long b}' |^ of a line broad at the advanced thick end. An- 

 other, in the clavate form, measured | of a line long bj' ^ of a 

 line wide at the thick end. The creature rolls or extends in ad- 

 vance while it contracts behind. Unless under pressure it i)uts 

 forth no pseudopods, and the granular entosarc usually follows 

 closely on the limits of the extending ectosarc. Generally the 

 animal drags after it a quantity of adherent dirt attached to a 

 papillated or villous discoid projection of the body. 



The contents of the animal besides the granular matter and 

 many globules of the entosarc, consists of diatomes, desmids, 

 and confervas, together with a larger proportion of angular particles 

 of transparent and mostly colorless quartz. Treated with strong 

 mineral acids so as to destroy' all the soft parts, the animal leaves 

 behind more than half its bulk of quartzose sand. 



The species may be named Am(eba sabulosa, and is probably 

 a member of the genus Pelomyxa, of Dr. Greef (Archiv f. Mik. 

 Anai., x, 1873, 51). 



The animal was first found on the muddj' bottom of a pond, on 

 Dr. George Smith's place, in Upper Darby, Delaware Count}', but 

 has been found also in ponds in New Jersey. 



When the animal was first noticed with its multitude of sand 

 particles, it suggested the probability that it might peitain to a 

 stage of life of Dijfiugio., and that by the fixation of the quartz 

 jjarticles in the exterior, the case of the latter would be formed. 

 This is conjectural and not confirmed b}' any observation. 



A minute amoeboid animal found, on Spirogyy^a, in a ditch'^at 

 Cooper's Point, opposite Philadelphia, is of interesting character. 

 The bod}' is hemispherical, yellowish, and consists of a granular 

 entosarc with a number of scattered and well-defined globules, 

 besides a large contractile A'esicle. From the body there extends 

 a broad zone, which is colorless and so exceedingly delicate that 

 it requires a power of 600 diameters to see it favorabl}'. By this 

 zone the animal glides over the surface. As delicate as it is, it 

 evidently possesses a regular structure, though it was not re- 

 solved under the best powers of the microscope. The structui-e 

 probably consists of globular granules of uniform size alternating 

 with one another, so that the disk at times appears crossed by 

 delicate lines, and at others as if finely and regularl}'- punctated. 

 The body of the animal measures from ^^ to j'^ of a line in dia- 

 meter, and the zone is from ^^^ to ^l^y of ^ li"^ wide. The species 

 may be named Amceba zonalis. 




88 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The interesting researclies of Prof. Richard Greef, of Marburg, 

 published iu the second volume of SchulLze's Archiv f. Mikros- 

 kopische Anatomie, on Araoebge living in the earth (Ueber einige 

 in der Erde lebende Amceben, etc.), led me to look iu similar 

 positions for Rhizopods. 



In the earth about the roots of mosses growing iu the crevices 

 of the bricks of our city pavements, in damp places, besides find- 

 ing several species of Amoeba, together with abundance of the 

 common wheel-animalcule, Rotifer vulgaris, I had the good fortune 

 to discover a species of Gromia. I say good fortune, for it is 

 with the utmost pleasure I have watched this curious creature for 

 hours together. The o-enus was discovered and well described 

 by Dujardin, from two species, one of which, G. oviformis, was 

 found in the seas of France; the other, the G. Jluviatilis, in the 

 River Seine. 



Imagine an animal, like one of our autumnal spiders stationed 

 at the centre of its well-spread net ; imagine every thread of this 

 net to be a living extension of the animal, elongating, branching, 

 and becoming confluent so as to form a most intricate net; and 

 imagine every thread to exhibit actively moving currents of a 

 viscid liquid both outward and inward, carrj-ing along particles 

 of food and dirt, and you have some idea of the general character 

 of a Gromia. 



The Gromia of our pavements is a spherical cream-colored 

 body, about the yV^h of a line iu diameter. When detached from 

 its position and placed in water, in a few minutes it projects iu 

 all directions a most wonderful and intricate net. Along the 

 threads of this net float minute naviculae from the neighborhood, 

 like boats in the current of a stream, until reaching the central 

 mass they are there swallowed. Particles of dirt are also col- 

 lected from all directions and are accumulated around the animal, ^ 

 and when the accumulation is sufficient to protect it, the web is ^ 

 withdrawn and nothing apparently will again induce the animal 

 to produce it. 



From these observations we may suppose that the Gromta ' 



TERRicoLA, as I proposc to name the species, during drj^ weather 

 remains quiescent and concealed among accumulated dirt in the 

 crevices of our pavements, but that in rains or wet weather the 

 little creature puts forth its living net which becomes so many 

 avenues along which food is conveyed to the body. As the 

 neighborhood becomes dry, the net is withdrawn to await another 

 rain. The animal with its extended net can cover an area of 

 nearly half a line in diameter. The threads of the net are less 

 than the ^^^oo^^ ^^ ^^ "^^^ ^^ diameter. 



Remarks on the Revivification of Rotifer vulgaris — Prof. 

 Leidy remarked that during the search for Rhizopods, having 

 noticed among the dirt adhering to the mosses in the crevices of 



I 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 89 



our pavements many individuals of the common •wheel-animalcule, 

 Rotifer vulgaris^ he had made some observations relating to the 

 assertion that thej' might be revivified on moistening them after 

 they liad been dried up. 



Two glass slides, containing, beneath cover glasses, some dirt, 

 exhibited each about a dozen active living Rotifers. The glass 

 slides were placed on a window ledge of m}^ studj^, the thermo- 

 meter standing at 80^. In the course of half an hour the water 

 on the slides was dried up and the dirt collected in ridges. The 

 next morning, about twelve hours after drying the slides, they 

 were placed beneath the microscope. Water was applied and the 

 materials on the slides closely examined. On each slide a number 

 of apparently dried Rotifers were observed. These imbibed 

 water and expanded, and some of them in the course of half an 

 hour revived and exhibited their usual movements, but others 

 remained motionless to the last. 



The same slides were again submitted to drying, and from one 

 of them the cover glass was removed. They were examined the 

 next da}', but several hours after moistening them only two 

 Rotifers were noticed moving on each slide. 



I next prepared a slide on which there were upwards of twenty 

 actively- moving Rotifers, and exposed it to the hot sun daring 

 the afternoon. On examination of the slide the following morn- 

 ing, after moistening the material, all the Rotifers continued mo- 

 tionless, and remained so to the last moment. 



From these observations it would appear that the Rotifers and 

 their associates became inactive in comparatively dry positions 

 and may be revived on supplying them with more moisture, but 

 when the animals are actually dried the}^ are incapable of being 

 revivified. Moisture adheres tenaciously to earth, and Rotifers 

 may rest in the earth, like the Lepidosiren., until returning waters 

 restore them to activit}^ 



Prof. Cope mentioned the capture of a young Balsena cisarcfica, 

 of fortj'-eight feet in length, in the Raritan River, near South 

 Ambo}', on May 30th. The skeleton was buried and would be 

 preserved in some museum. He examined the whalebone, of 

 which there are 245 lamina on each side of the mouth. The color 

 is black and the hair is fine, long, and has a brownish tinge ; length 

 of longest plate with hair, 48 inches. The gum is 116 inches long 

 and 11 inches deep. He was informed that the whale was entirely 

 black, and the dorsal line without irregularities. 



Prof. Cope exhibited mounted crania of some gigantic horned 

 mammalia of the Miocene of Colorado, viz., the Symborodon 

 bucco, S. altirost7-is, S. acer, and S. tricjonoceros. He explained 

 the distinctive features of this genus as compared with Tifano- 

 therixim, exhibiting typical specimens of the latter from the Aca- 

 demy's museum, showing four inferior incisor teeth, while the

lower jaw of Symhorodon does not possess an}^ He pointed 

 out that these animals had small brains, with few convolutions, 

 whicli were separated by deep fissures occupied by thin bony 

 laminpe, and that the falx and tentorium are well developed. He 

 pointed out the relatively small size of the brain, and that at 

 least half of the length of the cranium is occupied by enormous, 

 undivided frontal sinuses. Each of these communicates with the 

 nasal meatus by an elongate foramen, and enters the base of the 

 corresponding horn core. He stated that similar sinuses exist iu 

 the cranium of Eobasileus, and enter the basis of the middle pair 

 of horns in the same manner.

On the Pelvis of Hadrosaurus. — Prof. B. Waterhouse Haw- 

 kins, having completed his model of Hadrosaurus at Princeton 

 College, took the occasion to call the attention of the Academy to 

 his success in placing certain fugitive bones belonging to Hadro- 

 saurus, and also to its English cousin Iguanodon. It might be 

 allowal)le to remind the meeting of the fact that in 1868, when he 

 had made and presented the restoration of Hadrosaurus now in 

 the museum, he then recognized the homologous character of 

 a bone described by Dr. Leidy in his monograph of the Cretaceous 

 Reptiles, to that which had become a fugitive bone in Iguanodon, 

 the English representative of Hadrosaurus. These bones had 

 been for many years appointed to the place of clavicles by Prof. 

 Owen and Dr. Mantel, of England. When Mr. Hawkins made his 

 large restoration of Iguanodon at the Crystal Palace, in 1853, 

 his first difficulty was to find room for these so-called clavicles in 

 his model, a task which he was obliged to abandon, as they were 

 twice the size which the natural arrangement of the limbs rendered 

 possible. A few days previous to his sailing for America he found 

 that Prof Huxley had been studying the same problem of their 

 true position in the animal's bod}'^, concerning which he delivered 

 an address before the Royal Institution. Prof Huxley, on this 

 occasion, transposed the pseudo-clavicles from the pectoral to 

 the pelvic arch, where he arranged them either as pubic or ischiatic 

 bones, and placed them as in the ostrich and rhea. At the same 

 time tliis transposition was taken advantage of to suggest the 

 probability of Iguanodon walking on its hind legs, thus account- 

 ing for some of the larger forms of bipedal footprints, and justify- 

 ing the establishment of the new order Ornithosauria. On the 

 arrival of Prof. Hawkins in America, after studying Dr. Leidy's 

 description of Hadrosaurus, he found that Dr. L. had anticipated 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



Prof Huxley's transposition of the pseudo-clavicles, which he 

 suggested in the above-named description might more probably 

 represent the ischiatic bones of Iladrosaurus. While engaged in 

 the Central Park, in developing the external form of this former 

 inhabitant of New Jersey, Mr. Hawkins found it necessary to 

 renew the whole question as to the component parts of the pelvic 

 arch of these giants, which he practically tested with casts from 

 the actual fossils, endeavoring to ascertain their true position 

 according to both Dr. Leidy's and Prof Huxley's views. In this 

 attempt he utterly failed, finding it impossible to place these 

 fugitive bones in such relationsliip to the gigantic femur as would 

 enable either animal to make footprints similar to tiiose found 

 both in England and America. This being the case at the moment 

 when the iconoclastic Central Park Commission declined allow- 

 ing the further prosecution of paleozoic studies in tlie Park, the 

 inquir}' was not continued until the opportunit}' was afforded by 

 the trustees of the New Jersey College at Princeton, who desired 

 to possess for their new museum one of Mr. Hawkins's restorations 

 of an extinct animal of New Jersey. For this purpose they 

 selected Hadrosaurus, which enabled Mr. H. to again investigate 

 the true position of the bones in question, which he has finall}' 

 placed as the analogues of the abdominal plastron-like supports, 

 found largely' developed in the pelvic region of the alligator. 

 This position of the bones, when united with the bipedal carriage 

 of the body, suggested immediately an analog}'^ between these 

 fugitive bones and marsupial bones of the Didelphidpe. These 

 remarks were illustrated by Mr. Hawkins in his usual manner 

 by crayon drawings on the slate. 



Prof. Cope stated that he was still of the opinion that the evi- 

 dence derived from Laelops and Megadactylus rendered it neces- 

 sary to believe in the backward direction of these bones in Hadro- 

 saurus. 



Prof. Cope desci'ibed a species of Dipnoan fish of the genus 

 Ctenodus from the coal measures of Ohio, based on specimens 

 placed in his hands by Prof Newlierry, as follows : — 



The top of the head is covered with angular plates or scuta, 

 arranged in the following manner on the region presented. Two 

 symmetrical scuta occupy the median line, one in front of the 

 other. One of these is a longish coffin-shaped hexagonal, with 

 the suture with the other concave. The latter is more ovoid, 

 broad and convex next tiie first mentioned, and somewhat more 

 contracted at the opposite extremity. Beyond this are two shields 

 joining by a straight suture on tlie middle line ; besides this one, 

 they have two concave sutures for scuta, at the fartlier end two 

 concave lateral sutures, and a straight one to the adjoining me- 

 dian scutum, whose suture is also concave. On each side of this 

 median plate is a large area surrounded before outvvards, and

 beiiind. Commencing with the first. No. 1 has already been de- 

 scribed. No. 2 is small, oval, and antero-posterior ; No. o is an 

 antero-posterior pentagon, with the narrowest side Inwards. No. 

 4 is a similar transverse pentagon. No. 5 is an antero-posterior 

 pentagon, which presents its shorter lateral facet inwards. No. 6 

 has a similar character, but is smaller an<l with more definite an- 

 gles. Another series of scuta is seen outside of these at one end 

 of the series. Three of this set bound the front and side of each 

 of the median pair above mentioned, leaving a short facet next 

 its fellow vmaccounted for. The sculpture consists of radiating 

 ridges and tubercles, which are most broken near the centres of 

 the scuta. The tubercles and ridges are obtuse and low, and the 

 latter do not inosculate. An angular depression commenced at 

 the middle of each lateral area, and extends across the middle line 

 at the point of junction of the paired and single median scuta.

Permission having been granted (the meeting being for busi- 

 ness). Prof. Persifor Frazer, Jr., made the following remarks : — 



In the investigation of the chemical formulas of minerals, the 

 student will meet with two kinds of difficulties. The first is the 

 great variations in the analysis, and the next is the connecting to- 

 gether in the formula for the particular mineral of diflferent com- 

 pounds by the sign -|-. The first of these diflSculties is a neces- 

 sary consequence of the manner of formation and occurrence of 

 minerals in the midst of solutions of other materials, and conse- 

 quently subjected to mechanical and chemical conditions tending 

 to add impurities to it, (whether by percolations through its open 

 joints, crevices, and pores, or by oxidizing or partially decompos- 

 ing it). 



The first results of the best processes of mechanical separation 

 merely reduce to a low per cent, the admixture of one mineral 

 with another of greatly different sp. gr., and even the best known 

 chemical methods can never succeed in producing an absolutely 

 and theoretically pure substance. So much less probable is it that 

 the deposits of compounds by the mechanical and chemical pro- 

 cesses which a change of the conditions of the surrounding nature 

 have caused, and which have not been bottled up in impervious 

 glass jars, but left to the action of the rain and sun and subter- 



a 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 93 



ranean solutions, should even acquire more than a relative purit3\ 

 So that when we glance over the analysis of the same mineral 

 made b}' different chemists, it is often hard to say which elements 

 are those characteristic of the species. (See Glauconite, Conarite, 

 Beudantite, etc. etc.) 



In some cases, the admixture of the two minerals can be proved 

 to be mechanical (gold dust in magnetic sand) ; in others it is 

 merely strongly suspected, but the mineral cannot be separated 

 by mechanical means (gold in pyrites, etc.)., while in the great 

 majority of cases the formula maker contents himself with two 

 arrangements of the atoms present connected by the sign +? a^^d 

 each representing a different mineral. 



It is this that forms one of the greatest difficulties to the stu- 

 dent, at the present state of science, in forming any probable 

 conception of the mutual chemical relations of the various ele- 

 ments represented. Such an hypothesis is certainly tenable in 

 two cases : 1st. When the resulting mass cannot be classed under 

 any of the crystal systems (limonite, etc.) and the mineral is set 

 down as amorphous or crystalline; and 2d. Where the percentage 

 of one or two of the supposed compounds is so suiall that the 

 morphological properties of that which greatly preponderates are 

 assumed by the whole mass. ( Quartz containing scales of specular 

 iron or needles of rutilite.) But when a mineral crj^stallizes dis- 

 tinctly in one crystal system and is deliberately assumed to be 

 made up of two others, each ci-ystallizing in a different one, the 

 case is exceedingly perplexing to the mind. Yet the greater 

 number of all the formulas determined by chemists exhibit this 

 anomaly. 



It was not surpi-ising that this should be the case at a time 

 when the electro-polar theory of Berzelius was unquestioned, and 

 the bases and acids were placed opposite each other — frequently 

 separated by the -f sign — like the partners in a Virginia Reel, 

 and it was thought necessary to make them analogous b^^ dividing 

 the oxygen between them. CaO, SO3 (anhydrite) or CaO + SO3 

 which has a crystal form differing from that of SO3 and CaO seems 

 to justify (Ag.S),, -f Sb.jS^ (proustite)., for in this latter case the 

 mineral is rhombohedral (hexagonal) while one of its constituents 

 crystallizes isometric and the other rhombic. It is true that this 

 mineral belongs to the class of those of metallic habit, and is 

 therefore opaque, and thus its optical pi'operties cannot be deter- 

 mined, but if it were transparent we should be under the necessity 

 of recognizing the power of a mineral which can only produce 

 the ordinarily refracted ray -f one that can produce two extraor- 

 dinary raj's to form a mineral which can give rise to one extraor- 

 dinar^r ray, and so of pleochroism, etc. In this case the fancy is 

 pleased by the accidental coincidence of the crystal form of the 



resultant with the average of the other two — '^-^ = 1 ; but we 




94 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



know there is no basis for such a thought, and besides in other cases 

 the union of two simp]}- cr^-stallizing minerals produces one of 

 more complex morphology. 



Thus our authorities tell us that sternbergite which crystallizes 

 orthorombic is to be written chemically Ag,S + (FeS).^ -f- FeS.^, 

 or in other words, is composed of three minerals, two of which 

 (Ag.,S and FeS.,) crystallize in the isometric sj^stem, and the third 

 has no place in nature and no name. 



I propose at a future meeting of the Academy to call the atten- 

 tion of the mineralogists to several formulas which, though new, 

 seem to fulfil all the conditions of agreement with analysis and 

 the newest developments of theoretical chemistry. 



The following anatomical notes by Dr. Chapman were read : — 

 Disposition of (he Latissimus Dorsi^ ^etc., in Afeles Geoffroyi 

 (Kiihl) and Macacus Rhesus {Desmarest). — Frequentl}^ the atten- 

 tion of anatomists is called to the abnormal arrangement of i)arts, 

 such as variations in the disposition of muscles, arteries, etc., and 

 by comparison with other animals what is abnormal, variable, in a 

 higher animal is usually found to be normal, constant, in a lower 

 one. Supposing the theor^^ of the evolution of life to be true, 

 that the higher animals are the modified descendants of the lower, 

 we have some explanation for the occurrence of such abnormalties, 

 these variations being reversions to ancestral types. An interest- 

 ing illustration of this view is seen in the occasional occurrence in 

 man of a muscular slip, running from the latissimus dorsi to the 

 internal condyle of the humerus. This muscle, which is of very 

 rare occurrence in the human subject, is constant in monkeys, 

 among others in the spider monkey or Ateles, as shown in Plate 

 13, Fig. 1 {&). Another variation met with so frequently in the 

 human subject that surgeons have their attention called to it with 

 reference to the ligation of the main arteries, is the presence of a 

 muscular slip, passing from the latissimus dorsi across the axil- 

 lary artery and nerves to the pectoralis major. This muscle, Plate 

 13, Fig. 2 (c), is constant in tiie Macacus, which also exhibits the 

 muscular slip (6), just referred to in Ateles. On the supposition 

 that man and the monkeys are the descendants of a common 

 stock, we may expect to find such variations recurring like otlier 

 family traits. 



Flexor Brevis Digitorum in Ateles Geoffroyi {Rube). — I take the 

 opportunity of calling attention to the arrangement of the flexor 

 brevis digitorum in a spider monkey, the Ateles Geotfroyi. By 

 looking at Plate 14, we see that tendons 1 and 2 are the continua- 

 tion of the muscular belly rising from the calcaneum, that tendon 

 3 results from the union of two muscular slips, one from («), the 

 other from the tendinous portion of the flexor longus digitorum, 

 while tendon 4 comes only from tendon of flexor longus digitorum. 

 This arrangement of the tendon of the flexor brevis digitorum is 

 somewhat different from that observed in other New World nion-

Rele Mirabile in Bradypus Didach/lus. — Of the many peculi- 

 arities in the organizations of the sloths, one of the most interest- 

 ing is the breaking up of the arteries into rete mirabile. This is 

 well seen in the upper extremity of a two-toed sloth {Bradypus 

 Didactylus) which recently died at the Zoological Garden, Phila- 

 delphia. While the axillary artery is seen to continue its course 

 as the brachial, diminished, however, in its calibre, it gives off 

 numerous branches which divide and subdivide. The main artery 

 with the surrounding plexus and the median nerve passes through 

 the internal condyle of the humerus, Plate 13, Fig. 3. In this 

 latter respect it differs from the tlii*ee-toed sloth, as may be seen 

 b^'^ comparison with the beautiful plates of Prof. Hyrtl. This in- 

 teresting disposition of the bloodvessels is also seen in the femoral 

 arteries of these animals. Various explanations have been offered 

 for the rete mirabile of arteries. Thus in the Cetacea the dividing 

 and subdividing of the arteries appear to serve as reservoirs of 

 arterialized blood, enabling such animals as the porpoise, etc., to 

 remain for a long time under water. In the sloths and slow lemurs 

 this disposition of the bloodvessels seems to be in relation with 

 the slowness of the circulation, fluids travelling less rapidly 

 through a number of small vessels than one large one. 



On report of the Committee to which it was referred, the fol= 

 lowing paper was ordered to be published : —

ON HABITS OF SOME AMEEICAN SPECIES OF BIRDS. 

 BY THOS. G. GENTRY. 



The body of facts contained herein is the result of observations 

 carried through a period of four consecutive seasons, and is con- 

 fined to species which, though of extended range, breed within the 

 State of Pennsylvania. This paper is designed to cover the ground 

 from the Family Icteridee to^the end of the Family Ficarise, ex- 

 clusive of western species and a few whose habits have been de- 

 scribed by the writer in the forthcoming work of Dr. Coues. 



Family ICTERID^. 



Subfamil}^ Agel^in^. 

 Molothruis pecoris, Swainson. 



This well-known species, though an early visitor in Massachu- 

 setts, which, according to the authority of Samuels, makes its ap- 

 pearance there as early as the middle of March, from some cause 

 or other has never been observed by the writer earlier than the 

 second week of April, long after the blue-birds, robins, and black- 

 birds have made the fields and woods resound with their music. 

 Its arrival is announced by the coming of the warblers and spar- 

 rows, between whom and it exists such mysterious relations. 

 The anomalous habit which the female possesses of visiting the 

 nests of smaller species of birds when she wishes to deposit her 

 eggs, and thus shifting a responsibility which she should alone 

 assume, is familar to all. There is no doubt that primitively all 

 species were as equally social and gregarious in their habits as the 

 cow-bird of to-day ; and that the present system of mating, which 

 is surely an index of a high state of improvement, has been 

 gradually evolved. The art of nest-building has doubtless also 

 been slowly acquired. In some families it has attained a wonder- 

 ful degree of perfection, while in others it may be said to be in its 

 infancy. With the cow-bird either it has never been studied, so 

 to speak, or else it is a lost art which the species has never been 

 able to regain. 



The species of birds which seem to be the objects of its special 

 regard, are comprehended within the three great families of the 

 Sylvicolidae, Vireonidae, and Fringillidse; Geothlypis trichan, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9T 



Cab.; Vireo olivaceus,Yiei\.; V. novahoracensis, Bonap; Cyano- 

 spiza cyanea, Baird ; and Melospiza melodia, Baird. Wh}- the 

 small birds should be the recipients of such unsolicited favors it 

 would be difficult to guess, unless the cowardly spirit of the 

 species under consideration operates to prevent similar discour- 

 tesies being shown where they would probably be resented. As 

 a proof of said cowardice, might be cited the stealthy manner in 

 which the female approaches the nest of any of the above species. 

 She is ever on the alert for fear of detection by the rightful 

 owners. In case of discovery she takes to flight, sometimes fail- 

 ing to complete her work ; but when suddenly pressed, she is 

 compelled to drop her egg. This will account for the eggs which 

 are occasionally seen either entire or broken upon the ground. 

 It is said that the egg of the cow-bird hatches rather sooner than 

 those of the birds, among which it is found, and from this it is 

 argued by some, that it is a wise provision of nature, which, 

 were it otherwise ordered, would defeat the end she had in view. 

 The writer knows from experience that sometimes a nest of eggs 

 is a longer time in hatching than at others; the difference of time 

 being the evident result of variation in the amount of heat to 

 which they are subjected. Xow, the egg of the cow-bird being 

 perceptibl}' larger than the others, would receive more heat from 

 the body of the female than the latter's own, for the simple reason 

 that it is in closer proximity to the source of heat. This seems to 

 be a satisfactorj" explanation of its much shorter period of incuba- 

 tion. Were the eggs hatched by their rightful author, there is no 

 doubt that the time would vary but a trifle, if any, from that of 

 the rusty black-bird. 



Agelaieus phoeniceus, Vieil. 



At the time of writing, March 24th, not a single individual of 

 this species is to be seen, while the purple grakle is. found in pro- 

 digious numbers. About the first of April is the usual time of its 

 appearance with us. Like the crow-black-bird, it is fond of society, 

 many pairs being observed building within a few paces of each 

 other in the same swamp or meadow. Occasionally a nest is 

 constructed within a tussock of grass, but generally upon the 

 alder bushes so common along the borders of meadow streams, 

 where the eggs and 3'oung are less liable to the attacks of snakes, 

 particularly Bascanion constrictor and Tropidonotus sipedon which 

 seem to have such a decided penchant for such fare. 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



In structure those found upon hushes are finer and more com- 

 pact. On^the exterior are observed occasional patches of mud. 

 While those built upon the small mounds in swampy situations are 

 surrounded by tall overarching grasses, and have in consequence 

 a looseness of arrangement which in general will scarcely bear 

 manipulation. 



In the selection of a locality there is manifest an evidence of 

 design. High grounds are seldom chosen for nidification, for the 

 obvions reason that the birds are not so apt to meet with such a 

 ready and full supply of the various species of insects which pander 

 to their appetites and those of their j-oung as in the former situa- 

 tions. The insects which afford them a living in such localities, are 

 the aquatic larvie of ephemerids, clragonflies, and mosquitoes which 

 are found in the small shallow pools so abundant therein ; together 

 with mature forms of the same — a variety which the most fastidi- 

 ous hon vivant among the aves cannot fail to appreciate. 



It has been affirmed that the red wings are destructive to far- 

 mers' crops, but as far as the writer's experience extends, the 

 damage which they do is small in comparison wuth the good 

 which they accomplish. When a cornfield is in close proximity 

 to a meadow, it is probable that a few grains may be exhumed, or 

 a few tender shoots uprooted, in early spring, but I am certain that 

 the birds during the breeding season are so strongly attached to 

 the meadows that they are reluctant to leave them. In the fall 

 of the year they may visit the cornfields and pluck a few grains 

 from the standing shocks, but in view of the manifold advantages 

 gained by the myriads of insects destroj^ed, we should not grudge 

 them a mere pittance of corn, since, at this season of the 3'ear, 

 thej^ are doubtless productive of immense good in the destruction 

 of various coleopterous and lepidopterous larvse. 



Sturnella magna, Swainsun. 



This beautiful species, though quite common in this latitude 

 during the breeding season, according to the writer's observations 

 makes its appearance from the first to the fifteenth of April. It 

 is not gregarious in early spring like the purple grakle, but ar- 

 rives from the south already paired for the essential duties of 

 nidification and incubation. It does not commence building ope- 

 rations, however, earlier than the last of April or the beginning of 

 May; the interval of time being employed, judging from the 

 manoeuvres of the birds, in the selection of a desirable and suit- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 99 



able locality. The site chosen is, as is well known, a meadow. 

 Samuels affirms, "the localit}- is generally in a meadow or low 

 field." I have as often found the nest on upland in a field of red 

 clover or one of timothy grass. In such situations it reposes in 

 a concavity of the earth, partially hidden and protected b}' en- 

 veloping and over-arching grasses. Nuttall's description thereof, 

 though correct in his day, according to the writer's experience 

 needs some modification. As the nest of the same species varies 

 with a change of locality, this difference ma}- be attributed thereto. 

 According to that eminent authorit}^ " it is compact, made of wiry 

 grass, to which a hidden and almost winding path is made, and 

 generally so well concealed that tlie nest is onl}' to be found when 

 the bird is flushed." I have always ' observed a looseness of 

 arrangement in its structure. The materials out of which it is 

 built are the hollow stems and leaves of Phleum pratense. These 

 are accumulated principally in the bottom, to insure protection 

 against the dampness of the ground. 



It is seldom that the hen bird can be detected on the nest. 

 When alarmed by approaching footsteps, there is no sudden up- 

 rising or whirring of wings as is usual. Aware of danger, she 

 quietly slips out of the nest and noiselessly wends her way through 

 the thicket of grasses, along well-beaten paths which she has made 

 for the purpose. 



The food of the meadow lark consists chiefly of larval insects, 

 together with earthworms, beetles, grasshoppers, and the seeds of 

 grasses. Nuttall sa^'s it does not appear that it ever adds berries 

 or fruits to its bill of fare. The writer is confident he has seen it 

 feasting upon the small black cherry which is so plentiful during 

 the month of June. The period of incubation is from 14 to 15 

 days according to various observations. 



Subfamily Icterin^. 

 Icterus spurius, Bonap. 



The orchard oriole is quite as common as its near relative. It 

 reaches us from the genial South about the first of May. Samuels, 

 in describing its nest in Massachusetts, says substantially, it is 

 deposited on a forked branch of a tree in an orchard, at an eleva- 

 tion of not more than twenty feet from the ground, and constructed 

 of different grasses neatly and compactly woven together; the whole 




100 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



being lined with fine grasses and a few hairs. Further, he says, 

 "it is not pensile but built on a branch." Its style of architecture 

 varies no doubt with the latitude. Of the many nests which 

 have been examined, including many in the writer's collection, all 

 with but one or two exceptions were of a decidedly pensile char- 

 acter; uniform in texture, and suspended from slender branchlets 

 after the fashion of Icterus Baltimore, Dandin. The exceptional 

 cases were placed between the forked branches of trees. These 

 nests, with two exceptions, have been found upon apple and 

 pear trees, in close proximity to the residence of man ; the ex- 

 ceptions were noticed on the confines of forests, at considerable 

 distances therefrom. There is no doubt that in earlier times this 

 oriole was as timid and suspicious of man as many other species 

 that might be cited ; and that as time advanced it gradually lost 

 all fear. Familiarity with man, the result no doubt of many 

 years' experience, has taught it to regard him in the light of a 

 friend. In the fact that the nest of this species is occasionally 

 found on the borders of immense thickets, we have a clue to its 

 past history. In the writer's opinion, reserve, timidity, and dis- 

 trust were then the leading elements of its character, while famili- 

 arity, a certain degree of boldness and confidence are traits which 

 now stand prominently forth. 



A typical nest of the species measures 2^ inches in diameter 

 and 4i inches in depth. It is pouch-shaped, and attached to the 

 slender twigs of an apple or pear tree in such a manner as to be 

 swayed to and fro by the gentlest breeze. It is built of the soft 

 and flexible leaves of a species of Poa, neatly and compactly 

 woven together, and lined on the inner side with much narrower 

 leaves of a closelj^ allied species. The site selected is usually one 

 where the small spurs of the pear and apple, principally the former, 

 with their crowns of leaves can meet over the nest and form a roof 

 to protect the female and young from inclement weather. 



During the breeding season its chief food is beetles, flies, lepi- 

 doptera, earthworms, and various larvae. The seeds of grasses 

 are occasionally relished. It is highly insectivorous in its nature. 

 I am not able to say whether it has a fondness for fruits and 

 berries, but am inclined to the belief that it will not refuse a juicy 

 berry if thrown within its way; but that it will not put itself to 

 any inconvenience to obtain the same I am well aware. 



In the duties of incubation the male takes no direct part. I 



1 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



have often observed him bringing food to the female while thus 

 engaged. When the young have developed from the egg, both 

 parents are extremely sedulous in their attention to them until 

 they have attained their feathered stage, when the motlier seems 

 to hand them over to the father to initiate into the mysteries of 

 aerial navigation. There is but one brood in the season, as far as 

 I have been able to determine, although I have seen nests in the 

 early part of August with rather tender fledglings. The period 

 of incubation ranges from fourteen to fifteen days. 



Family CORYID^. 

 Corvus Americanus, Audubon. 



The above species is very abundant throughout the summer in 

 this section of the country', and the writer has observed through 

 the severest winter weather numberless individuals roosting in 

 the junipers and cedars of the hills of the Wissahickon, when the 

 snow stood several inches upon the ground. The birds commence 

 pairing about the last of April, seldom earlier than the fifteenth, 

 and shortly afterwards commence building. The nests are usually 

 built upon the various species of oaks, and occasionally upon 

 some of Pinus. They are large in dimensions, fully 18 inches in 

 diameter at the base, and from 8 to 10 inches in depth ; the thick- 

 ness of the walls is from 3 to 4 inches. They are constructed of 

 coarse rude sticks externally, of the thickness of a lady's ring 

 finger, mostly fragments of dead branches that had fallen from 

 the oaks and chestnut. Within are smaller twigs of the same 

 covered by a few dried leaves of Quercus and Fagus to relieve its 

 hardness. All the nests that I have examined, and I have had 

 abundant opportunities, answer to the above description, which 

 will be found to differ materially from others. Usually but one 

 brood is reared in a season ; the writer has met with two, but 

 this is of rare occurrence. 



Nests have been taken close by the dwellings of man, showing 

 the friendly disposition of the authors. Usually the species is 

 very shy and builds in places seldom visited. When with young 

 the birds are very pugnacious, permitting no intrusion within 

 their jurisdiction. They manifest the most tender regard for their 

 progeny, and exercise the most jealous care over them. Notwith- 

 standing the mischief they commit to the farmers' crops, and their 

 frequent raids to the poultrj'^ yards, the good which they accom-

plish in the destruction of noxious insects and small animals 

 should commend them to public favor. Besides subsisting upon 

 insects, small animals, carrion, grass, and fruits, I have in two 

 instances-observed individuals, which I took to be males, imitating 

 the habit of their nearest kin, the flsh crow, by plying the trade of 

 •fishers. There is no doubt that in the case of Corvus ossifragus, 

 this habit was similarly acquired b}' a few birds of more sagacity 

 than others. The period of incubation I have not satisfactorily 

 determined, but am confident that it cannot exceed eighteen days. 



Corvus ossifragus. 



This species, though assigned to the South Atlantic and Grulf 

 States by Dr. Coues in his Key to North American Birds, has 

 been observed by the writer during the past four j^ears to breed 

 within the rural districts of Philadelphia. Although designated ' 



by the same great authority as a maritime species, yet it should 

 be considered onl}'^ partially so. It has been observed in company 

 with its near relative the common crow, and commences building ^i, 



at the same period. Its nest, unlike that of the crow, is constructed 

 upon a willow, by the side of a watercourse, where it can ply its 

 piscine trade without being molested. Externally, it consists of 

 a few rude sticks as a sort of foundation, upon which a neat and 

 comfortable superstructure, composed of the inner fibrous parts ' 



of the red cedar, is placed, loosely arranged, the whole present- 

 ing a neater and more fastidious appearance than that of the 

 common crow. The eggs are four in number. The ground-color 

 is a light blue marked with a few dots and blotches of umber- 

 brown on the small end, which are more or less confluent on the 

 large one, obscuring to a considerable extent the background. In .1 



size they are but little superior to the eggs of the purple grakle, 

 being about 1.40 in. in length, and .89 in width. In configuration 

 they bear a very close resemblance to those of the great crested Fly 

 Catcher, being almost perfectly oval. There is a marked contrast 

 between tlie eggs of ossifragus and Americanus in size, shape, 

 and markings, sufficiently striking to convince one of the distinct- 

 ness of the two species, even though other details should be 

 wanting. I have never met with more tlian one brood in a season. 

 It is like its cousin in some points of character, but minus its 

 thievish propensities. A fisher by trade, it holds all other occupa- 

 tions at a discount. It is fond of its young, but has not the 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



courage to defend them against the attacks of enemies, as the 

 former. Since it breeds usually in out-of-the-way situations/ it 

 can give farmers and others but little annoyance. Its period of 

 incubation is similar to that of Americanus. 



Family TYRANNID-^. 



Tyrannus Carolinensis, Baird. 



The Bee Martin, shortly after its arrival in the latter part of 

 April, commences building. Its nest is ordinarily constructed 

 upon the forked branches of a pear tree in an orchard, or in close 

 proximity thereto. Wliy tlie pear tree should be selected in 

 preference to any other, the apple and cherry for examples, it is 

 difficult to imagine, unless the density of its foliage, and the short 

 spine-like twigs with which the branches are armed, afford greater 

 l^rotection ; the former from the keen gaze of rapacious birds, and 

 the latter from mischief-seeking and mischief-loving boys. It is 

 usually built near the top of the tree where the denser foliage is 

 found. Occasional!}', I have taken nests of this species in places 

 remote from orchards, on the confines of thick forests, a fact which 

 seems to intimate that the habit of building in orchards is an 

 acquired one, brought about in obedience to a change of character 

 in the species. As it has a passion for the little Apis mellifica 

 w^iose hives are found in sucli situations, there is no doubt that a 

 desire to be near such articles of luxury may have prompted a 

 change, thereby saving unnecessary waste of time in procurement, 

 and giving a better guarantee of success. It is true that the 

 species is proverbial for its pugnacity and pertinacity', not even 

 fearing to attack birds of prey which come within the precincts of 

 the ground over which it exercises sway, and, therefore, the 

 securities which a pear tree throws around are not absolutely 

 necessary. But birds of the least sagacity would not be slow to 

 perceive the advantage whicli would be gained by the selection of 

 such a site, in the saving of great ph3'sical labor. In the vicinity 

 of forests these protective objects are in a measure denied, the 

 birds in consequence making up in bravery. Perhaps a vivid 

 sense of greater danger to their young induces them to give them 

 the advantage of everything protective that wisdom and ingenuity 

 can devise. There is one feature about the nests which have been 

 found in regions unoccupied by man that has not been observed 

 in those adjoining his residence : the entire absence of feathers 




104 PROCEEDINGS OE THE ACADEMY OF 



and hairs in the interior; tliese articles being substituted by line 

 grasses and leaves. The period of incubation ranges from 13 to 

 14 days according to circumstances. 

 Myiarchus crinitis, Cab. 



This species is very abundant in this latitude, arriving from the 

 South during the early part of Ma}', and shortly afterwards 

 pairing. Both birds engage in nest building. The nest is con- 

 structed in a hollow tree, mostly a pear or an apple ; no doubt 

 the previous labor of some hard-working wood-pecker, possibly 

 Colapfes auratus. Mr. Samuels sa3's, "the nests are composed of 

 straws, leaves, feathers, and the cast-off skins of snakes." He 

 further affirms, "it seems a distinguishing characteristic of the 

 nests of this species, to have the skins of one or more snakes 

 woven into the other materials." This has also been the expe- 

 rience of others. Mine has been quite different. I have yearly 

 collected many nests of this species, and find a great difference 

 in the materials. The following is the aggregate description : 

 Loose in arrangement, with scarcely the slightest evidence of 

 design. To an observer, it seems as if the materials had been 

 dropped into the cavity by the birds, and, when a sufficient quan- 

 tity had been accumulated, the whole had been shaken together 

 until the ingredients had been thoroughly commingled. Dried 

 grasses, liber of trees, rotten wood, and feathers are the chief 

 constituents ; the slough of snakes being an unnoticeable feature. 

 In lieu thereof, I have always found the feathers of the common 

 barnyard fowl to be a characteristic feature thereof. 



That this species does not always build in cavities is certain. 

 Two years ago, near Germantown, I found a nest built between 

 the forked branches of an apple ^'ee. It was composed princi- 

 \isil\y of the feathers of chickens, held in place by a woof of long 

 grasses. Though not ver^' compact, yet it was sufficiently so to 

 last during the season. It is doubtful, however, whether it could 

 withstand the peltings of winter. The habit of building within 

 the hollows of trees is doubtless an acquired one, rendered neces- 

 sary b}' external circumstances. That species do occasionally 

 vary in the selection of a site for a nest, is instanced by Tardus 

 migratorius, Lin., which, as is well known, ordinarily builds its 

 mud-plastered nest within the forked branches of a tree. In the 

 case to which the writer refers, the nest was found upon the hori- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



zontal beam' of an outhouse, to which the rafters are attached, 

 after the manner of Sayo7'nis fuscus, Baird. The case of J/, cri- 

 nitus cited above seems to the writer to be a case of reversiun of 

 habits. 



Why tliis species alone of all others of the famil}' to which it 

 belongs should seek shelter and protection for its 3'oung in the 

 hollows of trees, is hard to divine. We should expect to see in 

 its structure a family resemblance. It is true that it is of a 

 quarrelsome disposition, and as a necessary consequence, gains 

 many enemies. To insure protection for its young against the 

 latter's attacks, it has hit ujjon the happy expedient of hiding 

 them away in the places designated. 



The feathers selected for the nest are mostly white, or of a 

 grayish color, which, with the characteristic hue of the inner bark 

 of trees and the rotten wood that form the bulk of the nest, re- 

 semble so closel}' the ground color of the egg and its markings, 

 that great advantage is gained thereby. The food of this species 

 is mostly bees, beetles, grasshoppers, and lepidoptera. Perched 

 upon a dead branch of a tree, the writer has observed the male 

 bird, for hours, bobbing the head this way and that, then up and 

 down, always on the alert for the beings which- form its appro- 

 priate diet. During the period when the species is with young, 

 may be noticed similar practices, which, however, are not so pro- 

 longed, for the male bird after brief periods of time repairs to the 

 nest with its spoils, which are dealt out to the female and the 

 young according to the character of the food. The period of in- 

 cubation ranges from 13 to 14 daj'S. 



Order PICARIiE. 

 Family CAPRIMULGID^. 



Subfamily Caprimulgin^. 

 Antrostomus vociferus, Bonap. 



This common and little known species arrives during the earl}^ 

 part of May, already paired. It is of a sh}' and retired disposition, 

 secluding itself during the daj'time in close forests, among the 

 leaves or underbrush, only venturing forth during the shadowj' 

 twilight in quest of its food, which consists of crepuscular and 

 nocturnal lepidoptera and various species of Phyllophagous 

 beetles. Such a partiality has it for the covert of woods that the

writer has never startled it in the open fields. The dull and 

 sombre shadows cast upon the ground by the flattering leaves of 

 the trees, with the faint streaks of light that come and go between 

 their interstices, combined with the dark colors of the leaves that 

 repose upon the soil, create a sort of gray light, which beautifully 

 harmonizes with the natural tints of the bird. In my travels I 

 have often observed a whip-poor-will to start up within fifteen 

 paces of me, and after flying a short distance on swift and noise- 

 less pinions, to alight upon the ground. After indicating the spot 

 by a certain bush or fallen limb, I have stealthily approached, 

 straining my vision to its utmost capacity to gain a glimpse of 

 the squatting bird, but before I could gratify my desire, she 

 was up and ofi" again. Time after time has been so spent, but 

 seldom has it been my fortune to witness the consummation 

 of this desire. It has never been my lot to see the male and 

 female together during the period of incubation. The merest 

 apology of a nest is all that is constructed. By the side of a 

 fallen and decayed log, usually on the side where the deepest 

 shadow is found, the female has been observed to deposit her 

 eggs. A slight concavity is scooped out by her, and frequently 

 lined with decayed wood, reduced to a powdered condition, the 

 site being selected where a ready supply of the material is at hand. 

 There is never more than one brood in a season. The period of 

 incubation ranges from fourteen to fifteen days. I have often 

 been surprised while travelling to notice how conscious it is of 

 approaching steps even when the greatest caution is observed to 

 avoid giving alarm. Its visual organs being ill-adapted to the 

 light of day, and even the mellowed light of the woods being too 

 powerful a stimulus, it is certain that it must depend upon other 

 means for the detection of danger. The organ of hearing, which 

 is well developed, is assuredly called into requisition. This species 

 makes its appearance rather late in the season, when the sun has 

 obtained considerable power, and retires early, frequently as early 

 as the 25th of September.

during the early part of ^iciy, about the time the horse chestnut 

 (^sculus liippocastanum) spreads its rich clusters of fragrant 

 blossoms to the vernal breezes. The small insects which frequent 

 the blossoms for their hone}', together -with the hone}- itself, afford 

 it a rich repast. It commences building during the early part of 

 June, both birds working assiduously until the nest is completed. 

 In the spring of 1812, Master Charles Silverthorn, one of the 

 writer's pupils, secured for the latter's collection at least fifteen 

 nests, from a district scarcely one-fourth of a mile in diameter, 

 thus showing the abundance of the species in this latitude. Some 

 of these nests were saddled upon the moss-covered branches of an 

 apple or pear tree, while the major part of them was found upon 

 the branches of various species of oaks, chiefly Quercus rubra and 

 Quercus alba. They were^ constructed of a woollj' substance of 

 vegetable origin, plucked from the leaves of Verbascum tha2:>sus, 

 L,, of almost immaculate whiteness. It is doubtful whether the 

 soft down which appears upon the nnexpanded leaves of the pop- 

 lars is utilized, since the leaves are already developed in the gene- 

 rality of cases when nidification commences. The exterior of the 

 nest is compactly covered by a thatching of bluish-colored lichens, 

 possibly a Parmelia, glued thereon by a A-iscid saliva, secreted by 

 the birds. I have never observed, as some, the small woody fibres 

 on the outside, which are said to strengthen the fabric. Occasion- 

 ally a few cobwebs have been noticed, but the manner in which 

 the lichens cohere seems to be all that is necessarj^ The nests are 

 usually 1.50 inch in diameter, with a dej^th of 1.T5 inch. Speci- 

 mens have been taken fully 2 inches in depth. The internal 

 cavity never exceeds | of an inch in depth, while instances are 

 known of small nests with less than ^ inch. The writer has taken 

 nests during the latter part of Juh', with eggs, but whether a 

 second set or not he is unable to say, possibly the work of pairs 

 that have been frustrated in their labors during the earlj' part of 

 the season. During the hatching period the male is in close 

 proximitj^ to the nest, and if any attempt is made to interfere 

 therewith, is foremost and loudest in his cries of resentment, and 

 even flies into the intruder's face with half opened jaws, requiring 

 considerable effort to beat him off. His mate is of a more passive 

 nature. The period of incubation, according to the writer's esti- 

 mate, is about eight days. So susceptible to cold is the species 




108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



that I have known it to leave for the sunn}' south as early as the 

 loth of September. 



Family CUCIJLID^. 



Subfamily Coccyzin^. 

 Coccyzus Americanus. 



This species, a very common resident during the warm season, 

 arrives from the south during the latter part of April, and retires 

 to its genial warmth early in the fall, frequently as early as the 

 first of October. In this neighborhood the nest is usually con- 

 structed between the forked branches of 3Iaclura aurantiaca, at 

 an elevation of about ten feet from the ground. It is composed 

 externally of small sticks and rude grasses, and lined internally 

 with fine grasses. The male bird scarcely forsakes his mate during 

 incubation, save to provide himself and her with food. When not 

 thus engaged, he perches upon a limb of the same tree, within a 

 short distance of the nest, ever watchful of her, and apparently 

 ready to administer to her slightest calls. Feelings of the tender- 

 est sympathy and the most devoted affection are mutually ex- 

 hibited. It is not shy and timid in disposition, but shows con- 

 fidence in man by building close to his domains. In the spring 

 of 1812, from my school window I could command a view of a 

 nest of this species, and observe the minutest details of its every- 

 day life. My pupils frequently in their plays would pass under- 

 neath the tree, while the birds were engaged in building, but so 

 intent were they upon their work that they heeded not their 

 presence. The nest was completed, eggs were deposited and 

 hatched, and the 5^oung matured ; the parent birds evidently feel- 

 ing as secure as in more sequestered situations. Such friendship 

 as is here displayed should strike a sympathetic cord in the bosom 

 of relentless man, and induce him to throw around such unsus- 

 pecting creatures the asgis of his protection. The period of incu- 

 bation is fourteen daj^s. When the female is with young, the duty 

 of feeding devolves upon the male, who, with the instincts of a 

 faithful husband and father, administers with alacrity to their 

 physical wants.

Family PICID^. 



Melanerpes erytlirocephalus, Sw. 



This beautiful species is of rare occurrence in the vicinity of 

 Philadelphia during the breeding season. It is more abundant, 

 however, farther west. In the counties of Union and Northum- 

 berland, of the State of Pennsylvania, the writer has observed it 

 in great numbers. There it is the principal species, as Colaptes 

 auratus, Swainson, is in the east. It arrives seldom earlier than 

 the first week in Ma^^, and soon begins to excavate a cavity in a 

 tree for its nest. The place selected is ordinarily' an apple tree 

 close by the habitation of man, but occasionally a more secluded 

 and retired spot. The writer has often observed the nests in the 

 hollows of partially deca^'ed willows upon the margins of ponds. 

 The cavity ranges from ten to twelve inches in depth, being some- 

 what wider at the bottom than at the entrance ; the latter being 

 just wide enough to admit the l)ody of the bird. Dr. Thompson, 

 in his work entitled " Birds of Vermont," affirms that " the larger 

 end of the egg is marked with reddish spots." This variety I 

 have never oljserved. It ma}- be an exceptional occurrence in 

 more northern latitudes. From Samuels' description of the site 

 selected for nidification, it would seem that this species is of a 

 timid nature. Familiarity with its habits has convinced me that 

 it is remarkably unsuspicious, and courts rather than shuns the 

 society of man. In the month of August, not later than the 10th, 

 in the central part of this State, the writer has seen immense flocks 

 of this bird, numbering hundreds, within an apple orchard, tap- 

 ping the rough and fissured bark of the trees in quest of the insects 

 that lurk therein. So tame and confiding were they, that it was 

 possible to approach within a few paces of them without exciting 

 suspicion or creating alarm. In the vicinit}'- of the White Deer 

 Mountains, in the county of Union, they abound in immense num- 

 bers during the breeding season, and are the objects of protection 

 by the farmers, for the good which they accomplish in the destruc- 

 tion of mj'riads of insects. The period of incubation ranges from 

 fourteen to fifteen days. The usual complement of eggs is two, 

 occasionally three have been found.

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 

 Fifteen members present. 

 The death of Dr. Governeur Emei'son "n-as announced. 



Prof. Persifor Frazer, Jr., made the following remarks : — 



I had the honor, at the last meeting, of presenting to the Aca- 

 demy for its consideration, some attempts to reconcile the results 

 of the analyses of minerals b}- the best chemists with formulas, 

 which were constructed on the doctrine of quantivalence, i. e., the 

 known atom-saturating power of the elements. In my former 

 communication I endeavored to show that such a mixture of defi- 

 nite cliemical compounds (generally crystallizing in different sys- 

 tems) as was indicated b}' the greater number of the old formulas 

 could not have those characteristic physical properties which serve 

 to distinguish homogeneous bodies from each other ; and above 

 all, that no mixture of two minerals cr^'stallizing in different sys- 

 tems could produce a third crystallizing in still another S3^stem. 

 I stated that there seemed to be onl}^ two cases in which the for- 

 mation of minerals in this way is possible ; the one where one of 

 the compounds preponderates to such an extent that the resulting 

 mass is moulded according to its own morphological law ; and the 

 other where the resulting mass is not cr^^stallized at all, but at 

 most crystalline, i. e., made up of minute crj^stals or individuals 

 of each species, but simply aggregated together. 



That such is the explanation of many crystalline and crj-pto- 

 crystalline rocks the microscope has sufficiently demonstrated, 

 and it would hardly be going too far to say, that, wherever an 

 amorphous mineral shows such a cliemical constitution that its 

 elements cannot be brought into a single formula consistent with 

 what we already know of the behavior of its anion and cathion 

 radicals, a strong probability exists that the mineral is simply a 

 mixture. 



On this hypothesis of the case the circumstance cannot fail to 

 demand exi)lanation that the same mixtures in the same propor- 

 tions should so often occur with similar paragenesis ; and it is 

 not to be denied that this fact needs careful study. 



But in many instances the cause of this uniformity, itself appa- 

 rently the result of chance, is to be traced to disintegration of a 

 previousl}' existing mineral into two or more others, or the partial 

 alteration of one mineral into another throughout its wliole mass, 

 and by the action of outside forces. 



Thus chalcop^-rite might suffer partial decomposition into clial- 

 cocite and pyrite, or into tenorite and iiematite, or into all four of 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



these minerals, and while the mass could have no ciystal form of 

 its own, the mutual ratios of the resulting compounds ^yould be 

 more constant as the process of decomposition was more perfect. 



It often results that in calculating a formula for a so-called 

 species the results of analyses of specimens from widely distant 

 localities, and made by different persons, agree remarkably well 

 together, while the atomic ratio is such as to resist all efforts to 

 bring these atoms into one homogeneous compound Often, too, 

 the student sees clearly that he is dealing with a partially decom- 

 posed mass, and would, perhaps, be justified in writing "a, per 

 cent, of the mineral A with b, per cent, of the mineral B dissemi- 

 nated through it," but it is obvious that he must assign wide 

 limits to a and h; and if the species possess that patent of genuine- 

 ness, crystal form, unless he define those limits his formula loses 

 its value. 



Take the case of smaltite. This mineral has ver^^ well-marked 

 physical properties and unmistakable crj^stal form, and is an arse- 

 nate of cobalt, iron, and nickel, but its per cent, of As varies from 

 59 per cent. (Salvetal & Wertheim) to about 75 per cent. (Karsten) ; 

 the Co from per cent. (Rammelsberg) to 20 per cent. (Stro- 

 meyer) ; the Xi from per cent. (Yarrentrapp & Stromeyer) to 

 29.50 (Rammelsberg); the Fe from trace (Rammelsberg) to 18 

 (von Kobell) ; Cu from per cent. (Lange, Booth, Karsten, &c.) 

 to 2 per cent. (Jackel). Besides these very large varieties of com- 

 position there are frequently' found other elements with it, such 

 as Bi and S. llow is a formula to be constructed for such a 

 mineral ? 



The only recourse is to the R's, and we have no less than four 

 groups of formulas proposed by Dana, under one of whicli every 

 smaltite j'et anal3^zed can be brought. The first two of these are 

 really identical, and differ only in the different proportions in 

 which the analogous elements Ni, Co, and Fe, replace each other, 

 and may be written RAs.,. But the next group (C) has the for- 

 mula RAs + RAs_„ and the third (D) RAs, + RAs,,. 



ludependentl}' of tlie presumptive evidence against such a mix- 

 ture producing a beautiful octahedron of smaltite, where is to be the 

 limit to such formulas? Why not RAs -}- BAs, -(- T^ASg -|-.etc. ? 

 And would it not be well to adopt some more definite rule for 

 assigning formulas to minerals of such variable composition ? 



Without naming these laws certain facts can be assumed on 

 which to base them : 1st. If there is no single chemical formula 

 which expresses the constitution of a crystallized mineral, then 

 that mineral is a mixture. 2d. Its form is determined by the 

 pre|)onderance in quantitj' or in crystallizing power, or both, of 

 one of its constituents. 3d. The mineral can onl}' present its 

 characteristics when the foreign ingredients are present under a 

 given per cent. 



The plan would seem t<y be to deduce from the known charac- 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



teristics of the simpler couipounds which most resemble it, to 

 which of them it owed its morphological properties ; and, having 

 decided this question, to write the formula for that mineral as the 

 species, and consider the other as a complex variety of it. 



I append some few names of minerals with their old and new 

 rational formulas generally compared, and in addition to the usual 

 method of writing these new formulas I have added that form of 

 graphic symbol which presents fewest typographical difficulties.

Change of Habit in Sniilacina hifolia. — Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 remarked that this plant, as was well known, was iisualh' terres- 

 trial, preferring generall}^ the vicinity of large trees. It propagates 

 itself b}- iindergfound stolons, advancing but a few inches each 

 season ; the stolons of the preceding year dj'ing as soon as a new 

 one was made. He had recently seen a case where the stolons had 

 advanced from the ground, and up the trunk of a large chestnut 

 tree, to the height of about two feet; the original stolons for sev- 

 eral 3^ears back having died awaj', and the plant taken in a purely 

 Gpipbytal character. The roots and stolons mostly had penetrated 

 the coarse, rough bark of the chestnut tree, the leaves only being 

 chiefly visible. The fact is trifling, and in old times, perhaps, 

 ha rdlj'' worth recording; but in these days, when the change of 

 character in connection with the evolution of form had such a 

 general interest, even this was worth recording.

Prof. Cope stated that the snakes of the genns /S^orerm, B. and 

 G., ai-e viviparons like Euteenia and other tropidonotine genera 

 to which they are allied. He had frequently made this observa- 

 tion, but had not placed it on record so far as he knew. He also 

 stated that the Colorado potato beetle had probably terminated in 

 its eastern migration, as it had appeared prett}^ well distributed 

 in New Jersey the present season. 



Prof. Cope gave a synopsis of the result of his work in connec- 

 tion with Hayden's United States Geological Survey of the Terri- 

 tories during the season of 1873. He stated that the investigation 

 covered principally the paleontology of the cretaceous, eocene, 

 miocene, and pliocene periods in Colorado. The whole number 

 of species of vertebrata obtained was one hundred and fift}', of 

 which ninety-five were at the time new to science. The cretaceous 

 species were both terrestrial and marine, and the miocene were 

 most numerous. These numbered seventj^-five species, of which 

 fiftj^-seven were new. The^^ embraced, as especial additions to the 

 fauna, numerous reptiles and Mammalia of all the orders, espe- 

 cially Insectivora, Bodentia, and Garnivora. Important additions 

 were the gigantic horned Symhorodons, and numerous very small 

 ruminants allied to the Tragulidx. He stated that the discovery 

 of the latter added a stronger resemblance to the miocene of 

 Fi'ance than had been heretofore supposed to exist. The existence 

 of E loth erium and Anchitherium gave the fauna somewhat older 

 facies than that of France. 



He stated that the onl}'- genus of lizards that could be well 

 analyzed is the Peltosaurus, Cope, and that this proves to be a 

 member of the existing family of Gei^i'lionotidse^ which is now 

 confined to Mexico and California. Hence, like many rodents, 

 but unlike the higher mammalia, these miocene lizards had con- 

 tinued with but little modification to the present day. 



He also discussed the age of the Bridger eocene, stating that it 

 had been originally termed miocene by the geologists of King's 

 survey, and later lower miocene, or upper eocene, by Marsh. He 

 had published it as eocene in 1812, and contended that it presented 

 features which indicate a somewhat earlier age than that of the 

 Paris basin. He said that there were numerous parallels of cor- 

 responding genera in the two ; the Ifesonyx, Palaeosi/ops, Eyra- 

 chyus^Achdenodon, Hyopsodus^ and Ana2}tonio7'phus, of the Bridger 

 formation, represented the Hysenodon, Palseotherium, Lophiodon^ 

 Anthracotheriam, Hyracotherium^ and Adapis of the Paris basin 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



respectivel}'. The former was, however, entirely peculiar in its 

 JSobasiliidse, Baihmodonfidse, and Anchippodontidf£, and in its 

 almost entire want of artiodact^'les (none with crescent-bearing 

 teeth), while the French eocene possessed non-ruminating artio- 

 dactyles, with crescent-bearing teeth, in its numerous Anoplotherii- 

 dee and Hyopotamidse. He concluded that there were good reasons 

 for regarding the facies as older than that of the Paris basin.

Prof. Perstfor Frazer, Jr., made the following remarks : The 

 coal-cutting machine, designed by Mr. Jas. Brown, of Brazil, Ind,, 

 and photographs of which were kindly sent me by the inventor, 

 and are herewith offered for the inspection of the members, con- 

 sists of a steel or iron wheel set in a frame, connected witii the 

 pneumatic engine, which runs in rails laid parallel to the face of 

 the heading, which in this case may be several hundred yards 

 long. 



On the outer periphery of this wheel are arranged twenty or 

 thirty' triangular-shaped pieces of steel, united with it at one of 

 their apices by a pin. In the middle of the opposite side, which is 

 curved, are firmly fixed chilled-steel teeth, which set themselves 

 by friction against the coal to the proper position for cutting, as 

 the wheel is rotated to the right or left. The motion is imparted 

 hy means of a small-toothed wheel which moves in rackAvork on 

 the under surface of the wheel. 



The machine is suitable for the soft coals of jointed structure 

 (z. e., the black coals), and is operated hy causing the machine to 

 revolve against the face of an exposure, and at the same time 

 draw itself forward, by means of a rack and pinion attachment, 

 to a middle rail. When it has undercut the coal as far as it can, 

 it is caused to move sidewaj's along the pair of rails first men- 

 tioned until it has cut a channel an inch or two high, four and a 

 half feet deep, and as long as the breadth of the heading. The 

 blocks of coal are thus separated from the rest, except on two 

 sides, viz., the upper and the rear sides, and a skilful miner can 

 knock down with the pick huge cubical blocks, which are com- 

 paratively regular, and sufl^er less loss by attrition in transporta- 

 tion. 



As in all pneumatic machines the escaped air aids materially in 

 ventilating the mine.

Represented by three specimens. These are of slender form 

 with long tail and weak limbs. The digits are palmate to the tips. 

 The head is an elongate oval, and its width enters the length to 

 the groin more than six times. The end of the muzzle is tumid, 

 and notched in the middle; the external nostril pierces each tumidity 

 above the lip. The vomerine teeth are in two short arches meet- 

 ing in the middle and not extending outwards beyond the inner 

 margin of the inner nares. Parasphenoids numerous, the patches 

 not distinguished anteriorly. Thirteen costal folds, the oppressed 

 foot and thin limbs each extending over four of them. Tail swol- 

 len at the base, a vertical oval in section. A groove along the 

 median line of the back and tail. Dermal pores numerous. Color 

 uniform dark brown.

 Osteocephalus planiceps, sp. nov. 



A rather slender species, with long limbs, and the genei'al pro- 

 portions of tlie species of Hypsihoas. Head broad and plane on 

 the upper surface to the straight and rectangular canthus rostralis. 

 Loreal region nearlj' vertical. The fronto-parietal bones are ossi- 

 fied, and the nasals meet on the middle line ; their superior surface 

 is rugose with ossific deposit, which in some cases assumes the 

 form of radiating ridges, but nowhere penetrates the free derm. 

 The lateral margins of the fronto-parietals are indicated by deli- 

 cate angular ridges incurred posteriorly. The vomerine teeth 

 form two curved transverse series between the posterior portions 

 of the inner nares, the angle forwards the outer limb a little longer. 

 Choanse very large, ostia pharyngea half the size. Tongue oval, 

 bound behind. Ej'e large with transparent palpebra, its diameter 

 equal to the space between it and the nostril, one-fourth greater 

 than that of the large membranum tympani, and one-fourth less 

 than the frontal width. Bell}^ and sides coarsely' areolate, back 

 minutely tubercular. A short tubercular fold from orbit to behind 

 scapula. Fingers free ; toes webbed to the base of the penul- 

 timate phalange of the fourth digit ; first (least) toe webbed to 

 disk. The heel of the extended hind limb extends bej'ond the 

 muzzle by the diameter of the tympanum. No dermal fringes or 

 processes. 



Color above uniform dark brown, concealed surfaces of limits 

 similar and without any markings. Sides a little varied with the 

 white of the belt. A light border to the upper lip, and lighter 

 line -from the orbit to the angle of the mouth ; dermal scapular 

 fold pale edged. Femur and tibia with dark crossbauds on the 

 exposed surfaces.

 the inguinal gland, below which on the scapular region is a boss 

 like a parotid gland : A fold from the inner border of the ej^elid 

 to the end of the sacral diapoph3^sis ; a fold from the end of the 

 muzzle to the end of the coccyx on the median line. A short 

 conic tubercle stands at its extremity on the muzzle. Edge of the 

 eyebrow with three dermal processes or " horns." There is a ridge

 vomerine tooth series. The coloration is entirel}^ different. The 

 C. fasciahis, Peters, is equally distinct, judging from the descrip- 

 tion. 



Hylodes sulcatus, sp- nov. 



Distinguished for its very wide head and rugose skin. The 

 form is stout, but the hind limbs rather elongate. The maxillary 

 borders are so expanded as to give the t3^mpanic disks a partly 

 vertical exposure. These are vertically oval, the diameter a little 

 less than that of the orbit. The latter is a little less than the 

 length to the anterior nares. Choanre large, but little larger than 

 the ostia pharyngea. Vomerine teeth in two short curved series 

 entirely behind the choanse, and not extending outwards bej'ond 

 their middle ; they approach nearly inwards. Tongue round, entire, 

 one-third free. Fingers very short without expansions. Heel of 

 extended hind limb to nares ; expansions of hind toes well marked, 

 with T-shaped phalanges. A peculiarity of the species is seen in 

 the strong ridge that extends along the superciliary border to the 

 posterior border of the cranium, inclosing a groove with its fellow. 

 Skin below areolate on the belly ; above with numerous short, 

 generally symmetrical folds, two of which cross the suprascapular 

 region, two on the sides, two on each side the back, etc. The

One specimen from Nauta. 



This species has the cranial structure and xiphisternal style or 

 Cystignathus, but the T-shaped phalanges and disks of Hylodes. 

 The Pleciromanfis wagneri^ Peters, I have examined in Munich, 

 and find it to be closely allied to Cystignaihus, so far as external 

 appearances are concerned, but further than this I could not ex- 

 amine. It, however, has digital dilatations, and I refer the present 

 species, provisionally, to the same genus, suspecting that such 

 course will be warranted by a fuller investigation of the type spe- 

 cimen. As here defined, it bears the same relation to Cystignathus 

 that Hylorana does to Rana.

 Gnathophysa riibido, sp. nov. 



A much smaller species than the preceding, represented by two 

 males and a female, the former with the nuptial spurs largely de- 

 veloped. The metacarpus of the pollex terminates in one, and 

 the second projects from the metacarpus of the second digit. 

 There is one with three niucrones on each side of the breast. The 

 general form is stout. The toes are without free dermal margins, 

 and the smooth abdominal derm has the discoidal fold. The 

 vomerine teeth form two short transverse open arches behind the 

 nares, not extending outwards beyond, opposite the centres of the 

 latter. There is a dorsolateral fold from the orbit to near the 

 groin, and another, commencing just below it, extends to the mid- 

 dle of the side, and sends a short branch dow^n behind the mem- 

 branum tympani. Dorsal surface smooth, pustular between the . 

 ilia; tibia pustular above. The head is a wide oval, with a short 

 decurved muzzle, and large eyes. The diameter of the latter ex- 

 ceeds the length to .the outer nares, and is nearlj^ twice that of the 

 tympanic membrane. Tongue elongate oval, faintly notched, 

 choanoe and ostia near the same size. The heel of the extended 

 hind limb falls short of the orbit. The lateral glandular mass ex- 

 tends from near the axilla to the groin and occupies the width of 

 the side.

 Dendrobates trivittatus, Spix (?). 



This species agrees with the figure given by Spix, and differs 

 from the description by GUnther, of the D. tinctorius,, to which 

 the latter author refers it as a synonym. Thus the dorsal derm 

 is closely areolate, and the ventral smooth, and the first finger is 

 longer than the second. There are three longitudinal yellow 

 bands, the outer springing from the orbits, the median from 

 between them. The lateral extend to the knee, while another 

 band extends from the lips below the orbit to the middle of the 

 humerus. A yellow horse-shoe on the end of the muzzle; below 

 black, with yellow spots on the limbs only. Femur with few spots 

 behind.

 which falls behind the symphysis of the mandible. The e3'elid is 

 thickened, and is not prominent; and the diameter of the 03*6 

 equals the length of the muzzle and the posterior interorbital 

 width. The ethmoid appears to be ossified to the end of the 

 muzzle. Fingers slightly, toes largely webbed, the web reaching 

 the end of the first phalange of the fourth (long) toe. Tongue 

 narrow, extensively free ; ostia pharyngea smaller than the small 

 choanse. Skin smooth except on the sides, where there are 

 numerous closely-placed minute tubercles from the head to the 

 groin. A broad fold of skin extending from the side to the middle

 The head is longer and the femnr shorter than in the latter. The 

 coloration is notabl}^ distinct. In neither of these species do I 

 find the dorsolateral dermal fold of the B. a finis, though this may- 

 be due to the rather soft state of the specimens.

 The width in front of the pectoral spine is a little less than .25 of 

 the total length (including caudal fin) ; the length of the post- 

 coracoid process is equal to nearly two-thirds of the intei'space 

 between them. The raaxillar}' barbel extends to the end of the 

 basal third of the pectoral spine; the latter oppressed, reaches the 

 base of the ventx-al fins. Tail at anal fin wider than deep ; com- 

 pressed near the base of the caudal fin. Four rows of wartlets 

 on the sides, one of them on the lateral angle of the tail. Dorsal 

 fin nearer the end of the muzzle than the base of the caudal fin by 

 two-thirds the leno-th of its base.

 4. Dorsal fin bound to the back behind by its membrane, the 

 base of its first ray a little nearer the end of the muzzle than the 

 basis of the caudal fin. The head and neck shield is diamond- 

 shaped, with truncate angles, and the humeral angles mark the 

 middle of its length instead of an anterior point, as in Bunoce- 

 jjhalus nelas. The anterior humeral tuberosit}'' marks one-third 

 the length from the end of the muzzle to the second dorsal ray, 

 measured axially. The shield is peculiar for its strong ridges 

 and scalloped borders. A high heel, with three prominences, 

 divides it behind, while the scutum supports another. The poste- 

 rior border presents two angles, and there is a ridge across behind 

 the orbits. A ridge from each orbit meets its fellow, forming a V 

 at the occiput, and a ridge from the humeral process meets its 

 fellow behind this point. The postcoracoids are longer than in 

 B. melas., their length equalling the width between them. The 

 pectoral . spines extend beyond the base of the dentrals. The 

 maxillary barbels extend to the base of the pectoral spines. The 

 tail is quadrangular with a line of evantlets along the lateral 

 angle. Belly, tail, and fins, black ; throat and belly white speckled.

 The head enters the total length (with caudal) 5.75 times ; while 

 the greatest depth (in front of the dorsal fin) enters it eight times, 

 the head being measured to the superior end of the branchial fis- 

 sure. There is an obtuse canthus rostralis from the orbit to the 

 nares, there is a strong nuchal angle (not a crest), and a low one 

 corresponding to the outer border of the epiotic bone. The two 

 nuchal scuta have two very low ridges each. The orbit is small

Size of the last species but much more robust and rough in 

 character. The dorsal outlines arched, rising abruptly in a strong 

 crest on the posterior cephalic scutum, and maintained b^^ the 

 rough lateral keels of the nuchal plates. The head enters the 

 total length 4.25 times, and the greatest depth the same, five 

 times. An obtuse ridge to nares and a low swelling on the upper 

 part of the pterotic shield. There is an angular tuberosity on the

Dimorjjhism in the Leaves of Acer Peimsylvanicum^ Lin. — 

 Mr. Thomas Meehan exhibited some branches of Acer Pennsyl- 

 vanicum, Lin. {A. striatum^ Lamb), which had a remarkable sys- 

 tem of dimorphic foliage, and which he believed had been gener- 

 ally overlooked. 



The first pair of leaves developed after the bursting of the bud 

 in the spring, were larger and more perfectly developed than any 

 subsequent ones. In liis specimens the^^ were about six inches 

 long and five wide, and strongly three-lobed towards the apex. 

 The next pair, however, were usually lance linear, in the specimens 

 exhibited about five inches long and less than tw^o wide. Occa- 

 sionally there was a tendencj^ to the production of a pair of lobes, 

 but usually the margins were entire or sparsely serulated. The 

 third and subseqnent pairs of leaves partook of the form of the first 

 pair, though seldom so large. He had examined several hundred 

 of young trees, and all had this singular dimorphic condition, the 

 second pair in all cases having this peculiar narrow form. 



It was worthy of remark that in plants with alternate leaves, the 

 leaves with their axial buds were generally about the same size. 

 Li some few instances there were variations in the size, especially 

 in the one-third arrangement of the leaves on the stem. In oppo- 

 site leaved plants the rule w- as the other way ; one bud or one leaf, 

 either in the blade or petiole, being larger or longer than the other. 

 In the maples this was especially the case. At times the petioles 

 in some cases would be not more than half the length opposite. He 

 had found this especial peculiarit}^, however, in no other species 

 but A. Pennsylvanicum that he had been able to examine, which 

 included most in common cultivation. It might be in A. spicatum^ 

 Lam., which he had not been able to examine this season, and 

 which he supposed to be but a variety of A. Permsylvaiiicum.

On Pectinatella magnifica. — Prof. Leidy exhibited a living 

 specimen of the fresli-water ciliated poljp, formerly described by 

 him under the name of Pectinatella magnifica. It was obtained 

 by him this morning from the mill-pond at Kirkwood, X. J., ou 

 the Camden and Atlantic R. R. The specimen, about four inches 

 square and three inches thick, is a fragment of a large colony, 

 which enveloped the submerged trunk of a tree. The entire 

 colon^'^ was estimated to be about six feet long, and from six to 

 twelve inches in diameter, including that of the tree trunk, which 

 ■was about four inches. Several branches of the tree were also 

 invested with extensions of the colony from six inches to a foot 

 in length. Pectinatella is by far the lai'gest of all the known 

 fresh-water ciliated polj'ps, and, indeed, is not surpassed by any 

 of the marine forms known to us. It has not been determined 

 ■whether the huge Pectinatella colonies start each from a single 

 individual, or are the result of the confluence of a number of 

 small colonies. On the approach of winter the colonies die and 

 undergo decomposition, in which process the remarkable winter 

 eggs or statoblasts are liberated. These are provided with 

 anchor-like spines, by which, as in the case of the eggs of skates 

 and sharks, they become attached to various fixed bodies. 



On a Parasitic Worm of the House-fly. — Prof. Leidy remarked 

 that since it had become well known that mau}^ parasitic worms 

 passed different stages of development within several different 

 animals, he had from time to time sought for the sources from 

 whence the more common thread worms obtained entrance into 

 the human bod}'', but thus far without success. The Trichina 

 spiralis, discovered in man in 1833 by Mr. Hilton, and described 

 and named by Prof. Owen in 1835, was first found in the hog by 

 Prof. Leidy in 1846 (See Proc. A. N. S., iii. 108), but it was not 

 until some years subsequent!}^ that it was determined that man 

 and the hog acted reciprocally as hosts for the Trichina in its 

 different stages of development. 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



In examining various common animals of our household, Prof. 

 Leidy had found a thread worm, infesting the common house-fly. 

 The worm is from a line to the tenth of an inch long, and lives in 

 the proboscis of the fly. It was found in numbers from one to 

 three in about one fly in five. The parasite was first discovered 

 in the house-fiy of India, by the English naturalist, Mr. H. J. 

 Carter, who described it under the name of Filaria Ahiscse, and 

 suggested the opinion that it might be the source of the Guinea 

 worm, Filaria 3Iedinensis in man. Mr. Carter states that he 

 found from two to twenty of the worms in one fly of three. Di'. 

 Diesing referred the parasite to a new gepus with the name of 

 Hahronema Muscse. The singular position in which the worm 

 lives suggests the many unsuspected places we have to search to 

 find the parents or offspring of our own parasites. 



Notice of some Fresh Water Infusoria. — Prof. Leidy remarked 

 that a species of Limnias, belonging to the order of wheel animal- 

 cules, or Rotatoria, was exceedingly abundant in our rivers. It 

 lives in a tube, of its own construction, attached to aquatic plants 

 and stones. He had not been able to determine whether it was a 

 diflferent species from the L. ceratophylli of Europe. The latter 

 is described as solitary, but the common Limnias of our rivers is 

 remarkable for the dense bunches that it forms. In many locali- 

 ties of the Schu^dkill almost every stone exhibits multitudes of 

 such bunches, pendent from the sides and under part. The 

 bunches are conical, and usually one tube serves as a pedicle, 

 while the others hang from it and often curve outwardly. From 

 two or three to as many as fifty tubes may be counted in a bunch. 

 This fasciculated character may distinguish the animalcule as a 

 variety, which might be named L. socialis. 



The bunches of Limnias form a support for a multitude of 

 other animalcules. Among the latter, Cothumiia pusilla \^ qniiQ 

 common. Prof. Leidy had also observed upon the bunches on 

 several occasions the curious branching infusorium described b}'' 

 Ehrenberg, and also described and figured by Claparede under 

 the name of Dendrosoma radians. This measures a half a line 

 or more in length, and terminates in branchlets, each with a 

 rounded end, from which project a multitude of delicate rays, 

 extendino- as much as the one-twelfth of a line in length.

Dr. Nolan, having announced the death of Dr. John Hamilton 

 Slack, made the following remarks :— 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



Dr. Slack was born September 23d, 1834. After graduating 

 from the Department of Arts of the Universitj' of Pennsylvania, 

 he made a tour of Europe, Northern Africa, and the Nile, and was 

 elected a member of the Academy in July, 185*7. During the same 

 year he presented valuable specimens of Egj'ptian natural history 

 and antiquities, for which the thanks of the Academy were formally 

 returned. The next year he presented for publication a paper, 

 which appeared in the Proceedings under the title " Catalogue 

 and Notes on the Egyptian Antiquities in the Museum of the 

 Academy." In the spring of 1859 he graduated from the Medical 

 Department of the University, and at once applied himself to the 

 practice of his profession and the study of natural histor3^ From 

 this time until his removal from the city he was an active and 

 enthusiastic worker in the Academy. His name appears in the 

 Proceedings as a constant contributor to the museum and library, 

 and also as the author of threa papers on Mammalogy, the most 

 important of which was a monograph of the Prehensile-tailed 

 Quadrumana of South America. The work, however, by which 

 he Avill be longest remembered as a member of the Society is his 

 Handbook to the Museum, the first edition of which appeared in 

 1861 and was rapidly exhausted. A second edition was imme- 

 diately issued, and of this, also, several thousand copies were sold, 

 showing that the Handbook supplied a want long felt, and Avhich, 

 in consequence of the partial rearrangement of the collections, 

 again exists. 



Dr. Slack was elected Librarian of the College of Physicians 

 in December, 1864, and served until December 31, 1867. He 

 removed from the city in 1868 to his estate in Warren County, 

 New Jersey, which he named Troutdale, and where he resided 

 until his death, on August 24, 1874, actively engaged in pisci- 

 culture. So highly was his work in this field appreciated that he 

 was appointed one of the Fish Commissioners of New Jersey. He 

 also rendered important service as Assistant United States Fish 

 Commissioner under Prof. Baird, during the winter of 1873-74, in 

 hatching nearly half a million eggs of the Salmo quinnat received 

 from California, and in distributing the fry to various rivers of the 

 Middle and Southern States. His contributions to the literature 

 of practical fish culture during this time were numerous and valu- 

 able. 



Dr. Slack was a gentleman of unusuallv varied attainments. 

 Although he was most devoted to the natural sciences, he exhibited 

 an active interest in literature and art. He possessed talents as 

 a musical composer which, if cultivated, would have secured him 

 a wide-spread reputation. As it is, his arrangement of Home, Sweet 

 Home has rendered his name familiar to thousands who know 

 nothing about his life-work. He extended hearty sympathy and 

 valuable assistance to those who took an interest in the pursuits 

 to which he was devoted ; and these, as well as more advanced

students of natural histoiy, who recognized in him a valued asso- 

 ciate, will hear of his death with unfeigned sorrow.

Notice of a Remarkahh Amceba. — Prof. Leidy stated that in 

 the early part of last June, in examining some material obtained 

 from a mill-pond at Absecom, New Jersey, he had observed a most 

 wonderful amoeboid animal, of which he had made notes, but was 

 not able at the time to make a drawing and satisfactory^ descrip- 

 tion. Subsequently he sought patiently' for two daj^s in the same 

 material for another individual, but without success. Last week he 

 made a visit to the Absecom mill-pond to seek the curious 

 amoeboid, and was so fortunate as to find it again. Prof. Leidy 

 exhibited a drawing of the animal, and described it as follows : — 



The animal at rest is spherical or oval, or constricted back of the 

 middle. Li the spherical form it measured the one-fifth of a milli- 

 metre in diameter ; in the oval and constricted form it was about 

 one-fourth of a millimetre long, and one-sixth of a millimetre broad. 

 It is white or cream colored, opaque, or translucent at the border, 

 and was spotted green from food balls of desmids. It moves with 

 extreme sluggishness, and with little change of form. From the 

 fore part of the body the animal was observed to project almost 

 simultaneousl}'^ a number of long, conical, acute pseudopods, about 

 the one-twelfth of a millimetre long. From the back part in the 

 same manner a multitude of papillaform pseudopods were projected 

 about the one-fiftieth of a millimetre long. All the pseudopods and 

 the surface of the body everywhere bristled with innumerable 

 minute spicules. From time to time more or less obtuse portions 

 of the clear ectosarc were projected, and these likewise were 

 observed to be covered with the minute spicules. The opacity 

 of the animal prevented the exhibition of a nucleus, if such exists. 



In general appearance the curious creature resembles one of the 

 forms of Pelomyxajyalustris, described by Prof. Greef, in Schultze's 

 Archiv, vol. x. pi. iv., fig. 9, but in this, minute spicules project only 

 from the posterior disk-like extremity of the body, as they have 

 also been observed to do in the corresponding part of Amoeba 

 villosa, of Wallich, and perhaps other species. 



The general spiculate character of the Absecom amoeboid is 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 143 



probably sufficient to distinguish tlie animal generically from 

 Amffiba, and in this A'iew the animal may be named Deinamoeha 

 mirabilis. 



On the Mode in lohich Amoeba swallows its Food. — Prof. Leidy 

 remarked that he had supposed that Amoeba swallows food by 

 this becoming adherent to the body, and then enveloped much 

 as insects become caught and involved in syrup or other viscid 

 substances. He had repeatedly observed a large Amoeba, which 

 he supposes to be A. prince20S., creep into the interstices of a 

 mass of mud and appear on the other side without a particle ad- 

 herent. On one occasion he had accidentall}'' noticed an Amoeba, 

 with an active flagellate infusorium, a Urocentrum, included be- 

 tween two of its finger-like pseudopods. It so happened that the 

 ends of these were in contact with a confervous filament, and 

 the glasses above and below, between which the Amoeba was ex- 

 amined, effectuall}^ prevented the Urocentrum from escaping. The 

 condition of imprisonment of the latter was so peculiar that he 

 was led to watch it. The ends of the two pseudopods of the 

 Amoeba gradually approached, came into contact, and then actually 

 became fused, a thing which he had never before observed with 

 the pseudopods of an Amoeba. The Urocentrum continued to move 

 actively back and forth, endeavoring to escape. At the next moment 

 a delicate film of the ectosarc proceeded from the body of the 

 Amoeba, above and below, and gradually extended outwardly so 

 as to convert the circle of the pseudopods into a complete sac, 

 inclosing the Urocentrum. Another of these creatures was noticed 

 within the Amoeba which appeared to have been inclosed in the 

 same manner. 



This observation would make it appear that the food of the 

 Amoeba ordinarily does not simply adhere to the bod}^, and then 

 sink into its substance, but rather, after becoming adherent or 

 covered by the pseudopods or bod}-, is then inclosed by the active 

 extension of a film of ectosarc around it. 



The death of Dr. Jeffreys Wyman was announced.

On the Motive Poiver of Diatomes. — Prof. Leidy made some re- 

 marks on the moving power of diatomes, desmids, and other algae. 

 While the cause of motion remains unknown, some of the uses are 

 obvious. The power is considerable, and enables these minute 

 organisms when mingled with mud readily to extricate themselves 




144 TROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



and rise to the surface, wliere the}' may receive the influence of 

 light and air. In examining tlie surface-mud of a shallow rain- 

 water pool, in a recent excavation in brick cla}", he found little 

 else but an abundance of minute diatomes. He was not sufficiently 

 familiar with the diatomes to name the species, but it resembled 

 Navicula 7'adiosa. The little diatomes were very active, gliding 

 hither and thither, and knocking the quartz sand grains about. 

 Noticing the latter, he made some comparative measurements, and 

 found that the NaviculfB wonld move grains of sand as much as 

 twenty-five times their OAvn superficial area, and probably fifty 

 times their own bulk and weight, or perhaps more. 



Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt made the following remarks : — 



While examining, this summer, into the structure of some of the 

 so-called insectivorous plants, but more especially into the ana- 

 tomy of the genus Nepenthes^ I observed a part which I have not 

 seen expressed before, and of suflScient interest, perhaps, to go 

 upon record. 



In the vegetable kingdom it is exceedingly rare to meet with 

 glands which liave distinct excretory ducts. Some authors deny 

 their existence entirely; but in N'epenthes rafflesiana^ N. distilla- 

 toria, and N. j^^iylif^^i^phora, and probably in all the species, are 

 large cylindrical glands which pour out their secretion through 

 distinct excretory dticts. In N. didillatoria these glands ai'e, on 

 an average, about the one-thirty-fifth of an inch long, and the 

 one-twentieth of an inch wide, while the ducts measure about the 

 one-thirtieth of an inch in length. In the Raffleaiana the glands 

 and ducts are much larger. A dense tissue of cells surrounds and 

 thoroughl3^ imbeds these glands in Nepenthes^ and this peculiarity 

 of position renders excretory ducts necessary' for the secretion to 

 find its way into the pitchers. 



In tlie vegetable kingdom it is the rule for glands to be located 

 on surfaces, but in Nepenthes where one s^-stem of glands is im- 

 bedded the duct becomes necessary, and so far as I know is the 

 onl}^ instance of such ducts among plants.

Remarks on Sponges — Prof. Leidy x'emarked that the animal 

 nature and structure of the sponges were first clearly made known 

 b^' Mr. H. J. Carter, of England, and Prof. H. James Clark, of 

 this country. The sponges are compound, flagellate infusoria. 

 The sponge infusorium had been appropriately named by Mr. 

 Carter the spongozoou, the exact characters of which were first 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA, 145 



noted by Prof. Clark, and confirmed Iw Mr Carter. The spongo- 

 zoon is a globular cell, surmounted by a delicate cup, from tLie 

 bottom of which projects a flagellum. The little animals are situ- . 

 ated on the interior of hollow spheres of the sponges sustained 

 b}^ the skeleton of the compressed animal, whether this be corne- 

 ous, as in the common sponge, or wliether it be siliceous or calca- 

 .reous. The observations of Prof. Clark had been made on a fresh 

 water sponge, to which he had given the name of SpongiUa arach- 

 noidea. Mr. Carter's observations had been made on both fresh- 

 water sponges and the different classes of marine sponges. Prof. 

 Leidy at first supposed that the sponge described by Prof. Clark 

 might be the one he had formerly noticed under the name of Spon- 

 giUa fragile (Proc. A. N. S. 1851, 278), but comparison proved 

 them to be diflerent. They are both of the same color, but the 

 siliceous spicules of S. arachnoidea are stated to be tuberculate, 

 while they are smooth in S.fragilii^. Dr. Leidy had examined the 

 spongozoon of the latter, and found that it presented the same 

 essential structure as described by Prof. Clark and Mr. Carter in 

 other sponges. 



Prof. Leidy further remarked that he had found several speci- 

 mens of the curious rhizopod, discovered by Cienkowski, and 

 named by him Glathrulina elegans. Thej^were found among L^tri- 

 cularia, but though retaining their stems were unattached and 

 apparently dead. One of the specimens presented a peculiar and 

 as yet unexplained character. On one side of the laticed head 

 the orifices were capped with little inverted, hemispherical cups, 

 from the top of which projected a funnel like the cup of the spon- 

 gozoa. Prof. Leidy was pursuing his search for the living and 

 attached Clathrulina. 



Prof. Leeds made some remarks concerning a remarkable mine- 

 ral found in a bank of white sand near Fayetteville, N. C. It was, 

 in appearance, a rod of glass, four feet in length and two inches 

 in diameter, which was made up of a great number of irregular 

 fragments. These fragments were highly polished on one side — 

 the side apparently turned toward the hollow axis of the rod, and 

 excessivel^'^ contorted on the exterior side. They consisted almost 

 entirely of silex, the remainder being chieflj' oxide of iron. Ac- 

 curate analj'sis showed that the percentages of the constituents 

 in these siliceous fragments and in the sand found in the hollow 

 core of the rod were the same. On account of this identity in 

 composition, and the incompetency of any other known agent to 

 produce such a fusion of almost pure silex, it was concluded that 

 this "rod of glass" was a result of lightniug — a lightning-lube or 

 fulgurite, as such products have been called. 



Prof. Leeds also gave the particulars concerning a great eleva- 

 tion of temperature which had occurred in the adit level of a lead 

 mine in Missouri, where the heat had suddenly risen from 60° to 




146 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



over 100°, and had compelled the workmen, for the time being, to 

 suspend work. The earth was found to contain over 75 per cent, 

 of sulphate of protoxide of iron, and the heating had been due to 

 the rapid absorption of ox^'gen b^- sulphuret of iron, disseminated 

 throughout the earth in a finely divided condition. 



Change of Habit through Fungoid Agency. — Mr. Thomas Mee- 

 HAN referred to a former communication in which he exhibited 

 specimens of Euphorbia cordata, or U. humistrata, collected by 

 him in the Rock}'^ Mountains, and which, norqaally procumbent, 

 had assumed an erect habit on being attacked by a fungulus ^'Bci- 

 dium EuphorbifE hypericifolia^. 



He now found that the common trailing Euphorbia of our sec- 

 tion, E. maculata, when attacked by the same fungulus, assumed 

 the same erect habit. There was an additional interest in this 

 observation, from the fact that with change of habit of growth 

 there was a whole change in specific character in the direction of 

 E. hypericifolia. In a comparison of the leading characters of 

 the two species, we see that in E. maculata there is a profusely 

 hairy stem, while that of E.hiipericifolia is nearly smooth. The 

 same is true of the fruit. The leaves of the former species are 

 very oblique at the base — the latter nearly regular. The flowers 

 are produced in all the axils. In the E. hypericifolia the stems 

 have a tendency to be nodose at the joints, while E. maculata is 

 nearly free from this character, and the flowers are mainly in 

 heads at the ends of the branches. The E. maculata, after the 

 fungoid attack becoming erect, also becomes nodose, and has the 

 flowers on the ends of the comparatively smooth branchlets, while 

 the leaves have lost their pointed obliquity ; and, in short, all the 

 characters make an intermediate between the two species. 



He said it would not be fair to assume, from these facts, that 

 Euphorbia hyjjericifolia was an evolution from E. maculata, but, 

 as there could be no doubt that nutrition was one of the fac- 

 tors in the government of form, we could saj- that certain phases 

 of nutrition, brought about by an attack of a minute fungus, 

 would change the characters to the direction of those in that 

 species.

NOTES ON THE SANTA FE MAELS, AND SOME OF THE CONTAINED 

 VERTEBRATE FOSSILS. 



BY E. D. COPE. 



The palffiontological and geological examination, conducted by 

 the part}' of the U. S. Survey, west of the north meridian, Lieut. 

 G. M. Wheeler in charge, has already, during the present season, 

 developed facts of interest, some of which are noticed below. 

 The exploration has extended to the extensive lacustrine deposit 

 in the valley of the Rio Grande, which has been termed by Dr. 

 Haj'den the Santa Fe marls. This author describes the deposits 

 as first appearing in the north near Taos, and continuing for an 

 unknown distance southward, and occupying the valley between 

 the Rocky Mountains on the east, and the' Jemez range on the 

 west, he regards it as late Tertiary, but without special determi- 

 nation or co-ordination with the other known lacustrine forma- 

 tions of this continent. 



Abundant material having been obtained by the party, it is 

 easy to determine the fauna, whose remains are entombed in it, to 

 be a part of that already described b}^ Dr. Leid}- and the writer, 

 as occurring in Dakota and Colorado, under the name of Pliocene. 

 This conclusion is indicated bj' the presence of the genera Hippo- 

 therium, Protohij^pus, Procamelus, Cosoryx, 3Ie7'ychyus, and 

 known Pliocene species of other genera, among which may be 

 mentioned Canis^ Acei^atheriuvi, etc. In addition to species 

 alread}- known, a number new to science were obtained, of some 

 of which descriptions are appended. 



Martes nambianus, sp. nov. 



Represented by a mandibular ramus which supports three teeth. 

 The anterior blade of the sectorial is rather obtuse. The first 

 premolar is one rooted ; the second and third are without pos- 

 terior coronal lobe, but exhibit small basal lobes, both anterior 

 and posterior. The anterior of the second is rather elevated, and 

 the entire crown is directed obliquely forwards. Canine com- 

 pressed. Mental foramina below the second and third premolars.

This species is of smaller size than the 31. miisfelinus, Cope,^ 

 and the sectorial tooth less elevated and trenchant. 



Cosoryx ramosus, sp. nov. 



C7iar. Gen. — Inferior molars prismatic, 3-3 ; the premolars all sectorial, 

 last -R-ith short branch crests. Molars with basal intercolumuar tuber- 

 cles. Horns superciliarj', solid, branched. 



This genus was indicated by Dr. Leidy from a horn of the spe- 

 cies known to him, the Cosoryx furcatus^ from the Pliocene beds 

 of the Niobrara. The same, or a similar species, has left abun- 

 dant remains in the Santa Fe marls, and, in connection with the 

 more numerous G. ramosus, has enabled me to determine the 

 dental and other characters of the genus. 



After a careful examination of the horns of these species in my 

 possession, those of eighteen individuals (at least I find that of 

 ten where the basal portion is preserved), the beam has been 

 broken off and reunited by anchylosis in six. In most of these 

 the spot is marked by a ring of exostosed tuberosities, like those 

 constituting the burr of the deer's horn. The fracture has taken 

 place in every instance at a point as far above the frontal bone as 

 the burr of deer is situated, and is irregular in outline, higher on 

 one side than the other. In some of the specimens the smaller 

 antlers are also broken, and exhibit a similar burr, but the terminal 

 portion is usuall}' lost. In one specimen, a broken antler is an- 

 ch3iosed in the usual manner of overlapping ends. 



The horns are solid, the centre having a narrow spongy axis. 

 The surface is dense, and marked by arterial grooves, but not 

 pierced b}^ noticeable foramina. 



It is evidentl}' a question whether this genus should be referred 

 to the hollow or solid horned Rurainantia, to the Bovidse or Ce?^- 

 vidse. The horns miglit be regarded as those of deer, were it not 

 for the occasional specimens without burr, while the teeth are both 

 cervine and bovine. We ma}' here draw such inferences as we can 

 respecting the nature of the covering of the horn. That the frac- 

 tured beam should not be lost, indicates the presence of some kind 

 of covering to retain it. That this covering was not hornj-, is 

 probable from the fact that the horns are branched, a structure 

 impossible to the Bovidse., since antlers effectually prevent the 

 usual mode of increase of horn by additions at the base and 

 removal at the extremit}-. That such covering protected arteries, 



' Hayden's Annual Report, 1874. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 149 



■which aided in the production of the burrs, is also probable. We 

 may thus believe it to have been dermal like that of the giraffe or 

 the Antilocapra at the period of immaturit}' of its horny sheath. 



It may be concluded then that the genus Cosoryx represents 

 the ancestral type of the Germdae^ and explains the origin of the 

 remarkable t3'pe of horns of that family as follows : Ruminants 

 with fixed horns of structure more dense and brittle than others 

 of the same tj^pe, in their annual combats at the rutting season, 

 very frequently broke the beams off not far above the base. The 

 usual location of nutrition followed, which being annually re- 

 peated, became as periodical in its return as the activity of nutri- 

 tion of the reproductive system. This activity ceasing, the horn 

 being dense lost its vitalit3', the more so as the normal covering 

 would have already perished in its distal portions. The natural 

 consequence, tha separation of the dead from the living bone by 

 suppuration, would follow. This process would, however, probably 

 require a longer time for the establishment of its periodical return 

 than the fracture and attachment of the existing horn. 



This appears to be the only explanation of the origin of the 

 phenomena exhibited by the horns of the Cervidse, and is sug- 

 gested by the specimens of Cosoryx to be described. 



Char. Specif. — This species is larger than the Cfurcalus^i Leidy, 

 and exhibits two antlers instead of one, of which the first is given 

 off at a point much further from the base than in that species. 



The beam near the base is curved a little inwards, and is semi- 

 circular in section, the outer face being slightly concave, the inner 

 very convex. The base is situated a short distance within the 

 free superciliary border. The beam becomes more cylindric, and 

 then expanding in a fore and aft direction, gives off an antler at 

 right angles, nearly parallel to the cranial axis. At a distance 

 little over half the elevation of the first antler, the beam gives off 

 a second, in a plane transverse to the axis of the skull. The 

 terminal portion of the beam is cylindric, curved, and acute at 

 the apex. 



]Mandibles with teeth of two species of this genus were found, 

 the smaller of which, occurring wuth the other portions of C.fur- 

 catus, belong to it. The larger differs in the elevation of the 

 intercrescentic column of the first molar, which is worn into a 

 loop at ordinary maturity ; this may however be but an individual 

 variation. The diastema is long, and the ramus of that point 

 quite slender.

Cosoryx teres, sp. nov. 



Established on the connected frontal bones supporting the 

 horns of one specimen, and represented by portions of horns of 

 two others. The former individual is larger than any one belong- 

 ing to the other species, and the species is doubtless the largest 

 of the genus. The horns stand above the posterior part of the 

 orbit, which excavates its base, and presenting a considerable face 

 descending into the temporal or zj'gomatic fossa. There is no 

 free superciliar}- rim outside of the base as in G. ramosus, Cope. 

 The section of the beam near the base is a regular oval, the long 

 axis directed longitudinally and a little outward in front. The 

 beam is erect with a slight curvature outwards at the inner base 

 only. So far as preserved it does not branch, but may do so in 

 its distal portion which is lost. The tissue is more spongy in- 

 teriorly than in the other species ; supra-orbital foramen far within 

 the superciliary border.

Hesperomys loxodon, sp. nov. 



An entire mandibular ramus with all the teeth preserved, was 

 found in the same deposits as the preceding species. Molars sub- 

 equal, short-crowned, triturating surface sigmoid. The apices of 

 the sigma on the inner side, tubercular, and anterior to the outer 

 apices. First molar with an additional transverse crest in front. 

 Incisor compressed, outer angle of enamel face rounded, smooth.

Panolax sanctaefidei, gen. et sp. nov. 



Char. Gen. Molars prismatic, transverse, except the first and 

 last, each divided by a plate of enamel extending transversely from 

 the inner side. Anterior molar longitudinal ; posterior molar 

 composed of two columns. 



This genus is represented by numerous teeth and portions of the 

 cranium. It evidently belonged to the Leporidae, and is allied to 

 both Lepus and Palseolagus. As the teeth are mostly separate, it 

 is not eas}' to determine which is the posterior and which the ante- 

 rior molar. Judging by the analogy of the known species, the 

 determination as here made is correct ; should the relations be 

 reversed the species will be referred to Palseolagus. 



Char. Specif. The teeth are curved, the convexity inwards. 

 Inner face grooved, the groove occupied by cementum ; the outer 

 border compressed either without or with very shallow groove. 

 First molar with triturating surface twice as long as wide with 

 an entering loop of enamel on the inner side, anteriorly narrower. 

 Last molar as wide antero-posteriorly as transversel}^, the shaft 

 curved backwards ; the posterior column sub-cylindric half the 

 diameter of the anterior. 



This species is about the size of the northern hare. 

 Cathartes umbrosus, sp. nov. 



Represented by numerous portions of nearly all parts of the 

 skeleton, in excellent preservation. The beak from the frontal 

 bone to near the apex is preserved ; it displa3's the depression just 

 anterior to the uares, which marks the anterior boundary of the 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



ceve. The culmen is nearly liorizontal to just beyond this mark, 

 and then exhibits a gradual decurvature to the apex. The beak 

 is strongly compressed, and the tomia strongly decurved, forming 

 an open festoon, whose middle point marks one-fourth the length 

 of the beak from the nares. The latter are directed obliquel}' down- 

 wards and forwards, narrowing anteriorly, and having a prominent 

 inferior bounding ledge. The mandible is weak, the symphysis 

 marking on half the length of the beak, from the anterior angle of 

 the nares. 



The bones of the anterior extremities exhibit large and power- 

 ful proportions as compared with the posterior, appropriatelj' to 

 capacity for sustained flight. The head of the humerus is much 

 compressed, and the articular face is nearly divided into two by 

 the deep bicipital groove. The head of the femur is small, and 

 the rotular face, a wide and deep groove. The tibia is slender, 

 the shaft much compressed, with a prominent ridge. The cuemial 

 crest is short, and not produced downwards on the shaft. The 

 distal posterior bridge is narrow and oblique. The tarso-metatar- 

 sus has a strong exterior crest which constitutes half the width of 



the shaft.

Wheat and C/it'.s.s. — Mr. Thomas Meehan introcUiccd a snbject 

 which he said liad never before, to his linovvledge, been brought 

 directly to the attention of a scientific bodj^ — the [)opular belief 

 that wheat will turn to cliess. The scientific world might well be 

 pardoned for deriding such an idea, for if so distinct a genus as 

 Triticum can be found to produce a Bromus, the most exaggerated 

 notion of the "leaping" power of nature must be enlarged in con- 

 sidering theories of evolution. Yet he might say he had seen 

 many popular impressions, derided b}' men of science, prove true. 

 When a boy his agricultural friends insisted that the same toad 

 which would deposit its eggs in water when convenient, would 

 bring forth its young alive when deprived of the water privilege. 

 He iiad proved the fact by keeping toads in breeding condition in 

 confinement, and counting the toadlets when certainly not more 

 than a few days old. The idea was once derided by intelligent 

 men, but he believed most zoologists now admit that the common 

 toad is oviparous or viviparous according to circumstances. In 

 like manner in his youth he saw five young snakes, one after 

 another, enter the mouth of the parent when alarmed. This was 

 a universal belief of country people ; yet only last ,year, on over- 

 whelming evidence before the American Association, was it 

 admitted as scientific truth. Again, during the past year we had 

 seen how a popular belief in regard to an apparent elongation of 

 tree trunks had proved to be true, though the popular reasoning 

 was wrong. We now know that trees may sometimes be lifted 

 from year to 3'ear bv the gradual thickening of roots growing 

 over a rocky base, so that a side branch, which in a young tree 

 is opposite to a mark, ma}-, in time, be as much as a foot above 

 it, as popular observation contends it sometimes will. With these 

 things in mind he had held himself open to give even some trouble 

 to get reimted facts with reference to this question of ciiess. He 

 now exhibited one of several specimens sent him by Mr. Levette 

 of the Indiana Geological Survey, and proceeded to point out 

 that there could be no mistake about the branch from the wheat 

 ear being Brumus secalinus, the common chess, so far as the palea 

 and glumes were concerned. In the flowers he had dissected he 

 found no perfect grain to compare with wheat. In instances pre- 

 viously recorded there seems never to have been any dispute about 

 the appearance from tlie wheat head being the real Bromus. But 

 it had l)cen contended that in these cases an examination had 

 11 




154 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



shown an accidental union of two culms, one from each plant, and 

 which, in some yvay, had formed an api)arent union one with 

 another. This appeared not to be the case in the present speci- 

 men. In the wheat ear the small clusters of flowers inclosing the 

 ultimate grain, came out at each bend of tlie zigzag rachis. The 

 spike of chess appeared to come out at one of these Ijcnds, the 

 lowermost, taking, in fact, the place of one of these small clusters. 

 It was not an accidental union of two distinct parts, but appa- 

 rently a substitution of one part for another. Again the Bromus 

 secalinus rarel}' gets as tall as wheat, especially so tall as this 

 strong looking wheat head had evidentl3^ grown. There was, he 

 said, another remarkable fact connected with the popidar reports. 

 Many other grasses grow with wheat as well as Ih'omus fiecalinus, 

 the common chess or cheat. It was apparenth' as easy for any 

 of these to become accidentally conjoined with wheat as this, but 

 no case is brought forward. There was enough in appearance, he 

 thought, that deserved further investigation. 



On Mr. Median's motion, the specimen was referred to the 

 Biological and Microscopical Section for examination. 



Neio Groivth of Plants. — Mr. John H. Redfield called the 

 attention of the Academy to some curious facts recently observed 

 b^^ Mr. C. F. Parker. On some low marshy ground near the Dela- 

 ware River below this city, was deposited in the spring a large 

 amount of mud dredged from the channel of the river. The mud 

 was spread to the depth of several feet over a space of more than 

 an acre in extent, for the purpose of raising the level. Later in 

 the season over this whole area sprung up a growth composed 

 almost exclusivol}^ of two plants, viz., Polygonum orienlale, an 

 East Indian species (which occasional!}- occurs on waste ground), 

 and Clcome pnngenff^n. West India species of less fi-equent occur- 

 rence. Tlie former plant constituted the mass of the growth, 

 though there may have been more than one hundred plants of the 

 Cleome scattered among the growth. One or two specimens of 

 Quamoclit coccinea, also a naturalized species, were likewise 

 noticed. Mr. Parker had also previously observed a similar case 

 upon Smith's Island, and also in two localities in Camden, where 

 channel mud had been thus deposited. Mr. Redfield thought it 

 an interesting inquiry as to whence the seeds of these plants origi- 

 nated, and how they had survived their long burial in the river 

 mud. 



Dr. Leidj' thought that as the vicinity had long been used as a 

 place for the deposit of ballast from ships, the seeds might have 

 laid upon the ground previously, and have been quickened by the 

 deposit of the mud. 



Mr. Meehan referred to some recent discoveries as to the effect 

 of oxygen in the germination of seeds, and thought that perhaps 

 tlie seeds of these plants, protected from air while buried under 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 155 



water, might, under exposure to the air, germinate. He referred 

 to other cases of the springing up of new plants after the deposit 

 of fresh earth, and suggested a mode of testing tlie origin of the 

 seeds. 



Dr. Carson and Mr. Auhre}^ H. Smith called attention to the 

 great change which, during late 3'ears, had occurred in the vege- 

 tation of the neck below the city. 



On Asplenium ebenoides. — Mr. Redfield then alluded to the fern 

 known as Asplenium ebenoides^ described some years ago b}"^ Mr. 

 Scott, from a ^qw plants found on the rock}' banks of the Schuyl- 

 kill above Philadelphia. Most of our botanists have doubted the 

 validity of the species, and have supposed it to be an abnormal or 

 hybrid form originating from Campfosorus rhizophyllus (Walking 

 Fern), and Asplenium eheneum^ both of which species occur abund- 

 antly- at the locality. Recently a few plants of the same form 

 have been found near Havana, Alabama, b}' Miss Tutwiler, and 

 in precisely the same suspicious compau}-. Her account ma^^ be 

 found in the Bulletin of the Torre^' Club for Ma}-, 1873. Recently 

 Mr. A. H. Curtiss, of Libert}', Ya., has received from Alabama a 

 frond of this fern, rooting at the apex, precisely as the walking 

 fern does. Mr. Redfield thought this fact tended to confirm the 

 doubts already entertained upon the validity of the species. 



Notice of some Bhizopods. — Prof. Leidy remarked that since 

 he had made a communication on Deinaniceba mirabilis he had 

 had the opportunity- of examining a number of additional speci- 

 mens. All of them appeared to be variegated with twin spots of 

 green, which he found to be due to the scattered joints of two spe- 

 cies of desmids of the genus Did3-moprium, sw-allowed as food. He 

 had observed the animal swallow a considerable portion of a ^\i\.- 

 mcnt o^ Didymoprium GretnJUi, In another instance he had seen 

 an individual eject upwards of fi[ ft}' joints o^ Didi/mopfium Bre- 

 bissonii, from three different portions of the body simultaneously. 

 Another peculiarity he liad observed in the animal which had pre- 

 viously escaped his notice. The body appears to be surrounded 

 or enclosed in what might be called an atmosphere of minute spi- 

 cules, which can be seen as a circle a short distance beyond the 

 outline of the body. 



Prof. Leidy then presented drawings and descriptions of a 

 number of Difflugians which he supposed to be new. They were 

 mostly found in a pond in Al)secom Creek, New Jersey, and in 

 the sphagnum on the border of the pond. Most of the same spe- 

 cies were likewise found in a sphagnous swamp of Lougacoming, 

 and in the sphagnum on the border of Lake Hattacawanna, New 

 Jersey. 



DiFFLUGTA VAS. Test composed of angular quartz particles, 

 generally coarse, shape pyriform, with the neck constricted where 

 it joins the body; fundus obtuse; mouth large, circular. Ento- 




156 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMT OF 



sarc bright green from the abundance of chlorophyl granules. 

 Length of test | mm.; neck one-fourth to one-third the length of 

 the test. Abundant in Absecom Pond, New Jersey. 



DiFFLUGiA OLLA. Test composed usually of angular quartz par-

Valuations in Solanum Fendleri^ A. G. — Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 said that among otlier agricultural and horticultural plants the 

 history of the potato was not clearly known. It was said to be a 

 native of Mexico, Chili, and Peru, but he doubted whether it had 

 been found anywhere beyond all question indigenous. Solanum 

 Fendleri, A. Gray, had much in common with S. tuheroimm. The 

 flowers and foliage diflered chiefly in being much smaller in all 

 their parts. He had plants under culture for eight years, but 

 could not find any variation in the shape and size of the tubers 

 until this year, when they have begun to vary in the direction of 

 the common potato. Hitherto, the tubers have been round, about 

 the size of a large bullet, and rugose from the imperfect tuber 

 cells on the surface. Tliis season the roots have varied in the 

 direction of the common potato. They are oval and compressed, 

 and one has reached a dimension of one inch wide and two inches 

 long, and with the skin clear and semi-translucent as we see in 

 more delicate potatoes. He thinks, however, that these facts do 

 no more than suggest a possibility of the unity of origin of the 

 Solanum Fendleri and Solanum tuberosum. The fact, that the 

 former tubers will endure a temperature of zero in the ground, 

 while the latter was so easily destroyed by frost, might, indeed, 

 be considered against such possibility unless we could conceive 

 of some physical change coexistent with a change of form. 



Ginjstallization in Plants. — Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt remarked that 

 the subject of crystallization in plants, though not new to botan- 

 ists, is interesting because of the extreme beauty of these deposits, 

 and, also, an account of the obscurity of their origin and true 

 significance in the life-histor}^ of the plants. Tiie entomologist, 

 perhaps, has need for alarm, because some botanists assert that 

 some i)lants devour the special objects of his study ; but, I think, 

 the mineralogist might feel equally jealous to learn that the all- 

 devouring plants were busy picking up his crystals from the 

 inorganic kingdom, and using them, at least, to beautify their 

 own tissues. 



I would ask attention, at this time, to only one form of plant- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



150 



crystal — the cystolith — so called because the aggregation of crys- 

 tals is inclosed in a capsule or C3'st within a special cell, and is, 

 moreover, connected with its cell by means of a delicate filament, 

 difl'ering in this particular from all other cell-contents. 



In our common nettle (Urtica) we meet with the ordinary form 

 of cystolith. A simjjle aggregation of minute crystals — proliably 

 oxalate of lime — nearly' circular in form, showing the capsule 

 plainly which envelops them, and also the special cell containing 

 the c3'stolith. About six hundred fill a line an inch long, and 

 four hundred are found in one square inch. Each cystolith con- 

 tains about one hundred individual crystals. At lowest estimate, 

 therefore, forty tliousand crystals exist in one square inch of 

 nettle leaf. 



In Pilea muscosa — a near ally of Urtica — I find a type of cysto- 

 lith diflTering widely from all forms heretofore described. Thej' 



are elongated and bent, in form, like 

 an Australian boomerang. They 

 lie in cells measuring only the Jg 

 of an inch long, and the ^i^ wide ; 

 and so abundant that quite one- 

 third of the entire leaf is occupied 

 with tlieni. Cystoliths of this mag- 

 nitude and singular form I believe 

 to be unknown to botanists. The 

 fd anient connecting each one with 

 its cell-wall is apparent. 



What is the significance of these 

 plant-crystals ? — and there are 

 others more numerous and more 

 beautiful — what their office in the 

 life of the plant? what part do they 

 act in supplying the salts of lime, 

 potash, and soda to the tissues of animals? AVill scientific agri - 

 culture answer?

Ahies concolor in Colorado. — Mr. Thomas Meehan announced 

 the discovery of .46i(^s (Picea of Loudon) concolor in Glen Eyrie, 

 near Pike's Peak, in Colorado, by Dr. Engelmann. When, how- 

 ever, he explored what was till tlien an unknown caiion in 1811, 

 and which by right of a first discovery he had named Caiion 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Engelmann, after his distinguished friend, and which name it still 

 retains, he found a considerable quantity in that caiion also. He 

 was attracted by the light green cones, as distinguished from the 

 purplish ones of Abies grandis, but on climbing the trees, and 

 examining the characters, he concluded it was but a variation 

 from A. grandia^ similar to what he was already familiar with in 

 A. bahamea. Prof. Porter had also found it in Cheyenne Caiion 

 in 1872; and, if really distinct from A. gi^andia^ it is probably 

 much more widely diflused through the Rocky Mountains than 

 has been supposed. 



Fertilization of Gentiana. — Mr. Thomas Meehan called atten- 

 tion to the fact that the autumn-blooming gentians were now in 

 flower ; and a close investigation promised an interesting field to 

 the botanist. They belonged to the class with gelatinous pollen, 

 and which was now believed to require the aid of insects in fertili- 

 zation ; bnt many of our species had closed coi'ollas, which seemed 

 to make fertilization by this agency difficult. In connection with 

 this subject he said Dr. Engelraan had made some curious obser- 

 vations on the gentians of the Jlocky Mountains. All the large 

 flowered species (as Gentiana affinis^ G.frigida, G. Parryi^ etc.) 

 have the anthers definitely fixed, and open outwards towards 

 the corolla; while those of the smaller species (such as G. acuta, 

 and neighboring genera, Swertia and Phmrogyne) have the face 

 of the anthers directed towards the ovary at an early stage of 

 development, but, on expansion of the corolla, are thrown over 

 the filament, and then face outwards as the others. The stigma 

 is cloven, but the lobes do not expand till several hours after the 

 anthers have shed their pollen. Mr. Meehan finds the anthers of 

 the large flowered eastern species accord with Dr. Engelman's 

 observations on tlie Colorado ones, in having the anthers fixed 

 from the first outwardl}', at least in all that he has been able to 

 examine. 



Variations in Leaves of Ailanthus gJandidosa. — Some leaflets 

 gathered from tlie trees by Dr. H. Leffman were exhibited, in 

 which the usual lanceolate form was departed from, and a triangu- 

 larly hastate, or aceriform shape, assumed. 



Note on Dryocampa. — Prof. Leidy stated that the oaks in the 

 forests of New Jerse}^, during the last summer, were greatly devas- 

 tated by the Drj-ocampa senatoria. In the early part of Septem- 

 ber, in passing along the edge of a forest skirting a cranberry 

 swamp, at Abseccnn, New Jersey, he had observed multitudes of 

 the Dryocampa lying dead on the swamp and all bristling with the 

 singular fungus Achlya prolifera.

ON A NEW VARIETY OF HELIX. 



BY JAS. LEWIS, M.D. 



Among the interesting sliells observed recently bj'^ Miss Law 

 among the mountains of Xorth Carolina, near Haj^esville, is a 

 variety of Helix (Stenotrema) monodon, Rackett, of which there 

 appears to be no record. The shells in question present the un- 

 mistakable characters of monodon modified in the following par- 

 ticulars: The whorls are more flattened than usual, making the 

 whole shell flattened and more discoidal than has hitherto been 

 remarked of this species. The periphery is slightly' carinate or 

 onl}' obsoletely carinate, specimens var3nng slightly among each 

 other in this respect. The larger number of specimens are marked 

 with a single, faint, brown band on the periplier3',in which respect 

 may be observed a habit comparable with what has heretofore 

 been remarked of banded specimens of Mesodon elevata. The 

 presence of this band on some of the shells imparts a somewhat 

 variegated aspect to the superior portion of the shell. 



It is scarcely to be presumed that specific characters will be 

 predicated upon the variable features above mentioned, but the 

 variety seems to be so well characterized as to deserve a name by 

 which to distinguish it, and I therefore venture to propose for it 

 the following designation, viz., Helix (Stenotrema) monodon, 

 Racket, var. cincta. 



Specimens from near Hayesville, Clay Co., X. C, are herewith 

 presented in the name of Miss Law.

A paper entitled " On new species of Noctuidas," by Aug. R. 

 Grote, was presented for publication. 



The President read the following extract from a letter written 

 b3' Prof. Edvv. D. Cope, and dated " Camp near Nacimiento, N. M., 

 Oct. 11, 18*14 :" " I have been camped for some five weeks in this 

 region with five men, forming one of Lieut. Wheeler's surveying 

 parties. I find much of interest geologicall}-, paleontologicallj', 

 and archa^ologically, and have an agreeable location in a country 

 with good water, timber, and grass, and, I may add, Indians. The 

 latter are Apaches, TJtes, and Navajoes, all friendl}'. I find many 

 remarkable ruins of rude stone buildings of an extinct race, with 

 great quantities of broken pottery. I discovered a ruined stone 

 village of twent3'-five houses arranged on the edge of a cretaceous 

 sandstone hog-back, from six to twelve feet wide only, and 250 to 

 300 feet perpendicular on one side, and on the other sloping at an 

 angle of 45° to 60°, besides other ruins in regions now entirely 

 waterless." 



Dr. F. Y. Hayden exhibited a scries of photographs of ruins 

 similar in character to those spoken of by Prof. Cope. The 

 builders were supposed to be the ancestors of the Moquis. 



Wheat and Chess. — The specimen of wheat ( Triticum) with a 

 head of cheat {Broynus) apparently' growing from a joint of the 

 former plant, which had been presented to the Academ\^ at the 

 meeting of Oct. 6, having been referred to Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt 

 for examination, he made the following report: — 



After rendering the chafl' of both plants transparent, and tinting 

 properly, so as to render every mor))hological element distinct for 

 stud}', and after treating the doubtful outgrowth similarly, I pre- 

 sent the three specimens to the meml)ers for study. 



I will call attention to onl}' a few points of structure in each. In 

 the upper glume of the wheat, on the inside surface against which 

 the grain lies, the cells are large, and are bounded at their ends by 

 cell-walls wevivly transverse to the long diameter of the cells. In 

 corresponding cells in cheat the ends of the cells are bounded by 

 oblique lines generally. In the outer or epidermal cells of both 

 plants silica is abundant, the deposit occurring at the ends of the 




164 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



cells, but in granules differently formed in the wheat, from those 

 in the cheat. 



It is impossible to convey in words, an idea of this difference 

 in form. In the clieat the silica granules are larger and more 

 abundant than in wheat. 



In the upper glumes of both plants there are from three to nine 

 veins. In the wheat not more than one vein is bordered with 

 stomata, in cheat every vein has on either side a distinct row of 

 large stomata, and this peculiarity of structure is so distinctive 

 that the botanist can pick from a bushel of the mixed glumes of 

 both plants, all that belong to the cheat, without possibility of 

 mistake. Other points of dissimilarity are obvious, but I have 

 stated enough to make a comparison with the doubtful outgrowth. 



In this doubtful outgrowth from tlic head of wheat I find the 

 obliquely ending internal cells in the upper glume, in the epidermal 

 cells, silica deposits identical in form and position with the cheat, and 

 unlike the wheat, and every vein is bordered with a row of stomata 

 on either side. Every morphological element of the outgrowth 

 corresponds in form to analogous elements in the cheat. I am 

 compelled therefore to pronounce it undoubted Bromus and not 

 Triticum. But I would report further. 



Seize now, very gentl^y, this remarkable outgrowth, with delicate 

 forceps, and out comes the Bromus from the Triticum, and the 

 trick is exposed. The Bromus has been introduced into the Triti- 

 cum artificially, and the cement employed to make the deception 

 more secure still adheres in flakes to the artificial parasite, and 

 resembles in appearances gum tragacanth. A beautiful fungus, 

 moreover, has found a nidus in the gum solution while fresh, and 

 is not found elsewhere on the wheat. The stem of the Bromus 

 which was inserted into the wheat, bears on its epidermal surface 

 minute outgrowths resembling precisely those on the correspond- 

 ing parts of the i)lant which is separate from the wheat. Now, on 

 natural! (/ internal surfaces such epidermic outgrowths never occur; 

 I have no hesitation, therefore, in pronouncing this specimen cheat, 

 neither do I think the workman has been expert in his manipula- 

 tion.

Mountain Drainage of Eastern Teimessee and Western North 

 Carolina. Ancient Burial Custom. — Joseph Willcox made some 

 statements in reference to the drainage of the mountain region of 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina. Tlie Blue Ridge 

 there attains its greatest development, both in width and altitnde; 

 its width being from 50 to 70 miles, while more than 30 of its 

 peaks attain an altitude exceeding 6000 feet. The western border 

 range, called the Smok}^ Mountains, is as high as the eastern range, 

 styled the Blue Ridge ; 3'et all of the streams that drain this region 

 flow to the west, cutting deep gorges through the Smoky Moun- 

 tains. Having visited this region on several occasions recently, 

 Mr. Willcox observed that the eastern and central portions of it 

 consist of gneiss rocks, while the western portion is composed of 

 other sedimentary rocks. It is presumed that the former was up- 

 heaved at a time long anterior to the elevation of the latter, and 

 the drainage system, having once been established to the west- 

 ward, continued its erosion during the subsequent elevation of the 

 Smok^' Mountains. 



Mr. Willcox also stated that when recently in North Carolina 

 his attention was called to an unusual method of burial by an an- 

 cient race of Indians in that vicinit3\ In numerous instances 

 liurial places were discovered where the bodies had been placed 

 with the face up, and coA'cred with a coating of plastic clay about 

 an inch thick. A pile of wood was then placed on top and fired, 

 which consumed tlie body and baked the clay, which retained the 

 impression of the body. This was then lightl}' covered with earth. 



Notice of Remaina of TitanotheyHum Prof. Leidy directed 



attention to two fossils recently received through Prof Ilayden. 

 The}' consist of an isolated last lower molar tooth and a lower 

 jaw fragment containing three teeth. The specimens are part of 

 a skeleton, most of the bones of which were found about one 

 hundred miles east of Greeley, Colorado. 



The last lower molar tootli is identical in character with that 

 referred to Titanofherium Proidii {Ancient Fauna of Nebraska, 

 pi. xvii. figs. 8, 9, 10), except that its outer basal ridge is less well 

 developed. The fore and aft diameter of the crown is three and 

 one-quarter inches; the width in front 19 lines. 



The teeth of the lower jaw fragment are either the last three 

 premolars, or the last two of these and the first molar. They are 

 like the corresponding teeth of Titanotherhun Proutii. In all, 

 the crowns are bilobed. The series of three teetli measures, fore 

 and aft, four inches and five lines. The first of the series meas- 

 ures, fore and aft, \i^ lines; the second 16j, and the tliird 21 

 lines. A large mental foramen is situated about an inch and a 

 half below the interval of the anterior two teeth. 



These remains I suspect to belong to the animal indicated under 

 the name of Ilegacerops coloi'aclensis (Extinct Vertebrate Fauna 

 of the Western Territories). This, from all the evidence I have 

 thus far seen, appears to be of tlie same genus as Titanotheriuni, 

 to which I also suspect the genus JJronfotherium of Prof. Marsh, 




166 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



and the genera Symborodon and 3Iiobasileus of Prof. Cope be- 

 long. 



Last summer, in passing through New Haven, I had au oppor- 

 tunity^ of seeing the fossils referred by Prof. Marsh to Brontothe- 

 rium. Among them I saw an incisor tooth, which is like one in 

 the museum of the Academ,y. The latter specimen accompanied 

 some remains of Titanothe^Hum from White River, Dakota. The 

 crown forms an irregular hemisphere, and measures from 5 to 5^ 

 lines in diameter. 



The examination of the skull, described b}^ Prof. Marsh, under 

 the name of Brontotherium^ and an inspection of the skulls, ex- 

 hibited to the Academ}^ last June b}^ Prof. Cope, and referred by 

 him to Symborodon, confirmed my suspicion that these two named 

 genera are synonymous with Titaiwtherium. I also suspect from 

 the cursory examination of the specimens of Profs. Marsh and 

 Cope, that the number of species will probably be reduced to one 

 or two. 



Notices of Bhizopods. — Prof. Leidy exhibited drawings of the 

 beautiful Actinophryan, Glathrulina elegans, described by Cien- 

 kowski and otlier European naturalists. It was found abundanth'- 

 on Utricularia, at Absecom, New .Terse v. The more mature speci- 

 mens have a broAvnish or yellowish color. The spherical, fenes- 

 trated, siliceous shell measures from ^^^ th to ^Vth mm. in diameter. 

 The interior Actinoplirys-like body is about ^'^th mm. in diameter, 

 and gives off a multitude of delicate rays which extend through 

 the fenestra of the shell. The stem of attachment of the shell 

 measures \t\\ of a mm. or more in length. 



The maturer specimens frequently' have others attached to their 

 shell, usually one, but as many as six were observed radiating on 

 their slender stems from the parent shell. These secondary shells 

 are slightly smaller than the others, are colorless, and often so 

 delicate and transparent that the fenestrate character, if it exists, 

 is invisible. 



In a number of detached specimens of Glathrulina, the shell 

 was occupied by a central, ra3dess, granular mass, from ^\jth to 

 ^'yth mm. in diameter. 



Prof. Letdy also exhibited drawings of Acfinosphserium Eich- 

 hornii, which, though not so common as Actinophrys sol, is fre- 

 quently^ found in the ponds and ditches in the vicinity of Phila- 

 delphia. It varies considerably in size, ranging from ^^^th ram. 

 to I mm. in diameter. Some exhibit a multitude of rays, others 

 a few, and some observed, of large size, alive and active, were 

 utterly rayless. 



Drawings were also exhibited of Acanthocystis mridis. This 

 remarkable rhizopod occurs frequently in all the ponds and ditches 

 in the vicinit}' of the city. It is either very polymorphous, or else 

 perhaps several species may be included under the one name. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OE PHILADELPHIA. 167 



Some are green from the chloropliyl balls occupying the superfi- 

 cial part of the body. Others exactly alike in all other points of 

 structure are colorless. From the body project a multitude of 

 exceedingly delicate spines with discoid bases and furcate ends. 

 Ra3's also like those of AcHnophrya project beyond the spines. 

 Both rays and spines in the immediate vicinity of the body are 

 enveloped in a stratum of exceedingly minute vibrio-like spicules. 

 The green specimens of Acanthocijstis, independently of rays and 

 spines, measure about j^^tli mm. in diameter; the colorless ones 

 measured about one-half the size of the former. 



Drawings were also exhibited of an Aetinophryan, of which a 

 number of individuals lived together in colonies. These are not 

 unfrequently met with in the same positions as Acanthocydis and 

 Actinoiiphserium. The species appears to be the same as that 

 recently described by Hertwig and Lesser, in the Archiv fur Mi- 

 krof<lcop)ische Anatomies 1874, plate iv. fig. 1, under the name of 

 Baphidioplwys elcgans. I have repeatedly met with the creature 

 in colonies from half a dozen up to forty. The whole colony moves 

 along with much greater rapidity than Actinophryti sol. The in- 

 dividuals measure o'gth mm. in diameter, and project a multitude 

 of rays extending to ith mm. in length. In colony the bodies are 

 conjoined b}- bridges or isthmi, through which chlorophyl balls 

 and granules incessantly but slowly pass from one to another. 

 The bodies and the bases of the rays are enveloped in an atmos- 

 phere of exceedingly delicate semicircular spicules. The animals 

 take their food in the same manner as Actinophrys sol. A colony 

 of thirty -eight was observed to break up into three separate colo- 

 nies numbering several!}^ fifteen, ten, and thirteen, each of which 

 moved away in a different direction. 



Drawings were exhibited of Amoeba qvadtnlmeata, Carter, a 

 common species in the vvaters in the vicinity of Philadelphia. It 

 is about -r'sth mm. in length b}' ^^^th mm. in breadth. The species 

 is remarkable especially for the retention of the four delicate lon- 

 gitudinal folds in all its movements. 



Drawings of two other species of Amceha were exhibited, which 

 are supposed to differ from those previously described. They were 

 characterized as follows: — 



Amceba viridis. — Bright green from the multitude of contained 

 chlorophyl balls. Form of body irregularly stellate, with thick 

 conical pseudopods projecting in all directions. Sarcodic sub- 

 stance colorless and finely granular. Neither nucleus nor vacuoles

On Supposed Spe^^maries in Amceba — Prof Leidy stated that 

 in an exnmination of a large Amoeba, from Absecom Pond, N. J., 

 he had observed a point of structure which he had not previously 

 noticed in any of the species. The Amoeba generally assumed a 

 globular or oval form from the j',, to the |- of a line in diameter. 

 It projected from any part of its circumference digitiform pseu- 

 dopods up to ^'j of a line by the j^^ of a line thick. The gran- 

 ular matter of the entosarc was mingled with a multitude of brown 

 food balls, and numerous crystals, most of which appeared to be 

 of isometric forms. The coarser granules of the entosarc rarely 

 entered even the base of the pseudopods. 



The uniformly granular nucleus, immersed in the entosarc, 

 measured about ^^^ of a line in diameter. The contractile vesicle 

 measured ,yV of a line. With a j'^ immersion objective lens, there 

 were observed around the circumference of the contractile vesicle, 

 half-a-dozen granulated spheres, from y^^ to -^^ of a line in 

 diameter. Tlie granules of these spheres appeared to be of uni- 

 form size, and exliibited an active swarming movement, resembling 

 the motion of spermatozoids. I could not isolate the spheres to 

 examine them more definitely, nor could I detect the ordinary 

 spermatozoid form among the closely swarming granules. I have 

 suspected that these granular spheres were spermaries ? After 

 having detected them with the ^^ objective lens, I could barely 

 see them with the I objective. 



On the Geology of Certain Lands in Ritchie and Tyler Coun- 

 ties, W. Va. — Prof Persifor Frazer, Jr., asked the attention of 

 the meeting while he described, as follows, the geological features 

 of two tracts of land in Ritchie and Tyler Counties, W. Va., be- 

 longing to the Academ}', and which he had recently been requested 

 to examine as an expert. The tract in Ritchie County exclusively 

 comprises a tolerabl}' regular parallelogram, whose sides run north- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 169 



cast and northwest, and whose ai'ea includes about seventeen hun- 

 dred and eight^'-seven acres, divided into unequal parts, botli by 

 the Hughes River and by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The 

 north angle of the propert}' is distant about half a mile from the 

 station of Cornwallis on the above railroad. 



The lands themselves resemble in general character thousands 

 of square miles of territory both in West Virginia and Pennsylva- 

 nia, which are situated in the coal measures. They nia}^ be de- 

 scribed as very thick deposits of sandstone and shale through 

 whose almost horizontal strata the numerous small streams have 

 cut precipitous ravines to a depth of three hundred and fifty or 

 four hundred feet. The soil, which is what is known in that part 

 of the country as "white sand soil," is generally light and poor, 

 and, except in the alluvial bottoms, unsuited to the production of 

 fine cereal crops. 



These hills and plateaus are covered with forest vegetation of 

 different kinds, the most abundant representatives of which are 

 white, red, and black oak, chestnut oak, poplar, beech, hickory 

 and ash, white and 3'ellow pine. Locust is almost imknown on 

 the tract near Harrisville, though frequently met with in the 

 northern part of the county. The greatest value of the land is 

 for its production of white oak and poplar, especially the former, 

 which is cut into railroad ties and barrel staves. 



Both the Harrisville and the Tyler Count}^ tracts are situated 

 upon the so-called coal measures of West Virginia, and the former 

 of these is about ten to fifteen miles east of the town of Petro- 

 leum. So far as the mineral resources of this property (the Har- 

 risville tract) are concerned, the excitement which a few years ago 

 was allayed after an enormous expenditure of money in futile 

 efforts to procure oil in the district embracing Ellenboro', Harris- 

 ville, and Cornwallis, furnishes us with the means of making a 

 very fair estimate of them. Nothing but oil, coal, iron ore, or 

 clay is to be anticipated, and the very numerous bore-holes sunk 

 to procure the first of these presents us with seven hundred and 

 fifty feet of measures, in no horizon of which is there a workable 

 bed of coal. The formation, with its plates of sandstone and shale, 

 is almost horizontal, and rolls gently east and west with a dip of 

 2° or less; and though different sections of these hills varied the 

 order of recurrence of their sandstone, flags, and shale, the posi- 

 tion of the only coal seam found was constant, and near the beds 

 of the streams. The coal bed was opened along a small run enter- 

 ing the south corner of the Harrisville tract in several places. In 

 order to ascertain the true position of this deposit with reference 

 to the rocks on the property which lie about one-quarter of a mile 

 northwest of the largest opening, a line was run connecting to- 

 gether the south corner of the tract, the bore-hole, and this open- 

 ing. This line was only a rough approximation to the truth, the 

 distances being obtained by pacing, and the altitudes by the eye, 

 12 




no PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



but it was clearly evident that the coal miderlay the whole tract 

 where it had not been washed out by the streams. I could obtain 

 no exact information as to its value nor even a fair sample of it, 

 the excavations having been nearly filled with dirt. If this bed 

 should prove to be the same as that opened near Ellenboro', it 

 will probably average from fourteen inches to eighteen inches in 

 thickness and may be of good quality, but cannot for many years 

 add any great value to the lands under which it occurs. Tliis is 

 the only coal of which an^'thing is known, although the bore-hole 

 of which I am about to speak developed a bed of black slates at a 

 much lower level. 



The bore-hole alluded to was sunk b}* Mr. Moats, and lies about 

 three hundred feet inside the southeast property Hue, and about 

 thirty feet north of the road. The record of this exploitation was, 

 as usual, not kept, and the account which follows, taken entirely 

 from remembrance of the alternation of strata, must be accepted 

 with great allowance, and is rather valuable as indicating what 

 was not found than for any positive results ascertained.

 and it seemed of good qualit}-.

This brings the rocks down to about the level of the bore-hole, 

 and renders it probable that the first fifty feet through which the 

 hole was sunk included the first sand rock. 



It will be remarked that in the section here described no place 

 is given to the eighteen-inch coal bed, which occurs a little higher 

 up the run. Its position is to be looked for in the fifty feet through 

 which Mr. Moats first passed. He may not have noticed it; or he 

 may have forgotten it ; or (which is very probable) these fifty feet 

 below the general level of the bank of the run may consist of loose 

 debris which the stream has torn out and scattered along its course 

 where the soft coal would have disappeared. 



It would be disloyal to science to hazard an opinion on the true 

 horizon of these measures without the most careful instrumental

work, and a thorough comparison of the labors of the Pennsylva- 

 nia and Oliio geologists, as well as the more recent sections of 

 Stevenson and White. 



It has been stated that the measures are almost horizontal, hav- 

 ing a dip of about 2° or less from low axes, which are generally 

 north and south. Mr. I. C. White, in his preliminar}' introduction 

 to his "Notes on the Upper Coal Measures of Western Virginia 

 and Pennsylvania," read before the Lyceum of Natural History- of 

 New York, and reprinted from their Annals, speaks of the " Divid- 

 ing Ridge" as a watershed between the tributaries of the Monon- 

 gahela and those of the Ohio, which occupies the median line of a 

 gentle anticlinal axis which passes across the coal measures from 

 north to south. 



There are, without doubt, many of these gentle north and south 

 axes in the southwestern coal measures — at least in Tyler, Ritchie, 

 and Pleasant Counties, and one of them on the western limits of 

 the Academy's Harrisville tract sheds the oil as well as the water. 



Geologicall}' there seems to be no reason to expect any great 

 development of mineral resources. 



Tylei- Goiinty Tract. — During the entire time occupied by the 

 examination of the lands of tlie Academj-, extensive forest fires 

 prevailed, and the whole region was densely clouded with smoke, 

 which not only made it impossible to get any extended view of the 

 countr}', but so completely obscured the sun that at 3 P.M. it was 

 not possible to indicate its position in the ^kj. This smoke short- 

 ened the day and prevented me from visiting certain tracts whei'e 

 the fires were jjrevailing. 



The so-called Tyler County tract lies across the border of Tyler 

 and Ritchie Counties, from the headwaters of the largest tributar^y 

 to McKim Creek, across the " Dry Ridge" to the banks of Hughes 

 River. It contains more bottom and, therefore, more arable land 

 than the Harrisville tract, and what parts have not been settled 

 on contain an abundance of fine timber. 



What I have said of the structure of the Harrisville tract applies 

 largely to that of the Tjder County tract, though the i)Overty of 

 the country in coal in the latter must be assumed on different 

 grounds from that of the former, where numerous borings made 

 in the search after oil served to show the absence of coal within a 

 reasonable distance below the surface; while here there are no 

 such exploitations. 



About three miles south-southwest of the lower corner of the 

 Tyler-Ritchie tract, on the property of Mr. Campbell I discov- 

 ered a thin bed of coal, which, from what 1 could learn, agreed in 

 general description with the thin seam opened in tlie base of the 

 hills near Ellenboro'. It would l)e rash to generalize, from a hur- 

 ried observation of a bed beneath tlie surface of a run, a continuity 

 with the Ellenboro' bed eight miles distant, but so far as I could 

 carry the measures southward by a rapid transit over them, they 




172 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



bore out the identity. If this be truly the same thin seam which 

 crops out near EUenboro', and which I have supposed to be the 

 same as that on Mr. Moat's farm, there is no difficulty in prophe- 

 sying an absence of coal and oil from these Tyler County lands. 

 If the seams are not the same the structure must be so complicated 

 as to need a special study. The chances, however, are very much 

 against the existence of valuable mineral deposits on the I'yler- 

 Ritchie tract. 



Prof. Lesley remarked that he had not had an opportunity to 

 speak with Prof. Frazer before the presentation of his report, but 

 that he had seen Mr. Stevenson lately, who informed him of a 

 very important observation which he had made in the region of 

 the Harrisville tract. 



Mr. Stevenson had satisfied himself of the existence of a fault 

 on the Hughes River which brought up the lower measures hori- 

 zontally against the middle barren group of coal measures which 

 lay westward of them. 



Prof. Lesley regretted the absence of Mr. Stevenson, who could 

 of course much better explain his own views on this subject, but 

 he believed that this fact had a most important bearing on the 

 geology of the whole region. 



Prof. Frazer asked liow the horizontal structure of this faulted 

 district could be satisfactorily accounted for; to which Prof. 

 Lesley replied that it would necessitate the supposition of a 

 vertical drop of the region west of a north and south line of 

 fracture parallel to, and perhaps synonymous with, the " Oil 

 Break" anticlinal, which is only a few miles further west. 



In reply to a question as to his opinion of the probability of 

 the sandstone of the downthrown region being the representation 

 of the Mahoning sandstone. Prof Lesley said that he understood 

 Prof. Stevenson to hold that opinion. 



The Committees to which they had been referred recommended 

 the following papers to be published: —

 he is at pains to say in one place that " 3/»s leucopus, Neotoma and Sigmodon

and Neotoma. Naturalists soon perceived the supergeneric value of this 

 assemblage, and sought to eliminate various groups under other generic 

 appellations. Waterhouse himself established a number of divisions which, 

 with some modifications, have been generally accepted. In North America, 

 Sigmodon and Neotoma, with the so-called '■^BeiiJirodon,'''' stand well apart 

 from IIe!<peromy.9 ; in South America, Ilolocheilus and the true Reithrodon 

 seem perfectly distinct. The rest of the American mice (at least so far as 

 I know them) most probably fall under a restricted genus Hesperomys; 

 "we have only to tie this name down to the strict value of a genus, pin it to 

 its type, and establish among the numerous species what subgeneric divi- 

 sions we can. From the circumstances of its founding it is difficult to say 

 what should be considered the type of^IIe^peromyi^. Waterhouse, in drawing 

 his comparisons between 3Iu,s and the New World mice, took M. rattus and 

 M. Minaculatus for such purpose ; we may properly therefore elect the 

 latter as technically the type. But wlien Waterhouse, in 1837, established 

 CalomyH upon C. elegans, he included in it hotli bi?naculatus and gracili2)es ; 

 and Eligmodontia of F. Cuvier is strictly coequal. It becomes a question 

 whether one of these names should not stand in place of Hesperomys as re- 

 stricted ; but as the latter is firmly established, as Galomys is by the same 

 autlior, and as Eligmodontia is no earlier, there may be no necessity for a 

 change. Resting then upon this strict application of He.iperomys to such 

 species as himaculatus, elegdtm, and gracilipes, we may inquire how nearly, 

 if at all, the North American Vesper-mice agree witli it. In his essay of 

 1857, Prof. Baird elaborately details the characters of tlie South American 

 species, and, excluding Reithi-odon and Holocheilus as full genera, makes 

 Hespei'omys to include three subgenera, viz., Calo7nys Wsiterh., EabrotTirix 

 {=H((broihnx plus P/iyllotis, Waterh.) and Oxymicterus {■=Oxymictenis 

 plus Scapteromys, Waterh. ) . Among Nortli American forms, he establishes 

 three subgenera, Hesperomys, Onychomys, and Oryzomys. 1 confirm tliese 

 last unequivocally ; the only point being whether the leucopits group, which 

 Baird left in Hesperomys, is not also a group subgenerically different from 

 that including elegans, bimaculatus, etc. All the North American mice 

 seem to be differentiated from tliose of South America by characters of 

 more than specific importance ; the closest approach that I am aware of 

 being found in the leucopus group, a species of whicli — nuttalli, yellowish 

 underneath — comes near Calomys. 



I propose to retain Hesperomys for all the North as well as certain South 

 American species, and to divide tlie former into three subgenera; Vesper imus, 

 Mihi, Onychomys, Baird, and Oryzomys, Baird.

Descr. from No. 10,183, Mus. Smiths., Sta. Efigenia, Sumichrast. 

 General aspect of a species of the leucopus group. Large ; nose 

 to eye 0.62 (inches and hundredths), to ear 1.12, to occiput 1.40, 

 to tail 4.15 ; tail 5.00 ; fore foot 0.42 ; hind foot 1.04 ; ear 0.V8 above 

 notch. Tail a little longer than head and body, slender, scant-haired- 

 Absolute and relative proportions of feet and digits as in F. leu- 

 copus-^ soles hair}' on posterior third. Ears large, leafy, ap- 

 parently naked, really closely pilous. Whiskers reaching to or 

 beyond the shoulder. Skull strictly as in V. leucopus (palate 

 ending opposite last molars, not far behind it as in Jfws, Oryzomys^ 

 etc.), but not quite so thin and paper}', and developing a slight 

 bead on the orbital border, as in the stouter mice generally. 

 Color above giving the general impression of a gray mouse, rather 

 than a red mouse with darker dorsal area as in leucopus and 

 aztecus. It is gray, brightened with fulvous, slightly darker 

 along the back, more decidedly fulvous laterally, and everywhere 

 with a peculiar slight glaucous or hoary shade. Head noticeably 

 purer gray; eye encircled ivith a black ring in marked contrast ., 

 the edges of the lids, and a little anteocular spot, being jet black. 

 (This suggests the specific name; I have seen nothing like it else- 

 where.) Color below, pure white, the plumbeous roots of the 

 hairs, however, giving a slight grayish cast. Line of demarcation 

 of this white with the color of the upper parts everywhere abrupt. 

 Outside of fore leg colored to the very wrist, but back of the hand 

 white. Hind leg also colored to and a little beyond the ankle? 

 forming a definite dark spot on the base of the metatarsus, the 

 remaining five-sixths of the foot being pure white. Tail above, 

 like the back; below, gray — not white; and the line of demarca- 

 tion, though evident, not sharp. No yellowish or fulvous tinge 

 anywhere on the under parts {'■'•mexicanus^^ of De Saussure is said 

 to be yellowish on the chin and breast). Skull 1.20 long by 0.64 

 broad.

 but I cannot so identify it, and prefer to err on the safe side, if at 

 all. Besides the above specimen, I have others from Tehuacan

 American species. A female shows three pair of mainmoe — one

Obs. The occurrence in North America of sigraodont mice with 

 sulcate incisors was first noticed in 1841 by Audubon aud Bach- 

 man, who described Mus humilis. Their animal was soon referred 

 to Hesperomys by Wagner. But the peculiarity of the upper 

 incisors was overlooked until 1853, when Maj. Le Conte took up 

 the point and referred a species to the South American genus 

 Reithrodon — a course followed by Prof. Baird in 1857, when the 

 latter described three supposed new species, R. montanus^ viega- 

 lotis, and longicauda. But sulcation of the incisors is almost the 

 onl^'^ character that Ochetodon shares with Reithrodon ; the two 

 genera are otherwise widely different.'

 descending process large, subquadrate, the emargination between this and the con- 

 dyle deep. Size large; form stout and compact ; head broad and arched ; eyes large

Most of which is widely different from what obtains in Ochetodon, the 

 grooving of the incisors being merely a coincidence. Xor am I satisfied 

 that the three supposed species of Beithrodon are strictly congeneric. They 

 differ among themselves in cranial as well as external characters, to an 

 extent at least warranting subgeneric separation. In respects of palatal 

 structure and form of the anterior zj-gomatic root, there is a curious paral- 

 lelism with the same points in Sigmodon and Oryzomys. I will tabulate 

 some of the characters, as follows : — 



Beithrodon proper. (Type B. c^inictiloides.) Anterior root of zygoma 

 deeply emarginated in front. Palate ending much behind the molar series, 

 and showing a median ridge between lateral paired excavations. Ptery- 

 goid fosspe deeply excavated, and these bones closely approximated. In- 

 cisive foramina reaching bej'ond the first molars. Condylar process of 

 mandible concave internally ; descending process rounded off inferiorly ; 

 coronoid process very oblique. Species B. cuniculoides, Waterh., P. Z. S.

 root of zygoma nearly straight in front. Palate ending nearly opposite the 

 last molars, but slightly ridged or excavated. Pterygoid fossfe shallow ; 

 these bones less approximated. Incisive foramen only reaching to first 

 molars. Condylar process of mandible flat internally ; descending process 

 angular; coronoid process nearly vertical. Species^. (^.) chinchilloides,

Obs. The limits I would set to Armcola may be gathered from 

 the foregoing, though doubtless some synonj^ms, and, perhaps, 

 some tenable subgeneric names, of old world forms, have escaped 

 me. Witliout, therefore, writing out the full diagnosis, I will 

 simply mention characters which separate Arvicola as I accept it 

 from the other North American Arijicolinse : — 



Molars normally rootless, perennial {cf. Evotomys). Folds of 

 enamel fusing at the re-entrances {cf. Evotomya). Molars viewed 

 from above about equally serrate on either side (cf. llyodes, 

 Synaptomys). UiDper molars all subequal in length and breadth 

 {cf Myodes^ Synajytomys). Middle lower molar of 4-5 prisms, 

 the last a transv^erse loop, the rest alternating lateral triangles (cf. 

 Evotomys). Back lower molar of not more than 3 prisms seriatim 

 {cf Synajjfomys, 3Iyodes), each making a transverse loop. Gene- 

 ral molar pattern, as to number of prisms to a tooth, as shared 

 by most Arvicolinae {cf Cuniculus). Upper incisors plane (cf 

 Synaptomys). Hoots of under incisors running up the condylar 

 process forming a ridge that only subsides near the notch between 

 condyle and descending process {cf Synaj^fomys, 3Iyodes, Cuni- 

 culus). Palate not ending behind in a flat straight-edged shelf 

 {cf Evotomys, 3Iyodes, Cuniculus). Coronoid process as high as 

 cond3de {cf. Evotomys). Ears moderately developed {cf. Myodes, 

 Cuniculus), but not overtopping the fur {cf Evotomys). Tail 

 longer than foot (c^. Myodes, Cuyiiculus). Fore claws of normal 

 size and growth {cf. Cuniculus). The species do not turn white 

 in winter (cf. Cuniculus). Many other details could be adduced. 

 The North American species fall in four sections or subgenera, 

 as established by Baird. I use Myonomes, Raf , for the section 

 for which Baird employed Hemiotomys, Selys, as none of our sec- 

 tions seem exactly the same as any one of Europe. Pedomys and 

 Pitymys are like each other in skull and dentition, but otter ex- 

 ternal peculiarities. The sections may be thus analyzed: — 



A. Myonomes. Back upper molar with 2 external triangles and a pos- 



terior crescent. Middle upper molar with 2 internal triangles. Front 

 lower molar with 3 internal and 2 or 3 external lateral triangles. 

 Ears unrimmed in front. Soles 6-tuberculate. Fore claws not longer 

 than the hinder ones. Tail about ^ the length of head and body, or 

 more. Pelage ordinary. Size maximum and medium. 



B. CniLOTUS. Back upper molar with only 1 external triangle and a pos- 



terior trefoil. Middle upper molar with 1 internal triangle. Front 

 lower molar with 3 internal and 2 or 3 external triangles (as in 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 189 



Myonomes). Ear with a rim in front of meatus, the anterior and 

 posterior roots of the auricle there meeting. Soles 5-tuberculate (?). 

 Fore claws not larger than the hinder. Tail about ^ the head and 

 body. Pelage ordinary. Size minimum. 



C. Pedomys. Back and middle upper molars as in the last. Front lower 

 molar with only 2 internal and 1 external triangle. Ear unrinimed. 

 Soles 5-tuberculate. Fore claws not larger than the hinder. Tail ^ 

 the head and body, or rather less. Pelage ordinary. Size medium. 



1>. PiTYMYS. Molars all as in Pedomy>t. Ears unrimmed. Soles 5-tuber- 

 culate. Fore claws larger than the hinder. Tail about \ the head 

 and body, or less. Pelage dense, silky, mole-like. Size small.

Obs. This peculiar field mouse, which may prove entirely dis- 

 tinct from pinetorum, is specially interesting in coming from a 

 region where the genus was long supposed to be not represented. 

 I have never seen any other Arvicola from south of the United 

 States, nor is there, to mj' knowledge, but a single one hitherto 

 described from so low a latitude, on this hemisphere at least. This 

 is Arvicola {Hemiotomys) mexicaniis, De Sauss., R. M. Z. 1861, 

 3, a species apparently allied to A. riparius.

 Root of inferior incisor ending abruptly opposite last lower molar 

 (the root generally runs up to the condyle in ArvicoUnse). Con- 

 struction of molars, and general cranial characters as in Myodes. 

 Palate ending as in typical Armcola. External characters in 

 general of an ordinary arvicoline style, but in the very long soft 

 full pelage, short heav}'' head, and blunt muzzle, approaching the 

 Lemmings; nevertheless, ears equalling or overtopping the fur as 

 in Evotomys, and tail equally or exceeding the hind foot, as usual 

 in Armcola. 



Obs. Foregoing are the essential characters of the most remark- 

 able genus of the subfamily, one singnlarl}' combining peculiari- 

 ties of several widel}^ different arvicoline genera. It may be de- 

 fined in a word as skull and teeth of Myodes, in body of Arvicola, 

 with ears of Evotomys, and sui generis sulcation of upper incisors. 

 The genus was happily characterized in 1857, but upon such 

 miserably inadequate material,' that Prof. Baird did not formally 



' No. J^, Mus. S. I., merely a rat-eaten bunch of fur, lacking head, tail, 

 and three of the feet, with a defective skull ; and No. 1368, skin with feet 

 and tail, but no head, and no skull. Locality unknown, supposed United 

 States. Received from Wm. Cooper. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 193 



introduce either genus or species in tlie body of his work, though 

 in the introductory list he gives Synaptomys as a subgenus of 

 3Iyodes and catalogues a species, S. coopei'i. Though defined with 

 precision, as far as the material would allow, the genus remains 

 little known. I can indoise it unequivocall}', and add all details 

 hitherto wanting. There is probably no more strongly marked 

 genus o^ Arvic(Ainse. 



The groove of the upper incisor is deep, distinct, and runs near the 

 outer edge instead of along the middle (as in Ochetodon and Reithro- 

 don). The incisors are short, broad, and much curved ; their front 

 much bevelled off, so that, viewed in profile, one part of each incisor 

 stands in front of and parallel with the part on the other side of the 

 groove. These teeth tend to the Myodes pattern further in being- 

 enamel tubes not completely filled with dentine (calling to mind 

 an unfinished quill pen, after the first oblique slice is cut away) ; 

 their tips are not straightly transverse, and generally nicked at 

 the end of the groove. The under incisors, exactly as in Blyodes^ 

 stop as to their roots abruptly' just in front and inside of the last 

 lower molar; while in all other Armcolinae I have examined, ex- 

 cepting Ilyodes and Cuniculus, the root runs past (outside) the 

 lower molar up the ramus of the jaw to near the condyle, this 

 passage of the root making an obvious ridge, here wanting. In 

 Synajjtomys, as in the genera just mentioned, the whole condylar 

 ramus is tlius flat, with its inner surface nearly plane, separated 

 by a strong sulcus from the end of the alveolar portion of the jaw. 



As is well known, the molars of llyodes (restricted to exclude 

 Cuniculus)^ though essentially^ aggregated rootless prisms as in 

 other Araicolinse^ are quite different in their details of pattern. 

 Not to go here into detail, I may simply say, that the inner mar- 

 gin of the molar series is crenate, not sharply serrate like the 

 outer as in Ai-mcola. Now this pattern of BIyodes is duplicated 

 in Synaj'jtornys, and so is every other molar detail. Incisors aside, 

 the skull and teeth of Synaptomys are not distinguishable with 

 certaint}' from those of Myodes. Outside, Synaptomys is not a 

 lemming, but an Ai'vicola, one, too, with ears as large as in Evo- 

 tomys. An alcoholic specimen might be mistaken at first sight 

 for Arvicola austerus. One might suppose it originally a lem- 

 ming, stranded in time long past in latitude so low as to impress 

 upon it ordinary arvicoline exterior characters.

 ■ Obs. Of this species I have handled about forty specimens, the 

 first examined by an American naturalist for many years. They 

 differ somewdiat from the only two Siberian skins before me, pos- 

 sibly representing a variety (to be called Myodes helvolus) ; but I 

 am far from disputing Von Middendorff's decision as to theii" 

 specific identity with the Asiatic animal.

 Syst. Ofvers. Gnng. Glires, 1866 (same type). 

 Obs. Without going into the characters of a perfectly well- 

 known form, I wish to particularly^ signalize the fact that this 

 genus, tliough based upon a " lemming," is very different from 

 llyoden, and, indeed, from any other arvicoline type. The mohu' 

 pattern is strongly of an ordinary arvicoline general character — 

 not at all as in Myodes or Synaplomys — while details of the molar 

 dentition (as, for instance, six prisms on back upper molar and 

 nine on front lower molar) are unique. The obsolete ear and 

 pollex, the singular hypertrophy of tlie two middle fore claws, and 

 the notable seasonal changes of pelage, are all peculiar. I find 

 but one American species, identical with that of Asia. A second 

 supposed species, G. lagurus, I have not seen.

NEW SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN NOCTUID^:. 

 BY AUG. R. GROTE. 

 Acronycta exilis, n. s. 



9. A small species of the size of A. vinnula, and apparently 

 belonging to the group Triaena of Hiibner. Tiie fore wings are 

 pale, with a yellowish stain, noticeable on the ordinary spots and 

 on the sulimedian space. The median lines are wide apart, gemi- 

 nate, faint ; the t. p. line rectangularl}- exserted opposite the 

 cell, running inwardl}' below the median vein. Both the stigmata 

 are relatively large and vague, the reniform with a central ochery 

 stain, which becomes easily lost. The median sliade is obvious 

 between them on costal region. The costal region is regularly 

 dotted with pale black points at tlie inception of tlie lines; the 

 median sliade is very oblique, and tlie t. p. line lias a separate dot 

 for each of its component lines, here divaricate; there is also an 

 independent dot midway between tlie median shade and the inner 

 dot of the t. p. line, above tlie reniform, wanting in the succeedino- 

 species. A very narrow black dash above internal angle, broken 

 before the margin. The basal streak and that opposite the cell 

 are obsolete. Hind wings pale fuscous, with wiiitish frino-es 

 reflecting the markings of the under surface where the common 

 line is distinct and lunulate on the hind wings, more dentate and 

 medially exserted on primaries. A discal hinule on hind wino-s • 

 on the more fuscous primaries a discal dash joined to the dark- 

 marked crossvein. Head and thorax pale like the fore wino-s- 

 black at the sides of the basal joints. Legs pale ; tarsi black- 

 dotted. 



Expanse 30 mm. Habitat. New York (E. L. Graef). 



Acronycta pauper cula, n. s. 



9 . Of the same size and appearance as A. exilis, perhaps a 

 little slighter built. This species differs by the shape of the t. p. 

 line, which is more roundedl}^, less rectangular^' exserted opposite 

 the cell than in its all}', and notably less inwardly inflected below 

 the median vein ; its position is similar in the two species. The 

 costal dots are fewer and wider apart, that above the reniform in 

 A. exilis is here wanting. The geminate t. p. line is finer, the 

 outer line more distinctly black, the inner faint ; the orbicular is 




198 PROCEEDINGS Or THE ACADEMY OF 



a small complete annulus. The black basal streak is distinct, 

 furcate on the oblique, geminate, waved t. a. line. The streak 

 above the internal angle is distinct and continuous, and there is a 

 faint darker shading outside of the t. p. line opposite the cell con- 

 taining an obsolete streak. The whitish fringes are distinctly 

 black-dotted. Hind wings as in A. exilis. Beneath the common 

 line is faint and appears more even and straighter on the primaries 

 than in its ally. 



Expanse 30 mm. Habitat. Texas (E. L. Graef). 



These closely allied species may be distinguished b}' the cha- 

 racters given above on close attention. A. ■paujjercula seems to 

 resemble A. interrupta, a species described by Guenee, from a 

 drawing by Abbot; it seems to differ in the characters of tlie 

 basal line as given by Guenee as Avell as in the color of tlie hind 

 wings which are not at all yellowish in eitlier of tlie two species 

 described by me. 

 Eutolype, n. g. 



A genus which I would refer to the Bombycoidea of v. Heine- 

 man. 



The e3'es are naked, and tlie small ocelli may be perceived on 

 their margin behind the antennoe. The S antennce are bipectinate, 

 thickly setose ; the pectinations increase in length on the inside 

 at basal third, and gradually taper thence to the tips, where they 

 become obsolete. The labial palpi are short, as in Dicopis, and 

 do not exceed the front, and are thickly haired with depending 

 beard. The whole body is shaggily haired, and the short unarmed 

 legs are nearly hidden by the lengthy vestiture. The thorax is 

 comparatively heavy and square, and its proportion to the abdo- 

 men is somewhat as in Dicopis. On the disk is a tuft of metallic 

 scales, such as have hitherto been recorded only of Eadryas and 

 Tob/pe. The wings are long and rather narrow, the primaries 

 with roundedly oblique external margin and defined apices. The 

 general aspect recalls the Notodontians, but veins 4 and 5 are 

 thrown off together on the fore wings, and the insect undoubtedly 

 is Xoctuidous. 

 Eutolype Rolandi, n. s. 



l. Cinereous fuscous. The markings on the primaries are 

 obliterate. The ordinary spots can be made out, of a paler gray, 

 the reniform very large, obsoletely black ringed. The t. p. line 

 may be seen as an approximate gray sinuate band in some indi- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 199 



vidiials. The blackish, brokenly dentate subterminal line, jDre- 

 ceded b}^ a gray shade, is usually observable and sti'ikes the e3'e. 

 Below vein 2 there is a stronger blackish accentuation or small 

 dash. Fringes concolorous. Hind wings with soiled veins and 

 Avhitish fringes, pale, transparent, ashen, with darker broken ter- 

 minal line. Beneath the primaries are fuscous ashen ; hind wings 

 whitish, irrorate, with discal mark and traces of an a[)proximate 

 median band.

 Bianthoecia pensilis, n. s. 



'J, 9. A bright gray, moderately sized species, shaded with 

 blackish, with a certain resemblance to 3Iamestra dislincta. 

 Primaries whitish at base, with a black basal longitudinal streak. 

 Median lines geminate, pale gray, approximate below median 

 vein. Claviform deep black, acute, extending to median shade, 

 apparently resting on a very fine black line which crosses the 

 median space. A very obvious bright brown shade extends 

 above it, l)elow the median vein, from the t. a. line downwardly 

 below vein 2 to the t. p. line. A similar but fainter shade stains 

 the discal field beyond the reniform spot. Orbicular narrow, 

 whitish, oblique, with an interior streak. Reniform pale, upright, 

 moderate, with an incomplete interior black annulus. T. p. line 

 lunulate, projected straightly outwardl}- along costal I'egion, 

 thence obliquely doAvnwardly to submedian fold, where it forms 

 a weak angulation to internal margin. A whitish shade below 

 vein 2 on subterminal space setting off the lower black cuneiform 

 marks of the s. t. line b}' contrast. The s. t. line is preceded by 

 a series of such marks, increasing in size; on costal region the 

 line appears as a white curve. A dark terminal line ; fringes pale 

 at base, fuscous outwardly. Hind wings pale fuscous, with soiled 

 veins and traces of double transverse lines. Beneath pale gray, 

 irrorate, with a common line accented on the veins and faint 

 discal points. Thorax and head mixed blackish and gray ; collar 

 with a median black curved line. Abdomen tufted on the dorsum ; 

 ovipositor exserted ; eyes hairy ; tibise unarmed.

Helotropha reniformis Grote, var. atra. 



I have received from Mr. Geo. Norman, under the number 172, 

 a singular variety of this species taken at St. Catherine's, Ont., 

 August tlie 12th, The specimen is a female. The fore wings 

 are entirely of a dead black, so that the markings become incon- 

 spicuous, and can onlj"^ be made out with difficult}'. The reniform 

 is, however, entirely white, and becomes very prominent by con- 

 trast. The hind wings are more blackish than brownish-fuscous, 

 as is the under surface and the body. 



Gortyna cerina, n. s. 



9. A large species with the colors of Xanthia .szVagro, but a very 

 much larger insect. I refer it to Gort^-na H'ubner=Hydi'oecia^ B., 

 Led., from the circumstance that the thorax is crested behind. 

 There is a sharp tuft behind the collar. Briglit yellow marked with 

 dull reddish-purple. Head and thorax yellow, with the patagia 

 and crestings shaded with reddish-purple. Fore wings widening 

 outwardl}', with sharp apices and rounded external margin, of an 

 intense yellow ; the terminal and sub-terminal spaces reddish-pur- 

 ple, separated by the narrow yellow sub-terminal line proceeding 

 from a 3'ellow apical shade spot. The base of the wing is shaded 

 with reddish-purple. The markings are fragmentarj'- ; the orbi- 

 cular small; the reniform large, narrow, diffusely annulated with 

 purplish in broken blotches. The median shade is as apparent as 

 the median lines, all somewhat ocherous, incomplete ; the t. p. 

 line scalloped. Hind wings soiled yellowish-white, a little darker 

 tinted outwardl}'. Abdomen like hind wings. Beneath like hind 

 wings above, with an obsolete median shade on secondaries ; on 

 the fore wings the darker tintings of the upper surface are partly 

 reflected terminally. 



Expanse 47 mm. Habitat. Kansas (Prof. Snow, No. 258). 



The head seems to me more sunken than in Xanthia, to which 

 the superb species might be referred at first sight from the color- 

 ing. 

 Himella, n. g. 



The t3'pe of this genus, H.Jidelis, is characterized by a resem- 

 blance to the species of Caradma, while diflering structurally by 

 the hair}' ej'cs. The % antenme are brush-like. The palpi have the 

 terminal article a little dependent. The tibi?e are unarmed; the 

 body parts linear and slender ; thorax untufted, hairy. The wings

are loug, widening a little outwardly with slightly rounded, nearly 

 straight external margin. The tj'pe has a casual resemblance to 

 the species of Ipimorpha. 



Himella fidelis, n. s. 



S . Of a peculiar, soft warm gra^-ish fuscous, the fore wings con- 

 colorous. The basal half line is indicated by black dots. Median 

 lines pale, even, shaded with blackish, approximate below the 

 median vein. Ordinai-y spots very large, a little paler than the 

 median space, rounded, very finely pale-circled, the reniform not 

 excavate. T. p. line a little waved or uneven, pale, with a narrow 

 preceding ochrej-brown shade line, a little depressed on costa. A 

 very fine pale terminal line, fringes concolorous. Hind wings with 

 white fringes and whitish at base, else largely fuscous ; beneath 

 whitish, irrorate with fuscous, and with a discal dot, and faint 

 median shade. Thorax and head concolorous with fore wings. 

 Palpi black at the sides.

 more like Orthodes. Fore wings pale ochrey fuscous. Ordinary 

 lines geminate, blackish. T. a. line thrice dentatedly waved, 

 minutely denticulate on costa. Ordinary spots small, inconspicu- 

 ous, obsoletel}- outlined, the reniform darker than the wing, attenu- 

 ate, black stained inferiorly. T. p. line denticulate, broken up into 

 black points on the veins. Sub-terminal line pale, well removed 

 towards the margin, preceded by an inconspicuous series of darker 

 points. A tei-minal series of interspaced black dots. Costal edge 

 dotted. Hind wings very pale, immaculate. Beneath xQvy pale ; 

 sparsely irrorate ; both wings show a distinct terminal series of 

 black dots ; thei'e is a common median line and on the hind wings 

 a moderate discal mark. Palpi inconspicuously blackish out-

A dark species with silky wings, resembling an Orthodes. 



Agrotis innotabilis, n. s. 



This well-marked species resembles, at first sight, A. hicarnea 

 and A. c. nigr-um from the Atlantic States, but differs by its 

 smaller size, and the absence of any carneous costal shade's on the 

 fore wings. Blackish ; the collar is pale at base, and very broadly 

 banded with deep black superiorly. Fore wings with the trans- 

 verse lines narrow, continued, geminate, accompanied by narrow, 

 pale shades. Orbicular small, spherical, lying in a deep black 

 discal shade preceding and following it ; reniform moderate, dis- 

 colorous, ochraceous, distinct, of the usual shape with distinct 

 internal ring ; fringes blackish. Hind Avings blackish fuscous, 

 paler at base. Beneath paler with a i)urpl3'' tinge ; a faint, narrow 

 common line, a little irregular on secondaries, and discal dots.

 black near the socket. Primaries whitish-gray, with the costal 

 edge tinged with carneous. The transverse lines are more broadly 

 marked in black on the costal region, below which they are indis- 

 tinct. The lunulate median shade is tinged with ferruginous or 

 ochre below the reniform. Ordinary spots large, concolorous, 

 black ringed, with black internal marking, lying in a blackish-

 beneath show the costal edge carneous, otherwise like secondaries, 

 without any apparent line. The thick body squamation beneath 

 has a carneous or rosy tinge.

 The lines and spots on the fore wings are indistinct, the fuscous 

 lines geminate, component lines rather widely separate. Orbicular 

 obsolete ; reiiiform vaguely outlined, touched bj' the angulation 

 of the median shade which is more distinct than the lines, and 

 angulated below the spot. T. p. line with its inner component

 erroneously credited him with the species instead of Mr. Thaxter 

 in my original description (Bull. Buff. Soc. N. S., 2, p. 75). I

Dark brown with a more or less decided ruddy tinge. Primaries 

 shaded with ochreous along internal margin, and with a well-sized 

 distinct deeper ochreous apical patch. Ordinary lines obsolete, 

 whitish, broken by black points on the veins ; the t. p. line ema- 

 nates from a distinct and large white spot on the Costa above the 

 vague reniform, which latter is preceded hy a distinct black shade 

 on the disk, an evident feature of the ornamentation of the wing. 

 Hind wings uniform pale fuscous, silky ; beneath as above with a

 collar dark brown. Tegulae and thoracic disk smooth pale fawn 

 color, and this lighter tinting spreads over the fore wings at base, 

 and extends, obliquely upwardly, to be3'ond the t. a. line over the 

 costal region to the median shade. Median lines geminate ; t. a. 

 line forming wide dentations ; t. p. line white shaded, emanating 

 from a double white costal mark, angulate opposite the cell, nearly 

 perpendicular, a little inwardly bent at median vein, skirting the 

 pale and small reniform spot which latter shows a dark central 

 line. The wing is darker, blackish shaded within the t. a. line at 

 the edge of the oblique pale basal shade, and on the disk. A lai'ge

Apamea Ochsenheimer (1816). 



This genus is established in the Schmetterlinge von Europa, 4, 

 p. 75, and divided into three "families" or groups: "A," with 

 nictitans^ etc.; " B," with fu7-uncula, etc. ; " C," with testacea, etc. 

 Hiibner next proposes distinct' genera which sufficiently corre- 

 spond to Ochsenheimer's three groups viz., Sideridis for the gvonp 

 "A," Oligia for the group "B," and Exarnes and Ogygia for 

 group " C." For some one of these genera the original term 

 Apamea has to be restored. 



Boisduval, in 1829, divides ^pawiea Ochs.into two genera; retain- 

 ing Apamea for a group of species headed by ?? zc<z7a?is, which em- 

 braces species included under all three of Ochsenheimer's divisions, 

 and proposing Luperina for testacea, and allied forms. This latter 

 genus is styled '■'■Ajjamea" by Lederer, in whose work an exposi- 

 tion of generic character is the strongest feature. Lederer's genus 

 " ivi/perina," contains none of Boisduval's species, and cannot 

 remain. It must be resolved into Liiceria, v. Hein., with the type 

 vi7-eni^^ and Ledereria with the group " B." For Lederer's 

 '■^Apamea^' the term Liqier-ina, Boisd. (with the type testacea)^ must 

 be retained. 



Two generic types nictitans and leucostigma are included in 

 Boisduval's genus Apamea ; the other species seem to be now con- 

 sidered as Hadenas s. g. Oligia. The original type of Gortyna, 

 Hiibner (Tentamen) is referred by Guenee to the genus Hydroecia, 

 Guen. I have restored Hiibner's original application in the " List 

 of the Noctuidaj of North America." In my work I have not 

 arbitrarily chosen the type of any genus, but have endeavored to 

 apply the rules of zoological nomenclature throughout. In our 

 researches after the true type of Apamea we must choose between 

 these two species, nictitans and leucostigma^ both contained in 

 Ochsenheimer's family "A," in the order cited, and both con- 

 tained in oisduval's restriction of that term. For the first spe- 

 cies we have Hiibner's term Sideridis to consider. Giving the 

 priority to Ap)amea in the first instance, I think we must consider 

 all of Hiibner's genera erected at the expense of this term, and 




206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



without its recognition for any of the species, us standing on an 

 equal footing. We are not encumbered in this matter by any con- 

 sideration of Guenee's term Hi/drcecia, for his indication of the 

 t3^pe makes it synonymous with Gortyna, Hiibner. To many of 

 Hiibner's genera, e. g. Agrotis^ continental authors cite Treitschke 

 or Ochsenheimer from prejudice or tradition. Here, in the United 

 States, we should be free from either sentiment. I see nothing in 

 all this embroiled sjnionymy to prevent m}^ proposing to fix the 

 type of Apaviea on victitans, in rectification of my undoubted 

 error on page 18 of m}^ '' List," where I overlooked Guenee's dis- 

 tinct indication of micacea as the type of his genus Hydroccia.. In 

 Ochsenheimer's mind nictitans was evidently the type of his genus 

 Apamea^ and the term was evidently intended for the smaller 

 white-flecked species allied to Go7'tijna. For Lederer's genus 

 '•'' Hydroecia^''^ in its integrity, the term Gortyna should undoubtedly 

 be used, as I have before shown. I think I am warranted in divid- 

 ing it into two genera: Apamea, Ochs., with the type nictitans^ 

 and Gortyna,, Hiibner, with the type micacea indicated by Hiibner 

 in his Tentamen (180G). Our North American species of Apamea 

 are as follows: — 



1. Ap. nictitans (Linn.). 



var. erythrostigma (Haw.). 



2. Ap. sera (G. k R.). 



3. Ap. inqusesita (G. & R.). 



4. Ap. purpuripennis, Grote. 



5. Ap. semiaperta (Morr.). 



I have already referred the Hydrcecia lorea, of Guenee, which has 

 hairy eyes, to Mameslra in the "List of the Noctuidte of North 

 America." 



As yet I have seen only the var. erythrostigma (Haw.) of A. nic- 

 titans from California; the t^'pical form doubtless occurs there. 

 The specimens were large and highly colored. 



Apamea purpuripennis, n. s. 



9. Allied to H. semiaper^ta, Morr., slighter, of a more rich pur-

 median lines more approximate than in its ally. The median 

 space, centrall}^, is largely stained of an intenser hue than the 

 rest of the wing. In this deeper shading is placed the white re-

 Pseudorthosia pectinata, n. s. 



% . The tibiae are all spinose. The species differs from the 

 Californian P. variabilis in the longer pectinations of the anten- 

 nfB. The color is probably variable as in the Californian form. 

 In the specimen it is ochre^'-brown, somewhat olivaceous ; all the 

 lines are obsolete. The reniform is merelj' indicated by a vague 

 clouding. The subterminal line is preceded on costa by a deeper 

 tinting. Hind wings blackish fuscous without lines. Beneath 

 quite pale, with a brighter dusting of scales, without markings, 

 except a lunulate discal mark on the fore wings. Thorax like 

 primaries above.

 Pseudorthosia variabilis, Grote. 



Mr. Behrens has taken a number of specimens at Saucelito dur- 

 ing September, Avhich vary from olivaceous through orange-brown 

 to pale in color. The species may always be recognized by the 

 median shade, and the configuration of the stigmata. 



Plusia labrosa, n. s. 



-^ . A lovely species, larger than P.pasiphseia Grote, and differ- 

 ing in color and the shape of the metallic mark. Rosy purple, 

 shaded with olivaceous brown on the median space below the 

 nervnre, before the subterminal line, and on terminal space at the 

 extremities of veins 2 to 4, and again at apices. Median lines 

 narrow, pale, stained with ochreous. Reniform narrow, 8-shaped. 

 Metallic mark bold, yellow white, not divided, extending out- 

 wardly nearly to the t. p. line, resembling that of Precationis, to 

 wliich this handsomer species is allied. Subterminal line distinct, 

 deepl}^ angulated, forming two broad teeth between veins 2 and 4, 

 beyond which the terminal space shows three olivaceous shades. 

 Hind wings fuscous, with broad blackish borders. Head and 

 thorax rosy purple, shaded with olivaceous brown on the collar

Plusia epigaea, n. s. , 



Allied to P. ampla Walk.^ but with differently colored fore wings 

 and with the attenuate discal mark outwardly produced inferiorly. 

 Fore wings slatey or silky lilac-gray, watered in appearance from 

 the character of the transverse darker sliades. The discal spot is 

 open, with the two limbs very narrow, inclosing a trigonate space 

 below the median vein of the ground-color of the wing, and with 

 its inferior portion directed outwardly more boldly in the shape of 

 the tail of a T., terminating roiuidedly. The spot surmounts a 

 deep brown shade stretching across the median space, but not 

 extending to internal margin, with a bright red stain where it 

 reaches the t. p. line. Reniform partially black ringed, oblique, 

 touched by the black median shade line which is apparent on the 

 costal region. T. a. line oblique, angulate, much as in P. ampla. 

 Orbicular small, apparently open to costa. Thorax colored like 

 fore wings, with elevated central crest, the outer face of which is 

 deep brown, discolorous. Hind wings, testaceous fuscous, with 

 darker borders, and pale fringes dotted interspaceally with fus- 

 cous. Beneath fuscous, the usual markings obliterate.

I am indebted to Doctor Hagen for the communication of this 

 description. Since a second American motli is described in the

same work as coming from New York, from the same person, it is 



possible that the specimen above described came from the same 



locality. The second species is apparently a Geometrid, and called 



Phal. Geom. extenaria. It is barely- possible that Linne intended 



our common Pliisia simplex by his description of Phalaena Omi- 



cron. 



Scopelosoma devia, n. s. 



% . Tlie new species resembles S. Morrisoni in that the primaries 

 are crossed by pale shade lines, but it differs from all the species 

 in their course. The color is dark olivaceous fuscous, darker 

 than S. Walkeri ; and the lines are accompanied b^' an olive shad- 

 ing. The median lines are even, and nearer together, especially 

 on the costa, than in the other species. The t. a. line is even, and 

 runs inwardly obliquely from the costa to internal margin. The 

 t. p. line is nearly straight, a little flexed, not roundedly exserted 

 opposite the cell. The concolovous reniform is annulate, upright, 

 pale ringed, not constricted, narrow, slightl}^ luniform. The pale 

 subterminal line is preceded first bj- an olive shading, and secondly 

 hy an even, distinct, pale shade, which is wanting in the other 

 species; hind vtings dark fuscous; bod}' parts concolorous. 

 Beneatli the wings are a little paler, fuscous, subirrorate, with a 

 common blackish median shade line and discal marks. 



Expanse 32 mm. Habitat. St. Catherine's (Mr. George Norman, 

 No. 12). 



Although it is sufficiently apparent that the si)ecies of Scopelo- 

 soma are variable, and that we cannot rel}' on the ground-color 

 of the primaries for specific character, I believe we shall have to 

 discriminate three species at least of the group of vinulenta. I 

 am now inclined to reconsider my identification of sidus Guenee, 

 whose indefinite description is not of much use where we have to 

 descriminate between several species. 



I think it now more probable that Guenee has described vinu- 

 lenta as sidus, and that " sidus" Grote, will prove a form of S. 

 Walkeri Grote, in which the primaries are stained of a light 

 reddish, and the spots are variable as in the deep-colored S. vinu- 

 lenta. S. Morrisoni varies in the tint of the primaries in a cor- 

 responding fashion. We should then have the following species: —

The Intter species one might be tempted to refer to Glsea or 

 Xanthia^ but the elongate dentate primaries would determine its 

 generic position. 



Calocampa cineritia, n. s. 



Distinguishable from C. curvimaciila, Morr., and C. mipera^ 

 Lintn., by the absence of any basal dashes on the primaries. 

 Fore wings bathed in ashen from the base to the blackish fringes, 

 allowing an ochreous shade to extend outwardly beyond the reni- 

 form over the snbterminal line, the latter here more distinctly 

 marked by uneven cuneiform dashes. The black ringed ordinary 

 spots are so close as to nearly coalesce ; they are wider apart in 

 C. curvimacula. The costal region is shaded with deep brown ; 

 the extreme base of the wing is whitish; the t. a. line is visible, 

 strongly dentate, geminate; the costal edge is black; the thorax 

 is black, as in the European species, not broM'ii as in Curvimacula; 

 the sides at the base of the primaries are white; the collar is pale 

 brown, finely lined ; the front and palpi blackish; hind wings con- 

 colorous, rudd}' fuscous ; beneath ruddy fuscons with dentate 

 median line and discal point on hind wings. 



Expanse 50 mm. Hahitat. Newtonville, Mass. (Mr. R. Thaxter, 

 No. 44. May 19th). 



This species resembles G. velusta perhaps more than G. nupera 

 does, and might stand for its American "representative." I have, 

 following Mr. Morrison's remarks, been disposed to consider G. 

 nupera as the American '' representative" of the European G. ve- 

 tuda (Bull. Buff. S. N. S., 2, p. 195). G. nupera appears to me 

 to resemble the European G. exolefa, rather than G. curoimacula^ 

 in opposition to Mr. Morrison's opinion on the subject. There 

 are no brown shades on the internal portion of the wing in C. cine- 

 ritia, nor is the terminal space ochraceous, except opposite the 

 disk, and as the continuation of the same shade opposite the 

 reniform. There are no superposed dots representing tiie orbicu- 

 lar as in C. vetuHta, from which G. cineritia seems to be easily 

 distinguishable by the configuration of the ordinary spots. Tlie 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 211 



three American species of Galocampa appear to me easily separa- 

 ble from the two European. The species had very probably' a 

 common tertiary origin, and the question of one species "repre- 

 senting" another has probably no proper basis in fact. At any 

 rate, we must agree with Mr. Lintner that tlie American C. nvpera 

 does not "represent" the European G. Uf?^a.s<a, and the comparison 

 between the species on page 195, of vol. ii. Bull. B. S. N. S., must 

 be omitted. 



The inquiry as to what species from America Mr. Walker has 

 regarded as the same as G. vetnsta, seems to me entirely barren. 

 The European species was included in the "List of N. Am. Noc- 

 tuidse" upon Mr. Walker's autliority, and whenever a European 

 species is cited in that list, it is understood to be on tlie authority 

 cited after the original description. Where no other than the 

 original description is given (as for instance Agrotis baga, p. 2) 

 the Author of the "List" assumes the respousibilit3^ 

 Pyrrhia illiterata, n. s. 



9. The moth agrees with Pyrrhia in the unarmed fore tibiae, 

 and the sharp tuft behind the collar. It differs greatly in the 

 appearance of the ordinary lines from our hitherto described spe- 

 cies exprimens and angulata. Entirely reddish orange, the collar 

 and tegulse faintly margined with fuscous. Primaries with the 

 transverse lines narrow, undulate, denticulate, the t. a. and t. p. 

 lines tending to be accented by interspaceal points. The lines are 

 fuscous or blackish, unaccompanied by au}'^ shades. Ordinary 

 spots like the lines, incompletely outlined, concolorous, the orbi- 

 cular spherical, moderate. Sub-terminal line indicated bv dots, 

 with a preceding dark costal sliade and a shade spot opposite the 

 cell. Hind wings stained with red, with a narrow fuscous subter- 

 minal shading, like that of Heliofhis, but less prominent. Beneath 

 with a common continued fuscous exterior line becoming obliterate 

 on the hind wings inferiorly. Discal marks on primaries, but none 

 on secondaries.

 however, fuller, and the habitus more that of the genus to Avhich I 

 have referred it. 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Tamila tertia, n- s. 



% 9 . At first sight the species recalls the genus Tarache 

 (Acontia), but the armature of the tibioe allies the moth to 

 Heliothis. It agrees with Tamila in the fact that the vestitui'e 

 of the thorax consists of flattened scales mixed with hair. The 

 fore tibiae have a double row of short spinules terminating in a 

 stout short blunt spine on the outside. White or with a yellow 

 brown tinge. Fore wings darlc at base, with the t. a. line black, 

 projected on median nervure, a little irregular. The anterior and 

 widest half of the median space beyond the line is nearly white or 

 pale to the median shade, showing the faintly marked orbicular. 

 Beyond the median shade the median space is shaded with oliva- 

 ceous fuscous, as is the rest of the wing except the rivulous white 

 subterminal shade ; the white usuall}- obtaining again before the 

 t. p. line. Reniform rather large, outlined outwardly in black, 

 suffused with a leaden hue. T. p. line sinuate, geminate, the outer 

 component line black, broken. A terminal black broken line pre- 

 ceded by pale shading. Fringes olivaceous fuscous, the extremi- 

 ties pale and dark dotted. Hind wings whitish with a subterminal 

 fuscous shade and discal mark. Beneath white, with a large black 

 discal mark on primaries, and a subterminal transverse fuscous 

 shade furcate superiorly. Hind wings with a faint discal lunule 

 and terminal shading. Body parts white or pale, the black 

 ovipositor shortly exserted.

A dai'ker tinted, less whitish specimen has been sent me by Mr. 

 E. L. Graef from Texas. The dark color is less olivaceous than 

 in T. nundina, from which the species is separable by the dis- 

 tinctly marked median lines. 

 Pseudolimacodes niveicostatus, Grote. 



In my original description of this genus and species (Stett. Ent. 

 Zeitung), I referred it to the NonfasciatJB, but on account of the 

 projecting head, stout and prominent labial palpi, and in particular 

 the pattern of the ornamentation, I believe we must place it 

 among the Fasciatse of Borkhausen. The neuration has not been 

 studied. It differs from all the genera known to me in this latter 

 group by the proportionally short, stout, and distinctly brush-like 

 antennae. The obliquity of the line beneath on the hind wings is 

 indicative of its aflinities. The lines on the primaries above are 

 like Phurys somewhat in position. The colors are intense rosy 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 213 



silk3' brown, and in this respect tlie concolorons species recalls 

 PanojJoda, Pleonectyj^fera, and otlier bright-hued quadrifid 

 genera. The costa is white to the inception of the outer trans- 

 verse line. The inner line is outwardly rounded, oblique ; 

 ai)proaching the straighter outer line on internal margin. The 

 two lines are dark with pale rosy shadings. A white transverse 

 streak in the place of the reniform. No other markings on the 

 wing. The hind wings are faintly crossed bj^ a diagonal streak. 

 A Z specimen has been sent me from Massachusetts for identifi- 

 cation by Mr. Morrison expanding 28 mm. 



Homopyralis, n. g. 



This genus appears intermediate between the genera allied to 

 Homoptera and the Deltoids. The e^'cs are naked, ocelli very 

 small. The male antennae are lengthily pubescent beneath with a 

 longer bristle on each side of each antennal joint; in the female 

 the pubescence is absent, and the lateral bristles somewhat shorter. 

 The palpi are long and exceed the front, curved, with elongate 

 third article, closely scaled. The thoracic squaraation consists of 

 flattened scales with rounded, even apices, those attached to the 

 prothorax very broad ; there is a very slight admixture of hair. 

 The size is small, the body slender, the wings broad with 

 Homopteriform ornamentation, the tibise unarmed. 



Homopyralis tactus, n. s. 



% 9. Dark brown, concolorous Transverse lines black shaded. 

 Orbicular a small black dot; reniform a larger black subluniform 

 spot touched by the double median shade which forms the most 

 noticeable feature of the wing, and is repeated on the secondaries 

 where it includes the black discal spot. The t. p. line is geminate, 

 marked on costa, sometimes merely indicated by dotted fragments 

 opposite the cell, where it is somewhat rectangularly exserted, 

 running inwardly below median vein, and approximating to the 

 median shade on internal margin. Costal, pale, ante-apical dots, 

 below which the costal region is darker shaded before the faint 

 subterminal line. A terminal interspaceal series of dots; fringes 

 concolorous. On the hind wings transverse rivulous shades with- 

 out the black median shade; on internal margin these are relieved 

 by a pale yellowish staining. Beneath pale, with common trans- 

 verse shades, imitating the upper surface, and with a resemblance 

 to the wider surface of the wings in Pseudaglossa.

Anthers of Ambrosia artemisiaefolia. — Mr. Meehan desired to 

 correct an error into which he had fallen, in some observations on 

 the Ambrosia artemisirefolia, contributed to the Academy's Pro- 

 ceedings a few years ago. Among other things, he stated in that 

 paper that there were two classes of anthers in the flowers, one 

 barren, and surmounted b}^ a short horn, the other poUeniferous, 

 and hornless. He had been led to re-examine the matter through 

 the kindness of Professor Asa Gray, who had written to liim, after 

 his remarks had been quoted in Hooker and Bentham's Genera 

 Flantarnm, expressing doubts as to the accurac}' of the observ- 

 ation. He now found he was wrong. There is but one class of 

 stamens, and all have horns. He expressed regret for the error, 

 believing inaccurate observations the bane of science. He would 

 only say in extenuation that the error was one easily made. 

 The parts are exceedingly small, requiring a strong glass to see 

 them. The small horn is bent down closely against the back of 

 the stamen^ and does not become erect until the pollen has been 

 discharged. He thus had concluded it did not exist. Then the 

 pollen must be ejected in some way very rapidly after the pollen 

 sacs have burst, and the dry membranous remains so freel}' mixed 

 with what appeared perfect authers had misled him. The burst- 

 ing and emptying b}^ the sacs of their pollen, and the erection of 

 the horn, he thought must take place suddenl}^ and early in tlie 

 morning, as he had found no change whatever in the various parts 

 of the inflorescence after 9 A. M. He had hoped to be able to 

 give the exact time and manner of these actions, but the approach 

 of winter had desti'oyed the specimens, and he was unwilling to 

 let the season go over without correcting the error in the particu- 

 lars named. 



Dimorphism in Apj^les. — Mr. Thomas Meehan said that of late 

 years it had been an interesting question what influence was 

 exerted on the character of the fruit immediately by hybridiza- 

 tion. He had himself brought to the notice of the Academy, in- 

 stances which proved in some cases there was an immediate influ- 

 ence, as well as on the progeny of the fertilized fruit. But he 

 believed there was more claimed for this immediate influence than 

 the facts warranted. In the apple there had been many instances 

 in scientific journals of the highest character, in which it was 

 believed that two distinct fruits had combined in one apple by 




21G PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



hyliridization. The chief mixtures were generally russets with 

 ligliter api)les. He exliibited one which had been sent bj' Mr. J. 

 J. Thomas, of Union Springs, in which the npper half was russet 

 and the lower of some gi'een kind. In this case, however, it was 

 clear that the russet was formed bj^ some element of destruc- 

 tion in the epidermal cells. In the bark of most trees suber 

 cells had in each tree a specific form of development, and were 

 generally very uniform in their conditions of growth. They 

 usually destroyed the bark as they grew, and generallj^ in some 

 one regular direction, and this gave the characteristic fissures 

 to the bark of trees, and not mere mechanical expansion, as 

 was popularly supposed. It was not always regular, however, as 

 in the plane tree it was erratic, and thus the bark peeled off with- 

 out any regular plan, and in the most unexpected places. The 

 skin of the apple was but modified bark, and in the epidermis were 

 cells subject to the same laws of development' as in bark. In 

 the beech only a very thin film was subjected to the destructive 

 agency of the suber cells, changing the color of the young green 

 shoots to an ashen-gray in age, without an}' deep rifts ever appear- 

 ing. In the apple, both in the bark and fruit, the cells proceeded 

 in much the same wa}', erratic sometimes as in the beech, and 

 acting on the thin external membrane as in the beech or plane. 

 The russet appearance followed this action in the apple and pear. 

 Very often it appeared near the stem cavity. Frequently on the 

 same tree there would he large numbers russetted in this way, as 

 well as man}' witiiout. The variable nature of the russet growth 

 was more frequently seen in the pear than in the apple. He had 

 seen in these kinds in some seasons and places all yellow, the half 

 or more covered with russet in others. 



He had never seen the peculiar condition of the parts exhibited 

 in Mr. Thomas's specimen before, but it was evident that all the 

 phenomena pointed to some similar external cause, and that cross 

 fertilization had nothing to do with these dimorphic cases. 



Mr. M. also exhibited another specimen similar to the one pro- 

 duced last year, from the tree at Kittaning, Pa., which bore fruit, 

 without- the production of calyx, corolla, or stamens. Tiie upper 

 portions of the series of the embryonic leaves which form the fruit, 

 were more free than in that exhibited last 3'ear, affording a better 

 illustration of the morphology of the parts. 



Blindness of Salmon Dr. A. G. Reed made the following 



remarks regarding the cause of blindness of the salmon: In the 

 month of August, 1873, I ascended the Tobique River, of New 

 Brunswick, to its head-waters, for the purpose of salmon fishing, 

 and thence descended the Nipisiquit River, where I found the best 

 salmon fishing in the province. 



While on the Tobique River my Indian guide captured a large 

 salmon so easily that it attracted my attention, when he told me 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 217 



it was a blind salmon ; and upon examination, I found this fish 

 had various scars on liis head, the left eye had sloughed out, 

 the right e^-e had a cut across it, and a thin film had formed over 

 the eye, causing him to be entirely blind. I learned from the 

 Indians that it often occurred that large salmon became blind, and 

 did not return to the sea with the rest of the fish for feeding, but 

 remained in the deep pools of the river, and eventually starved to 

 death. The Indians have many theories regarding tiie cause of this 

 blindness, none of which are plausible. During this trip I had 

 several chances of seeing salmon that were either blind in one or 

 both eyes, but did not at that time find out the true cause. But 

 duriug the past summer, while fishing on the tributaries of the 

 Saguinay River, in Canada, I again saw the same disease present- 

 ing itself in the salmon of those streams. I noticed that no small 

 salmon are found in this condition, and that all the blind ones 

 have cuts across the eyes and head, producing scars as if some line 

 or thread had been drawn tightlj' across the e\'ebali. 



My view of the matter is that the fish in ascending or descend- 

 ing the streams come in contact with gill-nets that are set for the 

 cai)ture of this fine fish for food, which the inhabitants of that 

 region use during their long cold winters. The meshes of the nets 

 are of the proper size to allow a large salmon to pass his head 

 through as far as the eye, while the smaller fish pass the head fur- 

 ther through, and thus escape the cut of the fine linen thread across 

 the delicate membranes of the e3'e. 



This cut if deep produces sloughing, but if slight, inflammation 

 and infiltration of the conjunctiva, thereby rendering it opaque. 



It is onl}^ the large noble fellows that escape capture by these 

 nets, with their heads scarred and their tails slit, showing the fear- 

 ful struggle they had in clearing themselves of the nets spread for 

 their capture, and living to become blind — never again to return 

 to their feeding grounds, and soon to die of starvation.

On Specijic Gravity. — Prof. Letdy remarked, that, in taking the 

 specific gravity of minerals by means of the scales in weighing the 

 substance in water, the usual plan was to suspend it from one side 

 of the instrument by a delicate thread or hair. The attachment 



of the specimen was tedious 

 I and often difficult, especially 



in the case of small crystals 

 and polished gems, from 

 which the hair would slip, 

 and could only be made to 

 retain its position by caus- 

 ing it to stick with some ad- 

 hesive matter. He dispensed 

 with the thread or hair, and 

 substituted on one side of 

 the balance a double dish, 

 as represented in the figure. 

 The lower dish is perforated, and is kept suspended in a glass of 

 water. After weighing the specimen in air in the upper dish, it 

 is simply necessary to change its place to the lower dish to weigh 

 it in water. 



Coloring of Autumn Leaves. — Mr. Thomas Meehan presented 

 some leaves sent to the Academy from the West, illustrating the 

 influence of light in coloring autumn leaves. They were of the 

 red or swamp maple, Acer ruhrum., and had been fastened in pairs 

 by a spider's web. The uppermost leaf, obstructing the sun's 

 action on a portion of the lower, had prevented any change of 

 color in the unexposed part of the lower leaf, and thus the exact 

 form of the upper was photographed or outlined on the lower one. 

 Mr. Meehan said there was nothing new to science in this observa- 

 tion, as orchardists were well aware that the coloring of apples 

 and pears was deepest on the sunny side ; and that when entirely 

 shaded from the sun, by over-hanging leaves or branches, they 

 were almost colorless. 



This fact was often taken advantage of to photograph names 

 by stencilled paper on fruits. At the Great Sanitary Fair held 

 during the war, fruit with names of Grant and Lincoln thus " sun 

 burnt" on them, brought good prices. 



Still it was well to remember that the sun could not be the sole 

 cause of color. Apples exposed to the same sunlight would be 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 219 



often striped, and the dark colors would often be of A^arious shades. 

 Besides this, European trees which had no color in their own 

 country, when planted side by side with allied species here, still 

 preserved the same characteristics. Neitlier heat, nor light, nor 

 frost made the slightest change. The English oak beside the 

 closely allied American white oak retained its green color till 

 absolutely dried up by frosty winds. On the other hand, our 

 colored-leaved trees preserved their same colored characteristics 

 when growing in Europe under very dissimilar circumstances to 

 those at home. 



In spite of the visible action of the siui in the instances exhibited 

 and quoted, it was clear from the facts referred to, that solar or 

 chemical action could not be the sole cause of autumn colored 

 foliage. Though it seemed an incipient stage of decay, involving 

 chemical change, the coloring of the apple in the sunlight, or of 

 the autumn leaf, ceased if taken from its parent tree. It had to 

 remain on to the last, to get its full tints. Vital action of some 

 sort, therefore, must be taken into account by those who are 

 investigating the subject. 



The Committee to which it had been referred recommended the 

 following paper to be published : —

 shoulder. Length, 4. .50. Wing, 2.50. Tail, 2. Measurements 

 from mounted bird. 



The bird from which the above description is taken I obtained 

 from my friend, Mr. D. B. Dickinson, of Chatham, New Jersey, in 

 whose collection I found it. Its capture, as nearly as I can 

 ascertain, was in Ma}^, 1874, on the bank of the Passaic, near 

 Chatham. The specimen is evidently an adult male, and is so 

 clearly and strikingl}^ marked as to preclude the possibility of its 

 being an unusual form of Pinus or Chrysoptera, its nearest allies, 

 or a hybrid. Its general appearance is at first like Pinus with the 

 black eye and throat patches of Chrysoptera, but a closer exami- 

 nation shows little peculiarities that do not exist in either. Of 

 its title to a place in our Helminthophagas there can be no doubt, 

 and I take greater pleasure in recording it, because of its capture in 

 New Jersey, a section already so thoroughly worked up. For a 

 name, I think none can be so appropriate as that of my esteemed 

 friend, George N. Lawrence, Esq., in recognition of many favors 

 in the past, and of his untiring labors towards the promotion of 

 ornithology.

Continuous Groivth in Fungoidal Excrescences. — Mr. Thomas 

 Meehan exhibited some excrescences, growing on brandies of 

 Que7^cus tinctoria., the black oak, gathered from above tlie remarka- 

 ble quarry of broken rocks at Edge Hill, which liad been brought 

 to the notice of the Academy last year by Mr. Rand, and remarked 

 that all familiar with our forest features must have often seen 

 similar excrescences, which were the work of insects, and partook 

 of the nature of galls. An examination of these exhibited showed 

 them to be of fungoid oi'igin, and similar in their nature to the 

 familiar knots on the plum and cherry, which through the re- 

 searches of the late Mr. Walsh and Prof. Peck, of Albany, were 

 now known to be of fungoid, and not of insect origin. These, 

 however, and he believed most of the excrescences of this character, 

 completed their growth within one year, becoming dead and dry 

 the subsequent season. Sometimes new matter would form near 

 the point of issue of the old one; but this was wholly from the 

 branches, and added nothing to the growth of the former year. 

 In the case of these Edge Hill specimens, the growth of the 

 excrescence was as regularly continuous as the other Avoody 

 portions of the tree, and seemed to endure while the tree lasted. 

 The first season the excrescences were small, the second as large 

 as marbles, and the third often equalled a w^alnut in size, while 

 some on the trunks and main branches were as large as an average 

 sized oyster-shell. The minute fungoid organisms that formed 

 these excrescences were usually short-lived ; and their longevity 

 in these instances he considered remarkable. 



On a Neio Mastodon and Rodent. — Prof. Cope made a commu- 

 nication on the Elephants obtained by himself in New Mexico and 

 Colorado during the past season while attached to the Wheeler 

 Survey. He had obtained Ulcphas primigenius var. Golumbi from 

 post-pliocene beds at the base of the Zandia mountains, and the 

 Mastodon ohioticus from coi'responding beds near Taos. The 

 former species he had also obtained from the valley of the South 

 Platte in northeastern Colorado. The pliocene sands of Santa F^ 

 contained numerous remains of a Mastodon which Leidj' had re- 

 ferred to his 31. ohscurus^^ but which is obviousl}^ a different species, 

 and being without name. Prof. Coi)e proposed to call it M. produc- 



• Report of Geolog. Surv. Terrs., Vol. I. 4to., p. 235. 




222 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



tus. He gave a list of the North American Mastodons, veferring 

 them to the two groups characterized, the one by the continuous 

 cross-crests divided by a fissure only, the other by the transverse 

 series of two or more deeply separated tubercles. To the first 

 he referred 31. ohioticiis., Cuv., and 31. jn^oaims, Cope; to the second 

 M. chajymanii^ Hays (from which if. oh.^cu7nis could not be at 

 present distinguished), 31. shepaiYlii, Leidy; 31. aridiiim, D'Orb. 

 (the last two referred by Leidy to 31. obi^curus) ; 31. mirificus, 

 Leidy (closely allied to M. humboldfii), and 3L producfus, Cope. 



No question as to the distinctness of the 31. productua could 

 arise, although our knowledge of the 31. chapmanii to which it 

 has been referred is very slight. As described by Drs. Hays and 

 Leidy, the lateral tubercles of the molars in that species are 

 closely appressed or not separated, being sometimes continuous 

 across the crown of the tooth. This description applies to one 

 of the specimens (a cast) selected by Dr. Leidy as his type, and 

 to a second specimen referred by him to the 31. andium. The 

 second t3"pe specimen of Leid3', a fragment of a posterior molar, 

 is undistinguishable fi'om corresponding parts of 31. andium. The 

 31. shepardii as described by Leidy is evidently quite distinct from 

 both the preceding and from the 31. productui^, in the absence of 

 accessory tubercles of the lateral principal cusps of the molars. 

 The 31. p7-oductus was characterized as follow^s : — 

 Tlie ])osterior inferior molar supports five transverse series of 

 tubercles, of which the posterior is less developed than the others. 

 Each series is composed of two cusps of a conic form which are 

 separated deeply from each othei', and are not united at the base 

 so as to become confluent on attrition. The cones of the outer side 

 support one or two accessory tubercles on a line with their inner 

 or median face, so tliat the transverse section of a worn tooth with 

 the two accessory cusps is that of a trefoil witli the lobes inwards. 

 The penultimate molar in the same jaw supports three transverse 

 series. The symphysis is elongate depressed and subspatulate ; 

 its proximal half is excavated, the distal lialf flattened. Two 

 tusks project from the extremity ; they are short, obtuse, and 

 flattened on the inner side. Total length of a specimen wdiich is 

 entire from the end of tiie symphyseal tusks to just behind tlie 

 last molar, 29 inches; length to first molar (penultimate), 19 

 inches; lengtli of first molar, 4.25 inches; of last molar, G..^ inches; 

 width of same, 3 inches. Width across the rami at end of last 

 molar, 18 inches; do. between anterior borders of first molar, 2.5; 

 do. of symphyseal spout, least, 4.5 inches ; at base tusks, 4.75 

 inches. Length of free portion of symphyseal tusks, 4 inches ; 

 diameter of do. 1.75 inches. 



Prof. Cope also described a species of Rodent from the same 

 beds under the name of Steneojiber pam^iin. 



The molar teeth exhibit a regular gradation in width from the 

 large anterior to the small posterior. In the mandibular series 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELrHIA. 223 



the second and third are broader than long, the first and fourth 

 longer than broad, and with an angle on the outer anterior side 

 of the crown. There is an inflection or groove of the enamel on 

 both inner and outer sides of the crown, and one enamel area before 

 and one behind them on all excepting the last molar, where there 

 are two in front. First nearly twice as large as last molai'. Lower 

 incisor with smooth enamel, and angulate on the extero-anterior 

 border. Ramus stout. Length of molar series m. .OIG ; length 

 of first molar m. .005 ; width of first molar m. .004; width of last 

 molar m. .0035; transverse diameter of incisor m. .004; depth of 

 ramus at m. 2.012. 



The regular diminution of the size of the teeth from front to 

 rear is characteristic of tliis species; according to Dr. Leidy their 

 reduction in size in the S. vebrascensis is more abrupt. The latter 

 species is said to be of Miocene age.

Beina7'k\^ on Fossih presetited. — Prof Leidy remarked that the 

 collection of fossils presented this evening by Lieut. E. Crawford, 

 U.S.A., contained some interesting specimens. Among them 

 are a number of tertiaiy vertebrate remains, which were found bj^^ 

 Lieut. Crawford about ten miles from Red Cloud Agencj^, Ne- 

 braska. They mainly consist of fragments of bones and teeth, 

 similar to those which he had previously ascribed to Titanotherium. 

 The specimens indicate two individuals differing in size. 



A lower jaw fragment, contains a last molar, like those repre- 

 sented in Plate XVI. of the Ancient Fauna of Nebraska, except that 

 tlie external basal ridge is interrupted at the extreme outer part 

 of the lobes of tlie crown. The fore and aft diameter of the latter 

 has been about 3 inches and *7 lines. 'J he thickness of the jaw 

 just below^ the fore part of the tooth is little more than two inches. 



A number of lower molars exhibiting evidences of having 

 belonged together indicate a larger animal than the former. The 

 last molar has lost its hinder lobe, but without this is as large 

 fore and at't as in the specimen first indicated. When perfect, it 

 was about 4^ inches antero-posteriorl3\ In this likewise tlie basal 

 ridge is interrujited at tlie extreme outer part of the lobes of the 

 crown. The crown of the second molar, well-worn, is 35 lines 

 fore and aft. 



The three premolars have the same constitution as the molars, 

 and rapidly diuiinisli in size, passing forward in the series. The 

 first premolar is 14 lines fore and aft; the second is 19 lines; and 

 the third is 22 lines. 




224 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



The lower series of three premolars and three molars has 

 measured in its complete condition about 14 inches in length. 



The isolated canine tooth, which I suppose to have pertained to 

 the lower jaw, is a remarkable tooth, and has more of the usual 

 characters of an incisor tooth. The crown is short, conical, and 

 robust, and is bounded internally with a thick basal ridge. The 

 length of the crown in its present worn condition is 13 lines; its 

 width at base from without inwardlj', about the same measurement, 

 and from side to side 11 lines. 



Of several imperfect thoracic vertebrae, one of the best preserved 

 has the bod}' over 2 inches long at the lower margin and about 3^ 

 inches in breadth. The centre are strongly concavo-convex. 



The head of a thigh-lwne is about 4 inches in diameter, and has 

 a large deep pit on its inner side for a terete ligament. 



The distal end of a thigh-bone is 6 inches in transverse diameter, 

 and the trochlea for the patella is over 3 inches wide. 



Accompanying the Titanotherium remains are the shells of two 

 turtles pertaining to the species Sfylemys nehrascensis. 



The remaining fossils of the collection are mainly cretaceous, 

 and were obtained by Lieut. Crawford in various localities of 

 Dakota. Among tliem are several large specimens oi Inoceramus 

 prohlematicua in nodules of iron stone, and fragments o? Bacalites 

 compressus^ together with several vertebrie of fishes, etc. 



On the Characters of Symhorodon. — Prof. Cope stated that the 

 fossil mammalian remains from near the Red Cloud Agency, Da- 

 kota, presented this evening, probably Ijelonged to a species of 

 Symhorodon. He remarked that that genus differs from Titano- 

 therium (or Menodus) in the entire absence of inferior incisor teeth, 

 and the close approximation of the canines. In the last-named 

 genus the canine teetli of the lower jaw are widely separated b}' 

 four well-developed incisors. Dr. Leidy had included species of 

 Symbo7^odon in his descriptions of Titanotherium Proutii; thus 

 nearly or quite all of tiie portions of upper jaws described and 

 figured by him as belonging to the latter genus, really pertained 

 to the former, hence the erroneous assertion that Symhorodon and 

 Titanotherium are identical. The upper jaw and superior teeth, 

 with the possible exception of one or two molars, of Titanotherium 

 Proutii are unknown. He added that in a i'e.'^ days his figures of 

 corresponding parts of the lower jaws of the two genera would 

 appear (in Hayden's Report U. S. Geological Survey Terrs. 1873, 

 Plate II.) and render the point clear. 



On. Dr. Leidy^s ^'' Correction.''^ — Prof. Cope stated that his record 

 of Dr. Leidy's views on the Fossil Reptilia of the Upper Missouri 

 Lignite, contained in Hayden's Bulletin, LT. S. Geological Survey 

 Territories, No. 2, p. T, which Dr. Leidy had deemed inaccurate,' 

 expressed, as nearly as the case would admit of, the conclusions to 



' Proceedings of the Academy, 1874, p. 73. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 225 



be found in Dr. Leirl3''s paper quoted. Thus, while it is true that 

 it is there remarked of the remains of Hadrosaurus occidentalism 

 " I suspect to be a Dinosaurian, though the}' may have belonged to 

 a Mammalian," he placed the genus " Thespesius," to which he 

 referred the species, under the capital heading " Mammalia." The 

 paj)er (Proceedings Academy^ 1856, 312) was divided into the 

 headings, Mammalia, Chelonia, and Pisces, and tiie species num- 

 bered, and Thesjyesiiis occidenfalis stands No. 4 under the first- 

 lamed heading. In regard to the genus Isch7j7^osauruH which was 

 ilso originally referred to the ^[ammalia, Dr. Leidy objected that 

 lis modified views had not also been quoted in the before-men- 

 ioned bulletin. Prof. Cope stated that he had already reprinted 

 hose later views in the Extinct Batractria and Reptilia of North 

 imerica, p. 39, as follows; "■although I have supposed the remains 

 •■. . to indicate ... an animal allied to the manatee . . . I have 

 sispecled that they have belonged to an aquatic reptile nnlike any 

 kiown."

'Notices of Rhizopods. — Prof. Leidy remarked that in the last 

 nuiber of the Archiv fur Mikroskopische Anatomic, presented 

 thii evening, there was an interesting paper b^' F. E. Schulze, 

 entiled Studies of the Rhizopods. With the exception of one 

 ne^\species, all of those represented in one of the accompanying 

 plats, Taf. Y., which had been previously described by others, he 

 ■was'amiliar with, as common in the vicinitj' of Philadelphia. The 

 genca and species are as follows : Euglypha alveolafa, Dujardin ; 

 E. dmpressa, Carter ; E. globosa, Carter ; Trinema acinus, Dn- 

 jardi ; and Cyphoderio. margaritacea, Schlumberger. Resides 

 thestof nearly related forms, he had found Euglypha spinosa, 

 Cartt, and several other species apparently undescribed. 



I. Eug^pha alveolata, Dujardin. E. tuherculata, Duj. 



'? Xfflugia setigera, Elirenberg. 



Thii species has an egg-shaped test, with over-lapping elliptical 

 scales/hich in one focus appear hexagonal in outline. The oral 

 scales re acute, and minutely denticulate. From two to six or 

 more s'nes project from the sides of the fundus of the test. The 

 largest'pecimens measure 0.132 mm. long, 0.08 mm. broad, with 

 the moCi 0.028 mm. The smallest ones measured 0.08 mm. long, 

 0.04 mnl)road, with the mouth O.Olfi mm. This species is com- 

 mon in \e ponds and ditches in the neighborhood of the e\ty.

 largest specimens measured 0.1 mm. long, 0.06 mm. broad, and 

 0.03 wide or thick ; with the mouth 0.052 broad, and 0.026 wide. 

 Smaller ones measured 0.08 mm. long, 0.036 broad, and 0.024 wide 



Abundant at Absecom, X. J. 



From the same localit}^ I obtained larger specimens of the same 

 form, but without spines, and also larger specimens covered witl 

 spines over three-fourths of the broad surfaces, as well as on thi 

 lateral borders. I propose, at a fitting opportunity, to investigatt 

 these still further, before expressing an opinion in regard to ther 

 identity with E. compressa. 



3. Euglypha spinosa, Carter. 



Test compressed-oval ; lateral borders subacute, and furnishd 

 with narrow delicate dagger-like spines ; mouth unusually broal, 

 and narrow. Surface of test covered with oval scales, as in tie 

 former species, but the oral row does not project beyond the m r- 

 gin of the mouth. The specimens usually measure 0.112 mm. loig, 

 0.072 mm. broad, and 0.036 wide; witli the mouth 0.04S brod,

 ovate or scutiform, with acute borders, w^ith an acute, subacute, 

 or transversely'' obtuse fundus. Mouth small, inconspicuously 

 defined, sometimes with the appearance of a C-like lip. Pseudo- 

 pods long, filiform, acutel}' branching and radiant from the mouth. 

 Protoplasm clear, granular, with a large nuclear vesicle, and one 

 or more contractile vacuoles. The animal moves slowlj' with the 

 test erect, and it feeds on diatomes, desraids, etc. The largest 

 specimens measured were 0.1 mm. long, bj- 0.06 broad, and 0.02 

 wide ; the smallest 04 long, 0.028 broad, and 0.012 wide. 



Found in a spring at Darbj' Station, on the "Westchester R. R., 

 Pa., and at Kirkwood Pond, on the Camden and Atlantic R. R., 

 New Jersey. 



This creature agrees well with the figures and description of 

 Plagiophrys scutiformis of Hertwig and Lesser (Archio f. Mik. 

 Anat., 1874, Taf. iii., figs. ii. a, b, c), but in size it rather accords 

 with the Plagiojohri/s cylindrica of Claparede and Lachmau. 




228 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Weathering of Backs. — Prof. Persifor Frazer, Jr., remarked 

 that the igneous rocks in the vicinity of Gettysburg, Pa., present 

 some curious phases of weathering. The ridge along which our 

 forces were disposed during the battle at that place, consists of a 

 syenite which at a point opposite the position of our army's ex- 

 treme left wing (or Round Top) has broken off, and lies in huge 

 bowlders piled up with great irregularity, and presenting surfaces 

 sometimes many hundred yards in area. These surfaces are some- 

 times furrowed by channels cut into them by running water, and 

 intersecting in all directions so as to present the general appear- 

 ance of a C3'clopean wall. The furrows are about an inch in depth, 

 and the raised surfaces which they separate, though slightl}' dis- 

 colored, present no signs of perfect disintegration. The similitude 

 to a coarse wall built up of fragments of all sizes, is striking and 

 deceptive even on a close examination. 



In some cases, this entire furrowed surface is detached b}'' a frac- 

 ture, which separates it as a mask from the normally constituted 

 mass beneath it, and in a few instances there were observed two 

 such shells one beneath the other. 



This gave the whole rock a concretionar}' appearance wliieh was 

 remarkable for the tolerably constant thickness of the shells, con- 

 sidering the want of homogeneousuess of the rock. It raises an 

 interesting question of how rocks ma}^ assume this character by 

 weathering: alone.

230 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



One hundred and thh-ty-one letters have been written during 

 the year to editors and societies, asking for a supply of such parts 

 and volumes as were necessary to complete the Academy's set of 

 their publications. In several cases the parts asked for have been 

 received already, and a large number of favorable answers may be 

 confldentl}^ expected during the coming spring. 

 All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edward J. Nolan, Librarian. 



REPORT OP THE CURATORS. 



Little has been done during the past j^ear in the arrangement 

 of the Museum of the Academy. Mr. Charles E. Parker, one of 

 the Curators, went over the alcoholic specimens, renewing the 

 alcohol, and otherwise securing their preservation. 



The contributions to the Museum during the year are as fol- 

 lows : — 



Mammals. — A Bat from Fort Randall, Dakota, presented by 

 Dr. W. T. Thackeray, U.S. A. ; a Flying Squirrel from Texas, by 

 S. B. Buckley ; a large variety of the Cat, by A. Gr. B, Hinkle ; a 

 monstrous Pig, by W. Cox ; the skin of an Ant-eater, by an 

 unknown donor. 



Dr. A. M. Owen U. S.N., presented five human skulls from the 

 Fiji, Marquesas, and Sandwich Islands. 



Skeletons of a Cavia and a Muskrat were presented by Jacob 

 Creismar. 



Birds. — Nineteen specimens, thirteen species of bird skins were 

 presented by a unknown donor. A small collection of bird skins, 

 from Nicaragua, was presented by Dr. John F. Bransford, U. S. N.

REPORT OF RECORDER OF BIOLOGICAL AND 

 MICROSCOPICAL SECTION. 



December 7th, 1874. 



In reviewing the events of our microscopical year, I think we 

 may find just cause for mutual congratulation, in the fact, that 

 although the number of original papers presented before the Sec- 

 tion has been less than on some previous occasions, yet we have 

 in the past twelve months done more than almost ever before, to 

 popularize a knowledge of the wonders of microscopic investiga- 

 tion, to interest the community in our special branch of natural 

 science, and to convince the citizens of Philadelphia that we form 

 a living active department, of an Association well worthy of more 

 general encouragement, as well as of more bountiful pecuniarj'^ 

 aid. 



These important objects have of course been chieflj'^ advanced 

 by the successful management of our two semi-annual Exhibitions, 

 the latter, and more satisfactory of which, was contributed to by 

 eminent microscopists of New Yoi'k and Boston, as well as of 

 Philadelphia, and "was witnessed by nearly one thousand of our 

 citizens. " The microscopes" (to quote from the report of Dr. J. 

 H. McQuillen, Chairman of the Committee), "forty in number, were 

 arranged on tables in three rooms of the library, and the principal, 

 if not the only drawback of the exhibition, was the contracted 

 space and the impossibility of properly accommodating the large 

 number of persons present." 



During the year original communications were presented by Dr. 

 James Tyson, "On a Set of Barth's Classified Specimens in Patho- 

 logical Anatomy," by Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt, on his novel and 

 16 




234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



])eaatiful method of "Double Staining Vegetable Structures," by 

 which certain portions of a plant may be colored green in situ 

 without dissection, whilst other parts are tinted violet ; by Mr. 

 D. S. Holman, on his very ingenious "Siphon Life Slide ;" and by 

 J. Gr. Richardson, " On the Supposed Hepatic Structure in the 

 Connecting Band of the Siamese Twins," "On the Value of High 

 Powers in the Diagnosis of Blood Stains," and " On the Perform- 

 ance of Two One-Fiftieth Objectives." 



Most of these communications gave rise to copious discussions 

 among our members, eliciting a variety of opinions in regard to 

 the subject under consideration, and it is to be hoped materially 

 advancing the cause of science, by the establishment of some new 

 and positive facts. The debates, as reported for the columns of 

 the Philadelphia Medical Times, have possessed so much general 

 interest to the Medical profession, that they continue to be warmly 

 welcomed by the editors of that valuable journal. 



The improved m.ethod of announcing the date of meeting, with 

 the title, etc., of some communication to be made and discussed, 

 by the employment of the United States Postal cards, has contri- 

 buted largely to the interest of our sittings, and at a decreased 

 expense. 



All of which is respectful!}' submitted by 



Jos. G. Richardson, Recorder, 



REPORT OF CONSERVATOR OF CONCHOLOGICAL 



SECTION. 



The Conservator of the Conchological Section respectfully re- 

 ports that the following additions have been made to the Cabinet 

 during the year 1874 : — 



Jeanes., Jos. Fourteen species of Terrestrial Mollusks, from 



Mauritius and Madagascar. 

 Smithsonian Institution. Eight species of fresh-water shells 



from Colorado. 

 Lea, Isaac. Anodonta Leonensis, Lea; A. Ferussaciana, Lea, 



from Fort Hayes, Kansas, and Anci/lus, from Florida. 

 Bransford, Dr. J. F. Several species of Mollusks from Nica- 



I 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 235 



Jones, Dr. Wm.. U. S. N. Mollusks in alcohol from the Pacific 



Coast of America. 

 Leidy, Dr. Jos. Specimens of Pecten Magellanicus from Noank, 



Conn. 

 Mortimer, Capt. J. H. Thirty-four alcoholic specimens of Oceanic 



Mollusca beautifully prepared. 

 Sixteen species of Terrestrial Mollusks, from Mauritius and 



Madagascar, were purchased. 



At the last meeting of the Academy the reception of the Terres- 

 trial Shells of the Swift Collection was announced, and the thanks 

 of the Academy were ordered to i)e conveyed to Mr. Thomas Bland, 

 for the care exercised by him in labelling, arranging, and forward- 

 ing the specimens. The remaining part of the collection is now 

 in the hands of Prof. 0. A. L. Morch, of Copenhagen, to whom 

 it had been sent for determination. The two portions form the 

 finest collection of West Indian shells in existence, and when 

 arranged in our Cabinet will be a valuable addition to a collec- 

 tion which is alread}' one of the largest in the world. 



Apart from arranging the specimens received during the year, 

 the work of the Section has been confined to the preparation of a 

 reference index to the collection, the arrangement of which, as I 

 had the pleasux-e of reporting last 3'ear, was completed during 

 1873. This index, embracing 15*74 generic and family names, was 

 rendered necessary by the extent of the collection, and has been 

 found of great service b}' those wishing to examine [tarticular spe- 

 cies. 



All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edw. J. Nolan, M.D., Gonnervator. 



The election of Officers for 1875 was held in accordance with 

 the by-laws, with the following result: — 



President . . . W. S. W. Ruschenberger, M.D.
