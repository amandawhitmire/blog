On the Morphology of superimposed Stamens. — At the meeting 

 of the Botanical Section on January 11, Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 remarked that Sachs teaches that stamens " must be considered 

 morphologically as foliar structures, and make it convenient to 

 term them Staminal Leaves," ^ and Dr. Asa Gray defines a stamen 

 to be " one of the elements or phylla of the androecium."^ So far

PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



[1886. 



as the speaker knew, no botanist regards the stamen as an axial 

 development, }■ et there are occasional phenomena that seem to be 

 inexplicable on any other hypothesis. We have to admit that a 

 flower is not merely composed of modified leaves, but is a modified 

 branch ; — the branch, arrested in its development, produces sepals 

 and petals in the order and in the place where leaves might have 

 been. Occasionally, however, the usual order of phyllotaxis seems 

 broken. Stamens will spring from the base of petals, and oppo- 

 site, where we looked for them to alternate ; and then for the 

 sake of consistency with the phyllal hypothesis, we have to 

 assume that one theoretic whorl has proved abortive, or that there 

 has been a multiplication of whorls, the superimposed one being 

 the extra. This introduction of an extra series, immediately over 

 the lower, not provided for in the original phyllotaxy, has, I 

 think, never been seen in the normal condition of the branch, 

 and it is difl&cult to conceive how this could occur under the 

 arrestation of axial growth that transforms the branch into a 

 flower. On the other hand, if we take the petal to be the analogue 

 of the leaf on the elongated branch, there seems no reason why 

 there should not be, theoretically, an axial bud to the petal ; and, 

 should this bud develop, it would be the superimposed stamen. 

 Branching and articulated stamens are frequent in those families 

 that have these organs spring, as it were, from an axial bud at 

 the base of the petal, as in a diminutive or suppressed secondary 

 branch we might expect them to do. 



The flowers of Mahemia verticillata Cav., a well-known Byttneri- 

 aceous plant from the Cape of Good Hope, common in cultivation, 

 which he exhibited this evening, seem to indicate that its super- 

 imposed stamens are really arrested branches. The genus is 

 separated from Hermannia chiefly by a cup-shaped gland at the 

 middle of the stamen (see Fig. 2). A comparison with the 



axial development of the inflores- 

 cence shows the stamen to be formed 

 on precisely the same plan as the bi- 

 flowered peduncle (Fig. 1). Really 

 the flowers are axillar^^ — a single 

 flower being produced from the axil 

 of each leaf. What appears to be 

 the " two-flowered jDeduncle " of 

 authors is simplj' a diminutive 

 branchlet. After forming one node 

 the longitudinal development be- 

 comes nearly arrested, and we have 

 only a shortly-pedicillate and slowly 

 developing flower, representing the 

 shorter of the two in the cut. The 

 bud in the axil of the bracteolate 

 leaflet, however, makes another and stronger attempt at growth, 

 and pushes up and over the one which terminates the first growth.

1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 11 



In the development of the stamen we read in the same lan- 

 guage. The lower leaf from -which the short though main 

 peduncle in the inflorescence appears, is typified by the petal. 

 The common peduncle is represented by the filament, and the 

 cup-like gland at the middle stands for the bracteole of the bi- 

 pedicels. Here one of the flower buds — probably the outermost 

 and weakest in the normal development — wholly disappears, the 

 innermost becomes the upper part of the filament, the next node 

 may be at the connective, and then the theoretical floral leaves 

 proceed to form the anther. The incised bract is reduced to 

 the fringed cup-like gland from which the stamen proper springs. 



A close examination of the stamen gives some further facts in 

 support of this theoretical view. When a branchlet is produced 

 from a branch, it is necessarily more slender than the parent 

 branch. The upper half of the Mahernia filament is more slender 

 than the part beneath the gland, and, while the lower portion is 

 smooth and membranous, the upper is minutely hispid — variations 

 which we might only expect in distinct internodes. Only for its 

 actual office in supporting and appearing in the direct line of the 

 stamen, we might critically call the lower portion a peduncle, and 

 the portion above the gland the stamen proper. 



And we may conclude, after a whole stud}' of the subject, that 

 in many cases superimposed stamens are the development of 

 theoretical axial buds at the base of the petals, and not the result 

 of an interjection of an extra whorl of leaves for which there 

 would be no warrant in phyllotaxy.

 Fourteen persons present. 



Mastodon and Llama from Florida. — Prof. Leidy directed 

 attention to some fossil bones, being part of a collection now at 

 the Biological Department of the University, recently received 

 for examination from the 'Director of the U, S. Geological 

 Survey. The collection was made by Mr. W. H. Dall, near Archer, 

 Florida, in a locality discovered by Dr. J. C. Neal, who had pre- 

 viousl}' sent specimens to the Smithsonian Institution, and others 

 directly to Prof. Leidy for identification. Some of these speci- 

 mens had been brought to the notice of the Academy, as indicating 

 a species of rhinoceros and of a horse, to the former of which 

 the name of R. ijroterus was given, and to the latter that of Hip- 

 potherium ingenuiim. In the collection recently received are' 

 numerous bones and well-preserved teeth of the rhinoceros, mostly 

 limb bones, among whicli are fourteen well-preserved astragali. 



Some of the specimens exhibited are those of a mastodon, 

 apparently a previously undescribed form, although upwards of 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



a half dozen distinct species have been characterized as pertaining 

 to North America. An unworn crown of a last inferior molar 

 tooth resembles most nearly that of the Mastodon angustidens of 

 Europe, but is much larger. It has the same number of crests, 

 but the fifth is proportionately much more developed, being 

 divided into two lobes, about two-thirds the size of those of the 

 fourth crest. It is also much larger than in M. andium, and has 

 its lobes proportionately more robust, and is provided with a 

 well-produced external basal ridge. 



The following are comparative measurements of what appear 

 the most closely allied forms : — 



Florida mastodon, 

 M. angustidens, 

 M. andium, 



Small fragments of tusks indicate the possession of a band of 

 enamel, as in the M. angustidens. For the species, the name of 

 Mastodon (Trilophodon) florid anus was proposed. 



Among the fossils are several isolated teeth, and bones appar- 

 ently indicating three species of Llama. Judging from the 

 astragali, one was about the size of the existing South American 

 species ; another, of which there are five astragali, as large or 

 larger than the camel, and a third of intermediate size. The 

 measurements of the astragali are as follows : — 



Large species. Length, 100 mm. Breadth, TO mm. 

 Medium do. " 65 " " 42 " 



Small do. " 50 " " 35 " 



The three species may be distinguished by the names of 



AUCHENIA MAJOR, MINOR and MINIMUS. 



Among the fossils is an astragalus of Megatherium.

ON SOME NEW PSOCIDffi. 

 S. FRANK AARON. 



The several new species described here are in the collections of 

 the American Entomological Society. 



Csecilius subflavus. 



Almost entirely pale yellowish, or bright luteous, very sparsely 

 pilose. Antennae and palpi very pale, the former slightly fuscous 

 on the basal joints. E^'es black and yellow. Ocelli rufous brown, 

 small. On each side of the occiput, from and behind the eye, a 

 fuscous cloud or band, not joining in the middle. Thorax and 

 abdomen yellowish, the anterior lobe of the former with a faint 

 darker spot, and the latter with some fuscous markings ; appendages 

 brighter yellow. Feet pale, semitransparent. Wings hyaline, 

 very slightly clouded iu the cells with pale luteous, and with a 

 nucleated darker spot directlj^ below the posterior angle of the 

 pterostigma. Veins luteous, and with the pterostigma, having a 

 few fuscous hairs, each springing from a black point. Length to 

 end of wings about 2-2'5 millim. 



Southern Texas. I collected this species from live oak trees 

 along the river bottoms ; found only two specimens, male and 

 female. The male is smaller, eyes black and large, the thorax 

 fuscous (probably discolored by drying), and the clouds in the 

 wings pale brown. 



Caecilius nubilis. Plate I, fig. 3. 



Pale luteous. Antennae and palpi entirely pale. Nasus some- 

 what indistinctly clouded. Ocelli dark brown. An irregular 

 maculate pale brown line on each side of the head, extending 

 from within the margin of the eyes to the posterior central 

 portion of the occiput, and a double maculate paler brown line 

 dividing the occiput and almost reaching the ocelli. Eyes pale, 

 with a yellowish green reflection. Thorax pale, the lobes clouded 

 with pale brown. Abdomen paler, the sutures, in part, brown. 

 Legs very pale, the last tarsal joint fuscous. Wings hyaline, 

 pterostigma the same, not more opaque ; veins brown, the larger 

 ones, on the basal half of the wing, paler, and on the apical half, 

 wherever they join the margin of the wing, they are, together 

 with the marginal vein at that point, black, or deep fuscous, 




14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



surrounded by a small pale brown clouded spot. Each cell in 

 the apical half of the wing has, midway between the veins, a pale 

 brown cloud, approximately taking the shape of its cell. At the 

 base of the pterostigma a small black spot, and another at the 

 junction of the cubitus and posterior margin. Length to end of 

 wings about 2 millim. 



Southern Texas. One specimen discovered while beating a 

 live oak thicket on the prairies. 



Csecilius impacatus. 



Pale yellow and brown. Antennae much shoi'ter than wings, 

 fuscous, the basal joints and the first long joint in part, pale ; 

 palpi fuscous. Nasus pale, somewhat clouded with brown ; rest 

 of head j^ellow with brown markings, the space before and 

 directly around the separated golden colored ocelli, brown; a 

 brown band on each side bordering the inside margin of the eyes, 

 and another on each side of the dividing occipital suture, reach- 

 ing each posterior ocellus. Ej'^es brown and pale, about con- 

 colorouswith the other parts. Mesothoracic lobes brown, deeper 

 colored anteriorly, the sutures pale 3'ellowish ; rest of thorax pale 

 yellow and brown. Abdomen pale, the sutures brown, and brown 

 markings at the apex. Legs pale, the apical tarsal joint darker. 

 Wings clear hyaline, the seemingly delicate veins pale brown. A 

 small black spot at the base of the pterostigma, and another at 

 the junction of the cubitus and posterior margin. Otherwise the 

 wings are entirely unmarked. About 3'5 millim. long to end of 

 wings. 



Penn. (near Philadelphia). — I beat one specimen from the 

 branches of a beech, and, on account of its constant activity found 

 it very difficult to capture, almost hopelessly mashing it in doing 

 so. 



PsocuB campestris. 



Luteous and pale brown. Antennse about as long as the 

 wings, fuscous, the basal joints luteous; palpi pale, fuscous on 

 the extreme apex. Nasus short, lineated with brown, and 

 sparsely pilose ; rest of head luteous, a brown irregular patch on 

 the margin of nasus before the ocelli ; a narrow black line 

 dividing, the occiput ; faint fuscous maculose markings on each 

 side, within the margin of the e^'es. Ocelli black ; eyes brown, 

 with paler reflections. Lobes of the thorax brown, the sutures 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



luteous. Abdomen pale brown, the sutures and underneath in 

 part pale. Legs pale, femora somewhat yellowish. Wings per- 

 fectly hyaline, the veins pale brown, semitransparent luteous in 

 parts ; pterostigraa, a narrow space directly beneath it, and the 

 indication of a small spot at the junction of the cubitus and pos- 

 terior margin, pale brown. Length to end of wing about 2*5 mill. 

 Southern Texas. One specimen taken from the live oak trees 

 that compose the small groves (motts) on the prairies. It is 

 allied to Ps. quietus, of Hagen (many specimens of which I also 

 found in the same locality, but in different situations, viz. : on 

 yellow berry bushes), but differs from that species in being con- 

 siderabl}' smaller, in having the nasus shorter, not reaching the 

 ocelli, and by having fewer markings on the head. 



Psocus Leidyi. Plate I, fig. 2. 



Pale yellowish and black. Antennae nearly as long as the 

 wings, subfuscous, the basal joints pale; palpi pale, the apical 

 joint subfuscous. Head pale yellowish, deepest on the nasus, 

 which is faintly lineated with paler ; a large shining black 

 rounded spot in the middle of the upper part of the nasus, bor- 

 dering the suture ; beneath the antennae, on each side, a small 

 black spot ; ocelli black ; occiput with a brown band on the 

 dividing suture containing a double row of darker spots almost 

 reaching the ocelli. E3'es black. Lobes of the thorax black, 

 shining, the sutures and the rest of the thorax pale yellow. 

 Abdomen pale yellow, the sutures black, merging into a longitu- 

 dinal row of irregular spots on each side of the dorsum ; a large, 

 irregular, shining black patch on the dorsum of the apical seg- 

 ment, with a smaller black spot on each side below it. Abdo- 

 men beneath partly fuscous. Apical appendages, yellow and 

 black. Legs very pale, the base of the tibia with a black spot 

 beneath, and the tarsi subfuscous, the apical joint black. Wings 

 clear hyaline, veins mostly fuscous, that enclosing the pteros- 

 tigma yellow, and the veins enclosing the discoidal cellule, with 

 certain of their branches, in part pale yellowish and light brown. 

 Pterostigma subopaque, a small black spot at its base, a rounded 

 clouded brown spot posteriorly within its apex, and another 

 brown spot directly below and contiguous to its posterior angle ; 

 at the basal angle of the discoidal cell a large rounded brown 

 spot, and another smaller at the junction of the cubitus and 




16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



inner margin. Hind wing immaculate. Length to end of wings 

 about 5 5-6 mill. 



Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. From two specimens col- 

 lected many years ago by Dr. Joseph Leidy in Rhode Island, 

 and two specimens taken by myself near Philadelphia, on the 

 trunks of chestnut trees, where they appeared to be solitary. 

 For some time I had, somewhat doubtfully, supposed this species 

 to be Ri. canadensis, of Prov., until I received a letter from Dr. 

 Hagen, referring canadensis to the genus Elipsocus. 



Fsocus texanus. 



Pale yellow, with brown markings. Antennae longer than the 

 wings, fuscous, pale at the base. Nasus lineated with brown ; rest 

 of head above with irregular markings, viz, : a horseshoe spot 

 before the ocelli, an irregular line on each side from near the 

 base of the antennae to the ocelli ; a line of spots within the 

 margin of the eye, occiput with a line of spots on each side of the 

 dividing suture that come together just behind the ocelli. Eyes 

 brown, with a slight golden tinge ; ocelli black. Lobes of the 

 mesothorax clouded with fuscous, the sutures pale yellow. Abdo- 

 men marked with fuscous, and the anal appendages yellow. 

 Legs luteous, the apical tarsal joints fuscous. Wings hyaline, 

 the veins biown ; pterostigma less clear, a fuscous spot within 

 its apical half, and another just below it; a fuscous band crosses 

 the entire wing in the middle, its outer margin reaching from the 

 base of the pterostigma to the junction of the cubital and post- 

 costal veins and the posterior margin, passing through the basal 

 angle of the discoidal cell. Hind wings hyaline, no markings. 

 Length to end of wings about 4 mill. 



Var. submarginatus. Plate I, fig. 1. 



Characterized by having the fore wings with additional mark- 

 ings in the form of a submarginal fuscous baud or cloud, 

 reaching from the second apical nervule to the posterior apical 

 extremity of the discoidal cell, and with a few somewhat 

 rounded spots between the nei'vures bordering upon and beyond 

 the discoidal cell. Length about 3 mill. Otherwise like texanus. 



Southern Texas. I took fifteen specimens oi texanus 2ind. four 

 of var. submarginatus entirely by beating from yellow berry 

 bushes, black chaparral and live oak, over the prairies. It is 

 probably the commonest species in its locality. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, lY 



ECHMEPTERYX nov. gen. 



Head much as in Psocus, etc.. the ocelli more widely separated. 

 Antennae with the two basal joints short and stout, the others rather 

 slender, each joint attenuated in its middle, swollen somewhat at 

 its apex. Dorsum of mesothorax entire, not divided into lobes, 

 extended into a projection posteriorly. Tarsi three-jointed. 

 Wings covered with scales of various forms. Apex of loings 

 pointed, and furnished somewliat densely with long hair. Neura- 

 tion peculiar, as shown in Plate 1, figs. 5-6. 



Belongs to a group with Amphientomiim and Perientomum, 

 probably most closely allied to Dr. Hagen's Amph. (Syllysis) can- 

 datum ; differs in the neuration. 



Echmepteryx agilis. Plate I, figs. 4-0. 



Antennae much shorter than the wings, pale fuscous ; palpi 

 fuscous. Nasus fuscous, pilose ; rest of head somewhat pilose, 

 pale, with dark brown markings, a bent brown line across the 

 head, transversely, separating the anterior from the posterior 

 ocelli; before the ocelli, in the middle, some irregular bi'own 

 markings and bands (varying in diflferent specimens), and between 

 the ocelli, connecting with the transverse line, two convergent 

 brown lines, extending to a brown patch on each side upon the 

 occiput ; on each side, within the margin of the eyes, another 

 brown spot, becoming a line, and also joining the occipital patches. 

 Ocelli black, each one within a small brown spot ; eyes brown and 

 golden yellow. Thorax brown, portions pale luteous, dorsum of 

 mesothorax dark brown, somewhat scaled, and very pilose. 

 Abdomen pale yellowish oi- luteous (in some specimens fuscous, 

 probably discolored by drying), with some brown markings. 

 Legs fuscous, somewhat paler or luteous ; tarsi luteous, fuscous 

 towards base. Wings fuscescent or smoky when denuded, becom- 

 ing hyaline towards the apex ; veins darker, semitransparent. 

 Scales mostly fuscescent, paler towards the base; when upon the 

 wing seemingly fuscous, and when thickly placed appearing almost 

 black; other scales luteous upon the wing. -These scales cause 

 the wing to be covered with black, fuscous and luteous patches. 

 The long apical hair mostly fuscous, luteous in patches. Hind 

 wings hyaline, slightly infuscated, no scales, the long apical hair 

 fuscous. Length to end of wing about 3 millim. 



Pennsylvania. I found this species on the trunks of beech

trees in a woods near Philadelphia. It is very active, quick and 

 difficult to secure. I believe it represents a group entirely new 

 to our fauna.

THE INCLUSIONS IN THE GRANITE OF CRAFTSBURY, VT. 

 BY CALVIN McCOKMICK. 



The inclusions usually- found in granites are observed to vary 

 to a marked extent in outline, structure and mode of occurrence. 

 Very often they resemble imbedded fragments of older rocks. 

 They are usually darker than the including granite, and are either 

 circular or angular. When rounded they resemble an enclosed 

 pebble ; when angular, a fragment of slate or mica schist. They 

 sometimes merge into the surrounding rock by thrusting out 

 minute connective particles. The}^ are generally finer in texture, 

 and hence less easily decomposed by atmospheric agencies than 

 the enclosing granite. 



A reference to the recorded observations on granitic inclusions 

 will doubtless assist materiall}- in the study of the subject. In 

 1821, Dr. John MaccuUoch, in his "Geological Classification of 

 Rocks," p. 230, refers to inclusions as "irregular patches or veins 

 of a fine texture, spheroidal in arrangement, imbedded in coarse 

 granite." In 1858, Dr. Carl P. Naumann refers to " pseudo-frag- 

 mentar}' concretions resembling sharp-angled fragments common 

 in crystalline siliceous rocks." (Lehrbuch der Geognosie, 2 Auf., 

 Band I, S. 422, 560 ; B. II, S. 203.) 



In the same year Dr. F. Hochstetter states that " the granites 

 of Billstou Island contain micaceous fine-grained, dark, globular 

 enclosures." (Jahrb. k. k. geolog. Reichsan., S. 285.) 



In 1863, Dr. F. Y. Andrian, referring to the hornblendic granites 

 of Central Bohemia, mentions " innumerable fine-grained enclos- 

 ures, sharply segregated from the surrounding rock, varying in 

 size from -^^s ^o '^ inches in diameter. These enclosures contain 

 small quantities of hornblende crystals. From their abundance 

 and identity of constituents they were produced during the solidi- 

 fication of the rock mass, b}' a process of segregation, the exact 

 nature of which is unknown." (Beit. z. Geolog. d. Kaur. Tab. 

 Krei. Bohmen, S. 166.) 



In an article on the " Metamorphic Origin of certain Granitoid 

 Rocks and Granites in the Southern Uplands of Scotland," Prof. 

 James Geikie describes " nests of altered rock in a gray granite. 

 These are distinctly laminated, fine-grained, micaceous and 

 imparting a dark shade to the rock. They are irregular in shape, 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



and scattered indiscriminately throughout the mass." (Geo- 

 logical Magazine, 1861, vol. 3, p. 533.) 



All of these observations relate to the external appearance of 

 these inclusions. No one of these writers has given us an intima- 

 tion of the microscopic or chemical nature of their internal 

 structure. In this respect Prof. J. A. Phillips has greatly sur- 

 passed his predecessors. 



In the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. 36, p. 

 1, this author describes granites and their inclusions from numer- 

 ous British localities. The Cornwall granites at Lamorna, Zennor, 

 and Luxulyan contain numerous black patches, angular, fine- 

 grained and composed of quartz and mica. The granite of Shap 

 in Westmoreland encloses numerous well-defined, dark, round 

 patches, fine-grained and varying in size from ^ to 15 inches in 

 diameter. 



In Scotland, the Aberdeen granites (metamorphic, Haughton) 

 contain foliated, subangular inclusions of black mica. 



In Ireland, the granite of Newry (metamorphic, Hull; igneous, 

 Kinahan) afi"ords inclusions which are apparently concretions. 

 The Mourne granite (eruptive) contains ovoid and angular, fine- 

 grained dark masses of mica and quartz. 



This author derives the following conclusions from these 

 observations : 



These granitic inclusions are of two distinct kinds. The first 

 is the result of an abnormal arrangement of the constituent minerals. 

 The second represents the enclosed fragments of other rocks. Of 

 the first, the outline is more or less ovoid, and they are essentially 

 a part of the including granite. The dark color is due to the 

 quantity of mica and hornblende. A second nodule contained in 

 the first, is indicative of concretionary origin. 



The formation of rounded inclusions in granites is believed to 

 be contemporaneous with the solidification of the mass, and 

 similar to that of the well known Napoleonite or orbicular 

 diorite of Corsica. 



Of the second class, the inclusions are irregular in outline, 

 schistose in structure, traversed by quartz veins or divided by 

 strings of granite. They are frequently unaltered, and are easily 

 recognized as fragments of gneiss, hornblendic and micaceous 

 rocks. 



In our own country, Professor Irving, in his report " On the 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 21 



Copper-Bearing Rocks of Lake Superior " (U. S. Geol. Survey, 

 vol. V, p. 125), refers to a hornblenclic granite containing an 

 augitic core, and the entire mass showing minute flakes of 

 biotite. Mr. Clai-ence King, in his " Systematic Geology " (U. 

 S. Survey, p. 120), graphically describes the remarkable granitic 

 wall of El Capitan, in the Yosemite Valley. This presents a 

 vertical face 3200 feet high, dotted with irregular cloud-like 

 masses and lenticular bodies, apparently segregations of the 

 component minerals (brilliant black hornblende, quartz, biotite 

 and orthoclase). This segregation he considers to be the result 

 of mechanical accidents. 



Having thus hastily glanced at observations relating to granitic 

 inclusions in other localities, we are better prepared to under- 

 stand those of the Craftsburj^ region. In the following consid- 

 erations we will observe, first, the including granite itself; 

 second, the included nodules, their external appearance and 

 internal structure, and the relation of the rock-mass to its 

 inclusions. 



This nodular granite consists of the usual ingredients of a 

 true granite — quartz, feldspar and mica. The quartz is the most 

 abundant constituent. It possesses the properties of ordinary 

 quartz as to color, lustre and. hardness. The feldspar is the 

 common orthoclase, everj' light in color — even resembling the 

 quartz in this respect. The mica is the black variety (biotite), 

 and is sparingly scattered through the mass. It is in striking 

 contrast with the white components, and gives the rock the 

 appearance of S3'enite. But no hornblende is present, nor have 

 accessory minerals been observed. These constituents are dis- 

 seminated irregularly throughout the rock-mass, and since they 

 occur in small dimensions, this mass is fine-grained in texture. 

 According to Prof. H. A. Cutting, State Geologist of Vermont, 

 this granite occurs in place like other granites, but south of the 

 beds it consists of numerous large bowlders. 



Professor C. H. Hitchcock refers this granite to the Coos 

 group, which he places directlj^ below the Lower Helderberg 

 division of the Upper Silurian. 



The Inclusions. — These are spheroidal or elongated nodules of 

 biotite, from one-half to two inches in diameter, with the long 

 axis sometimes four inches. They are more or less flattened, and 

 frequently consist of only a few plates. Their surface is smooth 




22 PROCEEDINGS OT THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



or sometimes plicated, the folds corresponding to the long axis. 

 Then the}' resemble a dried butternut, stripped of its epicarp. 

 Several convex scales may be detached from a flat specimen, 

 placed on edge, with a sharp blow of the hammer. 



They are distributed irregularly through the rock-mass. In 

 some portions they are more abundant than in others. Some 

 parts of the Craftsbury beds are composed entirely of nodules, 

 slightly cemented b}' grains of quartz and mica. It appears 

 that there is no law as to their distribution. From this locality 

 to the Canadian line it is stated that these inclusions are very 

 rare, in the beds extending over this area of about forty miles. 

 (C. H. Hitchcock, Geology of Yermont, vol. 2, pp. 564, 721). 



The Internal Structure. — But few microscopic sections of these 

 nodules have been prepared. In studying the lithology of New 

 Hampshire, Mr. Gr. W. Hawes, formerly of the ShefJEield Scientific 

 School, made a section of the centre of a nodule, and observed 

 that the biotite is dichroic, that a small portion of muscovite and 

 some quartz are present. No nucleus was apparent, but a con- 

 centric arrangement of the mica scales, which he considered to 

 be the basis of the formation of the inclusion. (Geology of New 

 Hamp., vol. 3, pt 4, p. 203.) On account of the limited observa- 

 tions of this peculiar formation, I attempted to prepare some 

 sections of the internal structure. Of these, two were through 

 the centre, and parallel to the longitudinal axis. These show 

 that the biotite is in concentric layers, with grains of quartz scat- 

 tered irregularly through it. No feldspar is present. These 

 layers of biotite are made up of flakes or long bands. Along the 

 thin edges they are of a light brown color, while the thicker 

 masses are dark. The flakes are of different sizes respecting 

 length and width. They are arranged very much like the scales 

 on a fish. The biotite constitutes the greater part of the surface. 

 It forms fully four-fifths, and doubtless even more in some cases. 

 The quartz is remarkably translucent and verj'^ distinctly vitre- 

 ous. During the grinding process, frequent observations with a 

 lens indicated that the quartz increases in abundance towards 

 the centre. 



Several transverse sections parallel to the lateral axis were 

 attempted, but the brittle nature of the biotite prevented success. 

 This, it is thought, ma}^ be accomplished by hardening a specimen 

 in shellac dissolved in alcohol. Sections through other portions 

 of the nodule denote the laminated structure of the biotite. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES 01* PHlLABEtPHIA. 23 



The Relation of the Nodule to the Rock Mass. — The line of 

 contact between the inclusion and the including rock is not always 

 distinct. But it is possible to extract the former with compara- 

 tive ease. The remaining cavity, however, is usually lined with 

 biotite, which, adhering to it rather than to the nodule, indicates 

 that the inclusion was originally formed from the rock mass. 

 Sections across this line of contact, show considerable quartz and 

 a small quantity of biotite. These minerals are apparently inter- 

 locked, further denoting that the biotitic mass belongs to the 

 surrounding rock. 



General Conclusions. — First, concerning the nodules : These 

 are not micaceous rolls, for their structure internally shows dis- 

 tinct bands. N or are they concretions, for no nucleus is observed. 

 But they are masses of flakes of biotite cemented with quartz, 

 abnormally segregated from the original granitic mass. These 

 flakes, although originally concentric, were afterwards arranged 

 radially, hence producing the nodular form. (Dr. Zepharowich, 

 Mineralogical Lexicon, Austria, p. 59.) 



Second, concerning the granite : The presence of these nodules 

 indicates the igneous origin of the granite. Were the original 

 mass in aqueous solution, the material would have been evenly 

 distributed, and the nodules could not have occurred. Were it 

 of metamorphic origin, the nodules would scarcely be so uniform 

 in outline and microscopic appearance, but would be more or less 

 contorted. These nodules denote a state of fluidity of the entire 

 mass which resulted from igneous agencies. While in this fluid 

 condition, the nodules first formed, and were enclosed by the 

 surrounding mass. This is sustained by the wrinkled and folded 

 surface of the nodules, which doubtless was occasioned by the 

 contraction of the surrounding mass as it cooled. 



The fact that biotite is a frequent constituent of igneous rocks, 

 has its influence in sustaining the igneous origin of this granite. 

 This is also sustained by the investigations of local phenomena. 

 (Geology New Hamp., vol. 1, p. 538.) 



The inclusions at Craftsbury are unique in type, differing from 

 those of all other localities. 



These observations may be modified by further investigations, 

 but it is hoped that they may elicit an extended interest in the 

 subject. 



Appendix. — Since the preceding pages were written, my atten- 




24 PROCEEDINGS OF THB ACADEMT OP [1886. 



tion was directed to inclusions in certain flaggings in Pliiladel- 

 phia, on Chestnut Street above Tliird Street, and on Filbert Street 

 above Thirteenth Street. It was desirable to trace the localities 

 of these rocks. 



B}' the assistance of the City Commissioner of Highways, and 

 the dealer who furnished the stone for the Chestnut Street pave- 

 ment, the locality was ascertained to be Connecticut or Maine. 



The doubt in the case arises from the fact that the stone was 

 furnished about twenty-five years ago, no record of its locality 

 was kept, and the dealer is unable to recall with any degree 

 of certainty the exact location. The granite in external charac- 

 ters closely resembles that of New London, Conn., as well as that 

 of Sullivan, Maine. Hence this feature is comparatively valueless 

 in the determination. But the resemblance of the inclusions to 

 those in the Sullivan granite, favors the view that this location is 

 the home of the Chestnut Street flags. 



These inclusions are not numerous, nor regular in size and 

 outline. They are made up of biotite, are elongated elliptically, 

 frequently terminating in acute points. The length is eight or 

 ten inches, and the width two or three inches. These masses 

 blend into the surrounding rock, without affording any distinct 

 line of separation, hence suggesting that their extraction would 

 involve considerable difficulty. That these were produced in a 

 way similar to those of Craftsbury, is apparent from external 

 observations, and doubtless sections of the internal structure 

 will sustain this supposition. 



No evidence was obtained concerning the locality of the Filbert 

 Street rock. Its worn condition denotes a long period of service. 

 These inclusions tend to detract from the value of granites, as 

 they afford an easy access for destructive agents (moisture, frost, 

 heat), and hence such granites having a limited use, are not apt 

 to be seen along public thoroughfares.

METHODS OF DEFENSE IN ORGANISMS. 

 BY CHAS. MORRIS. 



Some weeks ago I presented a paper on this subject to the 

 Academy. I wish to add a few suggestions to the considerations 

 there taken, and particular!}^ to speak of the evolution of the 

 sponge, considered from the point of view of defense. As is 

 well known, the sponge tj^pe of organism is one that it has 

 proved difficult to classify, since it only partly conforms to the 

 type of the Ca?lenterates, while it is widely divergent from anj^ 

 other animal type. I may briefly point out these divergent 

 features. 



In all other animals above the Protozoans, except those para- 

 sitic forms which are destitute of an intestine, the mouth is a 

 single aperture, which constitutes the main opening into the 

 bo^ly. In the sponge type this single aperture is replaced by a 

 multitude of minute openings, in connection with a single large 

 anal opening. In one other respect the sponge is diflferent from and 

 more simplified than other animal types. Its digestion is 

 entire!}^ cellular. It has developed no organ answering to the 

 stomach of other types. 



The sponge is, moreover, destitute of any organs of offense or 

 defense. Its nearest relatives, the polyps, have their tentacles 

 and thread -cells, in connection with a single aperture, which is 

 both oral and anal in function, and with a digestion which is 

 intermediate between the cellular and the stomachal methods, 

 and can be properly classed with neither. 



The method of obtaining food, by the aid of water currents, is 

 not peculiar to the sponge. It ma}' be found in other animal 

 types, such as the bivalve mollusks, the Tunicata, Aviphioxus, 

 etc. But in the sponge it is far more simplified than in these 

 higher forms. In the case of the mollusks, the water current is 

 confined to the branchifp, and onl}^ its food particles are taken 

 into the intestine. In the Tunicates and in Amphioxus respira- 

 tion is intestinal, but the water current is confined to the 

 branchial half of the intestine, while its food particles enter the 

 stomachal half, where tliey undergo digestion. In the sponge 

 the water currents permeate ever^^ portion of the body, and 

 respiration, as well as digestion, is a function of the separate 

 3 




26 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



cells. Thus the most interior regions of the organism are 

 visited by this water current and its contents. 



Of all animal types, therefore, that of the sponge is least pro- 

 tected by defensive appliances. There is nothing in tlie make-up 

 of the organism to prevent enemies from entering and penetrat- 

 ing to every portion of the body. They cannot be confined to 

 an intestinal tube, and exposed to the action of its digestive 

 juices, as in most organisms, but the whole interior of the body 

 is open to assault. 



Yet the evolution and long-continued existence of the sponge 

 type is evidence that it has possessed some defensive adaptation. 

 This adaptation, in its original phase at least, I take to be the 

 peculiar system of inhalent and exhalent apertures. It is evident 

 that the entrance of the water currents at the large aperture 

 would greatly facilitate the entrance of the foes of the sponge, 

 since they would be drawn from a distance and carried into the 

 body on these currents. As it is, the currents enter at minute 

 apertures, onl^^ adapted to the passage of microscopic food par- 

 ticles, and closing completely when not in use. The spicules 

 may also act defensively, to prevent any larger creature from 

 forcing an entrance at these oral apertures. 



On the other hand, there is a strong current of outflow from 

 the large aperture, well adapted to drive awiay the foes of the 

 sponge, unless possessed of considerable swimming power. In 

 this fact we seem to have an explanation of the peculiar organi- 

 zation of the sponge. The primeval ancestors of the Coelen- 

 terates probably developed in two directions. In one type tenta- 

 cles and thread-cells appeared, the oral opening was defended, 

 and the internal cavity took on the function of an incipient 

 stomach. In the other type the simple gastrula form was 

 retained, and water was drawn in by ciliary action through pores 

 in its cellular wall, and discharged at the mouth opening, after 

 yielding its food particles to the individual cells. Thus a multi- 

 tude of minute currents were combined into a single protective 

 outflowing current of considerable strength. 



This formation seems beneficial to the sponge from an aggres- 

 sive as well as from a defensive point of view. The extension of 

 the oral apertures over the whole surface of the body very con- 

 siderably increases the water space from which food particles are 

 drawn in, and thus may add materially to the lood supply. As 




1886,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 27 



the microscopic creatures which serve the sponge for food are 

 somewhat thinl}'^ disseminated, this extension of the space swept 

 by the inflowing currents is certainly an advantage. 



These remarks, however, are intended to apply principally to 

 the primitive sponge. In the earliest stage of this type of 

 organism it probably lacked the spicular and fibrous defenses 

 now possessed, and was but a step above the simple gastrula. At 

 this remote era, however, it is probable that muscular action had 

 not yet been evolved, and that cilia formed the only agents of 

 animal motion. Against creatures swimming by aid of cilia the 

 water current of the sponge must have been fully efficacious as a 

 defense. The development of the fibrous framework, and of 

 the pointed spicules, was probably a subsequent adaptation to 

 meet new dangers, after muscular organs of motion had been 

 evolved. At present prowling animals have no difficulty in 

 making their way to the interior of the sponge. The spicule is 

 now probably its most efficient defense, and the continued exist- 

 ence of the sponge type shows that it is sufficiently defended 

 against such animals as might seek to prey upon its protoplasmic 

 substance. 



I may offer, in conclusion, a further application of the hypoth- 

 esis presented in my former paper. The interaction of attack 

 and defense presents a feature of distinction between animals and 

 plants, in addition to those usually recognized. This distinction 

 I may briefly indicate. 



If we consider the defensive appliances of animals from a 

 general point of view, they may be reduced to two categories. 

 They are either mechanical or motor. These exist together, but 

 to the extent that the one method is developed, the other remains 

 undeveloped. If we take such an animal as the oyster, for 

 instance, we find that its defense is almost wholly mechanical. 

 Its only defensive motion is one of withdrawal within the shell. 

 If we take man, the defence is almost wholly motor. Scarcely a 

 trace of mechanical defense exists. In my former paper I spoke 

 also of mentality as a defensive attribute. But the defensive 

 action of the mind yields really a motor eff"ect. It simply pro- 

 duces more intricate and diversified motions, both in attack and 

 defense, than those displayed by unintelligent animals. 



If we examine the whole range of the animal kingdom, we find 

 every phase of combination of mechanical and motor defense, the 




28 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



motion growing more sluggish as the defensive armor grows 

 more efficient. But in the whole kingdom, motion persists as one 

 of the defensive agencies. No animal exists without some power 

 of motion, by whose aid it withdraws or otherwise escapes from 

 danger. 



In the plant kingdom, on the contrary, no defensive motion 

 exists. Mechanical defense exists alone. This does not applj^ to 

 those minute swimming organisms which lie near the root of the 

 plant and animal kingdoms. But in all the higlier plants no 

 motion exists, so far as I am aware, that is iiseful as a protection. 

 Thus the possession of protective motions by all animals, and 

 the lack of them by all plants, serve as a point of distinction 

 between the two kingdoms. 



In regard to aggressive motions, this rule does not so fully 

 hold good. All animals have aggressive motions. Nearly all 

 plants are destitute of them. Yet a few plants possess them. We 

 have instances of aggressive motions in the case of the creeping 

 Fungi, and of the Insectivorous plants. Yet apart from these 

 cases, the plant kingdom seems devoid of motions useful either 

 for attack or defense, and trusts wholly to mechanical appliances. 

 With the mechanical, however, must be included chemical appli- 

 ances, as in the case of poisonous or disagreeable juices. 



One more query remains. Why, in the early da3'S of the animal 

 kingdom, as known to us, was there such a marked tendenc}' to 

 trust to mechanical defense, while in the later era the tendency 

 has been towards motion as the main protective agent ? If we 

 consider the early conditions of animal life, this is not difficult 

 to comprehend. There is every reason to believe that the various 

 organs of animals were very slowly evolved. In a former com- 

 munication I have advanced the h^-pothesis that the early animals 

 were for a long time naked forms, partly, at least, through lack 

 of the evolution of glands necessary to produce hard coverings. 

 These early animals also moved by means of cilia only, if we can 

 trust the evidences from embryology, and from the lower existing 

 forms. The development of nerves and muscles was a very slow 

 process. The evolution of a form and of swimming organs giving 

 high efficiency to muscular action, was probably much slower. 

 The early animals possessed of muscles had probably a very 

 inefficient motor apparatus, and were very sluggish in their 

 movements. With the development of armor-producing power, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 29 



therefore, this seems to have been very generally employed as a 

 defense of the sluggish against such swifter moving carnivorous 

 animals as may have arisen. One great superiority of the verte- 

 brate type has always been the superior suitability of its form 

 and motor organs to swift movement, and it seems quite likely 

 that the great variety of mechanically defended lower forms in 

 the early fossiliferous beds, is due to the existence of swift- 

 moving antique vertebrates, which were themselves nearly or 

 quite destitute of hard parts, capable of preservation. Though 

 a later " struggle for existence," between vertebrates themselves, 

 caused the weakest and least active of these to develop armor, 

 yet it was succeeded by a general tendency in this type of life to 

 discard mechanical defenses, and trust to motion for protection. 

 The same has been the case with the actively aggressive members 

 of some of the lower types, such as the higher moUusks, which 

 have thrown off their armor, and developed other defensive appli- 

 ances. 



Throughout the whole history of the organic realm one prin- 

 ciple holds good. There has been a continued evolution of more 

 rapid and varied powers of motion. To this, every advance in 

 organization has tended, while the hindrances to speed and flexi- 

 bility have been successively discarded by the higher forms of 

 life. In correspondence with this has been the development of 

 mentality, since mentality, as outwardly displaj'^ed by the animals 

 below man, is indicated by a greater intricacy of motions, in 

 combination with ambush and concealment. For the attainment 

 of the highest possible speed and strength, little mentality was 

 requisite, and brain development is manifested rather by intricacy 

 than by speed of motion — or rather by that well-ordered correla- 

 tion of rest and diversified motion suited to the best good of 

 the organism. Yet we must regai'd mentality as rather the effect 

 than the cause of motor evolution. Probably the power of diver- 

 sified motion appeared first, while the exercise of an3^ new power 

 of this kind acted as an agent in the development of the brain. 

 In other words, the evolution of the brain is a consequence of 

 that of the body — not the reverse.

NEW SPECIES OF PARTUL&. FROM THE NEW HEBRIDES AND SOLOMON 



ISLANDS. 



BY W. D. HARTMAN, M. D. 



The new species of Partula herein described, are almost all of 

 one type. The shells of most species from the Solomon Islands 

 are thin, and more or less translucent, with numerous waved spiral 

 striae, a compressed umbilicus, a moderately reflected and concave 

 lip, and (when viewed through a glass) the embryonic whorls of 

 the apex are rounded or dome-shaped. Like other Partulse, indi- 

 viduals of the different species are often variable, especially' in 

 the greater or less obliquity of the aperture. These thin shells 

 possess so many features in common, that it is often difficult, in 

 the absence of illustrations, to frame a diagnosis sufficiently dis- 

 tinctive to enable the reader to recognize a species from the de- 

 scription alone. I have embraced the present opportunity to 

 figure a few species not heretofore delineated, amongst which is 

 the lost species, P. riifa, Lesson. 



This shell has been found on the banks of the Leila River, 

 Chabroul Harbor, TJhalan or Strong's Island, by Capt. Brazier, C. 

 M. Z. S. I have seen three examples. It is very distinct from P. 

 Guamensis, Pfr., with which it has been confounded ; the latter is 

 an arboreal species from Ponape, one of the Caroline group. 

 P. rufa, Less,, is a much smaller species than P. Guamensis, Pfr., 

 which it resembles in color, contour and texture. Farther explo- 

 rations in the New Hebrides and Solomon Islands will doubtless 

 reveal many new species of Partula.

 in the British Museum, or the Jardin des Plantes, and I have 

 only met with it twice in private collections. It differs from all

The posterior prolontjation of the tympanic elements which

 being- found in the space between the mastoid and the paramastoid 

 it is placed at the tip of the bones which enter into the composi-

An Extinct Boar from Florida. — Prof. Leidy exhibited a spe- 

 cimen consisting of two fragments of a tooth, which together are 

 over three inches long, and form the greater portion of the worni 



extremity of a, 

 lower tusk, with 

 the point bro- 

 ken off, appar- 

 ently of a liuge 

 suilline animal. 

 The fragments 

 were mingled 

 with other small 

 ones of tusks of 

 Mastodon flori-

 collected in Flo- 

 rida. The spe- 

 cimen nearly ac- 

 cords in shape 

 with the corres-

 the tusk of the 

 hog, but approx- 

 imates in pro- 

 portionate size 

 that of the hip- 

 popotamus. The 

 worn surface in 

 the entire tooth 

 has been about 

 three inches 

 long, and is an 

 inch wide. Thin 

 enamel invests 

 the tooth, ex-

 ing a short distance from the post-external border, the enamel is 

 defined by a sinuous edge, and appears to show that it ceased 

 about four inches from the point of the tooth, instead of extend- 

 ing the whole length of the tusk as in the hog. The anterior or 

 internal, and the posterior surfaces of the tooth are transversely 

 convex, and the external surface is convex and slightly flattened. 

 In transverse section the tooth is ovate, instead of triangular as 

 in the hog, the inner pole forming the sharp edge of the worn 

 surface. The surfaces of the tooth are smoother even than in 

 the hog, being less marked by longitudinal striae and transverse

lines of growth. They show no trace of the fluting in the tusk 

 of the hippopotamus, nor of the strong external ridge of tlie 

 peccary. The specimen is nearer in character to the tusk of the 

 hog than that of any other related animal, but is sufficiently dif- 

 ferent to render it probable that it ma_y pertain to another genus. 

 No undoubted remains of the genus Suh have yet been discovered 

 in America, and the same is the case with the genus Hippopot- 

 amus. The peccary appears to be the American representative 

 of the hog. The fossil may provisionally be referred to a new 

 genus, related with the latter, with the name of Eusyodon^ dis- 

 tinguishing the species as Eusyodon maximus. 



The transverse diameter of the section of the tusk, about three 

 inches from the point, is an inch and two-thirds ; and the fore and 

 aft diameter an inch and a quarter. 



Caries in the Mastodon. — Prof. Leidy directed attention to a 

 specimen consisting of the posterior portion of a last upper 

 molar tooth of the Mastodon, which he had attributed to a spe- 

 cies under the name of M. fioridanus. It is remarkable from 

 the circumstance that it apparently exhibits the result of caries, 

 a condition of which he had never previously observed an instance 

 in extinct animals. The supposed caries appears as an irregular 

 excavation immediately above the crown of the tooth, about four 

 lines in depth. The mouth of the cavity is elliptical, extending 

 one and one-fourth inches transversely, and one-fourth of an inch 

 vertically. The surface of the cavity appears irregularly eroded.

ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE OF STROMATOPORA AND ITS ALLIES. 

 BY DR. C. ROMINGER. 



I b.ad only i-eceutly the opportunity of reading the joint essay 

 by Prof. AUeyne Xicholson and Dr. F. Mnrie on the structure 

 of Stromatopora, published in 1879, in the Journal of the Linnsean 

 Society of London. The communication treats for the most part 

 to the structure of the Stromatoporas found on the American 

 continent. 



As I had paid attention for a number of years to the stud}' of 

 Stromafopora and had gathered extensive collections of them in 

 most of the localities from which the type specimens described 

 by these authors came, I had no difficulty in identifying the forms 

 they had under consideration. While I was enabled in this way 

 to confirm the correctness of some of their observations, I found 

 that in other instances they labored under erroneous conceptions, 

 partly because their material was insufficient, partly because they 

 did not recognize the things as they actually were. 



Of most of the forms described by them and of a number of 

 others I had over fifteen j-ears ago worked out descriptions, 

 accompanied b}' sixteen plates of magnified photographic figures, 

 intending to have them published under the auspices of the 

 Smithsonian Institution. Those to whom the paper was referred 

 for examination, however, reported adversely, in view of the recent 

 publication of Baron v. Rosen's monograph on Stromatopora and 

 the undesirability, as they believed, of issuing so man}'' plates 

 with such a comparatively small amount of text. 



Messrs. Nicholson and Murie commence with an historical expo- 

 sition of the diflferent opinions held by writers on the nature and 

 affinities of Stromatopora^ and after discussion of the arguments 

 for and against such opinions, they declare themselves with some 

 reserve in favor of the most popular of them, which was also held 

 by Goldfuss, the founder of the genus, that is to say, they think 

 the nearest relationship of Stromatopora is with the sponges having 

 a calcareous skeleton. The authors think they have recognized 

 in Stromatopora systems of channels destined for the circulation 

 of water to and from the organism, analogous to those permeating 

 the mass of sponges ; but we shall see hereafter that these supposed 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



water-channels are not a part of the organism, and prove on 

 accurate examination to be either accidental perforations of the 

 skeleton by boring animals, or else, are the stems of certain corals, 

 particularly of Syringopora, which have grown up simultaneously 

 with the Stromatopora, parasitically enveloping them. 



At the time I wrote the before-mentioned manuscript I also 

 believed a close affinity existed between the sponges and Stro- 

 Tnatopora, but since Carter and others have pointed out the simi- 

 larity existing between the calcareous skeleton of Hydractinia 

 and Stromatopoi^a I am convinced that the similarity between the 

 calcispongise and Stromatopora is merely an external one. The 

 mode of growth and organization of the sponges essentially differs 

 from that of Stromatojjora. The sponges are through their entire 

 mass permeated by a system of channels systematically arranged 

 so ks to make it evident that all parts of the sponge are destined 

 to perform simultaneously a vital function in the compound organ- 

 ism. There is nothing in their structure which could with pro- 

 priety be compared with the uniform periodicity in the growth of 

 a Stromatopora, which forms lajer alter layer in endless succes- 

 sion, one being the exact analogue of the other. The layers in 

 many instances are almost entirely shut off from communication 

 with the subjacent poftion of the laminated skeleton. We have 

 to Infer, therefore, that the live portion of a Stromatopora was 

 confined to the uppermost superficial strata, while the interlaminar 

 cell-spaces towards the interior gradually were abandoned and 

 became dead portions of the skeleton, as is the case with the skel- 

 etons of Hydractinia, and genex*ally with all true corals produc- 

 ing a calcareous stony skeleton. 



In a second chapter the authors give the characteristics of 

 Stromatopora, considering as type of the genus the Goldfussian 

 species Str. concentrica and polymorpha, both found in the Eifel, 

 Germany. 



Their description reads : " Stromatopora is composed of a suc- 

 cession of thin, close-set laminae, arranged concentrieall}' round 

 one or more imaginary centres. These concentric fundamentally 

 horizontal laminaj are separated by interspaces, which are crossed 

 by more or less numerous vertical pillars ; hence the vertical sec- 

 tion of a Stromatopora exhibits a number of approximately hori- 

 zontal layers and intervening spaces, the latter divided by upright 

 pillars into a number of vesicular compartments. The entire lami- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41 



nated mass has sometimes grown as an incrustation of a central 

 nucleus, a shell or coral ; other times it forms a more or less thick 

 expansion with a small point of attachment, and otherwise a free 

 underface covered b}^ a wrinkled dense epithelial crust." 



After this, in a general way correct description, they discuss 

 the original nature of the hard structures of Stromatoporoids, 

 which in fossilized condition are found calcareous, other times 

 siliceous, or partially calcareous and partially siliceous; and demon- 

 strate the originally calcareous nature of the ske.eton of Stroma- 

 topora particularly by the circumstance that the specimens ot 

 Siromatopora are always found in a calcareous condition, when 

 the associated fossils are likewise calcareous ; but if the associated 

 primitively calcareous fossils are to any large proportion silicified, 

 then also the skeletons of Stromatopora are found more or less 

 completely silicified. The various modes of preservation are 

 then "enumerated : a, skeleton wholly calcareous; 6, skeleton 

 calcareous, interlaminar spaces infiltrated with silica ; c, skeleton 

 silicified but the interlaminar spaces infiltrated with calcite ; cZ, 

 both former conditions of preservation represented in one and the 

 same specimen ; e, both skeleton and interlaminar spaces trans- 

 formed and filled with silica. 



Entering into description of the more minute particulars of the 

 structure of Stromatopora the writers state that of the before- 

 mentioned pillars not all reach from lamina to lamina, but that 

 rudimentary shorter ones occur between. The pillars and laminae 

 are represented as composed of granular carbonate of lime, which 

 shows no structure, except occasionally an indistinct indication 

 of reticulation. According to my own observation, in all well- 

 preserved calcareous specimens of Stromatopora^ the substance 

 of the laminae and of the pillars, being composed of a network of 

 interwoven delicate fibres, can be recognized with the greatest 

 distinctness, with a good simple lens, although not so distinctly 

 with the higher powers of a microscope, both the organic structure 

 and the crystalline mineral structure then becoming visible, thus 

 causing a blurred image. 



The pillars are described as either simple rounded prominences 

 or else as vermicular and anastomosing crests which are imperfor- 

 ate, solid, not tubular. The writers, however, observed on the 

 surface of weathered silicified specimens sometimes a part of the 

 exposed pillars perforated by a central opening, which they try 



4 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



to explain by an incomplete silicification of the central portion 

 of these pillars and by subsequent lixiviation of the unchanged 

 calcareous centre on exposure to atmospheric influences. 



I have, likewise, frequently observed a central perforation of 

 cross-fractured pillars in calcareous, as well as in silicified speci- 

 mens, but while I perfectly agree with their representation of the 

 pillars as generally being solid, not tubular, I do not think that 

 the central perforation of the pillars in the mentioned cases is 

 the result of weathering of the imperfectly silicified skeleton 

 substance. I believe it is caused b}^ funnel-shaped inflexions of 

 the laminge at the base of these pillars, which excavation shows 

 itself as a central opening, if the apical part of the pillars which 

 is solid is broken off". 



The laminae of some forms of Stromatopora, such as tuberculata, 

 and granulata of Nicholson, are described as continuous leaves, 

 without any visible perforations placing the superimposed inter- 

 laminar spaces in communication. It may be suggested that such 

 openings of communication may exist. I had frequently occasion 

 to observe this to be the case, although, in many instances, the 

 laminae of these species of Stromatopora appeared perfectly free 

 of larger perforations than the minute pores of the tissue itself. 

 In other forms, such as Strom, nodulata, and densa, the exist- 

 ence of such larger openings for communication between the 

 superimposed interlaminar spaces has been recognized by the 

 writers. 



According to my own observations, a part of these pores of 

 communication, and at the same time the largest ones, can be deter- 

 mined to be portions of the ramified horizontal channel expansions 

 radially converging towards certain centres, and uniting there in 

 one larger central canal, ascending verticall}'. These horizontal 

 canals in their extension slowly ascend from one interlaminar 

 space into another. They have, as Messrs. Nicholson and Murie 

 correctly observed, no proper walls, and cannot be considered as 

 canals horizontally intersecting the substance of the laminae, but 

 with more proprietv are described as furrows on the surface of 

 the laminae, which, finally, by the formation of a new lamina above 

 the older one, become roofed over and are transformed into closed 

 tubular spaces. This opinion I fully indorse. 



All Stromatoporas do not exhibit such radical channel expan- 

 sions well developed, but faint indications of radially arranged 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



furrows converging to certain centres can be discovered in almost 

 ever}' form of Stromafopora if we examine a sufficient number of 

 well-preserved specimens. Certain forms show them always most 

 beautifully, particularly those in which the tissue of the lamellae 

 and the ])illars has an open porous texture, which increases their 

 bulk, and diminishes the size of the interstitial spaces propor- 

 tionately. These forms have been pointed out by Winchell under 

 the generic name of Coenostroma, vchich distinction is not accepted 

 by Messrs. Nicholson and Murie, as the principal generic charac- 

 ter of Coenostroma is said to be the occurrence of the radial 

 channel expansions which, being present in forms of xery different 

 affinitives, cannot, in their opinion, be used as a generic mark. 

 This is, in one wa}^ true ; but if we consider that the forms com- 

 prehended under Coenostroma are distinguished not only by their 

 radiated surface, but by the before-mentioned bulkiness of their 

 laminae and pillars, and the minuteness of the intei'laminar cavi- 

 ties, from the ordinary typical forms of Stromatopora, which have 

 compact, well-defined laminae and pillars, I think these two 

 characters combined allow a subdivision of Stromatopora into 

 two groups, which at the first glance are distinguishable by even 

 an inexperienced observer, although, as I admit, numerous tran- 

 sitory grades from one group to the other exist, which make it 

 difficult to draw a line of demarkation between them. 



The characters by which Prof. Nicholson distinguishes Stylo- 

 diclyon from Stromatopora most assuredl}' stand on a weaker basis 

 than those of Winchell's Coenostroma^ as I will demonstrate here- 

 after when Messrs. Nicholson and Murie 's newly created genera 

 are reviewed. 



After having described these radiating horizontal!}' expanded 

 channels, the authors give a description of certain so-called 

 vertical water canals, observed in many different forms of Stro- 

 matopora. 



There are two essentially different kinds of such canals verti- 

 cally traversing the laminated masses, and considered by the 

 authors as parts of the organism. In one of the cases we find 

 the mass of the Stromatopora perforated by comparatively large, 

 generally round, but sometimes elliptical canals, which have no 

 walls for themselves, and are evidently perforations by borino- 

 animals. The nature of the channels and their totally irregular 

 distribution in the masses, proves this in a large number of spe- 

 cimens examined by me. 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



As representing this kind of channels, or oscula, as they term 

 them, the authors mention tlie following forms : Stromatopora 

 striafella, Hindei, tuberculata^ ponderosa, and ostiolata. In the 

 first four mentioned forms, the true nature of these perfora- 

 tions is without difficulty demonstrable. In St. ostiolata.^ of which 

 si^ecimens from Guelph, Canada, are transformed into a coarsely 

 crystalline dolomite, the organic structure of these masses can 

 scarcely be ascertained, and it is impossible to decide definitely 

 on the nature of the tubular casts traversing them. One of the 

 other examples mentioned, the so-called Stromatopora Hindei, is 

 unfortunately selected, as it is in reality an Alveolites, perforated 

 by some boring animal. The figures and description given leave 

 no doubt as to this point. Similar silicified specimens are, more- 

 over, not rarely met with in the Niagara group of Michigan. 



The second kind of vertical tubular channels supposed to hav^e 

 the function of conducting water through the organism of Stro- 

 matopora has distinct walls with imbricating wrinkles of growth 

 on the outside, and frequently from their interior a circle of 

 longitudinal rows of spinules projects ; more rarely invaginated 

 funnel-shaped diaphragms interrupting the tube-channels can be 

 observed, all of which proves that we have before us inclosed 

 stems of a Syringopora and not canals making part of the skele- 

 ton of the associated Stromatopora. Specimens of each are quite 

 abundant in the Devonian strata of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, 

 and Canada. Some pebbles found on the shoi-e of Lake Superior 

 represent the same parasitical investment of clusters of Syringo- 

 pora stems on Stromatopora. 



In the Niagara group we also find various kinds of Stromato- 

 pora similarly intergrown with stems of a delicate Syringopora, 

 which I have described in the Michigan Geological reports under 

 the name Syringopora filiformis. In other cases we find colonies 

 of Dijjhyphyllum multicaule invested in the same way by Stroma- 

 topora. 



In this connection also Stromatocerium of Hall is cited by the 

 authors as an example of the first class of vertical water canals, 

 without any proper walls. In a chapter headed ^^ Dejiartures from 

 the Ordinary Type of Stromatopora,^^ as the first of these, Stroma- 

 tocerium is enumerated, and the following description given : "It 

 has the general aspect of Stromatopora, and possesses crowded con- 

 centric laminae characteristic for Stromatoporoids. The laminae are 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45 



of considerable thickness, and are separated as usual by well- 

 marked interlaminar spaces, but the latter are quite open, and 

 there is a total absence of the vertical calcareous pillars which 

 occur in the normal Stromatoporoids; but the whole mass is per- 

 forated by innumerable vertical canals, which are destitute of 

 walls, and open directly into the successive interlaminar spiices 

 which they penetrate, as well as into open irregular laminae in 

 the general laminated skeleton." 



This is an erroneous conception of the structure of that family, 

 as these supposed tubules are in reality casts of actual solid 

 tissue pillars which vertically intersect the laminated mass, some- 

 times without interruption in the different intersected layers, 

 sometimes in each band (consisting of a group of subordinate 

 delicate layers), these pillars start anew from a fresh basis. 



The ordinary mode of preservation of the fossil has generally 

 impaired the original organic texture of the skeleton, which 

 became almost totally destroyed, and the space occupied by tissue 

 mass filled with transparent crystalline carbonate of lime, while 

 the former vesicular interlaminar interstices were replenished 

 with turbid, milky dolomite. Sections through such specimens 

 in vertical direction, show the transparent casts of the tissue 

 pillars as tubular channels, and in horizontal sections the same 

 appear to be circular orifices surrounded by a massive interstitial 

 wall substance, 



Silicified specimens occasionally occur in which the interlaminar 

 spaces filled with silica are the only part preserved, while the 

 actual skeleton has been removed by solvents, and the space once 

 occupied by it remaining hollow, we then see the mass intersected 

 by innumerable small circular channels. 



I had the good fortune to find in the drift of Ann Arbor some 

 calcareous specimens in which the original tissue mass is pre- 

 served, represented by a non-transparent, dull, calcareous matter, 

 while the cellulose interlaminar interstices are replenished with 

 clear, transparent carbonate of lime. 



They consist of a succession of thick, concentrically superim- 

 posed, undulating and monticulose laj'ers from two to six milli- 

 meters in thickness, which are generally demarkated from 

 one another by darker colored division lines of greater density 

 than the remainder of the lamina. Each such larger lamina 

 represents a certain uninterrupted period of growth during 




46 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADExMY OP [1886. 



which, beginning from a solid basal leaf, densel}' crowded with 

 papillose prominences, delicate versiculous plates are formed at 

 short intervals, connecting into a floor which bridges over 

 the tops of these papilli, which are prolonged until another 

 floor spreads over their apices, and until from six to twelve of 

 these subordinate laminae had formed, inclosing between them 

 versicular cell-spaces. Then after an evident interruption in the 

 uniform progress of growth, a new one of the larger layers com- 

 posed of subordinate laminae, commenced to form on top of the 

 other. The pillars intersecting the laminae subordinate to a larger 

 bandlike layer form uninterrupted columelles which usually 

 correspond with those of the next succeeding layers or bands. 

 In other cases, however, the columellae or pillars of each one of 

 the thicker compound laminae are independent in their position, 

 and do not correspond. Some of these pillars are often much 

 stouter than the others, and divide iuto several mammiform side 

 branches. The majority of them are simple, rounded, or later- 

 ally compressed into vermicular crests, particularly so in the 

 circumference of the monticulose prominences of the surface, 

 where these crests radially converge towards the centre, resem- 

 bling the horizontal radially converging channel expansions of an 

 ordinary Stromatopora, but in this case it is the tissue-mass, and 

 not the intervening furrows, which produces the vermicular 

 radiating converging lines. The interstitial cell-spaces inclosed 

 between the convex transverse leaflets bridging over the space 

 from pillar to pillar, are very similar to the convex vesicules in 

 a vertical section of a Gyatijohyllum. As above stated in the 

 majority of specimens occurring abundantly in the Trenton 

 group of Escanaba River, and at Nashville, Tennessee, and 

 also in the drift of Ann Arbor and in the upper part of the 

 Cincinnati group at Madison, Indiana, the actual skeleton sub- 

 stance is almost completely destroyed, and its place filled with 

 crystalline carbonate of lime. It often occurs that several of the 

 thick bandlike layers are composed of a succession of vesiculose 

 layers twice or three times the size of the vesicules composing 

 other layers of the same specimens. In this case the vertical 

 pillars become very obscure, so that the whole appears as an 

 indiscriminate accumulation of vesicules as large as those of an 

 ordinary Gystiphyllum. 



The surface of Stromatocerium was not known to Messrs. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 47 



Nicholson and Murie. I have seen manj' specimens with a sur- 

 face covered b^' rounded monticules similar to those of Stromato- 

 pora monticulifera^ Winchell, and the tops of these monticules • 

 radiated by the convergence of the before-mentioned compressed 

 vermiform crests representing the pillars of an ordinarj- Stro- 

 matopora. I had photographic representations of such natural 

 surfaces on the plates pertaining to my old manuscript essay on 

 Stromatopiora^ besides figures of vertical sections which exhibit 

 the structure better than any description can do it. 



As a second aberrant form of Stromatoporoids the authors 

 pointed out a form to which they gave the name Pachydroma. 



The t3'pe form occurs in the Niagara group and is described as 

 consisting of subhemispherical masses formed of a concentric 

 succession of very thick laminje from one to two lines in diameter, 

 which are in direct contrast, not separated by inter-laminar 

 spaces except occasionally by narrow irregular intervals, conse- 

 quently there are also no radial pillars. Under the microscope 

 the great laminae are formed of an indistinct porous calcareous 

 tissue principally composed of irregular vertical fibres jjlaced at 

 some distance from one another, and onl}^ clearly brought to view 

 by the use of polarized light. Numerous delicate but irregular, 

 generally remote vertical vermicular tubules without distinct 

 walls are said to perforate the mass, but such pores could not be 

 discovered on fractured surfaces by the use of a simple lens. 

 The surface of weathered specimens also shows radiating branched 

 subdermal canals placed round numerous independent centres, 

 precisely' as in the so-called Coenostroma. 



Several figures of sections through Pachystrovia are given, 

 which, together with the above description, convince me that the 

 authors had under observation imperfectly preserved specimens 

 of Stromatopora, which occur abundantl}^ in the Niagara group ; 

 those found in the A'icinity of Lockport in calcified condition, 

 particularly correspond with the given descriptions. They have 

 generally lost the finer structure, but exhibit distinctly a compo- 

 sition of concentrically superimposed bands consisting of an 

 almost structureless, compact, calcareous mass, cut into thin 

 slices, showing under the microscope the above described fibrous 

 texture. 



On examination of a good many specimens exceptionally a spot 

 may be found in which the structure is better preserved, and in 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



those I can see that each one of the described large, thick laminae 

 consists of a number of delicate subordinate laminae, separated as 

 usual by minute interlaminar spaces, intersected with pillars. 

 In my opinion, therefore, the so-called Pachy stroma merely repre- 

 sents a certain imperfect state of preservation of several of the 

 ordinary species of Stromatopora found in the Niagara group. 

 The grouping of the smaller structural elements into broader 

 bands is almost universally the rule in Stromatopora. Any ver- 

 tical section almost, in which the delicate laminae and interstitial 

 spaces alternate through the whole thickness of the mass with 

 great uniformity, will, if we direct our attention to it, show a 

 grouping of a number of such laminse into one broader, occa- 

 sionally narrower bands, discernible b};- a darker shade of color 

 on the junction line of two of such bands. It indicates tempo- 

 rary short interruptions in the regularity of the progressing 

 growth, as I have intimated previously, while giving a description 

 of the structure of Stromatocerium. 



Prof. Nicholson considers also Stromatopora densa of the Hel- 

 derberg group as a representative of his Pachystroma, but of this 

 form I can most positively assert that its structure does not differ 

 in any respect from the typical forms of Stromatopora. 



The specimens before me allow the recognition of the regular 

 superposition of laminae, supported by galleries of short, stout 

 pillars with greatest distinctness ; the orifices of the horizontal 

 channel expansions are in vertical sections, rather large, and the 

 ordinary interlaminar cell-spaces unusually small, which causes 

 the compactness and apparent density of the mass, as compared 

 with the open porous appearance of sections of other associated 

 forms of Stromatopora, the commonest of which is Stromato- 

 pora ponderosa, Nicholson. This latter form I had years ago dis- 

 tributed among my scientific friends under the name of Stroma- 

 topora tentilis, on account of its most elegant reticulated 

 appearance in vertical sections. In this respect it exceeds in 

 distinctness any other form of Stromatopora known to me. 



A third group of Stromatoporoids, aberrant from the ordinary 

 type, Mr. Nicholson named Clathrodiclyon. T% is distinguished 

 from the type form by the flexuose course of the lamellae com- 

 posing the laminated section. They are continually turned up 

 and downward, the upturned portions representing the vertical 

 pillars of ordinary forms of Stromatopora. The interlaminar 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 49 



spaces, therefore, appear as layers of rounded or elongated vesic- 

 ules somewhat resembling the tissue of Gystiphyllum on a minute 

 scale. Forms of this structure occur abundantly in the Niagara 

 group and some in the Devonian strata. 



A generic distinction of these forms, represented in many dif- 

 ferent modifications, can, in my opinion, be made with propriety, 

 but as intermediate forms occur, in which the laraellse are only 

 little disturbed in their straight course by the inflexions repre- 

 senting the interstitial pillars, it is difficult to draw a line separ- 

 ating Glathrodictyon from Stromatopora. 



Prof. Nicholson's tj'^pe form of Glathrodictyon, occurring in 

 the Niagara group, is described as forming large cake-like expan- 

 sions from one to two inches in thickness centrally, but thinning 

 out near the margins. Upper face irregularly undulating and 

 exfoliating concentrically round elevated points. Surface smooth. 

 Internal structure exceedingly delicate, formed of fine close-set, 

 horizontal or slightly undulating laminse, of which about twenty 

 to twenty-five occupy the space of one line. Interlaminar spaces 

 divided into minute lenticular cells formed by curved inflexions 

 of the horizontal laminje. 



Specimens to which, in a general way, this description is ap- 

 plicable, are common in the Niagara group of Michigan, Kentucky 

 and Iowa, but although a good many hundreds came under my 

 observation I could never find one whose structure was so minute 

 as to exhibit from twenty to twenty-five laminae on the space of 

 one line. The most delicately built among my specimens had not 

 over sixteen within the space of a line. 



The form having this delicate structure I had, in my above- 

 mentioned essa}' on Stromatopora, described and figured under 

 the name Stromatopora minuta. Its structure does not repre- 

 sent the character of Glathrodictyon in its most perfect develop- 

 ment, as the lamellae, which by their inflexion form the pillars, 

 are not much twisted out of their rectilinear general direction, and 

 as a number of pillars are observable in such sections which are 

 papillose prominences of the surface of the lamellae, not showing 

 any inflexion of the latter at their base. 



Associated with this form are several other forms of much 

 coarser structure with from six to eight lamellae within the space 

 of one line, which exhibit the clathrodictjon character in much 

 more ideal perfection than the type form does. These had been 




50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



described in my before-mentioned essay under the name of Stro- 

 matopora vesiculosa^ as their vertical sections appear as an accu- 

 mulation of layers of cystose cells, rather than as a succession of 

 continuous laminae, separated by interstitial spaces. The demar- 

 kating walls of the cells appear in vertical sections as the meshes 

 of a net-work bounded by lines diagonally intersecting the direc- 

 tion which the laminae should have if they formed continuous 

 leaves. In some of these specimens a banded structure is observ- 

 able, whereby from five to eight layers of vesicules are grouped 

 together to form a broader band, which then is sharply defined bj^ 

 a straight continuous division line from the adjoining similar 

 bands above and below it. 



Other specimens of this vesiculose species of Stromatopora 

 are found intergrown with stems of Syringopora filiformis, 

 sometimes also with stems of Diphyphyllum multicaule, exactly 

 in the same manner as in the previoiisl}^ mentioned Devonian 

 forms, which have been subordinated b}^ the authors to Gauno- 

 pora, supposing the enveloped stems to be part of the skeleton 

 of Stromatopora. 



Among the Devonian representatives of his genus Glathro- 

 dictyon^ Mr. Nicholson describes, under the name C. cellulosum, 

 a form which I had in my paper named Stromal, cellulifera. It 

 occurs in the corniferous limestone of Port Colborne and else- 

 where, in association with another form which I called Sir. 

 invaginata, but which, it seems, did not come under his observa- 

 tion. C. cellulosum is described as gi^owing in irregular expan- 

 sions of considerable size, formed of a succession of horizontal 

 lamellae, about four occupying the space of one line, and so 

 inflected as to form complete or incomplete partitions, which 

 divide the interlaminar spaces into a number of irregularly oval 

 vesicules, about three occupying one line. Surface tuberculated 

 or granulated ; the tubercules occasionally perforated. In the 

 specimens found in the same localitv the surface, instead of 

 being tuberculated or granulated, as above described, is covered 

 with roof-like, elongated, laterally uniting crests, forming in this 

 way a network, enclosing shallow subpolygonal cell-pits, some- 

 what similar to the shallow pits of a minute compound star-coral, 

 as the margins of these crests on weathered silicified specimens, 

 being of porous texture, appear sometimes crenulated, which 

 crenulation increases the resemblance. The other form allied to 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 51 



Clathrodictyon which is not described by Prof. Nicholson, pre- 

 sents the weathered surfaces of the silicified specimens, covered 

 with very stout rounded conical papilli of almost uniform size, 

 about half a millimetre in diameter and twice that distance apart. 

 Apices of the not cross-fractured papilli imperforate. In a 

 vertical section four or five well-demarkated stout lamellas occupy 

 the space of two millimetres, which is approximately the same 

 as one line. The interlamellar pillars are formed by upward 

 flexions of the lamellse, and therefore we see the base of each 

 one excavated by an inverted funnel-shaped sinuosity ; and as 

 the pillars of the successive laminse correspond, the apices of the 

 pillars of the inferior laminae become invaginated into the basal 

 funnel-shaped excavation of the next ones above, which being 

 the case through the whole thickness of the laminated mass, 

 makes it appear as if so many vertical columns intersected it 

 transversely. This structure was observed by Mr. Nicholson in 

 another species of Stromatopora, and induced him to propose for 

 it the generic name Stylodictyon. 



The space between these pseudo-columns is bridged over by a 

 gentl}' downwai'd curved portion of the lamelhTe, leaving corres- 

 pondingly large elongated interlaminar spaces between them, which 

 often are subdivided by arched vesicular plates obliquely and 

 irregularly traversing them. The mode of growth of this form 

 is the same as that of the former species ; it occurs in thick undula- 

 ting expansions, covered by an epithecal crust on the under side. 

 An associate of these tw^o forms, which I had named Stroma- 

 tojJora explanafa, has been described by Prof. Nicholson under 

 the name of Stromatopora tuherculata. Its surface is crowded 

 with rather close-set, rounded papilli, somewhat differing in size. 

 Occasionally an arrangement of somewhat compressed, elongated 

 papilli, in radial order towards certain centres, is faintly indi- 

 cated, but rarel}^ becomes obviously developed. The lamellae are 

 stout, formed of a compact tissue-mass, in which distant perfora- 

 tions are observable, maintaining communication between the 

 superimposed interlaminar spaces. Five or six lamellae occupy 

 the space of one line, interstitial cell-spaces comparatively large, 

 oval or elongated to twice the amount of their height. The 

 course of the laminae is generally in straight parallel lines, but 

 we can often observe their upward inflection at the base of some 

 of the pillars. This produces in vertical sections of this form a 




52 PROCEEDINQS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



considerable resemblance to sections of Glathrodictyon cellulosum, 

 whose structure is somewhat coarser, having only four or five 

 lamellae within the space of a line, and more conspicuously 

 inflected in order to form pillars. 



As a fourth aberrant form of Stromatoporoids, a single speci- 

 men found in the upper Cincinnati group of Ohio is described 

 by the authors, about which I am unable to give an opinion of 

 my own, as from the rather vague description I caunot say that 

 anytliing similar ever was under my observation. 



After these expositions, a classification of the different types 

 of Stromatoporoids is attempted, and seven generic cadres are 

 proposed, most of which had been sketched already ia the 

 previous chapters. 



These proposed genera are: (1) Stromatopora Goldfuss, com- 

 prising all those forms consisting of concentrically superim- 

 posed laminae, each lamina separated from the other by a 

 distinct interlaminar space, which is crossed by numerous ver- 

 tical pillars. In some of these forms are radial, subhorizontal 

 canals or surface grooves placed round minor centres, which, 

 according to my own experience, are present in almost every 

 form of Stromatopora — at least, in rudimentary development. 

 In addition to these characters, large vertical canals intersecting 

 the laminated masses are described by the authors, which they 

 believe to be analogous to the oscula of sponges. I have to 

 reject this opinion as erroneous. 



(2). Caunopora Phillips. Type, Caunopora placenta. Repre- 

 sentative form of the authors' Stromatophora perforata. I need 

 not enter again into a discussion of the value of this generic 

 distinction, as I have previously proved that these forms do not 

 represent one organism, but are coral stems, parasitically iuA^ested 

 with various kinds of Stromatopora, which in the same localities 

 grew perfectly free of such enclosed stems, erroneously believed 

 to be parts of the organism. 



(3). Glathrodictyon Nicholson, likewise, has been sufficiently 

 taken into consideration. 



(4). Stylodictyon Nicholson, is represented by two species, St. 

 columnare and St. retiforme. Besides the general structure of 

 Stromatopora, as special character of this genus, it is asserted 

 that a system of vertical columns of dense calcareous tissue per- 

 vades the laminated skeleton. The concentric arrangement 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 58 



of the successive laminge and their interstices round these 

 vertical columns, is also brought forward as a noteworthy 

 circumstance. It is likewise stated that radiating channel 

 expansions may be present or not. I had described and figured 

 these two forms in my paper, under the name Stromatopora 

 Wortheni, thinking a division into two species superfluous, as 

 insensible gradations from one form into the other exist. 



The columellar streaks, seen to intersect the mass of this other- 

 wise typical form of Stromatopora in vertical sections, are pro- 

 duced by the repeated abrupt flexions of the lamellae in'o 

 papillose prominences which cover the surface, similar to those 

 we otfserve in manj- other forms of Stromatopora^ as for instance, 

 in Str. pustulifera Winchell. 



As in this latter form, the prominences are somewhat larger 

 and consequently the flexions are not so abrupt, and as the tissue 

 of this form is throughout more compact, we do not observe an 

 obvious contrast between the density of the parts corresponding 

 with the papillose prominences and the broader downward-curved 

 intermediate portions of the skeleton, while in the so-called 

 Stylodictyon, the abrupt flexions of the lamellas in the papilli 

 into an almost vertical direction, cause the closer approxima- 

 tion, and consequently greater density, of these parts than of 

 the intermediate gently downward -curved portions of the 

 laminated skeleton which have comparatively open, well-defined 

 interlaminar cell-spaces contrasting with the denser portions, so 

 as to let them appear under the form of vertical columns. 

 Examining transparent vertical sections of such specimens, we 

 see that the lamellffi are not interrupted in their continuity while 

 passing across these columellar streaks, and that no additional 

 tissue element comes into play, which could be claimed as con- 

 stituting the substance of the columelles. On the contrary, 

 every portion of these columellar streaks is identifiable either 

 as a normal part of the lamellae or of the intermediate system 

 of pillars. To mention among the generic characters the 

 concentric arrangement of the lamellae and their interstices 

 round these columellar centres, appears to me rather superfluous, 

 as it is a necessary consequence of the monticulose prominences 

 into which the surface is raised. I could invariably' observe in 

 all specimens of this tribe which came under my observation, 

 radial horizontal ducts, which, by the authors, are said to be 

 sometimes developed and sometimes not. 




54 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



The structure of the form called Stylodictyon columnare, found 

 in the Helderberg limestones of Kelley's Island, etc., is somewhat 

 more compact than we find it in the specimens of the Hamilton 

 group named retiforme, but there occur numerous transition 

 forms from the compact to a more open, porous structure. In 

 the size of the papillose prominences, also, a great variation of 

 forms exists. I think, therefore, we could well spare one specific 

 name and retain the one I had selected for both varieties jointly, 

 Stromatopora Wortheni. 



In the Helderberg limestones of Vernon, Indiana, and at the 

 Falls of Ohio, occurs a form of Stromatopora very similar in 

 structure with the former, but with columellar streaks ^much 

 smaller than in these, measuring only half a millimetre in 

 diameter, or little over. Its tissue mass is also more bulky, of 

 open reticulated spongious texture plainl}'^ recognizable with a 

 common hand magnifier. I had given in my manuscript descrip- 

 tion and figures of it, under the name Stromatopora granulifera, 

 as the papilli on its surface give it rather a granulated than ' 

 papillose aspect, on account of their smallness. Horizontal 

 radial ducts are well developed in this form. In it and in the 

 former species these ducts unite in more or less distant centres, 

 which are totally independent of the papillose prominences of 

 the surface, while in many other forms of Stromaiopora^ as for 

 instance, in monticulifera and pustulifera Winchell, the apex of 

 each of these monticulose elevations is also the centre of conver- 

 gence for such channels. 



Under Nos. 5 and 6, generic descriptions of Stromatocerium 

 and of Pachystroma are given, which require no further critical 

 comment, as I have on a pre\ious page sufliciently expressed my 

 views on the correctness of the emended characteristic of Stro- 

 matocerium and of the merits of the distinction of Pachystroma. 



As a seventh generic form of Stromatoporoids a certain con- 

 centrically' laminated fossil found in the Niagara limestone of 

 Louisville, K3^, has been described by Mr. Nicholson under the 

 name Dictyostroma^ which has nothing in common with the 

 Stromatoporoid tribe, excepting an external- resemblance, being 

 composed of a succession of laminae separated by large inter- 

 stices. The upper surface of these laminse is covered with 

 spiniform prominences, part of which are long enough to reach 

 the bottom of the superincumbent lamella ; others are shorter. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF I'HILAbELPHIA. 55 



These numerous processes vertically intersecting the inter- 

 lamellar spaces increase the resemblance of these fossils to 

 Stromatopora. Each of the undulating superimposed laminae, 

 of not quite one millimetre in thickness, and about from one to 

 three millimetres distant from one another, is composed of a 

 layer of horizontally prostrate tubules with solid intimately 

 united walls, which after some extent in the horizontal position, 

 abruptly bend hpward and open on the surface of the laminae 

 with oblique compressed orifices bordered on the outside either 

 by a sharp lip, or by a vertically rising strong proboscidal pro- 

 longation, similar to the pillars on the surface of the lamellae of 

 a StromatojDora. The underside of each one of these lamellje in 

 the concentric succession, is covered by a wrinkled epithecal 

 crust, through which the outlines of the single tubules compos- 

 ing the lamella are plainl}^ visible, just as we see it on the under- 

 side of foliaceous expansions of Alveolites, and indeed, the 

 structure of this fossil in every respect corresponds with the 

 structure of Alveolites or Limaria, and has no analogy whatever 

 with Stromatopora. 



As the numerous specimens I possess of this fossil were not 

 only found in the same locality from which Prof. Nicholson's 

 type specimen comes, but were collected at the same time when 

 Rev. Mr. Herzer picked up the specimen now in possession of 

 Prof. Orton, of Ohio, I am positive that the objects I have under 

 consideration are identical with Prof. Nicholson's type specimen. 

 A very similar concentrically laminated fossil, but on the 

 whole of coarser structure, with interlaminar spaces from three 

 to five millimetres in width and with very stout intervening 

 pillars is not rare in the drift deposits of Ann Arbor. The 

 specimens are silicified and the structure of the laminte, as 

 being composed of a layer of prostrate tubules, is no longer 

 recognizable. The wrinkled epithecal crust on the underside of 

 each lamina is, however, still well preserved. The pillars, if 

 broken through, exhibit sometimes a central channel ; the shorter 

 ones, not injured, are imperforate at the apex ; some of the larger 

 pillars divide into mammiform side branches. There remains 

 no doubt in my mind that this and the former Dictyostroma of 

 Nicholson belong to the tribe of Alveolites, Limaria, etc. I pro- 

 pose, therefore, for them the name of Alveolites stromatoporoides. 

 A genuine Stromatoporoid which in its external aspect has 




56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMV OF [1886. 



some resemblance to Mr. Nicholson's Dictyostroma^ is found at 

 the same locality at Louisville, but the descriptions given by 

 Nicholson, and his figures, sufficiently prove that it was not this 

 form which served him as a type for Dictyostroma. The rather 

 closely approximated laminae are inflected upwards to form stout 

 conical pillars with a funnel-shaped excavation at their base, 

 as in Clathrodictyon and in Stylodictyon of Nicholson. The 

 pillars of the superimposed laminae correspond, and the 

 apices of the lower pillars become invaginated into the basal 

 cavities of those above, whereby a sort of pseudo-columns are 

 formed which vertically intersect the entire thickness of the 

 masses, growing in flat expansions and covered with an epithecal 

 crust on the underside. A number of other interesting forms of 

 Stromatopora occur in the Niagara group, but as my present 

 intention is only a review of Messrs. Nicholson and Murie's 

 work, I abstain from their description on this occasion.

NOTES ON THE TEKTIARY GEOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY OF THE 

 SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. 



BY PROF. ANQELO HEILPRIN. 



Eocene of Texas. — In a limited collection of fossils from near 

 the northern border of San Augustine Co., Texas, transmitted to 

 me for examination by the Texas State Geological and Scientific 

 Association, I have been able to determine the following species : — 



Ostrea Alabamiensis. Cardita Blandingi (allicosta). 



Ostrea selktformis. Crassatella antestriata. 



Ostrea divaricata. Corhula Texana. 



Pecten Deshayesii. Buccitriton altile? (Texana). 



Anomia ? Scalaria sp. indet. 



The horizon represented is evidently the " Claibornian," the 

 deposits probably occupying a position in the " Jacksonian " 

 area. 



The Nummulitic of Florida. — Prof. G. A. Wetherby, of Cin- 

 cinnati, has furnished me with a number of rock fragments ob- 

 tained at a locality some six miles southwest of Gainesville, Fla. 

 They are interesting as containing, in addition to one or more 

 species of Orbitoides, several nearly perfect individuals of Num- 

 mulites Floridanus Heilprin, which, therefore, represent the most 

 northern localit}' in the State where the members of this group 

 of Foraminifera have thus far been found. They lend further 

 confirmation to the views already advanced by the writer as to 

 the broad extent of the southern Nummulitic formation, and to 

 the relative antiquity of the Floridan peninsula. One consider- 

 able fragment of a Heterostegina is also represented in the rock. 



Since the receipt of Prof. Wetherby's specimens I have been 

 favored, through Mr. Joseph Willcox, of this cit}^, with other 

 fragments from approximately the same locality, Arredonda, 

 Alachua Co., which also contain Nummulites Floridanus^ Orhi- 

 toides, and Operculina rotella (0. complanata?). 



Eocene of Kentucky. — Mr. R. H. Loughridge has kindly for- 

 warded to me for determination a number of fossils collected by 

 the Geological Survey of Kentucky, from the immediate neigh- 

 borhood of Paducah. They are mainl}- in the form of casts in a 

 highly ferruginous and fairly micaceous yellow-white sandstone, 

 5

and in the most part recognizable only in so far as the determina- 

 tion of genera is concerned. 



The species are referable to the following genera : — 



Mysia — species probably M. unguUna. 

 Leda — species probably Z. protexta. 

 Leda — species indet. 

 Nucula — species probably N. ovula. 

 Turritella — species Turritella Mortoni. 



This is, as far as I am aware, the first notification of the dis- 

 covery of marine fossils in the Tertiary deposits of the State. 

 The presence of the strongly carinate form of Turritella Mortoni 

 fixes pretty definitely the horizon, the Lower Eocene, or that of 

 the older Tertiaries of Maryland and Virginia. This is what we 

 should have expected to find from the position of the strata.

Botanical Notes : — Secretion of Nectar in Lihonia. — At the 

 meeting of the Botanical Section, on the 8th instant, Mr, Thomas 

 Meehan reraarlced that the Brazilian Acanthaceous plant, Lihonia^ 

 secreted an enormous amount of nectar at the base of the flowers. 

 As the corollas faded, and dropped from the receptacle, the nectar 

 would be drawn over the still fresh pistil, and leave it with a 

 succession of small globules, the whole shining like a necklace of 

 diamonds in the sun. In a state of nature, honey-collecting insects 

 would doubtless not permit it to accumulate to this extent. 



Production of Nectar in Ornithogaluvi coarctatum. — This pretty 

 species is distinguished by the development of broad sheathing 

 stipular appendages at the base of the inner series of three stamens, 

 stipular appendages as, following Mr. Worthington G. Smith, 

 in a paper contributed to the Horticultural Congress in London 

 in 1865, we must feel bound to term them. These appendages 

 were closely appressed against the ovarium. Noticing little 

 brownish globules projecting above the edges of these appendages 

 he was led to examine, and found that nectar was secreted only at 

 the base of the stipulate stamens. It was produced in such quan- 

 tity as to press upwards and above the edges, as alread}^ noted. 

 It was of thick consistence, and with the exact odor of honey. 

 Above or near the apex of the ovarium — at the base of the short 

 style — nectar exuded in limited quantit)^, and this suggested an 

 analogy between the morphology of the carpellary leaves and the 

 stipular filaments. 



Mr. Meehan further remarked on the production of stipular 

 appendages by the petals of flowers as accounted for by Mr. 

 Worthington Smith. In one of his earliest contributions to the 

 Proceedings of the Academy he had shown that in Magnolia the 

 petals were formed by the suppression of the laminal portions 

 and the development of the stipules. The petals were indeed 




60 PROCEEDINGS OE THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



modified stipules, not true leaves. The petals of roses were cer- 

 tainly modified stipules, and this process of development could 

 be traced in many plants. In this species of Ornithogalum there 

 is but a slight dilation at the base of the outer whorl of stamens. 

 A great advance is made in the stipular development in the 

 inner whorl of stamens, where the appendages extend half-way 

 up the filament. The three carpellary leaves formed the next 

 whorl, and we might reasonably imagine a greater development 

 of the stipular energy in a succeeding whorl, and therefore that 

 these carpels were also enlarged stipules. An absolute proof of 

 this was afl^orded by one plant, which had the habit of producing 

 some flowers with an union evident from the phyllotaxy, of an 

 outer petal (or sepal) with a stamen of the inner verticil. In this 

 case the staminoid petal took the shape of the stipule, that is to 

 say, it was emarginate, or inversely saggitate at the apex, tiie fila- 

 ment being wholly wanting, and with the anther in the sinus. 



An additional fact of interest connected with this species is, 

 that a large number of plants among seedlings, though with sta- 

 mens apparently perfectly formed, have wholly sterile anthers. 



Seeds on Depauperite Plants. — A specimen of a grass, Setaria 

 viride, was exhibited, not over half an inch high, but which had a 

 large number of perfect seeds nearly mature. It was exhibited 

 to show that such minute plants might grow and produce seed 

 annually for many successive j-ears, the plants each year repro- 

 ducing themselves among other vegetation, without any one being 

 aware of their existence. When such tracts were ploughed up, and 

 plants like this grass get a good chance to develop themselves 

 fully, it would appear that there had not been any plant of the 

 species growing for years, and the fact used to illustrate the long 

 vitality of seeds in the earth. It might be that there was good 

 evidence that cases of long vitality were undoubted ; but it served 

 a good purpose to point out where error may creep in. 



Of Bracts in Cruciferde. — It was an axiom that no true cruci- 

 ferae had bracts to the flowers. The double Sweet Alyssum of 

 gardens, Koniga maritima, seemed an exception to this rule. The 

 lower flowers were always solitary in the axils of the leaves, and 

 the leaves were often reduced to mere bracts for a long distance 

 up among the flowers. Branches but not flowers in cruciferae 

 would spring from the axils of the leaves. An examination of 

 these double flowers showed that many had not followed the rule 

 in double flowers, by transforming stamens to petals. Some, in 

 fact, showed they were arrested branches, with depauperite leaves, 

 a solitary petal being produced in the axil of each little leaf. The 

 sepals seemed united, and formed a sort of sheath-like bract, above 

 which the petal emerged. In this form they ajtpeared as arrested

The Coronal Disk in Spiraea. — Exhibiting some flowers of 

 Spiraea Beevesiana, Mr. Meehan called attention to the elevated 

 disc which rose on the inner face of the line of filaments, and 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 61 



pointed out the correspondence in outline of each division with 

 the form of the two-celled anther. The inner line of stamens 

 were alternate with these divisions, and the whole study led to 

 the conclusion that this little crown was composed of the imma- 

 ture anthers of abortive stamens. He referred to Acer rithrum, 

 and other plants, where, in the abortion of stamens the anthers 

 were generally almost fully formed before the development of the 

 filament, and remarked that in truly female flowers of this maple 

 there was a course of sterile anthers as in this Spirsea.

Fermentation in Perenj^s Fluid. — Dr. Benjamin Sharp re- 

 marked that in a bottle of Perenji's fluid (nitric acid 10 per cent, 

 sol. 4 pts., Chromic acid ^ per cent. sol. 3 pts., 95 per cent. 

 Alcohol 3 pts.) effervescence was noticed. On shaking the bottle 

 and removing the cork the fluid frothed violently, resembling 

 very active beer ; when the frothing had to a certain extent sub- 

 sided, another shaking produced another violent frothing. The 

 fluid had been used for hardening chick erabryoes,and the portion 

 used had been turned back so that a slight sediment was in the 

 bottom of the bottle, and from this sediment the frothing seemed 

 to originate. The sediment was examined with a high power 

 lens, and Bacteria were found in great numbers. They were 

 probably introduced with the sediment caused by the hardening 

 of the organic tissues upon which they lived. 



On the Eye of Pecten. — Prof. Sharp further called the atten- 

 tion of the members to the eye of Pecten. In one of his articles 

 (On the Visual Organs of the Lamellebranchiata, Mitth. 

 Zool. Stat. Neapel, 1884, p. 457), he makes the following asser- 

 tion : " The question as to the function of this organ (the so- 

 called eye of Pecten) is one of considerable interest. Hickson 

 states that a few experiments have been made on this subject, 

 concerning the visual power of this animal ; he saj^s ' It is very 

 doubtful whether they (the so-called eyes) are of much value to 

 the animal in avoiding its enemies. The most reasonable theory 

 of their function seems to be that when in the ebbing tide, a 




62 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



probability arises that they will be left high and dry on the shore, 

 they can appreciate the fact by the growing intensity of the light, 

 and by that peculiar flapping motion of the valves the Pectens 

 are so remarkable for, move away into deeper water.' This 

 theory may at once be set aside when we consider that the Pec- 

 tens of the Mediterranean, where we have practically no tide at 

 all, a state of affairs that has existed for an exceedingly long 

 period of time, have as well developed ej'^es as those found on 

 shores where tides do exist ; and further, it seems hardly probable 

 that such a complicated organ would have developed to deter- 

 mine for the animal whether it be out of water or not. . . . As 

 regards the complicated organ known as the eye, I might suggest 

 that, if this be an eye, it is one where we have no true pigmented 

 Isiyer in any direct relation to either the nerve or the retina. The 

 mass of red pigment and the metallic-like tapetum would hardly 

 answer the place of the black choroid coat so essential to the 

 eye." 



Dr. Sharp stated that at the time the above was written, he 

 was under the impression that the organ was probably a phos- 

 phorescent organ, but he had no proof of it. At Nantucket he 

 obtained many specimens of the animal and found that the edge 

 of the mantle was phosphorent, and on questioning Dr. Kite, 

 formerly of the " Fish-Hawk," who had often seen Pecten dredged 

 at night, he was informed that the phosphorent condition of Pec- 

 tens had often been observed. He thought it was not unreasona- 

 ble to suppose that organs for the emission of light should be 

 formed upon the same general principles as organs for the admis- 

 sion of light, hence the similarity of these organs to eyes. He 

 further stated that this function (phosphorescence) would be of 

 great use to the animal in obtaining its food. 



On Amia and its probable Taenia. — Prof. Leidy stated that in 

 our market on Saturday last, three Mud-fishes, Amia calva, had 

 been given to him. They came in a barrel of shad from North 

 Carolina. One was a female about two feet long, the others male, 

 of which the smallest was eight inches. Protruding from the 

 vent of the latter was a little tape-worm, which, on disturbance, 

 retreated into the rectum. Three other worms of the same kind 

 were found in the mouth, but none were in the intestine of this or 

 the other fishes. The worms accord with the description of the 

 Taenia Jilicolis, Infesting Sticklebacks, Gasterosteus, and is prob- 

 ably the same species. They range from 1^ to 3 inches long, 

 gradually widening from the delicate thread-like neck to the pos- 

 terior rounded extremity where they measure from 1- to TS mm. 

 wide. The head is spheroidal, variably broader or longer, and 

 about 0*625 mm.; with the summit slightly prominent and 

 unarmed, and with four hemispherical, lateral bothria 0*25 mm. 

 in diameter. Neck variable ; when extended, long and narrow and 

 usually about half the width of the head. Anterior segments, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 63 



transversely linear, about an eighth the length of the breadth ; 

 gracluall}' becoming inverted saucer-shaped or scutellate, and 

 about one-fourth the length of the breadth. Posterior segments 

 more quadrate, slightly widening behind, about 0'15 mm. long and 

 from 1- to 1-5 mm. broad. Last segment longest and rounded. 

 Genital apertures marginal.

EEVISION OF THE PAL^OCRINOIDEA. 

 BY CHARLES WACHSMUTH AND FRANK SPRINGER. 



Part III — Section II. 

 Suborder ARTICULATA. 



The Articulata include the group formerly defined by us under 

 the family name Ichthyocrinidae, with the addition of Crotalo- 

 cr'inus and Enallocrinus, which possess in a remarkable degree 

 some of the most characteristic features of the group. We have 

 elsewhere shown that our former definition of the structure of 

 the ventral surface in the Ichthyocrinidae was fault}^ in the use of 

 the word " soft," in which we did not have in mind the idea of 

 membranous as opposed to calcareous, or of disk as opposed to 

 vault, but simply employed the word to express more strongly the 

 notion that the vault was not rigid. We maintain, however, that 

 the outer test of the ventral side in this group was a continuous 

 integument, composed of calcareous plates, imited^by ligament 

 and not by a close suture, and that by reason of this structure and 

 the articulation among the plates of the dorsal side it must have 

 been pliant or flexible. The exact nature of this integument we 

 do not know. The plates may have been arranged in various 

 ways ; they may even have been imbricated in some types — like 

 the interambulacral plates in some Periechocrinidae, and even in 

 some of the true Echini — these are points we may perhaps never 

 be able to settle. That there was an inner integument roofed in 

 and covered by the flexible vault we have mentioned, and that it 

 contained the summit plates and " covering pieces " we know to 

 be true in the Crotalocrinidae,and we think it altogether probable 

 that the general plan of, the ventral structure for the Articulata 

 generally is expressed in that of Grotalocrinus. 



The effect of the patelloid plates, observed in Forbesiocrinus, 

 in permitting mobility in the whole skeleton, has been heretofore 

 mentioned. The suggestions we then made are confirmed by the 

 discovery of the remarkable articulation not onl^'^ among the 

 radials themselves, but also between the radials and interradials 

 (PI. 6, figs, 3-5). This articulate structure, and the consequent 

 mobility in the test, and flexibility of the vault, we consider 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 65 



characteristic of the whole group, though it may vary in degree, 

 and is probably far less perfect in some genera than in Forbesio- 

 crinus and OmjchocrinuH. 



Zittel (Handb. d. Palseont., i, p. 353-5-G), has separated the 

 genera which belong to this suborder into three families, viz. : = 

 Taxocrinidse, including: (A), Taxocrinus, Forbesiocrinus^ Ony- 

 chocrinus, Gissocrinus, Myelodactylus ; (B), Lecythocrinus (?), 

 Dactylocrinus {Dimerocrinus Pictet) ; Ichthyocrinidse, includ- 

 ing : Eomalocrinus^ Lecanocrinus, Clidochirus, Mespilocrinus, 

 Ichihyocrinus, Anisocrinus and Pycnosaccus ; Crotalocrinidse, 

 including Grotalocrinus, Enallocrinus, Gleiocrinus. Angelin 

 refers Taxocrinus, Forbesiocrinus, Gissocrinus a.nd Myelodactylus 

 to the Taxocrinidse ; Ichthyocrinus and Pycnosaccus to the Ich- 

 thyocrinidse ; Crotalocrinus to the Crotalocrinidse and Enallo- 

 crinus to the Enallocrinidse. 



The so-called genus Myelodactylus may be left out of consider- 

 ation. It was founded upon columns only, and, if correctly 

 identified by Angelin, which is improbable, it would not belong 

 to the Articulata at all. A separation of the genera included by 

 us in the Ichthyocrinidse into two families is desirable, but all 

 attempts to define satisfactor}'' characters for such families have 

 so far failed. We have tried to arrange them according to Zittel's 

 definition as well as various plans of our own, but without success, 

 and we have come to the conclusion that the separation must be 

 based upon characters as yet undetected. It is a remarkable and 

 perplexing fact that in this whole group such characters as the 

 presence or absence of interradials dorsally, the number of pri- 

 mar}^ radials, or the position of the anal or azygous plate, whether 

 resting on the basals or not, seem to be of little value. 



Until some new light shall be obtained we see no other course 

 than to leave the family Ichthyocrinidse as we have already 

 defined it. 



Gissocrinus, which is placed by Angelin and Zittel among the 

 Taxocrinidse on account of having three underbasals, belongs to 

 the Fistulata, and has been referred bj^ us to the C3^athocrinidse, 

 as have also Lecythocrinus and Dactylocrinus. In addition to 

 the genera formerly included by us, we refer Gyrtidocrinus to 

 the Ichthyocriliidse. 



Gleiocrinus was independentlj^ referred by Zittel to the Crota- 

 locrinidse, and by us to the Ichthyocrinidse. It difiers from all 




66 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



other Articulata in the position of the interradials and may prove 

 to be the type of a distinct family. 



F. Roemer established the family Anthocrinidte to receive 

 Anthocrinus and Crotalocrinus, and Pictet, as Dnjardin and 

 Hiipe, recognized the family Anthocrinidj«, but referred to it only 

 Anthocrinus. As Anthocrinus proves to be a synonym, the 

 family name will fall with it, and we shall distinguish the famil}'- 

 as Crotalocrinidse, and follow Zittel in referring to it Crotalo- 

 crinus, Enallocrinus, but not Gleiocrinus. 



The Crotalocrinidae are distinguished by the possession of a 

 ventral tube or anal appendage, located ventrally near the per- 

 iphery. In Grotalocrinus it consists of a tube composed of eight 

 vertical rows of heavy quadrangular pieces. In Enallocrinus its 

 form is unknown. The family differs from the Ichthyocrinidse 

 in a similar way as Platycrinidae from Actinocrinidae in that the 

 higher radials are imperfectly developed. 



The Articulata, therefore, fall into two families, which are 

 defined as follows : 



A. IcHTHYOCRiNiD^. Basc dicyclic. Underbasals unequal, 

 proportionally very small, rarely visible externally. Basals gene- 

 rally small. Dorsal cup chiefly built up of radial plates of differ^ 

 ent orders, abutting laterally against each other or separated by 

 interradials. Number of radials variable in genera, species and 

 individuals. Radial and arm plates decreasing in size in the suc- 

 cessive orders, each division being about half as wide as the 

 preceding one, and of uniform size in corresponding divisions of 

 the ra}', but the plates of adjacent rays generally alternate with 

 each other. The line of articulation between radials and arm 

 plates is frequently undulating, and there are sometimes additional 

 patelloid pieces. Arms uniserial, bifurcating, generally touching 

 laterally so as to form a wall continuous with the calyx. Arm 

 plates with straight sides and very deep ambulacral grooves. 

 Pinnules apparently wanting. 



Interradial system chiefly developed on the ventral side. Spe- 

 cial anal plate sometimes resting on the basals, sometimes upon 

 the radials, and sometimes wanting dorsally. Anus unknown in 

 most of the genera. The radials are united longitudinally by 

 articulation, laterally by ligament, the interradiak among each 

 other and with the radials by a loose suture, admitting of motion 

 and producting flexibility in the calyx and vault. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 67 



B. Crotalocrinid^. Base dicj^clic. Underbasals unequal, 

 small. Basals generall}^ large. Radials so far as known, 2X5. 

 Arms uniserial, "with numerous branches, spreading broadly. The 

 branches of each I'ay partly or completely connected by lateral 

 projections or direct union. When completely connected, they 

 form reticulated leaves overlapping when folded. Pinnules 

 wanting. Ambulacral furrow deep, ramifying with the arm 

 branches, covered by alternating plates and bordered by side 

 pieces. The first anal plate rests on the basals ; it is followed by 

 others which form the base of a ventral tube. Interradials 

 numerous, covering the entire ventral surface, but not more than 

 one or two — sometimes none — are exposed dorsally. Calyx roofed 

 over by a pliant integument of irregular plates, extending over 

 the arm bases, and enclosing the summit plates and covering 

 pieces of the disk. Yentrul tube lateral. 



Family XI.-ICHTHYOCRINIDJS W. and Spr. 



We are of the opinion that some of the genera described by 

 Angelin are founded upon characters of specific value only, but 

 as the original specimens are unique and inaccessible to us, we 

 cannot, at present, undertake to review them. 



ICHTHYOCRINUS Conrad, Rev. i, p. 33. 



No new species of Ichthyocrinus have been described since our 

 first list, in which, however, we omitted to notice Ichthyocrinus 

 arthriticus (d'Orbign}-), mentioned in Prodr. i, p. 46, which is a 

 Gissocrinus, and also Ichthyocrinus capillaris and /. goniodac- 

 tylus (d'Orbigny), which Phillips had correctly referred to 

 Cyathoc7'inus.

Gyrtidocrinus was placed by us among the " imperfectly known

 closely allied to Lecanocrinus, from which it differs only in having 

 four in place of three underbasals. Like that genus it has a small, 

 quadrangular azygous piece, placed obtusely against the posterior 

 basal, and between it and the right posterolateral radial. The 

 upper radials are extremely narrow.

TO PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



Grotalocrinus was established hy Austin in 1843 (Ann. and 

 Mag. Nat. Hist., p. 198), for the reception of a single species, 

 which was described b^^ J. S. Miller, in 1821, as Gyathocrinus 

 rugosus, from a calyx without the arms. He had previously 

 used the name Grotalocrinites rugosus (1842, Ann. and Mag., 

 vol. X, p. 109), in his list of the class Pinnastella, a.nd he referred 

 it to the Marsupiocrinoidea. His original definition of the genus 

 is as follows : 



" Dorsocentral plates, 5 ; first series of perisomic plates, 5 ; 

 second series, 5. On the latter are a series of wedge-shaped 

 plates, which bear the rays ; the exact number of these plates is 

 unascertained. Column with a pentapetalous perforation." 



" G. rugosus. The plates surrounding the body agree with the 

 generic characters. Rays numerous, probably amounting to one 

 hundred. Column composed of thin joints, articulating into 

 each other by radiating strire. The columnar canal is penta- 

 petalous. The raj's are remarkably" small in proportion to the 

 size of the animal." 



McCoy, in 1854 (Brit. Pal. Foss.,p. 54), redescribed the genus, 

 but gave little additional information regarding it. He men- 

 tions the presence of an interradial plate in the " second peri- 

 somic row," and says that above, and alternating with the 

 primary radials, are five large pentagonal secondary radials 

 (scapulae), completing the cup, on each of which rests a series of 

 small pentagonal plates, supporting for the width of each plate 

 a large number (? 15 or 16) of very slender long rays. Accord- 

 ing to McCoy, the genus "differs from Gyathocrinus in the vast 

 number of its rays." 



Hisinger (Leth, Suec. Supp., II, p. 6) described under the name 

 Gyathocrinus pulcher a specimen without arms which afterwards 

 proved to be of this genus. 



Johannes Miiller was the first to call attention to the remark- 

 able characters of this type exhibited in the brachial parts. In 

 1853 (Abh. Ak. Wiss, Berlin, p. 181, et seq.), he described, under 

 the head of " Crinoiden mit netzformigen Handen," some speci- 

 mens from Gothland in which the arm structure was well shown. 

 He says he could not identify Hisinger's species because his 

 figure was too imperfect, although he thinks it may have belonged 

 to the same group. He also says that a specimen with arms and 

 branches somewhat resembling the net-form had been obtained 




1880.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



from Dudley, which he acknowledges to be Gyatliocrinus rugosus 

 Miller, but he expresses the opinion that the arms in the English 

 form are not laterally connected and that it must have had more 

 than five arms. Regarding, therefore, the English form as de- 

 scribed by Miller, Austin and McCoy as distinct from the Goth- 

 land form with reticulated arms, Miiller proposed for the latter 

 the genus Anthocrinus, of which there was but a single species, 

 A. Loveni. 



Angelin (Icon. Grin. Suec, p. 26), with the whole of the excel- 

 lent material from Gothland before him, finds that Anthocrinus 

 Loveni is a synonym of Hisinger's Gyatliocrinus pulcher, and 

 that it belongs, along with G. imgosus^ to Austin's genus Grotalo- 

 crinus, of which he also describes and figures a third species, G. 

 superhus. According to his definition of the genus, there are 

 five arms, connected at their bases by branches and pinnules, and 

 the pinnules, reticulatel}^ connected by narrow transverse joints, 

 form a broad plicated net. This reticulate structure, by which 

 all the ramifications of each ra}^ throughout their entire length 

 are united into a net-work, seems to be the principal distinction 

 between this genus and the closely allied Enallocrinus^ in which 

 the arm branches are transversely connected for a short distance 

 near the base, but are free for the greater part of their length. 

 Angelin uses the word " pinnules " carelessl}^, stnd it is evident 

 that in this case it means simply the ultimate divisions of the 

 arms. The character intended to be described by Angelin is 

 much better stated by Zittel (Ilandb. d. Pal., i, p. 356), and Jo- 

 hannes Miiller (1853, Berl. Akad., pp. 18T-192). 



Generic Diagnosis. — The calyx is constructed very similar to 

 that of the Cyathocrinidse. Its form is subglobose ; its sym- 

 metry bilateral. With arms closed, the Crinoid resembles an 

 elongated bud with folded leaves. With outspread arms its 

 figure is that of a flattened disk with five deep, narrow, lanceolate 

 areas, which separate the rays. 



Base dicyclic. TJnderbasals 5, small, pentangular. Basals 5, 

 large, hexagonal and octagonal. Primary I'adials 2X5 ; the first 

 wider than high, excavated in the middle of the distal face for 

 the reception of a very small trigonal, bifurcating second radial, 

 upon which the arms originate and bifurcate in much the same 

 manner as in 3Iarsupiocriniis. The lateral margins of the first 

 radials are very deeply incurved, extending between the arm 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



bases until the^y meet the tegminal plates on the ventral side. 

 The arms divide into numerous branches, which are connected 

 throughout their entire length, in such a way that the brachial 

 apparatus of the whole animal is included in five broad, net-like 

 leaves with inroUed edges, which when closed overlap each other. 

 These leaf-like arms are separated by very prominent, deep peta- 

 loid areas, whose margins are formed by the deeply incurved 

 lateral faces of the peripheral arm joints, and the radials which 

 are enormously thickened. When spread out, these connected 

 rays would be free from contact with one another, and would 

 resemble the outstretched leaves of a pentapetaloid flower, but 

 folded together the^^ overlap just as the closed leaves of a bud or 

 flower. The arm joints are disposed in regular dichotomizing 

 longitudinal rows, and also in regularly concentric transverse 

 rows, the alternate arrangement of joints of adjacent branches 

 being absent here. The arm branches are transversely com- 

 pressed and flattened, very deep in proportion to their width, 

 meeting throughout their entire length by their lateral surfaces. 

 Upon the dorsal side, the branches are laterally connected by 

 points of attachment projecting from the middle of each point, or 

 b^'^ direct contact of the sides of the joint, in such a way as to 

 produce a reticulated structure composed of numerous small 

 meshes. The projection of the points of attachment from the 

 middle of the joints gives them the appearance, when seen from 

 the dorsal side, of a cross with short arms, and the network ap- 

 pears to have regular cross-shaped meshes. At the lower part of 

 the ai'ms the joints are not cross-shaped, but meet directly by 

 their sides, and the reticulate appeai'ance is not so marked as 

 higher up. The whole structure of these leaf-like raj-s is adapted 

 to the greatest flexibility in all directions, and we think it prob- 

 able that the meshes of the network were occupied by elastic 

 connective substance of some kind. The joints are flat on the 

 dorsal side ; near the calyx they are extremely thick from the 

 dorsal to the ventral side, the thickest being those which rest 

 upon the radials, and they decrease rapidly toward the extremities 

 of the rays. The articular faces at the ends of the joints are 

 provided with an axial canal. Along the ventral side the joints 

 are deeply excavated for the ambulacral furrow, which ramifies 

 with the arm branches throughout their length. The furrow is 

 lined at each side by a row of small side pieces, three to four to

each arm joint, which inclose in the middle two rows of covering 

 plates, alternately arranged, of equal number with the side pieces. 



The dorsal cup is roofed over and covered by an integument of 

 comparative!}^ heavy interradial plates of irregular arrangement, 

 which extend out some distance over the rays and enclose the 

 bases of the arms, but in no sense constitute or include covering 

 plates of the arms, as Angelln's figure (PI. xxv, fig. 15) clearly 

 shows. The plates at the margin of this integument meet and 

 connect with the incurved edges of the radials and peripheral 

 row of arm joints, which are proportionally much thicker than 

 those of other parts of the ray. The arms, with their covering 

 plates, which are laterally connected without the interposition of 

 interradials or interaxillaries, emerge from underneath this 

 integument, which must have been pliant to admit of the varieties 

 of positions assumed. Also the summit plates — oral and proxi- 

 mals — must have been located beneath this integument, or we 

 could not understand their position and relation to the covering 

 pieces which are represented by Angelin's figure on PI. xvii, fig. 

 3 a. Only occasionally the first interradial is visible dorsally ; 

 the dorsal cup, however, includes always a comparatively large 

 subquadrangular anal plate, which rests between the radials and 

 upon a hexagonal basal. This supports a very long, tapering, 

 lateral ventral tube, which rises between the arms. It is com- 

 posed of vertical rows of short, transverse pieces, and its walls 

 are pierced by numerous pores. 



The calyx plates appear to be united by sj^zygy, in part at 

 least, and the lines of junction are marked by pits and clefts 

 which penetrate deeply into the walls, as shown in fig. 4, PI. viii, 

 of Angelin. 



Column heavy, round, composed of thin joints, whose articular 

 faces are traversed by small radiating canals, which form pores 

 on the external surface. Axial canal large, pentangular.

Syn., Apiocriniies (Hisinger) in part ; Millericrinus (d'Orbigny) in part. 



In 1850 d'Orbigny established this genus to receive two 

 species, which had been noticed and figured by Hisinger as 

 Apiocrinus scriptus and A. punctatus. Only the calyx was then 

 known, and the generic definition simply stated that this was 

 composed of five depressed basals, five large " subradials " and 

 five "brachials." He placed the genus in the family Melocrinidse, 

 while Pietet, and also Dujardin and Hupe, referred it to the 

 Cyathocrinidse. Angelin makes it a distinct family, and Zittel 

 considers it as belonging to the Crotalocrinidte. It is clearly 

 separated from the Inadunata by the fact that its radial divisions 

 are connected either by direct union or by interradial plates 

 between the secondary radials. Although Angelin, in his defini- 

 tion of the genus (Icon. Crin. Suec, p. 25), states " interradialia 

 nulla," his figures demonstrate their undoubted presence both on 

 the dorsal and ventral side (PI. xv, figs, la, 3a; PI. xxv, figs. 4, 4a). 

 It appears from these illustrations that in some cases the corres- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. *lb 



ponding radials of adjacent raj's meet again above the inter- 

 radials, just as in some species of Ichthyocrinus and Batocrinus. 



The genus differs from Grotalocrinus, its nearest ally, in the 

 absence of the reticulate arm structure, although there is a 

 lateral connection between the arm branches for some distance 

 above their bases ; also in the alternate arrangement of adjacent 

 rows of arm joints. The construction of the ventral covering is 

 apparently the same in both forms. There is, however, a differ- 

 ence in the mode of union of the calyx plates, the lines of 

 junction in EnaUocrinus, showing strong indications of an artic- 

 ulation, as we judge from Angelin's figs. 1, 4, and 4 a, of PI. xxv. 

 Angelin united the two types of Hisinger under his first species 

 U. scriptus, and described one new species. 



Generic Diagnosis. — The calyx differs but little from that of 

 Grotalocrinus, and when the arms are spread this produces a 

 similar discoid figure, and lanceolate areas similar to those of 

 that genus. The calyx is depressed, broadly expanding, com- 

 posed of thick plates with deeply beveled sutures, indicating a 

 union by articulation. Base dicyclic ; symmetry bilateral ; under- 

 basals 5, depressed, linear; basals 5, large, hexagonal, angular 

 above, except on the anal side ; radials 2X5, the first one wide, 

 with its distal face occupied by a deep lunate excavation, which 

 is filled b}" the second radial and the two first arm joints. Lateral 

 faces of first radials deeply incurved between the arm bases, and 

 meeting tegminal plates on the ventral side. Second radial 

 trigonal or pentagonal, and on its superior sloping margins the 

 arms bifurcate as in Marsupiocrinus. The first arm-joint small, 

 linear, sometimes coalesced with the second ; the second small, 

 axillar}' ; arms broad, thick, composed of short uniserial joints, 

 dichotomizing frequently. The branches are laterally connected 

 near their bases, but throughout the greater portion of their 

 length are free. Arm joints alternating with those of adjacent 

 rows. As in Grotalocrinns, the outer sides of the peripheral rows 

 of the rays are the thickest, and the deep inward curvature of 

 their exterior lateral faces leaves similar large petaloid or lanceo- 

 late areas. The exterior ventral margins of the incurved radials 

 of the first and higher orders, and some of the lower arm joints, 

 connect with the plates of the ventral covering, which is of a 

 similar nature as that of Grotalocrinus. Ambulacral furrow deep, 

 dichotomizing with the arm branches, bordered by two rows of 




Y6 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



small alternating side pieces, and covered along the median line 

 by two rows of saumplattchen. 



Anal plate one, in line with first radials. Of the numerous 

 interradials only one or two are exposed dorsallj^, and these are 

 succeeded ventrally by an indefinite number of other vault plates. 

 Yentral tube lateral, its construction unknown. Column strong, 

 round, with short joints ; axial canal large, round or obtusely 

 pentangular.

Cleiocrinus in its general habitus has close aflfinities with the 

 Ichthyocrinidee and Grotalocrinidae^ and this has induced us to 

 place it provisionally with the Articulata, without assigning it to 

 any special family, although it differs in two important points. 

 Cleiocrinus^ contrary to all other Articulata, has an interradial 

 in lateral contact with the first radials, forming a ring with them, 

 and the plates of the calyx apparently were not articulated in a 

 strict sense. Zittel has referred the genus to the Grotalocrinidse^ 

 while we placed it in Part I with the Ichthyocrinidse. If certain 

 parts were better known, we should make it the type of a new 

 family, but at present, having no positive knowledge of the 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. T1 



basal regions, nor even of the arms, we are not in a position to 

 give a satisfactory definition of tlie group. 



In order to obtain some additional information, we applied to 

 our friend, Walter R. Billings, who, with his usual kindness, has 

 furnished us the diagrammatic sketch of the type-specimen, 

 which is reproduced on Plate 9, fig. 5. The suture lines of all 

 plates above the primary radials, vertically and horizontally, are 

 provided with a kind of minute pores ; which, it seems to us, 

 indicates a union by syzygy, and not by articulation, and that 

 the arm structure was altogether different from that of the other 

 Articulata, Mr. Billings informs us that " the plates are all 

 joined together, but where the strain in crushing has acted upon 

 the specimen, the cracks or gaping sutures are preferably on the 

 lines of the grand divisions, i. e., the lines dividing the arms 

 from one another and from the anal series." This parting of the 

 plates, however, does not indicate necessarily a leaf-like struc- 

 ture of the rays, as in the case of Grotalocrinus, for all plates 

 united by syzj'gy, as a rule, come easily apart. 



Mr. Billings informs us that the ridges of the column are inter- 

 radial in position, which confirms the supposition made by us 

 (Part I, p. SG^i, that CleiocrinuH possesses underbasals, and that 

 the so-called basals of E. Billings are interradials. He also states 

 that the lowest visible circlet of plates " apparently overlaps the 

 column, instead of passing under it," which shows that the base 

 must have been concave, with ample space for the basals and 

 underbasals to lie concealed from view. We have indicated the 

 basals and underbasals in the diagram by dotted lines. 



It will be useful to give an amended — 



General Diagnosis. — General form obconical ; with bilateral 

 symmetry. Base dicyclic. Underbasals probably 3, minute or 

 rudimentary. Basals probably 5, small and hidden by the 

 column. Primary radials 3X5, increasing in width upwards, 

 supporting several superior orders of radials, dichotomizing 

 frequently and uniformly, and interlocking with those of 

 adjoining rows. 



The rays and their divisions are laterally connected, without 

 the intervention of interradial plates, except at the anal side 

 and along the first primary radials. The first radials are much 

 smaller than the succeeding ones, and separated from one another 

 by a comparatively large pentangular interradial. The inter-

radial of the posterior side is quadrangular, and supports a longi- 

 tudinal row of anal plates, which extend to the full length of the 

 calyx, and in their form closely resemble the radials. Arms 

 apparently recumbent. Column more or less obtusely pen- 

 tagonal ; axial canal large. 



Geological Position, etc. — Lower Silurian, Canada. No addi- 

 tional species have been described. 



SuBORDEK INADUNATA. 

 a. Branch, Larviformia. 



The Larviformia comprise the families : Haplocrinidx, Sym- 

 hathocrinidse, Cupressocrinidae and Gasterocomidse. 



The Haplocrinidse are the simplest brachiate Crinoids and 

 may be regarded as representing the larva, not only of the 

 Inadunata but of the Palaeocrinoidea generally. Even the most 

 complicated Platycrinoid or Actinocriuoid must have passed in 

 its early life a stage in which radials and interradials consisted of 

 but a single ring of plates when we think the interradials covered 

 the entire ventral surface. This stage is probably represented b}' 

 the young Allagecrinus. In Haplocrinus the conditions are essen- 

 tially the same, but here the interradials already began partly to 

 open out, and the oral plate made its appearance upon the surface. 

 It is very possible that also the growing Allagecrinus before 

 reaching maturity attained this condition, or perhaps even the 

 condition of Symbathocrinus, hut in default of any such evidence, 

 we refer the genus for the present to the Haplocrinidne. 



The Haplocrinidse are very closely allied to the Symbatho- 

 crinidse, and it is a question with us, whether it would not be 

 better to unite them under one family. Both are built essentially 

 on the same plan, but the Symbathocrinidaj — at least their 

 typical genus — had proximals, and, as a rule, a somewhat higher 

 developed mode of articulation. The articular facet in the 

 Sj^mbathocrinidse forms a straight horizontal line, it is extended 

 into a large muscle-plate, and this covers the greater part of the 

 ventral cavity, leaving only a small median space, which is covered 

 either by the interradials and an oral plate as probably in Piso- 

 crinus, or by interradials and a full set of summit plates as in 

 the case of Symbathocrinus. In the Haplocrinidae the inter- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PmLADELPHIA. 79 



radials ' are comparatively large, and rest upon the upper face of 

 the main part of the radials ; in Symhathocrinus small, placed 

 against the distal ends of their limbs, and separated by radial 

 dome plates. In the Haplocrinidae the anal opening penetrates 

 one of the interradials, and also probably in Pisocriyius, Stor- 

 thingocrinus and Stylocrinus ; in Symbathocrinus and Phimo- 

 crinus it is placed along the suture of two adjacent muscle-plates. 

 This position of the anal opening between the muscle-plates is a 

 peculiarity found exclusively among the Larviformia ; we meet 

 with it again in Cupressocrinidae, and in a somewhat diflferent 

 form among Gasterocomidie. 



The Cupressocrinidffi and Gasterocomidse are dicyclic Crinoids, 

 containing within their basal ring an undivided plate in form of 

 a disk. The disk is pierced by several large openings, a central 

 one which represents the axial canal, and by four (exceptionally 

 three or five) peripheral ones, which are continued to the whole 

 length of the column. The other two families have only a central 

 opening, which is small. Dr. P. H. Carpenter, whom we consulted 

 as to the functions of these openings, thinks it " very probable 

 that the peripheral ones represent downward extensions of the 

 body cavity in which water circulated ; while there was an exha- 

 lant or outgoing current through the interradial (so-called anal) 

 opening with which the intestine was related, so that foecal matter 

 could be carried away from the creature, very much as it is by the 

 circulation through the dorsal and ventral siphons of a Solen or 

 1/ya." 



The specimens for which Hall (1862, 15th Rep. N. Y. St. Cab. 

 Nat. Hist.) proposed the name Ancyrocrinus are evidently 

 crinoidal stems with four peripheral canals, and as such may 

 belong to Myrthillocrinus or some other genus of this family. 

 There are at the lower end four lateral appendages, which in our 



* If the five ventral plates in Haplocrinus and the allied Allagecrinus 

 were orals, as Dr. P. H. Carpenter sviggests, it would follow that these 

 two genera exceptionally had no interradials, and vary on this point from 

 all other Palseocrinoidea. To this we had reference on p. 73, but in place 

 of stating, as we intended, "Carpenter denies the interradials to V»c present 

 always in Palseocrinoids, " we made the erroneous statement : "C. denies 

 that interradials are present as a rule in Palaeozoic Crinoids." The correc- 

 tion was made througliout our own edition, l)ut we discovered the error 

 too late to rectify it in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy. 




80 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



opinion are a kind of radicular cirrhi. In a specimen from the 

 Canada Survey Museum of Ottawa we found the lower face of 

 the stem covered by a calcareous deposit closing the canals. 

 This deposit appears to have been of a similar nature to that 

 which closes the centro-dorsal of Comatula and the nodal stem 

 joints of the Pentacrini, which, according to Wyville Thomson 

 and Carpenter (Chall. Rep., pp. 18, 19), occasionally break their 

 stems at a syzygy so as to become free. In the case of Ancyro- 

 crinus, however, the stem may have become detached and the 

 free state been the rule in the adult, as those stems with their 

 anchor attached are found in great abundance. 



The bottom plate in the cah'x of the Gupressocrinidee and Gas- 

 terocomidx, which we take to be a coalesced underbasal disk, has 

 been described heretofore as representing the upper joint of the 

 column, because the plate, at least in the adult, is undivided. 

 It is, however, well known that a fusion of one or more plates 

 takes place not only among basals, but also among underbasals ; 

 while, on the other hand, the columnar joints, which in most of 

 the Grinoidea are undivided, sometimes are tri- and quinque- 

 partite. The plate of Gupressocrinus unquestionably has the 

 position of the united underbasals ; it forms, like them, a part of 

 the calyx, as much so as the basals of Dolatocrinus and Stereo- 

 crinus, in which, as a general rule, the sutures are totally 

 obliterated, and in which the basal disk resembles most remark- 

 ably the underbasal disk in this family. It is to be regretted 

 that neither the central canal nor the angles of the column in 

 Gupressocrinus give any light on this question, the former being 

 circular, the column quadrangular ; but it seems to us that the 

 plate, if really representing a stem-joint, should be quadrangular, 

 in accordance with the other stem-joints in this genus, and not 

 pentangular, as we always find it. 



The muscle-plates of the Gupressocrinidae have a more hori- 

 zontal position than in the Symhathocrinidse^ and those of 

 different rays are laterally anchylosed, so as to form an annular 

 plate with a central- opening. There is, besides, an interradial 

 lateral opening, and five pairs of radial ones. The central space 

 was probably covered by interradial and summit plates, but these 

 occupied a comparatively small space of the ventral surface, the 

 larger portion being covered by the muscle-plates. The inter- 

 radial opening represents the anus, the outer radial ones the 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 81 



axial canals, the inner and larger ones are probably ambulacral 

 openings. 



The arms of the Gasterocomidse have similar axial canals as 

 those of the Gupressocrinidse^ bnt these face outward, while the 

 others are directed upward. This is readily explained by the 

 condition of their articular facets, which are lateral, horseshoe- 

 sliaped, and do not extend over the whole width of the plates. 

 The articular facets of the radials throughout this family, 

 instead of bending over to the ventral side, stand erect as in 

 Platycrinus, and their outer ends support the interradials in a 

 similar manner as in that genus. In accordance with this struc- 

 ture, it is evident that, if the anal opening was to occupy a posi- 

 tion corresponding to that of Symbathocrinus and Cupressocrinus, 

 it had to be located, as it is throughout this group, dorsally 

 between the upper portions of the radials, which resemble struc- 

 turally, if not quite functionall}^, the extensions of the muscle- 

 plates in the other groups. The radials of the G aster ocomidee 

 have limb-like extensions, they are simply notched for the ambu- 

 lacral canal, and their axial opening penetrates the median por- 

 tions of the plates. 



The Larviformia agree with the Blastoids as to certain condi- 

 tions of their arm structure (see our notes on Gujyressocrinus), 

 and probably possessed hydrospires and hydrospire pores to 

 connect with the ambulacra ; Cupressocrinus even had similar 

 pinnules. The arms are simple throughout, but some of the 

 radials, exceptionall}'^, support two arms. The arms were united 

 with the radials by strong muscles ; but the arm-plates among 

 each other j so far as known, were suturally connected and moved 

 in a body. 



We give the following definitions of the four families : — 



A. Haplocrinid^. Dorsal cup small, composed of basals and 

 radials ; covered ventrally by five large single interradial plates, 

 which form a pyramid. These plates are supported upon the 

 outer ends of two adjoining radials, and are united with one 

 another, leaving only a small ambulacral opening. There is no 

 anal plate ; the anal aperture, so far as known, penetrates the 

 upper part of one of the interradials. Column with small 

 central canal. 



B. Symbathocrinid^. Dorsal cup small ; composed of basals 

 and radials only. The latter are provided with large muscle- 




82 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



plates, which are connected by suture, except at their inner 

 ends, where they leave generally a slit-shaped opening. The 

 muscle-plates extend over the greater part of the ventral surface, 

 and constitute a more or less elevated pjn-amid, with an open 

 space in the centre. The central space is closed by cornpara- 

 tivel}'^ small interradials and the summit plates ; the latter, as a 

 rule, are more extensively developed than in the Haplocrinidse. 

 The arms are extremely long, closely folded together. They are 

 composed of quadrangular joints, suturally connected, and 

 moved upon the radials by means of strong muscles. The anal 

 opening, where it has been observed, is intermediate between two 

 muscle-plates. Column round, with a small central canal. 



C. CupRESsocRiNiDJE. Calyx large. Base dicyclic. The under- 

 basals are anchylosed, and form a solid disk, which is succeeded 

 by five basals. The radials are provided with large muscle-plates, 

 which are laterally anch3'losed, and form a continuous plate cov- 

 ering a large portion of the body. It stands on a level with the 

 upper faces of the radials, and is pierced by the anus and the 

 ambulacral openings. The arms are simple, closely folded to- 

 gether, and composed of massive, wide, quadrangular pieces, 

 which, being connected b^^ suture, moved in a body upon the 

 radials. Column strong, containing a large central canal sur- 

 rounded b}^ peripheral ones. 



D. GASTEROCOMiDiE. Basc dicyclic ; basals and underbasals as 

 in the CupressocrinidiB. Radials large; their articular facet 

 lateral, horseshoe-shaped, covering almost the whole outer face of 

 the plates. They are provided with large axial openings, which 

 occupy the median portions of the facets, and are notched at their 

 upper end to pass in the ambulacral canal. The anal opening is 

 dorsal, placed between two radials, and either succeeds the anal 

 plate, or this succeeds the opening. The interradial plates are 

 small occupying the equatorial zone. The oral plate is very 

 large, excentric, and surrounded by four large proximals, its pos- 

 terior side resting against the radials. Arms recumbent or widely 

 divergent. 



Family XIII.— HAPLOCRINIDJE. 



Under this family we place only the two genera Haplocrinus 

 and Allagecrinus. Roemer referred to it Haplocrinus and Gocco- 

 crinus, in which he was followed by Zittel and S. A. Miller. 

 Schultze, like us, referred Goccocrinus to the Platycrinidae, but 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 83 



added Triacrinus, which Zittel, Angelin and Miller made the type 

 of a distinct family. We admit there are close affinities between 

 Haplocrinus, Triacrinus and Pisocrinus^ but we believe the last 

 two are closer allied to Symbathocrinus (see our notes on the 

 Symbathocrinidifi). Pictet refers to the Haplocrinidse : Haplo- 

 crinus, Goccocrinus, Myrtillocrinus, Ceramocrinus, Epactocrinus 

 and G aster ocoma ; Dujardin and Hupd : Haplocrinus, Gocco- 

 crinus, Myrtillocrinus and Stephanocrinus. D'Orbigny arranged 

 his " Aplocrinidse " between the Pentremitidse and Cupresso- 

 crinidae. 



In Troost's catalogue of 1850 we find the following names : 

 Haplocrinus granulatus, H. heTnisjphericus^ H, maximus and H. 

 ovalis, vfhich have not been defined, and are species of Pisocrinus 

 and Triacrinus. Haplocrinus annularis and H. monile were 

 defined by Eichwald from pieces of the column.

The first species of this genus was described by Goldfuss under 

 Eugeniacrinites mespiliformis. Goldfuss did not know the con- 

 struction of the plates, nor did Steininger who described the 

 same species under Haplocrinus spaeroideus. F. Roemer, in 1844, 

 gave a good description of the plates, but his way of interpreting 




84 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



them was rather peculiar. According to his diagnosis, the calyx 

 of Haplocrinus is composed of five basals. These, as he states, 

 alternate with five " para-basals," of which three are separated 

 from the basals by intervening plates (Costalglieder). He 

 states further that, placed upon the sutures of two adjoining 

 " para-basals," there are five simple arms, which in their closed 

 condition form a pentamerous " Scheitelpjn-amide." If it were 

 true that the latter plates, which at their lateral union form con- 

 spicuous grooves, were arms, this Crinoid would have no radials, 

 and the basals would be radially disposed, contrary to the funda- 

 mental rules of the class. The ventral pyramid had been errone- 

 ously described b}^ Goldfuss as composed of five series of eight 

 to ten pieces longitudinally arranged, and it was this, likely, 

 which misled Roemer. The fact, however, is that the ventral 

 surface is covered by five single trigonal pieces, arranged alter- 

 nately with the upper ring of plates in the dorsal cup, and that 

 the latter plates, as Goldfuss correctly stated, are provided with 

 an articular facet upon which the arms moved. This was con- 

 firmed by Miiller's observation, who, in 1855, discovered in one of 

 his specimens, resting upon the facet, a small brachial. 



Allman was the first writer who undertook to homologize the 

 five ventral plates of Haplocrinus, Goccocrinus and Stephanocri- 

 nus with the orals of recent Crinoids. It seems, however, that he 

 was not aware of Miiller's discover3' of arm joints, for he supposed 

 that all those genera possessed recumbent ambulacra. A similar 

 view was held by d'Orbigny. Schultze calls the ventral plates 

 " interradiale Pyramidenstiicke." Zittel describes the " Kelch- 

 decke " to be composed of " fiinf grossen, im Centrum zusammen- 

 stossenden, dreieckigen Oral-platten, welche eine Pyramide bilden, 

 und zwischen sich fiinf breite, gerade, durch die abgeschriigten 

 Seitenflachen begrenzte, nach unten geschlossene, nach oben offene 

 Ambulacralfurchen bilden." There is nothing to confirm this 

 view, and, in fact, we do not know how this could have been 

 possible. It is difficult to see what office the so-called " open 

 ambulacral groove " could have had, especially if Haplocrinus 

 possessed arms, as Prof. Zittel admits. The grooves, evidently, 

 are mere compartments for the reception of the arms, and served 

 for their protection. Carpenter agrees with Zittel that the ven- 

 tral plates are orals, but opposes his open ambulacra. He regards 

 the genus to be " permanently in the condition of a Pentacrinoid 

 larva with a closed tentacular vestibule." We fully agree with 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 85 



him that Haplocrinus is a persistent larval form, but do not 

 understand how the five large plates, which occupy almost the 

 entire ventral surface, and as much as one-half of the whole test, 

 possibly can represent the orals in a Palaiocrinoid, as all other 

 genera of this group in which the ventral covering has been 

 observed, have largely developed interradials, and these, whether 

 composed of one or a series of plates, extend up invariably to a 

 comparatively small area surrounding the peristome. We, there- 

 fore, regard the small central piece as the homologue of the orals, 

 and not the five large plates which we take to be interradials. 



The basals of Haplocrinus were described by Dujardin and 

 Hupe to be composed of three pieces in place of five. The three 

 small plates alternating with the basals, the " Costalglieder " of 

 Roemer, which are radial in position and support three of the 

 arm-bearing plates, were called by Schultze " parabasalia," by De 

 Koninck " subradials," while Miiller, Pictet and Zittel called them 

 " first radial plates." The term parabasals was used by Schultze 

 for basals in dic3'clic Crinoids, and, therefore, cannot be applied 

 to radial plates, neither can the name " subradials," as also this 

 term has been used in the same sense. We regard the three plates 

 as representing mere sections of the radials, which, jointly with 

 the arm-bearing part above, are equivalent to one of the undi- 

 vided radials of the other two rays. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Of very small size. Form of calyx sub- 

 globose, sometimes biturbinate, extending almost over the whole 

 ventral surface. The summit pieces are represented only by a 

 small oral plate. 



Basals five, small, pentagonal, forming a shallow cup with 

 slightly acute angles. Radials very irregular, two of them 

 consisting of single pieces, the oth§r three of two plates each, 

 connected by suture. The two single plates, which agree in 

 size — but not in form — with the compound ones, belong to the 

 anterior ray and left postero-lateral one ; they are heptagonal 

 and almost of the same form and size. The three compound 

 ones difi'er from one another ; two of the lower segments are pen- 

 tagonal, that of the right anterior ray hexagonal, its left lateral 

 face being angular. The upper segments are quadrangular, 

 except the one of the right postero-lateral ray, of which the 

 lower corner is slightly truncated. The articular faces form a 

 straight line, and occupy about one-third the width of the radials. 

 They enter deeply the upper surface of the plates, and form at 




86 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



each side of them a rather conspicuous upright projection, which 

 is truncated at the upper face. These projections are laterally 

 connected in pairs, and each pair supports a large interradial 

 plate, which almost covers the whole ventral surface. The five 

 interradials join with one another; they are subtrigonal, their 

 angles truncated ; the upper angle so as to admit a small oral 

 plate, the other two to make space for the articular facet. The 

 sides of the plates along their suture line are beveled, thereby 

 producing along the suture line, in a radial direction, a deep 

 groove, which, evidently, was occupied by the arms in their 

 closed condition. Beneath these grooves there is an opening in 

 the test, at which the ambulacra enter the cal3'x. The openings 

 contain along their median line the ambulacral passage, which is 

 oval in form. At each side of it there is apparently another 

 opening, which Schultze described as " kleine grubenartige Ver- 

 tiefungen," whose functions we cannot understand unless they 

 are in connection with the respiratory apparatus. There is no 

 anal plate ; the anal opening is small, and penetrates the upper 

 part of the interradials close to the oral plate. 



The arms are imperfectly known, but they probably were long, 

 simple, and composed of long joints, like those of the Larvi- 

 formia generally. The articulation upon the radials was by 

 muscles, the axial canals being plainly visible. Column cylin- 

 drical. 



Geological Position^ etc. — Hajjlocrmus seems to have had a 

 wide vertical range, three species being from the Devonian, the 

 fourth one, according to De Koninck, from the Carboniferous (?).

AUagecrinus was made by Etheridge and Carpenter the type 

 of a distinct family, and tins was accepted by De Loriol. In 

 our opinion it is either a Haplocrinoid or no Palseocrinoid at all 

 If the five ventral plates, as E. and C. assert, are orals, which in 

 the younger specimens extended to the radials, closing in the 

 tentacular vestibule, but in their subsequent stages were "rela- 

 tively carried inwards, away from the radials, and separated 

 from them by perisome," we should regard AUagecrinus a 

 Neocrinoid. If, however, it is a Palaeocrinoid, we think the five 

 ventral plates are interradials, which in the young Crinoid were 

 closed, and gradually opened out so as to expose the summit 

 plates. In this case, AUagecrinus was in its earlier life morpho- 

 logicall}^ in a similar condition as Haplocrinus, but may have 

 attained in the adult a somewhat higher degree of development. 



Messrs. Etheridge and Carpenter state on p. 284 of their paper 

 on AUagecrinus, that the mouth in the larger specimens could 

 not have been " roofed over or closed by a dome or vault of any 

 kind," for " if such a structure had existed within the circle of 

 radial plates, It would assuredly have been preserved." To this 

 we reply, that the summit structure of Symhathocrinus which is 

 comparatively solid was discovered after hundreds of the most 

 perfect specimens had been examined, and until then it was 

 regarded as membranous ; the same was the case in Cyathocrinus. 

 AUagecrinus in its more advanced stages, may have attained the 

 conditions of Haplocrinus or Symhathocrinus, or even of Cyatho- 

 crinus, a.nd .\jsLSsed perhaps through all those phases successively; 

 but there is not the least evidence that the Sclieitelplatten in any 

 Palaeocrinoid were carried inward by perisome as in the Neo- 

 crinoidea. 



The same writers remark on p. 286, that " in none of the 

 smaller specimens is tliere an}' trace of an anal opening, either 

 directly piercing an oral plate, or at the margin of the dome 

 between the orals and radials." And they state further, that 

 " the central end of one or more of the former may be marked 

 by tubercles, but we cannot suggest any explanation of these." 

 If E. and C. had regarded these tubercles as mere ornamentations, 

 they certainly would have stated so. We judge from their figs. 




88 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



5 and 7 6, on PI. xvi, that one of the tubercles was larger than 

 the others. The larger one may have been pierced by the anal 

 opening, for it occupies relatively the same position as the anal 

 opening in Haplocrinus. 



We cannot agree with Etlieridge and Carpenter that Poterio- 

 crinus isacobus Austin, which we referred (Rev. I, p. 113) to 

 Scaphiocrinus, is an Allagecrinus. The little cup, which Austin 

 figured on PI. 8, fig. 4, of his Monograph, is evidently a ring of 

 underbasals, with a few stem-joints attached to it, and not basals. 

 To judge from the figures, there is in our mind scarcely a doubt 

 that, in some wa}' or another, the calyx in the type-specimen 

 became detached, that the basals and radials were lost, and the 

 underbasals temporarily fastened to the arms for safe-keeping. 

 Similar detached cups are frequently found in the Burlington 

 limestone, and we doubt if there will ever be found a species of 

 Allagecrinus with branching arms. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Crinoid minute. Calyx pyriform or 

 cylindro-conical. The dorsal cup composed of two rings of five 

 plates each ; the ventral surface, so far as known, of five single 

 pieces. There are no anal plates, neither dorsally nor ventrally. 



Basals five ; suture-lines rarely visible. Radials five, elongate, 

 variable in form and size ; they are either axillaries and support two 

 simple arms, or truncate above and bear a single arm, but neither 

 one of them is branching ; when axillaries, thej' are considerably 

 wider. The articular facets for the attachment of the arms are 

 large and distinct, and nearly horizontal in position, so as to 

 give a projecting lip-like appearance to the upper and outer 

 edges of the radials. There is a transverse articular ridge 

 around the opening of the central canal, which is large. The 

 arms are strong, cylindrical, and probably withoirt pinnules. 

 The first arm-joint is much shorter than the others, cuboidal, 

 with a nearly circular distal face, the succeeding ones elongate, 

 three and four times as wide as high. 



The construction of the ventral surface is only known in the 

 younger specimens, in which it consists of five interradial plates, 

 which form a closed pyramid, the relative size of which is 

 greater the smaller the specimen. The plates are trigonal, but 

 the lower angles slightly truncate to form the arm-opening. In 

 the smaller specimens, the plates are so closely united, that there 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP I'HILADELPHIA. 89 



is no trace of sutures between them ; but the sutures gradually 

 become more marked, and turn in the larger ones into rather 

 distinct grooves. No central plate has been observed as in 

 Haplocrinus, and nothing is known of the ventral surface in any 

 of the larger specimens. Column short, of vermiform appear- 

 ance ; composed of small, low, rounded joints, with a circular 

 centi'al canal.

Family XIV.-SYMBATH0CRINID.SI, W. and Sp. 



We refer to this family the genera : Symbathocrinus^ Phimo- 

 crinus, Stylocrinus, Stortingocrinus, Pisocrinus, Triacrinus and 

 Lagenioc7'inus. Zittel made of these genera two fan^lies ; he 

 placed Symhathocrinus, Phimoct'inus and Lageniocrinus^ to which 

 he added Cupr-essocrinus, under the ^^ Cupressocrinidae,'^ and 

 Pisocrinus, Triacrinus, with Catillocrinus, under the ^^Piso- 

 crinideey These groups were adopted by De Loriol and S. A. 

 Miller. We willingly admit that Gupressocrinus agrees with 

 Synibathocrinus and Phimocrinus very closely in the mode of 

 articulation and in the arm structure ; but they differ essentially 

 in other points. Gupressocrinus has a large dorsal cup, basals and 

 underbasals, and three or four large peripheral canals, which fol- 

 low the column. Nothing of this has been found either in Sym- 

 bathocrinu's or Phimocrinus, which both have a very small dorsal 

 cup, and a small central opening along the column. After sepa- 

 rating Gupressocrinus, and making Synibathocrinus the type of 

 the group, it is extremely difficult to establish family distinctions 

 between Synibathocrinus and Zittel's Pisocrinidae. Not even the 

 irregularity in the construction of the calyx will hold good, as 

 also in Symbathocrinus the symmetry is disturbed by the 

 presence of an anal plate. Gatillocrinus, which also had been 

 identified with these groups, has a ventral sac, and has beep 

 referred by us to the Fistulata.

Not Symbathocrinus Roemer 1855, Miiller 1855, Schultze 1866 — 

 Stylocrinus Sandberger. 



The genus Symbathocrinus, as it is now recognized, contains 

 two distinct generic types. The one which occurs in the Car- 

 boniferous and upper Devonian has a large anal plate, and this 

 supports a long tube which extends to nearly the whole length 

 of the arms. The other form, which is restricted to the lower 

 Devonian, has no anal plate, nor does it show an anal opening. 

 The Carboniferous form will be recognized by us as Symbatho- 

 crinus. the other as Stylocrinus. 



When Phillips proposed the name Symbathocrinus he gave no 

 description, he only stated that the " pelvis " was " anchylosed." 

 The two Austins described Phillips' species, but they also took 

 the base to be undivided, and nothing was said by them about an 

 anal plate, although they indicated it in one of their figures 

 (Monograph, PI. 12, fig. 4 b). Their fig. 4 a is a totally different 

 thing, and represents either a Graphiocrinus or Scytalocrinus. 

 Owen and Shumard discovered the base of Symbathocrinus to be 

 tripartite, and Prof. Hall was the first to describe the anal plate. 

 The muscle-plate was taken by Zittel, and formerly by us, for a 

 so-called consolidating apparatus, like the similar structure in 

 Gupressocrinus, and homologous with the oral plates. It was 

 also the general belief that the central space was not closed, and 

 represented the mouth. 



Symbathocrinus granulatus and S. Tennessece Troost are cata- 

 logue names, S. tabulatus (Goldfuss) a Scytalocrinus, and S. 

 tennesseensis Roemer a Pisocrinus. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx small. Dorsal cup obconical or 




1886.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



basin-shaped. Basals three, forming a shallow cup, which is 

 slightly excavated for the reception of the column. They are 

 composed of two larger equal pieces which are pentangular, and 

 a smaller quadrangular one ; the latter placed to the left of the 

 anterior interradius as in Platycrinus. 



Radials nearly equal, subquadrangular ; the basi-radial suture 

 slightly angular ; width much wider above than below. Their 

 upper side forms a straight, horizontal line, except at the right 

 postero-lateral radial, of which the left upper end is sloped off 

 for the reception of an anal piece. The anal plate rests com- 

 pletely upon this one radial, occupying about one-fourth of its 

 upper width. The radials are provided with large articular facets, 

 which, extending inwards and upwards, form jointly at the ventral 

 side of the calyx a sharply angular pyramid with re-entering 

 angles. The upper end of this pyramid is truncated, and con- 

 tains a good-sized opening in the centre, which in perfect speci- 

 mens is completely covered by the interradial and summit plates. 

 The lateral margins of the facets meet at their lower ends, except 

 at the azygous side, where they are separated by the anal plate ; 

 along their upper ends, however, they stand apart, and form 

 rather conspicuous clefts. Each facet is divided vertically by a 

 narrow sinus, ^ and the two halves of the plates or the limbs, as 

 they might be called, at their upper end form an ambulacral 

 opening. 



The interradials are unusually small, wider than high ; those 

 at the four regular sides resting against the upper face of two 

 limbs of adjoining radials. The number of interradials at the 

 azygous side cannot be ascertained in our specimens, as the parts 

 connecting the anal plate with the ventral surface of the calyx 

 were not preserved. The anal plate stands in line with the first 

 brachial, it has the same height but not its width, and is suc- 

 ceeded by a slender tube which follows the whole length of the 

 arms. Hall has figured a second anal plate, triangular in form ; 

 this, however, constitutes the lower portion of the first plate of 

 the tube, which always takes a sharp inward turn, leaving only a 

 small triangular space exposed externally between the arms. 

 The tube is composed of five rows of quadrangular, rather 



1 These sinuses, which look somewhat like suture lines, give to the 

 muscle plates the appearance of representing separate pieces, iuterradially 

 disposed, and this led us at first to regard them as oral plates, 




92 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



delicate plates, which are bent longitudinally so as to form an 

 angle, and each plate extends to, and forms a part of, two of its 

 sides. The interradials alternate with radial dome plates, which 

 are even smaller, angular above. 



The summit is closed by the proximals and oral plate, all of 

 which are much larger than the interradials. The proximals con- 

 sist of four comparatively large, nodose plates, which enclose 

 toward the azygous side three scarcely convex, smaller ones. 

 The oral plate is the largest piece of the ventral side, it forms 

 an inverted cup, containing radiating grooves along the inner 

 floor, which lodged the ambulacra. 



Arms five, long, simple; closely folded together and forming a 

 narrow, cylindrical body. They are composed of a large number 

 of quadrangular joints, with parallel sutures, and are provided 

 with a deep ventral furrow, but apparently have no pinnules. 

 The first brachial differs somewhat in form from the others ; it is 

 always higher, extending to the level of the oral plate ; also wider, 

 but not quite as deep. Its proximal face is provided with a 

 muscular appendage, which corresponds with that of the radials; 

 its distal end, however, shows neither ridge nor fossae. The 

 higher brachials in all probability were united by suture, and the 

 arms moved as a body upon the radials. The articular faces of 

 the latter are provided near their outer margin with a transverse 

 ridge (PI. 5, figs. 12, 13), extending to the whole width of the 

 plate, with a transverse axial canal. The ventral furrow is deep, 

 has a longitudinal groove along the inner floor, and rib-like pro- 

 jections alternating with grooves along the inner walls. The 

 sides of the furrow are lined by two rows of short transverse 

 side-pieces — about eight to each side of the arm joint — alternately 

 arranged, which leave a zigzag median opening along the whole 

 length of the arms. There are also lateral pores, one to every 

 side-piece, and these connect with, and form the upper end of, 

 the lateral furrows at the inner walls of the arm grooves to which 

 we alluded. The lateral faces of the arm joints are provided 

 along their outer side with shallow slanting grooves (PI. 5, figs. 

 12, 13), and these agree in number with the pores. It seems to 

 us very probable that, b^^ means of these grooves, the ventral 

 furrow was brought in contact with the surrounding element, as 

 the arms in this genus are so closely' folded together, that with- 

 out them no communication was possible.

Stylocrinus has been generally regarded as identical with 

 Symbathocrinus, and Sandberger, when he proposed the name, 

 failed to point out the generic differences. He applied the name 

 to a species from Vilmar, which afterwards was found to be 

 specifically identical with " Symbathocrinus " tabulatus, from the 

 Eifel. The absence of an anal plate, and even of an anal opening in 

 the Eifel species, was overlooked or disregarded by all European 

 writers. Zittel described the ventral side of Symbathocrinus as 

 plated, and containing an anal tube reaching to the tips of the 

 arms ; he also spoke of oral plates, which were said to form 

 beneath the vault a concealed consolidating apparatus. This 

 description, incorrect as it is, was evidently made from the 

 Carboniferous form, as in the Eifel species nothing is known of 

 the calyx beyond the radials. In Symbathocrinus the anal 

 opening is located between two of the muscle-plates ; but in the 

 Eifel species, which we make the type of Stylocrinus, the mus- 

 cular appendages of all the radials are suturally united. This 

 suggests that the opening probably penetrated the interradials, as 

 in JSaplocrinus, and it may have had, like that genus, only an 

 oral plate and no proximals. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 95 



In the construction of the dorsal cup, Stylocrinus agrees -with 

 Symbathocrinus. The two genera, however, differ in the articular 

 extensions of their radials, which extend only inward, not 

 upward, and form a level with the outer edges of the radials. 

 The arms are composed of quadrangular joints, with parallel 

 sutures, and they possess a deep ventral furrow. The column is 

 circular, and. consists of thick joints, those at the upper end 

 being comparatively strong, but they are reduced very soon to 

 less than one half of their greatest width. 



The only known species is : —

Stortingocrinus agrees in the lower portions of its calyx with 

 Platycrinus^ to which it was referred by Goldfuss and MUller. 

 That it does not belong to the Camarata, and hence is no Platy- 

 crinoid, is shown by the mode of articulation, which is like that 

 of Haplocrinus, and by the form of the radials, which, in the 

 place of being notched, are extended upward, and support upon 

 their limbs a single interradial as those of the Blastoids. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Basals three, unequal; two of them twice 

 the size of the third one, which is rhomboidal. Radials large, 

 subquadrangular ; their articular facets deeply inserted, forming 

 a depression with a slightly concave upper face. Their lateral 

 margins of adjoining radials are connected by suture, they extend

 leaving but a small space for the reception of the arms.

Pisocrinus is closely allied to Ti^iacrinus, but the latter is said 

 to have three basals; Pisocrinus has ^ve. The arrangement of 

 the other calyx plates is identical, and also the arm structure. 

 Schultze, who observed in the Eifel species only three basals, 

 postulated from this that the Silurian species from Sweden, for 

 which De Koninck had established the genus Pisocrinus, also 

 consisted of but three plates, Angelin, who succeeded Schultze, 

 and who had at his command the extensive collections of the 

 Stockholm Museum, describes the genus with five basals, and all 

 his figures show five plates. We also examined from the same 

 horizon in America several hundred specimens of at least three 

 species from Western Tennessee, all of which have five basals and 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



not three ; but in one of those species the basals are so small that 

 they were almost completely covered by the column, and it appears 

 as if the sutures between the plates of the second ring, of which 

 only three touch the basals, were the sutures between the plates 

 of the first ring. A similar structure is found in Pisocrinus 

 pilula (Iconogr., PL 4, fig. 4 6), a species which in its general 

 aspect is closely allied to Triacrinus depressus Miiller. We do 

 not pretend to say, however, that this species had five basals ; it 

 is very possible that two of these plates became anchylosed, and 

 that the genus made its reappearance in the Devonian with only 

 three basals. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx in its general aspect clove-shaped, 

 its form subconieal, sometimes pyriform. 



Basals five, unequal; three of them larger and trapezoidal, the 

 two smaller ones trigonal, which combined form an irregularly 

 triangular cup. 



The radials are extremely irregular, only the two antero-lateral 

 ones touching the basals. These two are more than twice as 

 large as the other three plates ; they are hexagonal, and have the 

 same form and size. The anterior radial is triangular, with con- 

 vex sides, and rests with its lower angle half way between the 

 two larger ones. At the posterior side, the basals do not support 

 a radial, but are succeeded by a pentangular azygous plate, which 

 shares with the two large radials an equal part. The plate has 

 the form of an axillary, is broadly truncate below, with short 

 lateral faces, and is sharply angular above. The two postero- 

 lateral radials meet above the azygous plate, resting upon its 

 sloping upper sides, and against the upper half of the two larger 

 radials. Their width is identical with that of the larger ones, 

 and in a ventral aspect the radials appear to be perfectly 

 symmetrical. 



Pisocrinus has similar articular appendages as Symbathocrinus, 

 which cover a good part of the ventral surface. The articula- 

 tion, however, does not occupj^ the whole width of the radials; 

 there is at each side of the plates an upright extension, which 

 together with that of adjoining radials produces interradially, 

 between the arms, a conspicuous projection, similar to that of 

 Hajilocrinus, hut more prominent. The construction of the ven- 

 tral side is not known, the space beyond the articular faces is 




98 PftOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



open in all our specimens, but probably was covered in a similar 

 manner as in Symbathocrinus. 



The arms are long, simple, rounded along the outer face, and 

 less closely folded than in Symbathocrinus. They are composed 

 of extremely long, single joints with parallel upper and lower 

 faces. The column is circular and has a stellate central canal. 



Geological Position^ etc. — Pisocrinus is restricted to the Tipper 

 Silurian, and occurs in Europe and America. 



Pisocrinus Dixoni Troost is a catalogue name.

Trnacrinus differs from Pisocr'inus in having three basals in 

 place of five, in all other characters the two forms are identical. 

 We have some doubt whether the few species which have been 

 referred to Triacrinus haA'^e not really five basals instead of 

 three. In this case the genus would take the name Pisocrinus 

 and not Triacrinus^ although the latter has priority. Munster 

 described the base as tripartite, making this the name-giving 

 character, and De Koninck, who found five basals in his species, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 99 



was in our opinion perfectly justified in establishing for it a new 

 genus.

Ziltel has placed Lageniocrinus along with Symbathocrinus and 

 Phimocrinus, and we think for good reasons. We also agree 

 with him that the five plates, which in the specimens cover the 

 ventral surface, represent the arms and not radials as was sup- 

 posed by De Koninck. These plates evidently could be opened, 

 and there were plates underneath covering the calyx. Lagenio- 

 crinus represents in our opinion an embryonic form, and may 

 possibly be the young stage of Symbathocrinus. Of this genus 

 we found a very minute specimen, in which the arms consisted of 

 but three successive joints, forming jointly a pyramid ; while 

 adult specimens sometimes have as many as a hundred. 



Generic Diagnosis. — General form flagon-shaped ; that of the 

 dorsal cup funnel-shaped. Basals three, elongate, two of them 

 larger and pentangular, the smaller one rhomboidal, which 

 together form a tubular body which is slightlj^ wider above. The 

 radials are quadrangular, wider above than below. Two of them 

 rest upon the truncate upper faces of the two larger basals, the 

 three others against their sloping sides and against the upper 

 sides of the smaller basal. There is no anal plate. The arms 

 consist of single joints, which, folded together, form a pj^ramid. 

 The ventral surface of the calyx is not known.

This genus was referred by us provisionally to the Ichthyo- 

 crinidse, where it cannot remain, as it has not the articulate 

 structure so characteristic of that group. We now place it with 

 the Inadunata, as the arms were evidently free from the first 

 radials ; but we are yet in doubt if it should go with the Sym- 

 bathocrinidse, Cupressocrinidse, Gasterocomidae, or be made a 

 distinct group.

The Cupressocrinidse in our classification consist only of the

 differ from Cupressocrinus more than Pisocrinus and Triacrinus, 

 for which they proposed a separate group.

Goldfuss, in 1826 (Petrefacta Germania), gave a good descrip- 

 tion of this genus, to which he made additions in 1838 (Beitrage 

 zur Petrefactenkunde, p. 334). At both times he expressed the 

 conviction that the ventral covering was probably membranous. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 101 



The arms he described as bearing " siibelformige Tentakeln " 

 (pinnules), and in the description of Cupressocrinus gracilis he 

 gave a graphic account of the articular facets of the radials. 

 These, according to his statement, extend deeply inward, so as 

 to diminish largely the width of the visceral cavity, which at the 

 upper end is reduced to one half the depth of the facet. Behind 

 the " Nahrungscanal " (axial canal), he says, there extend out 

 two diverging muscular extensions, which connect by a cross- 

 piece, abut against their fellows of adjacent radials, and form 

 together a star-shaped figure, composed of five pairs of leaves. 

 The ventral surface, therefore, according to Gold fuss, consists of 

 five coalesced muscle-plates, and not, as was supposed by 

 Roemer, Schultze and Zittel, and heretofore b}^ ourselves, of an 

 independent plate or apparatus, peculiar to this genus. F. 

 Roemer described it as a cribriform calcareous plate, in form of a 

 five-leaved fiower. Schultze speaks of it as five delicate plates, 

 which join radially, four of them equal, the fifth one diff"erent 

 and containing the anal opening. He calls it a consolidating 

 apparatus, constituting a part of the inner body, and not portions 

 of the outer test; pierced by various openings, through which 

 the blood-vessels, axial canals and genital organs passed into the 

 arms. A similar view was held by Zittel, who stated : " There is 

 in the interior of the calyx, at the base of the arms, a peculiar 

 annular, so-called consolidating apparatus, composed of five 

 large interradial (oral) plates, with a round (mouth) opening at 

 the centre." Also, De Loriol mentions a peculiar " Consolida- 

 tions-apparat, qui a ete rapproche des hydrospires." 



The views expressed by us. Rev. I, p. 12, to which De Loriol 

 alludes, differ from those of our co-laborers. We held that the 

 so-called " consolidating apparatus " was composed of five oral 

 plates, which we thought stood in connection with five pairs of 

 hydrospires. To this interpretation we were partly led by a cer- 

 tain superficial resemblance, but principally by the fact that 

 Roemer, Schultze and Zittel, who had access to the splendid col- 

 lections from the Eifel, all agreed that the plates in question were 

 interradial in position. If -this had been true, nothing could 

 have been more natural but that these plates should be struc- 

 turally identical with the deltoids of the Blastoidea, and the 

 interradials of the Cyathocrinidse, which were then held by us to 

 be oral plates. 




102 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



A very different interpretation of the so-called consolidating 

 apparatus has been given to us by Dr. P. H. Carpenter, who 

 regards it as representing the united muscle-plates of the radials. 

 He wrote to us as follows : " I look upon the consolidating 

 apparatus as offering a surface for the attachment of muscles by 

 which the arms were moved on the calyx. The successive arm- 

 pieces — I will not call them 'joints ' — were suturally united and not 

 movable upon one another, so that the arms were moved en masse 

 upon the calyx, and this must have required very strong muscles 

 between the calyx and first brachials. All that is ordinarily 

 supposed to represent the articular face of the radials is shown 

 in Schultze's Taf. II, fig. 5 a, while that of the arm-base appears 

 on fig. 7 h. Now, it appears to me improbable that the heavy, 

 massive arms of Gupressocrinus were moved by muscles which 

 had no further surface of attachment — at their proximal end, at 

 any rate — than is shown in Fig. 5 a. Symhathocrinus has large 

 muscle-plates, but there is nothing of this kind in Gupressocrinus^ 

 without the consolidating plates. The calyx of Phimocrinus laevis 

 (Schultze, Taf. Ill, fig. 6 a), corresponds to that of Gupresso- 

 crinus^ with the consolidating plates in situ. There is the same 

 arrangement round the anal opening, of which there is absolutely 

 no trace in Gupressocrinus, without the consolidating plates, and 

 yet it is clear from Schultze's description that he regards (rightly 

 as I believe) the top of the calyx to be formed of the * Gelenk- 

 flachen der Radialia,' with the anus between two of them. I 

 cannot, therefore, help regarding the consolidating apparatus of 

 Gupressocrinus as consisting of the united muscles-plates of the 

 radials, from the lower portions of which they are apt to 

 separate," This seems to us a very reasonable solution of the 

 question, and we fully agree with Carpenter. We have since 

 found that the plates are not interradially disposed, nor do they 

 form separate pieces ; the sutures which we thought we observed 

 are evidently radial sinuses, similar to those which we described 

 in Symhathocrinus. 



The arm structure of Gupressocrinus was also jjointed out 

 more accurately by Goldfuss than b}^ most of the succeeding 

 writers. The outer and inner " Querbalken " of Schultze (Mon., 

 PL Ijfigs. 1 /i, a, ^9), are obviously the basal portions of incurved 

 pinnules, and as such they were described and figured by Zittel. 

 These pinnules, however, in the opinion of Carpenter, are not 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



homologous with those of other Crinoicls, there being six or 

 more of them to each arm plate, given off from each side, in 

 place of one alternately arranged, a structure similar to that of 

 the so-called pinnules of the Blastoids. Also their ambulacra, 

 aside from not being recumbent and forming no part of the calyx, 

 resemble closely those of the latter group. By removing the 

 lancet piece and side pieces in Pentremites, and exposing the 

 sinus, it will be found that the inner sides of the limbs are con- 

 structed almost exactly as the inner walls of the arm-grooves in 

 Cupressocrinus, as seen by a comparison with Schultze's figure in 

 his Monograph, PL ii, figs, 7 and 11, There are in both struc- 

 tures deep, rounded transverse grooves, alternating with ridges 

 which are truncate above, and each one of them is provided 

 lengthways with a small furrow at the top. These furrows do 

 not extend to the full length of the ridge, but are provided at 

 their outer end with an articular facet for the attachment of a 

 pinnule. The pinnules at their base do not touch laterally, but 

 leave a small open space in the direction of the lateral grooves. 

 These grooves form the outer half of a pore, similar to the 

 hydrospire pores of the Blastoids, and like the latter probably 

 are communicating in a similar manner with h3'drospires, lodged, 

 however, within the arm grooves and not within the calyx. 

 Schultze's figures 1 h and 1 i, in our opinion, are incorrect. 

 Cupressocriniis certainly had no such " Tentakel-Furche " as 

 here represented, and we doubt if the genus possessed such 

 minute irregular covering plates, either along the perisome or 

 within the arms. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal side of the calyx basin-, cup- or 

 bell-shaped, composed of rather large, heavy plates; when the 

 arms are attached and closed, the form is ovoid or pyramidal. 



The basals consist of five equal, pentagonal pieces, which 

 enclose an equilateral, undivided disk, formed by a coalescence 

 of the underbasals, or, according to others, by the upper stem 

 joint which became enlarged and as such took the place of the 

 underbasals in other genera, 



Radials five, of similar form, wider than high, pentangular; 

 the upper margins truncate, and forming a horizontal line. They 

 are succeeded by five very short pieces, of the same width, which 

 Schultze designated as " articularia " and as parts of the calyx. 

 The arras are wide, simple, closely folded together, and composed 




104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



of a single row of from 2 to 20 heavy, transverse pieces, of which 

 the upper and lower sides are parallel. The arm plates grow 

 narrower and shorter at their upper ends, they are suturally con- 

 nected, and sometimes so closely anchylosed that no suture lines 

 can be distinguished along the lateral margins of the arms. 



The radials are connected with large muscle-plates (PI. 4, fig. 

 1), which are laterally anchylosed, and together form one con- 

 tinuous plate. This covers the greater part of the ventral 

 surface, leaving in the centre but a comparatively small, irregu- 

 larly pentagonal open space, which, as we suppose from analogy 

 with allied forms, was covered in the animal by interradial and 

 summit plates. The median portions of each radial is pierced by 

 two successive, rather lai'ge openings, of which the outer ones 

 penetrate the upper margin of the plate, and serve as passages 

 for the axial cords ; the inner ones, which pass through the 

 muscle-plate, probably are ambulacral openings. The muscle 

 plate in its outer form is stellate, having five pairs of leaf-like 

 extensions, two to each radial. They contain upon their outer 

 faces indistinct strise, which from both sides concentrate toward 

 the axial opening. The leaves become more delicate toward 

 the periphery, especially interradiall}^ where they are frequently 

 broken, and the spaces, thus formed, appear in the specimens as 

 if constituting natural openings. 



The articulation of the arms with the cal3'x was facilitated 

 by the axillaria, which, like the radials, have an axial canal, 

 and, according to Schultze, similar muscular processes. The 

 articular face of the arms is truncate, sloping toward the inner 

 side, and corrugated for the reception of ligament. The arm 

 furrow is deep and wide, and contains along the inner floor an 

 unusually large axial canal, which, to the extent of the proximal 

 arm piece, is partitioned off from the ambulacral groove. The 

 exact construction of the ambulacra is not known, but we judge 

 they were plated in a similar manner as those of Symbathocrinus, 

 and not membranous as described by Schultze. The^^ probably 

 also were pi'ovided with lateral pores, and these were alternately 

 arranged with incurved, articulated pinnules, resembling in form 

 those of the recent genus Holopus, but arranged like those of the 

 Blastoids, there being four or more to each arm joint. 



Gupressocrinus has been described to possess no anal plate, 

 only an anal opening, located between two of the muscle plates. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



It litis been overlooked, however, that in the two radials adjoining 

 the anal opening the passages of the axial cords are placed con- 

 siderably to one side, leaving sufficient space for an anal plate 

 such as we find in Symbafhocrinus, and whose presence we postu- 

 lated in Phimocrinus. That such a plate really existed, is more 

 probable since we find in G. gracilis the margin which forms the 

 anal opening at one side considerably raised, and there are 

 irregular upperedgesas if these had formed the baseof an anal tube. 



The column is circular, triangular or quadrangular, composed 

 of short joints. It contains four large peripheral canals, rarely 

 three or five, and a central one, which is either confluent with the 

 others or isolated. It is frequently provided with cirrhi, which 

 have two canals, vertically' arranged, and these also are frequently 

 confluent.

Family XVI.— GASTEROCOMID^. 



The Gasterocomidse embrace the following genera : Gastero- 

 coma, Nanocrinus and Myrtillocrinus. They were united by 

 Pictet and by Dujardin and Hupd, with the Haplocrinidae ; Roemer, 

 Schultze, Zittel and De Loriol, however, treated them as a sepa- 

 rate family.

Gastei'ocoma was described by Goldfuss to be composed of five 

 basals and five radials, the latter as enclosing laterally an anal 

 plate, and the anal opening as being located next to the posterior 

 basal. This definition, although substantially correct, was after- 

 wards modified by Schultze. He found that among species, and 

 even among individuals of the same species, the construction of 

 the azygous side undergoes most remarkable variations ; such as 

 in other groups would be sufficient for generic separation. The 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. lOY 



anal opening in this genus, as a rule, is located between the 

 radials. It either lies directly above the posterior basal, and is 

 followed by a quadrangular or triangular anal plate, or the open- 

 ing is situated above the anal plate. In the former case the two 

 posterior radials may close above the opening, or be separated 

 from one another by additional plates ; the opening may even 

 penetrate exceptionally the posterior basal. Miiller's genus 

 Ceramocr'inus, according to Schultze, was founded upon a speci- 

 men in which the anal plate was placed above the opening, con- 

 trary to the typical form of Goldfuss, in which it was below. The 

 name Epacfocrinus was proposed for a specimen with very irreg- 

 ular basals, portions of which evidently had been destroyed or 

 fractured, and were restored by the animal, and this ma}' have 

 produced the irregular form. The construction of the ventral 

 side cannot be satisfactorily ascertained from Schultze's figures. 

 His figs. If, and 1 z, on PL xii, which are said to represent the 

 ventral surface of Gasterocoma antiqua, are so different from one 

 another, that we believe there is a mistake in the figures. These 

 figures differ again essentially from fig. 5 6, which is said to 

 represent the same parts in Gasterocoma gibbosa. 



Generic Diagnosis. — The lower disk has the form of a 

 pentagon, and extends somewhat beyond the column. It is 

 surrounded by five basals, four of them equal, pentagonal; the 

 fifth larger, hexagonal, truncate above. 



Radials five, pentangular ; three of them are equal, the two 

 next to the az^gous side irregular. The two latter enclose later- 

 ally not only the anal plate, but also the anal opening, which is 

 surrounded by a single ring of small plates, and either rests upon 

 the truncated upper face of tlie larger basal, or is separated from 

 the latter by an anal plate. In either case the anus, as a general 

 rule, is succeeded by one or more anal pieces, which, however, in 

 some specimens do not extend to the upper end of the radials, 

 and in this ease the radials meet above the anal plates. The 

 radials have a lateral articular facet of the horseshoe form, which 

 extends deeply into the plate. It is notched above for the arm 

 furrow, and pierced by a large axial canal, which is removed far 

 off' from the outer edge of the plate. The arms evidently were 

 heavy, and, to judge from the facets, were probably pendent. 



The mouth of Gasterocoma, according to the position of the 

 central piece, was excentric. This central — or, as we call it, oral — 




108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



plate abuts against the two posterior radials; it is large, 

 heavy, somewhat elongate, and surrounded anteriorly and later- 

 ally by what may prove to be four proximals (?). The inter- 

 radial plates appear to be small, but ma}^ be partly hidden from 

 view by the large covering plates. 



The form of the column is not known, but it was, like in 

 Cupressocrinus, perforated with a central canal and four per- 

 ipheral ones, which were confluent at the centre.

Nanocrinus is very closelj^ allied to Gasterocoma, and had uot 

 Schultze found six specimens which all have the same irregular 

 structure, we should feel inclined to regard it an abnormal form 

 of that genus. According to Schultze, the genus has five basals, 

 but only four radials ; the place of the fifth one is said to be 

 occupied by an interradial. The latter is strictl}- radial in posi- 

 tion, and as such should be designated as a non-arm-bearing 

 radial. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Basal cup as in Gasterocoma^ but the 

 plates less regular; four of them pentagonal, the posterior one 

 considerably higher, hexagonal, truncate above. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 109 



Radials five, large, irregular in size, four of them arm-bearing, 

 the fifth one not. The articular facet is lateral, horseshoe-shaped, 

 and occupies almost the whole outer face of the radials. Three 

 of the plates have a single facet, but the fourth, which is an 

 axillary, has two, somewhat smaller than those of the others. 

 The non-arm-bearing radial is smaller b}- more than one-half than 

 any of the rest; it is hexagonal or trapezoidal, and sometimes 

 altogether absent. The anal plate is placed between the lateral 

 faces of two radials, and rests upon the truncate upper face 

 of the larger basal. It is subquadrangular, somewhat excavated 

 for the anal opening, which generall}' occupies the upper portion 

 of the anal plate, occasionalh' , however, as in Gasterocoma, the 

 lower side of it. The form of the arms is unknown. 



The interradials appear to be small, but probabl}^ are partly 

 hidden from view b^^ the unusuall}- large covering pieces, which 

 occupy the greater part of the ventral surface, and rest against 

 the oral plate, which is extremely large, there being no proximals. 

 The column, like that of Gasterocoma, is provided with a central 

 canal and four peripheral ones. 



The only known species is : —

We have not seen the original description of this genus, but 

 we infer from the notes of Pictet, Schultze and Hall, that Sand- 

 berger described it to possess a quinque-partite, quadri-canalicu- 

 late base. In his figure it seems the central part was represented 

 as undivided, and, curioush^ enough, the same is the case with 

 Hall's figure of the American species, although he mentions in 

 the description " five basals and five subradials." We cannot 

 understand how a base like this could have been divided into five 

 parts — not four — and, therefore, prefer, in default of further evi- 

 dence, to regard it as undivided, although we are well aware that, 

 if any such division did exist, it would prove most satisfac- 




110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



torily that also the lower plate in the allied genera is under- 

 basal. Myrtillocrinus, in our opinion, is closely allied to Gas- 

 terocoma, if not identical with it, but it is possible that the anal 

 opening which has not been observed was subcentral, in place of 

 lateral. It also appears from Hall's figure, as if it had two arms 

 from each ray , although there is but one axial canal, which occupies 

 the central space of the facet. The facet in Hall's species is oval 

 and strictly lateral, thus indicating that the arms were pendent. 

 Geological Position, etc. — Only two species are known, the 

 one from Europe, the other from America, both coming from 

 lower Devonian beds.

b. Branch, FISTULATA, W. and Sp. 



The Fistulata embrace the Cyathocrinidse as they were defined 

 by us heretofore, but which we now subdivide into Hybocrinidaj, 

 Heterocrinidae, Anomalocrinidse, Cyathocrinidse and Poterio- 

 crinidae. To these we add the Belemnocrinidfe, Astylocrinidie 

 and Encrinidte. 



Zittel defined his Hybocrinidse as follows : Calj^x irregular ; 

 basis monocyclic ; basals 5 ; radials 5 ; arms slender, single- 

 jointed ; pinnules wanting ; and he placed in the family : Hyho- 

 crinus and Anomalocrinus. His definition is deficient and not 

 quite correct. It would admit Pisocrinus and Phopalocrinus, 

 which we recognize as members of very different groups ; and it 

 actually excludes Anomalocrinus, which has seven plates in the 

 radial series and not five, and strong pinnules, which are wanting 

 in Hyhocrinus. 



Hybocrinus represents a very peculiar form. No other palaeo- 

 zoic Crinoid deserves in so high a degree the designation embry- 

 onic type as this genus, Hybocystites and the allied genera 

 Hoplocrinus and Bserocrinus, which Zittel took to be synonymous 

 with Hybocrinus. These four genera, which are easily recog- 

 nized by their monocyclic base, large body, imperfectly developed 

 radial plates, small ventral sac, the embr^-onic state of their arms, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



and the absence of pinnnles, will be recognized by us as Hybo- 

 crinidse. 



Among the Heterocrinidse Zittel placed Heterocrinus.Grapliio- 

 criniis, Erisocrinus, Philocrinus and Stemmatocrinus. 



The family was defined as follows : Calyx regular ; base mono- 

 cyclic or dicyclic (five underbasals and five basals, or the latter 

 only); five radials ; arms long, simple, rarely bifurcating. The 

 qualification " calyx regular " cannot be applied to Heterocrinus, 

 which is one of the most asymmetrical forms of the Palaso- 

 crinoidea, and this want of symmetry extends not only to the 

 interradial series but also to the radial plates, and forms its best 

 generic distinction. 



Neither does that term apply to Graphiocrinus, which is 

 bilateral, nor Philocrinus^ which we think is decidedly irregular. 

 Only Stemmatocrinus and Erisocrinus have a pentamerous calyx, 

 but these agree in other respects with the Poteriocrinidse. 

 Heterocrinus, in its general asymmetry, in arms and pinnules, 

 and in its azygous side, closely resembles Anomalocrinus, which 

 for other reasons we refer to a distinct family. We add to the 

 Heterocrinidse the two genera Stenocrinus and Ohiocrinus, which 

 are founded upon species heretofore ranged under Heterocrinus, 

 and unlike Zittel, place Graphiocri7ius, Philocrinus, Stemmato- 

 crinus and Erisocrinus under the Poteriocrinidse. 



Anomalocrinus, which we make the type of a distinct famil}'^, 

 stands closer to the Heterocrinidse than to the Hybocrinidse, but 

 differs from either of them verj^ essentially in the relative size of 

 the calyx, which is comparatively large, and low-cup or saucer- 

 shaped in place of subcylindrical or narrowly turbinate. It 

 further differs from all known Crinoids, recent or fossil, in the 

 arrangement of its pinnules, which are not given off alternately 

 from opposite sides, but from ever}^ successive joint on one side 

 at a time from one bifurcation to the next, where they change on 

 both rami to the opposite side. In the arrangement of the anal 

 plates, and in having no underbasals, the Anomalocrinidae agree 

 with the Heterocrinidffi. 



The Belemnocrinidae, which onlj'^ contain Belemnocrinus and 

 the imperfectly known genus Holocrinus, differ from the preced- 

 ing families in having no underbasals ; they have, however, large 

 basals, cylindricall}' arranged, but even these take little or no 

 part in forming the visceral cavity. In this regard Belemnu- 




112 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



crinus resembles Bhizocrinus, but it differs from that in having 

 a strong porous ventral sac. 



Zittel's Cyathocrinidae include Gyathocrinus, Nipterocrinus, 

 Barycrinus, Eiispirocrinus, Ophiocrinus, Botryocrinus^ Palseo- 

 crinus, Carabocrinus, Sphaerocrinus and Pachyocrinus (Billings, 

 not Eichwald), with the following family diagnosis : Calyx 

 globose; basis dicyclic, composed of five underbasals and five 

 basals ; anals 1-3; arms strongly developed, single-jointed, long, 

 branching, without pinnules ; ventral side covered by " oral 

 plates." From his list must be excluded Nipterocrinus, which 

 has interradials and only three underbasals, and Pachyocrinus, 

 which is too imperfectly known to determine its position. There 

 are besides Sicyocrmus, Ophiocrinus, Botryocrinus and Bary- 

 crinus, in which the arms, throughout their whole length, give 

 off armlets at intervals, which evidently take the place of pin- 

 nules if they are not true pinnules themselves. We direct atten- 

 tion to this point, as both Zittel and De Loriol make the absence 

 of pinnules in the Cyathocrinidae the sole distinction between 

 this family and the Poteriocrinidse. 



The presence or absence of pinnules has been considered b.y 

 us heretofore as a doubtful character for distinguishing families. 

 The pinnules are extensions of the arms, and in their organiza- 

 tion, both morphologically and physiologically, almost identical 

 with the arms. They are short branchlets given off along the 

 sides of the arms, but ordinarily not extending to their tips. 

 The pinnules differ from arms only by their containing the fertile 

 portions of the genital glands, while the arms lodge the genital 

 cord. The branches of the arms may be said to be modified 

 pinnules, which differ from true pinnules in their greater length 

 and thickness. They are usually called arms when attaining the 

 form and length of the primary arms, but armlets when shorter, 

 less robust, and given off at regular intervals. Frequently the 

 branches are pinnule-bearing again, and this is the case in the 

 Poteriocrinidae, in which all arms, whether bi'anching or simple, 

 main arms or side arms, are fringed with true pinnules. The 

 presence or absence of pinnules would prove to be a much better 

 character for distinguishing the two groups, were it not that 

 Barycrinus and allied genera represent a most perplexing transi- 

 tion form in having short side branchlets, given off at regular 

 intervals, and these branching off once or twice again in a similar

mamier. In these genera it is exceedingly difficult to determine 

 whether the branches are armlets or pinnules, a question which 

 cannot be decided deflnitel}' until we know where the genital 

 glands are located. It is probable that in the genus Cyathocrinus^ 

 at least in its Carboniferous form, all branches were arms. We 

 found in G. multihrachiatus^ along the three or four proximal 

 arm joints, outside the adambulacral or side-pieces, small plates 

 in rows of fiom four to six pieces (PI. 4, fig. 7 a, 6), succeeding 

 each other longitudinal!}', which perhaps took the place of the 

 genital pinnules. No such plates, however, were represented in 

 Barycrinus, in which the ventral grooves are comparativel}'^ 

 narrow. Cyathocrinus hmgimanus has no regular pinnules, but 

 certain sabre-shaped appendages, composed of five segments, 

 which from each side infold over the ventral furrow, covering it 

 completely. These appendages which we (Rev., i, p. 25) erro- 

 neously took to be rudimentary pinnules,' perhaps correspond 

 with the so-called " pinnules " of the Cupressocrinidse and Blas- 

 toidea. 



Another good distinction between the Cyathocrinidje and 

 Poteriocrinidae is offered by their mode of articulation. The 

 radials of the former have horseshoe-like facets for the brachials ; 

 in the Poteriocrinidae they are more or less truncate along the 

 upper margin, and united with the brachials b}' a transverse ridge, 

 occupying a median line and frequently their entire width. The 

 middle part of this ridge is pierced by an axial canal, and there 

 is a kind of muscle plate with more or less conspicuous fossae. 

 The outer edge of the plate is dentated and evidently was occu- 

 pied by ligamentous Inuidles. In the C3'athocrinidae the arms 

 are always bifurcating, and their branches are given off at close 

 intervals ; those of the Poteriocrinidre are frequentl}^ simple from 

 the brachial bifurcation upwards, but when bifurcating, the 

 divisions are given off irregularly, and branches and main arms 

 bear pinnules alternately from every joint ; there being no sj'zy- 

 gies. The arm joints of the former, with the exception of Bai-y- 

 crinus, are composed of long, slender joints with almost parallel 

 sutures ; those of the latter are shorter, heavier and strongly 

 wedge-shaped, even interlocking. The same mode of articulation 



' A similar interpretation at that time was given by us of the ambulacral 

 plates covering the ann furrows of Cyathocrinus iowensis, a mistake which 

 was rectified T)y Carpenter (Cliall. Rep., pp. 03-00). 




Il4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



that unites radials and brachials, extends to all bifurcating 

 plates of the Poteriocrinidae. In Erisocrinus^ Eupachycrinus 

 and GrajiMocrinus, species with ten arms, it is found also among 

 the proximal arm plates, not, however, in the allied Scytalocrinns 

 and Decadocrinus, in which all arm plates above the brachials 

 are united by suture or elastic ligament. The same was prob- 

 ably the case in species with branching arms, in which all inter- 

 mediate joints between the axillaries are without either ridges or 

 fossae. A sutural union also connects the brachials in oases 

 where they consist of more than one plate, the apposed faces 

 showing no traces of a syzygy or fossae. In the arms of the 

 Cyathocrinidae there are, so far as observed, no articular ridges 

 nor axial canals, and no ligamentous fossiB, not even between 

 radials and brachials, nor upon the axillaries. The apposed 

 faces of all their joints fit closely together, the distal end being 

 slightly concave, the proximal to the same degree convex, so 

 that we may assert that their mode of union has been either by 

 suture or of a somewhat similar nature, and that the arms were 

 either immovable or their motions limited, and probably of a 

 mere passive character. This difference in the articulation of the 

 two types was noticed b^^ J. S. Miller when describing the typical 

 genera, for he placed Gyathocrinus separately among Inarticulata, 

 and Foterioc7-i7ius among Semiarticulata. These names, as 

 applied to the rays, are very characteristic of the two groups, 

 for the Poteriocrinidas are in their articulation much more highly 

 differentiated, approaching in some cases the Xeocrinoidea, 

 Miller's Articulata. 



In none of the Poteriocrinidie has the A'entral covering, with 

 the exception of the so-called ventral sac, ever been observed, 

 while that of the Cyathocrinidae is comparatively well known. 

 This, however, is partly explained by the condition of the radials, 

 which in the C3fathocrinidie had ample space for the reception of 

 interradials, contrary to the PoteriocrinidsE, in which the articu- 

 lation extends over the whole width of the radials, and the inter- 

 radials, partly or wholly, had to rest against the muscle plates as 

 in the Sjaiibathocrinidae. In the Cyatliocrinidae the interradials 

 were persistent through life, but they may have become resorbed 

 in the Poteriocrinidae before reaching maturity. The condition 

 of the ventral side among the Cyathocrinidie varies considerably, 

 and even among the species now referred to the genus Cyatho-

crinus there are several which range infinitely lower than others, 

 and these should be placed under new genera. 



The azygous side of the C^^athocrinidse consists rarely of more 

 than two plates in the calyx — the azygous plate and the anal 

 piece ; but the Poteriocrinidne generally have three, owing to the 

 fact that the first plate of the ventral tube extends often into the 

 calyx. The ventral sac is perhaps more club- or balloon-shaped 

 in the Poteriocrinidse, more cjdindrical in the Cyathocrinidae. 

 We subdivide the Cyathocrinidae into : 



Dendrocrinites, genera with a large azygous and well-developed 

 anal plate, embracing : 3Ierocrinus, Carabocrinus, Dendrocrinus, 

 Homocrinus, Ampheristocrinus and Parisocrinus. 



Botryocrinites, genera having no special azygous' plate or 

 occasionally a rudimentary one, and armlets in place of pinnules: 

 Atelestoci'inus, Vasocrinus^ Botryocrinus^ Sicyocrinus, Streblo- 

 crinus and (?) Barycrinus. 



Cyathocrinites, genera without azygous plate, with branching 

 arms without pinnules : GyatJiocrinus, Arachnocrinus^ Gisso- 

 crinus, Spheerocrinuf<, Achradocrinus, Codiacrinus and (?) 

 Lecythiocrinus. 



Zittel placed Gissocrinas among the Taxocrinidie, the perfectly 

 symmetrical Codiacrinus among the most unsymmetrical Gastero- 

 comid», and Ophiocrinus, Dendrocrinus and Homocrinus, which 

 are devoid of true pinnules, among the Poteriocrinidip.^ 

 AVe subdivide the Poteriocrinidse as follows : 

 PoTEaiocRiNiTES, genera having an azygous plate, a regular anal 

 piece, and the first plate of the ventral sac enclosed in the cal^^x : 

 Poteriocrinus^Scaphiocrinus, Scytalocrinus^ Decadocrinus, Woodo- 

 crinus, Zeacrinus, Hydreionocrinus, GccHocrinns, E upachycrinua ^ 

 Gromyocrinus and Tribrachiocrinus. 



Graphiocrinites, genera without az^^gous or anal plate, but 

 the first plate of the sac within the limits of the calyx : Graphio- 

 crinus, Bursacfinus, Phialocrinus and Geriocrinus. 



Erisocrinites, genera without azygous or anal plate dorsally : 

 Eriaocrinus and Stemmatocrinus.

Our PoteriocrinuliTe contain essentially the same genera as those 

 of Zittel, but we except from his list Homocrinus, Dendrocrinus, 

 Agassizocrinus and Beleinnoeriniis. For the two latter we pro- 

 pose distinct families. 



The Encrinida^ are closel}^ allied to the Poterocrinidse, and we 

 think will ultimately be consolidated with them. Nothing, as yet, 

 is known of their ventral structure, but neither of that of the 

 Poterocrinidae except their ventral tube. There is nothing which 

 proA'es that the ventral surface of Encrinus was composed of soft 

 parts, or that it was exclusively perisomic or differed from that 

 of the Poteriocrinidse which are universally regarded as Palaeo- 

 crinoids. The only difference which we have discovered is that 

 in the Encrinidiie the brachials are united by syzygy and also 

 the proximal arm plates ; contrarj- to the Poteriocrinidae in which 

 S3v.ygies, so far as known, do not occur. 



Among Astylocrinidse, wliich represent the free floating Pala;o- 

 crinoidea, we include Agassizocrinus and Edriocrinus, the former 

 witli underbasals, the latter with basals only. It is very possible 

 that Edriocrinus will prove to be the type of a distinct family. 



The Catillocrinidse contain : Gatillocrinus and Mijcocrinus. 

 The allied Calceocrinidse only the genus Calceocrinus. 



These ten families are defined b}^ us as follows : — 



A. Hybocrinid^. Base monocyclic ; calyx large compared 

 with the arms. Basals 5, unusually large. Radials irregular, the 

 postero-lateral one either unrepresented or very much smaller, and 

 sometimes non-arm-bearing. Arras frequently undeveloped in 

 one or more rays, or recurrent and appressed onto the outer 

 surface of the calyx; simple, and without pinnules. Azygous 

 side composed of a single, large azygous plate, and frequently an 

 anal piece, which in form resembles the right posterior radial. 

 Ventral sac ver}'^ small, consisting of a mere tumor-like protu- 

 berance. 



B. Heterocrinid^. Base monocyclic. Calyx small ; plates 

 irregular. Basals 5, variable. Radials irregular, frequentl}'^ com- 

 pound in one or more rays ; the right posterior radial smaller, 

 resting upon the azygous plate. Brachials consisting of two or 

 more pieces, united b}' syzj'gy. Of the succeeding arm joints 

 only every second, third or fourth one pinnule-bearing. Azygous 

 plate large ; anal plate consolidated with the right posterior 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



radial, which toward the left supports a series of anal plates; 

 toward the right the brachials. Arms long ; the pinnules some- 

 times take the form of arms, and attain the same general height. 

 Column tri- or quinque-partite. 



C AnomaItOcrinid^. Base monocyclic. Form irregular. Calyx 

 capacious. Azygous plate large ; supporting the right posterior 

 radial, which toward the right is succeeded by a row of brachials, 

 and toward the left by the ventral tube. Arms composed of large 

 quadrangular joints, giving off pinnules from one side only, from 

 one bifurcation to the next, when all pinnules change to the oppo- 

 site side. Column strong, central canal wide, stelliform, its pro- 

 jecting angles directed interradially. 



D. BELEMNOCRiNiDiE. Base monocyclic. Basals large ; cylin- 

 drical; solid, only pierced by a narrow central canal with a shal- 

 low concavity at its upper end. Radials small, quadrangular, 

 enclosing an anal plate of the same form. Ventral sac large, 

 club-shaped. Arms long with numerous syzygies, only every 

 second or third joint pinnule-bearing. Pinnules long, often 

 bifurcating. Column round or pentangular, frei^uently with long 

 cirrhi given off' interradially. 



E. Cyathocrinid^. Base dic3'clic. Cal3^x globose, rarely 

 turbinate. Radials with horseshoe-like lateral facets supporting 

 at least two, but frequently several more brachials. Arms without 

 true pinnules, but with branches in regular succession to their 

 tips. Arm joints with a few exceptions long and narrow ; quad- 

 rangular with almost parallel sides ; united either by suture or 

 ligament, apparently not by muscles. Ventral sac large, cylin- 

 drical. Column round or pentagonal ; central canal rather above 

 medium size, pentagonal, the projections directed radially. 



F. PoTERiocRiNiD^E. Base dic^'clic. Calyx deep and turbi- 

 nate, or shallow and disk-like, owing to the form of the under- 

 basals, which are either extended into a cup, or are turned inward 

 and concave. Radials somewhat irregular, of variable size, the 

 right posterior one generally smaller ; all truncated at the upper 

 face. Brachials one or two, connected b}' suture; the lower or 

 proximal face truncate. Arms simple or branching, with pinnules 

 alternately arranged from every joint ; without syzvgy. Arm 

 joints cuneate or interlocking. Articulation between brachials 

 and radials by muscles and ligament, and also between the upper 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



faces of all axillaries and succeeding plates. Ventral sac large, 

 frequently inflated. Column more or less pentagonal, its outer 

 angles placed interradiall}' , the cirrhi radially. 



(r. Encrinid^. Dicyclic. Closely allied to the Poteriocrinid*, 

 but, as a rale, without anal plates. Basals with well-developed 

 axial canals proceeding to the radials. Their brachials com- 

 posed of two pieces, united by S3'zygy, frequently with other 

 syzj'gies in the higher portions of the arms. Arms biserial or 

 uniserial. 



H. AsTYLOCRiNiDiE. PeduucuUite in earlier life, detached from 

 the column and free-floating in the adult, but not cirrhus-bearing. 

 Plates of the calyx massive, and hence the visceral cavity com- 

 paratively small. Underbasals pi'esent or absent, and also the 

 azygous piece is sometimes wanting ; while the anal plate is 

 always well developed. 



I. Catillocrinid^. Base uionoe^x-lic. The pentamerous sym- 

 metry greatly disturbed by the unequal size of the radials. Those 

 of the antero-lateral rays much larger and supporting many more 

 arms. Arms simple ; composed of single joints resting directl}^ 

 upon the radials, with a separate socket for each arm, and a furrow 

 for each ambulacrum. Anterior ray, and both posterior rays 

 rar'elj' with more than one arm each. There is no azj^gous nor 

 special anal plate, one of the posterior radials supports towards 

 the left a large ventral tube, composed of a single row of heav}'- 

 curved plates, longitudinall}' arranged, with an open furrow along 

 their inner, i. e., A^entral side. Column circular. 



J. Calceocrinid.-e. Base monocyclic. Calyx laterally de- 

 pressed ; hanging downward from the column ; composed of 

 three unequal basals, three arm-bearing radials, and two azygous 

 radials without arms. Basals and radials united b^' ligament, 

 and toward the anterior side by muscles also. In the normal 

 position of the crinoid, the basals are located posteriorly, 

 and the three radials at the opposite side. Anterior radial 

 smaller, compound ; composed of two pieces, which frequently 

 are separated b}' the overhanging sides of the two lateral radials. 

 Arms of the lateral rays more numerous and branching; anterior 

 ray with a single arm, which sometimes dichotomizes toward the 

 upper end. Anal tube as in the Catillovrinidee.

 Schmidt (in part), 1874 ; Zittel (in part), 1879. 



The genus Baerocrinus has been a subject of much controversy 

 ever since 1864, owing to doubts whether the genus should be 

 admitted or rejected. It is unnecessary to give again a full 

 history of these controversies, for which we refer to Dr. P. H. 

 Carpenter's paper " On the Relations of Hybocrinus, Baerocrinus 

 and Hybocystites,^^ and to our notes " On Hybocrinus, Hoplo- 

 erinus and Baerocrinus,^^ in the American Journal, of 1883. 

 Carpenter agrees with us and with Volborth and Grevingk that 

 Baerocrinus is a good genus, and not, as suggested b}- Eichwald 

 and Schmidt, an abnormal specimen of Hybocrinus dijicntas. 

 There has been also much ditierence of opinion as to the meaning 

 of certain plates. The type specimen has on its surface, along 

 the basi-radial suture, and between two of the plates within the 

 second or so-called radial ring, a peculiar structure, composed of 

 numerous, irregular pieces, and upon this, principally, Volborth 

 founded the genus. He took this structure to be a madreporic 

 body ; while Grevingk, Eichwald and Schmidt held it to be an 

 accidental break in the test, due to mechanical agencies. Car- 

 penter considered it to be the regular anal opening. He pointed 

 out that it had the position of the anus in the Pentacrinoid larva 

 at its earlier phases. 



We stated in our paper that we did not agree with an3- of those 

 views. We think it possible that this structure may have served 

 as an anal opening, but as an abnormal one, which had opened 

 out -when the regular opening became functionally defective. 

 We also differ from other authors in our interpretation of the 




120 rROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



plates. Those of the second circlet have been regarded all five as 

 radials, and the calyx to the top of the radials as being perfectly 

 symmetrical. It looks to us unreasonable, when we compare 

 Baerocrinus with Hoplocrinus and Hyhocrinus^ and finding their 

 structure in other essential points almost identical, that the one 

 genus should be almost perfectly symmetrical, the other ex- 

 tremely irregular. And, therefore, it is probable that one of the 

 non-armbearing so-called radials represents an azygous plate, such 

 as we find in most of the Fistulata, that the right posterior radial 

 and the anal plate were as yet unde\eloped, and that Baerocrinus 

 had but four radials. This interpretation of the plates, it seems to 

 us, is corroborated by the gradual disappearance of the azygous 

 plate among allied forms in pal^ontological times, and by the 

 contemporary increase in the dimensions of the right posterior 

 radial and the anal plate. The two latter pieces probably were 

 absorbed from the azygous plate : at first the posterior radial, 

 which in Hoplocrinus took the right upper corner, the left side 

 remaining intact ; afterwards in Hyboa-inus the anal [)iece, which 

 absorbed the left corner of the plate also.' 



All this goes to prove that Baerocrinus represents a very low 

 organization, or is, according to I\ H. Carpenter, "a permanent 

 larval form." 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Form of the calyx cup- or goblet- 

 shaped. Underbasals wanting. Basals five, subequal and com- 

 paratively large. 



Radials large, irregular, onl}- four of them developed, the right 

 postero-lateral one absent. Three of the plates equal, the fourth 

 one narrower. A large azygous plate occupies the same range 

 with the radials and, like these, rests alternately upon the basals. 

 It is undivided, and resembles the radials in form. In the type 

 specimen onl}' three of the radials are arm-bearing, the smaller 

 one not having even an arm-facet. Arms five, simple throughout, 



' In our paper on Ilyhocrimis, Iloploerinus and Baerocrinus, we stated 

 that probably the azygous jilate of the latter was homologous with the 

 anal plate as represented in the larva of Anfcdon. In making this state- 

 ment we had overlooked the fact that the latter plate is simply an inter- 

 radial with special Innction, while the azygous plate in Baerocrinvs is as 

 much radial as interradial. They both agree, hcjwever, in being absorbed 

 by other jilates ; the azygous plate palseontologically by the right posterior 

 radial and anal plate, the other in the growing animal over the whole 

 surface. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



composed of single quadrangular joints and destitute of pin- 

 nules ; the ventral grooves lined by alternate plates. Form of 

 the anus, ventral covering and length of arms unknown. 



Remarks. — In our analysis, we have taken the absence of the 

 right posterior radial to be a fixed character. It is, however, 

 possible that this plate was exceptionally undeveloped in the 

 t3^pe specimen, and in this case Baerocrinus Ungerni, the only 

 known species of the genus, must be placed under Hoplocrinus.

Volborth, F. Schmidt, Zittel and Carpenter have made Hoplo- 

 crinus a synonym of Hybocrinus, although they admit that the 

 two forms differ in the construction of their az3'gous side. We 

 have heretofore directed attention to the fact that the differences 

 in the number and arrangement of the azygous and anal plates 

 have been generally regarded as good characters for distinguish- 

 ing genera, and especially among the Cyathocrinidse and allied 

 families in which those plates frequently form the only means 

 for generic separation. That the one azj-gous plate in Hoplo- 

 crinus is equivalent to the two in Hybocrinus, which we have 

 fully admitted, does not warrant an exception in this case, as the 

 differences in the arrangement of the respective plates are 

 evidently the result of modifications from one to another. We, 



therefore, accept Grevingk's genus, and give the following —

Generic Diagnosis. — General form pyriform, more protuberant 

 upon the azygous side. Calyx composed of five basals, four 

 large radials, and a large azygous plate. The latter with its left 

 side extending to the upper mai-gins of the four large radials, its 

 sloping right side supporting the fifth radial, which is small and 

 triangular, and, taken jointly with the azygous piece as one plate, 

 the two resemble in form the four large radials, only that the 

 arm-facet is pushed to one side. 



Basals large, pentagonal, nearly equal in size. Four of the 

 radials pentagonal, the smaller one subtriangular, resting upon 

 the right sloping upper side of the azygous plate, which is 

 irregularly pentagonal. Arm-facets occupying scarcely one-third 

 of the width of the radials. Arms simple, without pinnules; 

 composed of quadrangular joints, arranged parallel to each other. 

 Column cylindrical.

When we defined Hybocrinus., Rev., Pt. i, p. H, we regarded it as 

 synon3^mous with Hoplocrinus and Baerocrinus, wliich, we have 

 since shown, are generically distinct. However, in our late 

 paper in the Amer. Journal we made some remarks upon the 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 123 



azygous side, which must be modified. We asserted that the 

 upper end of the anal plate possessed a peculiar crenulated sur- 

 face, a structure which Wetherby had previously described, and 

 which we thought we had observed also in some of his specimens. 

 The fact that the so-called " crenulation " was visible, more or 

 less, in every specimen which Wetherby had sent us for com- 

 parison, led us to believe that it was an organic structure, prob- 

 ably of a similar nature as the pectinated rhombs of the Cystidea. 

 We are now satisfied that we had not sufficiently taken into con- 

 sideration the peculiar state of preservation of Wetherby 's 

 specimens, which are not only highly silicified, but the surface 

 of the plates is badly weathered, and more or less destroyed. 

 Through the kindness and liberality of Mr. Walter Billings we are 

 now enabled to give a more satisfactory interpretation of these 

 parts. On receiving our paper he promptly informed us that in 

 the Canadian species of Hyhocrinus the azygous plate was not 

 crenulated, but crowded by numerous, very small pieces, forming 

 a short pyramid. He accompanied his description with good 

 figures, and offered us his specimens for examination. In these 

 we found, resting upon the upper side of the anal plates, several 

 rows of minute subquadrangular pieces, about six to the width 

 of the plate, which together form a tumular protuberance without 

 any visible opening. • There appear, however, minute pores along 

 the sutures, and it is evident that the protuberance represents a 

 ventral sac, reduced to its minimum size. The crenulated 

 appearance in Wetherby 's specimens is evidently the result of 

 weathering, the apparent grooves representing the sutures 

 between the small plates. A similar short protuberance has been 

 observed in Eyhocystites^ and in all probability was present in the 

 two other genera. 



No new species of this genus have been described since our 

 first discussion. We found several specimens in the Trenton 

 limestone, near Knoxville, Tennessee, but none of them perfect 

 enough for specific identification.

Hyhocystites combines, in a remarkable degree, some of the 

 characters of Palaeocrinoidea, Cystidea and Blastoidea. Wetherby 




124 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



describes it as a Cystid, Carpenter was more inclined to place it 

 with the Blastoids ; while we take it to be a Palseocrinoid of low 

 organization. 



There are several points in Wetherby's description with which 

 we cannot agree. He describes the mouth or ambulacral orifice 

 as situated nearly centrally upon the upper surface. We had 

 several of Wetherby's best specimens for comparison, but were 

 unable to observe in an}^ of them an external oral orifice, and 

 doubt if such an orifice existed in this Lower Silurian genus 

 " upon the surface." Neither can it be ascertained from the 

 specimens whether there were proximals surrounding the oral 

 plate. Wetherby further speaks of " a valvular anal opening, 

 placed between the upper azj^gous plate and the mouth," and he 

 mentions " a proboscis or ventral sac " which was said to be 

 " indicated by the presence of the upper azygous plate." If it is 

 meant that the so-called " valvular opening " is separated from 

 the ventral sac, and we infer it from fig. 1 on Plate 5, which shows 

 an irregular break upon the ventral surface in the direction to 

 which he alludes, he is certainly in error. Even if an opening 

 did exist, we doubt if he could have observed small, valvular 

 pieces in specimens in which even the larger ventral plates cannot 

 be distinguished. If he means that the anal opening is connected 

 with the ventral sac, placed along its inner- or ventral side, we 

 can partly agree with him. 



Wetherby described the genus as having in three of its rays 

 arms like those of the Crinoidea, in the other two rays appressed 

 ambulacra, such as occur in the Cystidea. He does not say any- 

 thing about the length of the three arms, leaving it in doubt, 

 whether he took the three projections to be only the stumps of 

 the arms, or as representing their full length. He only mentions 

 that the arms are composed of a single row of plates, that they 

 are very deeply excavated at the inner side by the ambulacral 

 furrows, and that the latter are covered by a closely interlocking 

 series of small plates, having the same arrangement as those of 

 the two appressed ambulacra. He mentions further a more or 

 less obscure furrow upon the outer surface, " of which nothing- 

 further is known." 



Carpenter, in his paper on Hyhocrinus and Hybocysiites, called 

 attention to the fact, that in Wetherby's figures, and in the speci- 

 mens which he had examined himself, only one or two so-called 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 125 



arm joints were shown, that from appearances there had been no 

 others, and that these formed, in all probability, " merely upward 

 prolongations of the radials." He states further that the " more 

 or less obscure furrow," seen by Wetherby upon the outer surface 

 of each arm, was in reality a recurrent ambulacrum, and that in 

 his opinion the relations of Hybocystites are rather with the Blas- 

 toids and " Crinoids than with the Cystids." Upon the latter 

 point we cannot agree with him, although we admit that there are 

 recurrent ambulacra in all five rays. We think, like Wetherby, 

 that the ambulacra resemble decidedly those of the Cystids, and 

 not those of the Blastoids. Hybocystites evidently had no hydro- 

 spires and no hydrospire pores, and the ambulacra, contrary to 

 any of the Blastoids, extend beyond the radials down into the 

 basals. Neither has it calicine pores, nor pectinated rhombs, and 

 hence cannot be a Cystid, even if it has appressed ambulacra, 

 which, we think, take the place of true arms. 



Among the specimens from the Canada Survey Museum, which 

 we had the good fortune to examine through the kindness of Prof. 

 Whiteaves, we examined the type of Lecanocrinus elegans Billings 

 ( Taxocrinus elegans W. and Sp.), one of the earliest of all known 

 Crinoids, and which seems to be destined to throw light upon the 

 peculiar ambulacra of Hybocystites. This beautiful and well- 

 preserved specimen has upon the outer or dorsal surface of its free 

 arms, upon each one of them, from their tips as far down as the 

 top of the secondary radials, in addition to their regular ventral 

 furrows a recurrent dorsal furrow, such as is found in Hybocys- 

 tites upon the calyx, and dorsally and ventrally upon the two arm 

 joints. These dorsal furrows are indistinctly represented by 

 Billings in Decade iv, PI. 4, fig. 4 a, although in the specimen 

 they are well defined, and it appears as if they had been lined by 

 a double series of alternating plates. Such dorsal furrows have 

 since been identified also in the type of Taxocrinus Isevis by 

 Walter R. Billings. That these furrows are continued from the 

 ventral side, and as such form a part of the ambulacra, cannot be 

 doubted, and is further proven by the fact that the furrows 

 diminish in width as they descend the surface of the arms. In 

 these species the regular furrows of the arms probably were not 

 sufficient to supply the animal. This was certainly the case in 

 Hybocystites, which in two of its rays has no brachial appendages 

 whatever, and these consist in the three other rays of but a few 




12G PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



joints, the ambulacra resting almost exclusively against the dorsal 

 side of the calyx, 



Eybocystites is one of the earliest and lowest forms of the 

 Palseocrinoidea ; it may be regarded as a permanent larval form 

 of Hybocrinus, which had no arms, but in their place food grooves 

 upon the dorsal side of the calyx. It is interesting that in this 

 case as in that of Baerocrinus^ which has similar relations to 

 Hoplocrinus as this has to Hyhocrinus, three of the rays are some- 

 what higher developed than the two others. 



We propose the following : — 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Eybocystites agrees with Hybo- 

 crinus in its general form, the arrangement and proportions of 

 the plates in the calyx, in the ventral covering, and in the form 

 and size of the ventral sac, but differs from that genus essentially 

 in the arm structure. It has no underbasals ; five large subequal 

 basals, five radials, one of them much smaller and resting upon 

 the right sloping upper side of the large azygous plate. The 

 latter supporting at its left sloping side an anal plate, in form 

 resembling the adjoining small radial. Arms rudimentary, of 

 the most primitive kind, restricted to the two posterior rays and 

 the anterior one. They consist, so far as known, of two quad- 

 rangular joints, which are united with the radials by close suture. 

 The joints are provided with an ambulacral furrow, which enters 

 the cal3^x apparently at the top of the radials as in Hoplocrinus. 

 This furrow passes from the ventral side of the two arm joints, 

 over the top of the upper one, and follows the dorsal side of the 

 plates until reaching the calyx, whence it extends upon the sur- 

 face of the radials to the basals, either entering them or terminat- 

 ing close to the basi-radial suture or along the face of the large 

 azygous plate. The two antero-lateral rays have no arm plates 

 whatever, but each is provided with an ambulacral furrow, pass- 

 ing out from near the top of the radials, traversing these plates, 

 and entering the basals. There is considerable irregularity in 

 their position and length, but as a rule these latter furrows enter 

 deeper into the basals than those of the three other rays. The 

 furrows are provided with two rows of side pieces which are 

 arranged in the usual wa3% 



Ventral sac short, as in Hybocrinus, provided along its ventral 

 «ide with a small anal opening. Column circular, small.

Family XVIII.— HETEROCRINID^ Zittel. 

 (Emend. W. and Sp.) 



Zittel and S. A. Miller included among the Heteroorinidae the 

 genera Graphiocrinus and Erisocrinus, which both have iinder- 

 basals, and which differ essentially in the plates of the azygous 

 side. We place in this family only Heterocrinus, locrinus and 

 our new genera Stenocrinus and Ohiocrinns. 



The Heterocrinidse differ from the Cyathocrinidae and Poterio- 

 crinidffi in the absence of underbasals, in the arm structure, and 

 the arrangement of their azygous plates. 



In 1866, Hall thought he observed in Heterocrinus two rings 

 of five pieces beneath the radials, and he adopted the term basals 

 for those of the proximal ring, and that of subradials for those 

 of the succeeding one. Afterwards, it was proved by Meek, Ohio 

 Paleont., i, p. 2, that the so-called "basals" — proximal ring — 

 were not plates of the calj'x but parts of the column. He de- 

 scribed the stem to be divided longitudinally, and the so-called 

 " basals," which in their vertical range wei'e said to correspond 

 with the five segments of the column, as constituting the imper- 

 fectly developed uppermost stem joint. Meek proposed for these 

 plates the name " subbasals," and called those of the next ring 

 basals, while we used on Pt. I of the Revision the terms under- 

 basals and basals, respectively, as we took all of them to be 

 integral parts of the calj'x. 



We have latelj^ given this subject careful consideration, and 

 found by grinding the column in various species, that important 

 differences exist among the species originally referred to this 

 genus. We found that most of them have a pentapartite column, 

 of which the five sections alternate with the basals without form- 

 ing a part of the calyx, but that the column of Heterocrinus 

 simplex, Hall's typical species, is tripartite, composed of three 

 equal sections. 



We have elsewhere shown that whenever the column is divided, 

 its sections alternate with the proximal ring of plates in the 

 calyx. They are placed interradially when those plates are under- 




128 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



basals, radially when thej' are basals, and as they have in Hetero- 

 crinus and allied genera a radial position, we may assert that these 

 genera had no underbasals. The Heterocrinidae occup};^, owing to 

 the absence of underbasals, relatively, the same position toward 

 the Cyathocrinidae and Poteriocrinidae as the Actinocrinidae and 

 Platyerinidae hold toward the Rhodocrinidae. They agree with 

 the Cyathocrinidae and Poteriocrinidae in having the azygous 

 interradius extended into a porous ventral sac. 



The arms consist of single joints, are comparatively strong, 

 and either bifurcate or remain simple from above the brachials. 

 The pinnules are given off not from alternate joints, but alter- 

 nately from each second, third or fourth joint. They are heavy 

 and long, and sometimes bifurcate near their tips. In the 

 typical form of Heterocrinus alwa3S two joints are connected by 

 syz3'gy, but we are unable to prove the syzj^gy in species referred 

 by us to Stenocrinus and Ohiocrinus, unless by the pinnules 

 which are given off regularly from every third or fourth joint. 

 Most probably in locrinus and Stenocrinus the pinnules, and 

 sometimes even their branches, were developed into regular arms, 

 for the divisions follow each other alternately and at regular 

 intervals, and the branches have no further pinnules. 



The Heterocrinidae agree with the Hybocrinidae in the absence 

 of underbasals, but differ essentially in the proportions of the 

 calyx and ventral sac. In the former the calyx is extremely 

 small, the ventral tube large ; in the Hybocrinidae, on the con- 

 trary, the calyx comparatively large and the sac small. They 

 also differ in the structure of the arms, which in the Hetero- 

 crinidae are more highly developed. 



The structure of the ventral side has been observed only in 

 ''^Heterocrinus juvenis,^^ where it is composed of five compara- 

 tively large plates, which enclose a small oral plate. The ventral 

 sac throughout the whole family is much stronger than in the 

 Hybocrinidae, reaching sometimes the tips of the arms, and it is 

 profusely perforated. 



Position, Locality, etc. — Confined to the Lower Silurian of 

 America. The Heterocrinidae, although forming a neat little 

 group by themselves, may be considered as the forerunners of 

 several types which afterwards became distinct families. Hetero- 

 crinus foreshadows the Belemnocrinidae, locrinus the Poterio- 

 crinidae, while Anomalocrinus is a prophetic type for the Cyatho- 

 crinidae.

Heterocrinus, as defined by Hall and revised by Meek, contains 

 so widely different species that a subdivision becomes necessary. 

 This has been conceded by previous writers. Wetherby, in 

 describing his H. Milleri, expressed the opinion that in the com- 

 parative size of the column, and in the plates of the calyx, that 

 species differed sufRcientl}^ from Heterocrinus simplex to be sep- 

 arated at least subgenerically. And a year later, he directed 

 attention to his H. Vaupeli, which he thought to be very distinct 

 in the structure of its arms. H. Vaiipeli, if it is a good species, 

 which we doubt, agrees in its arms and pinnules closely with H. 

 constricttis and H. laxus, with either of which it may be identical, 

 but not with H. simplex, as suggested by S. A. Miller. The 

 species heretofore referred to Heterocrinus vary in the composi- 

 tion of their radials, in the structure of arms and pinnules, and 

 in the column. Heterocrinus simplex, Hall's type, has five basals 

 of varying form, owing to irregularities in the radials. The 

 radials in two of the rays consist of a large single plate, two 

 others are divided into two sections, and the fifth one rests upon 

 the azygous plate, which agrees in size with the lower half of 

 the compound radials. The compound plates consist of two 

 pieces each, which together, agree closely in form and size with 

 the two single plates. The brachials are large ; they consist of 

 two nearly equal plates, united b}' syzj^gy, and support ten heavy, 

 simple arms. The arms, to their full length, are composed of 

 syzygial joints, which, as we think, were connected by suture and 

 not by articulation. The epizygal or pinnule-bearing pieces are 

 slightly wedge-shaped, and alternate with one another ; the lower 

 or hypozygal ones rhomboidal, and their upper and lower sides 

 are parallel. Pinnules stout and comparatively long. 



All other species heretofore referred to this genus, with the 

 exception of H. canadensis, which may be identical with H. sim- 

 plex, have a somewhat different arm structure. Not only are the 

 pinnules given off at greater intervals, but they attain the size 

 and form of arms or armlets, which sometimes branch again, and 

 extend to the general height of the primary arms. The latter 

 agree also in having a strictly pentagonal and pentapartite 




130 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



column, contrary to H. simplex^ in which the column is stouter, 

 almost circular, and regularly tripartite. The species with a 

 quinque-partite column are divisible again into two groups, the 

 one with a straight, comparatively small ventral tube, the other in 

 which the tube is thread-like, convoluted, and even in its coiled 

 state extending beyond the limits of the arms. We hold these 

 differences important enough to make them the basis for another 

 separation, proposing for the latter the genus Ohiocrinus, with 

 H. laxus Hall = Ohiocrinus laxus as type, and for the other 

 the genus Stenocrinus with H. heterodactylus Hall = Stenocrinus 

 heterodactylus as type. 



Heterocrinus insequalis and H. articulosus Billings have been 

 referred by us to Galceocrinus ; H. C7'assus and siibcrassus 

 to locrinus. 



The genus Heterocrinus thus restricted may be defined as 

 follows : — 



Revised Diagnosis. — Calyx small ; subcylindrical ; tapering but 

 slightly from the column upwards. 



Basals five, more or less unequal, without underbasals ; the so- 

 called subbasals of Meek representing the upper stem joint. 



Radials very irregular, and varying among the rays in number 

 as well as in size. There are two segments in the two antero- 

 lateral rays, while the three remaining rays have but one, this, 

 however, nearly as large as the two in the other rays. The two 

 plates at the right postero-lateral side consist of the azygous 

 piece — the lower one — and of the radial, which upon its upper 

 side supports the brachials, giving off laterally a small ventral 

 tube. Arms ten, composed of single joints, alternately united by 

 syzygy, with strong pinnules from every second joint. 



Column tripartite, almost circular ; axial canal large, pentalo- 

 bate, the lobes directed interradially.

 arms long. 



Basals five ; of a more regular form than in Heterocrinus, 

 angular at their superior margins. They form a cup, which 

 spreads but little from the column upwards. 



Radials irregular, consisting of one or two plates ; two of the 

 rays — sometimes three — being composed of two segments each, 

 the others of only one. The single plates are almost as large as 

 any of the compound ones. Only four of the radials supported 

 upon the basals ; the fifth one smaller, resting upon the truncate 

 upper side of the azygous plate, and occupying toward the latter 

 a similar position as the two sections of the compound radials 

 toward each othei*. The smaller radial is transversely penta- 

 gonal, and resembles in outline a bifurcating plate. It supports 

 upon its sloping right side the brachials ; toward the left the 

 A-^entral sac as in locriniis. Brachials generally four to each ray, 

 the upper one axillary, and supporting the two main arms, which 

 sometimes branch again, and give oft' at regular intervals, from 

 alternate sides, strong, arm-like pinnules. All arm joints which 

 have no pinnules are strictly quadrangular, while the pinnule- 

 bearing joints have almost the form of bifurcating plates. 



Axygous plate pentagonal, shorter than adjoining radials. 

 Ventral tube, near the base composed of quadrangular, heav}'- 

 plates, generally longer and narrower than the brachials. The 

 structure of the tube in its upper portions not known. The plates 

 of the ventral side have been observed only in H.juvenis, in which 

 they are composed of five comparatively large interradial pieces, 

 enclosing a small oral plate as in Haplocrinus. Column large, 

 pentagonal, pentapartite, the sutures directed interradially, giving 

 to the segments a radial position. Axial canal large, pentagonal ; 

 angles interradial.^

This form is closely allied to Stenocrinus, but differs from that 

 in two points : the form of its arm appendages, and in the con- 

 struction of its ventral sac. 



The plates of the calyx are arranged as in Stenocrinus, and 

 also the column is strong, pentangular and pentapartite. The 

 arms, which are ten, do not bifurcate, and are provided with stout 

 pinnules, given off alternately from every fourth or fifth plate. The 

 pinnules are long, bifurcating, and extend to the tips of the arms. 



The ventral tube rests upon the left sloping side of the right 

 posterior radial ; it ascends spirally, and in such a manner that 

 adjoining convolutions touch each other, being perhaps suturally 

 connected. It is composed of numerous hexagonal pieces, 

 arranged alternately, and in longitudinal rows. 



Column strong ; indistinctly pentangular ; pentapartite. The 

 older stem joints are rather long pieces which have a well-marked 

 pentapetaloid concavity upon their articular faces. The j^ounger 

 joints consist of five small convex leaflets, disconnected laterally, 

 which fill the concavity of the older joints, exposing to view along 

 the lateral face of the column a small trigonal piece. A similar, 

 if not the same, columnar structure is found in Stenocrinus.^ 



' Ohiocrinus resembles Stenocrinus very closely, and can only be upheld 

 by the form of the ventral tube. We never saw the appendage of Steno- 

 crinus, but Mr. S. A. Miller claims it to be distinct, and this induced us to 

 make the separation.

The genus locrinus must be slightly modified, as stated in our 

 recent notes "on Hybocrinus, Baerocrinus and Hoploerinus.'''' 

 In that paper, to which we refer for further particulars, we gave 

 at some length the reasons which impelled us to regard the large 

 plate, which we had formerly called a radial, as representing the 

 azygous plate, and the smaller pentangular plate above, as the right 

 posterior radial. 



Walcott discovered lately a new generic form, for which he pro- 

 posed the name Merocrinus. It agrees with locrinus in the 

 structure of the azygous side, and would probably be identical 

 with that genus if it had not well-developed underbasals. That 

 underbasals are entirely absent in locrinus is plainly shown by 

 its strictly- pentagonal column, in which the angles have a radial 

 position. 



Revised Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup broadly spreading and per- 

 fectly symmetrical to the top of the second circlet of plates ; it 

 is short, and resembles an inverted pentagonal pyramid with the 

 fiive sides deeply concave. 



Basals small, nearly equal. Radials five, four of them of equal 

 form and height, comparatively large, strong and pentagonal • 

 their upper sides truncated throughout their entire width for the 

 reception of the brachials. Adjoining these radials, in the same 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



ring, is the azygous plate, which has not only the form but gene- 

 ral appearance of the four radials. It supports upon its truncate 

 upper side the fifth radial, that of the right posterior ray. The 

 latter, which resembles in form a large bifurcating plate, sup- 

 ports upon its right upper side the brachials, and toward the 

 left the first plate of the anal tube, being thus a radial, but partly 

 with interradial functions. The radials in all five rays are fol- 

 lowed by five to six brachials, the upper one bifurcating, the 

 others quadrangular, all wider than long, and those of adjoining 

 rays meeting laterally. These are succeeded by the regular arm 

 plates. 



Arms long, gradually tapering to the tips ; bifurcating at regu- 

 lar intervals, and most of their branches bifurcating once or 

 twice again ; each division extending to the general height of the 

 arms. Arm joints quadrangular, resembling those of the brachi- 

 als, but somewhat narrower. 



The ventral sac, at its posterior side, consists of a single row 

 of rather large and strong plates, extending up to the full length 

 of the sac, and forming all the way up a keel-like projection. 

 In general appearance, these plates, which rest against the sloping 

 side of a radial, resemble the brachials and arm plates, although 

 they are somewhat higher and not as wide. Both sides of the 

 ridge-like projection are indented for the reception of other plates. 

 At each side there are two pieces connected to each median plate, 

 one abutting against the middle part, and the other placed oppo- 

 site the suture. These plates are very short and wide, longitu- 

 dinallj^ arranged ; they are curved so as to form a deep transverse 

 groove, their lower sides turned up and forming a transverse 

 ridge. The plates do not meet horizontally, but have a narrow 

 open space at the top of the ridge, which in perfect specimens is 

 covered b}' a row of minute pieces, apparentl}^ with a pore or 

 small opening at the place of juncture with the larger plates. 

 The sac is composed of five rows of these plates, which are con- 

 nected laterally by a straight suture all the way up. 



Column strong, sharply pentagonal, its angles in a line with 

 the radial plates.

This genus differs from the Heterocrinidse in the form of the 

 calyx, which is depressed and not obconical, and in the arrange- 

 ment of the pinnules. It agrees with them in the plates at the 

 azygous side, which we misunderstood in our former description, 

 and this renders a redescription necessary, which we substitute 

 in place of our former one. 



Revised Diagnosis. — General form depressed, cal3x compara- 

 tively large, rather shallow, subglobose ; arrangement of plates 

 extremel}' irregular, scarcel}' two plates being of equal size. 



Basals five, small, subequal, partly hidden b}^ the column. 



Radials irregular, all differing in size and form ; simple or com- 

 pound ; sometimes divided vertically. The left antero-lateral 

 radial is compound, composed of two pieces ; that of the opposite 

 side and the anterior radial are simple. The left postero-lateral 

 radial is the largest plate in the calyx, and either simple or 

 bisected verticall}', composed of two nearly equal parts. The 

 lower segment of the left antero-lateral radial is subquadrangular, 

 the angle along the basi-radial suture being so obtuse as to form 

 almost a straight line ; upper side truncate and slightlj^ convex. 

 The upper segment is irregularl}- hexagonal, truncate above and 

 below, much wider at the lower than at the upper side, widest 

 across the lateral angles. The two together have almost the 

 dimensions of the single radials, but, in place of being wider than 

 high, they are higher than wide, with a narrow concavity for the 

 reception of the brachials. The fifth radial — the right postero- 

 lateral one — rests against the truncate upper side of a large 

 az3-gous plate, and as this stands in line with, and has nearly- form 

 and proportions of the lower section of the compound radial, and 

 the radial plate the form of its upper segment, the two appear in 

 the specimen as if forming jointly another compound radial. 

 (See Diagr. Rev. i, PI. ii). 



There is also among the ra3's a great diversit}- in the number 

 of brachials, and this gives to the specimen that abnormal, irregu- 

 lar outline which is so characteristic of the genus. Some of the 

 rays have two, others three brachials, while the right posterior 

 ray has generally four or more. 




136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



Arms long ; bifurcating at regular intervals ; widely divergent, 

 rather stout at their origin ; tapering upward. They are composed 

 of a succession of rather long, quadrangular pieces, interrupted 

 only by the axillaries which are pentangular, and which divide 

 the main arm, and each division of the arm, into two equal parts. 

 The pinnules are slender, composed of long pieces, given off from 

 every arm joint, but at one side only in succession — not alter- 

 nately-^until the next bifurcation of the arm, when on both 

 divisions they all change to the opposite side. By this arrange- 

 ment there are always 8 to 10 pinnules in succession, first on one 

 side, then on the other. The first pinnule occurs on the second 

 arm plate, not on the first, but every succeeding plate is pinnu- 

 lated with the exception of the bifurcating ones. The proximal 

 pinnule after each bifurcation is considerably heavier and longer, 

 almost arm-like, and bifurcating, the others are simple. The arm 

 furrows are shallow but wide, only one side having sockets for 

 the reception of pinnules.^ 



The ventral sac is tubular, and rests upon the left side of the 

 posterior radial as in the Heterocrinidse. The proximal plate of 

 the tube is large, subquadrangular, and is succeeded by other 

 apparently large pieces. Of the plates at the ventral side little 

 is known. S. A. Miller mentions two rows of small pieces near 

 the ventral tube, but, as nothing is known as to their arrangement, 

 they may be covering plates. 



Column very large, almost circular, pentapartite, highly orna- 

 mented ; central canal large, star-shaped, the projections located 

 interradially. The structure of the column along the axial canal 

 resembles that of Bar-ycrinus and Vasocrmus, with which 

 Anomalocrinus agrees also in the form of the calyx. 



Geological Position^ etc. — Lower Silurian of America. The 

 only known species are : Anomalocrinus caponiformis Lyon, and 

 A. incurvus Meek and Worthen, which have been previously 

 noted. 



Family XX.— BELEMNOCRINID^ S. A. Miller. 



S. A. Miller has proposed for the genus Belemnocrinus a 

 separate family, in which we fully agree. It cannot be placed in 

 any of the other groups, without depriving them of their best 

 distinctive characters. It forms a link between Heterocrinidse 



1 Our descriptions of arms and pinnules in this interesting genus were 

 made from a most beautiful specimen in the collection of J. H. Harris, Esq., 

 of Waynesville, O., who had the kindness to send it to us for description. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



and Cyathocrinidae, resembling the former in the absence of 

 underbasals and in the arm-structure, the Gyathocrinidse in the 

 arrangement of plates at the azygous side and of the ventral 

 tube. As the most characteristic features we mention the 

 extremely small visceral cavit}^ in which the genus resembles 

 Apiocrinus of the Neocrinoidea ; the comparatively large size of 

 the basals ; the absence of underbasals ; the position of the 

 azygous plate in line with the five radials ; the large porous 

 ventral tube, and the condition of the pinnules, which are given 

 off regularly at certain intervals, not alternately from every joint. 



Belemnocrinus was referred by White to the Gyathocrinidse, 

 and he described the calj^x to be composed of three rings of 

 plates. We have shown in 1871 that the part which he took to 

 be the "basals " is the upper stem-joint, and that the dorsal cup 

 consists of only two rings of plates. We further directed atten- 

 tion to the affinities between Belemnocrinus and the recent genus 

 Rhizocrinus, which had been pointed out also by Pourtales, in 

 the Memoirs of the Museum of Comp. Zoology, vol. iv, No. 9, 

 p. 29. The construction of the dorsal cup in the two genera is 

 very similar, however, in JRhizocrinus, the sutures between the 

 basals are fused together; while in Belemnocrinus they are 

 plainly visible, and the former has no anal plate and no ventral sac. 



Belemnocrinus was placed by Zittel among the Poteriocrinidae, 

 although it has neither the arm structure nor the pinnules of that 

 family, nor the azygous plate, and not even underbasals. 



The name Belemnocrinus was used in 18t6 by Munier-Chalmes 

 (Jour. Conch., Ser. 3, vol. xvi, p. 102) for certain basal plates, 

 evidently of a Blastoid, and changed b}'- Oehlert to Belocrinus, 

 1882 (Extr. du Bull. Soc. Geol. de France, Ser, 3, p. 362).

138 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



Basals five, very large, long, narrow, of somewhat irregular 

 shape, forming an ovoid to cylindrical cup. The cup is nearly 

 solid, having only a small central canal, and a shallow subconical 

 excavation at its upper end, the latter forming a part of the 

 visceral cavity. 



Radials five, always smaller than the basals, enclosing an anal 

 plate. They are subquadrangular, slightly excavated at their 

 upper side, and support four (exceptionally five) brachials, of 

 which the upper one is bifurcating and gives off the arms. Arms 

 two to each ray, simple throughout, composed of compound 

 joints, with one or two syzygies in each joint ; the upper segment 

 giving off a strong pinnule. The oblique upper faces of the 

 epizygal or pinnules-bearing joints are arranged alternately, and 

 this gives to the arms a strongly waving, zigzag outline. At the 

 extremities of the arm the pinnules are generally given off from 

 every joint. Pinnules long, arm-like, bifurcating once or twice, 

 like arms. With the arms the pinnules also correspond in length, 

 all of them extending to the same height. 



Anal plate resting between two of the radials and upon one of 

 the basals. This plate, which resembles the radials in form, sup- 

 ports a large ventral sac, composed of numerous hexagonal 

 plates, alternately arranged, with slit-like openings along their 

 lateral edges, which meet with corresponding slits in the adjoin- 

 ing plates. 



Other parts of the ventral side unknown. Column with or 

 without lateral cirrhi; more or less sharply pentangular, the 

 outer angles radial, the rays of the central canal and the columnar 

 cirrhi directed interradially.

(?) HOLOCRINUS W. and Sp. 

 (oXoj solid, Kpivov a lily.) 



The above name is proposed to include a species which was 

 lately described from rather imperfect specimens by Mr. Picard, 

 under the name of Encrinus Beyrichi, but which certainly is no 

 Encrinus. We entertain little doubt that the species must be 

 referred to the Belemnocrinidse ; we are, however, not quite so 

 sure that it is generically distinct from the typical form, which 

 depends upon the presence or absence of the anal plate. No 

 anal plate has been described in this species, and it is more than 

 probable that none was present. It perhaps represents one of 

 those transition forms, which in their earlier life were good Palseo- 

 crinoids, but by resorption of the interradial plates attained, to 

 some extent, the characteristics of the earlier Neocrinoidea. 



Generic Diagnosis} — Dorsal cup strictly pentahedral ; con- 

 stricted above the basals. Basals large, forming an almost solid 

 subglobular body, without underbasals. Radials very small, 

 quadrangular, supporting three to four narrow brachials, the 

 upper one bifurcating. There are two arms to each ray which 

 remain simple. Arms thin, composed of short, cuneate joints, 

 with rather stout pinnules. 



Column pentangular, and, as in Belemnocrinus Jlorifer, pro- 

 vided with long cirrhi, given off at intervals in whorls from the 

 nodal joints, and extending up, and partly covering, the calyx 

 and the lower portions of the arms.

Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup very small ; short and extend-

 joint. 



Underbasals five, comparative!}^ large, seen distinctly in a side 

 view. Basals short, all hexagonal ; alternating with four of the 

 radials and the azygous plate, which all are of similar form, pen- 

 tangular, wider than long. The four radials support upon their 

 truncate upper face a row of brachials, the azygous plate from 

 the same level the fifth radial. The right posterior radial has 

 the same form as the az3^gous plate, but, while the latter is 

 angular below, the radial has an angular upper side, giving ofi* 

 toward the left the ventral tube, and toward the right a row of 

 brachials. There are generally six or more brachials to each 

 ray, composed of short quadrangular pieces, except the upper 

 which is axillary. Arms long, bifurcating ; without pinnules ; 

 tapering toward the tips ; composed of quadrangular joints. 

 The bifurcations take place at regular intervals, and both arms 

 of the same division are of equal size.

In Part I of this Revision we placed Garabocrinus among the 

 doubtful genera. It was founded by E. Billings upon certain 

 peculiarities among plates of the azygous side, resembling other- 

 wise closely Cyathocrinus. When Billings proposed the genus, 

 the azygous side had been observed only in a single specimen. 




1886.] NATUEAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 141 



and as the plates were arranged very differently from those of 

 other genera, we suspected that the tj^pe specimen was a mal- 

 formed or recuperated Gyathocrinus. This view, however, must 

 be given up, since other specimens have been found which show 

 the plates under similar conditions. Mr. Walter R. Billings 

 informed us, in 1880, of the discovery of two more specimens in 

 which the azygous plates were arranged as in E. Billings' type. 

 These specimens were afterwards noticed by him in the Trans- 

 actions of the Ottawa Field Naturalist's Club of 1881, p. 35. 



Carabocrinus was described by E. Billings— using our termin- 

 ology — to be constructed of five underbasals, four of them penta- 

 gonal, the fifth hexagonal ; five basals, three of them hexagonal, 

 one heptagonal and one pentagonal, the latter smaller than the 

 others ; of five radials ; three azygous plates, one of them sup- 

 ported upon the hexagonal unclerbasal, a second upon the small 

 pentagonal basal, the third between two radials. Consulting the 

 generic diagram. Decade iv, p. 30, we find that the small, penta- 

 gonal basal (subradial plate of Billings) has scarcely half the 

 size of the other basals, and the first azygous plate is placed at 

 its left side, contrary to all other Cyathocrinidse. This structure 

 seemed to us so improbable that before accepting it we applied 

 to Prof. Whiteaves of the Canada Survey Museum for the type 

 specimen. We now found that in Billings' diagram the plate in 

 question is represented considerably larger than it is in the 

 specimen, the so-called " azj^gous plate," to the left of the former, 

 smaller, that the basals at their lower sides form in the specimen 

 a much more obtuse angle, almost a straight line, and that the 

 underbasals are comparativel}^ smallei\ 



From our diagram it will be seen, that the second or basal ring 

 really consists of six plates, four of them equal, the fifth one nearly 

 as high but somewhat narrower, the sixth subquadrangular, small, 

 not more than half the size of the former. That the latter piece 

 which is united with the azygous plate bj^ a horizontal suture is 

 a basal — subradial of Billings — seems to us exceedingly doubtful, 

 the more as the adjoining plate meets all the requirements of a 

 basal. This plate, which Billings called the first az^-gous jDiece, 

 and which we take to be the posterior basal in conformit}' with 

 other Cj^athocrinidse, has an az3'gous plate at its right side, 

 and this supports with its right upper sloping side a special anal 

 plate. The small plate within the basal ring, which is only known 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



in this genus, is, we think, a supplementary azjgous plate of no 

 fundamental importance, a plate bearing to the regular azygous 

 plate similar relations as the small accessory interradials in some 

 specimens of Arclxseocrinus sculptus to the regular interradials. 



We offer the following : — 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Underbasals five, of variable form 

 and size ; four of them quadrangular, but only three equal ; the 

 fourth one, that facing the azygous side, narrower; the fifth pen- 

 tagonal, truncate above. Carabocrinus is closely allied to Den- 

 docrinus and Homocrinus, but differs from both in the number 

 and arrangement of its azygous plates. 



Basals five, four of them hexagonal ; the one toward the right 

 of the azygous plates heptagonal ; that on the left side somewhat 

 smaller, truncate below, and occupying the full width of the upper 

 side of the pentagonal underbasal. 



Eadials heptagonal, the upper side excavated for the reception 

 of the brachials, which occupy about one-third the width of the 

 plate. The brachials, so far as known, consist of two or some- 

 times three pieces, the upper one sharply wedgeform. Arms, 

 compared with the size of the cal3''x, remarkably short ; composed 

 of quadrangular joints with parallel sutures ; bifurcating; tapering 

 gradually to their tips. The branching is similar to that of Gya- 

 thocrinus, and the arms throughout, as in that genus, are devoid 

 of pinnules. 



Plates at the azygous side three. A supplementary azygous 

 plate rests between the basals and extends to half their height. 

 The regular azygous plate is placed between the upper lateral 

 portions of the five basals, and upon the supplementary piece ; 

 supporting with its left upper side the anal plate, with its right 

 side the right postero-lateral radial. The anal plate resembles the 

 radials in form and proportion, but its upper face is irregularly 

 convex, and is bordered by a row of small pieces which form 

 a part of the ventral tube. 



Column comparatively small, obscurely pentangular, with a 

 large, sharply pentagonal canal. The column is quinquepartite, 

 the sutures arranged alternately with those of the underbasals. 



Locality, Position, etc. — Known only from the Trenton lime- 

 stone of Canada, but we found detached plates, apparently of this 

 genus, in rocks of the same age near Knoxville, Tenn.

This is one of the few genera of the Cyathocrinidse which have 

 only three underbasals, and this distinguishes it readily from 

 Homocrinus, with which it agrees in the plates of the azygous 

 side. 



Generic Diagnosis.- — Underbasals three, two equal and with 

 truncate upper sides ; the third one-half smaller, angular above. 

 Basals five ; two of them resting entirely upon the two large 

 underbasals ; pentagonal ; the two alternating with them hexa- 

 gonal ; the posterior one, which has a truncate upper side, hep- 

 tagonal. The latter is larger and supports toward the right a 

 pentangular azygous plate ; at its truncate upper side a large anal 

 piece ; along the left side a radial. The azygous plate is followed 

 by the anal plate, which is laterally connected with the right pos- 

 terior radial. The radials are pentagonal, with a small semi- 

 circular excavation for the reception of the arms. Onl}^ one 

 brachial is known, which is quadrangular and extremely small. 

 All other parts are unknown.

 the t.vpe-specimen in the Canada Survey Museum, we found it to be a good 

 Dendrocrinus. Toward the right of the basals, underneath the postero- 

 lateral radial, it has a good-sized azygous plate, which at its left sloping 

 upper side supports an anal piece, exactly as in Dendrocrinus. The species 

 has a strong ventral tube, of which only the transverse section is seen.

This genus lias been latel}^ so often confounded with Poferio- 

 crinus, that for better information, we point out their distinctive 

 characters. Homocrinus differs from Poteriocrinus in the more 

 slender form of the calyx, in having no plates of the ventral tube 

 within the line of the first radials, in being provided with horse- 

 shoe-shaped articular facets, pierced by a round dorsal canal, and 

 in having at least three brachials. Contrarj^ to Poteriocrinus, 

 the arms are not pinnulated, and they are composed of quadran- 

 gular joints with parallel lines of union. Its relations are much 

 closer with Parisocrinus, which, however, has no separate dorsal

PARISOCRINUS W. and Sp., Rev. i, p. 115. 



Closely allied to Homocrinus is Parisocrinus, which we made 

 a subsection of Poteriocrinus. In doing so, we were not aware 

 that this form is devoid of pinnules. In our descriptions we 

 only pointed out the great resemblance which it has to Cyatho- 

 crinus, especially in the branching of the arms, but finding the 

 azygous side constructed as in Poteriocrinus, we placed it with 

 that genus. More perfect specimens which have since been dis- 

 covered leave not the least doubt that it is very distinct from 

 Poteriocrinus, and a true Cyathocrinoid. 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — General form turbinate. Under- 

 basals large, equal. Basals five, three of them hexagonal ; the 

 two connecting with the azj^gous side heptagonal. The radials 

 are rarely larger than the basals ; four of them are equal, the fifth 

 one has an additional side for the reception of the lower plate of 

 the ventral tube. Articular face horseshoe-shaped, supporting a 

 row of three brachials, of which the upper one is axillary. Arms 

 composed of long slender joints, branching like those of Cyatho- 

 crinus and without pinnules. The azygous side is arranged as 

 in Poteriocrinus, with three plates in the calyx. Ventral tube 

 long, cylindrical, composed of alternately arranged rows of hexa- 

 gonal pieces, with a pore at each angle. Column round. 



Geological Position, etc. — Subcarboniferous. America and 

 England. 



We place here Parisocrinus intermedius, P. nereus, P. per- 

 plexus, P. tenuibrachiatus, P. quinquangularis, P. radiatus and 

 P. salignoideus ; but Poteriocrinus curtus, which we referred to 

 it in Pt, I, p. 115, is a Homocrinus.

We have had, for several years, a very remarkable Crinoid 

 from the Burlington limestone, which could not be placed in any 

 of the established genera. At first we took it to be an abnormal 

 specimen, with only four radials, and a small non-arm-bearing 




146 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



plate at the anterior side, and therefore did not describe it. It 

 resembles Belemnocrinus in its general appearance, but differs in 

 having underbasals, and curiously enough, these have a similar 

 cylindrical form, and are as solid as the basals in that interesting 

 genus. 



We have since obtained from the Burlington and Keokuk transi- 

 tion bed near Burlington, and from the lower part of the Keokuk 

 limestone proper of Tennessee, two additional specimens, clearly 

 of the same genus, but of a different species. Both specimens 

 show the same irregular structure, i. e., four arm-bearing radials, 

 and in line with them a small azygous, non-arm-bearing plate, 

 thus proving that the apparent irregularity is a persistent char- 

 acter. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Form of calyx elongate, bell-shaped, the 

 sides concave, constricted along the suture between basals and 

 underbasals. Underbasals five, large, forming an almost solid 

 ovo-cylindrical body, pierced only by a longitudinal canal. Basals 

 long and narrow, widening above, irregular in form ; three of 

 them hexagonal, two heptagonal. Radials four, of nearly equal 

 size, with an obtuse facet covering the greater part of the width 

 of the plate. Anterior radial non-arm-bearing. Like the regular 

 radials, it alternates with the basals, has the same general height, 

 but less than half their width. Brachials from two to four, ex- 

 ceptionall}'- five ; comparatively strong ; with parallel articular 

 lines, except the upper one, which is axillary. Main arms eight, 

 which from every second joint, alternately, give off armlets, or 

 arm-like pinnules of less than half the size of the main arms, but 

 extending to the same height and branching. The arm joints, 

 from which the branches are given off, are formed almost like 

 axillary plates, one side, however, being shorter and slightly more 

 obtuse. Tiie alternate joints are quadrangular. Whether these 

 and the axillaries are united by sj^zygy, could not be ascertained 

 from the specimens. 



Azygous plate large, resting between the upper sloping sides of 

 two basals, and against the right posterior radial. It supports 

 towards the left the anal plate, and at its truncate itjjper side the 

 first plate of the tube: Nothing is known of the ventral side. 

 Column obtusely pentangular, with a medium-sized central canal. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 147 



Attelesocrinus delioatus, nov. sp 



Calj'x bell-shaped ; twice as high as wide, greatly constricted 

 along the sutures between basals and underbasals. Underbasals 

 forming a comparatively long ovo-cjdindrical body. Basal cup 

 funnel-shaped, resting upon the underbasals as if proceeding from 

 their inner cavity. The basals are delicate plates, elongate, gradu- 

 ally increasing in width. Arm-bearing radials wider than high ; 

 each one supporting two brachials. The latter fill nearly the 

 entire width of the preceding plate, and are twice as wide as the 

 true arm plates. Anterior radial narrow, less than half the width 

 of the arm-bearing radials. Arms two to the ray, tapering 

 gradually to their tips, where they become extremely delicate; 

 they have a waving outline, are composed of long joints, and 

 give off armlets alternately from every second plate. All armlets 

 extend to the tips of the arms, and branch once or twice. Their 

 size along the lower part of the arms is only half that of the main 

 arms, bvit higher up the}^ are of almost equal thickness. Column 

 obtusely pentangular. 



Geological Position, etc. — Lower Burlington limestone. Burling- 

 ton, Iowa. 



Atelestocrinus robustus, uov. sp., PI. 9, fig. 4. 



Larger and much more robust than the preceding species ; less 

 constricted between basals and underbasals; the form of the 

 latter, taken together, more oblate. Basals twice as long as wide. 

 Arm-bearing radials heavy, wider than high ; the anterior radial 

 less than one-third the size of the others, hexagonal. Azygous 

 side with four plates in the calyx, two of them constituting parts 

 of the ventral tube ; alternately arranged. Brachials four ; three 

 of them quadrangular, the upper one axillary ; all rather large, 

 but decreasing in size upwards. Arms long, comparatively heavy 

 at the base, but tapering rapidlj^ to the tips, where they become 

 very delicate. They are composed of quadrangular, rounded 

 joints, with parallel sutures, giving off armlets alternately from 

 every second joint. The armlets are much thinner, and more 

 pinnule-like than in A. delicatus, but extend like those to the 

 height of the arms, and bifurcate in a similar manner. 



Geological Position, etc. — Burlington and Keokuk Transition 

 bed near Burlington, Iowa, and at the base of the Keokuk 

 limestone, White's Creek Spring, near Nashville, Tennessee.

The name Ophiocrinus is preoccupied by Salter, who proposed 

 it in 1856 for a Rhodocrinoid from Southern Africa, which, how- 

 ever, is not properly defined. Semper also used the name in 

 1868 for a Neocrinoid, and again Charlesworth, but without pub- 

 lishing the description. The Swedish form, therefore, requires a 

 new name, for which we adopt Streptocrinus, in allusion to the 

 convoluted state of the ventral tube.

BARYCRINTJS Wachsmuth, Rev. I, p. 99. 



The genus Barycrinus differs from other Cyathocrinidae in 

 having a shallow calyx, constructed of heavy plates, arms massive, 

 and composed of short joints. These differences are so marked 

 that we have strong doubts whether it ought to be placed in this 

 famil3^ 



The diagram of Barycrinus, PI. I, fig. 3, in Part I of this 

 Revision, is incorrect as to the axial canal, which should have 

 shown the processes radial, instead of interradial. On page 101, 

 of Part I, we were made to say that the sections of the column 

 of Barycrinus are radial and the sutures interradial, whereas it 

 should be that the sections of the column are " interradial and 

 the sutures radial ; the opposite of Heterocrinus, in which they 

 are interradial." 



No new species have been described since our list, but Arach- 

 nocrinus bulbosus (Hall), W. and Sp., was referred by S. A. Miller 

 erroneously to Barycrinus. 



Gyathocrinus subtumidus M. and W., which we took to be a 

 Barycrinus, must be changed back to Gyathocrinus. The species 

 is closely allied to Gyathocrinus barydactylus W. and Sp.

Through the kindness of Prof. Whiteaves we had an oppor- 

 tunity to examine E. Billings' type specimens of Palseocrinus in 

 the Canada Survey Museum. The specimen of P. striatus, upon 

 which tlie genus was proposed, is very imperfect, and may be a 

 Caraboci'inus, Dendrocrinus, or a new genus. The construction at 

 the ventral side, to which E. Billings attached so much weight, is 

 that of the Cyathocrinidoe generally. They nearly all have ventrally 

 five interradial plates resting against the radials, and alternate 

 rows of covering plates. Heretofore we have placed Palseocrinus 

 angulatus Billings under Gyathocrinus, but we satisfied ourselves 

 from the original specimen that it is a true Dendrocrinus. — Gyatho- 

 crinus fasciatus Hall, is a synonym of Macrostylocrinus Meehi; 

 Gyathocrinus hamiltonensis Worthen, a synonym of Gyathocrinus 

 parvihrachiatus Hall. G. nucleus and G. polyxo Hall are now 

 referred by us to Homocrinus ; G. waldronensis to Macrostylo- 

 crinus. — Gyathocrinus grajihicus Bigshy (not Hall) is Platycrinus

18T9. (?) Gyathocrinus Harris! S. A. Miller, Journ. Cincin. Soc. Nat. Hist., vol. ii, 

 PI. 15, fig. 2. — Keokuk limest. Crawfordsville, Ind. 



We leave this species for the present under Gyathocrinus, al- 

 though aware that it represents a very different generic form. In 

 some respects the species closely resembles Belemnocrinus 

 Jlorifer, and might almost be considered identical with it, if the 

 column did not indicate a dicyclic base. The column of both 

 species is sharply pentagonal, and beautifully fringed with whorls 

 of cirrhi, but while in Belemnocrinus fiorifer the outer angles of 

 the column are directed radially, the cirrhi interradially, the very 

 opposite is the case in Gyathocrinus (?) Harrisi. Neither can 

 the species be referred to our genus Atelestocrinus, as this is 

 remarkable for its large underbasals, nor in fact to any other 

 known to us, and we should make it the type of a new genus if 

 the two specimens which we examined were more perfect. The 

 specimen in the collection of Mr. Harris, which he had the kind- 

 ness to send us for examination, leaves us in doubt whether the 

 so-called azygous plate of Miller does not represent the anterior 

 radial. Among the Fistulata the anterior ray very frequently 

 supports a single arm, which either remains simple or branches

on a level witli the second bifurcation in the other rays, and this 

 may be the case here. Miller in describing the species, we think, 

 had in mind the Silurian genus locrinus^ in which the plates of 

 the ventral sac take the form of arm plates, but these are given off 

 laterally from the azygous plate and not, as it would be here, 

 from the truncated upper side of the anal piece.

(?) SPH.ffi;ROCRINTJS Roemer. 



In referring Sphxrocrinus to the genus Cyathocrinus (Rev. I, 

 p. 83), we overlooked the fact that Roemer 's type has separate 

 dorsal canals piercing the radials. Whether this character is 

 sufficient for generic distinction is a question which has never 

 been brought up for discussion. It is in this regard worthy of 

 notice that this structure occurs exclusively in species from the 

 Silurian and Upper Devonian, never in the Carboniferous, neither 

 in Cyathocrinus nor other genera. Whether all species of Cyatho- 

 crinus from Gothland and Dudley possess this structure, cannot 

 be ascertained from the figures, but if they do, it may form the 

 basis of a separation which seems to us very desirable. If the 

 genus Spheerocrinus is accepted, it will probablj' include not only 

 Sphserocrinus geometricus Goldfuss, Roemer's typical species, 

 but many others.

 In our former list we erroneously placed Poteinocrinus pisi-

 it is a Lecanocrinus.

Schultze in defining this genus thought it to be closely allied 

 to Gasterocoma, and Zittel and de Loriol place it among the 

 Gasterocomidce. In our opinion, the similarity between Gastero- 

 coma and Achradocrinus is more superficial than real. Gastero- 

 coma has five underbasals, and the column in addition to the 

 axial canal is provided with four peripheral vessels, which are 

 altogether unrepresented in the other form. The two agree only 

 in the position of the anal aperture. The affinities of Achrado- 

 crinus are much closer with Sphserocrinus, from which it dififers 

 only, as far as known, in the position of the anal plate. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup deeply cup-shaped ; symmetry 

 decidedly bilateral. Underbasals five, equal, of medium size, 

 extending beyond the column, and visible in a side view. Basals 

 five, four of them angular above, the posterior one truncate, and 

 supporting an anal plate. Radials all meeting laterally, three of 

 them equal ; the two postero-lateral ones deeply excavated for the 

 reception of the anal plate, which they inclose on three sides by 

 meeting above. The radials are slightly notched at their upper 

 margin, and have upon the outer side of the plate a narrow, 

 horseshoe-like articular facet, pierced by a small dorsal canal, 

 which is located at some distance from the notch. At the azygous 

 side there is only an anal plate, which is subquadrangular, its 

 lateral margins arched, its upper face narrower and excavated for 

 the ventral sac, which is cylindrical and placed between this plate 

 and the lateral extensions of adjoining radials. The tube has a 

 ventral position owing to the strongly inflected upper portions of 

 the radials. Arms unknown. Column circular ; with a small 

 central canal. 



The only known species is :

Codiacrinus is closely allied to Achradocrinus ; the anal plate, 

 however, is here, we think, fully resorbed bj'^ the radials, and the 

 basals consist only of three plates. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Of small size ; in the form of a poppy-head, 

 reversed bell-shaped, or subovoid. Plates thin. Symmetry 

 strictly pentamerous. 



Underbasals three, forming a pentagon ; two of them larger 

 and hexagonal, the third smaller and rhomboidal. Basals equal, 

 pentangular. Radials equal; all touching laterally; upper face 

 concave, with a narrow semicircular lateral articular facet for the 

 reception of the brachials, and with a separate dorsal canal. 

 There is no anal plate in the dorsal cup. Nothing is known of 

 the ventral side, nor of the arms.

This name must not be confounded with Lecythocrinus, Miiller,

 such similar names, even if permitted by the generally accepted 

 rules, should be avoided. The species for which it was proposed 

 agrees in the arrangement of its calyx plates with Codiacrinus, 

 except the articular facet of the radials, which is wider, directed 

 upwards (not obliquely as in that genus), and it has distinct liga- 

 mentous fossae, but apparently no central canal.

Family XXII.— POTERIOCRINID^. 



It has been stated that the distinction between Poteriocrinidse 

 and C3^athocrinid8e is based principally upon their different mode 

 of articulation. The articulation, however, in the Poteriocrinidse 

 undergoes certain modifications, and toward the close of the Car- 

 boniferous even the calj'x begins to show signs of being capable 

 of slight expansion, if not mobility, the plates being frequently 

 provided with a fossa along their margins ; while in others the 

 plates are united by sj'zj^gy. Those fossae which extend over the 

 whole surface of the opposed faces not only occur between the 

 radials, but extend in a vertical direction to the basi-radial suture. 

 That they lodged bundles of ligament is almost beyond doubt, 

 and Dr. P. H. Carpenter, whom we consulted on this subject, 

 regards this union as a suture, but "less close, with longer liga- 

 ments, and therefore more expansible and movable, than in an 

 ordinary suture." A syzygial union is found among the species 

 which Trautschold referred to the genus Gromyocrinus^ and 

 seems to extend in some of them even to the suture between 

 basals and underbasals, the striation being plainly visible along 

 the suture lines. In some of these genera the articulation between 

 brachials and arm plates is as highly differentiated as in most of 

 the NeociVnoidea, and much more so than in some of them. 



The progressive development in the mode of articulation that 

 takes place from the earlier to the later Poteriocrinidse is, no 

 doubt, of some classificatory value, but we have not been able, 

 as yet, to separate them on this ground, as the respective parts 

 are generally in an imperfect state of preservation, and there 

 appear to be no other distinguishing characters. Moreover, a 

 comparison of the earlier Poteriocrinidse, such as Scytalocrinus, 

 ScaphiocriJius, Pachylocrinus, Coeliocrinus and Graphiocrinus, 

 with the latter genera Eupachycrivus, Zeacrinus, Hydreionocri- 

 nus, Geriocrinus, Erisocrinus, and of the latter with Encrinus, 

 shows that the two sections shade into one another by such easy 

 gradations, that in many cases it is absolutely impossible to draw 

 a dividing line. 



The genera of the Poteriocrinidse are principally based upon 

 the arrangement of the plates at the azygous side, the form of 

 the calj'x, the proportionate size of the ventral sac, and the 

 branching of the arms. Some of the genera have a well-developed 

 azygous plate, a special anal piece, and one of the plates support- 



11 




154 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



ing the ventral sac enclosed within the calyx. Others, such as 

 Graphiocrinus and Geriocrinus, have no azygous plate, but only 

 an anal piece ; while in Erisocrinus^ Stemmatocrinus and Encri- 

 nus no such plate is found, either within the ring of radials or 

 below. In the same degree as palaeontologically the calyx grows 

 more symmetrical, the ventral sac decreases in size, and probably 

 disappeared entirely in Encrinus, which is closely allied to the 

 Poteriocrinidae. Along with these modifications, others are going 

 on which take place in the arms. Throughout every genus, a 

 development goes on from the uniserial to the biserial arm struc- 

 ture, a feature which has not been observed in any other family 

 of the Fistulata, and which has no parallel throughout the Neo- 

 crinoidea if we exclude Encrinus, which we regard as a somewhat 

 higher developed Poteriocrinoid. Encrinus, especially, offers in 

 its arm structure a very striking example. Among its species 

 are found arms in all stages of development, some having single 

 quadrangular joints, others two rows closely arranged. The 

 same variations are found in the arms of Etipachycriuus, Gerio- 

 crinus and Erisocrinus ; while in the earlier Poteriocrinites the 

 arms never pass beyond the interlocking stage. That the biserial 

 arm structure was developed from single cuneate joints, and not 

 only palseontologically, but also in the growing animal, we had 

 opportunity to observe in a very young Encrinus liliiformis, in 

 which the arms, to about two-thirds their height, are composed 

 of single joints, which gradually become more cuneate, and 

 toward the tips are interlocking. This one case, we think, alone 

 would be sufficient evidence to prove that the biserial arm struc- 

 ture is the higher form, if it was not confirmed by other speci- 

 mens of this and other groups. If Encrinus were a Neocrinoid, 

 as supposed by Zittel, De Loriol and Carpenter, the Neocrinoidea 

 would begin their existence with the highest differentiated arms 

 known to us, and the arms of all other Neocrinoidea up to the 

 Comatulae of the present seas, would appear to have remained 

 persistently in their larval state. This does not seem to us to 

 favor the idea of Encrinus being a Neocrinoid. 



Comparing EiHsocrinus with Encrinus, the only noticeable 

 difference in their fossil state is the presence of a single brachial 

 in the former, and two in the latter. To this P. H. Carpenter 

 alluded (Chall. Rep., p. 154), admitting it to be "the only point 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 155 



of difference about which we are enabled to speak with certainty." 

 This character, however, is not restricted to Encrinus; we find it 

 more or less among all Poteriocriuidae, but exclusively there and 

 in the Encrinidae. The two brachials are always joined by suture, 

 not by articulation, and this is the case in Encrinus, in which the 

 two pieces are united by sj'zygy and form actually one plate. 

 The compound brachial is scarcely more than a specific character, 

 and hence has no value as a distinction between two orders. 



Carpenter takes not only Encrinus^ but also Erisocrinus and 

 Stemmatocrinus to be Neoci-inoidea, because they have no anal 

 plate. Anal plates, he states, " are absent in Erisocrinus as in 

 Encrinus, and since a ventral tube or sac like that of Cyatho- 

 crinus is always found associated with a system of anal plates, 

 the lowest of which is intercalated between two radials, it seems 

 rash to postulate its presence in the symmetrical Erisocrinus.'" 

 That our conclusions were not so " rash " as Carpenter suggested 

 is emphatically proved b}" the fact that an anal plate has actually 

 been disco.vered by Dr. White in Erisocrinus. It is located above 

 the radials, being enclosed among the interradial plates, where we 

 should have expected it from analogy with other groups. Anal 

 plates are absent also in two genera of the Cyathocrinid?e, in 

 Godiacrinus Schultze, and Lecythiocriniis White, which both 

 have a perfectly symmetrical dorsal cup. But does that make 

 them Neocrinoidea ? What more do we know of the ventral struc- 

 ture of the Poteriocrinidse than of Encrinus and Erisocrinus'^ 

 If Encrinus is a Xeocrinoid, why not all Poteriocriuidae ? No- 

 body ever saw the ventral covering in sluj Poteriocrinoid — we 

 have only found the ventral sac. Yet from analogy with Gyatho- 

 crinus and allied forms in which a vault has actually been ob- 

 served, it was generally supposed that vault plates were present 

 also in the Poteriocriuidae. We think the width of the brachials, 

 which in this family frequently occup}^ the entire width of the 

 radials, gives a satisfactory explanation why the vault plates are 

 not preserved in forms like these. The plates either rested against 

 the sloping edges of the radials as in Stemmatocrinus Traut- 

 scholdi, or only against their articular extensions as in Symbatho- 

 crinus. It is even very possible that the interradials were par- 

 tially or wholly resorbed by the muscular processes of the 

 radials, as these became developed in the growing Crinoid. 



The subdivisions of Foteriocrinus, which we proposed, have 




156 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



been accepted by Wetherby and Williams, but ignored by S. A. 

 Miller and Prof. Worthen.i 



Extensive collections made b}^ us during the last two years, 

 enable us to give additional information respecting these divi- 

 sions. Farisocrinus proves to be not only a good genus, but, 

 moreover, is a Cyathocrinoid, having no pinnules. Pachylocrinus 

 is closer allied to Zeacrinus than to Poteriocrmus, and is proba- 

 bly identical with Philocrinus. De Koninck described this genus 

 with a monocyclic base, and the calyx strictly pentahedral, but 

 from appearance it had underbasals and azygous plates, and is 

 identical with Pachylocrinus. We have redefined Scytalocrinus 

 and Decadocrinus, which should both be ranked as subgenera 

 under Poteriocrinus, and likewise Scaphiocrinus. 



Mr. Percy Sladen, in a paper " On the genus Poteriocrinus and 

 allied forms " (read before the Geol. and Polyt. Soc. at Yorkshire 

 in 187 T), separated the English Carboniferous Poteriocrinites 

 into four groups : Poteriocrinus^ Dactylocrinus, Scaj)hiocrinus 

 and Zeacrinus. To the typical form he referred : P. crassus, P. 

 spissus, P. conicus. P. pUcatus, P. impressus, P. radiatus and P. 

 quinquangularis. We agree with him as to the first four species, 

 but we think the last three are Cyathocrinidse and should be 

 referred to Parisocrinus. Mr. Sladen, unfortunately, figured 



1 S. A. Miller, in the 2d Ed. of his Catal. of Pal. Foss., called them 

 " subgenera of doubtful utility." Prof. Worthen gives the following rea- 

 sons for refusing their acceptance (Bull, i, Illinois St. Mas. Nat. Hist., p. 

 4): "First, I see no beneficial result that is likely to come from cumbering 

 the nomenclature of paleontology with such terms, and secondly, because 

 any proposed subgeneric formula that groups together such diverse forms 

 as Zeacrinus maniformi% Y. and Sh., and Poteriocrinus Biselli Worthen, 

 can be of no practical advantage in the study of this group of Crinoids, and 

 hence, until some satisfactory generic characters can be pointed out by 

 which they may be separated, it seems advisable to include them all under 

 the generic name originally proiiosed by Miller for them." If our good 

 friend had read our paper more carefully, he would have observed that we 

 proposed our six subdivisions of Poteriocrinus with the distinct statement 

 that we "scarcely deemed the characters upon which they are based sufti- 

 ciently important even for subgeneric separation," and that we alluded in 

 detail to the difficulty of referring the " Zeacrinus " maniformis to any of 

 the sections. In i)roposing these subdivisions, however, we only followed 

 the suggestion of Meek and Worthen in 1869 CProc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 

 p. 138 and note), where, after defining Scaphiocrinus, Zeacrinus and Calio- 

 crinus as subgenera under Poteriocrinus, they add, under the head of Scaphio- 

 crinus : "The group, however, has been extended by Prof. Hall and others 

 so as to include species presenting all the characters given above, and might 

 be divided into several sections, distinguished from each other and from the

Parisocrinus radiatus to illustrate the genus Poteriocrinus, a spe- 

 cies without pinnules, with the arms of a Gyathocrinus, but with 

 a Po^eriocWn us arrangement of azygous plates. IJnder Dactylo- 

 crinus he included P. tenuis, both of Miller and Austin, T. isaco- 

 bus and P. 7'ostratus, Austin (pars), Monogr. Rec. and Foss. Crin. 

 PI. 9, figs. 2b,c (non 2 a, d). Comparing Austin's P. tenuis, 

 which Sladen redescribed as Dactylocrinus loreus, with " Poterio- 

 crinus " radiatus, there appears to be considerable difference 

 between the two forms, but comparing it with P. crassus, Miller's 

 typical species, the difference is not so very great. Austin's figure 

 apparently was made from a very .young specimen, as indicated by 

 the unusually long arm joints, and it may be a somewhat aber- 

 rant form of Scytalocrinus. Sladen 's name Dactylocrinus would 

 have priority over Scytalocrinus, had not Quenstedt in 18T6 used 

 the same name for a different form. P. isacobus is, in our opinion, 

 a good Poteriocrinus. Sladen refers to ScapJiiocrinus : P. latifrons, 

 Austin, which we take to be a Pachylocrinus ; and to Zeacrinus : 

 Gupressocrinus impressus (Gupressocrinus calyx, McCoy) ; Pote- 

 riocrinus Mc Goyanus, a.nd Zeacrimcs Phillipsi. We agree with 

 him as to the latter species, but we doubt if the other three are 

 sufficiently known to assert whether the calices belong to either 

 Zeacrinus, Eupachycrinus or Hydreionocrinus. 



typical form, on quite as good characters as those distinguishing the latter 

 from Zeacrinus.'''' At the time of J. S. Miller the genus Poteriocrinus was 

 fully sufficient to hold every species then known, but for each species then 

 known one hundred have been discovered since. 



When Tve attempted to revise the Poteriocrinites we foimd a confusion 

 such as existed in no other group of the Palaeocrinoidea, The subdivisions 

 that had been proposed were so indistinctly defined, and contained such 

 diverse elements, that they rather increased the difficulty instead of diminish- 

 ing it. As a temporary remedy we proposed our subdivisions, and expect- 

 ing they would eventually prove to be distinct genera, we applied to them 

 at once generic names. It was at the option of Prof. Worthen to accept 

 these divisions or not, but in adding some fifty or more species to the three 

 hundred already described, he surely would have aided in the identification 

 of his species, and science generally, by referring them to those groups. 

 This would have lightened the labors of others, who are now compelled to 

 look up for comparison every one of his species. Besides, if Prof. Worthen 

 had consulted tfie Revision, he might have avoided a number of synonyms 

 which "cumber the nomenclature of paleontology " more seriously than 

 those few systematic names. It is somewhat curious that after refusino- 

 to accept the subgenera proposed by us and Prof. Hall, Prof. Worthen 

 repeatedly employs the specific names which had already been used by 

 previous writers in one or the other of those subgenera.

Dorsal cup obconical to semi-ovoid ; all its plates closely united 

 by suture. Radials truncate above, the articular ridge filling 

 almost the entire width of the ujDper face. Brachials long, simple 

 or compound, similar in form to the radials but truncate below; 

 line of articulation gaping. In species with compound brachials, 

 the two segments have the form and proportions of the one plate 

 in the others, and are joined by suture. Arms long, branching; 

 arm joints rather long, wedge-form. Azygous side as in Poterio- 

 crinus. Column obtusely pentagular. 



Poteriocrinus Jesujn Whitfield, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist. N. Y., 

 Bull, i (Decbr., 1881), is evidently a synonym of P. Swallovi M. 

 and W. (compare 111. Rep., ii, PL 16, fig. 4), although Whitfield 

 thinks it distinct in the bifurcation of the arms, and in the number 

 and arrangement of the anal plates. In the type specimen of P. 

 Swallovi only two bifurcations of the arms were preserved, and 

 Meek and Worthen remarked on p. 84, that the arms in the upper 

 parts " seemed to be simple " in this species. The latter is not 

 confirmed by our specimens, of which many have arms and ven- 

 tral sac beautifully preserved ; they all show essentially the same 

 bifurcations as Whitfield's specimen. Slight variation in the num- 

 ber of arm joints in one of the bifurcations cannot be regarded 

 as a good specific character, and even an additional division 

 of the arms may take place in the same species. The apparent 

 variation in the number of " anal " plates is explained by the fact 

 that in the type of P. Swallovi the arms accidentally cover the 

 lower portion of the ventral sac, exposing to view only four plates ; 

 while in Whitfield's specimen a much greater portion of the ven- 

 tral sac is visible.

The ventral side of Woodocrinus has not been observed, but 

 we may suppose from the spreading of the arms that its sac was 

 rather bulk}-. This is further suggested by the great width of 

 the azygous side, which, however, is composed of the same 

 elements as in most Poteriocrinites, and is not structurally dis- 

 tinct as has been generally supposed. It has, like Poteriocrinus, 

 within the calyx three azygous plates — the succeeding pieces 

 forming the abactinal parts of the ventral sac — which for some 

 distance, are exposed between the arms. It differs from Scaphio- 

 crinus in the shortness of its arm joints and arms generally. 

 This it shares, however, with Fachylocrinus as defined by us, and 

 with Zeacrinus Troost. 




164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



In our description of Zeacrinus (Rev. i, p. 125), we stated the 

 difficulty of separating it from Woodocrinus. The only differ- 

 ence, there noted, was the folding up and the smaller size of the 

 arms in the former, and upon this distinction almost exclusively 

 we based the separation. We also stated that the caljx in 

 Woodocrinus was generally more turbinate, in Zeacrinus de- 

 pressed with concave basal regions, but also to this rule we 

 foimd exceptions among the species which had been referred 

 to the latter. Equally impracticable would be a separation 

 upon the arm joints, although these var^'^ considerably among 

 the typical species. The arms of Zeacrinus magnoliaformis are 

 dorsally perfectly flat, those of Woodoci^inus macrodactylus 

 decidedly rounded, and Hall, Meek, Worthen and White placed 

 under Zeac7'inus species with flat, rounded and angular arms. 



The species which we arranged in Pt. i, under Pachylocrinus, 

 had been originally, with a few exceptions, described under 

 Zeacrinus, Their arms, like those of the latter, are more or less 

 closely folded up, and they dichotomize in a similar manner. All 

 are composed of short quadrangular joints, and all have a club- or 

 elongate balloon-shaped, ventral sac ; while the sac in Zeacrinus 

 magnoliaformis is pj^ramidal, with sharp lateral edges and concave 

 sides. In the latter the form of the calyx is disk-like, in the 

 others bowl-shaped. Mr. Percy Sladen, the only English writer 

 who advocated the necessity of subdividing the original genus 

 Poteriocrinus ^ placed Poteriocrinus McCoyanus, P. calyx, P. 

 granulosus and P. Phillipsii under Zeacrinus. We fully agree 

 with him that these four species cannot be retained under Poterio- 

 crinus, having close affinities with Zeacrinus, but we believe the 

 three former will prove to be Hydreionocrinus, his Zeacrinus 

 Phillipsii a Pachylocrinus or Woodocrinus, as also Poteriocrinus 

 latifrons AvTstin, which he referred to Scaphiocrinus. Sladen 

 probably was not acquainted with Troost's type of Zeacrinus. as 

 he took Z. elegans to be a typical form, an opinion in which we 

 have shared until quite recently, when we obtained numerous 

 beautifully-preserved specimens, both of '^Zeacrinus " elegans and 

 Troost's typical species, from the Kaskaskia limestone. The 

 later forms differ from the earlier not onlj^ in the form of their 

 ventral sac, but also essentially in the construction of their 

 calyx. In the typical species the dorsal cup is disk-like, almost 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 165 



flat, the radials extremely large, touching with their acute lower 

 angles the underbasals, thereby almost isolating the five basals. 

 The basals in these species consist of minute trigonal pieces of 

 irregular form, and also the underbasals are small, and rest 

 deeply within the columnar concavity (PL 6, fig. 9). In the 

 earlier form, notably " Zeacrinus " elegans, however, the basal 

 cup is bowl-shaped, and the basals are comparatively largei*. The 

 arrangement of the azygous pieces upon which DeKoninck 

 placed so much stress in defining Woodocrinus,\^^ in our opinion, 

 not different from that of Poteriocrinns or Scajyhiocrinus, only 

 more plates of the ventral sac are exjjosed to view, owing to the 

 width of the azygous side, and as we see no other distinction 

 between Woodocinnus and our Pachylocriniis, we place the 

 species which we had referred to the latter, including '' Zeacrinus^' 

 elegans and a few others of the same type, under Woodocrinus, 

 as this name has priority. Perhaps, if all American species were 

 as distinct as " Zeacrinus'''' elegans from Woodocrinus macrodac- 

 tyliis, it might be possible to make the former the t3^pe of a 

 separate group, but as we find all intermediate forms, from 

 infolding arms to spreading arms, and two to five or more bifur- 

 cations, flat, angular and rounded arms, any such separation must 

 be adaudoned. 



Fhilocriiius, De Koninck, from Punjaub, India, is probably, to 

 judge from the figure, a species of 'Woodocrinus. We think it has 

 azygous plates, but these were covered by matrix in DeKoninck's 

 specimen. We also doubt if the arm plates of first and second 

 order were laterally connected by suture ; these evidently' were 

 free as in the Fistulata generally. 



Revised Diagnosis. — Calyx sometimes obconical, more fre- 

 quently depressed-bowl-shaped, and the underbasals bent inward, 

 forming a concavity. Basals large, constituting a continuous 

 ring beneath the radials. Azygous plates arranged as in Poterio- 

 crinus ; ventral sac slightly inflated. Brachials composed of one 

 or two pieces, which jointly have the form and size of the radials ; 

 they are wider than long, and their lateral margins are fitted 

 closely together as if they were united by suture. This infolding 

 of the brachials extends also to the arm plates up to tlie second 

 bifurcation; and is often found throughout the full length of the 

 arms. The arm joints are short, quadrangular, rarely cuneate. 




166 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



the apposed faces, more or less parallel and flat, angular or 

 rounded on their outer face. The arms dichotomize and each 

 branch gives off one or more branches to the inner side of the 

 ray, which either bifurcate again or remain simple. The articu- 

 lation is the same as in Scaphiocrinus. Column circular, or 

 obtusely pentangular. 



The zoological position of Woodocrinus is probably between 

 Scaphiocrinus and Zeacrinus. 



Geological Position, etc. — The genus occurs only in the Subcar- 

 boniferous, and almost exclusively in the lower portions. 



We place under Woodocrinus the following species, all of which 

 were referred by us, Rev. i, p. 116, to Pachylocrinus : Zeacrinus 

 arboreus Worthen, Zeacrinus asper M. and W., Zeacrinus concin-

ZEACRINUS (Troost MS.) Hall, Kev., i, p. 125. 



Revised W. and Sp. (PI. 6, fig. 9, and PI. 9, fig. 3). 



Zeacrinus differs from Woodocrinus (Pachylocrinusi) in the 

 form of the ventral sac, which, as described by us, is p^^ramidal, 

 sharply angular and pointed at the upper end ; while that of 

 Woodocrinus is club-shaped, inflated above. The two genera 

 differ also in the construction and form of the dorsal cup, which 

 in Zeacrinus is much more depressed and disk-like. Basals 

 exceedingly small, trigonal, deeply notched for the reception of 

 the radials. The underbasals at the inner floor of the calyx are 

 generally larger than they appear at the outer side, and the 

 angles of the radials sometimes touch the underbasals. Plates 

 of the cal3^x massive, especially the radials, their distal faces 

 sloping outward ; articular facets with muscular extensions. 

 Arm plates generally flat, except the axillaries, which frequently 

 are tuberculous. The arms dichotomize toward the inner side of 

 the ray from each main division, the branches rarely dividing 

 again. The arm joints are short, transversely arranged, those of 

 the same rank slightly increasing in width upwards, those of the 

 next order narrower by one-half than the preceding bifurcating 

 plate. By this structure, the arms of each ray, and of the main 

 divisions of the ra3^s, form laterall}^ a straight line, by means of 

 which they fit in so closely against the arms of adjoining rays, 

 that the}^ often appear as if united by suture. Column round, 

 comparatively small. 



We now recognize under Zeac7'inus only the following species, 

 viz. : Zeacrinus bifurcatus, Z. compactilis Worthen ; Z. magnolia- 

 formis 0. and N.; ^. ovalis Lyon and Cass.; Z. Wortheni Hall, 

 and our new species Z. nodosus, all other species which were re- 

 ferred b}^ us to this genus are found now under Woodocrinus. 



Zeacrinus nodosus, nov. sp. (PL 6, fig. ;>). 



The largest known species of the genus. All plates of calyx 

 and arms nodose, except basals and underbasals; the nodes on 

 all axillaries, and the first plate of each succeeding order of arm 

 plates, almost covering the entire surface of the plate ; while at 

 the intermediate plates the nodes have more the shape of small 

 tubercles, arranged so as to occupy an excentric position, leaning 

 slightly toward the wider or pinnule-bearing side, thereby forming 

 along the arms two rows of nodes, alternately arranged. 



Underbasals of medium size, extending beyond the column, 




168 PROCEEDINGS OF TBtE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



forming a shallow inverted cup, decagonal at the outer side. 

 Basals trigonal, very minute, irregular in size, the two anterior 

 ones smaller than the others. Radials large ; broadly truncate 

 below ; subquadrangular in outline but hexagonal ; the three 

 lower faces scarcely as wide as the lateral ones, and narrower by 

 one-half than the upper side. Brachials 1X5; four of them tri- 

 angular, giving off two arms each ; the anterior one quadi-angular, 

 with only one primary arm. The arms bifurcate on the fifth 

 plate, and again on the tenth to fifteenth ; the higher divisions 

 are not known. In this species, exceptionally, the inner arms 

 branch again. 



Azj'gous plate elongate, resting upon the underbasals ; the 

 right lateral face, which is slightly convex, abutting against the 

 right posterior radial, its upper side supporting the anal plate ; 

 leaning with its left lateral side against the other radial, and with 

 its lower sloping side against the adjoining basal.

We have heretofore made Coeliocrinus a subgenus of Hydreio- 

 nocrinus, owing to slight variations in the form and construction 

 of the ventral sac, which we thought to be the only distinctive 

 character. Beautiful specimens, however, which we obtained since 

 in Kentuck}', show that the two forms differ in their mode of ar- 

 ticulation in a similar manner as Woodocrinus and ZeacrinuH, 

 Scytalocrinus and Uupachy acinus, which we ranked as full genera. 

 In Coeliocrinus the calyx is conical, in Hydreionocrinus depressed 

 — saucer-shaped . 



Coeliocrinus is found also in Europe. Phillips, in his work on 

 the Palseoz. Foss. of Cornwall, gives on PI. 59 a good figure of 

 what we take to be the balloon-shaped ventral sac of this genus. 

 His figure was copied from the Geo!. Trans, (new ser.), vol. iii, 

 PL 20, which had been published with a note by Mr. Broderip, 

 " calling attention to some analogy between this fossil and 

 Ghelyosoma macleayanum, a species of tunicate Mollusca, which 

 has a few coriaceous plates on the upper surface only." Phillips, 

 and apparently Austin, took it to be allied to Echinospherites of 

 Wahlenberg, and called it provisionally Siohseronites tessellafus, 

 which we propose to change into Coeliocrinus tessellatus.

In its arm structure Cceliocrinus leans decidedly toward Woodo- 

 crijius, but ai^proaclies Hydreionocrinus in the form of its sac- 

 like appendage.

HYDEEIONOCRINUS De Kon., Rev. I, p. 123. 



Wetherby, in a paper on the Crinoids of Pulaski Co., Ken- 

 tucky, figured and described a new species of Hydreionocrinus^ 

 which he referred with doubt to Hydreionocrinus (Zeacrinus) 

 armiger (M. and W.). Several fine specimens of this form, which 

 we obtained lately at Sloan's Valley, Ky., show it to be specifically 

 distinct from either H. armiger or H. depressus of the same 

 locality. We propose for it the name Hydreionocrinus Wether- 

 byi, in honor of the discoverer of this interesting locality. The 

 species, which was figured Journ. Cincin, Soc. Nat. Hist., vol. iii, 

 figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, diflers from H. depressus, with, which it has prob- 

 ably the closest affinities, in the less depressed form of the dorsal 

 cup, and in the basal concavity, which is shallow and almost re- 

 stricted to the underbasals ; while in the other the cup is deeply 

 excavated, and the concavity includes even a portion of the 

 radials. In our species, every brachial bifurcates, in the other 

 only four ; the anterior radial which is quadrangular, supporting 

 a single primary arm. In the former all five radials are spinifer- 

 ous, in the latter only four, and the spines are shorter and sharper. 

 In H. depressus the primary arms branch four times, in H. 

 Wetherbyi only twice, and the arms, which in the former taper to 

 a small point, remain comparatively heavy in the latter. Again, 

 in H depressus the arm joints, from the second bifurcation up- 

 wards, are biserial, while in H. Wetherbyi they do not pass the 

 interlocking stage. In the former the ventral sac is armed with 

 ten spines which join along the centre, the latter has five only, 

 and these enclose a variable number of small plates. 



Hydreionocrinus (?) orbicularis De Koninck will be found 



under Cromyocrinus.

Placing Cromyocrinus as a synon3'm under Eupachycrinus, we 

 found it impossible to uphold the genus upon any of the charac- 

 ters that had been pointed out by Trautschold. Wetherby has 

 asserted (Journ. Cincin. Soc Nat. Hist., iii, p. 8), that the genus 

 was " well fitted to embrace all those species having three or more 

 anals, a body composed of comparatively heavy, convex plates, 

 and ten arms composed of a single row of joints." He further 

 proposed to refer to Eupachycrinus all those species of this 

 group having one or more anals, heavy rounded calyx plates, ten 

 to fourteen arms, and these composed of a double series of inter- 

 locking plates. The biserial arm structure, which is only a higher 

 form of the uniserial one, is as closely intermingled with the latter 

 in the Russian form as in the typical Eupachycrinus^ and also 

 the plates of the calyx are heavy and convex in both groups. 

 The only distinction of Wetherby upon which perhaps a separa- 

 tion of the species referred by us to Eupachycrinus might be 

 established, is the number of azygous plates. We can separate 

 the species with a single plate from those with three pieces, as 

 proposed by White. A division of this kind, however, does not 

 in the least affect (7ro7?z?/ocrinMs, which, like the typical Eupachy- 

 crinus^ has three azygous plates. But Cromyocrinus differs from 

 the typical form of Eupachycrinus^ in the form of the calyx, the 

 relative size of the various plates, and in their mode of union. 

 In all American species of Eupachycrinus^ the form is de- 

 pressed, more or less saucer-shaped, and the underbasals, which 

 are very small and totally covered by the column, rest within a 

 deep concavity together with the lower portions of the basals. 

 The latter plates, and also the radials, are comparatively large, 

 the underbasals small. In Cromyocrinus the calyx is globular, 

 constricted at the upper end, the underbasals large, extending 

 conspicuously beyond the column and forming a shallow cup. 




1886.] NATURAL SCrENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



The basals are so extremely large, the radials so comparatively 

 small, that the former, together with the underbasals, frequently 

 constitute over three-fourths of the cup, while in Eupachycrinus 

 the same parts occupy not more than half that space. Besides, 

 the plates of Cromyocrinus are united by syzygy, and not by 

 ligamentous fossa, as in most species of Eupachycrinus. 



Our attention was directed to these facts by a species figured 

 and described by De Koninck under the name of Eydreionocri- 

 nus (?) globularis, which in a somewhat higher degree has all the 

 characters of Cromyocrinus, and at the same time resembles cer- 

 tain forms described under Agassizocrinus. 



To Agassizocrinus have been referred two very distinct groups, 

 the one almost always without column or even columnar attach- 

 ment, with a large almost solid, subglobular or semiovoid under- 

 basal cup, nearly truncate upper side, and small basals. The 

 other, always attached to a column, with comparatively small 

 underbasals, stretched out horizontally so as to form a five-rayed 

 star, and with extremely large basals partly on the same plane 

 with the underbasals. The latter species, which include Agassizo- 

 crinus globosus and Agassizocrinus papillatus, both described by 

 Worthen, agree most closely with Hydreionocrinus (?) globularis 

 De Koninck; Poteriocrinus nuciformis McCoy ; Gyathocrinus (?) 

 sang amonen sis M. and W., all previously referred by us to Eupa- 

 chycrinus, and all agree equally well with Cromyocrinus simplex 

 from Russia. These species, we think, might be arranged under 

 Cromyocrinus, and the only thing which prevented us from doing 

 so before, is the similarity with Trautschold's two other species 

 {Cromyocrinus geminatus and C. orna^us), which in their arm 

 structure and general form approach Epachycrinus ; while they 

 agree in other points with Cromyocrinus simplex. 



Cromyocrinus is closely allied to Agassizocrinus, to which it 

 holds a similar position as Pentacrinus to Antedon. We doubt 

 if Cromyocrinus ever became detached from its column, while all 

 species of Agassizocrinus lose their column comparatively early. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup globular, constricted above ; 

 composed of heavy plates ; sometimes (perhaps always) united 

 by syzygy. 



Underbasals comparatively large, plainly visible beyond the 

 column, horizontally arranged and forming a sharply delineated 

 star, or sometimes a very shallow cup with a slight depression for

the attachment of the column ; suture lines well defined. Basals 

 large ; generally as high or higher than wide ; three of them equal, 

 hexagonal ; the two adjoining the azygous side heptagonal, larger 

 and of a different form. 



Radials all pentagonal ; the lateral faces often so short as to 

 give to the plates a trigonal outline ; their outer faces abruptly 

 depressed or rounded off toward the brachials ; upper side straight, 

 facing upward ; articular ridge well developed and occupying the 

 full width of the plate. The right posterior radial narrower than 

 the others, its lower left side disturbed by the azygous piece. The 

 azygous plate is very large, placed in a sloping position, its two 

 lower sides resting between two basals, its left side against the 

 adjoining radial. The small truncate upper side supports the first 

 plate of the ventral sac, the right side faces the anal plate, which 

 is always considerably smaller, and extends beyond the limits of 

 the radials. Brachials one or two ; short ; laterally touching their 

 fellows of adjoining rays. Arms 5 to 10 or more ; heavy, composed 

 of short quadrangular joints, which change into cuneate pieces 

 and in some species interlock. Arm furrows wide ; pinnules 

 strong. Articulation between radials and brachials and between 

 the lower arm joints by transverse ridges and fossae. 



Ventral sac imperfectly known, but evidently short. Column 

 small, circular ; axial canal minute. 



Geological Position, etc. — Gromyocrinus is found in the upper 

 portion of the Subcarboniferous of Prussia, England, Scotland, 

 Belgium, and of the United States.

Accepting the genus Gromyocrinus, we have to consider only 

 those species in which the cup is depressed or saucer-shaped, with 

 small underbasals hidden from view and placed at the end of the 

 basal concavity. These species, however, are divisible again into 

 two groups : a, species with three azygous plates within the dorsal 

 cup, i. e., the typical form of Eupachycrinus^ and : b, species with 

 a small anal plate, partly extending into the equatorial regions, 

 for which White proposed the genus Geriocrinus. Accepting 

 also this division (see Geriocrinus), a.nd admitting into Eupachy- 

 crinus such species as " Gromyocrinus " gracilis Wetherby, which 

 has but five arms, and Eupachycrinus spartarius, Miller, with 

 fourteen arms, we must modify our former generic formula so as 

 to admit species with five to fifteen arms in place of ten, as we 

 had previously given it. Thus restricted, Eupachycrinus is a 

 strictly American genus, embracing only the following species : 



Eupachycrinus Bassetti Worthen, E. Boydii, E. crassus, Meek 

 and Worthen, ^. /brmosus Worthen, E. orbicularis (Hall), E. 

 quatuor-decim-brachiatus (Lyon), E. subtumidus Worthen, E. 

 tuberculatus M. and W., and E. verrucosus White, all previously 

 reported, and perhaps also E. platybasilis White, which is very 

 imperfectly known, and may be a Zeacrinus.

(Diagram, PI. 6, fig. 5). 



This genus was originally proposed for a single specimen from 

 the Subcarboniferous of Australia. According to McCoy, it 

 differs from Gyathocrinus and allied genera by having only three 

 arms. The cup is described as cupuliform, large, composed of 

 three plates in the proximal ring, 5 plates in the succeeding one, 

 followed by 1 X 3 radials, 3 interradials, and one or two anal 

 plates. A similar explanation of the plates has been given lately 

 by Mr. Ratte, who described another species in which " the second 

 radials," the brachials according to our terminology, were pre- 

 served. Mr. Ratte had the kindness to send us an excellent cast 

 of the type specimen, examination of which leads us to infer that 

 the third ring of plates in the calyx was composed of seven 

 pieces, of which five were radials, the two others azygous plates, 

 but that none of them are interradials. In three of the radials, 

 the articulating faces form a straight horizontal line, and only 

 these plates are apposed by regular brachials, the two others, 

 those of the two antero-lateral rays being angular and higher at 

 their distal ends. The general outline of the two last mentioned 

 plates, Indicates that they are compound plates, each representing 

 a radial and a bifurcating brachial, which probably became 

 anchylosed. They evidently supported two arms, one at each 

 side ; while the three radials with articulated brachials apparently 

 bear but a single arm like Gromyocrinus simplex Trautchold. 

 Ratte observed in Trihachiocrinus corrugatus along the ventral 

 surface between the brachials, " the casts of very small plates, 

 irregular in shape, which doubtless belong to the so-called voute 

 (vault), or outer part covering the calyx as in Rhodocrinus, for 

 instance." We seriously doubt if these plates, which he figures 

 on PI. 68, fig. 2, are any such thing as vault plates ; we believe if 

 they are plates at all, that they formed a part of the disk, and as 

 such were covering pieces. The radials enclose the azygous plate 

 proper and an anal piece as in most of the Poteriocrinidae, 

 Trihachiocrinus is not such an aberrant genus, as it was supposed 

 to be. It is closely allied to Gromyocrinus and Agassizocrinus, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 1Y5 



and like them has large basals, comparatively small radials, and 

 an unusually large az3'gous plate, followed by the anal piece and 

 •proximal plate of the ventral tube. It differs, however, from 

 both genera in the number of underbasals, and the peculiarities 

 in the radial regions which have been mentioned. 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup globose ; composed of 

 heavy plates. Underbasals three, comparatively large ; two of 

 them larger than the other, but not of equal size ; the smaller 

 piece placed in a vertical line with the anterior radial (PL 6, fig. 

 5). Basals five, extremely large, very irregular in form ; the 

 posterior one heptagonal and larger than any of the rest ; that to 

 the left pentagonal ; the three others hexagonal. The upper side 

 in four of the plates is angular, in the other truncate, supporting 

 the right postero-lateral radial. 



Radials five ; irregular in form and size, the postero-lateral one 

 considerably smaller than the others. The two posterior radials 

 as well as the anterior one pentangular, truncate above, and 

 they support a short subquadrangular brachial ; the two antero- 

 lateral ones hexagonal, angular above, supporting on each side an 

 arm. The line of articulation between the three former radials 

 and their respective brachials is widel}' gaping, and the mode of 

 articulation similar to that of all later Poteriocrinidse. The 

 brachials, although short, are twice as wide at their union with 

 the radials as along their upper ends, which are truncate, moder- 

 ately concave, each supporting a single arm. The two other 

 radials, which have angular upper faces, are slightly constricted 

 along their upper ends so as to indicate an anchylosis of 

 brachials and radials. 



Nothing is known of the ventral surface except imperfect 

 impressions of small pieces. The azygous plate is unusually 

 large, subquadrangular or trapezoidal ; placed obtusely between 

 the posterior basal and the right postero-lateral radial ; its upper 

 angle, which extends almost to the top of the radials, is slightly 

 truncated and supports the ventral tube, its left upper side abuts 

 against a large subquadrangular anal plate. Column apparently 

 small and circular.

 GRAPHIOCRINUS De Koninck, Rev. i, p. 121. 



GrapMocrinus has a bilateral symmetry, and is in some 

 respects higher developed than the preceding genera, owing to 

 the absence of the azygous piece. It has only an anal plate, and 

 this is small and placed between the radials, resting upon the 

 truncate upper side of the posterior basal. The ventral sac is 

 cylindrical, and in GrapMocrinus rudis composed of longitudinal 

 rows of subquadrangular pieces. We have not been able to 

 examine the tube in other species, and hence are not aware 

 whether the arrangement of these plates is of generic value. The 

 species heretofore referred to GrapMocrinus have but a single 

 brachial and ten arms ; we have, however, in our collection an 

 undescribed species with only five arms. 



No additional species have been described. 



BURSACRINUS M. and W., Rev. i, p. 123. 

 Syn. Synyplioerinus Trautschold, Bull., 1880. 



In a paper " TJeber Synyphocrinus^'''' Trautschold described a 

 new species from Moscow, for which he proposes the above 

 generic designation. He asserts that it differs from PoleiHocrinus 

 and allied genera in having " pentagonal, roof-like second radials, 

 and these provided along the ventral side with two thorn-like 

 processes, separated b}^ the tentacle furrow ; " that the third 

 radials had similar processes and re-entering angles, overlying 

 and covering the roof of the preceding plate; that the upper 

 truncate side supported two bifurcating plates ; that the species 

 had no pinnules, and that the vault rested upon the thorn-like 

 extensions of the third radials. We think Trautschold misunder- 

 stood his specimen. From his own figures and descriptions it is 

 evident that the calyx, as in other Fistulata, contained a single 

 radial, and that all succeeding plates were free, and true arm plates. 

 His " second radial " is grooved for the reception of the " tentacle 

 furrow," and, as shown by its form, a regular bifurcating plate, 

 his remarkable " third radial " represents the two proximal arm 

 plates, placed aside of each other, given ofi" from the plate below. 

 That pinnules were present in this species is shown even by the 

 figure in which their faces are plainly represented. The processes 

 at the inner side have no generic value, they are in connection 

 with the articular faces of the plates, and are found, more or less, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17t 



in all later Poteriocrinidse. Prof. Trautschold overlooked the 

 only important distinction between his form and Poteriocrinus. 

 His species has a single anal plate within the dorsal cup, while 

 Poteriocrinus has three. However, in this character Symjpho- 

 crinus resembles Graphiocrinus, and especially the subgenus 

 Bursac7-inus, which has the same general form, a similar funnel- 

 shaped underbasal cup, and also branching arms. 



It is possible that Poteriocrinus meekianus Shum. (Swallow's 

 Geol. Rep. Missouri) is a Bursacrinus, but it may be a Barycri- 

 nus. Only the dorsal cup is known.

Ceriocrinus is very interesting as representing a link between 

 the unsymmetrical Eupachycriniis and the symmetrical Erisocri- 

 nus. The three are very similar, and some of the species cannot 

 be separated even specifically, unless the azygous side is exposed. 

 We were at first inclined to follow Meek and Worthen in placing 

 species with one and three anal (azygous) plates under Eupachy- 

 crinus, which has three in its typical form, and to separate those 

 only which have no azygous plates within the dorsal cup. Our 

 way of disposing of this question was contrary to the rules laid 

 down by ourselves among other groups, but we took it to be a case 

 of rapid and extravagant development, and as such possibly only 

 of specific value. A similar view, but in a somewhat different 

 direction, was taken by Dr. White, who placed in his Ceriocrinus 

 species having an " anal plate " between the radials (none below), 

 together with species in which a similar plate is supported by the 

 radials (beyond the limits of the dorsal cup), and he ranked 

 Ceriocrinus as a subgenus of Erisocrinus. 



^ Koenig's genus has not been accepted (see De Loriol, Monogr. des 

 Crin. Foss. de la Suisse, 1877, p. 61). 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



We are not satisfied whether the piece resting upon the radials 

 (White's fig., 5 a) is equivalent to the one between the radials (his 

 fig., 5 c), it is at least possible that the former is the anal plate, 

 the latter a plate of the tube, or, as it is generally called, the third 

 anal plate. We, therefore, cannot agree with White in consider- 

 ing the two forms generically identical, and much less specifically. 

 If the diflference in the two specimens was to be explained by 

 individual development, that perhaps the anal piece had been 

 resorbed in the adult, the specimens should diflTer in size, which 

 is not the case. Throughout the coal-measures we find both 

 forms side by side and of nearly equal size, a certain proof that 

 the modification took place in the genus, and not in the individual. 

 We must therefore either separate the two forms generically, or 

 unite both with Eupachycrinus. 



We stated under Eupachycrinus that we separate from that 

 genus all species with a single azygous plate, and these we place 

 under Geriocrinus. Contrary to White, however, we exclude 

 those species in which that plate rests upon the radials, which we 

 place under Erisocrinus. Whether Erinocrinus and Geriocrinus 

 are full genera or only subgenera of Eupachycrinus^ or the latter 

 two of Erisocrinus, is a question which we leave open. 



Geriocrinus occupies the same relative position to Graphio- 

 crinus as Zeacrinus to Woodocrinus, and as Eupachycrinus to 

 Scytalocri7ius, their diflTerences being more of degree than of kind.

 in which no azygous plates are represented at the dorsal side, 

 but we also include those in which a plate of the ventral tube 

 rests upon the radials. In all probability was the latter piece 

 always present in this genus. The structure of the arms is the 

 same as in Encrinus and Eupachycrinus.

STEMMATOCRINITS Trautschold, Rev. i, p. 141. 



In Part I, we separated Stemmatocrinus frorxx Erisocrinus only 

 subgenerically, from the fact that it agrees with that genus in all 

 its particulars, except that the underbasals consist of a single 

 plate instead of five in the other, which we explained by anchy- 

 losis. This explanation was doubted by Carpenter, who in the 

 Chall. Rep., p. 152, says : " the plate in question appears to me 

 much more truly represented by the central pentagonal piece on 

 which the basals rest, and it is obviously what Schultze calls 

 ' eine funfseitige aus der Erweiterimg des obersten Saulen- 

 gliedes gebildete Platte.' " And again : " the analogue of the 

 development of the other cal^-x plates indicates that they (the 

 underbasals) are primitively five separate plates like their homo- 

 logues in the apical system of Ophiurids and starfishes ; and a 

 theory which would homologize them with a plate that first 

 appears as a simple ring seems to me to run counter all true 

 notions of morphology." We confess that we do not understand 

 Carpenter's argument, for we believe Sfemmatocrinus had primi- 

 tively five plates, which were united by anchylosis leaving no 

 vestige of the sutures. Similar cases of anchylosis among basals 

 and underbasals have been observed among other Palaeocrinoidea 

 and even among Neocrinoidea. In one of the two species of the 

 recent genus Bhizocrinus, the basals are distinctly divided, in the 

 other united by anchylosis. In Platycrinus it is absolutely impos- 

 sible to discover a suture between the basals, the anchylosis 

 between the plates is complete, and only in comparatively few 




180 PEOCEEDINaS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



species the place of union is still indicated by a depression. Such 

 is the case also in Dolatocrinus and Stereocrinus. In Agassizo- 

 crinus an anchylosis takes place between the underbasals, all 

 suture lines disappear in the older specimens. In Eupachycrinus 

 ornatus and Eupachycrinus gemmiformis, which occur in the 

 same bed with Stemmatocrinus cernuus, the sutures are fre- 

 quently not visible, and the plates apparently constitute a solid 

 disk which in form and proportions resembles that of Stemmato- 

 crinus. 



STEMMATOCRINUS TRAUTSCHOLDI ' nov. sp. 



(PI. 9, figs. 7 and 8.) 



Of large size. Dorsal cup subglobose ; plates heavy. Under- 

 basals of medium size, anchylosed, forming a solid pentangular 

 plate with concave sides, the latter with a somewhat waving 

 outline. The plate is slightly convex, except the columnar 

 attachment which is rather deeply impressed. There are abso- 

 lutely no sutures visible either upon the dorsal aspect or upon 

 the inner floor. The centre is perforated by a minute star-shaped 

 canal, with rays directed radially. Basals about as long as wide, 

 pentagonal in outline, but really hexagonal, the two lower sides 

 having together the length of the four others ; their upper sides 

 convex. 



Radials once and a half to twice as long as wide ; concave 

 along their basi-radial suture, along their distal side slightly 

 excavated. The articular faces are directed upward and occupy 

 nearly the full width of the plates. The articulation with the 

 brachials is by a transverse ridge with a central canal and shallow 

 fossae. Brachials two, both extremelj'- short but deep. They 

 are followed by several short, cuneate pieces. The upper part of 

 the arms is not known. 



The specimens show traces of interradial plates resting against 

 the inner edges of two radials, of which the places of attachment 

 are plainly visible (PL 9, fig. 8), and detached plates were placed 

 aside of them.

Family XXIII.— ENCRINID^ Pictet. 



J. S. Miller refers the genus Encrinus, together with Penta- 

 crinus, to his Articulata, Poteriocrinus to his Semiarticulata. 

 Zittel, and after him De Loriol, to the Articulata of Miiller ; 

 while they refer the closely allied Poteriocrinus to Miiller's Tes- 

 sellata. The mode of articulation is identical in JEncrinus and 

 the later Poterioerinidae, as pointed out in our general remarks 

 on the Fistulata, and our notes on the Poteriocrinidse. A sepa- 

 ration, therefore, in the sense of either Miller or Miiller, cannot 

 be carried out practically. A ventral covering was never found 

 to be preserved in Encrinus, and as the same thing happens to 

 be a rule among all fossil Neocrinoidea, it was postulated that 

 this genus had an open perisome, and as such was a Neocrinoid. 

 However, the ventral surface is also unknown among the Poterio- 

 crinidae, which are universally regarded as Palseocrinoids. Neither 

 is the absence of azj^gous plates in the dorsal cup exclusively 

 found among Neocrinoidea — we need only allude to Codiacrinus, 

 Geriocrinus and Erisocrinus — nor the presence of two brachials 

 (three radials), which was pointed out by Carpenter a good dis- 

 tinctive character. The latter is a very common occurrence among 

 the Poteriocrinidse, among which we failed even to make it a 

 generic distinction. We are willing to admit that Encrinus con- 

 stitutes a transition form toward the Neocrinoidea, it is even 

 possible that in the adult the interradials became partly or wholly 

 resorbed, but it is otherwise so closely connected with the Poterio- 

 crinidse that we must regard it a Palseocrinoid or place also the 

 Poteriocrinidae among the Neocrinoidea. 



Pictet, and after him Dujardin and Hupe, placed Encrinus 

 under the Pycnocrinidees, which they subdivided into Encriniens 

 Apiocriniens and Pentacriniens. This division was accepted by 

 De Loriol in his work on the Swiss Crinoids, but in his later 

 monograph on the Crinoids of France he followed Zittel, who 

 made it the type of a distinct family of the Neocrinoidea. All 

 writers preceding us, with the exception of Zittel, described En- 

 crinus with 3X5 radials, although the two upper plates are 

 laterall}^ free,* and morphologically and functionally identical 

 with the brachials of the Poteriocrinidse. 



We agree with De Loriol and Zittel that Von Meyer's genus 

 Chelocrinus, which is based on species having a second bifurca-

tion in the arms, cannot be sustained. His Dadocrinus, however, 

 seems to be a good generic form, and will be treated by us. as 

 such. We separate from the Encrinidge Picard's Encrinus Bey- 

 richi, which we refer to the Belemnocrinidae. Yon Meyer's genus 

 Galathocrinus, which some writers assert to be identical with 

 Encrinus, is known only from a single imperfect specimen. '

Generic Diagnosis. — Dorsal cup regularly pentamerous ; short, 

 saucer-shaped ; composed of 5 underbasals, 5 basals and 5 radials, 

 all equal in size and form ; there being no azygous plates. 



Underbasals minute, rhomboidal, forming together a five-rayed 

 star ; entirely covered by the top stem joint. Basals small, hexa- 

 gonal, for the greater part hidden by the column. They rest with 

 their lower sides between two underbasals, are laterally united, 

 support with their sloping upper sides the radials, and form 

 jointly a pentagon with almost straight sides. The radials are 

 large, subquadrangular ; their distal sides once and a half as wide 

 as their lower or proximal sides ; they are thick, heavy, the faces 

 toward the basi-radial suture somewhat hollowed out, showing 

 shallow fossae, while their lateral faces indicate a syzygial union. 



Brachials two, the first quadrangular, the othei* pentangular ; 

 they are heavy plates with straight lateral faces by which they 

 abut against the apposed faces of adjoining plates. The upper 

 plate is axillary, supporting two arms, which either remain simple, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 183 



or of which one or both from the second plate branch again. 

 Arms massive, composed of short transverse plates, which in 

 their upward arrangement change from quadrangular pieces with 

 strictly parallel sides to cuneiform and gradually interlocking 

 plates ; some of them, however, possess a fully developed biserial 

 arm structure. The union between radials and first brachials, 

 and also between the axillaries and proximal arm plates is by 

 articulation, the apposed faces having highly developed facets 

 with transverse ridges, and a central canal and fossae. The 

 two brachials are united by syzygy, as also the two proximal arm 

 joints. 



In Encrinus, the inner floor of the dorsal cup is grooved by 

 five primary canals, which, as they pass outward, bifurcate within 

 the basals, and the ten secondary canals thus formed proceed to 

 the radials, and thence after dividing again to the arms. These 

 grooves which are by no means restricted to Encrinus or to the 

 Neocrinoidea, are, according to P. H. Carpenter (his paper on the 

 Oral and Apical system of Echinoderms, Quart. Journ. Microsc. 

 Sci. London, 1880, p. 362), passages for the fibrillar cords going 

 out from the interradial angles of the chambered organ. 



Nothing is known of the ventral surface, except in a young 

 specimen in which we thought to observe a few plates of a ventral 

 tube. The interradial plates, owing to the large size of the artic- 

 ular facets, must have been small at any time, and possibly were 

 absorbed in the adult. Column composed of circular joints with- 

 out cirrhi.

This genus has not been accepted by Beyrich, Zittel, nor De 

 Loriol. It was proposed by H. v. Meyer for a species previously 

 described by L. v. Buch under the name of Encrinus gracilis. 




1886.] NATUBAL SCIENCES OP PmLADELPinA. 185 



The latter has a turbinate calyx, underbasals (observed by Bey- 

 rich not by H. v. Me3^er), an apparently round stem; ten arms 

 which are not very closely folded, composed of cuneiform flat 

 joints, and pinnules which are alternately arranged. The totally 

 different form of the dorsal cup seems to us sufficient to warrant 

 the generic separation. L. v. Buch's tj-pical specimen came from 

 Recaoro, Italy, and was supposed by Beyrich to be identical with 

 certain fragments which had been discovered in the Trias of 

 Upper Silesia, too imperfect, however, for critical comparison. 

 From this locality a more perfect specimen was found lately by 

 Mr. II. Kunisch, who figured and described it in the Zeit- 

 schrift d. deutsch. geol. Gesellsch. Jahrg., 1883, under the title 

 " Ueber den ausgewachsenen Zustand von Encrinus gracilis 

 Buch." We cannot altogether agree with Mr. Kunisch in his 

 views. The Silesian species is, in our opinion, essentially differ- 

 ent from the Italian one. The column is pentagonal in place of 

 circular; the arms rounded, angular at the outer face, and the 

 pinnules are given off alternately from Qvevy second joint, every 

 other one being united by syzygy ; contrary to the typical species, 

 which has flat arms, cuneiform joints, and of which every joint is 

 pinnule-bearing. The distinctions are so obvious that a specific 

 separation is necessary, and we propose for the Silurian species 

 the name Dadocrinus Kunischi. To explain the diversity in the 

 arm-structure by individual growth is at variance with the obser- 

 vations made upon recent as well as fossil Crinoids. We agree 

 that the arms undergo important modifications in their growth, 

 but we do not find cuneate arm joints turning into quadrangular 

 ones, though frequently the opposite is the case ; nor that single 

 joints are undergoing segmentations and are uniting again by 

 syzygy. The angles of the column in Dadocrinus Kunischi are 

 directed interradially, thus proving theoretically the base to be 

 dicyclic, which could not be ascertained from the specimen. 



We propose the following : — 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Form of dorsal cup obconical. 

 TJndprbasals small, covered by the column ; basals forming an 

 elongate hexagonal cup. Radials comparatively smaller than in 

 Encrinus^ but yet twice as large as the basals. Brachials in 

 number, form and articulation as in Encrinus. Arms long, uni- 

 serial, composed of single or compound joints, the latter united

Family XXIV.— ASTYLOCRINID.SI Roemer. 

 The AstylocrinidiB embrace only the genus Agassizocrinus, which 

 Pictet referred to the Comatulidae, Zittel to the Poteriocrinidae. 

 Roemer included in this family Marsupites. We place here pro- 

 visionally the genus Edriocrinus, whicli, however, in all proba- 

 bility, forms a family by itself, being sessile in early life, and 

 having no underbasals.

The name Agassizocrinus appears in Troost's List of the Cri- 

 noids of Tennessee, but the genus was not defined until 1853, 

 when Shumard, in Marcy's Report on the Red River Expedition, 

 published Troost's MS. of Agassizocrinus dactyliformis, which he 

 accompanied with a short generic description of his own. Ai^ty- 

 locrinuswas proposed by Roemer as late as 1855, when he described 

 under the name Astylocrinua laevis, a nearly perfect specimen from 

 a plaster cast, sent to him by Shumard's brother with Troost's 

 name Agassizocrinus daclyliformis attached. There cannot be 

 the least doubt as to the priority of Agassizocrmus^ but it is 

 probable that Roemer's specimen, which was Troost's type, is 

 specifically distinct from the one figured by Shumard under 

 Troost's name, and hence we recognize Roemer's specific name. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



Detached plates of Agassizocrinus are found in great abundance 

 throughout the Kaskaskia group, but perfect calices are extremely 

 rare. The cause of this is perhaps explained by the mode in 

 which the different plates are united with one another. Only the 

 underbasals seem to have been united fey common suture, and 

 these, as a rule, are the onl}^ plates which are not found discon- 

 nected in the fossil. The apposed faces of the succeeding plates 

 are vertically and horizontally provided with rather conspicuous 

 ramifying furrows, which enter the surface of the plates (PI. 5, 

 fig. 17). The ramifications vary somewhat, even among corres- 

 ponding plates, but those of apposed faces correspond with each 

 other, and together form small tunnels, which branch once or 

 twice, growing narrower at their outer ends. Between basals and 

 underbasals there are generally three of these furrows to each 

 plate ; but they unite to one on entering the underbasal cavity, 

 where they seem to communicate with certain pits or openings, 

 which have been overlooked by previous writers. 



The underbasals form an almost solid disk, with a shallow, cup- 

 shaped inner cavity. The latter contains six deep pits or cham- 

 bers, closed at the bottom, a central one surrounded by five others. 

 These pits either contained the lower part of the chambered 

 organ, or they indicate where the vessels extended down from 

 the chambers into the larval stem. It is possible that the axial 

 canals which descend from the body cavity were lodged in these 

 chambers, together with the vessels of the latter, and this might 

 explain the apparent communication of the pits with the radiat- 

 ing furrows above mentioned. But it may be possible, also, that 

 the furrows lodged groups of ligamentous fibres, by which the 

 union of the plates was rendered firmer and closer than it would 

 be when onl}^ two smooth surfaces were apposed. The plates, 

 however, as a general rule, are found to be disconnected, and the 

 radials at their lateral faces possess fossae, thus proving there 

 existed a certain degree of mobility between the calyx plates 

 generally. Similar ramifying furrows were discovered by us in 

 the genus Barycrinus between the apposed articular facets of 

 radials and brachials, plates which evidently were not united by 

 a close suture. 



Agassizocrinus in the earlier stages was attached by a column, 

 but led a free life later on, when the scar to which the stem had 

 been attached was gradually obliterated, so as to leave no traces 

 behind. The secretion of calcareous matter extended over the 




188 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



greater part of tlie underbasal disk, whieb became more elongate, 

 until at last the suture lines between the plates disappeared en- 

 tirely, although in the young Crinoid these are well marked. 

 Owing to the very considerable changes of form, which occur in 

 the growing animal, it js extremely difficult to identify the species 

 of this genus, and we fear that several of those described repre- 

 sent merely different stages of the same species. 



Agassizocrinus globosus and A. papillatus Worthen have been 

 referred by us to Cromyocrinus ; his A. hemisphericus, in which 

 the underbasals do not extend be3'ond the column, is either 

 Eupachycrinus or Scytaloc7'inus, probably the latter. 



Generic Diagnosis. — Form of calyx elongate, composed of mas- 

 sive plates, and containing a comparatively small visceral cavity. 



Underbasals extremely large ; obconical ; almost solid ; witli a 

 very small inner cavity. Young specimens have an articular scar 

 for the attachment of a column, pierced by an axial canal ; this, 

 however, becomes obliterated soon after the Crinoid enters free 

 life. The inner cavity lodges the chambered organ, and is pro- 

 vided with six deep pits, a central one surrounded by five others, 

 which either constitute the chambers of this organ or their lower 

 extensions. 



Basals large, thi*ee of them hexagonal, two heptagonal, but they 

 appear to be pentagonal and hexagonal, owing to the convex form 

 of the two lower sides. The heptagonal plates enclose, and partly 

 support, the azygous pieces, consisting of the azygous plate proper, 

 which has a sloping position and is generally large, a smaller anal 

 plate, and the first plate of the ventral tube. The size and form 

 of the tube is not known, but it was evidently small, perhaps 

 similar to that of Cromyocrinus, with which Agassizocrinus agrees 

 in the arrangement of its azygous plates. 



Radials unusually small ; wider than high ; the upper face trun- 

 cate ; they are all ptjntagonal, four of them of nearly equal size, 

 the fifth one considerably smaller and of irregular form. The 

 articular facets are on a level with the outer ed^es of the plates, 

 they are somewhat extended inward, and pierced by a transverse 

 axial canal. The articulation between calyx and arms is regu- 

 larly bifacial, resembling that between the oval stem-joints of 

 Platycrinus. The brachials are single, axillary, and abut later- 

 ally against each other. The arms are long, rather stout, rounded , 

 and composed of short, cuneate pieces. Pinnules strong. 



The mode of union between the plates of the calyx is variable. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. l89 



The underbasals were united by a common suture, the lines of 

 which in the adult Crinoid are completely obliterated. The basals 

 possess, among each other, and where they meet the underbasals 

 and radials, ramifying furrows along their faces, which, together 

 with similar furrows on apposed faces, form tunneled passages, 

 probably containing ligament ; the lateral faces of the radials, 

 however, are excavated for fossae.

 Kaskaskia group of America.

Edriocrinus led a life similar to that of Agassizocrinus, being

differs from that genus, however, in having no underbasals and no 

 stem, being simply attached by the basals. In its sessile state it 

 resembles the recent genus Holopus, with which it also agrees in 

 having an undivided base. 



Generic Diagnosis, etc. — Sessile in its larval state ; free-floating 

 in the adult, being attached by the lower end of the basals. 



Basals unusually large, elongate, closely anchylosed so as to 

 show no suture lines at the outer face; internally, however, there 

 are indications that the base might have been bisected. In the 

 young animal the form of the base is irregular and linear, in the 

 adult subglobose or deeply bowl-shaped, and the scar by which 

 the animal was attached, becomes totally obliterated by heavy 

 deposits of calcareous matter. Owing to this deposit the outer 

 form of the base differs considerably from the form of the inner 

 cavity, which grows gradually narrower toward the bottom, and 

 frequently ends in a sharp point. The walls are massive at their 

 lower parts, thin at the upper edge, which shows six excavated 

 faces for the attachment of five radials and an anal plate. 



Radials comparatively small, quadrangular, articular facet but 

 slightly excavated, occupying the full width of the plates ; pro- 

 vided with a transverse articular ridge. The anal plate is in line 

 with, and has the length of the radials, but is narrower ; it sup- 

 ports a small plate, but beyond that nothing is known of the anal 

 apparatus. The structure of the ventral surface has not been 

 observed. 



The arms are broad at the base, composed of extremely short 

 transverse pieces, of which ten or more occur between the first 

 bifurcation. Nothing is known of pinnules, nor of the condition 

 of the ventral furrow. 



Geological Position, etc. — Edriocrinus occurs in the Helder- 

 berg group of America, in which portions of the basal cup are 

 rather abundant.

Family XXV.— CATILLOCRINID^ W. and Sp. 



The group of Crinoids for which we propose the name Catillo- 

 crinidfe consists only of the genera Catillocrinus and Mycocrinus, 

 which have been distinctly separated by all previous writers. 

 Catillocrinus, which was described by Meek and Worthen as 

 closely allied to Symbathocrinus, was referred by Zittel and De 

 Loriol to the Pisocrinidse, which we regard as a mere subdivision 

 of the Symbathocrinidffi. The form, when we include the arms, 

 is similarl}" cylindrical, the arms rest likewise directly upon the 

 first radials, and are composed of a single series of plates. Piso- 

 ci^inus even has irregular radials, which is so characteristic of 

 this family, but bej^ond that the two groups are quite distinct. 

 Mycocrinus, according to Schultze, forms a family by itself. He 

 took it to be a Crinoid without arms, which, in place of arms, he 

 thought had been provided along the ventral surface with numer- 

 ous ambulacral grooves. Zittel, and also De Loriol, have placed 

 3Iycocrinus among the genera which were said to be imperfectly 

 known. 



In the Catillocrinidffi, the calyx is composed of only two series 

 of plates, and these are most remarkable for their extremely irreg- 

 ular form and distribution. The radials are massive, especially 

 at the upper margins, where ihej are transversely truncated on 

 the same plane all round. The radial plates differ in form and 

 size. Those of the two antero-lateral rays, as a rule, are much 

 larger than the three others, but, while at their upper margin 

 they are from three to six times as wide as the others, all are at 

 the basi-radial suture about equal in width. The anterior, and 

 both postero-lateral rays, rarel}^ possess more than one arm each, 

 but in the two antero-lateral ones the arms are alwaj's numerous. 

 Every arm articulates directly upon the truncate upper margin 

 of the radial without the aid of axillary pieces, and remains 

 simple from the base up. The arms are in contact all around the 

 calyx, and are composed of a single series of very similar pieces. 

 They connect with the inner cavity by a peculiar groove, which 

 follows the truncate upper face of the radials. This groove con- 

 tains the ambulacral canal and food passage, and there is undei"- 

 neath, separated by a solid partition, another groove, which near 

 the inner margin penetrates the plate, and takes a distinctly down- 

 ward course toward the inner cavity, which throughout this family 

 is exceedingly small. 




192 tROCEEDINQS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



The ventral surface has not been observed, but there is suf- 

 ficient evidence to prove that it was similar to that of the other 

 Pistulata. 



Catillocrinus has its closest affinities with Galceocrinus. The 

 radials of the three anterior rays agree in form and distribution 

 so closel^r with the radials of Galceocrinus^ that we thought at 

 ftrst that it also possessed but three rays, and that the two irreg- 

 ular plates toward the posterior side were anals and not radials. 

 This interpretation had to be given up when we found both these 

 plates to be arm-bearing. In Calceocrinus the postero-lateral 

 rays are entirely absent or transformed into anal plates ; while in 

 Catillocrinus those rays are represented in a rudimentary form. 



The Catillocrinidge are meagre in forms and belong to the rarest 

 Crinoids. They are restricted, so far as known, to the Devonian 

 of Europe and to the Subcarboniferous of America.

Troost published the name Catillocrinus in his List of the 

 Crinoids of Tennessee, without generic diagnosis. The first de- 

 scription was given in 1866, by Shumard, in a foot-note to his 

 Catalogue of the Palaeozoic Fossils of North America, from 

 specimens of Catillocrinus Tennesseae. He described the calyx 

 as composed of three series of plates : the " basals " which were 

 said to be covered by the column, and the " primary " and 

 "secondary radials." 



Through the kindness of the late Dr. James Knapp of Louisville 

 we have had an opportunity to examine several well preserved 

 calices of the above species, and can state positively that it has but 

 two series of plates. It seems that Shumard took the proximal 

 joint of the column, which is generallj^ attached, for basal plates, 

 and the edges of the basal disk proper for "primary," the true 

 radials for " secondary " radials. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 193 



Of Catillocrinus Wachsmuthi no descriptions were given of the 

 plates in the calyx, but the arm structure of the genus was here 

 for the first time described. Meek and Worthen, who had not 

 seen Shumard's description of Catillocrinus, and being unac- 

 quainted with the arrangement of plates, referred their species at 

 first to SymbathocjHnus, not, however, to the typical form, but to a 

 new subgenus, for which they proposed the name Nemalocrinus. 

 On a republication of the species, in vol. iii, of the Geological 

 Report of Illinois, the above name was abandoned, and the species 

 placed under Catillocrinus. 



In Catillocrinus Bradleyi, Meek and Worthen undertook to 

 describe also the plates of the calyx, but without applying to 

 them their proper terms. They simply designated tbem as plates 

 of a first and of a second series, except a few plates in the second 

 series which they introduced as " anals (?)." Of the five plates in 

 this series, three are easily recognized as radials, but also the two 

 others, although much smaller and very irregular in form, are 

 radials, as both are arm- bearing. 



The one toward the right supports at one end an arm, at the 

 other an elongate narrow anal plate, which abuts against the sides 

 of the proximal arm joints, and has nearly their form, being only 

 somewhat larger. Bigsby (Tliesaurus Devonico-Carboniferus, p. 

 224) places Catillocrinus as a synonym of Calceocrinus. 



We propose the following : — 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — General form, when the arms are 

 folded, elongate-cylindrical. Calyx in form of a shallow basin or 

 cup, concave at the bottom, uniformly truncate at the upper 

 margin. It is composed of two series of plates ; the upper one 

 supporting the arms, which are very numerous. Test exceedingly 

 thin along the basals, thickening rapidly upwards. 



The basal disk is apparently undivided ; the greater part hidden 

 by the column. It is irregularly pentagonal, three of its sides 

 being nearly equal, the other two, which are adjoining, equal to 

 one-half the larger ones. The side opposite the two smaller sides 

 extends considerably beyond the column, while at the other side 

 the basal disk is either altogether invisible, or reduced to a very 

 narrow band. This want of regularity has been observed in all 

 specimens, and seems to be characteristic of the genus. 



Radials five, very irregular in form, those of the antero-lateral 

 rays much larger than the rest. The two larger plates, whose 




194 Proceedings of the academy op [1886. 



upper margins constitute fully three-fourths of the periphery at 

 the top of the radials, occupy together less than one-half of the 

 circumference of the basal cup. This disproportion is caused hy 

 the peculiar form of the other radials, which, notwithstanding the 

 great spreading of the calyx, diminish in width upwards. The 

 anterior radial is much smaller, heart-shaped, with strongly con- 

 vex lateral edges, which converge almost to a point at the top of 

 the calj^x. The basi-radial suture is somewhat concave, and fully 

 as wide as that of the larger plates. The two postero-lateral 

 radials together are very little larger than the anterior one ; that 

 toward the right is smaller, very narrow, wider at the bottom 

 than at the top, and triangular when the sides are straight ; but 

 when these are curved, which is more frequently the case, it is 

 somewhat lunate. The other radial is quadrangular, fully twice 

 as high as wide, and of equal width throughout. 



The articular surface of the radials is provided with conspic- 

 uous grooves and intervening ridges, the former with a depres- 

 sion near the outer margin of the plate. The grooves along the 

 surface take a tortuous or undulating course, and near their inner 

 end turn rather abruptly toward the anterior radial. The latter 

 plate has generally but one groove, which is deeper than any of 

 the others and perfectly straight, but when it has two grooves, as 

 is exceptionally the case in Catillocrinus Tejinesseee^ these unite 

 before entering the inner cavity. The two larger radials contain 

 numerous grooves — the number varying with the species — that 

 toward the right, as a rule, has more than the one on the left. The 

 former radial has been observed to have in C. Tenne^sese 27 to 31 

 grooves, in G. Wachsmidhi 16 to 20; the plate toward the right 

 in the former species has from 21 to 23, the opposite one 15 

 grooves. The two small irregular radials have, so far as observed, 

 only one groove each. 



In perfect specimens, the grooves are lined by two rows of 

 short, transverse pieces, which partly cover the groove, but leave 

 underneath a good-sized passage. The plates rest upon the ridges, 

 where they abut against their fellows from adjoining grooves. 

 With the exception of the ridges and grooves, the truncated 

 upper side of the radials forms a uniform plane, interrupted only 

 by a small elevation along the left side of the quadrangular radial. 

 This elevation is occupied by a small, elongate anal plate, which 

 abuts against the two proximal joints of adjoining arms. The 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 195 



plate is placed on a level with the arm joints, has a like width 

 and, therefore, is easil}^ mistalien for an arm plate. 



The anal plate supports a very stout appendage, composed of a 

 single row of exceedingly large and heavy plates, longitudinally 

 arranged, which, instead of forming into a tube as in the case of 

 other Fistulata, are transversely curved like arm joints, leaving 

 a rather shallow, semicircular furrow on the inner side. These 

 plates are along their back extremely heavy, as thick as the radials 

 at their upper margins, but they thin out toward their ends, 

 and approaching the furrow become extremely delicate. The 

 proportions of the plates are well shown by our figure of Catillo- 

 crinus Wachsmuthi (PL 5, fig. 16), in which five of these plates 

 occupy an inch, while in the same space there are seventeen arm 

 joints. It must be further mentioned that up to that point the 

 plates suffered no diminution in height nor in width, nor is there 

 any decrease in the thickness of the wall, which in Gatillocrinus 

 Wachsmuthi^ at the top of the fifth joint, is nearly two thirds of 

 the whole width of the appendage. The cross section is semilunu- 

 lar except at the base. The stoutness of the plates on the one 

 side, and the grooved structure on the other, are perhaps due to 

 the great thickness of the radial plates upon which the tube rests; 

 it had to be so necessarily in order to eflTect a communication with 

 the inner cavity of the calyx. The groove was probably covered 

 during life by perisomic plates. No traces either of a vault or a 

 disk have been observed. 



The arms rise directly from the truncated summits of the 

 radials, without the intervention of axillarj^ plates. There is an 

 arm to every groove, and, hence, some of the radials, contrary to 

 the rule in other Crinoids, support a large number of arms from 

 the same level. The arms are simple, slender, comparatively 

 long, scarcely rounded outwardly, of almost uniform size, and 

 when closed they appear as if united into a solid wall. The arm 

 joints are quadrangular, much longer and somewhat deeper than 

 wide, with parallel sutures. Arm furrows deep, triangular. 



The column is circular, composed of thin joints, the upper part 

 is very stout but tapers rapidl}' downward. 



Geological Position, etc.— The genus is apparently I'estricted to 

 the Upper Burlington and Keokuk divisions of the Subcarbonif- 

 erous of America.

 1879. Zittel, Handb. d. Palseoutolo^ie, vol. i, p. 380. 



Schultze supposed that Mycocrinus had no arms, but his own 

 figures and description indicate the contrary. The radials are 

 provided close to the periphery, and in front of the ambulacral 

 grooves, with well developed articular facets, pierced by trans- 

 verse slits. 



Mycocrinus resembles the last described genus very closely, but 

 differs in the bipartite basal disk, the greater symmetry and regu- 

 larity in the arrangement of the radials, and in the general form. 

 We offer the following : — 



Revised Generic Diagnosis. — Calyx in form of a mushroom, 

 constructed of two series of plates, the upper series forming the 

 thallus, the lower the stalk. The plates are massive, of very 

 irregular form, and without ornamentation. 



Basals two, large, unequal ; one of them twice as large as the 

 other. They are very heavy and form a distinct, subglobose, 

 knob-like body, slightly truncate below for the reception of the 

 column. Its upper side rises to form a low five-sided pyramid, 

 near the outer margins of which there are twelve narrow slits 

 parallel to the edges. Two of the sides have three slits each, the 

 three others two each. 



Radials five, resting with their inner edges upon the angular 

 margin of the basal disk, each plate facing one of the five sides of 

 the pyramid. They spread broadly outward from the edge of 

 the basals, and extend far beyond their outer margins. Two 

 of the radials are of equal width, much larger than the rest. 

 These two are separated from one anotlier at one side by two 

 equal, much smaller plates, at the other by a single plate some- 

 what larger than the two others. The single plate is more than 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 19t 



one-half narrower above than below, owing to an angular exten- 

 sion at the lower half of its two lateral faces, which fit closely 

 into the adjoining excavated side of the large radials. Similar 

 processes arise from the sides of the two smaller plates, but here 

 only along the suture toward the larger one, the opposite suture 

 being perfectly straight. By means of the lateral extensions, the 

 large radials, which at their basi-radial suture have nearly the 

 same width as the smaller ones, attain at their upper face three 

 times the widtjh of the other plates. 



The articular surface of the radials is truncated, unusually 

 thick, and closely resembles that of Catillocrinus. Mycocrinus 

 boletus must have had fifteen arms, for there are fifteen rather 

 shallow arabulacral grooves, which pass from near the periphery 

 of the calyx to the radial centre. There are six upon each of the 

 two large radials, and one upon each of the two smaller ones. 

 The six grooves upon the two larger radials unite into one, and 

 hence there are but five main trunks entering the inner cavity. 

 The median part of every groove has a deep linear furrow, which 

 takes a somewhat downward course, and penetrates the walls of 

 the radials. Close to the peripliery, outside of each groove, thei'e 

 is a well-marked slit-like axial canal, making fifteen in all, which 

 pierce the radials throughout their full length, and enter the upper 

 margins of the basals. These canals or tunneled passages are 

 evidently axial canals, which entered through the twelve slit-like 

 openings at the inner floor of tlie basals the chambered organ, 

 and as such communicated with the arms. 



The body cavity is very small, its width not equaling the thick- 

 ness of the radials ; its depth being less even than its width. 

 Form of the arms, construction of summit and anus unknown. 



The column seems to have been circular, with a small, round 

 central canal. The only species is : —

The only known genus of this family has been variously referred 

 to Gheirocrinus and Calceocrinus. As early as 1851, Hall, in 




198 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



the Geological Report of New York, vol. ii, p. 352, gave notice of 

 a peculiar Crinoid from the Niagara group, of which he had 

 obtained what appeared to be a bipartite base or pelvis showing 

 a columnar attachment, for which he proposed the name Calceo- 

 crinus. In 1860, in the 13th Regents Report of the New York 

 State Cabinet of Nat. Historjj the same author described under 

 Cheirocrinus six new species of American Crinoids having a base 

 similar to Calceocrinus, and which evidently belonged to that or 

 a very closely allied genus. According to Salter (Murchison's 

 Siluria of 1859), the name Gheiroc^Hnus had been used by Austin 

 in MS. for a similar form from the Wenlock limestone, but Eich- 

 wald had already in 1856 preoccupied the name for a certain type 

 of Cystidea. Shumard was the first writer to direct attention to 

 the probable identity of Galceocrinus with Hall's Cheirocrinus, 

 and in his Catalogue of the Palaeozoic Fossils of North America 

 he added the name Galceocrinus in pai-enthesis to all described 

 species of Gheirocrinus. In this he was followed in 1869 by 

 Meek and Worthen, and in 1879, Hall himself adopted Galceocri- 

 nus, while both Angelin and Zittel have retained Gheirocrinus. 

 It seems to us the latter name, according to established rules, 

 cannot be npheld for Hall's type, because it was preoccupied by 

 Eichwald for a Cystid, and even if it be true, as asserted by F. 

 Schmidt (Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersburg, Ser. ii, vol. xi, No. 11), 

 that Eichwald 's Gheirocrinus is identical with Glyptocystites, 

 which has priority, this would not alter the case. The same view 

 was evidently taken by Meek and Worthen, who proposed, in case 

 doubt should arise as to its identity with Hall's type of Galceo- 

 crinus, to change the name Gheirocrinus into Eucheirocrinus. 



We would accept the latter name, had not Hall himself, who 

 had the best opportunity to compare the type specimens, given 

 preference to Galceocrinus. Bigsby, in the Thesaurus Devonico- 

 Carboniferus, erroneously placed the genus Gatillocrinus as a 

 synonym under Galceocrinus. 



Galceocrinus was made by Meek and Worthen, in 1873, the tj-pe 

 of a distinct family, for which they introduced the name " Galceo- 

 crinidae.''^ This was adopted by De Loriol, but Angelin and 

 Zittel in their classification apply the name '"'■ Gheirocrinidse."^^ 



Galceocrinus differs in external appearances so essentially from 

 all other Crinoids, that Hall introduced for its description a spe- 

 cial terminology, which was adopted by all succeeding writers. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF THILADELPHTA. 199 



In this special names were given to parts of the calyx, which, as 

 we will presently sliow, are repi-esented in otlier genera, and hence 

 should be designated by the same name, the more since some of 

 his appellations conflict seriously with terras long ago established. 

 Hall divided the calj^x into two parts. The one, which he called 

 the " dorsal side," comprises the anterior side and not, as should 

 be expected from the name, the aboral part; the other, which he 

 designated as the " ventral side," by which are usually under- 

 stood the oral or summit portions, represents the posterior 

 side. According to Hall, the " dorsal side " consists of three — 

 perhaps sometimes five — " basals," of the " upper and lower dor- 

 sal plate " or the first and second anterior radials, and of the 

 right and left " dorso-lateral plate " or lateral radials. He further 

 discriminates between " plates of the dorsal arm," the brachials 

 of the anterior ray, and those of the " dorso-lateral arms," or arm 

 plates of the lateral rays. The " ventral " side is described as 

 being composed of the "ventral arching plate" — which actually 

 consists of two pieces, and which either are anal plates, or non- 

 arm-bearing radials — and succeeding these of a row of plates, 

 longitudinally arranged, which were designated as "plates of the 

 ventral side," but which are plates of an anal tube. There are 

 besides summit or vault pieces which, however, were not described 

 by Hall. 



The most remarkable feature of this genus is represented by 

 the basals, which are located on the posterior side of the calyx. 

 They connect with the plates of the anterior side, which is trun- 

 cated, toward the basals, not by suture as in the case of other 

 Crinoids but by muscles and ligament, thus producing between 

 basals and radials a marked articulation. There is a widely gap- 

 ing suture along the articular line, which, as Meek and Worthen 

 suggested, permitted the basals to be opened out on a line with 

 the radials and other parts of the calyx. That the cal3^x was 

 capable of bending at this point is well shown by a unique speci- 

 men of Calceocrinus tunicatus Hall, in the possession of Mr. 

 James Love of Burlington, in which the main body stands out 

 from the column at an angle of sixty degrees ; while in most of 

 the specimens which we have examined the crinoid hangs down- 

 ward, almost parallel with the column. No specimen, however, 

 shows the calyx in an erect position. 



There are in this genus but three rays, which vary considerably 




200 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADExMY OP [1886. 



in form and size. The two lateral rays are composed of a large 

 radial, which is followed by two ver3r small brachials. The an- 

 terior ra3' has two radials, which combined are smaller than the 

 single lateral ones. The two are generally separated by the lateral 

 radials which join between them, placing one of the plates at the 

 upper, the other at the lower end of the calyx. This peculiar 

 structure has evidently prevented all former writers from recog- 

 nizing those plates as radials. That the}^ are radials, and were 

 gradually separated in the course of palieontological times, is 

 proved by Hall's Silurian species Calceocrinus chrysalis and 

 Galceocrinus inaequalis Billings,^ by C. radiculus Ringueberg and 

 C. Barrandii Walcott, in all of which the plates are narrowly 

 elongate, and united by a short suture. In Galceocrinus goth- 

 landicus of Upper Silurian age, they are separated, but the first 

 radial extends almost to the second. In Galceocrinus clar us and 

 Galceocrinus Barrisi from the Devonian, the distance that sepa- 

 rates them is somewhat greater ; while in all Sub^-arboniferous 

 species the two plates stand widely apart. 



Galceocrinus agrees with Gatillocrinus in the arrangement 

 and form of its plates. In both of them the second ring consists 

 of five extremely irregular pieces, but, while in the latter all five 

 are arm-bearing, those of Galceocrinus are arm-bearing only in 

 the three anterior rays. The two posterior ones are small and sup- 

 port a large tube. The corresponding plates in Gatillocrinus 

 support upon one end of their upper side an arm, upon the other 

 a similar tube as Galceocrinus^ and in both genera the two antero- 

 lateral rays are far stronger developed than any of the others. 

 The two forms resemble each other more closely than might be 

 expected from Crinoids that differ so widely in their general 

 aspect, as shown by changing Gatillocrinus from its natural posi- 

 tion into that of a Galceocrinus. This may be done theoretically 

 by pressing the calyx sideways in such a manner that the basals 

 are pushed over to one side, and the three arm-bearing radials to 

 the opposite side. The lateral ones, however, owing to their large 

 size naturally extend to the basal side, where they join the small 

 postero-lateral radials, which, as stated, hold a similar position 



1 It was Mr. Walter R. Billings, of Ottawa, who already in 1883 directed 

 our attention to lleterocrinua inaequalis as being a Calceocrinus, and he 

 informed us also that in this species the two anterior radials were joined by 

 sutures. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



as the anal plates in Calceocrinus, resting like them against the 

 basals and supporting a similar anal tube. By thus changing 

 the respective parts into a relative position, the affinities whch 

 exist between the two genera can be better appreciated. The 

 form of the calyx, however, the articulation between the basals 

 and radials, and the sloping position of the lateral ra3-s is so 

 unique, and strikingly difl'erent from Calillocrinvs and other 

 genera, that Calceocrinus must be referred to a distinct family. 



The slight variations, which naturally occur in the brnnching 

 of the nrras, were taken by Hall, and Meek and Worthen, for 

 specific distinctions. AVe fear these differences are too trifling to 

 be regarded as such, and we have felt obliged to refer some of 

 their species to our list of synonj^ms. 



Po^yfscriptum. — While our descriptions ni:)on the Calceocrinidie 

 were in press, we received a paper from Mr. E. 0. Ulrich (extracted 

 from the 14th Ann. Rep. Geol. Surv. Minn., p. 104): Remarks 

 upon the names Cheirocrinus and Calceocrinus, with descriptions 

 of three new generic terms and one new species. The author sub- 

 divides the species heretofore known under Calceocrinua into three 

 genera : Cremacrinus, Deltacrinus and Ralysiocrinus, and applies 

 to them the family name "Cremacrinidae." There is, in our opinion, 

 no valid reason for discontinuing the names Calceocrinus and Calce- 

 ocrinidae. The genus Calceocrinus was properly defined by Hall 

 and others, and several species have- been referred to it by them. 

 Moreover, Meek and Worthen 's name Eucheirocrinus would have 

 priority, and also Calceocrinidae, as both were proposed in 1873. 

 Under Cremacrinus Ulrich placed the species in which the two 

 anterior radials (the two central plates of his) are connected ver- 

 tically ; under Deltacrinus those in which said plates are sepa- 

 rated by the two lateral radials (his two large dorso-lateral 

 pieces). This difference, we admit, exists between the Lower 

 Silurian and Subcarboniferous species, but in the Upper Silur 

 and Devonian the two forms pass gradually into one another, so as 

 to make a generic separation impracticable. Ul rich's statement 

 on p. 110, that Creviacrinus has " three primary radials," Delta- 

 crinus "five," Halysiocrinus "eleven," is based altogether upon 

 incorrect observation. All these species have but three arm- 

 bearing radials — one of them compound— and the plates which 

 Ulrich regarded as "eleven primary radials," are axillary bra- 

 chials of ascending orders. — (May, 1886).

In general form the specimens resemble a wilted flower, owing 

 to the position of the eal3^x, which hangs downward along the 

 column. The calyx is laterally compressed, especially at the 

 juncture of basals and radials, where it is almost linear; while a 

 transverse section across the median part of the radials and 

 through the centre of the basal disk is decidedly triangular. 

 The anterior side forms a flat body, broadly truncate at the lower 

 end, constricted in the middle, and composed exclusively of the 

 radial plates. The basals, which are placed upon the posterior 

 side, are separated from the radials of the opposite side by a 

 widely gaping articular line, occupying the lower end of the 

 calyx. Along this line, probably, the upper part of the Crinoid 

 could be bent upwards and be brought in an erect position. The 

 posterior side is composed, in addition to the basals, of two non- 

 arm-bearing plates, which face laterally' the incurving sides of the 

 radials, and support upon their upper side an extremely large 

 ventral tube. 



The basals jointly form a kind of semicircular disk, of which 

 the straight line faces the truncated lower side of the anterior 

 radial, and the curved part rests against the infolding lateral 

 margins of the lateral radials, and against the two non-arm- 

 bearing plates. The basal disk, which is slightly convex, is com- 

 posed of three pieces, two of which are equal, the other large and 

 of a very different shape. The two former taken together are 

 lunate, and enclose within their arched sides the other plate, 

 which lies transversely, and occupies almost the entire width of 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 203 



the truncated side of the basal disk. The articular facet for the 

 attachment of the column has a lateral position, and is placed 

 within the centre of the two equal pieces, without touching at 

 any point the third plate. It is large, somewhat excavated, and 

 divided vertically by the suture line. 



The radials consist of four plates of very irregular aiTangement. 

 The two larger ones, those of the lateral rays, occupy more than 

 two-thirds of the anterior side of the calyx, and support two small 

 transverse brachials, of which the upper one is axillary. Two 

 much smaller and very irregular plates, which are generally sepa- 

 rated by the large lateral pieces, form the radial of the anterior 

 ray. The large lateral radials are bent abruptly along their outer 

 sides, so as to occupy considerable space upon the posterior side 

 of the calyx. They are hexagonal — rarely pentagonal — angular 

 at their upper and lower ends ; one of the lower sloping sides 

 abuts against the first anterior radial, the other against the basal 

 disk. The sloping upper face connects at one side with the second 

 anterior radial, the opposite side supports the first brachial plate. 

 Of the lateral faces one meets the corresponding side of the 

 opposite radial, the other an anal plate. In the anterior ray, the 

 first radial is linear, but more frequently triangular, two of its 

 sides resting within a re-entering angle formed by the lateral 

 radials. The lower edge is generally wider, and constitutes the 

 bottom part of the anterior face of the calyx, being on a level 

 with the truncated edge of the basals, and united with them by 

 muscular articulation. The articulating surface, near the outer 

 margin of the component plates, is provided with a deep fossa, 

 evidentl}' for the lodgment of elastic ligament. A similar but 

 narrower fossa is placed close to the inner margin of the plates, 

 separated from the former by a narrow transverse ridge. The 

 middle part of this ridge extends somewhat into the large fossa, 

 and forms a kind of triangular projection which contains a small 

 axial canal. The second anterior radial has nearl}' the same form 

 as the first, but its position is reversed, the truncate side being 

 directed upwards, the angle downwards, resting between the 

 sloping upper sides of the adjoining basals. In Calceocrinus 

 chrysalis, in which the first anterior radial joins the second, both 

 plates are exceptionally quadrangular, and, therefore, the first 

 lateral radials pentagonal instead of hexagonal. The plates 

 above are free. There are two brachials in each lateral ray, a 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF TUE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



single one in the anterior one. The articular line between the 

 lateral radials and brachials is widely gaping, the union between 

 the two succeeding plates apparently by syzygy. They are closely 

 fitted together in the specimens, and a suture is rarely discern- 

 ible. The lower one is short and quadrangular, the up[)er one 

 axillary. The brachial of the anterior ray is generally twice as 

 wide as high, and truncate at its upper side. 



It has been stated that in the lateral rays the first brachials 

 are placed obliquely against the radials, in consequence of which 

 these two rays lean over toward the posterior side. By this 

 peculiar structure, the outer sloping faces of the bifurcating 

 brachials are brought into a vertical, the inner ones into a hori- 

 zontal position. The vertical side supports laterally another 

 axillary, the horizontal side vertically a free arm. The former is 

 followed again by an axillary on one side, and an arm on the other, 

 and so on in the same manner to the last bilurcation, the axillary 

 plates all arranged in a nearly horizontal line, the free arms hav- 

 ino- an upright direction. In species with but few bifurcations 

 the position of the brachials is more erect. 



The arms are composed of single joints, which are generally as 

 long as wide ; rounded exteriorly and provided with a deep tri- 

 angular groove at the ventral side ; they are comparatively long, 

 rather stout at the base, but taper gradually upwards. The 

 lateral arms, after their first bifurcation, do not branch again, but 

 ffive off from every third or fourth joint a large arm-like pinnule, 

 which extends to the end of the arm. The lower pinnule is less 

 than half the size of the arm at the place of attachment ; the one 

 or two succeeding ones have nearly the same size as the arms at 

 the place of their origin. The pinnule-bearing joints appear to 

 be somewhat stouter owing to a thick callosity at their upper end, 

 and their line of articulation is directed obliquely. The interme- 

 diate joints have parallel sides, which show neither fossse nor 

 radiations, and probably were united simply by suture. The 

 anterior ray has but a single arm, which is given off" in an upright 

 direction. It is stouter than the lateral arras, and remains fre- 

 quently simple throughout, but when it branches occasionally, 

 the division takes place near the distal end. 



Anal plates two, resting against the basals and the incurved 

 wings of the lateral radials. Tiieir upper side supports a row of 

 very large and heavy quadrangular plates, which are longitudi- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PlULADELPniA. 205 



Daily arranged and form the exterior side of an enormous anal 

 tube, extending to the tips of the arms and perhaps beyond their 

 limits, with scaicely au}^ diminution in size. Like in Gaiillocrinus, 

 only the posterior side of the tube is heavily plated, the anterior 

 side being composed of ver}' small and delicate plates. 



The column is comparatively large, near the cal^-x composed 

 alternately of shorter and longer segments, which soon turn alto- 

 gether into long joints. Hall gives the column as very short ; it 

 was, however, of considerable length in some cases, as we have 

 followed it up to a foot or more without reaching the root. 



Geological Position^ etc. — Calceocrinus makes its appearance in 

 the Lower Silurian, but only in America. It struggled through 

 the Devonian, and reached its greatest distribution in the earlier 

 periods of the Subcarboniferous, but without flourishing abun- 

 dantly. Throughout this long period of time, the species change 

 but little, less than those of an}' other genus, and it is exceedingly 

 difficult to point out specific differences, which in most of them 

 are so slight that thc}^ hardly deserve the name. In Europe it 

 has been found only in the Upper Silurian.

APPENDIX. 



{January, 1886). 

 STEPHANOCKINID.ffi; W. and Spr. 



Through the kindness of Prof. R. P. Whitfield, to whom we are 

 under lasting obligations, we had lately an opportunity to examine 

 from the collection of the American Museum of Natural History 

 of New York City, some valuable and unique specimens of the 

 genus Stephanocrinus. Among these were 25 specimens of Ste- 

 phanocrinus angulatus Conrad, two of them showing the brachial 

 appendages — the so-called pinnules — and 18 specimens of Stephan- 

 ocrinus gemmiformis Hall. 



Stephanocrinus is one of those genera which prove to us how 

 inappropriate it is to make Crinoids, Cystids and Blastoids 

 distinct classes. The genus has been regarded by F. Roemer, 

 Johannes Miiller and Pictdt to be a Cystid, by Messrs. Etheridge 

 and Carpenter and S. A. Miller a Blastoid. Dujardin and Hupd 

 —and apparently (?) Hall— refer it to the Crinoids '; while Prof. 

 Zittel was in doubt whether he should place it with the Blastoids 

 or not. That it has certain affinities with either one of the three 

 groups cannot be denied. It agrees by its oral and anal pyramid 

 with certain forms of the Cystids, while in its general habitus 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 207 



and in the position of the ambulacra it agrees with the Blastoids ; 

 and yet it is, as we shall prove, unquestionably a Palseocrinoid. 



It seems Roetner ^ had discovered sockets for the reception 

 of brachial appendages, and probablj^ these sockets and the val- 

 vular covering of mouth and anus induced him to place the 

 genus with the Cj'stidea. Johannes Miiller, who also regarded it 

 a Cystid, makes the remark: '* Nierenformige Warzen am Ende 

 der Strahlen des sternfijrmigen Feldes deuten auf die Gegenwart 

 vou Armen hin." Hall, in vol. ii, p. 351 , of the New York Report, 

 does not describe the appendages which he had discovered as 

 Blastoid pinnules, but speaks of tentacula attached to the margin 

 along a slight groove in the base of the depressions between the 

 angular processes which ornament the summit of the body. 

 These tentacula or fingers consist of ten branches, each comj^osed 

 of a double series of plates above, hut uniting below a series of 

 coalescing plates which have a different arrangement. It seems 

 to us this description does not apply to ambulacral appendages, 

 nor do we think that Hall took the genus to be a Blastoid. On 

 p. 212 of the New York Report he called it a Crinoid, and in 

 1879 he placed it aside of well-known Palaeocrinoidea. Pictet 

 describes the base as composed of " five subradials," and " five 

 basals," and the mouth as surrounded by " ten tentacles." Du- 

 jardin and Hupe place it among the Haplocrinidae, between Haplo- 

 crinus and Coccocrinus, and also these writers describe within 

 the radial groove a reniform impression for the reception of an 

 arm, but thought to observe " lames paralleles " along the grooves. 

 They regard, like Roemer, the central pyramid, the mouth, and 

 the lateral aperture an ovarian opening. 



Considering that Hall, Roemer, Miiller, and Dujardin and Hupe, 

 all describe at the outer end of the ambulacral groove a reniform 

 scar for the attachment of an appendage, it is somewhat surprising 

 that Etheridge and Carpenter place the genus among the Blas- 

 toids. They undertake to explain this by Hall's discovery of 

 " ambulacral appendages .... like those of other Blastoids," 

 and give it as their opinion that the reniform scar of Roemer " is 

 nothing more than an infolded radial lip." We stated already 

 that we thought Hall never regarded Stephanocrinus a Blastoid, 



1 "We do not possess Eoemer"s description of Stephanocrinus which 

 appeared in Wiegmann's Archiv for 1850, and know it only from the quota- 

 tions of subsequent writers. 




208 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



and he certainly did not describe ambulacral appendages, but 

 branching fingers, no matter what name lie gave to the parts. 

 We are confident that the depression at the end of the ambula- 

 cral groove really does exist, and that it is occupied by a second 

 radial. 



Stephanocrinu8 not only has two radials to each ray, but 

 branching biserial arms, given off in a somewhat similar manner 

 as the arms in the Platycrinidse. The second radials are roni- 

 form, small, bifurcating, and rest within a semi-ovoid or horse- 

 shoe-shaped depression near the outer end of the ambulacral 

 groove. They are succeeded by two or more axillaries of a 

 higher order, which in the usual way give origin to ten arms to 

 each ray. That these appendages, although they are equall}^ thin 

 and short, are not pinnules, is proved by the fact that all are 

 supported by a radial plate, instead of being distributed sepa- 

 rately along the sides of an ambulacrum. It is further shown by 

 one of the New York specimens, in which in one of the rays the 

 appendages became disconnected, and were deposited en masse 

 at some little distance from the radials, without the least disturb- 

 ance in their arrangement, a case which could not have happened 

 if they were ambulacral pinnules. 



The ambulacra of Stephanocrinus are constructed very differ- 

 ently from those of the Blastoids ; they possess no side-pieces, 

 no transverse furrows, no hydrospire pores, and no sockets for 

 the reception of pinnules; they simply are covered by two rows 

 of Saumplattchen, which enclose a tubular canal containing the 

 food groove. The Saumplattchen or covering pieces of the same 

 row are so closely anchylosed to one another, longitudinally, that 

 it appears even under an ordinary magnifier, and in the most per- 

 fect specimens, as if there were but two elongate plates, one at each 

 side. As such they were represented by Hall in his diagramatic 

 figure. New York Geol. Rep., vol. ii, PI. 48, fig. 1 1, in which the 

 reniform plates at the outer end of the elongate pieces represent 

 the second radials. The figure shows excellently the plates of 

 the ventral side as they generally' appear in the specimens; there 

 is omitted, however, a suture along the so-called coronal processes, 

 which Hall, as well as Roemer, thought he observed, but which 

 were not accurately defined until 1883, by Etheridge and Carpenter 

 (Ann. and Mag. Nat Hist., April, p. 239). They found the pro- 

 cesses " divided into an outer part formed by the contiguous limbs 




1886. J NATURAL SCIENCES OP PniLADELPHIA. 209 



of two adjacent radials, and an inner portion or deltoid/ and 

 that the calyx consists of three rows of plates — the basals, radials 

 and deltoids. The canals which contain the food grooves are in 

 their usual preservation, more or less compressed, and in conse- 

 quence thereof the two series of covering pieces became separated 

 longitudinally, and appear in the specimens as if forming a deep 

 groove upon the surface following the median line. Little of this 

 groove, however, is seen in plump specimens. 



Ethcridge and Carpenter, and also Zittel, regard the two rows 

 of anchylosed covering plates as constituting a single piece, and 

 this, they think, represents the lancet plate of the Blastoids. 

 Upon this point they malie on p. 240 of their paper the following 

 statement: "The paired linear plates in the ambulacra we believe 

 to be single, and to represent the lancet plates of other Blastoids. 

 They seem to be usually much eroded and to have a strongly 

 marked median groove, which has been taken for a suture. Even 

 when these plates are preserved, the side plates of the ambulacra 

 are generallj^ missing ; but since Hall has discovered specimens 

 of S. angulatus still attaining ambulacral appendages like those 

 of other Blastoids, we see no reason to doubt the existence of 

 side plates and outer side plates. In fact, the former have been 

 described in S. pulchellus by Miller and Dyer." We doubt if 

 Etheridge and Carpenter ever saw a Steplianocrinus with either 

 side pieces or outer side pieces, or ever will see one, and if Miller 

 and Dj^er found such plates in their St. pulchellus, we assert that 

 their species is not a Stephanocrinus. Aside from the fact that 

 the " so-called lancet pieces " are compound structures, we think 

 it utterly impossible from the position which these plates occupy 

 toward the oral plates, that they could represent lancet pieces, as 

 in that case the food grooves would have to run out into the air 

 in place of entering the interior. 



In both of the New York species, the oral plates are on the 

 same level with the covering pieces; they meet with each other so 

 as to leave externally, when both plates are in position, no open- 

 ing or passage. The only communication with the inner cavity, 



^ We have substituted here deltoids for ^'orals,^' the latter term being 

 used by Etheridge and Carpeuter in their paper. When they wrote this 

 they still regarded tlie deltoids as representing the oials, a mistake which 

 Dr. P. H. Carpenter explained and corrected in his Challenger Report, 

 p. 162. 




210 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



in connection with the ambulacra, is beneath the covering plates 

 through the canals or tunnels which we have described. These 

 passages, which are closed at the bottom by the deflected lateral 

 edges of two adjoining interradials, as in the case of Cyathocrinvs, 

 grow deeper and narrower on approaching the oral plates ; while 

 toward the arms the}'' widen and divide, transmitting a branch to 

 each main division of the rays. All this goes to prove that the 

 passages are tubular canals, such as we find in the Palseocrinoi- 

 dea, and that the apparent resemblance between the ambulacra of 

 Stephanocrinus and those of the Blastoids, to a large extent, is 

 superficial. 



The oral pyramid, which is rather symmetrical in outline, 

 occupies the very centre of the ventral surface. It is composed 

 of five pieces of nearly equal size, which meet in the centre, and 

 are so closely connected by suture that the lines of union are 

 rarely seen in the specimens. A less close union seems to have 

 existed toward the interradials, for the oral plates are but seldom 

 preserved, when we find in their place a nearly circular opening. 



The radials extend to the full height of the coronal processes, 

 and resemble in their form closely the forked plates of certain 

 Blastoids ; while in Hall's figure (N. York Rep., vol. ii, PI. 48, 

 figs. 1 h and 2/) they appear like the radials of a Platycrinus. 

 Hall evidently mistook the cracks which so frequently are found 

 at the base of the interradial processes, for sutures, and supposed 

 the united limbs of two contiguous radials, formed a deltoid- 

 shaped interradial plate. 



The most interesting feature of Stephanocrinus unquestionably 

 is the quinque-partite oral pyramid, which, we think, gives us 

 valuable information regarding the undivided oral plate in other 

 groups of the Palseocrinoidea. It was suggested by us on p. 55, 

 that probably the central or oral plate of the Palseocrinoidea 

 primitively consisted of five pieces, of which the suture lines 

 gradually were obliterated by deposition of new material. In 

 support of this theory we could only refer to the parallel cases of 

 the basals and underbasals among which similar modifications took 

 place not only palaeontologically by anchylosis of one or more of 

 the plates, but also in the growing Crinoid by deposition of lime- 

 stone at the outer surface of the plates, as in the case of Edrio- 

 crinus and Agassizocrinus. We were unable at that time to point 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 2 II 



out a single Palseocrinoid in which the peristomial area, was 

 closed by five plates, and therefore regard the case of Stephano- 

 criniis of the utmost importance, not only as confirming our 

 suggestions, but as throwing light upon the orals of the Palseo- 

 crinoidea generall3\ Before, however, we discuss this question 

 any further, it will be necessar}'- to point out the relations of 

 Stephanocrinus with other Crinoids. 



Stephanocrinus, undoubtedly, is closely allied to Allagecrinus, 

 Haplocrinus and Pisocrinus, and must be placed with them among 

 the Larviformia, but, owing to marked difierences in the form and 

 arrangement of the arms, it cannot be arranged either with the 

 Haplocrinidse or Symbathocrinidse, and it will be necessar}' to 

 establish for it a separate family. Except in the arm structure, 

 the affinities seem to be particularly close with Pisocrinus, vfhich 

 has similar interradial processes, formed likewise by the extended 

 limbs of the radials ; but as we know little or nothing of the oral 

 plates and ambulacral structure in this genus, a critical comparison 

 is difficult. It differs also from Haplocrinus in the position of the 

 disk-ambulacra, which in the latter are subtegminal, in the other 

 exposed to view. This, we explain by individual growth, and 

 assert from palseontological evidence that Stephanocrinus, like 

 Gyathocrinus and other Palasocrinoidea in its younger state passed 

 through stages in which it closely resembled Allagecrinus and 

 Haplocrinus. Admitting this, it will be interesting, and in- 

 structive, to transform theoretically the lower differentiated 

 Haplocrinus, so as to conform with the conditions of the adult 

 Stephanocrinus. To this end we open out the five ventral plates 

 of Haplocrinus, so as to expose their ambulacral skeleton, and 

 push the ambulacra and the oral plate, which latter occupies the 

 central portions of this skeleton, in an outward direction, in such 

 a manner that the covering pieces fill up the clefts between the 

 interradial plates, and the oral plate the centre, increasing in size 

 as the space gradually grows larger. Nothing further is neces- 

 sary to complete the structure of Stephanocrinus but to extend 

 the sides of the interradials laterally, so as to close the ambu- 

 lacral groove from beneath. By these manipulations, in which, we 

 think, we closely imitated the natural development as it took 

 place among Palseocrinoids palcTeoutologically, we placed the two 

 genera in the same relative position, in hopes to arrive there b}- at 




^i2 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



a satisfactoi'}' conclusion as to the morphological resemblance of 

 the respective plates. 



In Stephanocrinus interradials have been admitted, and the 

 plates which do represent them correspond in our hypothetical 

 Crinoid with the plates which we opened out to receive the ambu- 

 lacra. The plates have relatively a similar position, both rest 

 against the upper edges of two adjoining radials, and both support 

 a small pyramid or disk, which in both cases not only occupies a 

 strictl}^ central position, but covers the peristomial area and closes 

 the oral pole. Now, if this is true, what makes those plates inter- 

 radials only in the one case and not also in the other, and why does 

 the central disk which they enclose represent the oral pyramid in 

 the one and something else in the other? That the central P3'ra- 

 mid is quinque-partite in Stephanocrinus, coalesced in the other, 

 is apparently the only structural difference between the two forms, 

 and simply upon this ground the former has been regarded b}'' 

 Carpenter (Chall. Rep., pp. 269 to 271) an oral pyiamid, and the 

 central plate of Haplocrinus a so-called "orocentral," something 

 totally unknown in Crinoid morphologj' and that of Echinoderms 

 generally. 



According to Carpenter the orals of Haplocrinus were repre- 

 sented by the five large ventral plates, although these, like the 

 interradials of other Palaeocrinoids, apparently cover the disk and 

 tentacular vestibule, contrary to the case of the orals and summit 

 plates generally which close only the peristomial area. If Haplo- 

 crinus did represent a permanent larval form of the Neocrinoidea 

 instead of the Palseocrinoidea, Carpenter would be justified in re- 

 garding those five plates as orals, and could assert that the plates 

 were in the growing animal, and in palreontological times carried 

 inward by perisome, as he and Etheridge suggested to have been 

 probabl}' tlie case in the growing Allagecrinus, but we cannot find 

 in the phylogen^^ of the older Crinoids the least evidence to justifj'^ 

 tliat supposition. On the contrary, everything points at the con- 

 clusion that the orals, and other summit plates, had relatively the 

 same proportions in the younger and lower forms, as in the adult 

 and higher types ; and we, therefore, regard the respective plates 

 in Haplocrinus like those of Stephanocrinus, Cyathocrinus and the 

 Blastoidea, whicli Carpenter, likewise, once regarded as orals, as 

 true interradial plates. If the plates in Haplocrinus really were 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 213 



orals, and also the homologues of the six or more proximals of the 

 Platj^crinidai and Actinocrinidse, and of the five summit plates in 

 Stephanocrinus, which all cover the peristomial area but not also 

 the tentacular vestibule and the disk, it would follow that in the 

 three latter the orals were carried inward by the caWx iuterradials 

 b}' which they are surrounded, but not only, as perhnps might be 

 the case in the Camarata, b3' their higher orders or upward growth, 

 but even by the primary interradials. It would further suggest 

 that in the earliest genera lieteocrinus, Glyptocrinua and allied 

 forms, which have no proximals, the " orals " were unrepresented 

 or resorbed. Also Nanocrinus pa7'adoxus (Echin. Eifl. Kalk., 

 PI. 12, fig. 7 i) has no proximals, the covering pieces, according 

 to our interpretation, rest directly against the central plate. 

 This, we know, is the case in two undescribed species of Talaro- 

 crinKS, which we discovered lately in Kentucky. In these species 

 the central piece is relatively larger than the combined orals of 

 Stephanocrinus, there are no proximals, and no other interradial 

 plates touching the central plate. The covering pieces occup}^ 

 here a similar position to the central plate — the coalesced orals — 

 as in Stephanocrinus to the quinquepartite oral pyramid. There 

 we have actual specimens, which in all essential points conform 

 with the hypothetical Crinoid which we constructed. 



From Carpenter's arguments (Chall. Rep., pp. 268-271) we 

 conclude that he regards the hypothetical "orocentral" a kind 

 of keystone, by which the actinal system is closed in a similar 

 manner as at the opposite pole the dorsocentral is said to close 

 the abactinal side. Unfortunately, however, this theorj^ as stated, 

 is not sustained by embryology. No such plate has ever been 

 discovered among living Crinoids, not even in their larval state, 

 before the opening of the tentacular vestibule, which is said 

 to represent the condition of Haplocrinus morphologically. 

 This difficulty Carpenter undertook to explain on p. 270 b}' stating, 

 that if such a plate appeared " it would only be in the way, and 

 have to undergo resorption to a greater or less extent." A weak 

 argument considering that orals of recent Crinoids actually 

 undergo that resorption. But, admitting it, what then became of 

 the orocentral of Stephanocriiius, Allagecrinus and Coccocrinus^ 

 and what of the central piece in the oral pyramid of certain Cys- 

 tidea ? He states further " the former (basals) are within the

ring of radials, and next to the dorsocentral ; and it seems there- 

 fore only natural to regard the six proximal interradial plates 

 surrounding the central piece (oro-ceutral) in the vault of a Palseo- 

 crinoid as representing oral plates." This argument is not quite 

 correct, in so far as the central piece is frequently surrounded not 

 onl}?^ by the proximals — his orals — but also by the radials and 

 anal plate (see PI. 7) ; contrary to the basals, which form a ring 

 by themselves. Besides, his argument is based to a large extent, 

 if not altogether, upon the h3^pothetical plate which he calls 

 "oro-central." 



Taking everything in consideration, is it not reasonable and 

 more natural to regard the five orals of the Neocrinoidea, which 

 in the larva are loosely folded together, and which in some of the 

 Cystidea and also in Stephanocrinus were united by a close suture, 

 as gradually becoming anchylosed in a group in which they were 

 permanently closed, than it is to invoke the existence of a new ele- 

 ment unknown in Echinoderm morphology, and even then have to 

 assert that six plates take the place of five ? ! But not only that, 

 we also have to admit that these so-called " orals " contain in their 

 midst anal and radial plates contrary to the case of the orals of 

 the Neocrinoidea, Stephanocrinus and the Cystidea, and contrary 

 to the basals, the abactinal representatives of the orals as Car- 

 penter admits. 



As a further proof that the central piece is the representative 

 of the orals, we refer to the Cystid genus Garyocrinus, which 

 has three in place of five groups of arms, and which, according 

 to our interpretation, has no proximals. The central piece which 

 occupies the centre of figure, and which we think represents the 

 oral pyramid, is surrounded by eight plates, by Jive (not four) 

 large ones, and three smaller ones, the latter conforming jointly 

 to one of the other five. Three of the plates have a strictly 

 radial position, the three others, including the compound one 

 which takes the azygous side, are interradial. We doubt if 

 Carpenter will regard these six plates, wholly or partly, as the 

 representatives of our proximals — his orals — or his theory will 

 have to undergo further modifications, as he will find it diflflcult 

 to restore five primitive pieces from an assemblage of plates as 

 here exhibited.

Stephanocrmus resembles in many respects certain forms of the 

 Blastoidea, but has true brachial appendages. The calyx is sub- 

 pyramidal, or deeply cup-shaped, with five spiniform interradial 

 processes. 



The basals form a large semicircular or subturbinate cup, more 

 or less truncate at the bottom, with a trigonal distal face, which is 

 slightly excavated for the reception of a column. They consist 

 of three pieces, almost coequal as to size but not as to form, one 

 of them being quadrangular, the two others pentangular. The 

 quadrangular piece takes the position of the smaller basal in the 

 Blastoidea, to the right of the anterior radial ; contrary to other 

 Palaeocrinoidea in which it occupies the left side. In one speci- 

 men, however, exceptionally, it is placed posteriorly, supporting 

 the greater half of two postero-lateral radials. 



The first radials are large and resemble to a large extent the 

 forked plates of certain species of Codaster and PheenoHchisma^ 

 in which the limbs — the prongs of the fork — of two contiguous 

 radials extend up between the arms in an almost vertical direc- 

 tion, but instead of forming, as there, a sort of pyramid, they 

 are extended in Stephanocrinus frequently into long thornlike 

 processes, which sometimes attain more than one-half the height 

 of the calyx up to the arm bases. These processes form radially 

 a deep gutter, containing the ambulacral groove which leads to 

 the arms. 



The second radials rest within a horseshoe-like depression near 

 the outer end of the gutter. The plates are reniform, small, short, 

 axillary, with three conspicuous prong-like projections extending 




216 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



inward. The outer ones of these projections are wing-like, rest- 

 ing against, and partly upon, the interradials ; the inner one 

 sword-shaped, their sharp point extended deeply into the ambu- 

 lacral groove, so as to divide it, and to form a branch groove for 

 each main division of the rays. Stephavocrinus angulaius evi- 

 dently had ten arms to the ra}^ but the mode of branching 

 beyond the second radials is not well known. We found, how- 

 ever, in one instance the second radial succeeded by two other 

 axillaries. The arms are biserial, thin, short, pinnule-like, and 

 they cover the whole ventral surface. In length they do not 

 extend beyond the interradial processes, which apparenth'^ were 

 to protect these delicate organs. 



The interradials are comparatively large. They resemble in 

 form and position the deltoids of Codasler, Troostocrinus and 

 other Blastoids, in which, like here, no part of the plates is visi- 

 ble in a side view. Tlie^^ extend to the top of the projections and 

 rest against the inner faces of two limbs, the suture running 

 downwards so as to divide the processes into an inner and outer 

 part. The plates are connected laterally with one another, but 

 not centrally. They leave in the centre a moderately large open 

 space, which in perfect specimens is filled by oral plates. The 

 lateral edges of the interradials are deflected, curving downward, 

 so as to form a wide and deep ambulacral groove, which on 

 approaching the inner end becomes deeper and narrower, and 

 toward the arm bases divides as stated above. The ambulacral 

 grooves are readily distinguished from the general gutter formed 

 by the protuberances. The}' contain neither hydrospires, nor 

 pores, nor other openings, but there seem to be small axial canals 

 at the arm bases. At each side of the ambulacral groove there is 

 a sort of depression, which forms a place of attachment for two 

 series of small, subquadrangular covering pieces, which form a 

 vault over the groove, leaving underneath a circular, compara- 

 tively large passage, which at one end communicates with the 

 arms, at the other enters the calyx beneath the edge of the oral 

 pyramid. The covering plates of the same series are so closely 

 anchylosed that they appear in the best specimens, even under a 

 magnifier, as two single plates, one at each side, as which they 

 were figured by Hall. Their composite nature and alternate 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 211 



arrangement, however, was ascertained in places where portions 

 of this integument had been weathered. 



The oral pyramid, which occupies the centre of figure, is placed 

 on a level with the covering pieces to which it is closely attached. 

 It rests against the truncated margins of the interradials, which 

 for its reception ai'e slightly excavated. It is composed of five 

 subequal pieces, which are so closely united by suture laterally 

 and centrally, that the suture lines are rarely visible, and the 

 plates appear as if forming a single piece. . 



The anal aperture is located ventrally, near the top of one of 

 the interradial processes, at the place where two of the limbs meet 

 with the interradial. In its usual preservation it consists of a 

 rather large circular opening, which, however, in perfect speci- 

 mens is closed by a valve of fi'om four to six small pieces.

Notes on the TJnderbasals and Top Stemjoint of Neocrinoidea 



AND PaL^OCRINOIDEA. 



On p. 8 we stated that probably many Neocrinoids, heretofore 

 supposed to be monocyclic, either have small underbasals con- 

 cealed beneath the column, or that these plates had been repre- 

 sented in the early larva. We referred to the genera Pentacrinus, 

 Millericrinus and Apiocrinus^ which, according to our generaliza- 

 tions on p. T, are built decidedly on the plan of dicyclic Palseo- 

 crinoids. Our investigation, unfortunately, could be extended 

 only to comparatively few species, as the column and axial canal 

 of the Neocrinoidea very frequently, and even among the genera 

 to which we alluded, are not angular, and Pentacrinus among the 

 three is the only genus that has lateral cirrhi. 



Rudimentary underbasals are known, to exist in the Pentacri- 

 noid genus Extracrinus, and similar plates have been discovered 

 in the Apiocrinidae by Mr. De Loriol in two species of Millericrinus. 

 In these species, as in the case of Extracrinus, the angles of the 

 column, when this is pentangular, are interradial, the canals radial, 

 exactly as in species in which underbasals are supposed to be 

 wanting, but contrary to the conditions of monocyclic PaljBocri- 

 noids in which the angles of the column are radial, the axial canals 

 interradial. 



Millericrinus polydactylus, according to Mr. Ue Loriol (Mono- 

 graph of the French Crinoids, p. 553, PI. 110, figs. 1 a and 2 a)^, 

 has five minute plates within the basal ring, which were regarded 

 by him as " infrabasalia," the term which he applies to under- 

 basals. De Loriol describes these plates as follows : " Je distingue 

 trhs nettement, sur deux individus, cinq pieces extremement 

 petites, a peine distinctes a I'oeil nu, qui son logees au centre de 

 Particle basal, chacune reposant sur le sommet de I'une des 

 carfenes, dans une direction radiale ; au centre se trouve une 

 petite depression qui forme le fond de la cavite. Ces petites 

 pieces, que je n'avais jamais encore observees, jouent eviderament 

 le role de pieces infrabasales, mais a I'^tat tout a fait rudimen- 



1 By an error it was stated on p. 7 in Rule 2 : the five sections of the 

 column are *' radial,'^ the longitudinal sutures "m/erradial," which should 

 read : the five sections of the column are " iraiferradial, " the longitudinal 

 sutures "radial." 



'^ This and the succeeding quotations are made from the Paleontologie 

 Franqaise, Ire Serie, Animaux Invertebres, Terrain Jurassique, Tome xi,

taire." Similar pieces were discovered by him in his Millericri- 

 nus Orbignyi (PI. 116, figs. 1 b,c,d), upon which he says on p. 

 566 : " Elles ne peuvent absolument se voir que lorsque, par un 

 hasard heureux, Particle basal peut se degager du calice. II me 

 parait indubitable que ce sont la de petites pieces infrabasales 

 rudimentaires semblables a celles que j'ai signalees dans le Mill, 

 polydactylus.^^ 



We fully agree with the distinguished Swiss palaeontologist 

 that the plates in question in both cases are rudimentary under- 

 basals, from the very fact that the plates are disposed radially, 

 the outer angles of the column interradially, as seen in 3Iill. 

 Orbignyi^ in which the stem is pentangular. 



Admitting these plates to be underbasals, we doubt if all 

 other species of Millericrinus, which have an interradial pentan- 

 gular stem, and those with a round stem, and the species of Apio- 

 crinus, a genus which, according to De Loriol, is closely allied to 

 3Iillericrinus, should be devoid of underbasals. In that case the 

 two species should be separated from the others, and be placed by 

 themselves under a very distinct genus. 



That small underbasals at least temporarily were represented 

 in other species of Millericrinus and in Apiocrinus, is indicated 

 by the fact that the open space within the basal ring, which in 

 Millericrinus Orbignyi is occupied by the underbasals, is radial, 

 contrary to the axial canals of monocyclic Palgeocrinoids, which 

 are interradial. Moreover, the space is not in proportion to the 

 axial canal in the stem, which in both genera is small and 

 circular. The space in these species is large enough to have con- 

 tained, in addition to the axial canal, such small plates as De 

 Loriol figured in Millericrinus Orbigny, and these, if present, 

 would take the same position as the underbasals in that species. 



In all dicyclic Crinoids, the column rests either exclusively 

 against the underbasals, or, when these are very small, also partly 

 against the basals. The latter is the case in the two species of 

 Millericrinus where underbasals are known to be present. In 

 these species they form together with the basals a deep concavity 

 for the reception of the top stem joint, which occupies the whole 

 concavity, as beautifully shown by De Loriol in 3Iill. polydactylus 

 (PI. 110, fig. 1 a). In other species of Millericrinus in which 

 no underbasals have been observed, and in the genus Apiocrinus^ 

 the structure is fundamentally the same, except that the columnar 

 concavity is formed exclusively by the basals, the underbasals 




220 PROOEEDINQS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



being here absent, and the space which they should fill left vacant 

 in the fossil. In all these species the top stem joint occupies the 

 same position toward the basals that it does in the two 

 species in which the underbasals are in place, although the 

 plate varies considerably in form. In some of them it ap- 

 pears as if forming a part of the calyx, in others as an ordinary 

 stem joint. In some species it is much wider than the succeeding 

 joints, in others of the same width ; but there ai'e all possible 

 gradations between the extremes. In all of them, however, the 

 plate rests against the outer walls of the basals as in Mill, poly- 

 dactylus, not within the basal ring, and in all of them the basal 

 concavity, whether large or small, is completely filled by the top 

 stem joint. 



It is very interesting that in the two cases in which De Loriol 

 accidentally discovered underbasals, these were separated from 

 the basals, and are closely attached to the column, which goes to 

 prove that probably already a partial resorption of the plates 

 took place. It suggests further that the union with the under- 

 basals was tighter than with the basals, that probably the former 

 was eflfected by common suture, the other by syzygy or some other 

 loose way, the apposed faces being either striated or showing 

 traces of fossjie. 



A near approach to the structure of Millericrinus polydactylus 

 we find in Mill. Piletti (PI. 63), in which no underbasals were 

 observed, but the lateral faces of the basals (fig. 8 a) show clearly 

 that underbasals were once present. The column also here, from 

 the first joint down, is strictly interradial, the axial canal small 

 and round, and not in proportion to the large open space between 

 the basals. The basal concavit}^ is funnel-shaped, very deep, 

 wide at the outer end. The upper stem joint is large, and extends 

 in width considerably beyond all succeeding joints. 



A similar base exists in Mill. 3Iilleri (PL 96), in which again 

 the upper columnar joint is laterally extended and strictly inter- 

 radial, the columnar canal round, and much smaller than the 

 open space within the basal ring, which is star-shaped, the rays 

 directed radially. 



A very different base is figured by De Loriol in Apiocrinus 

 magnificus (Pts. 46-48), in which the top stem joint takes the 

 form of the anchylosed underbasal disk of the Palaeocrinoid genus 

 Stemmatocrinus. A comparison, however, with other species 

 proves very clearly, that it is a top stem joint of a very extreme 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 221 



form, and that the plate actually rests against the outer faces of 

 the basals, and not between the basals as in the case of the inner 

 plate in Stemmatocrinus and Cupressocrinus, which Carpenter 

 (Chall. Rep., p. 152), as we think, erroneously took to be a stem 

 joint. The plate in Apiocrinus magnificus is not, as should be 

 supposed from appearances, disposed radiall}'', but interradially, 

 as shown by comparison with species having a pentangular stem. 

 It attained its radial angles accidentally by adapting its form to 

 the basal concavity which is naturally angular. The case is parallel 

 to that of Eucalyptocrinus and Barrandeocrinus^ in which the 

 angles of the upper column are shaped so as to conform with 

 surrounding plates, which are in that genus the radials. 



In Apiocrinus Parkinsoni (Pts. 27 and 28) and in A. roissyanus 

 (Pts. 41-45), the basal structure is similar to that of Ichlhyocrinus, 

 but, while in the latter the underbasals are persistent through 

 life, they may have disappeared in the other. The basal concavity is 

 shallow, and in both species the upper portions of the column taper 

 abruptly' in a downward direction. The same is the case fre- 

 quently among the Ichthyocrinidse. 



The base of Guettardicrinus and Rhizocrinus is in a similar 

 condition, but less concave. For Rhizocrinus we refer to the 

 Challenger Report, PI. x, figs. 5 and 9. The top stem joint 

 resembles closely that of Apiocrinus^ and also the basal con- 

 cavity, which also here is filled completely by the top joint. The 

 columnar canal is circular or ovoid, and much smaller than the 

 pentangular space within the basal ring, which, contrary to mono- 

 C3'clic Crinoids, is directed radially. The same is the case in 

 Guettardicrinus. Both genera are built on the same plan as 

 Apiocrinus, and if the latter possessed underbasals, these plates 

 were also present in Rhizocrinus and Guettardicrinus. 



In the Pentracrinida?, and not only in Extracrinus, in which 

 underbasals have been observed, but also in Pentracrinus and 

 Metacrinus in which they are said to be absent, the angles of 

 the column, without exception, are interradial, the lateral cirrhi 

 radial, but, while the axial canals of Metacrinus, and probably 

 Extracrinus, are radial ' in conformity with dicyclic Palseocri- 

 noids, they are interradial in Pentacrinus^ as in all monocy-

clic older Crinoids. This departure from what we discovered to 

 be the rule in the Palaeoerinoidea induced us not to mention the 

 axial canals in suggesting on p. 11 that perhaps " all Neocrinoids, 

 or at least many of them, may have possessed in their larval state 

 rudimentary underbasals hidden by the column," basing our argu- 

 ments mainly upon the interradial angles of the column and the 

 radial position of the columnar cirrhi. This forms at present an 

 objection to our view that the two genera, and especiall}^ Penta- 

 crinus, are dicj'Clic. On the other hand it must not be over- 

 looked that the position of the column, whether radial or intei*- 

 radial, apparently is governed by laws similar to those by which 

 the underbasals are radial, the basals interradial. The pentapar- 

 tite stem — and this is found in quite a number of palaeozoic genera, 

 especially Silurian — alternates always with the proximal ring of 

 plates, the segments are radial when there are basals only, inter- 

 radial when also underbasals are present. In Paloeocrinoids in 

 which the column is undivided and pentangular, its position, 

 whether radial or interradial, is ascertained from its lateral angles, 

 and hence their direction morphologically important. In species 

 in which the underbasals are small, and completely coyered by 

 the column, as sometimes in Barycrinus, the angles of the column 

 occupy the same relative position toward the basals, as the upper 

 stem joint of Metacrinus, Pentacrinus, Millericrinus and the cen- 

 trodorsal of all Comatulse does toward their basals. This led us 

 to the conclusion that either the rules, which meet with no excep- 

 tion among Palaeoerinoidea, as far as we know, either do not hold 

 good for the Neocrinoidea, or the genera to which we alluded, 

 and which are built otherwise upon the plan of dicyclic Crinoids, 

 really possessed rudimentar}^ underbasals during life as Extracri- 

 nus and certain species of Millericrinus, or that perhaps under- 

 basals were present in their larva. 



The ventral surface of the centrodorsal in some species of 

 Antedon is almost identical with that of the top stem joint of 

 Millericrinus, th.e plate is also interradial (PL 6, fig. 11), and 

 rests, as in the Apiocrinidae, against the outer face of the basals, 

 not within the basal ring. It is similar in other Comatulse, in all 

 of which the centrodorsal is interradial, and upon this mainly, we 

 base the opinion that perhaps also the Comatulae in their early 

 larva had rudimentary underbasals. That these plates, if present, 

 were not observed, is not surprising, as they may have been very 

 minute and been covered entirely by the column. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 223 



Zittel suggested (Handb. d. Palseont., i, p. 390), that the plate 

 which conueets with the basals in Apiocrinus probably repre- 

 sented an anchylosed underbasal disk, composed of five pieces. 

 That this is impossible is shown by the case of Mill, polydactylus, 

 which' in that case would have two rings of underbasals. We 

 fully agree with De Loriol and Carpenter that it is an enlarged 

 stem joint, and believe that the plate represents morphologically 

 the top joint (the first one beneath the basals) of all Crinoids, 

 recent or fossil. The plate forms no integral part of the calyx, 

 but rests in all cases either against the dorsal (outer) face of the 

 basals, against the underbasals, or against both of them. It is 

 disposed interradially in the Apiocrinidse, Pentacrinidse and Com- 

 atulae, similar to dicyclic Paloeocrinoids, and undivided ; while in 

 other groups it is sometimes compound (tripartite or quinquepar- 

 tite). The underbasals, however, form an integral part of the 

 calyx, they rest within the basal ring, against the lateral faces of 

 the plates, and they are composed primarilj'- of five pieces, which 

 occasionally are reduced by anchylosis to three, or coalesced into 

 a solid disk. If this is correct, it follows that the inner plate of 

 Stemmatocrimis, Cupressocrinus and allied genera is not a stem 

 joint, as suggested by Carpenter (Chall. Rep. 153) and others, 

 but an anchylosed underbasal disk, as seen by examining the 

 inner side of the calyx, which shows that the plate forms a part 

 of the calyx, and rests against the lateral faces of. the basals, 

 within the basal ring, and not against their outer faces.

FresJi-water Sponges from Newfoundland : A new Species. — 

 Mr. Edward Potts stated that in the latter part of August, 1885, 

 Mr. A. H. MacKay, of Pictou, Nova Scotia, whose success as a 

 collector of fresh-water sponges in his own neighborhood has 

 been already recorded (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1884, p. 215, 

 etc.), made a scientific visit to the island of Newfoundland. His 

 explorations were mainly limited to the irregular peninsula of 

 Avalon, the southeasterly extrerait}^ of the island, and the record 

 of his collections beside mentioning the neighborhood of the 

 city of St. Johns, embraces such familiar names as Trinity Bay, 

 Harbor Grace, and Heart's Content, the landing place of the 

 Atlantic cable. 



He writes " I was extremely sorry that owing to my limited 

 time and the impenetrability of the interior to an}^ ordinary 

 effort, I could not gain access to the great lakes in the heart and 

 the western portion of the island. I have merely made a dip into 

 a few of the ponds on the N. (?) E. coast." These are more par- 

 ticularly mentioned as Virginia and Ouidi Yidi Lakes, near St. 

 Johns ; Lady Lake, Bannerman Lake, Rocky Lake and Car- 

 bonear Lake, small bodies of water near Harbor Grace ; and 

 other lakelets and brooks upon the rocky ridges and near the 

 sea level between Harbor Grace and Heart's Content. All this 

 region is described as "the Canadian Huronian, the equivalent of 

 the English Cambrian," and the collections were generally 

 limited to the shallow margins of the ponds, where the sponges 

 were found upon the under sides of splinters of hard slaty 

 quartzites, in numbers ver^' plentiful, but generally small ; " from 

 mere points to an inch or more in diameter." 



It is to be regretted that the date of Mr. MacKay's visit was 

 necessarily so early in the A'ear, as the specimens collected were 

 either immature or contained onlj^ the degenerate statoblasts of 

 the preceding season. The information gathered as to the range 




228 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



of temperature upon this island, is valuable as indicating so far 

 the conditions of the growth of these and other organisms. 



He says : " The Island is not extreme in its temperature, and 

 the frost does not go very deep into the soil. The lakes freeze 

 in November or December with ice at least a foot in thickness, 

 and remain closed until the end of April. The average tempera- 

 ture during eight years, from 185Y to 1864, was 41*2° Fahr. 

 Average maximum thermometer during the same time 83°, 

 minimum 7°. In the year 1879, the mean temperature was 40*2° 

 Fahr.; highest record August 3, 82°; lowest December 22, +4°. 

 In Nova Scotia, though that is so much further south, the range 

 is far greater, from +96° to — 20° or — 24° Fahr., with an annual 

 average of 44°." 



The specimens of sponges so kindly forwarded by Mr. MacKay 

 for examination and report, were more or less minute incrusta- 

 tions upon small stones, gathered as above indicated, and 

 belonged to the species Spongilla lacustris, Auct. ; S. fragilis, 

 Leidy ; S. mackayi, Carter ; Mexjenia fiuviatilis^ Auct., and 

 Ileteromey enia pictovensis ajid Tuhella pennsylvanica^ Potts. Of 

 these, Si'yongilla fragilis was b}'^ far the most abundant, and our 

 knowledge of its range is thus extended along the Eastern coast 

 of North America from Florida to Newfoundland ; whereas it 

 had previously been traced westwardly to British Columbia 

 near the Pacific Ocean, and more recently has been discovered in 

 Russia, Bohemia and England. Beside the familiar species, S. 

 lacuatris^ S. fragilis and M. fluviatilis, Tubella pennsylvanica 

 has been rapidly enlarging its borders beyond the narrow limits 

 of its original territorial designation ; while S. mackayi and H. 

 pictovensis had previously been known only from the discoveries 

 of Mr. MacKay in Nova Scotia. 



One other form remains to be described, and at the suggestion 

 of its discoverer it is hereby designated — 



Spongilla Nov^ Terk^, n. sp. 



Sponge incrusting ; sarcode of the young growth, a dense 

 mass of minute spherical cells, embedding slender curving lines 

 of fasciculated skeleton spicules, developing later into a very 

 loose, open tissue, with few connecting spicules. 



Gemmules rather numerous, unusually large, spherical ; chitin- 

 ous coat thin ; " crust " apparentlj^ wanting. 



Skeleton spicules relatively few, slender, cylindrical, smooth 

 or sparsely microspined ; gradually pointed. 



Dermal or flesh spicules very abundant, minute birotulates of 

 unequal size ; shafts slender, cylindrical, occasionally spined ; 

 outer surface of rotules dome shaped ; rays prolonged, termina- 

 tions acute ; malformations frequent. Mixed with occasional 

 linear, spined spicules. 




1886.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



229 



Spicules upon the gemmulse abundant, crossing each other 



upon the crustless, chitinous 

 body. Their shape when 

 smooth is robust -fusiform, 

 with pointed terminations ; 

 the great majorit}^ however, 

 have from one to six or more 

 long spines, non- symmetri- 

 cally placed, but with an 

 evident tendency to group 

 themselves at points about 

 one-fourth the length of the 

 spicule from one or both of 

 its extremities. 



Measurements : Diameter 

 of gemmules 0'036 inches ; 

 skeleton spicules, 0*0008 by 0'0002 inches ; length of average 

 dermal spicule, 0*00066 inches ; of gemmula spicule, 0'00145 

 inches. 



Habitat. — Encrusting stones in shallow water. 

 Locality. — Lakes or ponds in the vicinity of Heart's Content, 

 Newfoundland ; collected by Mr. A. H. MacKay. 



All the specimens of this sponge came from the neighborhood 

 of Heart's Content, but whether t\iQy were gathered from a lake 

 upon the heights or from a brook mentioned by Mr. MacKay near 

 the sea level, does not seem entii'ely clear. The accompanying 

 illustration (magnified 225 diameters) will suggest the peculiari- 

 ties of its skeleton, dermal and gemmular spiculation. The 

 striking resemblance of the dermal spicules to the minute 

 birotulates, heretofore only known in a corresponding position, 

 in the case of Meyenia everetti, will at once impress the student. 

 These are however more variable in size, are occasionally spined, 

 and have their rays more prolonged and more delicately ter- 

 minated. 



It is in the singular character of the spicules surrounding the 

 gemmula? that this sponge must attract peculiar attention. By 

 the system of H. J. Carter, Esq., the fresh-water sponges are 

 now classified into six genera, beside some conditional designa- 

 tions of forms in which the typical features are as yet undis- 

 covered. These six, Spongilla, Meyenia, Heferomeyenia, Tubella, 

 Farmula and Carterius, may again be associated into two 

 groups, one of them including only the genus Spongilla, charac- 

 terized by the linear acerate spicules surrounding the gemmulse ; 

 and the other comprising all the other genera, where the spicule 

 of corresponding significance is a birotulate or some easily recog- 

 nized derivative of that type. Within this latter and larger 

 group intermediate forms, connecting the defined genera, are 

 frequent, and the location of species upon, one side or other of 




230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



the distinctive line comparatively unimportant. Heretofore, 

 between the genus Spongilla and those genera comprising the 

 other group, there has been " a great gulf fixed." One only case 

 in the past has suggested their possible association, or the 

 development of one group from the other. 



In Meyenia acuminata, Potts (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 

 1882, p. 69), since regarded as a variety of M. jluviatilis, the 

 shafts of the birotulates are prolonged at each extremity, form- 

 ing acuminate terminations some distance be3^ond the surface of 

 the rotules. In position, also, these spicules are abnormal, lying 

 flat upon the chitinous coat, instead of resting upon one rotule, 

 their shafts taking the position of radii, as is usual in this form. 

 In fact we have the spicules of a Me3'enia occupying the ordinary 

 positions, and in degree approximating the forms of those pecu- 

 liar to the Spongilla?. 



In the present instance their intermediate character is still 

 more striking, and while their form and position probably more 

 closel^^ associate them with the genus Spongilla in whicli the 

 species has now been placed, the grouping of the raj' -like species 

 clearly suggests 3Ieyenia. It has been an altogether unprece- 

 dented experience with the author to hesitate between these two 

 genera, and it will be no cause of surprise if the future teacher 

 shall Shift it from its present position. 



It must not escape notice that in both of these instances the 

 gemmulae are without " crust;" — that it is difficult to understand 

 how birotulates could be supported in their ordinar}^ positions 

 ivithout these embedding granules ; and that we may not unrea- 

 sonably infer that the change in position has induced the modifi- 

 cation of type that we here find. 



This collection of sponges, including the new species, has been 

 examined coincidently by H, J. Carter, Esq., F. R. S., and their 

 identification and this description are believed to meet his 

 approval.

On Anthracomartus Trilobitus Scud. — Prof. F. L. Harvey re- 

 marked that the coal field of North Arkansas belongs to the 

 western interior coal area, wliich covers the greater part of Mis- 

 souri, and extends into Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Indian Territoiy, 

 Arkansas and Texas. This vast field covers 78,000 square miles, 

 of which about 10,000 are in Arlvansas and 12,000 in the Indian 

 Territory. It belongs to the lowest, the suhconglomerate. The 

 veins occur in the shales of the millstone grit, less than 100 feet 

 above the Archimedes limestone. There is only one vein in the 

 northern limit, which is from eight to eighteen inches thick. In 

 the Arkansas River valley there are three veins which often have 

 an aggregate thickness of over six feet. The veins lie high in the 

 hills in the Boston Mountains, but the southward dip brings them 

 in the Arkansas River valley , beneath the drainage of the country. 

 The veins in north Arkansas are worked in a limited way by 

 scalping and drifting, but shaft mining is done at Coal Hill, 

 Spadra and other points and there is at present considerable 

 coal exported to New Orleans down the Arkansas valley route. 



The conditions were most favorable for the preservation of plant 

 remains. Beautifully preserved plants occur in the shales above 

 the coal vein of northwest Arkansas and limited research in 

 Washington County alo*ne yielded the speaker over 100 species 

 new to the State and fifteen new to science. 



While searching for fossil plants in the brash shale near the 

 coal, a specimen of fossil spider was found. By carefully work- 

 ing over a few tons of shale several more specimens were procured. 

 The material was sent to Prof. Scudder for examination and he 

 named the form Anthracomartus trilobitus^ sp, nov. It is believed 

 to be the only species of the genus found in the coal measures of 

 the United States. The genus was founded upon a single Euro- 

 pean species. It is interesting that a second species should be 

 found so far separated. Fossil insects are scarce in the suhcon- 

 glomerate, and the three known from Arkansas are, a wing of 

 Blatlina venusta, discovered by Prof. Lesquereux and figured in 

 Owen's Report of Arkansas, vol. ii, p. 312 ; the species of spider 

 under consideration and an undescribed Neuropterous larva in 

 the cabinet of the speaker. The description and figure of this 

 Anthracomartus, so far as we know, has not been published, 

 but is enumerated in Mr. R. D. Lacoe's " Check List of 

 Palaeozoic Insects." Less than a dozen specimens are known and 

 they are in the cabinets of Prof. Scudder, Mr. R. D. Lacoe and 

 the speaker, besides the specimen presented to the Academy 




232 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



this evening. The specimens are all imperfect, showing only 

 the abdomen and a part of the cephalothorax. The most of them 

 were compressed vertically and give a transverse view. The 

 compressed abdomen reminds one of the pygidium of a trilobite, 

 hence the specific name. A single specimen compressed laterally 

 shows well the elevated and rounded abdomen characteristic of 

 our modern spiders. The cephalothorax is minutely punctate. 

 The species is interesting as occurring at the base of the coal 

 measures. The locality is no longer worked and the species may 

 be considered scarce. 



Messrs. Calvin McCormick and Samuel Wagner were elected

In this paper I have attempted to give the synonymy of the 

 American species of G aster osteidse with analytical keys for their 

 identification, and such notes as my studies of the group seem 

 to justify. The specimens examined all belong to the Museum 

 of the Indiana University. 



I am indebted to Dr. David S. Jordan for the use of his library 

 and for many suggestions.

This genus is characterized by the presence of 1 to 11 divergent 

 dorsal spines and by the weakness of the innominate bones. It 

 differs from Gasterosteus also, in having the posterior margin of 

 the gill membrane free and by the less development of the spin- 

 ous armature. 



But a single species, variable in its characters, seems to be 

 known. It is widely distributed in the fresh and brackish waters 

 of northern regions.

Habitat. — Shores of Northern Europe and Eastern America 

 South to New York, also in the great Lakes and northward ; var. 

 hrachypoda in the North Pacific, the specimens examined by me 

 are from Calumet Lake, Ills., and from Massachusetts. 



The synonomy of this species, as given above, needs a word of 

 remark. 



The pungitivus of Walbaum is of course identical with the 

 pungitius of LinnfBUS. 



I cannot see that east coast specimens, representing the occi- 

 dentalis of Cuvier and Valenciennes, and that of Dekay, differ 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 23t 



at all from descriptions of the European pungitius, but I have 

 had no specimens of the latter for direct comparison. I cannot, 

 therefore, regard occidentalis as a separate species or variety. 

 The dehayi of Agassiz is based on the occidentalis of Dekay ; 

 I have therefore placed it also in the synonymy of pungitius. 



The mainensis of Storer is said to differ from pungitius only 

 in having a " bony serrated plate on the side." This probably 

 refers to the plate behind the pectorals. 



The concinnus of Richardson is said to differ in having seven 

 dorsal spines, but as the number seems to vary from 7 to 11, this 

 cannot be considered as a specific character. I have examined 

 specimens from Calumet, R. Illinois (presumably representing 

 the form called nebulosus). I can find no difference whatever 

 between these and Massachusetts examples of pungititis. 



The var. brachypoda seems to differ from pungitius only in the 

 shorter ventral spines. It is known to me only from the descrip- 

 tion of Dr. Bean (above cited). 



2. ETJCALIA. 

 Eucalia Jordan, Man. Vert., ed. i, 248, 1876 {inconstans) . 



This genus is closely allied to Pygosteus, agreeing with it in 

 the structure of the gill membranes, but differing in having the 

 ■dorsal spines few and non-divergent, and in having the innomi- 

 nate bones more fully united. The species are the most feebly 

 armed of the Sticklebacks. 



Analysis of Species of Eucalia. 

 a. Body moderately robust, the caudal peduncle not very slender; 

 depth 4 in length to base of caudal. Head pointed ; 

 mouth small, very oblique ; maxillary reaching to anterior 

 margin of eye ; teeth small, stout, in a single series ; 

 eye large, much longer than snout. Caudal peduncle 

 moderately compressed, 7^ times in length to base of 

 caudal. No bony dermal plates ; skin naked ; no post- 

 opercular (suprascapular) plate ; post-pectoral plate covered 

 by skin ; skin of head not ossified. Lateral line beginning 

 at upper angle of preopercle and curved to below fourth 

 dorsal spine, from where it goes straight to middle of tail ; 

 a second row of tubes is seen for a small distance along its 

 origin. A patch of mucous pores at beginning of lateral 

 line ; a row along the edge of the preopercle and a c-shaped

row at nape. Dorsal spines about equal to one-half diame- 

 ter of eye, tlie first just reaching base of second ; these 

 spines are recurved and slightly serrate on their edges ; 

 the fifth spine is more recurved and higher than the others. 

 Soft dorsal very high in front, its longest ray about equal 

 to snout and half the orbit ; the last ray equals half the 

 orbit ; caudal short and broad ; anal inserted below inser- 

 tion of second dorsal, similar to and coterminous with it. 

 Pectorals short and broad, their length equal to their 

 breadth at tips. Yertebrae (cayuga), 14 + 18. Brownish with 

 lighter blotches and black points. Males in spring black, 

 tinged with red on the jaws and snout.

The specimens of the tj'pical inconstans examined by me are 

 from Rock River, Illinois. 



Those of the var. cayuga are from Syracuse, New York. 



The micropus of Cope would seem to differ in its shape, being 

 shorter and deeper, and in having a smaller post-pectoral plate 

 and ventral spines. All of these characters are of doubtful per- 

 manence. 



The globiceps of Sauvage offers no peculiar characters. 



The var. cayuga seems to differ from inconstans in having 

 longer ventral spines and smaller post-pectoral plates ; it is per- 

 haps identical with it. 



The pygmsea of Agassiz is said to differ from inconstans in 

 having the body shorter and deeper, and in the number of fin 

 rays. The difference in form is of no importance, and it is not 

 likely that the alleged difference in the fin rays is real. 



?,. GASTEROSTEUS. 



Oasterosteus Artedi, Gen. Pise, 52, 1738. 



Gasterosteus Liimaaus, Syst. Nat. Ed. x, i, 295, 1758 (aculeatus). 



Gasteracanthus Pallas, "Zoogr. Ro.sso. Asiatica, iii, 228," 1811 (cafa-

 Leiurus Swainson, Nat. Hist. Class Fishes, ii, 242, 1839 (gymnurus, etc.). 



This genus is distinguished from Pygosteus and eucalia in hav- 

 ing the posterior margin of the gill membrane joined to the isth- 

 mus. The body is more robust ; the spines and innominate bones 

 much stronger ; the pubic bones very broad and little divergent. 

 Its species are the strongest of the sticklebacks and the most

fully armed. All of them are very variable and very closely 

 related one to another. The species with the bony plates most 

 developed are most marine in their habit, while the partly or 

 wholly naked forms seem rather to inhabit the rivers. It may 

 be that a complete gradation exists from the fully armed aculeatus 

 to the naked williamsoni, in which case all these forms should 

 be regarded as varieties of aculeatus. All northern regions seem 

 to possess full mailed species (aculeatus and vars.) and half 

 mailed species (allies of gymnurus). The former type seems 

 identical on both sides of the Atlantic, but the latter type so far 

 as our specimens can show seems to be different in America from 

 any described in Europe.

 San Francisco to Alaska and Kamtschatka. 



This species differs from the others in having the whole sides 

 coA'^ered with (28-30) bony plates. 



The biaculeatus of Mitchill possesses the (33) plates charac- 

 izing the aculeatus and otherwise agrees with the latter ; the 

 slight variation in the number of lateral plates may perhaps 

 arise from a different manner of counting them. 



The bispinosus of Walbaum and biaculeatus of Shaw are alike 

 based on Pennant. The description given by the latter author is 

 of very little importance, but the probabilities all favor that the 

 species he had in mind was Gasterosteus aculeatus. 



The novebo7'acensis of Cuvier and Valenciennes is said to 

 differ from aculeatus in the position of the lateral line and in the 

 stronger caudal keel. Neither of these features is likely to be 

 of specific value, and I therefore place it in the synonymy of 

 aculeatus. 



The niger of Cuvier is based on the biaculeatus of Mitchill, 

 which is aculeatus. The trachurus of the same author has the 

 sides completely covered with plates, and is, of course, the 

 ordinary European form of aculeatus. 



The svppositus of Sauvage is a supposed new species described 

 by Dekaj'' as neoboracensis, but the neobor-acensis of Dekay is 

 identical with the noveboracensis of Cuvier and Valenciennes, 

 and suppositus is therefore a synonym of aculeatus. The figure 

 of Dekay has lateral plates extending from the post-pectoral 

 plate to the caudal, but as this differs from the nature of the 

 armature of this group, and as Dekay does not mention the 

 naked area about the ventral region and gives the number of the 

 plates as 30 to 33, these discrepancies must be due to a mistake 

 of the artist. 



The Gasterosteus texanus of Sauvage is somewhat different. 

 It has eleven plates extending to the second ray of the soft 

 dorsal; thence to the last ray, the body is naked, the peduncle 

 being again mailed and strongly keeled. As no sticklebacks 

 are found much south of the Great Lake region, it is very prob- 

 able that the type of G. texanus did not come from Texas. At 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



present I place texanus in the synonymy of aculeatus, the pecu- 

 liarities above mentioned being perhaps due to mutilation. 



The many specimens examined by me are from Wilmington, 

 Delaware, and from Woods Holl, Massachusetts. 



The var. cataphractus differs from aculeatus in its deeper and 

 shorter form. Northern specimens are larger and more robust 

 than those found further south, and it is not likely that with a large 

 series any tangible permanent differences could be maintained. 



The names cataphractus and obolarius were given to Alaskan 

 specimens ; the insculptus from the Arctic is not essentially 

 different, and the serratus of Ay res and intermedius of Girard, 

 from further south, are also certainly the same. 



The large collections made by Jordan and Gilbert of the West 

 Coast of the U. S., show conclusively that not more than two 

 distinct forms of Sticklebacks, cataphractus and microcephalus, 

 exist on that coast,

 Lakes); Jordan & Gilbert, Syn. Fish. N. A., 395, 1883 (Copied). 



Habitat. — Schoodic Lakes, Maine. 



This species is characterized by the presence of 15 lateral 

 plates ; it is therefore intermediate between the full armed 

 aculeatus and the partly mailed gymnurus, etc. The species is 

 known to me from the description of Bean (loc. cit.). This 

 description indicates some affinity with the European Gasteros- 

 teus semiarmatus, which has also 14 (12 to 15) plates.

Habitat. — Pacific Coast North America, from Bering Strait 

 south to Todos Santos Bay. Ascends rivers. 



This species differs from dimidiatus in having no cusp at base of 

 ventrals and no caudal keel ; it differs from wheatlandi in having 

 all its bones much weaker and in the arrangement of the mucous 

 pores about the head. 



The collection of Jordan and Gilbert shows that all naked- 

 tailed Sticklebacks (microcephalus, plebeius, inopinatus and 

 pugetti) belong to one species. 



It is possible, as several writers have affirmed, that all these 

 naked-tailed Sticklebacks (gymnurus^ microcephalus, wheatlandi, 

 loilliamsoni) are simple varieties of the ordinary G. aculeatus. 

 It seems to me that the peculiarities of the Californian form are 

 so constant that we may regard this one at least as presenting 

 a distinct species. Of G. wheatlandi and gymnurus I am not so 

 certain, but I have not yet seen any distinctly intermediate 

 forms, although all these types, like all other Sticklebacks, are 

 subject to much individual variation. The characters given in 

 the analysis above are to be regarded as simply provisional, as 

 representing the differences shown by the material at my disposal. 



The specimens examined by me are from San Diego, Cal.

 at the base of the ventrals and a fleshy caudal carina. 



The name biaculeatus cannot be retained for this species, as it 

 was originally based on a description of Pennant which appar- 

 ently refers to G. aculeatus.

 Apeltes Dekay, Nat. Hist, N. Y., 67, 1843 {quadracus no description). 

 Apeltes Jordan, Man. Vert., 249, 1876 (Characterized). 



This genus is distinguished by the form and position of the 

 innominate bones, these being separated and forming subdermal 

 spines on the outer edges of the abdomen. The pubic bones are 

 small and weak, not visible on surface. It is a more sharply de- 

 fined group than Eucalia or Pygosteus and its single species has 

 shown no important variation. 



Analysis of Species of Apeltes. 

 a. Trunk oblong; head pointed; caudal peduncle slender, not 

 keeled. Mouth small, horizontal ; maxillary not reaching 

 to eye ; teeth slender, in a single series. No bony dermal 

 plates along sides. Scapula forming a small granulated post- 

 opercular plate. Innominate bones wide apart ; the area 

 between them flat so that a section of the fish is triangular. 

 Gill membrane broadly united to the isthmus. Free dorsal 

 spines divergent. The spines slender, pointed, slightly 

 serrate. Distance between first and third spine much less 

 than that between third and fourth ; the first extending 

 beyond base of third. Caudal long, narrow ; anal similar 

 to soft dorsal and coterminous with it ; its spine under third 

 ray of dorsal. Ventral spines strong, subterete ; serrate on 

 both edges and covered by skin to near tip. When ventral 

 spines are set they point almost sidewise, when depressed 

 they lie along inside of innominate bones. Quadracus. 9.

Habitat. — Atlantic Coast of North America ; Northward. 



This species is easily distinguished by the separation of the 

 innominate bones and by the four divergent dorsal spines. 



The apeltes of Cuvier and Valenciennes does not differ from 

 the quadracus of Mitchill. 



The millipunctatus of Ayres is also identical with the quadra- 

 cus of Mitchill.

This genus differs from the others in the prolongation of the 

 snout which approaches in form the snout of Aulorhynchus and 

 Fistularia. The innominate bones are as in Apeltes ; there are 

 about 15 free dorsal spines. 



Analysis of the Species of Spinachia. 



a. Snout prolonged ; dorsal spines about 15; dermal plates, 40 ;

The Railway Cutting at Gray^s Ferry Road. — Mr. Aubrey H. 

 Smith remarked that the Schuylkill River, as is well known, 

 makes a curve to the westward just below the II. S. Arsenal 

 grounds, returning to its southwardly course at Harmar's wharf, 

 nearly a mile below. The new iron bridge of the Baltimore and 

 Ohio R. R. Co. spans the river obliquely from the northern side 

 of Bartram's Garden to Harmar's at the height of about 23 feet 

 above tide. The tract of land half enclosed by the river is ele- 

 vated about 50 feet above tide and is composed of the same 

 diluvial gravels and clays which form the plain on which stands 

 the old city of Philadelphia. 



The railroad proceeds from the bridge by a deep cut of half a 

 mile transversely to the streets on the city plan northeastwardly 

 to the low grounds on the river below the arsenal, thus forming 

 a chord to the arc of the river bend. The cut is a deep one, as 

 the railroad company was required by its agreement with the city 

 to construct its line beneath Wharton Street and the Gray's Ferry 

 Road. 



Soon after leaving tlie bridge the cutting enters the plateau and 

 is soon twenty-five or more feet deep. The excavation is through 

 yellow clays and river gravels to the depth of about twenty-five 

 feet. It then discloses a compact bed of dark blue clay, sharply 

 defined under the gravel, apparently a river deposit. Its thick- 

 ness is not exactly known but it exceeds six feet. This bed of 

 blue clay extends from just beyond the Harmar house to the 

 Gray's Ferry Road, a distance of 500 or 600 yards. 



It is apparently thickest near the Harmar house, but thins out 

 at the Gray's Ferry Road, where the excavations show it to be 

 only about four feet thick and to rest upon a bed of yellow gravel 

 or sand. It does not appear at all northeast of the Gray's Ferry 

 Road. 



Some observations and inquiry in November, 1885, for organic 

 remains resulted, so far as he was aware, only in showing that 

 the blue clay contains numerous genera and species of diatoms 

 and several species of recent woods. The observations on the 

 diatoms are due to Professor Koenig. The gravels and clays 

 above the blue clay were barren of all organic forms. The woods 

 then obtained were apparently birch, maple or oak, and were 

 neither mineralized or decomposed. They came from the dump 

 heap where the excavated clay was deposited by the workmen, 

 but are doubtless from the blue clay bed. 




254 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



The specimen of wood exhibited to the Academy to-night is of 

 some coniferous tree, probably a white cedar, Cupressus thyoides. 

 This tree, until very recently, was common along the Schuylkill 

 and Delaware, and isolated specimens may still exist there. The 

 wood now shown is in no degree mineralized and but slightly 

 decomposed. It came from a log which lies in the blue clay just 

 north of the Wharton Street Bridge and is still to be seen there. 

 No shells, so far as he knew, have been found in the excavation, 

 but more careful search in this direction might be rewarded. 



The blue clay bed appears to mark one of the periods of quies- 

 cence in the glacial action which, in its torrential course, scooped 

 out the valleys of the Schuylkill and Delaware and afterwards 

 filled them up again at the margin of tide-water. It harmonizes 

 itself with similar beds which have been observed at several points 

 along the shores of the rivers — notably at the Lazaretto and 

 Printz Hall, Tinicum, and near Camden, N. J. 



There were probabl}^ several of these periods of comparative 

 rest in the course of the retirement of the ice from northern 

 Pennsylvania. 



The artesian well of Mr. Black, at Black's Island, below Fort 

 Mifflin, which is 456 feet deep, disclosed at the depth of 100 feet

 of gravel and. clay. The decomposed gneiss rock was reached at 

 the depth of 240 feet or thereabouts.

cooked, measly pork, which had been eaten for a week from 

 January 6, 1886. The family consisted of a man and wife and 

 two daughters, aged respectively five and thirteen years. The 

 older daughter and the mother, aged 37 years, have died ; the 

 other members of the famil}^, although affected, are recovering. 

 In the mother, who died March 8, the deltoid muscle showed, 

 under the microscope, three to nine ; the rectus femoris, two to 

 six, and the diaphragm, one to three trichinaa, in a field view 

 about one-fifth of an inch in diameter. In the daughter, who 

 died February 19, ti'ichinte were found imbedded in the deltoid 

 muscle, in some portions as many as forty-two being counted on 

 the field of view under the microscope. No other portions of 

 the daughter were examined, but the lungs, heart, liver, spleen 

 and kidneys of the mother were found to be unaflfected. 



The pork used was home-raised, and, according to the owner, 

 the animal did not at any time show signs of ill health. An 

 examination of two other hogs raised on the premises was made, 

 but no trichinae were found. As usual in such cases, the meat 

 was imperfectly cooked or fried, the tenderloin, sausage meat, 

 spare ribs, etc., all being freely used. For several days while in 

 water the human trichinae showed signs of life, coiling and 

 imcoiling when freed from the muscular fibre, but the stage of 

 development found in the pork showed no activity under the same 

 conditions. The communication is accompanied by excellent 

 photographs of portions of human muscle and of the affected 

 pork, showing a number of the worms imbedded in the tissue.

A REVISION OF THE AMERICAN SPECIES OF THE GENUS GERRES. 

 BY BARTON W. EVERMANN AND SETH E. MEEK. 



In the summer of 1883 we published in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, pp. 116 to 124, a 

 " Review of the Species of Gerres found in American Waters." 

 In December of the same year, Dr. Jordan made a large collection 

 of the Atlantic species of this genus at Cedar Keys, Key West 

 and Havana. A large portion of this collection is now in the 

 Museum of the Indiana University, and constitutes the material 

 upon which the present paper is based. 



The present collections contain numerous specimens of species 

 not before examined by us, and, in the light of the new relation- 

 ships which an examination of them discloses, we have thought 

 it best to attempt an entire revision of the genus. We have 

 therefore collected all the synon^'my up to date, made an analyt- 

 ical key by which the species can be determined, and given a 

 detailed description of all the species now before us. To the 

 account of the Pacific Coast species, as given in the former 

 paper, we have now nothing to add, as the very extensive collec- 

 tion of them studied by us has been since mostly destroyed by 

 fire. 



We take this opportunity of acknowledging our indebtedness 

 to Dr. Jordan for the use of his library, and for other aids.

We have examined numerous specimens of this species from 

 Cedar Kej^s, Key West, and Havana, varying in size from 1^ to 

 6^ inches in length. 



Head 3^ ; depth 2| ; D. IX, 10 ; A. Ill, 8 ; scales 5-42-9. 



Body elliptical, compressed, back moderately elevated, mouth 

 small ; end of maxillary reaching slightly past vertical from front 

 margin of orbit ; exposed portion of maxillary nearly oblong, its 

 width about 2 in its length, which is from 4 to 5 in the length of 

 the head. 



Preorbital and preopercle entire. Gill-rakers small and weak, 

 T below the angle. Eye 3 in length of head, snout 3^ in head. 

 Interorbital area 3 in head. Premaxillary groove scaled in front, 

 the posterior part naked, forming a sort of pit ; longest dorsal 

 spine 1^ in head ; second anal spine shorter and stronger than 

 third, its length about 3^ in head ; ventrals reaching nearly to 

 vent ; their length If in length of head. Pectorals reaching front 

 of anal, their length about 3 in length of body. 



Color silvery, greenish, darker above; no distinct longitudinal 

 lines except in very young ; upper margin of spinous dorsal more 

 or less black. 



Dorsal and anal fins dusky, other fins pale. 



The form of this species resembles that of G. gracilis^ but the 

 bod^' is alwaj's less elongate than in the latter. The form of its 

 premaxillary groove differing from that of any other species, 

 affords the best character for distinction. 



The many specimens of this species which we have examined 

 present no marked differences or variations. They also agree 

 very well with the description and drawing of E ncinostomus gulula 

 of Poey. 



We have no doubt of the identity of gula^ argenteus, gulula and 

 homonymus.

1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 269 



Preorbital and preopercle serrate ; premaxillary groove broad, 

 narrowed posteriorly, entirely free from scales. Gill-rakers 

 short and weak, 11 below the angle; eye small, 3§ in length of 

 head ; snout 8^ in length of head. Dorsal spines rather strong

 streak along each row of scales, most conspicuous on upper part 

 of bod}^ ; fins all dusky except pectorals, which are pale ; dorsal 

 and anal blackish on their margins. A dark supraorbital spot; 

 axil dusky. 



The description of Gerres brasilianus Cuv. and Yal. is very 

 poor indeed. Dr, Jordan has examined the type, and we here 

 give a copy of his notes : " The type of this species is in very 

 bad condition, unfit for detailed description. Sides apparently 

 with dark stripes along the rows of scales. Preorbital and pre- 

 opercle serrate. Frontal groove broad, naked. Longest dorsal 

 spine .5 in bod}'. Second anal spine 5^. Anal spines 3 in number. 

 Caudal fin long. This species is allied to G. plumieri, but the 

 back is less elevated and the spines smaller than in the latter." 



The above agrees very well with our specimens from Charles- 

 ton and Havana, the latter being evidently identical with the 

 Gerres patao of Poe3\

The President, Dr. Leidt, in the chair. 



Twenty-five persons present. 



The deaths of C. J. Hoffman, a member, and of C. U. Shepherd, 

 a correspondent, were announced. 



Trapa hicornis, L. — Mr. Meehan called attention to the Ling 

 nut of the Chinese, of which a specimen on the table was four- 

 horned, as in the European species T. natans, and another with 

 three. It showed that the calj'cine horns were little more than 

 bracts, and that the European species was one more highly 

 developed than the Asiatic species. 



Formation of Croiv's Nest Branches in the Cherry Tree. — In 

 regard to fasciated branches, or as they were familiarly called 

 "crow's nests," in trees, Mr. Meehan remarked that they might 

 be classed as different species, and perhaps each species might 

 have its own peculiar law of development. In former contribu- 

 tions to the Academy, he had explained some of the phenomena 

 attendant on fasciation in trees and plants, which gave clues as 

 to their origin. In the cherry there was a species of fasciation 

 distinct from that prevailing in most trees. In a portion of the 

 mass of branches cut from the main mass, verj'^ little of an 

 abnormal character could be noted. But on the tree itself a 

 huge mass of small branches proceeding from one common 

 branch might be noted, in striking contrast with the prevailing 

 character. The specimens exhibited were from a mass of about 

 four feet in diameter. In this there were about two hundred 

 branchlets. In one of the thickest growths of a normal charac- 

 ter, only about twenty branchlets could be counted in a similar 

 space. The weight of these fasciations was so great that the 

 masses hung like pendulums from the trees. The garden cherry 

 had for more than a century been naturalized near Philadelphia, 

 and he knew of three of these fasciations, one on each wild tree, 

 within a half mile of each other. He had not seen any on culti- 

 vated trees. They had been under his observation for years. 

 The}' might be said to never flower. On one he had seen two 

 weak flowers last 3'ear. There were none this. The leaves are 

 attacked by a species of fungus, which Professor Farlow, of 

 Cambridge, had kindly worked out for him, and found to be 

 Exoascus Wilsneri, an European species closely allied to E. 

 deformans, the species well known as causing the disease called 

 the " curl " in the peach. Prof. Farlow states that the specimens 

 sent by Mr. Meehan gave him the first knowledge of the existence 

 of the species in America. 




274 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



As in the peach leaf-curl, the first leaves that push in the 

 spring are attacked, and are soon destroyed, the blistered and 

 browned leaves all falling by the first of June. New leaves, free 

 from the fungus, and weak shoots follow the attack. The absence 

 of flowers led to the discovery of the method by which the 

 fasciation is formed. In the normal condition of the cherry tree, 

 the weak shoots become fruit-bearing spurs. From these spurs 

 leaves annually appear, leaving an axillary bud, which becomes 

 the flower bud of the next season. The leaf continues healthy 

 throughout the growing season, and the parts that, morphologi- 

 cally speaking, might make a weak growth of wood, remain in 

 a kind of microcosm as sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, fed 

 by the leaf for another year. But when this leaf is injured or 

 destroyed, instead of the bud remaining quiescent, or the 

 theoretical leaves changing into floral parts in the bud, a new 

 growth of leaves and the weak shoot are produced instead. It 

 is indeed so clear when once observed that the fasciation is 

 simply the development to weak branches of what would nor- 

 mally be blossom spurs, that it was provoking to reflect that it 

 had taken so many years to discover it. 



An interesting observation was that the fungus should confine 

 itself to the fasciated mass for so many years, and show no dis- 

 position whatever to spread to any other part of the tree. In 

 practical gardening we were taught when these fungus pests 

 appeared on orchard trees it was highly important to cut oflf 

 the branches or leaves, and burn them, in order to check the 

 spread. In the absence of actual demonstration in this case, one 

 might with good reason assume that the mycelium of the para- 

 site had obtained an entrance into the tissue and propagated 

 itself continuously as the branches grew, and that a crop of 

 spores in myriads must be produced annually. Only in rare 

 instances were the circumstances favorable to their germination. 

 The careful cutting away and burning of a few thousand spores 

 would be a matter of small importance in compaiison with the 

 immense number that must escape the effort of the cultivator for 

 their destruction. Safety lies evidently rather in the diflflculty 

 these minute bodies experience in finding the exact conditions 

 necessary for their growth and development, than from the 

 destruction of the germs themselves. 



Distribution of Modiola tulipa. — Mr. John Ford reported the 

 finding by him of a half-grown specimen of Modiola tulipa Lam., 

 near Cape May, N. J., on the 16th ult. As the species is essen- 

 tially a southern one, it was at first supposed that the specimen 

 had been carried north on the bottom of a vessel, or in some 

 other artificial manner. The discovery two weeks later, by Mr. 

 Ford, of a dozen or more adult specimens, at Anglesea, ten 

 miles further north, seems to prove that the species has entered 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 275 



upon its new conditions in large numbers, and with the purpose 

 of making its new home a permanent one. 



There is no record of the species having been found north of 

 South Carolina before. 



Toxodon and other Remains from Nicaragua, C. A. — Prof. 

 Leid^ directed attention to some fossils, and remarked that they 

 were part of a collection which he had been invited to examine 

 by Mrs. Dr. B. F. Guerrero, now residing in this city. The collec- 

 tion was obtained from the northern part of Nicaragua, but 

 nothing further had been learned about it. It mostly consisted 

 of uncharacteristic fragments of bones, but among them were 

 many interesting specimens referable to Megatherium, Elephant, 

 Mastodon, Horse, Ox, Toxodon, and Capybara. The association 

 of these animals is another illustration of the extension of the 

 early South American quaternary fauna into North America. 

 Among tlie remains of Megatherium there is the greater part of 

 the distal extremity of a femur and a fragment of the mandible 

 with two teeth. Of the Elephant there is a portion of a molar 

 tooth. Of the Mastodon there is a molar tooth and portions of 

 several others apparently of the M. andium. Of the Horse there are 

 two upper molar teeth, with no well-marked difference distinguish- 

 ing them from those of ordinary varieties of the Domestic Horse. 

 Perhaps they may pertain to one or other of the species indicated 

 by Prof. Owen with the names of Equus curvidens or E. tau. Of 

 the Ox, the collection contains several horn-cores of different 

 sizes ; one, double the size of that of the Domestic Ox. 



The Capybara is indicated by a fragment of the left ramus of 

 a mandible with the first molar alveolns containing the greater 

 part of the tooth. The specimen conforms to the corresponding 

 portion of the jaw of tlie living Capybara, but indicates a con- 

 siderably larger and more robust animal. Considering the dif- 

 ference in size and age of the fossil, it was 

 probably a different species from the Capy- 

 bara, and regarding it as such he proposes 

 for it the name of Eydrochoerus robustua. 

 The first molar tooth complete would have 

 the appearance represented in figure 1, and, 

 ^- except in size, does not differ from that of 



the Capybara. Comparative measurements of the fossil are as 

 follows : — 



Depth of mandible at first molar, 

 Length of first molar. 

 Fore and aft diameter, 

 Transverse diameter of last dental 



plate, ..... 

 Diameter of incisive alveolus, . 



Dr. Lund, in his Fossil Fauna of Brazil (An, Sc. Nat., 1839, 




276 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



214) refers to remains of HydrocJioerus, which he refers to two 

 species, one as JS. affine Capybarse, not different from the living 

 Capybara, and another which he calls H. sulcidens^ of a size inter- 

 mediate to the latter and the Tapir, and having the incisors 

 deeply grooved in front. He remarks the former differs in having 

 the incisors smooth in front as in the living species, which saying 

 is obscure, for in the living Capybara the incisors are con- 

 spicuously grooved in front. 



Prof. Owen (Voyage of the Beagle 110), speaks of a decom- 

 posed molar tooth of Hydrochoerus, found with remains of Mega- 

 therium,- Toxodon, etc., by Mr. Darwin at Bahia Blanca, S. A. 

 He remarks that the fossil differs from the corresponding tooth 

 of the Capybara, in the greater relative breadth of the component 

 laminae. 



Prof. Gervais (Rech. Mam. Fos. de I'Amerique Meredionale, 

 1855, 12), describes remains of Hydrochoerus, found with those 

 of Megatherium, Toxodon, etc., at Tarija, Bolivia. Thej^ con- 

 sisted of portions of upper jaws, which are regarded as pertaining 

 to a species but little different in size and in the form of the teeth 

 from the recent Capybara. They are referred to the H. a finis 

 Gapyharse of Dr. Lund. A specimen of a maxilla with the last 

 two molar teeth, figured in Plate xiii, fig. 3, of the work, indicates 

 a more robust animal than the living Capybara, and the last 

 molar tooth is composed of fourteen plates, a greater number 

 than exists in the recent animal. In four skulls of the latter he 

 found the last upper molar to have tweh'e plates, while in the fossil 

 described by Gervais there are fourteen plates. Comparative 

 measurements of the latter fossil with the recent animal are as 

 follows : — 



Capj'bara. Tarija fossil. 

 Last molar, fore and aft diameter, 33 to 34 mm. 50 mm. 

 Last molar, transverse diameter, 12 to 13 " 20 " 

 Penultimate molar, fore and aft, 9 to 10 " 14 " 



He thought it probable that the remains of Hydrochoerus, 

 referred by Lund and Gervais to H. afpnis Gapyharse, and those 

 mentioned b}' Owen, as above noted, probably also belong to the 

 species he had named E. robustus. He formerly described some 

 remains of Hydrochoerus, which were found in association with 

 those of MegatherixLin, etc., in the Ashley Phosphate Beds of 

 South Carolina (Post-pleiocene Fossils of South Carolina, 1860, 

 112, pi. xxi, figs. 3-6). These consist of teeth, which agree in 

 size with those of the recent Capybara, and were referred to a 

 probably extinct species, with the name of H. u^sopi. 



The most interesting fossils of the collection are those of Toxo- 

 don,as being evidence of the former existence of this remarkable 

 animal in North America. The best preserved and best marked 

 specimens consist of a nearly complete lower molar tooth, and 

 two portions of a lower incisor. These in their form and size best 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 277 



agree with the corresponding teeth of Toxodon Burmeisteri, 

 described and figured by Dr. Burmeister, in the Annals of the 

 Museum of Buenos Aires, 1869, 256, pi. xi. 



The molar tooth is the penultimate of the left side. Its length, 



when complete, has approxi- 

 mated five inches, and it mea- 

 sures 43 mm. fore and aft, and 

 18 mm. transversely at its fore 

 part. An outline of the tritu- 

 rating surface is represented in 

 figure 2. Enamel invests the 

 outer surface extending about half way round the corners in front 

 and behind. On the inner surface enamel invests the middle 

 extending furthest behind. The inner angles of the tooth are 

 both destitute of enamel. The outer enamel layer forms a single 

 inflection about the anterior third of tlie tooth ; the inner enamel 

 layer forms two inflections nearly equidistant behind the position 

 of the outer one ; the posterior inflection being the deepest. 



The incisor, apparently the second lower of the right side, is 

 broken into two about the middle, and when complete has been 

 over six inches long. The transverse section, as seen in figure 3, 



viewed from below, is triangular, with 

 the apex directed outward, and the 

 base inward or mesially. The front 

 surface is transversely convex, and 

 the back surface in the same direction 

 concave. The inner surface, extending 

 around the corners, further in front 

 than behind, is destitute of enamel. 

 The triturating surface is worn away in a slope from the outer 

 border inward and backward. The measurement of the section 

 in front and behind is 3Y mm., and internall}- fore and aft 23 mm.

On the Expansion of the Crystalline lens. — Dr. Benjamin Sharp 

 remarked that it is well known that accommodation in the e^'e, 

 for distance, is effected by the contraction of the ciliary muscle, 

 drawing on the point of attachment of the capsular ligament of 

 the lens, the lens widening its optical axis as soon as the tension 




2*78 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



of the ligament is released. The lens is flattened, or its optical 

 axis is shortened, as soon as the ciliary muscle is relaxed ; the 

 ligament being drawn upon by the elasticity of the sclera, and 

 perhaps it is somewhat aided by the intraocular pressure. Dr. 

 Sharp stated that as far as he knew the mechanism of the 

 " lenticular expansion " had not been described. This action is 

 easily seen on turning to the development of the lens. The 

 lens is formed by an invagination of the external ectoderm soon 

 closing, and as a result we have a spherical vesicle, soon enclosed 

 in the mouth of the secondary optic vesicle. When this has 

 taken place, the posterior wall of the lens-vesicle thickens, that 

 is, the posterior cells commence to elongate, and grow toward 

 the anterior wall of the vesicle, the cells of which remain, 

 generally speaking, of the same size, and later form the so-called 

 epithelium of the lens. Keeping this structure in view, we see 

 that when pressure is brought to bear on the lens, these elongated 

 cells of the posterior wall are compressed in their longitudinal 

 axis, so that as soon as the pressure is removed, the}'^ simply 

 straighten out. This will also account for the fact, that the 

 anterior face of the lens is the only portion that moves in the 

 act of accommodation for distance. In the adult lens this 

 structure is to a certain extent lost, and the lens is generally 

 described as being made iip of laj^ers concentrically arranged. 

 This is true, but the embryonic " impression " still remains. If 

 w^e supposed that the lens were made up of layers concentrically 

 arranged and so formed, when the capsular ligament " slacked 

 np " the tendency of the lens would be to shorten its optical 

 axis instead of lengthening it. 



The Opal Mines of Que?^etaro, Mexico. — Dr. A. E. Foote 

 remarked that the locality referred to is particularly interesting 

 as being the only one in North America that is being worked 

 solel}^ for the production of gems. ^ 



The opals of Mexico have been celebrated since 1820, when 

 Karsten and Del Rio referred to the opals of Zimapan and that 

 neio-hborhood as being in many respects equal and in some 

 respects superior to the Hungarian. There are quite a number 

 of fine localities from which considerable quantities have been 

 exported to Europe, so that among the lovers of the beautiful, 

 Mexico is as well known for its brilliant opals as for the soft and 

 exquisite tints of the tecali or Mexican onyx. 



As in the case of diamonds from Brazil and Africa, there is a 

 jeweler's prejudice against the new locality, and they are con- 

 sidered even more unlucky and liable to break than those of 

 Hungar3\ I have, however, seen in the possession of Senor 

 Cosio magnificent specimens that had been taken out over ten 

 years, and were without a flaw. 



The locality in Queretaro is the only one in Mexico that is 

 being worked to any extent now. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 279 



The principal mines are on the hacienda of Esperanza, where 

 the opal was discovered, by a servant, ten years ago. No mines 

 were taken up until 1870, when Dr. Jose Maria Siurob located 

 the mine of Santa Maria Iris. The fine specimens secured during 

 the next few years created so much excitement that a large 

 number of mines were located, most of which are now abandoned. 

 The district is quite extensive, having been traced over a region 

 about twenty leagues long by thirty-one leagues wide. At 

 Ciervo, fourteen leagues from Esperanza, the opal is quite 

 abundant, though none of the precious variety of good quality 

 has been found. 



The mines of Esperanza can only be reached on horseback, 

 and the ride from Queretaro is a very hard one. San Juan del 

 Rio, said to be the nearest large town where one can get accom- 

 modations for the night, is ten leagues to the S, E. 



Leaving the Mexican Central Railroad aijd crossing a rich 

 alluvial plain, covered with fields of corn and the so-called cen- 

 tury plant, surrounded by fences of Cereus giganteus, we came 

 to the foot hills. Here at once abundant evidences of volcanic 

 action were seen. Round nodules of obsidian, large masses of 

 agate, milk opal, and other siliceous pi'oducts, were mixed with 

 the cacti on every side. The rough trail soon led into the dry 

 bed of a barranca, where porphyritic trachyte carryino- the 

 common A'arieties of opal were quite abundant ; the trend of 

 these porphyritic banks was from S. E. to N. W. The color of 

 the rock is reddish gray. As the barranca terminated in a 

 narrow valley, on the mountains on each side were seen the red 

 dumps standing out conspicuously upon the gray surface. 



Of the mines that he visited only one, the Jurado, was being 

 worked. The deposits of opal-bearing trachyte are so irreo-ular 

 that the mines are soon exhausted. 



The Jurado is an immense excavation about 150 feet deep 

 several hundred feet long, and about 100 feet wide. At the' 

 bottom, the porphyritic rock seemed to be thoroughly impreo-. 

 nated with hydrated silica, even occasionally beino- converted 

 into common opal. 



The general appearance of the rock furnishes a verv oood clue 

 to the character of the opals that it may contain. Thus if the 

 rock is less red in color and close and compact in texture fire 

 opals and related forms abound, while if the rock is deep red in 

 color or clayey and pockety, the Hungarian, harlequin, and milky 

 opals are much more abundant. 



There is no locality of which he had ever heard where such 

 an extraordinary variety of opals can be found in a single 

 matrix. The same small piece of rock will show fire opal fire 

 opal showing green and blue reflections, the Hungarian, harlequin 

 girasol, hyalite, milk, and almost every variet3\ The harlequins' 

 showing a mosaic of brilliant minute spangles of color in a 

 milky base, vie with the broad sheets of dazzling blue red and

green. Perhaps, like Ruskin, we should give the palm to the 

 "Milky opals that gleam and shine like sullen fires in a pallid 

 mist."! 



Vitality of Mollusca. — Prof. Heilprin called attention to a 

 remarkable case of vitality among certain members of the fauna 

 of the New Jersey coast. Specimens of Nassa obsoleta collected 

 by Miss Emma Walter, at Atlantic City just one year ago, and 

 retained dry during the entire year of their accidental captivity, 

 were stated to be still alive, although subjected for several months 

 to the abnormal temperature occasioned b\^ proximit^^ to a heated 

 wall surface. This, the speaker contended, was perhaps the most 

 extraordinary instance of vitality known among the marine mol- 

 lusca, although among the terrestrial and freshwater forms, 

 especially among those which undergo a partial hibernation, 

 longer periods of semi-adaptation to imposed conditions have 

 been noted. Instances of such survivals were cited by the speaker 

 and Prof. Leid3\

Note on Quercus dentata. — Mr. Thomas Meehan exhibited 

 specimens of Quercus dentata with female flowers, from a speci- 

 men raised from an acorn received from Japan ten years ago. It 

 is of very rapid growth, being now eighteen feet high, and six 

 inches in circumference. So recently as the issue of the volume 

 of De Candolle^s Prodromus, it was noted that the fruit was un- 

 known. Some account of these female flowers might have an 

 interest. Like our annual fruited oaks the flowers appear at the 

 end of the young growth, in pairs on peduncles about half an

 minute bright white rhombohedrons showing the basal planes ; these have 

 been examined by Prof. E. S. Dana, who pronounces tliem alunite. Well

inch long, the peduncles of course springing from the axils of the 

 upper leaves. Early in June a second growth occurs, on which 



are also female flowers. 

 On many of the stronger 

 a third growth is made 

 before autumn. The sev- 

 eral growths during the 

 season on this tree, have 

 no doubt had much to do 

 with its great size in so 

 short a time. The in- 

 volucre is a mass of loose 

 scales, in the centre of 

 which the four blackish 

 lio-ulate stigmas are seen. 

 Bisecting the flower verti- 

 cally'^, the usually minute 

 cah'x segments, immediatel}' beneath the stigmas are represented 

 here by numerous brown scale-like hairs, which simulate the scales 

 of the involucre, and are at the apex of a slender stipe or beak 

 four lines long, that seems to spring from the true ovarium as if it 

 were a true st3'le, and the real pistils represent a four-cleft stigma 

 at the apex. He did not remember any American species that 

 had so long a beak in this early stage of growth, though there 

 were some species that he had not had an opportunit}^ of dis- 

 secting. From those that he had had the opportunity of exam- 

 ining the ditferences in this feature were striking, and the 

 character could certainly be made more useful than it had been 

 in enabling us to discriminate species in this very difficult genus. 

 A horizontal section of the ovarium shows it to be four-celled, 

 with each cell two-ovuled.

Mineralogical Notes. — Composition of Stromeyerite. — Professor 

 George A. Kcenig placed on record the identification of Stro- 

 meyerite from Zacatecas, Mexico. At this locality the miners 

 designate the various silver minerals by their colors as black 

 silver, red silver, green silver, and blue silver. Under the 

 latter name — plata azul — several minerals are undoubtedl}' com- 

 prehended, but probably the most prevalent is the mineral 

 here identified as Stromeyerite. One large specimen is com-

posed of numerous prismatic crystals, the terminations broken 

 off — sitting on well-cr3'stallized quartz, and from several smaller 

 specimens it would appear that quartz is the ordinary com- 

 panion of Stromeyerite at Zacatecas, whilst the other silver 

 minerals — Proustite, Polybasite, Stephanite, Argentite — are moi'e 

 coramonl}^ associated with Calcite. The faces of the crystals are 

 rough, not admitting close measurements ; the prismatic angle is 

 near 120°-119°. The mineral has no cleavage. Its fracture is 

 uneven to flat subchonchoidal and very splintery. The lustre 

 is brilliantly metallic and the color iron-gray with a strong bluish 

 purple admixture. The color of the powder is nearly the same. 

 It is not sectile, but mild, and has a hardness of 3, 5. 



Spec, gravity = 6'2303, made upon 1"623 grams of fragments 

 from several crystals. Before the blowpipe it melts verj' readily 

 to a globule, emitting sulfurdioxide, and changing to a gray 

 globule of silver-copper. Gives no sublimate on charcoal, nor 

 in open or closed tube, and dissolves in nitric acid to a blue solu- 

 tion, in which h3^drochloric acid precipitates flocculent silver 

 chloride. 



A preliminary analj^sis made with a fragment from one crystal 

 (02346 gram) gave the result I ; a second analysis made upon 

 the mixed fragments used in the determination of specific gravity 

 (0'5 gr.) gave the result II. 



I. AgCl = 0-1615 ; Cu,S = 00958 ; BaSO, = 0-2837. 

 II. AgCl = 0-2509; Cu.S = 02105 ; BaSO, = 0-5758. 



From this we calculate : 



Insoluble 



Ag 



Cu 



S 



100-97 99-94 



Analysis having been made with twice the quantity of sub- 

 stance and with greater care, deserves alone to be taken as basis 

 for the atomic ratio. Dividing the percentages by the atomic 

 weights, we obtain : 



Ag : Cu : S = 0-4661 : 0-5322 : 0-4975 

 Ag+ Cu : S = 0-9983 : 0-4975 

 = 2-007 : 1 

 Hence, 47 Ag^S + 53 Cu,S 



It is seen that Ag and Cu are not exactly in the ratio 1:1, 

 but very near. Undoubted Stromeyerite has been described 

 heretofore only from two localities, Schlangenberg, in Siberia, 

 and Rudelstadt, in Silesia, and from the latter place only in 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 283 



cr^'stals. The anal^yses of the mineral from these places do not 

 give the ratio of 1 : 1 for Ag and Cu either, but a little closer than 

 the present locality of Zacatecas. Since Ag,,S and Cu.^S may 

 replace each other isomorphically in all proportions without 

 question, we may look upon such a ratio as Stromeyerite demands, 

 1 : 1 , as quite an exception, owing no doubt to peculiar condi- 

 tions present at the time of crystallization. 



The material for this investigation was obtained from Dr. A. E. 

 Foote, who collected it during his recent visit to Zacatecas and 

 other mineral localities in Mexico.

NOTES ON THE PASPALI OF LE CONTE'S MONOGRAPH. 

 BY GEORGE VASEY. 



The monograph of U. S. species of the genus Faspalum, by 

 Capt. (since Major) Le Conte, was published in the Journal de 

 Physique, Paris, vol. 91 (1820). It contains descriptions of 

 eighteen species. 



Through the kindness of Mr. J. H. Redfield, all the Lecontean 

 specimens of Faspalum in the Herbarium of the Philadelphia 

 Academy of Natural Sciences, have been placed in my hands for 

 examination, and I have given them as careful a revision as I find 

 possible. The result is expressed in the following notes. I have to 

 premise that autograph specimens of some of these species are 

 wanting, and of some others are mixed in the sheet with other 

 species, making it doubtful which was the typical plant. But in 

 most cases the specimens and descriptions enable us satis factor il}^ 

 to determine the species indicated. 



1. Paspalum prsecox, Walter. 



The specimen to which Le Conte's ticket is attached is a form 

 of P. laeve, Mich., not answering, however, to all the characters 

 given, as the sheaths and leaves are not " w7osm2mMs" and the 

 number of spikes is four instead of three. In the same sheet, 

 however, is another specimen which has hairy leaves and sheaths. 

 Le Conte evidently thought he was describing the plant of Walter, 

 but the description does not answer for the plant which is now 

 accepted as the F. prsecox of Walter, nor does it agree with the 

 description either of Michaux or Elliott. 



2. P. setaceum, Michx. 



The ticket bearing this name is in a sheet with another bearing 

 the name of the next species, and the plants are all the common 

 erect hairy form of F. setaceum, Michx., except one specimen, 

 ticketed F. ciliatifolium, from Georgia, and marked " Baldwin." 

 Mr. Le Conte's description answers well to the commonlj^ ac- 

 cepted plant of Michaux, and he gives after his description this 

 reference, " P. setaceum et dehile Michaux, Nova Cesarea ad 

 Floridam," with the mark O for annual, which latter point is 

 open to doubt. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 285 



3. P. ciliatifolium, Michx. 



As above stated, the ticket for this is in the same sheet with 

 the preceding, and if it has not been changed, must apply to the 

 same plant, as the description does not at all apply to the smooth 

 long-leaved specimen of P. ciliatifolium from Georgia. Some of 

 the specimens have " spica unica," and some have " spicis 1 sive 

 2," and some with the usual lateral peduncled ones. 



4. P. longepedunculatum, Le Conte. 



The specimen to which this name is attached is commonly 

 referred to P. setaceum, Michx,, but is a different form from Nos. 

 2 and 3, more like the southern P. ciliatifolium, but having the 

 leaves shorter and narrower. There are several long peduncled 

 lateral spikes which are not mentioned in the description, the 

 name being based on the " very long peduncled common spike." 

 In Herb. Scribner is a specimen, collected by Mr. Isaac Burk, on 

 the ballast grounds of Philadelphia, which is almost exactly like 

 the Le Contean one, and if P. ciliatifolium is considered a species 

 this might be called variety brevifolia. At the close of his de- 

 scription Le Conte says " P. debile, Muhl. Gram," 



5. P. Floridanum, Michx. 



There ai-e two tickets with this name, one of which is attached 

 to a specimen of P. racemulosum, Nutt,, which specimen does not 

 agree with Le Conte's description ; the other is attached to a 

 much smaller plant, ver}^ well answering the description of Le 

 Conte but not of Michaux, The specimen is not different appar- 

 ently- from the one to which Le Conte's ticket " P, prsecox " is 

 attached, which we take to be Paspalum Iseve, Michx., the short 

 broad-leaved form which is perhaps the typical one. 



In Herb. Torrey is a specimen of Paspalum Floridanum with a 

 note, "not of Le Conte, which is P. Iseve. Ell. i, p. 106, non 

 Michx, ? " We see from this note not only that Dr. Torrey 

 referred Le Conte's P. Floridanum to P. laeve, Ell,, but also that 

 he had doubt if Elliott's plant was the same as Michaux's. 



6. p. laeve, Michx. 



Le Conte's ticket with this name is loose in a sheet with the 

 preceding, the three specimens being apparently all alike except 

 as to the pubescence of the leaves. There is also in another sheet 

 a specimen with the ticket attached, which specimen is the form 




286 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



of P. Iseve, with long, smooth leaves, not as No. 6 is described 

 with " foliis latiusculis, brevibus." 



7. P. difforme, Le Conte. 



The name as printed is " cliflbrme," evidently a typographical 

 error. The specimen is intermediate between P. laeve and P. 

 Floridanum, and diflferent from either. Le Conte says, " Refert 

 P. Floridanum sed spicis erectis, glumisque majoribus facile dis- 

 tinguitur." This comparison was evidently made with his No. 5, 

 which was not the P. Floridanum, Mx. He also refers Paspalum 

 No. 7 of Muhlenberg's Gram, to this plant, but the description is 

 too obscure to be of any value. We have specimens in the XJ. S. 

 Herbarium from N. C, and from Florida, which are apparently 

 the same as Le Conte's plant. They have been referred to P. 

 Floridanum, but are clearly different in the smaller size of the 

 plant, in the shorter spikes, and in the much shorter leaves. We 

 have the same plant, also, from Dr. Charles Mohr, Mobile, Ala., 

 who noted that it differed from the P. Floridanum. He says P. 

 Floridanum blooms from the middle of June to the middle of 

 July, while the other kind begins to flower six or eight weeks 

 later. Altogether it seems that for these specimens Le Conte's 

 name should be recognized and added to our list. 



8. P. undulosuni', Le Conte. 



The specimen over this name is apparently a form of P. laeve, 

 Michx., with wider and smoother leaves, more numerous and 

 shorter spikes than in the common form. I have seen no other 

 specimens quite matching it, and it may very well be called P. 

 laeve, variety undulosum. The undulate margin of the leaves is 

 also shared by other species. Schultes subsequently published 

 this as P. Leconteanum (Mant. 2, 168), probably because Le 

 Conte's name was too much like P. undulatum, Poir. 



9. P. latifolium, Le Conte. 



The specimen with this name looks like a very exuberant P. 

 ciliatifolium, with equally small spikelets, but in three or four 

 series. The leaves are about an inch wide, and eight to ten 

 inches long. I have seen no other such specimens, but the 

 general appearance and habit is that of P. ciliatifolium, of which 

 it is probably a luxuriant form.

10. P. virgatum, Walt. 



The ticket bearing tliis name is loose in a sheet which contains 

 two specimens of P. plicatulum, Michx., and two specimens of 

 F. prsecox, Walt., one of which is ticketed, " Hei'b. Schw., P. pli- 

 catulum, Georgia, Hermann." The description seems to refer to 

 what we call P. prsecox, Walt., " spicis 5-6, alternis, erectis, 

 glumis biseriatis, rachi latiuscula, non flexuosa, deutibus bifloris." 

 Le Conte apparently mistook his No. 1 for P. praecox, Walt., and 

 this for P. virgatum, Walt. The true P. virgatum, Walt., is prob- 

 ably P. purpurascens, Ell. Le Conte adds to his description this 

 note," Calicis valvulae omnium paspalorum, cuve semina matures- 

 cent juxta margines trans versse plicatas fiunt." If this means that 

 the glumes of all Paspalums when mature have transverse plica- 

 tions such as mark the P. plicatulum, Michx., it is a great jcrror. 



11. P. angustifolium, Le Conte. 



The specimen bearing this name is evidently one of the forms 

 commonly called P. laeve, Michx., having long, narrow and smooth 

 leaves, and three slender spikes three to four inches long. It is 

 quite different from No. 5, which represents a form with much 

 shorter and wider leaves, and which is possibly the tjq^ical plant, 

 as Michaux says " foliis breviusculis." No subsequent writer 

 except Elliott, however, quotes these words of Michaux. Gray says 

 " the pretty large and long leaves ;" Chapman says " leaves and 

 sheaths smooth or the latter hairy ;" Elliott quotes Michaux's 

 words, " leaves short," but does not recognize the plant. It is, 

 therefore, difficult to say precisely what was Michaux's tj'pe, and 

 some botanists will prefer to consider this species of Le Conte as 

 a distinct one. Otherwise, it may be distinguished as variety 

 angicstifolium. 



12. P. graoile, Le Con^e. 



The two specimens bearing this name, one ticket marked " Pas- 

 palum gracile mihi, P. laeve, Schweinitz," the other " Paspalum 

 tenue, Kth., P. gracile, Le Conte, ' Durand,'" are clearly what 

 is commonly understood as P. plicatulum, Michx., or P. undula- 

 tum, Poir. Kunth published P. tenue, evidently based either on 

 Le Conte's specimens or on the description to which he refers. If 

 Kunth saw the specimens, and they were the same as these in the 

 Herb, Acad. Phil., it is not easy to understand how he should 

 make a new species of them, unless, as maybe the fact, Michaux's 

 plant is the P. purpurascens^ Elliott, in which case indeed another 




288 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



name would be needed for Le Conte's plant, and as the name P. 

 gracile had been earlier appropriated by Rudge for a S. American 

 plant, Kunth distinguished this by the name of P. tenue. An 

 inspection of the Le Contean specimens in the Herb. Mus. Paris 

 will probably settle this question, Kunth, however, refers 

 Michaux's P. plicatulum not only to P. purpurasceiis, Ell,, but 

 also to P. undulatum, Poir, as if Michaux had confused two 

 species, which is very likely to be the case. On the other hand, 

 if Kunth saw Le Conte's specimens, and they were like these of 

 the Herb. Acad, Phila,, he should have recognized them as the 

 P. undulatum, Poir. 



Le Conte, at the end of his description of this species, says, 

 " Muhlenberg Gram, sub Paspalo,No. 8," with the description of 

 which 'Le Conte's does not agree. Furthermore, there is in Herb. 

 Torrey a specimen of Paspalum setaceum, Michx,, which is also 

 referred to " Pasp. No. 8, Muhl. Gram.," and which agrees suffi- 

 ciently well with the description. 



13, p. altissimum, Le Conte. 



The single specimen to which this name is attached is evidently 

 what is commonly called P. Floridanum, Michx., for which, 

 according to Kunth, the earlier name of P. macrospermum, 

 Flugge, must be adopted. Le Conte's specimen has only two 

 spikes, although his description says " spicis 4-5." The species, 

 however, or some forms of it, often have 4 to 5 spikes. One 

 form has pubescent leaves or sheathes, and one form is quite 

 glabrous. Le Conte mistook his No. 5 for P. Floridanum, Michx. 



14, P. confertum, Le Conte. 



The specimen to which this name is attached is evidently P. 

 purpurascens, Ell. Mr. Durand recognized this and attached a 

 ticket marked " resembling P. purpurascens, and I believe iden- 

 tical, E, D," On the same sheet is another specimen of the same 

 species, ticketed "P, purpurascens, Ell,, Georgia, Dr. Baldwin." 

 Kunth gives both P. purpurascens, Ell,, and P. confertum^ 

 Le Conte, as if they were distinct plants. Probably he did not 

 see Le Conte's specimens. 



15, P. distichum, Linn, 



I find no specimens with a ticket in Le Conte's writing, but 

 there are in a sheet marked P, distichum, specimens noted as 

 coming from Le Conte, and others, Georgia, Baldwin. The 




1886.] . NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 289 



description of Le Conte seems to refer to P. distichum, Linn., 

 but at the end be gives, as a S3'nonym, Digitaria paspalodes^ 

 Michx., which is understood b}^ Elliott and by Dr. Chapman as 

 appl3'ing to Paspaluin Digitaria, Poir, which seems not to have 

 been known to Le Conte, unless he agreed with Elliott in referring 

 it to the genus Milium^ in which case it woiild not appear in a 

 revision of Paspalum. 



16. P. tristachyum, Le Conte. 



The specimen bearing this name is apparently a three-spiked 

 form of P. vaginatum., Swz. The description also conforms to 

 that species, and Mr. Le Conte adds the remark, " Refert prius 

 sed primo obtuto facile distinguitur, foliis angustis glaberrimus. 

 Habitat in subsalsis, Georgia." 



Mr. Bentham considers P. vaginatuvi, Swz., as synonymous with 

 P. distichum, Linn., but the two are well defined by Le Conte, 

 and I think are clearly distinct, although with poor or imperfect 

 specimens it is not always easy to discriminate. Although this 

 species commonly has but two spikes, it sometimes occurs with 

 three. 



17. P. membranaceum, Walt. 



I find no specimen of this species with Le Conte's ticket, but 

 from the description, and the reference to P. vaginatum, Ell., il 

 is pretty clearly the P. Walterianum, Schultes. 



18. P. natans, Le Conte. 



I find no specimen with Le Conte's ticket, but from the descrip- 

 tion and reference to P. mucronatum, Muhl., and the additional 

 notes, it can hardly be doubted that this is the P.fluitans^ Walt. 

 (Ceresia fluitans, Ell,). 



Mr. Le Conte undoubtedly observed and collected many of the 

 species of Paspalum in Georgia, where he spent many 3^ears of 

 his early life ; he was also acquainted with Baldwin and Elliott. 

 The latter had already published the earlier numbers of his 

 " Sketch of the Botany of S. Carolina " before the appearance of 

 Le Conte's Monograph, and Elliott is referred to in Le Conte's 

 Paspalum, No. 1*7. Reference is several times made to Pursh 

 and Muhlenberg, whose works had been published but a short 

 time. Michaux described seven species of Paspalum, all of 

 which are referred to by Le Conte. Muhlenberg describes ten 

 species, Including two to which he gave numbers without specific 




290 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



names, and to these Le Conte makes reference, No. 1 under bis 

 P. difforme, and No. 8 under his P. gracile, but a comparison of 

 tbe descriptions does not afford much satisfaction. Elliott 

 described eleven species of Paspalum, or thirteen, if we include 

 his Milium paspalodes and Ceresia fiuitans. The monograph of 

 Le Conte enumerates eighteen species, of which four or five had 

 not been previously described and may be counted new species 

 or varieties. All these are indigenous to the Atlantic States ; 

 the additional ones of the Southwest had not, probably, been 

 collected at the time of this monograph.

On Tor'sion in the HolJyliocIc^ with sovie observations on cross- 

 fertilization. — Mr. Meehan observed that the torsion of the 

 opening flowers of the hollyhock was towards the sun ; but after 

 the expanded flower had become fertilized, and the flower closed 

 for fading, the torsion was in the contrary direction. The same 

 thing occurred in Hibiscus rosa-sinensis. He had no opportunity 

 to this date to note the facts in other Malvacex.^ As a general 

 rule the spiral revolutions of plants are uniform through every 

 stage of growth, at least this is the general teaching of botanists. 

 Prof. Goodale notes (" Bot. Text Book," vol. ii, p. 407), that in 

 the Tropics, some plants twine indifferently from right to left. 

 If we had given thought to the manner in which secund inflores- 

 cence is arranged, we might have seen that the torsion is anything 

 but uniform throughout the same plant, for a secund raceme 

 could only be formed by the twisting of each succeeding flower 

 in an opposite direction. This alternation of convolution is 

 indeed necessary in a branch with a horizontal direction in order 

 that each flower along the spiral should assume an erect attitude. 

 When a horizontal or geotropic branch assumed an upright posi- 

 tion, the inflorescence was necessarily secund. One might almost 

 infer that secund inflorescence had its origin in geotropic plants 

 which had retained the power of alternate torsion after assuming 

 the erect form. So little is known of the laws operating in 

 connection with the turning habits of plants and flowers, that 

 every fact is of value, and this one relating to the reversal of the 

 direction in these two malvaceous jjlants, and probably in others 

 of the same order, must be worth placing on record. 



Mr. Meehan further noted that the hollyhock, notwithstanding 

 its gaudy coloring and general attractions to insects, is a self- 

 fertilizer, and that insects rather aided than otherwise in this 



1 The author has since noted that in Palava flexuosa the flower twists 

 also in the direction of the sun, and in the contrary direction when fading, 

 but in Callirhosa involucrata the flower is twisted against tlie sun, when 

 fading as when opening. 




292 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



self-fertilization. The flower is strongly proterandrous. The 

 stamens are mature and shed their pollen co-incident with the 

 expansion of the corolla. The fasciculus of pistils at this time, 

 have not reached half their growth, and is completely covered 

 by the stamens, which form a dense mass in the centre of the 

 flower. During the day, and the one succeeding, humble and 

 honey bees make this crown of stamens their resting-place. 

 During these two da^-s the pistils have not yet thrust their 

 stigmas above the stamens that crown them. If now we cut a 

 flower through longitudinally, we shall find that a very large 

 quantity of pollen has fallen down within the bundle of pistils — 

 this gathering of pollen being evidently aided by the feet of 

 insects that made a landing-place of the staminal crown. Up 

 to this time, however, the pistils not having come to maturity, 

 the pollen thrust in among them would have no physiological 

 significance. But on the morning of the third day, the pistils 

 protrude and are in receptive condition, and they bring up with 

 them large quantities of pollen, so completely covering the 

 surface of each pistil that it would seem almost impossible for 

 any grains of foreign pollen to find any lodgment for efi'ective 

 use ; and though a grain of foreign pollen should get an oppor- 

 tunity to perform its function, it must be evident that the 

 flower's own pollen has the earliest opportunities for usefulness, 

 and must in almost every case be the fertilizing agent. An 

 interesting note may be here recorded in reference to the 

 power of own-pollen over fertility. Mr. Darwin in his " Cross- 

 and Self-Fertilization," page 141, referring to his single experi- 

 ment among malvaceous plants. Hibiscus Af7'icanus, found a 

 larger number of crossed flowers produced capsules than among 

 the self-fertilizing ones ; but in the case of these evidently self- 

 fertilized flowers, no one seemed to fail in producing seed — 

 every pistil, indeed, producing a perfectly fertile carpel. At the 

 end of the third day the flowers closed, twisting in the opposite 

 direction, as alread}^ noted. 



On Projection, of Pollen in the Floweis of Indigofe7^a. — Exhib- 

 iting some flowers of Indigofera Dosua, Mr. Meehan remarked 

 that the peculiar bending back of the carina in the flowers 

 of Indigofera has been long known. Referring to the whole 

 genus, Don, in the General History of Dichlamydeous Plants, 

 published in 1837, says, " Keel furnished with a subulate spur on 

 both sides, at length usuall3' bending back elastically." In 1863 

 Decandolle and Treviranus, in Botanische Zeitung, page 3, refer 

 to this bending back of the keel and say it is not an elastic 

 motion, but simply a falling down on the full development of the 

 flower; and the latter remarks, as quoted by Henslow, that " all 

 these movements occur in the natural development of the parts, 

 and only after self-fecundation takes place." Dr. Hildebrand, in 

 the same magazine for 1866, seems to admit that finally the keel 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 293 



will fall (low from sheer maturity, but thinks insects in the search 

 for honey may anticipate this natural development. The Rev. 

 Geo. Henslow, in the ix vol. (1868) of the Journal of the Lin- 

 naean Society^ Pf-ge 357, commenting on these statements, suggests 

 that though self-impregnation may be possible, the jerkings of the 

 stamens when the carina falls away, causes the pollen to scatter 

 over the insects, which then carry the pollen to other flowers. In 

 the X vol. (1869), p. 468, he notes that when the carina is liberated 

 it falls back with a jerk, as noted by Don, and that the stamens 

 fly up and closely press the vexillum. But no opportunity oc- 

 curred to him of observing what insects eflfected this process 

 which he accomplished artificially. In Mr. Meehan's grounds the 

 East Indian Indigofera Dosua is a hardy shrub, and for the past 

 two years, he said, he had watched the behavior of the flowers, 

 and the insects that visited them. The carina is arched and 

 hooded, and extends so far over the apex of the stigma, against 

 which it presses, that both the stigma and column of stamens are 

 borne down to a right angle with the vexillum. The effort of the 

 stamens and pistil to rise, and of the carina to recurve, keeps 

 these portions in an exactly horizontal position. The anthers 

 burst while thus enclosed in the carina, but the pollen does not 

 escape, nor does it reach the stigma, for the pistil extends beyond 

 the anthers, and its apex is pressed strongly against the carina, 

 and no pollen can possibly reach the apex. The two wings of 

 the flower are caught in the subulate spurs, and are borne down 

 to the horizontal plane with the carina, and together form a level 

 platform on which insects in search of honey alight. Humble- 

 bees, honej^-bees, and numerous species of sand wasps visit the 

 flowers, but in no instance was an insect's visit found to be effectual 

 in liberating the stamens and pistil from the grasp of the carina. 

 This was only accomplished by slitting the upper portion of the 

 carina with a penknife. Then the divided carina would instan- 

 taneously fall back, and the stamens and pistil jerk upwards, 

 scattering a little cloud of pollen in every direction. In some 

 cases pollen so scattered would light on a stigma, but in many 

 cases the pollen would be so completely projected that none 

 could be traced to the stigma, and these probably received 

 pollen from the upper flowers where they in turn projected their 

 pollen. Possibly many were by this time too mature to profit by 

 the pollen they received, at any rate only a very small pro- 

 portion of the flowers matured seed vessels. In the older 

 flowers, the carina evidentl}' became separated from the stamens 

 and pistil only when withering away. 



Mr. Meehan remarked in conclusion, that, as noted by authors 

 quoted, so far as his observations in this part of the world 

 (Philadelphia) with this single species goes, the behavior of the 

 flowers were neither favorable to self-fertilization nor cross- 

 fertilization. If insects had pollen scattered on them, there is 

 no way by which it could be communicated to the pistils of 




294 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



other flowers. The stamens were not liberated naturally till the 

 flower had lost all attractions for insects, and the act of 

 liberating and scattering the pollen gave the pistil its first chance 

 for pollinization. The great probability is that in the majority of 

 instances the flowers are self-fertilized. 



On Parallelism in Distinct Lines of Evolution. — Exhibiting 

 some oak and chestnut leaves, Mr. Meehan remarked that the 

 fact and the theory of evolution are distinct lines of thought. 

 There seems no difficulty about the fact. That one form may 

 and has been born of a pre-existing, and often very distinct form, 

 cannot be disputed. What induces this change is another matter. 

 It is here that science desires more light. A popular belief is 

 that change of circumstances leads to change of form. This 

 theory is embodied under the word " environment." In other 

 words, plants, in their changes, are the "creatures of circum- 

 stances." In some sense this must be true. A seed will not sprout 

 unless there be a necessary " environment " of heat and moisture, 

 but this is not the sense in which " environment," as the term is 

 here used, is generally understood. If one were to say that under 

 a torrid temperature, endured for ages, a light-skinned, fair-haired 

 Caucasian, might have descendents that were like woollj^-headed, 

 dark-skinned negi'oes,it would come nearer the general understand- 

 ing of the term "environment," than some would limit it to. The 

 speaker's observations and studies had led him to what might, 

 perhaps, be regarded as the minority view. Circumstances — 

 "environment" — seemed to have no further influence than to 

 incite to action a change already ripe for development. In a 

 paper read before the American Association for the Advancement 

 of Science, 1874 (See Proceedings Hartford Meeting^ p. 6, Natural 

 History), he presented a number of facts to show that "change 

 by gradual modification is not the universal law." New forms 

 "jumped " into existence, and frequently these new foi'ms were 

 diverse from each other, under precisel}^ the same " environment " 

 so far as human knowledge had yet reached, as had been the sur- 

 rounding circumstances of the parent form. Since that time he 

 had contributed numerous observations to the Proceedings of the 

 Academy and elsewhere, confirming these views. 



To-night he would off"er to the Academy some thoughts in a 

 new line, but confirmatory of the same views. He exhibited some 

 difierent forms of the American Quercus Prinus — the chestnut 

 oaks, and a dwarf species from China, Quercus Chinensis of 

 Bunge. Also some specimens of various forms of Castanea Vesca 

 — the chestnut, and of Castanea pumila, Mx., the chinquapin. It 

 would be conceded by any evolutionist conversant with plant 

 forms, that the chestnut and the oak are not remotely descended 

 from the same parent. We may suppose, for the sake of argument, 

 that " use or disuse," or some other item in the general catalogue 

 of " environment " had aflTected some portion of the structui-e of 

 the original parent, and resulted in a slight modification, leading 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 



towards an ultimate oak or a chestnut, as the case may have been. 

 But when we take the subsequent changes — the evolution of the 

 species of oak, and the species of chestnut, each class from its 

 primordial oak or chestnut, and observe the same parallel lines 

 of change in each, it is difficult to conceive how this exact paral- 

 lelism could have come about except under a fixed law of change, 

 which provides that when changes occur they shall be in strict 

 accordance with a prior plan by which nature herself is bound — 

 laws by which, if we could only ascertain them, we could ourselves 

 foresee and define the forms that are yet to be a thousand years 

 beyond our time, and which no mere accidents of environment 

 could alter or dela3\ 



The oaks exhibited, though when we have the fruit we can see 

 they are oaks, have the foliage so like the chestnut that it is 

 difficult to determine them. The dwarf species from China is so 

 nearly like a chestnut, that only by the absence of the setaceous 

 teeth that edge the chestnut leaf, can we see any difference. But 

 the leaves are of a thicker texture than the other chestnut oaks — 

 the serratures are finer and closer together, and the undersurface 

 of the leaf is cinereous, while the chestnut oaks exhibited in com- 

 parison are of the same tint on both sides. 



Now we take the chestnuts. We have the larger growing 

 species as we have the larger growing chestnut oaks — the leaves 

 are light green on both sides, and vary in the toothing, just as 

 the chestnut oaks do — variation in each class is exactly parallel. 

 The parallelism extends to the formation of a dwai'f species. We 

 have a dwarf chestnut, Castanea pumila, just as we have a dwarf 

 chestnut oak, Quercus chinensis, and the parallelism extends to 

 the sub-characters, for the dwarf chestnut, the chinquapin, has 

 leaves of a thicker texture, the serratures are finer, and the under- 

 surface of the leaf is cinereous, while the chestnuts exhibited are 

 of the same tint on both sides. 



Mr. Meehan finally remarked that the facts seemed to him 

 stronger arguments in favor of evolution than many usually 

 offered. That the changes in two very distinct genera that we 

 only assumed to be syngenital, should be so nearly of a parallel 

 character in each, is proof they were carrying out a plan originally 

 common to both. While the fact that these original provisions, 

 as we must regard them, for these special forms have been so 

 faithfully carried out — the one on the American continent, the 

 other in Eastern Asia — despite the varying conditions of mere 

 " environment," shows how light a factor external circumstances 

 are in the evolution of forms.

Oriskany Sandstone in Lycoming Co., Pa. — Mr. Lewis Wool- 

 man remarked that, accompanied by a resident of Lycoming Co., 

 Pa., he had recently made a tour through that and the adjoining 

 county of Sullivan, with an e3^e to the geological features of the 

 region, using as a guide the most recent publications of the 

 Second Survey. In Hand Atlas X, the Oriskany formation is 

 omitted from the map of Lycoming County, while the text speaks 

 of it as " being absent." It is also omitted from the larger map 

 accompanying the Second Survey. He was, therefore, surprised to 

 find on the roadside, at the village of Pennsville, Muncy Town- 

 ship, blocks of the sandstone, containing its characteristic fossils. 



Further examination resulted in finding a belt of this forma- 

 tion ; not, however, making the bold, elevated ridge it so often 

 does elsewhere in the State, but existing as a prominence upon 

 the lower slope of the hill that rises from the north side of the 

 village, the ascent bej^ond being over the lower members of the 

 Hamilton group. Time at command being limited, the formation 

 was traced only about a mile, but without finding it to disappear. 

 The Friends' meeting house at one end of the village, and the 

 schoolhouse at the other end, both stand upon this ridge. The 

 former has its corners pointed with this sandstone, from an old 

 quarry in sight, while all around the latter are strewn weather- 

 worn fragments, beautifull}^ exhibiting the fossils. Several of the 

 houses and barns intermediate are also situated upon this forma- 

 tion, and for some of these it has furnished building material. 



The location of the belt is within the area, shown on the maps 

 as Hamilton, and a few hundred feet from the division there 

 marked as separating that group from the Lower Helderberg. 

 Along the lawn leading to the country residence of William 

 Ellicott, the rock was seen in place, pointing upward over the 

 anticlinal forming Bald Eagle Mountain. A letter from his com- 

 panion states that he has since found this rock upon the other 

 side of the mountain, in Clinton township.

Upon careful comparison of fossils in fragments brought home, 

 the following were identified as exactly agreeing witli those 

 figured by Hall, from the Oriskany of New York, viz. : Spirifer 

 arenosus, Spirifer ar rectus and Bensselaeria ovoides.

Notes on Lilium tigrinum, Gaul. — Mr. Meehan remarked that 

 on the 7th of August he was attracted by the large number of 

 honey bees (Italian) among the flowers of Lilium tigrinum. 

 There were hundreds of flowers, and everj' flower had from one 

 to six bees in them. They were not coming and going with the 

 usual expedition of honey-seeking or pollen-collecting workers, 

 but were taking things leisurely, as when feasting on a ripe peach, 

 or some other soft, sweet, and spongy fruit. It was found that 

 the\' were feeding or sucking the juices from the papillae that 

 form a ridge at the base of each division of the perianth. These 

 papillae are very numerous, minute and transparent, under a lens 

 resembling ice crystals. They are formed in two lines, but ap- 

 proximate till they resemble a single gray line, extending from 

 the base upwards for an inch in the centre of the segment. 

 Several species of butterflies — notably some large Papilios, and 

 some smaller Eudasmias, were sharing the repast with the bees. 

 An examination showed that the papillae had been pretty well 

 " chewed " up — the term " chewing " being used notwithstanding 

 the seeming impossibility from the structure of the bee's mouth, 

 that it can chew in the ordinary acceptation of the term. A 

 quantity of this papillose matter, gathered together on the point 

 of a penknife, did not indicate any sweetness, or anything beyond 

 moisture that would be popularly supposed to prove attractive 

 to bees. Inside a flower just read}^ to expand, a considerable 

 amount of moisture is excreted from the surface of the perianth. 

 In this liquid no sweetness, but some slight astringency could be 

 detected. Not even at the base, where in flowers nectar is usu- 

 ally secreted, could any sweetness be detected. It has been 

 broadly stated that color and fragrance are of use to flowers only 

 as they may serve to attract insects for purposes of pollinization ; 

 and that gaudy flowers have no fragrance. But some gaudy lilies 

 are very sweet, and here we have a gaud}' flowered species that 

 seems to have nothing in the way of sweets after an insect has 

 been attracted. Though feasting on the cellular matter, the bees 

 in no way assist in pollination. It is difficult to imagine what 

 relation the bees can have to any good economy in plant life in 

 this instance. The plant produces no fruit in this part of the 

 20 




298 PEOCEEDINQS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



world ; but this is evidently from some failure of nutrition, for 

 when it is served with its own pollen, or the pollen of other plants 

 or other species, it is alike barren. 



At pages 412, 413 in the Proceedings of the Academy for 18Y5, 

 he had called attention to the fact that in many species of lily, 

 where the flower is cernuous, the point of bendina; straightened 

 after fertilization; and the ovarium, pendulous in flower, became 

 erect. There are some in which the flowers are always erect, and 

 they seem to be just as successful in their several economies, as 

 those that are at first cernuous, and afterward erect. At tliat 

 time, with this reflection, it seemed to him reasonable to suppose 

 that the bending down of the flowers in some species was not a 

 matter of choice with the flower — if one might metaphorically use 

 this expression — but was the result of a curving of the stem made 

 for some other reason in plant economy than for good to the 

 flower or its special objects alone. But here were some specimens 

 of Lilium Hgrinum that had blown over when young. The 

 pedicles from these stems went straight down towards the earth 

 and bore the expanded flower without the slightest curve. The 

 flowers on the erect stems are all on recurved pedicels. Though 

 we are still without light as to what advantage the recurved forms 

 gain over the erect ones, this little incident teaches us, at least, 

 that it is the flower that demands the curve, and not a case of a 

 curve demanding a pendulous flower. 



Fishing Lines and Ligatures from the Silk-glands of Lepi- 

 dopterous Larvae. — A communication was received from Miss 

 Adele M. Fielde, stating that in the locality from which she 

 wrote, Swatow, China, the silk-glands are taken from the larvae 

 of several species of large lepidopterous insects just before they 

 enter the pupa stage, and are made into fishing lines. At this 

 period in the life-history of the insect, the glands are full of the 

 viscid white substance from which the cocoon is to be spun. The 

 silk-glands of a species of Atlas were found to be one yard long, 

 a tenth of an inch in diameter at the free, posterior end, and a 

 hundredth of an inch in diameter at its antei'ior end. The two 

 glands extend nearly the whole length of the body cavity, on 

 either side of the alimentary canal, lying in loops of varying 

 length, and uniting in a single duct under the mouth, as in the 

 silk-worm, Bombyx niori. The Chinese make a transverse cut 

 across the back of the caterpillar, take hold of one of the loops 

 of the silk-gland, draw it out entire, drop it in vinegar to take 

 off its external coat, then stretch it to double or treble its 

 original length, and dry it. A durable filament is thus formed, 

 strong as catgut, and much cheaper. The tenacity of the fila- 

 ment is constantly restored by soaking it for a few minutes in 

 warm rice-water, that is, in the water in which rice has been 

 boiled for food. The fishermen say that when thus prepared a

line will hold the largest fish taken on the coast. It was found, 

 however, that a single filament would not sustain more than 

 four and a half pounds. Dr. Causland, in charge of the Hospital 

 in the English Presbyterian Mission at Swatow, had successfully 

 used these filaments for tying arteries in surgical operations. 

 It was suggested that the cocoon-spinning lepidoptera of the 

 United States might furnish in their silk-glands, for the joining 

 of wounds, a thread which would have all the virtues of spun 

 silk, without its objectionable traits. Silk-worms have been 

 successfully reared in the neighborhood of Swatow, on lettuce, 

 the silk from such caterpillars being coarser than that from 

 those fed on mulberry leaves.

On the Effect of Scorpion Stings. — The following communica- 

 tion was read from Mr. Edw. H. Thompson, United States Consul 

 at Merida, Province of Yucatan : — 



" I am advised of an interesting letter from Dr. Gonzalez, of 

 Durango, read by Dr. Leidy before the Academj', in which men- 

 tion was made of the extremely venomous character of the 

 Mexican Scorpion. 



" I would state that while many cases of scorpion stings have 

 occurred within the range of my personal observation, I have yet 

 to record one that has even approached a fatal termination. 

 During the month of January last, while exploring some of the 

 ruined cities of the interior, two of my men, native Maj'^as, were 

 stung by scorpions dislodged from the ruined walls, one receiving 

 a sting upon his shoulder, while the other was punctured directly 

 upon his naked back, and very close to the spine. 



" The man receiving the sting upon his shoulder was soon 

 relieved by a few applications of strong ammonia. The other 

 complained for some time of a numbness almost approaching 

 paralysis. This feeling, however, was not sufficient to prevent 

 him from keeping upon his horse. After I had applied the 

 ammonia, and when at the end of a hard day's ride we dismounted, 

 he had practically recovered. 



" Of thirteen cases noted by me within a short while, but two 

 were of a serious nature. One was the case of my native boy, 

 and the other was that of a young Englishman who, stung upon 

 the thumb, remained in an almost paralyzed state for several 

 hours, eventually recovering. It may be well to state, in relation 




300 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



to this case, that the young man had been in the country but a short 

 while, and was at the time exhibiting the physical effects of such 

 a radical change of climate. 



" In making the above statements I do not wish it to be under- 

 stood that I impugn the truth of the statements of Dr. Gonzalez. 

 Durango and Yucatan are two States in the Mexican Republic 

 widely separate, and circumstances governing as facts in the one 

 may not so govern in the other." 



The Form of the Pupil in Snakes. — Mr. Lockinqton stated 

 that amongst the colubriform snakes, the Boidae, a family which 

 has its headquarters in South America, and has representatives 

 in the West of this country, have elliptical vertical pupils, like 

 those of rattlesnakes. At least, this is the case with Boa con- 

 strictor, B. eques, Eunectes murinus (the anaconda), Xiphosoma 

 caninum, and Xomolochirus multisectus. The Acrochordidae, or 

 wart-snakes of eastern Asia, have circular pupils. The ven- 

 omous snakes with fixed fangs are usually classed in three 

 families : Elapidae, Naiidae, or cobras, and Hydrophidse, or sea- 

 snakes. Some herpetologists unite the first two families. As 

 far as the shape of the pupil goes, they seem to agree. Naja 

 tripudians, the cobra, Naja haje, the African asp, Pseudechis 

 porphyriacus, Sipedon hsemachates, have circular pupils, as well 

 as the species of Bungarus and Elaps. The sea-snakes, so far as 

 examined, have circular pupils. This is the case with the com- 

 mon and well-known Pelamys hicolor, with Hydrophis palami- 

 doides, H. gracilis, H. nigrocinctus, Disteira dumerilii, and Pla- 

 turus fasciatus. 



Among the snakes with movable fangs, the Crotalidse (rattle- 

 snakes), and among the Yiperidae, examples of the genera Clothe, 

 Pelias, Vipera and Cerastes, have elliptical pupils, but Causus 

 rhombeatus (Causidse) has rounded ones. It is thus evident that 

 the form of the pupil has no relation to the venomous or non- 

 venomous character of the snake.

REVEESE VISION. 

 BY CHARLES MORRIS. 



The fact that we perceive objects in their correct position, 

 while their impression upon the retina is a reversed one, forms a 

 problem which has given rise to much speculation, often unprofit- 

 ably metaphysical, in the effort to explain it. None of these 

 theories of the older writers now remain current. More modern 

 authors give explanations which are little more satisfactory. 

 Giraud Teulon saj^s : " The retina sees or localizes objects where 

 they are; that is what we call ' erect;' if the picture be reversed 

 it is a mere matter of geometry." Helmholtz says : " Our 

 natural consciousness is completely ignorant even of the exist- 

 ence of the retina and of the formation of images ; how should 

 it know anything of the position of images formed upon it ? " 

 It cannot be claimed that these remarks are explanations, and we 

 may proceed to the more elaborate theory advanced by LeConte, 

 in his work on " Sight." He remarks that " the retinal image 

 impresses the retina in a definite way. This impression is then 

 conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain, and determines changes 

 there. . . . And then the brain or the mind refers or projects 

 the impression outward into space as an external image, the sign 

 or facsimile of an object producing it." He proceeds: "The 

 law may be thus stated : When the rays from any radiant strike 

 the retina, the impression is referred back along the ray line 

 (central ray of the pencil) into space, and therefore to its proper 

 placed 



It cannot be said that his arguments are suflScient to establish 

 this theory. That we mentally refer an impression to the nerve 

 extremity that received it is unquestionable, and where a limb 

 has been lost, impressions seem to be referred to the location of 

 the original nerve termination. But this is very probably a 

 result of long-continued hereditary influences, through which 

 each nerve becomes adapted to give a mental picture of the loca- 

 tion of its impressions, and continues to do so even if touched 

 at some intermediate point. In the case of sight, no localized 

 reference to the nerve extremity exists. In this sense the source 

 of our impression seems external to the body. And yet this is 

 in all probability equally a result of hereditary accommodation. 




1886.] NATUKAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 303 



What we really perceive is the impression produced upon the 

 retina, which is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. The 

 theory that the brain or mind, by some secondary action, physically 

 refers this sensation back again to the nerve extremities, or even 

 projects it beyond them into space, along reversed lines, has no 

 warrant in known physiological facts. Far more probably the 

 seeming projection is a mental action only. Natural selection 

 may have adapted each nerve to yield a sense of the distance 

 and direction of its impressions and, therefore, of their external 

 location. An animal destitute of such sense would be unable to 

 estimate the exact point of a threatened danger, and only those 

 capable of localizing their sense impressions could survive. Yet 

 if the brain estimates the distance from which any sensation 

 comes onl}' through conditions hereditarily existing in the trans- 

 mitting nerve, the idea of referred sensations, with all theories 

 based upon it, falls to the ground. The reference of a pain to 

 the natural location of an amputated foot would form a constituent 

 portion of the impression conveyed to the brain by the nerve 

 which formerly passed to that foot. In like manner the optic 

 nerve may, among its hereditarily-gained powers, have that of 

 referring its impressions to a point beyond the nerve extremity — 

 or in external space, the locality from which danger from visible 

 objects comes. But this would have no bearing upon the ques- 

 tion of the character of its impression, the retinal image as a 

 whole being mentally transferred to an external region, but in no 

 sense changed in character. The question seems to be solely one 

 of a certain power or strength possessed by the nerves, through 

 which each of them indicates that location of its impressions best 

 adapted to the efficiency of protective activity. In the case of 

 sight this distance would necessarily be bej-ond the actual posi- 

 tion of the retina, and external to the body. The same rule 

 holds good in the case of sound. In every case it is verj- prob- 

 ably a resultant of long-continued natural selection. 



We do not actually see objects. We simply perceive the 

 images of them which are impressed upon the retina. This 

 stands as a picture-plane between our mind and the universe. 

 We perceive the impressions with which it is affected — incor- 

 rectly, if this affection is in any sense an incorrect one. But the 

 conception gained from these impressions is subject to mental 

 accommodations, the result of experience and of hereditary influ- 




304 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



ences ; and we may, therefore, gain a correct idea from an impres- 

 sion which is physically incorrect. 



Though the retinal image seems to be referred by the optic nerve 

 to a position external to the eye, j^et it is certainly not exactly 

 located by the sense of sight, and the mental accommodations 

 above mentioned are the locating influences. It is said that to a 

 blind man suddenly restored to sight, the surrounding objects 

 seem like the details of a picture, and within easy reach. He 

 appears to see the retinal picture, somewhat projected, but with 

 no correction except that the reversal of the image does not 

 appear. Our perception of roundness or solidity is, then, a 

 result of experience. This is followed by a knowledge of rela- 

 tive distance, comparative location being one of the most appar- 

 ent relations between objects. But the actual distance of objects 

 which are somewhat removed from the body is learned by experi- 

 ence, aided by several of the senses. Of more distant objects, 

 we seldom properly estimate the actual distance. All this, how- 

 ever, is a result of the action of the reasoning powers, guided by 

 the senses. The evidence of the blind man assures us that what 

 we actually see is the retinal image, somewhat projected into 

 space, and diflering from an ordinary picture mainly in that it is 

 perfect in its lights and shades, and thus forcibly tends to pro- 

 duce that illusion of solidity which is the effect sought in all 

 pictures. The only correction is that of the reversal of the 

 image. This correction, therefore, seems a natural one, inherent 

 in the sense or the mind. 



In attempting an explanation of this phenomenon, in view of 

 the considerations above taken, the question may be asked : In 

 what way can the mind discover that there is anything incorrect 

 in the direction of the retinal image? To do so it must have 

 some standard of direction with which the impressions upon 

 the retina can be compared, and their agreement or disagree- 

 ment observed. If there be any such standard, it must exist in 

 one of three locations : on the retina itself, in external nature, or 

 in the mind. If on the retina, it could only be some line, or 

 group of lines, apparent to sight, and serving as directive guides 

 with which to compare retinal impressions. It need not be said 

 that nothing of the kind exists. 



The standard of comparison, therefore, by whose aid alone we 

 can discover that the retinal image is reversed, if it exists, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. S05 



must do so either in the mind or in external nature. If it be 

 internal, it must be of the nature of an idea — an innate sense of 

 absolute direction, a mental power by which we can at once 

 distinguish the truth or falsity of any apparent direction. That 

 we have any such idea of the absolute, is in itself highly improb- 

 able. It may, in fact, be readily disproved. We are aware that 

 the revolution of the earth on its axis reverses the absolute direc- 

 tion of all the objects upon its surface every twelve hours. And 

 yet this reversal is not perceptible to us. The direction of all 

 objects, as related to that of our bodies, remains unchanged, and 

 this relation is all that we perceive. Indeed, we must have 

 remained forever ignorant of the revolution of the earth but from 

 the fact that the spheres of space do not revolve with it. These 

 retain their positions in space, while those of all objects upon the 

 earth change. They, therefore, serve us as standards of compari- 

 son by whose aid we intellectually discover the earth's motion. ' 

 We never become sensibly aware of it, for the only motion 

 apparent to us is that of the spheres of space. We impute 

 motion to objects at rest, and rest to objects in motion. This 

 error could not arise, had we any innate idea of absolute direc- 

 tion, or an internal standard of comparison. Therefore the mind 

 in itself is incapable of perceiving that there has been a reversal 

 of the retinal image. It has no faculty of deciding on questions 

 of direction, and what is relatively correct is absolutelj' correct 

 to its perceptive powers. 



If we have no internal or retinal standard of direction, have we 

 any external one ? No object upon the earth's surface will serve 

 this purpose. The images of all objects alike are reversed upon 

 the retina. The same is the case in regard to the spheres of space. 

 They do not retain their true positions in this case, as in the 

 former case considered, but are reversed in direction, and the 

 whole universe is turned upside down by the crystalline lens of 

 the eye, and is perceived by the mind thus reversed. Though 

 nothing is absolutely correct, everything is relatively correct in 

 direction, and we have no guide to teach us that such a reversal 

 has taken place. 



The fact is that in this, as in the other case, we involuntarily 

 take our bod}- as the measuring rod of the universe. Distance is 

 at first estimated by the length of the arm, dimension by the 

 spread of the fingers and the sweep of the arm, and direction by 




306 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



that of the body. Our knowledge that the retinal image is 

 reversed is not gained by perception, but by our study of the 

 laws of optics. We conceive of a picture upon the retina whose 

 direction is reverse to that of the bodj^, and are puzzled to under- 

 stand why the mind does not perceive it thus reversed. In this 

 we are comparing sensations with ideas. The image of the body 

 is also reversed upon the retina, and thus its direction, as optically 

 recognized, agrees with that of all other objects. Our accepted 

 standard of direction therefore fails us in this particular. The 

 universe, as perceived by the mind through the medium of the 

 eye, is relatively in harmony in all its particulars of direction 

 and position, and unless the mind had some innate conception of 

 absolute direction, it would be impossible for it to discover that 

 a reversal of the image had taken place. We have already shown 

 that it has no such innate ideas of direction, and is entirely depend- 

 ent upon its perceptions in this particular. The body, our accepted 

 standard of direction, is perceived to be erect as compared with 

 our perception of the earth's surface. All other objects upon 

 this surface bear the same relation to it, and we have no means 

 of discovering that we are optically deceived, except by a second- 

 arj process of reasoning, based upon the laws of optics. No 

 tree, for instance, could seem to us upside down unless the earth's 

 surface seemed upside down, which is impossible. 



The mystery in which this question has been so long involved, 

 therefore, vanishes when considered from this point of view. 

 The mind fails to discover that its optical image is reversed 

 simply from the fact that this reversal includes all things, nothing 

 retaining its erect position to serve as a standard of comparison, 

 and from the second fact that the mind has no innate idea of 

 direction to make it aware of its error. There is no error in our 

 perception. Relatively it is in every particular correct, and of 

 the absolute we have no knowledge except through the process of 

 reasoning.^ 



1 Since forming these theoretical views, the writer has become aware that 

 the same theory has been previously presented. Dr. William Mackenzie — 

 "Physiology of Vision," London, 1841— says : "In the image on the 

 retina, the relative position of the parts of the object remain unchanged, 

 as well as its relations to surrounding objects. The images of all objects, 

 even those of our own bodies, are equally inverted on the retina, and there- 

 fore maintain the same relative position. Even the image of our hand, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



while used in touch, is inverted. Hence, the notion is evidently absurd, 

 that infants at first see objects upside down, and learn to see things in their 

 proper positions, by comparing the erroneous mformation acquired by sight 

 with the accurate information acquired by touch. Many of tlie lower 

 animals manifest a perception of the true position of objects by means of 

 the sense of sight from the very first, and before any experience derivable 

 from touch can have had time to operate. To some philosophers, then, 

 there appears no difficulty respecting erect vision, so long as all things 

 equally, and not some objects only, are seen by means of impressions coin- 

 cident with inverted images." He further says : "The mind neither views 

 the images on the retina, nor is in any way conscious of their existence." 



This theory is so identical with the one we have given, as to render the 

 latter, in a considerable sense, a repetition. Yet Mackenzie's views do not 

 seem well known, and are worth restating. Moreover, his theory is far 

 from being fully argued out, and no theoretical views can be held as in any 

 sense substantiated until they have been shown to be logically defensible. 

 This we have attempted to do. The hypothesis we have given of the prin- 

 ciple through which nerve impressions are mentally localized in position 

 has, we believe, not been previously advanced, but is here first presented.

ON THE FERTILIZATION OF CASSIA MARILANDICA. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



The relation of insects to flowers continues to be a question of 

 profound interest. It has never been clear to my mind that 

 insects are any material aid to plants through the pollinization 

 which they often undoubtedly accomplish. There has been little 

 to prove that in-and-in or close breeding is an injury; and it has 

 been assumed that cross-breeding among plants must be a benefit, 

 solely because arrangements for its accomplisliment surely exist. 

 I have shown in various papers (see chiefly Proceedings of 

 American Association for the Advancement of Science, Detroit 

 meeting), that in a scheme of nature for progressive development 

 there must be provided arrangements for the removal of old as 

 well as for the introduction of new forms, and from the facts ad- 

 duced we have as much right to look on them in the light of 

 agencies for removal as for the strength and preservation of a 

 race. In my mind, the facts rather show that instead of any 

 material aid to the propagation of the race being gained, the 

 dependence of a plant on insect aid for fertilization is rather an 

 indication that its race is nearly run, and that it is on the down- 

 ward track in the order of nature. 



The assumption that cross-fertilization is a factor in develop- 

 ment instead of in degradation, has, I believe, been an injury to 

 the study of the main question, as it has led to generalizations 

 that cannot be sustained, and to assertions regarding facts that I 

 think would not have been made had not the observers been pre- 

 possessed in favor of this hypothesis. The followers of those 

 who have done so much to advance this branch of science, have 

 gone much further in their speculations than those who first 

 originated the line of thought ; and even the leading minds in 

 that path have often been the victims of an enthusiasm of which 

 their cooler moments would not approve. Here and there we 

 meet with statements by even such eminent naturalists as Darwin 

 and Asa Gray, that would seem to sustain the wide genralizations 

 of Grant Allen or Sir John Lubbock ; but a careful study of their 

 writings will show that they look on cross-fertilization as a fact, 

 and as a. i|iea.snre of race utility, from a much more limited field 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



than the supporters of the wider speculations seem to believe. 

 It is not the most eminent writers who assert that " cross-fertiliza- 

 tion is the general rule," " the greater number of flowers are 

 cross-fertilized," etc. (see Popular Science Remew^ 1813), though 

 the casual expression of Dr. Asa Gray, in his papers of 1877, 

 that " many flowers freely self-fertilize," certainly might imply 

 self-fertilizers to be a minority of the whole ; but the same eminent 

 botanist has also said " it is a common case that flowers cross- 

 fertilize when duly served by insects or wind, and self-fertilize 

 when not," and this by no means bears the impression that he 

 regards self-fertilizing flowers as composing a particularly limited 

 class. Indeed no one is more severe than Dr. Gray on theory- 

 makers who run oft" in haste on one line of facts. The true 

 sentiments of Dr. Gray are that " cross-fertilization, we may well 

 believe, is a very risky affair," and in view thereof very few plants 

 have become wholly dependent on this mode, but act on the rule 

 to prefer cross-fertilization " if they can," but failing in this, to 

 self-fertilize, " if they must," And, though it is not so generally 

 understood, I think a careful study of Mr. Darwin's works will 

 show that this is essentially his view also. 



Though unwilling to concede that any material benefit comes 

 to the races of plants from the aid which insects give to plants 

 by cross-fertilization, the fact that some species arre evidently 

 wholly dependent on this agency for fertility, is no less interest- 

 ing, and any original observations must have value to the student 

 of this branch of science. 



Cassia, in a general way, has been a subject of study. In 1875 

 Dr. Leggett writes (Bull. Torr. Club, p. 171) that Dr. Torrey had 

 noticed the difficulty Cassia niclitans had in rejecting its pollen. 

 Dr. Torrey believed, however, that though the anthers seemed to 

 provide a pore at the apex for the emission of pollen, they finally 

 slit longitudinall}", and thus permitted the pollen to escape. Dr. 

 Leggett does not seem satisfied of this. In 1882, however, Prof. 

 J. E. Todd published some extremely interesting observations on 

 this species, and on Solanum rostraturn, which has a similar 

 staminal arrangement (see Am. Naturalist. Ap. 1882, p. 281-287). 

 C. Marilandica is referred to as one that would probably behave 

 in the same way. Before noting what Mr. Todd saw in these, I 

 will note the observations I have made on this species. 



As nothing seems to have been placed on record in relation to 




316 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



Cassia Ifarilandica, and I having a good opportunity for daily 

 observation, I undertook its close investigation this year. In 

 Cassia Marilandica the flower consists of five petals, as in other 

 leguminosse; but the two whi<!h usually unite and form the carina 

 are here distinct and spread widely, taking the place apparently 

 often occupied by the wing-petals. The two actual wing-petals 

 are somewhat erect and lap under the upper or vexillum. This 

 arrangement gives the flower a "somewhat two-lipped appear- 

 ance." The style curves gradually, but more rapidly at the apex, 

 curving there so much that the stigmatic surface can scarcely be 

 closely examined without breaking the style. If the petals be 

 opened just before the natural time for their expansion, a globule 

 of liquid is pendant from the surface. The stamens are arranged 

 in separate sets. There are three beneath the pistil — the two 

 lateral ones are very strong and equal the pistil in length — the 

 central one immediately beneath the pistil is as long as those on 

 each side, but more slender. Immediately above the pistil are 

 four stamens, with short, stout filaments, the anthers being per- 

 fectly formed, and nearly as long as in the lower set. Above are 

 three petaloid stamens, which we can only see are staminal efforts, 

 by noting the intermediate stages of the several parts between 

 the stamens and petals. The only use for them seems to be to 

 afi"ord a good morphological lesson to the student. 



The most interesting feature of this Cassia is that the stamens, 

 not mono or diadelphous as in many leguminosai, have long, 

 black anthers, full of pollen, but which seem never to burst the 

 anther cases. The only " opening is at the apex," and this " open- 

 ing " is covered by a membrane — never opening, as I believe, 

 except by insect agency. 



As soon as the flower expands it is freely visited by humble 

 bees, and, as their loaded thighs evidence, for the pollen. To 

 collect this, they alight on the anthers of the long and lower 

 stamens, as on a platform — make an opening in the apex of each 

 of the four shorter ones, and then rifle them of their contents. I 

 watched a mass of plants containing eiglitj'-eight flower stems, on 

 the 30th of July, and the same lot for an hour on 6th of August, 

 but saw no attempt to get pollen from the longer anthers, or to 

 use them in any way but as a platform. It would, indeed, be 

 hardly possible for the bee to stand anywhere so as to get power 

 to pierce the apical membranes of the longer stamens. When the 




1880.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PniLADELPHIA. 317 



flower matured, and tlie anthers were ready to fall, they were exam- 

 ined — the four short ones were empty sacs — the three lower ones 

 proved they had not served any purpose to the bees, for they 

 were full of pollen. There could be no doubt that, perfect and 

 full of pollen as they were, they served no purpose that I could 

 see either to the flower or to its insect visitors. Hive bees on 

 honey-collecting expeditions hunted around among the base ot 

 the petals, but were not, apparently, well rewarded for their work. 

 No pollen could be detected on the stigmatic surface; but as about 

 three out of every twelve flowers yielded a pod, they were evi- 

 dentl}' fertilized in some way. On the 30th of July I covered 

 one panicle that had not j'et opened a blossom, with a gauze bag 

 twelve inches wide and eighteen inches deep, tied at the bottom 

 to prevent ingress. Not one of these enclosed flowers produced 

 a seed vessel, nor could I see that any one anther " opened at the 

 apex." The membrane covered it as completely as it did in the 

 unopened flower. 



Now all these observations confirm those of Mr. Todd in the 

 other plants except in the following particulars : As in my 

 case, he found that the bees never attempted to collect pollen 

 from the longer and lower anthers, but " b3^ the movement of 

 her feet the larger stamen is repeatedly sprung backward, and 

 as often throws a cloud of pollen on one side of her bodj-." I 

 am sure no pollen was ejected in this wa}^ from Cassia Marilan- 

 dica, for the membrane at the apex was not even ruptured when 

 the stamens were ready to fall. In regard to the manner in which 

 the pollen is extracted, he found that " this she does by seizing 

 each anther near its base between her mandibles, and, with a sort 

 of milking motion, crowds the pollen out of the terminal pore." 

 If this were the general way there would be no necessitj^ for any 

 pollen being ejected from the long stamens, for the stigma would 

 certainl}^ receive some during the " milking " process ; and the 

 pore at the apex in the long anther is beyond the line of the 

 stigma, so that on ejection from the pore the pollen would go 

 still further beyond. At any rate I am satisfied that in this 

 species the anther cases did not under my observation ultimately 

 split longitudinally^ as stated by Dr. Torrey in an allied species, 

 nor was there an}' drawing out of the pollen, as observed by Prof. 

 Todd. It is abstracted solely through the pores; and although I 

 could see no evidence that such was actually the case, I suspect 




318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



fertilization could only occur through some of this extracted 

 pollen escaping from the insect to the stigma. 



However, the fact was clearly demonstrated that Cassia Mari- 

 landica^ in this experiment, does not produce a single seed, when 

 the flowers are protected from the visits of insects. 



This plant is the more interesting as it belongs to an order 

 which the enthusiasts to whom I have referred, see " from its struc- 

 ture " to be so well " arranged for cross-fertilization,'' but which 

 those who, like the following author, have followed results, see 

 just the reverse. " To the casual observer of typical structures 

 the papilionaceous plants must present the most difficult nut to 

 crack for a student of cross-breeding. * * * As might be expec- 

 ted from the structure of the flowers, we have in these plants 

 persistent examples of self-fertilization, and hence the constancy 

 of garden varieties " (Gard. Mag., Feb. 3, 18TT).

Chinese Women and Spiritism. — The following communication 

 was read from Miss Adele M. Fielde: — In the eighth month 

 of the year, early in autumn, when the full moon is worshipped; 

 when the gods of grain are rewarded with gifts ; when friends 

 exchange many souvenirs ; when the upper and nether worlds 

 are thought to touch boundaries, then the Chinese women meet 

 privately and fall into trances. Nearly all women are interested 

 in these secret sessions, but many are prevented from being 

 present by necessary occupations elsewhere, or by fear of rebuke 

 from the men of their households. These conclaves are entered 

 by women only, and are regarded by men with great disfavor. 

 The women assemble in an apartment where they may be for a 

 few hours secure from interruption. From three to a dozen or 

 more gather around a table in the centre of the room. Incense- 

 sticks, spirit-money and bamboo-roots, bought by a previous con- 

 tribution of farthings, are distributed among all present. A 

 fetich of some sort, a decayed splint hat, an old broom, a chop- 

 stick, or possibly a more uncleanly object, taken from a rubbish 

 heap, is brought in, and spirit-money is burned before it, with 

 obeisances. Then those who desire to fall into trance sit down 

 at the table, throw a black cloth over the head, hold a sheet of 

 spirit-money and a lighted incense-stick between the palms before 

 the face, shut the eyes, and remain motionless and silent. Of the 

 other women, some light incense-sticks and whirl them around the 

 heads of the sitters ; some rap constantly, gently and rapidly, with 

 the bamboo-roots on the edge of the table ; some chant invoca- 




320 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



tions, petitioning the gods to admit these their children to their 

 abode. Many and diverse incantations are iterated. One, given 

 to me by a woman who appeared to be an expert, may be trans- 

 lated as follows : 



Sister spirit, ghost of nun. Spirit, spirit, come and reach 



Body take by sharing one ; Hand to lead us ; vouchsafe speech ; 



Two or three await tliee here, Be incarnate iu us here ; 



Choose in which thou wilt appear. Choose in whom thou wilt appear. 



Two or three of the women, perhaps, fall into trance. Their 

 doing so is indicated by their trembling violently, dropping the 

 incense-sticks they were holding, beginning to beat the table with 

 the palms of their hands, and to discourse incoherently. Tliey 

 si)eak of meeting their own lost friends, or those of other women 

 who are present. They weep bitterly while they appear to con- 

 verse with the dead. They descrilie streets, shops and houses 

 and say that certain person are engaged in agriculture or trade. 

 Sometimes they, by request, make inquiry concerning the where- 

 abouts of a dead person, and then give the information that he 

 has been born into the human family for the second time. Some- 

 times they report that a dead neighbor is shut up in Hades with 

 nothing to eat but the salted flesh of the infant daughters she 

 destroyed when she was alive. 



Many women go to these meetings merely as observers ; many 

 more go in order to avail themselves of what the^^ believe to be 

 an opportunity to hear from dead relatives ; a few go with the 

 hope that they may themselves fall into trance, and see the spirit 

 of some recently deceased friend. It is said tliat those who wish 

 to enter Elysium and see the dwellings of the gods and geni, 

 must make the attempt in the forenoon, while those who wish to 

 visit lower spheres get admittance only in the afternoon. 



As no pecuniary benefit accrues, directly or indirectly, to the 

 actors in these scenes, there is less reason for suspecting conscious 

 deception than in the case of the public interpreters for the gods. 

 No foreign lady can get access to these sittings, and no native 

 Christian woman is admitted to them. It is said that no one falls 

 into the trance-state, if a Monotheist be within sight or hearing. 

 My knowledge is gained wholly from a score of Chinese women, 

 now my pupils, who in former years attended these sittings, and 

 who have described to me the scenes of the eighth month. 



Throughout the whole there is indication that the minds of the 

 women are, during these trances, moving in customary grooves. 

 They evidently see what they expect to see. The gardens of 

 Elysium are laid out in Chinese style ; the architecture of the 

 buildings is Chinese ; the punishments are those made familiar to 

 the imagination by Buddhism and Tauism ; the costumes, the 

 implements, and the paraphernalia are such as are common in 

 Swatow. These seekers after truth in the land of shades bring

back no ideas save those which thej took with them when starting 

 on their quest; and this leads one to doubt, in spite of their dis- 

 heveled liair, pallor and exhaustion, whether they have after all 

 really been away from home. 



At nightfall the supposed traveler is lured back b}^ incantations, 

 and then she slips slyly back into her accustomed duties, with no 

 chance, for another whole year perhaps, to take a jaunt either 

 with body or soul.

HISTORY AND BIOLOGY OF PEAR BLIGHT. 



BY J. C. ARTHUR. 



To the American orchardist or nurseryman the name of pear 

 blight, or fire blight, as it is often called, brings to mind a serious 

 malady of fruit trees, which has been the theme of incessant dis- 

 cussion by horticultural writers and speakers since the earliest 

 days of fruit culture in this country. The most marked features 

 of the disease were admirably characterized by William Coxe^ at 

 the beginning of the present century, in the following words : 

 " That species of blight which is sometimes called the fire blight, 

 frequently destroys trees in the fullest apparent vigor and health, 

 in a few hours, turning the leaves suddenly brown, as if they had 

 passed through a hot flame, and causing a morbid matter to exude 

 from the pores of the bark, of a black ferruginous appearance ; 

 this happens through the whole course of the warm season, more 

 frequently in weather both hot and moist." The disease occurs 

 from Canada and Minnesota on the north, to Georgia and Louis- 

 iana on the south, and from the eastern limit of the Rocky 

 Mountains to the Atlantic ocean. No part of this vast extent of 

 country is exempt, although it does not appear with the same 

 frequency and power in all localities, and is usually rare in the 

 immediate vicinitj'^ of the sea-coast. 



So far as at present known, it is exclusively confined to this 

 part of North America. This is pai'tly inferred from the absence 

 of any distinct mention of such a disease in the horticultural 

 literature of other regions, and partly from direct testimony. 

 Prof. Dwindle, late of the University of California, has told the 

 writer that it does not occur on the Pacific coast. Dr. De Bary,^ 

 whose word carries great weight, says, after giving a brief 

 description of the disease, "this phenomenon is not to my knowl- 

 edge known in Europe." A long account of the disease has been 

 published by Dr. Wakker,^ in a gardening journal of Holland, in 

 order to learn if it occurs in that country, but up to the present

time no One has intimated any knowledge of it. In a recent 

 letter Dr. Masters, editor of the Gardeners' Chronicle of England, 

 says that no such disease has been recognized in the British Isles. 

 The testimony of one of our own horticulturists, Prof Budd,^ of 

 Iowa, who is familiar with the disease in this country, and has 

 inspected the orchards of the old world far into Russia, is especi- 

 ally valuable ; he says " no trace of blight of pear- or apple-trees 

 can be seen in Europe." From these statements, and the infer- 

 ences to be drawn from other sources, it appears highly probable 

 that the disease does not extend to Europe. An account of the 

 principal diseases of fruit-trees of New Zealand, by Prof. T. Kirk,^ 

 has been published, which describes a disease of the pear known 

 in that country as Jire blight, due to a fungus, and another of the 

 apple, the American blight, due to an insect. No true pear blight, 

 as recognized in the United States, is mentioned, and in a recent 

 communication the author has definitely stated that it is not 

 known in the colon}'. Whether it occurs in other parts of the 

 world is not yet ascertained, if some slight testimony regarding 

 its absence in Japan be excepted. 



It is only within a year or so that European writers have become 

 aware of its existence, and this only through American authors. 

 It is remarkable that a disease of such virulence and so easily 

 transported should not have found its wslj across the ocean, when 

 one remembers the number of destructive plant maladies that 

 America has already involuntarily foisted upon European culti- 

 vators. It will not be profitable to speculate much at this time 

 upon the reasons for this, but we may suppose that the small 

 exportation of American fruit-trees, or of scions,^ has been a 

 factor in keeping it in check. The influence of climate, and some 

 less evident factors, need not be discussed in this connection. 



Amount of Loss. — It has already been intimated that pear 

 blight is a frequent and destructive affection ; it will tend to give 

 a fairer appreciation of the subject if it be stated how frequent 

 and how destructive it is. Coxe,* as earlj' as 1817, in the oldest 

 pomological work by an American author, saj^s it " frequently

destroys trees in the fullest apparent vigor and hejflth, in a few 

 hours ; I have in twenty years lost upwards of fifty trees." The 

 years 1826 and 1832 were notable in horticultural circles for the 

 increased prevalence of the disease; but it was in 1844 that the 

 most widespread and fatal epidemic, that the country has yet 

 known, occurred. Few, if any, pear-orchards escaped at that 

 time without the partial or total loss of many trees, and some 

 orchards, even large ones, were quite destroyed. The following 

 year the epidemic was much lighter, and had full}^ disappeared 

 by 1846. Although it had subsided as an epidemic, it still 

 occurred in localities here and there, and has continued to do so 

 until the present time. Judging from the communications in the 

 horticultural press, the whole countrj^, or various sections of it 

 independently, have been subject at various times to epidemic 

 visitations, but none have equaled in severity that of the memor- 

 able year of 1844. 



It is often maintained that a certain periodicity of occurrence 

 is observable, the periods usually being placed at five, ten, or 

 twenty years. A careful examination of the literature of the 

 subject, however, gives little support to these views, and makes 

 it more probable that the intervals are irregular, and that they 

 vary for difi"erent sections of the country. The year of maximum 

 prevalence maj^ or may not be preceded by one in which the 

 disease is noticeably common, but it is quite invariably followed 

 by a year or two of successive decadence. 



In the absence of exact statistics, which it has not been prac- 

 ticable to obtain, something of the important nature of the disease 

 may be gathered from the statements of horticultural writers and 

 the phraseology which they employ in speaking of it. 



The renowned horticulturist, A. J. Downing,^ called it the 

 "monstrous malady of the pear." Chas. R. Baker ^ says it is 

 " the worst malady with which the cultivator of the pear-tree has 

 to contend." In southern Pennsylvania " the pear is so geperally 

 destroyed by the blight," according to J. B. Garber^ writing in 

 1850, "that very few trees are to be found." At Philadelphia, 

 however, the disease has been rarely observed, according to

Thomas Meehan.' T. T. Lyons,^ of Michigan, states as the 

 opinion of many cultivators in that State, that the pear-tree can- 

 not be grown with financial success on account of the blight. 

 Illinois has always been much subject to the disease, and Prof J. 

 B. Turner,^ in 1868, gave expression to the general feeling of his 

 region by describing it as " that deadly Upas of the pear-tree 

 known par excellence as the pear-blight." In 1882 Dr. J. L. 

 Hallum,* speaking for southern Illinois, says, " pears have failed, 

 utterly failed, so that none are now cultivated for market, the 

 blight has destroyed the trees —branch and root," and S. G. 

 Minkler,^ in the northern part of the State, observes that it is a 

 ver}'^ uncommon thing to see pear-trees without dead branches Or 

 other signs of tlie ravages of blight. Wm. A. Nourse,^ of the 

 same State, is led to " doubt if one-tenth of the pear-trees that 

 are set, live ten years," on account of this one destructive agent. 

 Geo, M. Dewey ,^ of Missouri, says that '' with good cultivation 

 and rich soil the pear generally dies of blight before the eighth 

 year." In Minnesota the severe climate has not permitted the 

 cultivation of pears, and almost the only apples grown for many 

 years were the hardy crab-apples. The latter have been rapidly 

 improved, and together with the hardier varieties of the common 

 apple would now furnish this part of the country with an abundant 

 supply of fruit, were it not for this same disease, which elsewhere 

 most conspicuously preys upon the pear-tree. E. H. S. Dartt ^ 

 held the opinion in 1874 that the severity of winter was not so 

 much to be dreaded as the ravages of blight. He had at that 

 time one or two thousand trees affected. Dr. P. A. Jewell,^ up to 

 1876, had lost ten thousand Tetofsky apple-trees by it. F. G. 

 Gould *" says that " onlj' for this scourge every family living on a 

 farm in Minnesota could have a supply of apples."

Citations enough have doubtless been given, although several 

 pages of equally strong ones might be added, to show that fruit- 

 growers, who have this best opportunities for observation, con- 

 sider it a disease greatly to be dreaded and one of special economic 

 importance. Other sections of the country, notably those of 

 Ohio, western New York and Georgia, could furnish equally im- 

 portant proof of these propositions. All that is desired in this 

 connection, however, is to give those not familiar with the subject 

 some idea of the disease and its eflfects as ordinarily observed 



Early Records. — The oldest mention of the disease, that gives 

 a good and reasonably full description of it, is in Coxe's work on 

 fruit-trees, bearing the date of 1817. The manner of the author 

 leaves no doubt that it was well known at that time, and the 

 reference to his losses during twenty years makes it reasonably 

 certain that he had observed the disease as early as the opening 

 of the century. The earliest notice, however, which has yet come 

 to hand, is in a letter written by Wm. Denning,^ describing the 

 disease in apples, pears, and quinces. He speaks of first observ- 

 ing it on the Highlands of the Hudson in 1780. 



There is no interest, however, in tracing chronologically the 

 various notices found in different publications, for without excep- 

 tion they have the tone of treating a familiar theme, and show no 

 evidence that the disease in the first part of the century was in 

 any respect difi'erent from to-day. 



Conjectures Regarding its Cause. — A brief treatment of this 

 topic will be all that is required for the purposes of this paper ; 

 and only those hypotheses will be touched upon which received 

 such careful presentation as to attract the favorable attention of 

 the public. 



Few writers appear to ascribe the disease to a single agency, 

 but reo-ard it as resulting from several causes, either acting to- 

 gether or brought about by dissimilar circumstances. Little dis- 

 crimination is made between predisposing conditions and active 

 ao-ents. In fact sharply defined treatment could not be expected 

 when all was conjecture, and when the shrewdest observers did 

 not hesitate to avow that after years of loss under all kinds of 

 experimentation, and after interminable discussions, the cause 

 still lay shrouded in impenetrable obscurit)%

Coxe,^ who has had man}' followers, thought that the hot raj's 

 of the sun when acting through a misty or saturated atmosphere 

 deranged the vital activities of the plant and brought about the 

 disease. He considered old varieties more subject to it, on 

 account of having lower constitutional vigor, than new varieties, 

 of which the St. Germain and Seckel were respectively conspicu- 

 ous instances. 



The insect theoiy, as it was called, was promulgated at this 

 time. It was started upon firm facts by the discovery of a small 

 brown beetle, about two millimeters long, which penetrated the 

 branch, and caused the part beyond to die. The beetle received 

 the name of Scolytus pyri Peck, now changed to Xylehorus pyri 

 Pk., and is still known as tlie blight beetle. The effect of its 

 attack appears to the casual observer similar to that of the true 

 blight — the branch in June or July rapidly withers, and the leaves 

 and fruit turn black. The beetles being minute and inconspicuous 

 escape attention, and the fact that the branch does not die below 

 a definite point is sometimes overlooked. It is not difficult to 

 see how many persons came to connect this comparatively rare 

 affection with the common fire blight, and to believe that insects 

 of some sort were to be held accountable for all — their supposed 

 minuteness and waiy habits being sufficient reasons for the failure 

 to find them, and the spread of the disease along the limbs of a 

 tree being ascribed to a poison which the insects were supposed 

 to emit. Among the prominent supporters of this view was the 

 " Genesee Farmer," ^ published at Rochester, N. Y., with Patrick 

 Barry as the horticultural editor. It has not, however, been so 

 strongly advocated for the last decade or two. 



The next hypothesis that attracted general attention was known 

 as the frozen-sap theory. This was based upon the supposition 

 that the autumn or winter freezing of unripe wood produced a 

 poison which the moving currents of sap the next spring and 

 summer distributed, causing the death of the parts. It was first 

 published in 1844 b}^ Rev. H. W. Beecher,^ of Indiana, in a long 

 and able article in " Hovey's Magazine." In the following j^ear

it was independently elaborated by A. J. Downing^ in bis work 

 on Fruits and Fruit-trees of America, who first called it the 

 frozen-sap theory, and who is usually spoken of as the author of 

 it. This view has probably had more firm adherents than any 

 other, as it explained many phenomena connected with the dis- 

 ease in a fairly satisfactory manner. It was especially well 

 received in the western States, 



The next hypothesis which gained the attention of the public 

 was the fungus theory. Its first successful presentation was in 

 1863 by Dr. J. H. Salisbury,^ who figured the fungus which he 

 decided to be the specific cause of this kind of blight, and ven- 

 tured to give it a name, although he was sadly in error in most that 

 he did. Thomas Meehan,^ editor of the " Gardener's Monthly," 

 has ably championed this explanation, and done much to keep it 

 in favor. In 1875, Dr. J. G. Hunt,'' by Mr. Meehan's request, 

 undertook a microscopical examination of blighted pear-twigs, 

 and confirmed the opinion that it was due to a fungus, without, 

 however, deciding upon the specific character of it. 



Blighted trees often attract attention immediately after a 

 thunder storm, and from this and other circumstances the belief 

 that the malady is due to electricit}' has gained many adherents, 

 but the argument has not had a full and connected presentation. 



The last hypothesis of historical importance is the bacterial 

 theory. Although hinted at by a number of horticultural writers, 

 yet the credit of it is due to Prof. T. J. Burrill,^ who in 1878 dis- 

 tinctly stated his belief that the cause resides with the bacteria 

 which he found in great abundance in the tissues of afiected 

 branches. In 1880 he performed a series of experiments^ by 

 inoculating healthy branches with the juices of diseased ones, the 

 results of which were presented to the American Association at 

 its Boston meeting, thus first bringing the subject clearly to the

attention of the scientific world. Although this was now the 

 popular hypothesis, it cannot he said to have received more sub- 

 stantial credence than those which had gone before, either from 

 the horticulturists or the scientists. The experimental results 

 gained hy Prof. Burrill were confirmed and extended by the 

 writer ^ during 1884, by means of a similar series of inoculations. 



Of the multitude of minor hypotheses which were put forth in 

 explanation of phenomena connected with pear-blight, and which 

 were variously received, and of all degrees of plausibility, it is 

 impossible to speak at this time without carrying this paper to 

 undue length. 



Beginning of Experimental Research. — The question of the 

 cause of pear-blight was finally removed from the domain of 

 speculation to that of established fact by a series of crucial 

 experiments performed by the writer ^ a year ago, and recorded 

 in a paper before the American Association at the Ann Arbor 

 meeting. These consisted in showing that the bacteria when 

 removed from the tree and passed through a series of artificial 

 cultures would generate the disease when again introduced into 

 the tree, and that the juices accompanying blight when cleared 

 of bacteria by filtration will not produce the disease. 



Having now come to a firm basis for scientific advancement, let 

 us look over the historical ground again to see if some one did 

 not hit upon the true explanation of the disease, although he may 

 not have been aware of its significance. In a connection like 

 this, facts derived from experiment have greater weight than 

 statements of opinion ; the latter acquire importance in propor- 

 tion as they are logically derived from correct and close observa- 

 tion. Bearing tbis in mind, we need not give much heed to the 

 not uncommon inference that pear-blight was in some way inti- 

 mately related to the epidemic diseases of man, e. g. cholera. 

 This view is said to have been quite frequently entertained in the 

 early part of the century, but was not sanctioned by the learned. 

 The use of such phrases as " first cousin to the cholera," " a spe- 

 cies' of vegetable ferment," etc., surely does not entitle the author 

 to any priority in way of discovery.

We turn from these slight hints to the record of an experiment 

 in inoculation, made in 1845 and published the following year. 

 We are told by S. B. Gookins,^ of Indiana, that visiting Mr. 

 Ragan (the same person who furnished Mr. Beecher with many 

 of the facts on which he founded the theory to which we have 

 already referred) he was shown a thrifty young pear-tree in the 

 nursery, which had been " inoculated " " by way of experiment " 

 with " the sap of a blighted tree," " a few days previous." " He 

 made an incision about three feet from the ground, lifted the 

 bark as in the process of budding, and injected a small quantity 

 of the diseased sap." " We found the leaves of the patient chang- 

 ing color, and emitting that peculiar odor which is always present 

 in cases of blight, and upon applying the knife, the inner bark 

 was found to be black from the root to the top, while nothing of 

 the kind appeared elsewhere in the nursery." 



This admirable experiment was combined with a no less admir- 

 able interpretation of the cause of blight. The writer cites facts 

 to disprove the hypothesis of Mr. Beecher, and then says : " I 

 strongly incline to the belief, that the pear-blight is an epidemic, 

 that it prevails like other epidemics, and will pass off like them. 

 The atmosphere is, I believe, generally admitted to be the medium 

 by which they prevail, and are carried from place to place. What 

 that subtle principle may -be, which pervades our atmosphere, by 

 which infection is retained and transmitted, human science has 

 not discovered ; but that such a principle exists is sufficiently 

 obvious from its effects." 



This clearly conceived elucidation of the matter could onlj'- 

 have been improved by a knowledge of the germ theory of disease, 

 and when we remember the date at which it was uttered, we do 

 not feel that the writer was guilty of any lack of acuteness in not 

 perceiving the relation which we now know to exist between his 

 theory and his facts. He seems to have been a modest man, for 

 he only signs his initials, and does not defend his views when the 

 editor, A. J. Downing,^ opposes the opinion that " an epidemic 

 conveyed by the atmosphere is too slightly supported by facts to 

 weigh at all against the observations of cultivators," which 

 " strongly point to the freezing of the sap as the cause."

Another interesting experiment was performed by Dr. E. S. 

 Hull,i of Illinois, in 1868. Having received some blighted apple 

 twigs from a correspondent, he cut pieces from them with which 

 he " inoculated several succulent pear shoots by tying in the pieces 

 as in budding." This was done the middle of June, and no ob- 

 servation taken for thirty-four days, when the blight was found 

 to have extended several inches into the healthy tissues. From 

 this he very justly concludes that the blight in apples and pears 

 is but one disease, but seems to take it for granted that in both 

 it is due to " vitiated sap." 



The fact that the disease may be transferred to healthy trees 

 by the pruning knife has been observed by several persons. H. 

 Wendell,^ of New York, says in 1849, "I am also careful that the 

 blade of the knife is perfectly clean, and that it has none of the 

 sap of a diseased tree adhering to it, because I have known many 

 valuable trees destro^-ed by having been inoculated in this man- 

 ner." Prof. Turner,^, of Illinois, makes a similar statement : " I 

 found that this disease is exceedingly contagious, for if I used 

 my knife to prune a healthy tree after having used it in shaving 

 the diseased one, I communicated the disease to that tree." 



Prof. Burrill first observed the bacteria of blight in 1817,* 

 but did not recognize them as such till the following year,^ when 

 he avowed his belief that they were the cause of the disease. 

 His first inoculation experiments were made in 1880, as already 

 stated. In 1882 he characterized the organism under the name 

 of Micrococcus amylovorus.^ 



Description of Micrococcus amylovorus Bur. — The form of 

 this species of bacteria is very constant, under all conditions. 

 The single cells are from oval to roundish-ovoid, and only vary 

 by slight changes in the ratio between their length and breadth

(PI. Ill, figs. 1, 2, 6). They are 1 to 1^/j. long, by ^ to | /j. broad, 

 and quite colorless. For the most part, they exist as single inde- 

 pendent cells, but may often be found in pairs, especially when 

 still multiplying, and in rare instances are united into a series of 

 four or even more, but never extend into chains. 



During rapid vegetation, in rich nutritive media, the move- 

 ments reach a stage of extreme activity. The appearance is 

 what is termed swarming, in which the bacteria move rapidly 

 back and forth, in and out among each other, but never in a 

 straight line to any distance. As the rate of growth becomes 

 less from any cause the movements are retarded. Taken directly 

 from the tissues of a blighting tree, the movements of transla- 

 tion are usuall}^ sluggish or imperceptible, although the universal 

 Brownian movement is likely to give a misleading appearance of 

 activity. Under speciallj'- favorable conditions, as when grown 

 during hot weather in very succulent shoots, or from artificial 

 inoculation in unripe fruit, the movements are much increased 

 and may become quite rapid. When taken from the tree in 

 winter, or when grown in solutions that are too acid or too alka- 

 line, or which are deficient in the proper nutritive substances, 

 there is no perceptible locomotion. 



When in active growth, the cells present a uniformly dull 

 appearance. By conditions which are unfavorable to normal 

 gi'owth, yet do not entirely check it, such as strongly acid or 

 alkaline solutions, deficient nutriment, or exhaustion by keeping 

 the cultures several months, the cells become highly refractive, 

 and to some extent take on the appearance of the spores of 

 other species of bacteria. Whether in this state they possess 

 any of the characteristic powers of resistance which belong to 

 spores, has not been ascertained. 



Formation of Zoogloea. — By far the most characteristic feature 

 in the life history of Micrococcus amylovorus is the formation of 

 zoogloea (figs. 2, 3, 5). These have never been observed in the 

 tissues of the tree under any conditions, or in or upon any sort 

 of solid media, but they occur with much regularity in fluid 

 cultures, when placed under favorable conditions for rapid 

 growth. 



They are produced to some extent throughout the fluid, but 

 are most abundant in the thin pellicle which forms upon the 

 surface, appearing within forty-eight hours from the beginning 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 333 



of the culture. The substance of the pellicle consists of a color- 

 less matrix uniformly filled with motionless bacteria, and against 

 this the zoogloea are sharply defined. They are often brought out 

 yet more distinctly by being surrounded by a colorless layer, free 

 of bacteria, which is doubtless an extension of the ground sub- 

 stance of the zoogloea mass (fig. 4). 



The masses are far more dense than the pellicle, and are com- 

 pactly filled with refractive bacteria. They possess a definite 

 outline, and are recognizable when very small ; and although 

 they may reach 30 to 40 p. long by 20 to 30 ,u wide, they rarely 

 lose their distinctness. When below 10 ij. in length, their usual 

 form is oblong, varying to globular. They occur singly, or united 

 more or less intimately end to end in pairs, and sometimes several 

 form a short chain. At this stage they possess a uniformly even 

 and unbroken surface, which now becomes uneven and wrinkled, 

 and is finally thrown into folds, giving some resemblance to the 

 external aspect of the brain. Zoogloea more than 20 p. in length 

 have the folds of somewhat unequal height, and the sinuses deeper, 

 giving a stronger cerebric look, or when the folds are small and 

 circular, they are better described as mulberry-like. The elon- 

 gated forms, which at some stage of growth might doubtless have 

 been composed of two or more distinct masses, often take on a 

 vermiform appearance. But whatever the variations may be, the 

 distinctness of outline, the general form, and the cerebric surface 

 are unfailing characters, which so far as my knowledge extends, 

 are not found in any other species of bacteria. 



Cultivation in Fluid Media. — The range of substances which 

 may serve as culture media for this organism is very wide. An 

 infusion of almost any vegetable substance containing a fair 

 amount of soluble carbohydrates is likely to be sufficient to enable 

 growth to take place, even if not very luxuriantly. 



The substance which on the whole has proved most satisfactory 

 is an infusion of potato. This is prepared by paring a potato and 

 slicing it into three or four times its bulk of water. This is kept for a 

 couple of hours at about 70° C, by placing it over a water-bath, 

 during which time it is occasionally stirred. It is then filtered, 

 and is read}^ to be placed in the culture vessels for sterilizing and 

 use. If the heat is allowed to rise much above 70°, the starch is 

 gelatinized, and it is only with difficulty that the solution can be 

 filtered. The resulting liquid is clear and watery, but is often 




334 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



light brown from coloring matter contained in the potato, which 

 does not, however, materially interfere with observations on the 

 growth of bacteria in it. Iodine gives a blue coloration to this 

 liquid, showing that it contains starch, probably in the form of 

 amylon. Another equally good culture fluid is made by treating 

 corn (maize) meal in a similar manner. The solution is colorless, 

 but it is very apt to throw down a troublesome sediment, which 

 makes it less desirable to use than the potato solution. 



Test-tube or flask cultures with these liquids, when kept at a 

 temperature of 25° to 30°C., usually show some turbidity in 

 twenty-four hours after being infected, and if the growth is very 

 rapid, bubbles of gas (CO2) will be given oflT, which collect at the 

 surface into a slight froth. In forty-eight hours the liquid has 

 become thoroughly turbid. By this time a thin whitish pellicle 

 has formed on the surface, which does not increase much in thick- 

 ness up to the end of active growth, and rarel}' becomes wrinkled. 

 With the formation of the pellicle, a sediment gathers at the bot- 

 tom of the liquid, often a centimeter in depth, but which is so 

 light that it only apparently difljers from the liquid above by being 

 whiter. In the course of some weeks this sediment will mostly 

 gather upon the bottom of the vessel. No difierence has been 

 observed in the appearance of the bacteria taken from diflferent 

 parts of the culture. Those imbedded in the pellicle are not 

 arranged in any recognizable order. 



In proportion as liquids are less suitable to the growth of 

 the organism, the visible changes are less. The pellicle may not 

 be formed, and there may be no turbidity, but if any growth at 

 all takes place there will be some evidence of it by formation of 

 a slight sediment. But the occurrence of a precipitate does not 

 necessarily imply growth, for it not infrequently separates from 

 a liquid containing organic matter, although remaining perfectly 

 sterile. 



An infusion of hay, and also of dead, partly decomposed 

 grass from a marsh, gave nearly a normal growth of blight 

 bacteria, but the cells were considerably more refractive than 

 usual. 



A solution of starch, having one part of starch to fifty of 

 water, gave but a slight growth of highly refractive bacteria, 

 without a pellicle, turbidity, or zoogloea. A strong decoction of 

 old barnyard manure acted in the same manner. A solution of 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



one part of glucose to fifty of water gave no growth of the 

 bacteria. 



In testing the effect of acids upon the development of blight 

 bacteria, a ^ per cent, of malic acid was added to the usual infu- 

 sion of potato. This prevented the formation of a pellicle, tur- 

 bidity or zoogloea, but gave a very considerable cloudy sediment, 

 largely made up of loosely aggregated groups of blight bacteria, 

 which were brilliantly refractive. A similar solution with 2 per 

 cent, of malic acid gave a slightly less abundant sediment, but with 

 otherwise the same results. Some of the latter was transferred 

 to a corn-meal solution, producing the characteristics of a pear- 

 blight culture, except the formation of zoogloea. After some 

 days this was introduced into a pear tree, which in due course of 

 time gave the true blight, showing that the bacteria of the acid 

 solution were really blight bacteria. Attempts to grow them in 

 a nutrient 5 per cent, solution of citric and tartaric acids have 

 not been successful. 



Testing the nature of the bacteria in cultures producing 

 limited growth, by inoculating directly into the tree, has not, as a 

 rule, proved successful, as for some reason they seem unable to 

 gain a footing in the living tissues. It is therefore necessary to 

 transfer them first to richly nutrient cultures, from which, after 

 a time, they may be introduced into the tree, and, if the blight 

 bacteria are present, will start the disease. 



Cultivation in Solid Media. — In test-tube cultures with nutrient 

 gelatine the most characteristic results have been obtained by 

 adding a drop containing blight bacteria to the gelatine while 

 liquid, and thoroughly distributing the germs by shaking the 

 tube. In from two to three days the gelatine contains numerous 

 small white dots, which, upon examination under the microscope, 

 prove to be a mass of bacteria of the usual appearance. The 

 dots are globular or oval, and increase to about .5 mm. in 

 diameter. No further growth or change takes place, and in this 

 condition they remain for weeks, without liquefying or otherwise 

 affecting the gelatine. 



When sown upon the surface of the gelatine by drawinor a 

 needle or glass rod over it, or by placing a drop on it, the growth 

 is feeble and does not amount to more than a slisfht shinino- 

 appearance of the surface. 



A nutrient solution made from an unripe pear, in which blight 




336 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



germs were well distributed by shaking and then left undis- 

 turbed for two days, gave the same isolated white dots as in 

 gelatine ; but they dropped to the bottom of the liquid upon 

 being jarred. Tiie bacteria were evidently prevented from 

 moving freely by the jelly, which was not, however, thick 

 enough to keep the groups in place when its cohesion was 

 once disturbed. Fruit jellies, doubtless, may be found to be 

 convenient media for the cultivation of this species of bac- 

 teria. 



No success has been attained in the use of agar agar, but 

 whether due to a want of adaptability in the substance, or to 

 wrong manipulation, must be left to future experiments to 

 determine. 



The opaque solid cultures proving most successful have been 

 conducted upon freshly gathered unripe pears. Slices of these 

 are placed under a moist bell-jar, and infected by touching with 

 a needle that has been dipped in some substance containing the 

 bacteria. In two or three days fine milky drops, like beads of 

 dew, will appear scattered over the surface for 5 mm. or more 

 about the infected spot. These will become somewhat larger 

 after a time, while the spot which received the infection will turn 

 slightly brown, the tissues gradually wasting away and forming 

 a small depression. 



If, however, the slices, having freshly cut surfaces both above 

 and below, are laid upon a plate with a little water, and placed 

 under a bell-jar, the result is not the same. The dew-like drops 

 appear within forty-eight hours, as in the other case, but increase 

 rapidly in size, while a drop is also formed at the point of infec- 

 tion. Drops finally appear over the whole surface of the slice. 

 They remain more or less distinct, and soon become as large as 

 a pea, retaining the globular or rounded form to a remarkable 

 degree. Microscopically the^^ are composed of the usual form 

 of blight bacteria, suspended in a colorless fluid. After about a 

 week, the drops coalesce and the tissues of the pear begin to 

 break down. This sort of culture requires no precautions of 

 sterilizing, as no other bacteria can multiply upon it till after the 

 cells of the pear begin to die. 



When blight bacteria are sown upon slices of baked or boiled 

 potato, they spread out over the surface in a thin, slightly moist 

 layer, which is usually somewhat yellowish, but do not grow

readily, or produce a characteristic appearance. Under the 

 microscope the cells are strongly refractive. 



A boiled potato was infected by thrusting a platinum wire, 

 smeared with blight bacteria, into one end. After sixteen days 

 it was cut open. No external change had taken place, and, to 

 the unaided eye, no internal change either; the odor and texture 

 were still those of a freshly boiled potato. The microscope, how- 

 ever, revealed the blight bacteria in every part of the potato, in 

 irregular motionless masses, and with more than the usual 

 refractiveness. 



These opaque solid cultures have brought out one fact very 

 distinctly, which is, that Micrococcus amylovorus requires a 

 large supply of water for its best development — a fact which has 

 an economic bearing. 



Behavior toward Staining Fluids. — So far as trial has been 

 made, nothing especially characteristic has been detected to dis- 

 tingui%h this form of bacteria from the majority of micrococci. 

 The most successful results have been obtained with a watery 

 solution of Bismarck-brown, especiallj'^ in cover-glass prepara- 

 tions. These make excellent specimens when mounted in 

 Canada balsam. 



The zoogloea are inclined to be too deeply stained by this pro- 

 cess, and for most purposes they are best studied unstained. 

 They may be well preserved by mounting in glycerine. 



Htematoxylin has also given good results, but has not been 

 found particularly useful. 



Chemical Pi'oducts. — The chemical changes brought about by 

 the activity of the blight bacteria have not yet been fully and 

 carefully worked out. The most obvious product is carbon 

 dioxide, which often passes off so freely from a cultivation as to 

 produce a slow effervescence. Butyric acid and alcohol are 

 formed in very small quantities, if at all. The tests by which 

 these facts have been determined have already been published,' 

 and need not be repeated here. Vigorous cultures of the bacteria 

 in infusion of potato give no reaction for glucose with Fehling's 

 solution ; and blighting tissues from the tree give no indication 

 b}' the same test of more than the normal amount of glucose to 

 be found in healthy tissues. On the other hand a quantitative

determination of sound and blighting pears, taken from the tre^ 

 at the same time, shows considerably less sugar in the latter. 



A favorite explanation with horticulturists of the action of fire- 

 blight upon the pear-tree, has been to say that the sap is poisoned. 

 This poison was supposed to be introduced by insects, or to be 

 due to some disorganization of the tissues. Although it is now 

 known that specific bacteria are directl}^ answerable for the dis- 

 ease, it is yet worth while to see if the old idea of a poison has 

 not some foundation in fact. 



It has been ascertained that certain bacteria produce, during 

 their growth, characteristic poisons which are classed under the 

 name of ptomaines. Most of the ptomaines are non-volatile, and 

 readily soluble in water or alcohol. The chemical tests which 

 are applied for their detection cannot be considered conclusive 

 except when taken collectively. The tests tried below are among 

 the most satisfactory known at present.^ 



A cultivation in infusion of potato, giving about 200 cc. of liquid 

 was filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to a syrup. This was 

 treated with alcohol, and the solution tested with the most char- 

 acteristic test for ptomaines — the reduction of potassic ferric- 

 cyanide. Other portions of the solution were successively tested 

 with phospho-molybdic acid, potassio-mercuric iodide, and iodine 

 in potassic iodide, all of which failed to give any distinctive 

 reactions. 



Another trial was made with about 200 cc. of material prepared 

 hj cooking a potato in just enough water to cover it, sterilizing, 

 and cultivating the bacteria in it as usual. In four days from 

 beginning of the culture it was filtered ; the residue upon the 

 filter was treated with 100 cc. of distilled water, slightly acidulated 

 with hydrochloric acid, heated to T0°C. and filtered. The two 

 filtrates were united and evaporated to a syrup. This was digested 

 in the cold with alcohol containing a little sodic hydrate. This 

 solution was tested as before, and also with platinic chloride and 

 concentrated sulphuric acid, and all with no distinctive reactions. 



A third trial was made with a boiled potato, which had been 

 permeated with the blight. The extract was made by the Stas- 

 Otto method, and the same reagents used as in the last case, with 

 equally negative results. 



^ Cf. Brieger, Ueber Ptomaine, 1885, p. 22, et seq. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 339 



These tests do not cover the possibility of the ptomaine being 

 volatile, which is really not very great. It is yet necessary to 

 make tests of freshly blighted tissues from the tree, which can 

 only be done during the hot* months. 



Action of the Organism in the Living Plant. — The bacteria of 

 blight have the power of growth and multiplication in the pres- 

 ence of the living cells of the pear, and in this one important 

 respect differ essentially from other species of bacteria. By arti- 

 ficial inoculation into growing unripe pears, which give most 

 marked and certain results, it is found that other bacteria are 

 entirely innocuous, at once disappearing without having made 

 any growth or induced any changes in the tissue of the pear. If 

 blight bacteria in active condition are intermixed with the other 

 forms, they penetrate the cells, multiply, and finally bring about 

 the disorganization and death of the tissues which marks the pro- 

 gress of the disease, but the associated forms disappear the same 

 as when introduced alone, and the product is a mass of practically 

 pure blight bacteria. 



This result is rendered possible on account of the fact already 

 stated, that the blight bacteria penetrate the tissues, and main- 

 tain their normal growth for some time (days or weeks), before 

 the life of the cells is sufficiently interfered with to permit the 

 growth of other forms. The bacteria always extend beyond the 

 visible location of the disease — in small branches, often to the 

 distance of a third of a meter or more. 



One of the properties which enables this species to successfully 

 penetrate the pear-tree is evidently its unusual indifference to 

 acids, which prevents most other forms from making any 

 growth; the juices of the pear give a strong acid reaction with 

 test paper. 



What chemical changes are brought about by its activity in 

 the plant cannot be definitely stated, further than to saj^ that a 

 mucilage or gum, which is soluble in water, is produced in abun- 

 dance, with the disengagement of carbon dioxide. The contents 

 of the cells, together with the cell- walls which have not been 

 liquefied or changed into stony tissue, pass over into this viscous 

 product.^

It was early observed by cultivators, being recorded by Coxe, 

 that succulent shoots blight the most readily, and any process of 

 cultivation which as far as possible prevents succulency has 

 always been considered an aid in keeping the disease in check. 

 The avidity of the blight bacteria for water has been well demon- 

 strated in the cultures on slices of pears. There seems to be 

 some connection between these facts and the well-known fact 

 that the disease shows different degrees of virulence in different 

 varieties of fruit trees, especially in different varieties of the 

 pear. The variation, or at least part of it, to be observed in 

 pears, apples, quinces, hawthorns, etc., may be due to some inhe- 

 rent difference in the nature of the host, not readily formulated ; 

 for we find that the blight bacteria will grow to only a slight 

 extent in the succulent peach shoots, and not at all in most 

 other plants.^ But in varieties of the same fruit it may reason- 

 ably be inferred that to a considerable extent the difference in 

 the progress of the disease is due to physical causes. 



To determine what relation the hydration of the tissues holds 

 to this question, a series of determinations of the percentage of 

 water in the parts of the tree most subject to blight has been 

 begun. These are yet incomplete, and can only now be referred 

 to briefly. 



The Bartlett and Seckel pears very well represent the extremes, 

 the first being most affected by the disease and the second least. 

 Twigs taken from the tree in February were found to contain 50*2 

 per cent, and 50'85 per cent, of water respectively. Twigs taken 

 in the same way April 30, bearing flower buds, but with the 

 leaves removed, gave 68*t per cent, and 6 7 '3 per cent, of water. 

 The half-grown fruit, taken the first week in July, gave '79*3 per 

 cent, of water for the Bartlett and Tt per cent, for the Seckel. 

 According to these figures the amount of water in the Bartlett 

 and Seckel twigs during the winter is practically the same, but 

 during growth both the twigs and fruit of the Bartlett contain 

 more water than those of the Seckel, These numbers give some 

 support to the view that succulency and the strength of the dis- 

 ease are directly related, but the data are yet too incomplete to 

 warrant a definite statement.

Notes on the Lichens in the Herbarium of the Academy. — At a 

 meeting of the Botanical Section, held October 11, Dr. J. W. 

 EcKFELDT, to whom had been committed the task of examining 

 and arranging the Lichens in possession of the Academy, reported 

 the result of his work, which had extended over two years. 

 Besides the collections upon the shelves, made by Schweinitz, and 

 by him bequeathed to the Academy, and that received from the 

 late Prof Tuckerman, he had found stowed away among miscel- 

 laneous packages : 1st, a collection made by Thomas G. Lea, of 

 North American species, many without names, or incorrectly 

 named ; 2d, a small collection made by H. W. Ravenel, chiefly from 

 the vicinity of Aiken, or along the Santee Canal in South Carolina, 

 in all about 60 to 70 species ; 3d, a small collection of Arctic spe- 

 cies made by Dr. Hayes ; 4th, a small collection of European 

 species made by Parmentier at a ver}^ earl}' date ; 5th, a set of 

 Scotch Lichens from Mr. Manghen ; and a few scattered species 

 from various American collectors. To each of these collections 

 he had given a careful microscopic examination, and had named 

 and classified them on the basis of Prof Tuckerman's Genera 

 Lichenum. He had also added to these from his own private 

 herbarium more than 400 species, both North American and 

 foreign. All these collections had been incorporated in one, and 

 occupy one of the cases in the lower room, as a nucleus for the 

 Academy's general collection of Lichens. 



For obvious reasons it had been deemed advisable to maintain 

 apart and undisturbed the type collections of Schweinitz and 

 Tuckerman, but a general catalogue has been prepared including 

 all, by which proper reference to the contents of each is facilitated. 

 He had, moreover, gone carefully through the Schweinitzian col- 

 lection, and, while leaving the original names unchanged, had 

 indicated upon the outside of each packet such changes as are 

 required by the present state of knowledge. 



The total number of species of Lichens now in the Academy's 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



Herbarium is 736. In the general collection are 570 species, and 

 in the Schweinitzian are 462. The general collection contains 

 244 species not found in the Schweinitzian, and the latter has 

 282 sjjecies not found in the former. In all, 65 genera are well 

 represented. 



In regard to the Schweinitzian collection he remarked that the 

 same species often there appeared under several names, being 

 simply in different stages of development. Genera too were 

 founded upon juvenescent stages or gonidial conditions which, from 

 the time of Acharius to that of Schweinitz and later, were con- 

 sidered sufficient to establish generic distinctions. For example, 

 such genera as Leparia, Isidium and Byssus, were then deemed 

 valid, but are now considered to be, some of them young and 

 irioid states of plants mostly belonging to the section Lecanora ; 

 others, sterile states of Omphalaria, Gsenogonia, or other Colle- 

 matous Lichens. 



He spoke of several rare and interesting specimens in the col- 

 lection. Of these, in the Schweinitz Herbarium, is a crustaceous 

 Lichen found in 1812 at Salem, N. C, on a granitic rock, and 

 called by the collector Gyalecta Candida, and by this name known 

 onlj^ to a few up to the year 1866. At this period Prof. Tucker- 

 man described the plant in an Appendix to his Lichens of Cali- 

 fornia as Opegrapha ontocheila, thus placing it permanently in a 

 well-established genus of gvmnocarpous Lichens. This specimen 

 was the only one known until 1885 when Mr. Green found upon high 

 projecting schist rocks along the Catawba River at Landsford, 

 Chester Co., S. C, a lichen which was supposed to be new, until 

 Prof Tuckerman, just previous to his last illness, identified it 

 with that found by Schweinitz as above. Dr. Eckfeldt also re- 

 ferred to a remarkable foliaceous Lichen found near Cincinnati by 

 Mr. T. G. Lea in 1839, formerly known as Farmelia Ohionis (Lea, 

 Catal. PI. Cincinnati, p. 45), but since described by Tuckerman 

 as Physcia Leana. So far as Dr. Eckfeldt was aware, this rare 

 species had not since been found. He also referred to the diffi- 

 culties encountered in the examination of much of the material, 

 many of the types being old and fragile, having lost the parts 

 most important for study, for want of proper care. Only a prac- 

 ticed e} e, aided by constant use of the microscope, and b}'^ com- 

 parison with authentic specimens, can surely determine the doubt- 

 ful and difficult forms present in this section of cryptogamic 

 botany.

On the Interdependence of Plants. — Mr. Thomas Meehan called 

 attention to the well-known fact in geographical botany, that 

 species of plants which once had evidently a wide dispersion now 

 existed only as separate colonies often of a few plants only, the 

 intermediates between these widely separated colonies having 

 evidently disappeared. The cause of these disappearances had 

 not been definitely determined. It was found that the still exist- 

 ing individuals were evidently in good health ; they flowered 

 freely, and perfected seeds, but still the plants did not spread. 

 He gave a number of illustrations within his own observation of 

 a few rare plants that had maintained their existence for over a 

 quarter of a century, with about the same number of individuals 

 now as at the beginning of the term. As the seeding was regular 

 and perfect, why was dispersion arrested ? There could be but 

 one answer. Something prevented the germination of the seeds, 

 or of subsequent growth after germination, 'No doubt there may 

 be other causes, but this one must have a leading influence. 



It then becomes an interesting branch of study to inquire why 

 these seeds do not germinate, and thus aid the plant to recover 

 the ground lost through destructive agencies ? 



An observation extending over about six years led him to con- 

 clude that there was much in the interdependence of plants. What- 

 ever aff"ected the existence of individuals of one species might 

 lead to the extermination of numerous others, and the successful 

 endeavor of one to establish itself in one locality gave the neces- 

 sary opportunity to follow and sustain themselves. This obser- 

 vation was as follows : A wood, chiefly of chestnut and oak, of 

 about an acre in extent, was turned into a picnic ground — a place 

 for summer pleasure parties. All the shrubby undergrowth was 

 cut away. The plants which might have grown up, were kept 

 tolerably well trodden down by the numerous visitors to the 

 wood, except one solitary blackberry plant (Bubus villosus)^ 

 which, being thorny, led to its avoidance by human feet. After 

 the second summer, some change in railroad arrangements led to 

 the abandonment of the wood for picnic purposes, and plants had 

 a chance to grow up again without disturbance from human 

 beings. The blackberry plant, by the aid of its creeping roots 

 now forms a thicket of about thirty feet in diameter. The follow- 

 ing list of plants growing among the blackberries, that were not 

 found in any part of the wood, except the last two, which were 

 in small quantities here and there, was made in October of this 

 year : — 



Eupatorium perfoliatum, liubus occidentalism Liriodendron 

 tulipiferum, Cornus alternifolia^ Smilacina racemosa, Ambrosia 

 artemisisefolia^ Laurus sassafras, Polygonum Persicaria, Achillea 

 millefolium, Solidago canadensis, Mulgedium acuminatum, Bidens 

 frondosa, Silene verticillata, Fragaria virginiana, Aster longi- 

 folia, Eupatorium album, Gircsea lutetiana. Geranium maculatum, 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 345 



Acer ?'ubrnm, Phytolacca decandra, MxMenhergia diffusa, Poten- 

 tilla. canadensis, the last two to some extent in the wood. 



All the kinds, however, grew in the vicinity of the acre of 

 woodland, though not within its limits, and it was easy to note 

 that they had grown from, seeds falling or bi'ought to the black- 

 berry patch during the last three or four years. Those who are 

 fiimiliar with the seeds of these plants will understand that there 

 is nothing special about the seeds of these species that would 

 easily lead to their being brought there by birds that might 

 rendezvous in the thickets. We must look to the wind as the 

 chief agent in transporting them there. This being the case, we 

 should look for the i)lants from wind-sown seeds in other por- 

 tions of the wood, as well as in the blackberry patch. That they 

 are not in the wood elsewhere permits iis to say that the shade, 

 moisture, preservation of decaying leaves, or of some other inci- 

 dent not acceptable to other plants in the wood, but favorable to 

 these strangers, gave them the chance to sprout and grow. 

 They were, in fact, de})endent on the blackberry for their 

 first start in life. This conclusion was further evidenced 

 by the fact that, though some of the annuals had evidently 

 seeded and reproduced plants for several successive seasons, no 

 plants were found spreading out of the protecting area of the 

 blackberry thicket. Certainly these species were all dependent 

 here on this plant, as this plant would probably be dependent on 

 others in some other instances. 



How some plants can exist, grow healthily, produce seed, and 

 not spread, Mr. Meehan illustrated in the case of Shortia galaci- 

 folia, the original locality of Michaux having a few months ago 

 been rediscovered b}^ Professor C. S. Sargent. Though it had 

 maintained itself for the best part of a century, it had existed 

 without spreading. Some circumstance had evidently prevented 

 the seed from germinating, and these circumstances would 

 undoubtedly be controlled by the presence or absence of some 

 friendly plant. He offered the facts as a contribution to the 

 study of the interdependence of plants.

OBSEKVATION ON MULTIPLICATION IN AM(EB^. 

 BY LILLIE E. HOLMAN. 



On the 4th of July, 1886, I was examining the forms of life 

 contained in a Holman life-slide, which had been filled for 

 several hours. It contained different Infusoria, and among 

 other animals, specimens of ^olosoraa. But it seemed for some 

 time as if there were no amoebae in the slide, until I discovered 

 a small one near the channel. In shape it seemed like an elon- 

 gated triangle, and was rather torpid, or at least moved but little. 

 While I was examining it, it moved up closer to the line of the 

 channel, and another amoeba, about twice the size of the first 

 one, came gliding on the scene. It moved up very close to the 

 other, and in a few moments I noticed that it looked as if it were 

 trying to swallow the smaller amoeba, in the same manner that 

 it does its ordinary prey. As I had watched many amoebae and 

 had never seen anything like this, and as I knew that they did 

 not prey on each other, and the question of their conjugation 

 was a very doubtful one, I dismissed the idea of the larger 

 absorbing the smaller, and concluded it was merely the fact that 

 they were in too tight a place to allow of their passing each other 

 which gave them this appearance. I watched them constantly 

 for about half an hour, in course of which time I became con- 

 vinced that something unusual was going on. 



The larger amoeba had entirely surrounded the smaller one, 

 which, however, did not seem to lose its vitalit3\ First it seemed 

 to be under the endosarc of the larger, and then above it. 

 Sometimes it would project a pseudopod out from beyond the 

 ectosarc of the larger animal. All the time it was distinctly 

 visible in its own individuality, if one maj' so call it, and did not 

 at all seem to be trying to escape, I called Mr. Holman's atten- 

 tion to the singularity of their behavior, and expressed my 

 belief that it was a case of either cannibalism or conjugation. 

 He expressed his disbelief in either of these cases, and observ- 

 ing that the water in the slide was evaporating, we allowed a 

 little to creep in under the closed edge of the cover-glass. This 

 seemed to relieve the large amoeba from the constrained position 

 and flat contour which it had assumed, and it immediately com- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 347 



menced to put out pseudopods and move away ; and the smaller 

 one moved off with it, evidently engulfed in the larger one, and 

 quiescent in that position. 



The small amoeba occupied a position in the upper part of 

 the larger one. As tliis last moved on, it seemed to push 

 the small one in an opposite direction from that which its gran- 

 ules were taking, till it reached about the centre of its bod}'. 

 Then it commenced an evident effort to expel the smaller one. 

 It reached out its pseudopods in every direction, gradually- ex- 

 pelling the smaller one until it was completely discharged. The 

 smaller one, by this time, assumed an almost spherical shape. 



At last the large amoeba ceased moving, and commenced to 

 expel refuse matter such as is common with them. It had 

 anchored itself near some other refuse matter, probably vege- 

 table, and really looked as if it was using it as a sort of grapple 

 for the purpose of ridding itself of the rejected smaller amoeba. 

 It was successful ; for in a few moments it moved away to the 

 upper part of the field, leaving the round ball, looking in every 

 respect like an encysted amoeba, near the little group of refuse. 

 It went on in the field, and we followed it for some time, when it 

 became quiet, and we went back to the encysted one. I watched 

 it to see what would happen next, for it seemed as if there must 

 be some strange sequel to our remarkable obserA'ation, and the 

 watching was not in vain. The flat disk commenced by a sort 

 of contractile movement, to throw out particles or granules, as if 

 it were laying eggs. I can think of no other expression, although 

 the particles, while approximate in size, had no regularity of 

 shape. This continued till the amoeba again assumed its clear 

 and transparent appearance, and at last, seeming to fully regain 

 its activity, put out a pseudopod and moved in the field, leaving 

 behind it a group of the particles or granules. Only for a little 

 while, however, did it move ; in a few moments it lost its anima- 

 tion, seemed to become transparent, and at last faded into one of 

 those disks which seem to be merely the shells of once active 

 forms. I did not see it move again. 



This observation was carried on continuously during two 

 hours and a half, and every stage watched most closely. I was 

 at a loss what to call it, if not a clear case of conjugation and 

 separation. 




348 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



The most convincing proof to my mind that this was a pro- 

 ceeding which was for a purpose, was given when, two nights 

 after, this slide, which was laid carefully aside for future exami- 

 nation, was found to be full of young amoebae. They literally 

 swarmed ; I counted in the field at one time twenty-four of uni- 

 form size, while I have no hesitation in saying that there were 

 between one and two hundred in the slide, which had before held 

 but two. The worn-out disc was recoguized, and also what 

 seemed to be the remains of the larger arao3ba.

On Petiolar Glands in some Onagracese. — Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 remarked that stipules were unknown in Onagracese^ but in Lud- 

 wigia (Isnardia) palustris there were two minute conical gelatin- 

 ous orlands that appeared to be stipular. They existed in series of 

 specimens representing the Atlantic and Pacific coast, and from 

 Europe, those from California being larger than in specimens 

 from other locations. The}^ are found in all the species of Lud- 

 wigia and Jussieua that he had been able to examine. In these 

 they appeared petiolar rather than stipular. In the dried speci- 

 mens of Circsea a dark spot indicated the position occupied by 

 the glands in other species. They mostly varied in form and 

 exact position with the species, and only for having been wholly 

 overlooked by describers might have aff'orded some good specific 

 characters. The discovery he regarded as interesting, as con- 

 firming the views of those botanists who had brought Turnera- 

 ceae, in which the petiolar glands were known to exist, in close 

 relation with Onagracese.

Manganese Zinc Serpentine from Franklin^ N. J. — Prof. 

 George A. Koenig placed on record the determination of a man- 

 ganese zinc serpentine from Franklin, N. J. The material was 

 collected in summer, 1885, as a very peculiar Willemite^ so called 

 at the mine. It is a yqyj compact mineral substance, having a 

 dark brown dull color and subconchoidal fracture, the splinters 

 resembling horn chips. It is translucent on the edges, and when 

 ground into a thin plate transmits a uniform brown-yellow light. 

 Under the microscope this section of the purest material shows 

 strings of minute black grains. Between two crossed nicol 

 prisms the section appears light, proving a crj'-stalline structure 

 other than isometric. But a few grains, a light yellow in ordi- 

 nary light, behave like an isometric substance, and are probably 

 grains of yellow garnet, which is one of the associate minerals. 

 Spec. gr. = 2-63.5. It is decomposed by sulphuric acid like 

 Serpentine.

Under the circumstances, that is, in view of the microscope 

 showing the admixture of an isometric or amorphous body, this 

 ratio is sufficient to establish the material as a Serpentine. 



Associated with the Serpentine, besides the minerals already 

 mentioned, is a light grayish fibrous mineral. This is composed 

 of Calcite and two Silicates, a silicate decomposable by Hcl 

 (probabl}' equal to the above serpentine), and a silicate insoluble 

 in Hcl, which is probably a pj-roxene. Several analyses have 

 been made without establishing the nature satisfactorily. 



On Miocene Fossils from Southern New Jersey. — Prof. Heilprin 

 called attention to a limited collection of fossils from near Bridge- 

 ton and Jericho, Cumberland Co., New Jersej^ representing the 

 Miocene formation of that State. The species identified were : 

 Terebra curvilirata, Turritella aeqnislriata, Turritella Gumber- 

 landia, Trochita centralis^ Fissurella Griscomi, Chama congre- 

 gata, Astarte disfans (xindulata)^ Grassatella mehna, Area cen- 

 tenaria^ Nucula obliqua (proxima).i Perna maxillata, Pecten 

 Madisonius, Pecten sp. ? Orbicula lugiibris. 



A number of these forms — nearly one-half — had not been 

 identified in the State before, although fairly abundant in the 

 Miocene tract of the region to the south. They are therefore 

 interesting as bearing directl}' upon the question of horizon 

 which the scantily-represented Miocene fauna of New Jersey 

 indicates. The speaker stated that in his work, " Contributions 

 to the Tertiary Geology and Paleontology of the United States" 

 (1884), he had suggested that the probable position of the 

 deposits in question would be found to be in the " Marylandian " 

 series — Lower Atlantic Miocene — a view sustained by the addi- 

 tional fossils that have now been brought to light. 



On the Helictites of Luray Cave. — Dr. Charles S. Dolley 

 remarked that during a recent visit to the celebrated Luray 

 Caverns his attention was called to the peculiar branching stalac- 

 tites known as helictites (e'/.'r, a spiral), and the question arose as 

 to the metliod by which a stalactite gives oflf a horizontal branch 

 at right angles ; this branch in its turn perhaps sending out twigs 

 at greater or lesser angles, and at var^'ing degrees of inclination. 



For a better opportunity of studying this interesting phe- 

 nomenon he was permitted to visit in company with Dr. Leidy a 

 chamber seldom opened to inspection, and which, from the deli- 

 cate and fantastic character of its limy deposits, has been called 

 the " Toy Shop." Here the stalactites were found to be of very 

 recent formation, small, hollow, and increasing rapidly. Many 

 branching specimens, or helictites, in all stages of growth, were 

 to be seen. After some time spent in a vain search for an expla- 

 nation of this anomalous structure, he happened to notice two 

 specimens, the incipient branches of which were directed towards 

 each other ; stretched tightly between the branches, and entering 




362 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



the hollow tip of each, was a delicate thread, bearing a string of 

 dew-like drops glistening brightly in the candle-light. Further 

 search revealed numerous specimens in which the lime-water 

 trickling down the stalactite met a similar filament, and being 

 partially diverted had formed a drop at the point of junction; 

 about this drop beautiful aragonite spicules were forming the 

 hollow horizontal branch, the drop of water in the end being 

 retained in position by the filament piercing it, and upon which 

 it is gradually pushed along as evaporation deposits the lime 

 behind it. The length of the branch depends, of course, upon 

 the length of time in which the filament remains intact. 



These filaments, which are thus seen to be the cause of the 

 formation of lateral offshoots to stalactites, are the products of a 

 small cave spider.

On Hsematoxylin in the Bark of Saraca Inclica. — Miss Helen 

 C. De S. Abbott stated that De CandoUe ^ and Linnaeus describe 

 Saraca Indica as a member of the famil}' Leguminosse. Accord- 

 ing to De Candolle it belongs to the genus Jonesia^ Saraca Linn., 

 and is separated by five genera from the genus Esematoxylon or 

 the logwood. 



In an article on certain drugs indigenous to India, Dr. Waring^ 

 gives an account of the medicinal uses of the bark of Saraca 

 Indica. The attention of Messrs. Parke, Davis & Co., Detroit, 

 Michigan, was called to this drug, and through their correspond- 

 ents in India they secured a supply, samples of which have been 

 submitted to the speaker for a chemical analysis. The full 

 results of this analysis will appear elsewhere, but it is now 

 desired to announce a discovery of practical and scientific 

 interest in this connection. 



A coloring principle, identical with logwood dye, has been 

 isolated by her from the bark of Saraca Indica, where it existed 

 in two conditions, as ha^matoxylin and an oxidized product. 

 The former was separated as yellow crj^stals, analogous in form 

 to haematoxylin crystals from the true logwood, Hsematoxijlon 

 campechianam. The alcoholic extract of the bark contained 

 about 18 per cent, of a red colored substance, which agreed in 

 color and dye tests with a like constituent found in logwood.

Mordanted cotton fabric was dyed with haematoxylin, extracted 

 by ether from the Saraca bark, and presented the characteristic 

 logwood dye colors. 



The following is a table of dye wood colors with reagents, 

 yielded by Brazil wood and logwood :^ 



The extracts of Saraca Indica bark, containing the coloring 

 principle, were tested with these reagents, and it was observed 

 that the reactions agreed with the haematoxylin colors, and in no 

 case with those of brasilin. However, the colors produced by 

 different alkalies varied in tints as she had found in both the 

 logwood and Saraca extracts, but the general term " reddish 

 purple solution " is comprehensive. A rose-violet precipitate 

 was yielded by stannous chloride solution with the neutralized 

 acidified extracts of the barks. 



The bark of the logwood-tree is not used for making the com- 

 mercial logwood extracts, the wood of the tree being employed 

 for this purpose. The presence of a small quantity of hseraa- 

 toxj^lin was determined in the specimens of logwood-bark which 

 she examined, and with the bark extracts the same reactions with 

 reagents were obtained as with the logwood extracts, but owing 

 to the smaller percentage of dye in the bark the colors were less 

 intense. In the case of the Saraca Indica bark the colors were 

 very brilliant and indicated the presence of a larger proportion of 

 the coloring matter than in the logwood bark. These results 

 should encourage investigators to secure specimens of the wood 

 of the Saraca^ in order to determine if it contains the coloring 

 principle, and should this be ascertained affirmatively, whether it 

 exists in sufficiently large quantities to warrant its introduction 

 as a new source of this commercial product.

logwood bark and Saraca Indica bark, the powdered material 

 was macerated over the water-bath with distilled or filtered river 

 water acidulated with dilute sulphuric acid (1 part to 50), the ex- 

 tract was filtered and the process repeated until no more color 

 was removed. This extract was treated directly with the reagents. 

 Excess of reagents produced darker tints, and after a time the 

 solutions were decolorized. 



Among other constituents contained in the Saraca bark, catechin 

 and saponin were determined. Their presence along with hsema- 

 toxylin is significant as showing the chemical position of Saraca 

 in relation to the genera Acacia and Esematoxylon ; catechin and 

 saponin being found, as is well known, in Acacia. The evolutionary 

 position of the order Leguminosse, to which these genera belong, 

 was pointed out in a former paper, ^ and it was stated that all 

 orders containing saponin came under the middle division of M. 

 Heckel's botanical scheme,^ or multiplicity of floral elements. 

 The facts accumulated from recent researches, since the publica- 

 tion of her article in the Botanical Gazette, and the discovery 

 of saponin in many plants of widely different genera and families, 

 seem to justify and confirm what was stated in the article 

 referred to above, " saponin is invariably absent where the floral 

 elements are simple ; it is invariabl}- absent where the floral 

 elements are condensed to their greatest extent. Its position is 

 plainly that of a factor in the great middle realm of plant life 

 when the elements of the individual are striving to condense, and 

 thus increase their physiological action and the economj' of parts.''^

ON SCHOELOMITE AS A VAEIETY OF MELANITE. 

 BY GEO. A. KOENIG, PH. D. 



On the basis of a titanium, Melanite from a new locality in 

 Southwestern Colorado, the hypothesis is proposed that Schor- 

 lomite from Magnet Cove, Arkansas, may be considered as a 

 Melanite in which Titanium replaces both Silicon and Aluminum. 

 By a series of analyses of Schorlomite and Melanite, it is pro- 

 posed to establish the above hj'-pothesis beyond doubt. The 

 following results are merely given as preliminary information. 



The material from Colorado, obtained through Moritz Stockder, 

 Mining Engineer at Lake City, shows the Melanite as black 

 masses imbedded in a greenish yellow, fine granular matrix, with 

 undefined boundaries. No crystal planes were observed. The 

 color is deep black, brownish at thin edges, and in thin plates. 

 It has an uneven fracture, rather resinous lustre. Sp. gr. = 3*689. 



Thin sections under microscope show the homogeneous charac- 

 ter and optical indifference of the substance.

 bubbles (CO^). Hydrochloric acid decomposes the mineral very 

 slowly. The analysis gave in two determinations :

AP03 = 2-26 



Fe^O^ = 22-67 



CaO =34-29 



MgO = 0-304 



C02 = 1-48 (loss by fusion).

0*5 gr. decomposed in sealed tube required 2*2 cc. of per- 

 manganate (titre = 0-0058 Fe). TiO^ + APO^ were separated 

 from Fe^O^ by (NH^)-S in tartaric solution, and APO^ from TiO^ 

 by acetic acid according to Gooch. 



Assuming that Ti replaces Si the ratio is obtained (Si, Ti)02 : 

 (Fe, AiyO^ : CaO = 3-728 : 1 : 3-49. But assuming that Ti re- 

 places the sesquioxides in part as Ti^O"* under the hypothesis that 

 the permanganate was reduced by Ti^O^ we obtain 3-28 Ti-0^ as 

 replacing alumina := 3-64 TiO^ It having been ascertained that

the loss by ignition is owing to CO^ and not to water, its equiva- 

 lent of CaO was subtracted. Thus corrected the composition of 

 the mineral is :

 MgO = 1-22 : 40 = 0-030 > 0-597 

 MnO = 0-46 : 71 =0-006 j 



99-98 

 This gives the ratio — 



(Si, Ti)02 : (Fe, Ti, A\yO^ : (Ca, Mg, Mn)0 

 3-16 1 : 3-22 



While not so near to the normal ratio, it is near enough, espe- 

 cially considering the difficulty of estimating Ti"0^, in warranting 

 the hypothesis that Schorlomite has the formula of garnet, is 

 isomorphous with it, and exists, as the writer hopes to establish, 

 in a complete series of intermediate members; so much so, that 

 it will be impossible to say where Melanite stops and Schorlomite 

 begins, even though every titanium Melanite be not called Schor- 

 lomite.

OBSERVATIONS UPON THE UPPER TRIASSIC MAMMALS, DROMATHE- 

 RIUM AND MICROCONODON. 



BY HENRY F. OSBORN, SC. D. 



In 185t Prof. Emmons ^ described portions of three small mam- 

 malian jaws from the Upper Triassic (Chatham Coal Fields) of 

 North Carolina, which he assigned to the new genus Dromathe- 

 rium. The type-specimen is now in the Geological Museum of 

 Williams College. Another specimen is in the collection of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. I cannot ascertain 

 the whereabouts of the third fragmentary specimen mentioned by 

 the author. I am indebted to Prof. Samuel F. Clarke, of Williams 

 College, for an opportunity of studying the type specimen. 

 Although slightly injured in the original removal of the matrix, 

 this fossil is in beautiful preservation, and gives the complete 

 mandibular dentition, with the exception of two molar crowns. I 

 soon observed that my drawing, made under a camera, did not

agree with that given by Emmons, in his American Geology, Part 

 VI, p. 94, which has since been copied by Owen, Dana and others. 

 This discrepancy was apparently explained later by a comparison 

 of the Williams College specimen with that in the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In the latter, although the 

 mandible is nearly complete, two molars and two premolars only 

 are preserved, but these indicate a distinct genus. As Emmons 

 referred both jaws to the same genus, it is not unlikely that he 

 supplemented the rather obscure characters of the teeth in his 

 type-specimen with the very obvious tooth patterns of the less 

 perfect specimen. Thus, while the number of the molars in 

 Emmons' drawing follows the type-specimen, their form resem- 

 bles that observed in the Microconodon molars, which will pre- 

 sently be described. 



Those familiar with the works of Professors Owen and Marsh 

 upon the Mesozoic mammalia are aware that sharp distinctions

in the molar series of the mammals of this period do not exist. 

 That is, the only distinction drawn between molars and premolars 

 is one of form ; we have no data as to permanent and deciduous 

 dentition, except possibly in the genus Triconodon. The rule 

 adopted is that, where the post-canine teeth are not all alike, the 

 series of like form following the canine are called premolars ; 

 and those behind these, of another form, are called molars. 

 This rule has been applied to all genera, excepting Phascolo- 

 therium and Diplocynodon, where all the post-canine teeth are 

 practically alike. 



DROMATHERITIM.

Generic Characters. — Incisors and canines erect. Molars and

high, styloid and procumbent, with no cingulum and probably 

 single fanged. Molars bifanged with high pointed crowns and 

 minute sometimes bifid cusps on the anterior slope and distinct 

 pointed cusps on the posterior slopes. The dental formula is 



C. 



Pm. 



M. 



The incisors are nearly erect, and are separated by interspaces 

 equaling the diameter of their crowns, which indicates that the 

 superior incisors interlocked with them. Ii is low and small ; I2 

 is larger and more erect ; I3 is very high, slender and slightly 

 recurved, resembling the canine. The canine is tall, stout and 

 recurved, and in form is similar to the canine of Peralestes. 

 There is no indication of a double fang. A wide diastema sep- 

 arates this tooth from the premolars. These teeth are styloid 

 in shape, and strongly procumbent. The two anterior are appar-

eiitlj supported on single fangs. The crowns are subcylindrical, 

 with obtuse tips. The third premolar is larger, more tapering 

 from base to summit, and has an indication of a double fang. 

 The first molar in general outline is transitional between the 

 molars and premolars. On the anterior slope of the main cone, 

 near the summit, is a fine accessory cusp ; while near the base of 

 the posterior slope is a more distinct cusp. The second molar 

 has two accessory cusps on the anterior slope of the main cone, 

 and one on the posterior slope placed half way down. The 

 third molar differs from the others in the large size of the poste- 

 rior cusp. On the anterior slope there is an indication of a 

 small accessory cusp. In the fourth molar the crown tip is de- 

 tached, but there is an indication of the usual anterior and posterior 

 accessory cusps. The fifth molar, besides the anterior and poste- 

 rior cusps, has the trace of a posterior cingulum and possibly of a 

 postero-external cusp. The sixth molar is like the fourth. The 

 seventh molar is the most complex tooth in the series ; like the 

 second, it has two accessory cusps on the anterior slope of the 

 main cone, the uppermost of which is distinctly bifid. The 

 posterior slope also has a bifid accessory cusp, and a faint basal 

 cingulum. The anterior cusps throughout rise like needle-points 

 on the sides of the teeth ; the posterior cusps are more distinct. 

 All the molars are compactly placed with high, rather narrow 

 crowns, and deep depressions above the double fangs. The char- 

 acters of these crowns were made out with the greatest diflSculty, 

 and a more perfect specimen may show slight diflerence of 

 detail. 



The mandible of Dromatherium is heavy and well-rounded in 

 section. It is marked on its inner face by a deep myloh^'oid 

 groove, widening posteriorly into a broad pterygoid fossa. 

 The upper border rises behind the molars into the coronoid pro- 

 cess, cr. The summit of this process is broken, but a faint impres- 

 sion on the matrix shows that it had a high, slightly recurved 

 outline. A small portion of the hind border seems to be pre- 

 served just above the angle which would indicate that the condyle, 

 en, was placed midwa}^ between the coronoid and angle, somewhat 

 as in Amhlotherium. The thick lower border has a gentle double 

 curvature. There is no trace of the symphj^sial surface. 



The unique character of the dentition separates Dromatherium 

 widely from any known fossil or recent genus.

MICROCONODON. 

 SHcroconodon tenuirostris, gen. et sp. nov. 



This genus is founded upon the specimen in the collection of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, which was 

 described by Emmons as Dromatherium. 



Generic Characters. — A wide diastema between the canine 

 and first premolar. Molars and premolars unlike. Premolars 

 simple, erect cones with a faint posterior cingulum and partly 

 bi-fanged. Molars bi-fanged with broad crowns supporting a large 

 median cusp, at the sides of which are anterior and posterior 

 conical cusps, sub-equal in size, and a distinct posterior cingulum. 



The ramus is about two-thirds the length of that of Droma- 

 therium. Its general lower curvature is single. There is a de- 

 pression extending beneath the molar-premolar series, but this is 

 shallower than the mylohyoid groove, and I infer that the outer

surface of the jaw is the one exposed. The coronoid rises by a 

 gentle curvature above the molars and the fractured portion seems 

 to have left a faint impression on the matrix, which indicates a 

 low rounded contour. The posterior half of the lower border is 

 marked by a downward process, somewhat similar to that in 

 Peramus. The surface of the process bears a shallow fossa. 

 Above this the crotaphyte fossa is faintly marked. The sym- 

 physial portion of the jaw is partly fractured. The matrix bears 

 an impression which may have been left by a tooth, but more 

 probably is accidental. Altogether, the delicate character of this 

 ramus indicates an animal of feebler masticating power than Dro- 

 matherium, 



The molars probably extended backward to the rise of the 

 upper border. If so, the molar-premolar series covered a greater 

 proportional space than those of Dromatherium. This arose 

 from the comparatively broader crowns of the molars. By 

 analogy with several other Mesozoic genera, we may suppose 

 that the foremost molar preserved is the second, and that behind 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 36§ 



the liindermost were two other molars. This would give four 

 preraolars and six molars. Or there may have been three pre- 

 molars and seven molars as in Dromatherium. Unfortunately no 

 casts are preserved to settle this point, and the restoration of the 

 missing teeth is purely conjectural. 



The molars are somewhat like those of Amphitherium except 

 that the crowns are higher and the anterior and posterior cusps 

 arise from the sides of the main cusp instead of from the base of the 

 crown. The posterior basal cusp which may be the continuation of 

 an internal cingulum is well marked, as is the depression between 

 the two fangs. The third premolar is much larger than the 

 first, and has an indication of two fangs. There is a trace of 

 the fang of the intermediate premolar. These teeth, unlike 

 those of Dromatherium, are erect and do not rise to the level of 

 the molar crowns. The simple premolars differentiate the genus 

 from Amphitherium.

A Neio Species of Ai^lysia. — Prof. Heilprin exhibited speci- 

 mens of a new species of Aplysia, or sea-hare, from Little Gas- 

 parilla Bay, west coast of Florida. The animal in general 

 appearance was probably most nearly related to the European A. 

 depilans (leporina), but differed in several well-marked points of 

 structure, notably in color, the position of the buccal aperture, 

 and in the character of the pore connecting with the shell cavity. 

 While in A. depilans the mouth is placed beneath the tentacular 

 lobes — i. e., the latter are superior — in the Florida species it is 

 central with regard to these organs, the lobes being circumferen- 

 tially connate, and completely encircling the aperture. The pore 

 leading to the shell-sac is minute, and raised on a small papilla; 

 the stellate markings radiating from the base of the papilla are 

 very feeble, and can barely be discerned without close examina- 

 tion. The shell, which is about an inch and three-quarters in 

 length, is horny-calcareous, deeply emarginate, and striated 

 longitudinally and transversely. General color of the animal 

 sea-green, tinged with purple, and irregularly blotched and 

 speckled with spots of lighter color. Length, 7-8 inches. The 

 animal emits a brilliant crimson fluid. It was proposed to name 

 the species Aplysia Willcoxi.

 a well-recognized reputation as a student of conchology, botany, 

 and horticulture, the latter years of his life having been devoted 

 to the last-named pursuit. He was one of the founders of the Con- 

 chological Section of the Academy, and was for years associated 

 with it as a member. 



The collection now given to the Academy is to be known by 

 his name, but no other condition accompanies the generous gift. 

 A valuable portion of the collection consists of the cabinet of 

 the late Mr. Thomas Bland, including his types of "West Indian

shells. By this valuable accession about five thousand species of 

 shells represented by perhaps thirty-five thousand specimens 

 have been added to the already unrivaled Conchological cabinet 

 of the Academy.

ON AN UNDESCRIBED METEORIC IRON FROM EAST TENNESSEE. 

 Plates IV and V. 



BY P. A. GENTH. 



The history of this interesting meteoric iron is very meagre. 

 In August, 1867, 1 received from the late Dr. Isaac Lea a small 

 fragment, weighing about five grams, with the request to deter- 

 mine whether or not it was meteoric iron. The analysis (1), 

 finished August 11, 1861, proving it to be meteoric iron, induced 

 Dr. Lea to purchase the specimen. 



Under date of May 11, 1868, the late Julias E. Raht, of Cleve- 

 land, Tenn., wrote me : " I send you to-day a small piece (it 

 weighed 44 grams. — F. A. G.) of meteoric iron, which was broken 

 off from a mass, weighing fifty pounds, which fell about eight 

 3'^ears ago near the State line of Georgia, ten miles from here 

 (Cleveland, Tenn.). The piece has been sold into Mississippi." 



In the fall of the year 1868, the late Dr. James L. Smith, of 

 Louisville, Ky., the celebrated investigator of meteorites, on his 

 return from Europe, wrote to Dr. Isaac Lea, congratulating him 

 on the acquisition of the Mississippi meteorite, regretting at the 

 same time that his absence in Europe had prevented him from 

 securing it for his own cabinet. 



It now remained in the possession of Dr. Lea, until he presented 

 it to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Pliiladelphia. The 

 Museum record of the Academy simply notes the date of its 

 reception, on October 24, 1876, that it was from the mountains 

 of East Tennessee, and that it weighed 254 pounds. All my 

 efforts to obtain fuller information about its fall and discovery 

 have proved unsuccessful. 



The discrepancy between the weight given by Mr. Raht and 

 the actual weight of the mass, must be charged to incorrect 

 information received by Mr. Raht; this is insignificant, however, 

 compared with the proof which Dr. Smith's letter gives to the 

 fact that his Mississippi meteorite is identical with the one which 

 Mr. Raht stated to have been sold into that State. 



The mass shows on one corner the place where the 44 grams 

 which Mr. Raht sent me had been broken off. 



It is an irregularly shaped, somewhat triangular mass, the 

 largest diameter being about 45 cm., the height about 40 cm. and 

 its greatest thickness about 22 cm.

Its crust is very thin and mostly free from rust, only here and 

 there covered with small spots of the same. It shows one fracture, 

 which, however, cannot be seen on the photographic representa- 

 tion on Plate IV, as it is on the opposite side near the indentation, 

 and extending for about 15 cm. ; its widest part is about 10 mm. 

 in size. 



This meteoric iron appears to be an original whole mass, and 

 not a fragment torn off from a larger one ; its surface is pitted 

 all over and shows numerous depressions and excavations, from 

 a few centimetres in diameter and depth to about 15 cm. in length, 

 8 cm. in width and nearly 5 cm. in depth. The photograph shows 

 beautifully the pitted appearance of the mass. 



Its original weight was nearly 115'5 kilos.; probably 2'5 kilos, 

 have been cut off in slabs which have been distributed amongst 

 learned societies and individuals. 



The crystalline structure of this meteorite i^ beautifully shown 

 on three etched slabs which are represented in their natural size 

 on Plate Y, 1 from my cabinet, 2 in the Vaux Collection, and 3 in 

 the general collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences. All 

 three show the very perfect octahedral structure of this meteorite. 

 The specimen presented to me by Mr. Raht gave on etching 

 exactly the same crystalline structure, which adds another proof 

 that both came from the same piece. 



The usual constituents of this class of meteorites are quite 

 perceptible : the Kamacite (Balkeneisen) largely predominating 

 and forming bands from 1 to 3 mm. in width. The Taenite 

 (Bandeisen) enveloping the Kamacite, frequently subdividing in 

 narrow lines the broader bands of the latter. The length of the 

 Kamacite individuals is from 1-5 cm. to 2 cm. It has a dull gray 

 color ; when magnified, it can be seen to be intersected in every 

 direction by very fine lines, probably of Schreibersite. The Pies- 

 site, somewhat darker than the Kamacite, mostly shows a very 

 fine crystalline, mottled structure (moire metallique) and a 

 glittering lustre ; a small portion, however, is quite dull and 

 much darker. 



On my specimen, fig. 1, Plate Y, there is in two places a remark- 

 able admixture of an iron which is a great deal smoother and 

 hardly shows any crystalline structure. One begins about 9 mm. 

 below the right-hand corner, first forming a somewhat oval mass 

 of 2 to 3 mm. in diameter and then extending in a dagger-shaped 




368 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [1886. 



form for T mm. ; the other is 15 mm. from the right edge and 8 or 

 9 mm. below the border, about 12 mm. long, on both ends 1'5 mm. 

 and in the centre about 1 mm. wide. This iron is brighter than 

 any other portion of the edged surface and has a slightly 3'ellow- 

 ish hue. The patches are not perfectly smooth, however, but 

 show many very minute depressions. In the centre where this 

 iron is narrowest and on some portion of the unetched surface of 

 my slab, small spots of rust have made their appearance. An 

 examination proved the presence of considerable quantity of 

 chlorine, from which it is evident that they are the result of the 

 oxidation of ferrous chloride, which this meteorite contains in 

 small quantities. 



The so-called " alteration zone " next to the hrandrind is quite 

 distinct and from 1 to 1'5 mm. in width. 



I have made three analyses of this meteoric iron, the first nearly 

 twenty years ago, of the slightly rusty fragment, sent by Dr. Lea 

 (1), the second of a perfectly fresh fragment of that portion cut 

 off for specimens (2), and the third of the carefully purified saw- 

 dust obtained by this operation, which represents the average 

 composition of the whole mass where it was cut (3). 



They gave the following results :

370 IPROCEEBINGS OF THE ACADEMY Of [1886. 



At the meeting held June 22, the Academj', by resolution, 

 joined with other scientific societies in an invitation to the 

 International Congress of Geologists, to hold in America, the 

 meeting after that provided for in London. 



On November 2, a committee consisting of Messrs. U. C. Smith, 

 Thos. Meehan, Angelo Heilprin, Rev, Henry C. McCook and 

 T. D. Rand, was appointed to solicit aid from the Legislature 

 in the erection of an addition to the present building. No result 

 has as yet been reported to the Academy. 



All of which is respectfully submitted. 



Edw. J. Nolan, 



Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



During the year the duties of the Corresponding Secretary 

 have been unusually light, and have consisted in great part of 

 the reception of acknowledgments from corresponding societies 

 of publications sent by us and the usual letters of transmittal 

 from them. As many of our exchanges are now sent through 

 the mail, the acknowledgments are in the form of postal cards, 

 which indicate by their dates how much earlier our publications 

 are brought to the notice of the scientific world. 



The four corresponding members elected during the year have 

 been promptl}' notified, and letters in return have been received 

 from them and read to the Academy. 



The donations to the Museum have been many and important, 

 as will appear in the Curators' report. It is one of the duties 

 of my oflSce to send receipts for these, but to the Curator-in- 

 charge I must acknowledge my indebtedness for the fulfillment 

 of a duty of which I ofl^icially know nothing, having merely affixed 

 my signature in former years. 



Very little correspondence of a miscellaneous nature has been 

 received, the Bureau of Scientific Information having apparently 

 been communicated with directly. 



Acknowledgments of the receipt of our publications have 

 been received by postal card, in total, 56 ; representing foreign 

 societies, etc., 12 ; American, 15 ; Canadian, 3.

It will be seen from the above summary that our main depend- 

 ence for increase during the jear has been, as heretofore, upon 

 our exchanges and the I. Y. Williamson Fund. 



Through the kindness of friends of the Academy I have been 

 again enabled to avail myself of the assistance of Sig. Emanuele 

 Fronani during the four months from June 14 to October 14, 

 inclusive. Besides helping me with the routine work of the 

 Library, especially during my vacation, he has completed the 

 copying of more than half of the card catalogue. This work 

 has progressed slowly, as it is only during the engagement of 

 the assistant that time can be devoted to it. It is, however, 

 desirable that means should be provided for placing the cards 

 now prepared at the service of those using the Library. 

 Additional cases for the reception of journals, also, are now 

 absolutely necessary, and it is hoped that an appropriation may 

 be made early in the year for their erection. No other depart- 

 ment of the Library grows so rapidly, and it is impossible to 

 maintain the geographical arrangement which has been found 

 convenient without more room. 



For the reason that I have had to refer to so often before. 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 373 



namely, lack of funds, I have been able to have but 168 volumes 

 bound since the last report. These have been for the most part 

 Williamson books, the work being paid for from the I. V. Wil- 

 liamson fund. Nearly all our exchanges and accumulated pam- 

 phlets remain unbound, thereby not only exposing the Library to 

 loss, but causing serious inconvenience to readers and students. 

 A liberal appropriation for binding, therefore, is one of our 

 immediate and pressing needs. It will be seen by the accompany- 

 ing list of journals and periodicals received, that our exchanges 

 have been kept up and increased. The applications made for 

 deficiencies last year have been productive of their full result, 

 and the gaps still existing will probabl}^ have to be supplied by 

 purchase. 



The shelf list begun last year has been carried forward as 

 rapidly as my other duties would permit. Four or five sections 

 of the Library yet remain to be included, but even in its incom- 

 plete condition the catalogue has proved useful in locating 

 accessions, detecting displacements and facilitating reference to 

 the shelves. 



All of which is respectfully submitted. 



Edw. J. Nolan, 

 Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Curators present the following statement of the Curator- 

 in-Charge, as their I'eport for the year 1886 : — 



The Curator-in-Charge respectfully reports that during the 

 past year the work of arranging, classifying and preserving 

 the collections of the Academy has made considerable progress, 

 for which, as heretofore, the institution is largely indebted to 

 volunteer labor. The special thanks of the Academy are due to 

 Mr. George W. .Tr3^on, Jr., Conservator of the Conchological 

 Collections, to Mr. John H. Redfield, Curator of the Herbarium, 

 and to Mr. Jacob Binder, Curator of the Collection of Minerals 

 covered by the Wm. S. Yaux Trust, for their disinterested labors 

 in their several departments. To the Entomological Section, 

 likewise, acknowledgment is due for work done in connection 

 with the caring of the collection of insects. 



In the departments other than those here indicated, the work has 




3t4 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



been done under the immediate superintendence of the Curator- 

 in-Charge and his assistant. Almost the entire collection of recent 

 Invertebrata contained in the Museum — barring the Mollusca — 

 has been re-arranged and re-classifled, and the different groups 

 have been so placed as to follow one another serially according 

 to their position in the natural scale. The very extensive series 

 of crabs, which have heretofore occupied the window spaces on 

 the first gallery, filling some twenty-four cases, have been inter- 

 calated with the general collection of Invertebrata on the top 

 floor, where they occupy practically the entire western wall. A 

 re-arrangement of the Carcinological groups, following Ger- 

 stsecker, has been effected. By this shifting of the collections, the 

 first gallery will be relegated exclusively to ornithology, the 

 vacated window cases having been removed to the main floor to 

 relieve the crowded condition of the geological and paleontologi- 

 cal collections. Despite this large accession of table cases, and 

 the addition of an equal number from other parts of the hall, the 

 collections of Invertebrate Paleontology will barely find accom- 

 modation. Roughly estimated the fossils of the different geo- 

 logical formations fill some 20,000-22,000 trays, and in point of 

 individual numbers probably do not fall short of 15,000-80,000 

 specimens, or about one-half the number that is registered in the 

 department of recent conchology. The work of arranging the 

 American series of fossils is now practically complete, and con- 

 siderably over three-quarters of the collection is permanently 

 labeled. The re-labeling of the entire series of fossils collected 

 by the late Wm. M. Gabb in Santo Domingo and California 

 has been effected during the year, and much has been done 

 toward re-determining the type fossils of the first New York 

 survej'', collected by Mr. T. A. Conrad. The largest and most 

 important accession to this department is a collection of 

 fossils from the Miocene and Pliocene formations of the State of 

 Florida, collected in the early part of the year by the Curator- 

 in-Charge, to whom leave of absence had been granted by the 

 Academy for the purpose of prosecuting researches and collect- 

 ing, in conjunction with the Wagner Free Institute of Science. 

 This collection, together with an extensive series of inver- 

 tebrates dredged in the Gulf of Mexico and in the inland waters 

 of the State, have not yet been placed in the Museum proper, but 

 are temporarily deposited in a side room, where the specimens 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



may be conveniently studied and determined. This work is now 

 accomplished in great part. 



Some attention has been given during the year to the re- 

 arranging of the collections of Vertebrata. The lizards have 

 been removed from the south wall of the second gallery to the 

 east wall, and the amphibians to the north wall, thereby placing 

 the collection of reptiles in a continuous series. In the depart- 

 ment of Ornithology, beyond a general oversight of the collec- 

 tions, no work has been accomplished. Some four or five 

 Dermestes-eaten specimens, which had apparently not been 

 properly cured, have been permanently removed from the cases, 

 being no longer fit for exhibition. Barring such sporadic cases 

 of destruction the collection is in a fairly good condition ; never- 

 theless, it is absolutely necessary that an early examination of 

 all the specimens be made by an expert taxidermist, and such 

 steps be taken as will insure the collection from further loss. 



Work in the department of Vertebrate Paleontology has been 

 almost exclusively restricted to the collections of mammals and 

 fishes ; both of these have been entirely re-arranged, and are 

 now much more accessible than they have been heretofore. The 

 large specimens of fossil reptiles from the Lias of England, the 

 valuable gift of Dr. T. B. Wilson, which had been built up into 

 cases on the main floor of the Museum, have been permanently 

 placed on the wall surface of the vestibule, where they are dis- 

 played to good advantage. It is designed to cover the remainder 

 of the wall-space with two large maps, respectively illustrative 

 of the geology of the national domain and of the zoogeographi- 

 cal regions of the earth's surface. The undersigned has charged 

 himself with the preparation of this work. 



The collection of alcoholics is in good condition, the entire 

 series having been overhauled as in previous years. Consider- 

 able alteration has been made in the disposition of the cases 

 throughout the Museum hall, and much floor space has been 

 gained thereby ; but such gains are far from sufficient to satisfy 

 the wants of the institution, the future usefulness of which will 

 be largely impaired unless immediate aid toward the erection of 

 an extension to the present building is afl"orded. It is well within 

 the truth to sa}^ that the existing collections, if properly displayed, 

 would completely flll a building of twice the dimensions of the 

 present one, The large and very valuable collections of the 




376 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



Pennsylvania Geological Survey, contained in upwards of 200 

 cases, still remain in the cellar, boxed, for want of exhibition 

 space. The types of the greater number of the fossil plants 

 described by Lesquereux in his Coal Flora of the United States, 

 probably one of the most valuable collections of fossil plants in 

 the world, have been added to this collection during the year, 

 but, for similar reasons, still remain boxed. The report of the 

 Professor of Ethnology and Archaeology indicates that accessions 

 to this department of the Academy's Museum could readily be 

 had were proper exhibition space provided, but that under present 

 conditions the same is impossible. In view of these facts the 

 necessity for an extension to the Academy's building cannot be 

 too strongly insisted upon. 



Of equal importance to the future welfare of the institution is 

 a fund designed for the purposes of zoogeographical exploration. 

 As suggested in our last report, the interest derived from a princi- 

 pal fund of $50,000 would fairly equip an annual expedition to any 

 of the largely unexplored regions lying about our domain, such 

 as Mexico, Central America, the Bahamas, Labrador, etc. Only 

 through this method of reseai'ch can it be hoped to bring in large 

 accessions of new material to the working naturalist, and thereby 

 place him in direct relation with the problems of nature. The 

 success attending the Florida Expedition of the Wagner Free 

 Institute of Science of this city, which was organized with the 

 co-operation of the Academy in the winter of the present year, 

 fully demonstrates the wisdom of such a plan of explorations, at 

 the same time that it proves its ready feasibility and possible 

 economic character. 



Specimens have been loaned for -study during the year to Profs. 

 Whitfield and Britton,of New York, to Profs. Osborn and Scott, 

 of Princeton, and to Messrs. Ridgewaj'- and Vasey, of Washing- 

 ton, all of whom have rendered service to the institution in the 

 determination and description of its specimens. The Academy 

 has also profited through the studies of three Jessup Fund bene- 

 ficiaries, who have at various times rendered service to the 

 Curator-in-Charge; to these persons the Curator-in-Charge begs 

 to tender his thanks. 



' Very respectfully, 



Angelo Heilprin, 



Curator-in- Charge.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF THE WILLIAM S. 

 YAUX COLLECTIONS. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux collections respectfullj'- 

 submits his fourth annual report to the Council of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences : — 



The collections are in good order and condition, no change 

 having been made since the report of 1885, except the introduc- 

 tion of one hundred and fourteen mineral specimens, purchased 

 by the approval of the Curators of the Academy, during the year 

 ending November 30, 1886. 



No. of mineral specimens as by report of Nov. 30, 1885, 6,516 

 Purchased between Nov. 30, 1885, and Nov. 30, 188G, . 114 



Total, 6,630 



Archaeological specimens (same as noted in report of 



1885), no additions, 2,940 



The growth of the collection since it came into possession of 

 the Academy is as follows : — 



Nov. 80, 1884, specimens purchased, .... 60 



Nov. 30, 1885, specimens purchased, . . . . 104 



Nov. 30, 1886, specimens purchased, .... 114 



In all, 278 



These 278 specimens have been purchased at an aggregate cost 

 of $1448.70. 



It will be conceded that the new material added to the mineral- 

 ogical collection since 1883 has very materially improved its 

 character, not only in beauty, but for scientific study. 



Among the specimens most worthy of special note which 

 have been added are a number of fine transparent crystals of 

 Topaz from Siberia. One of these is a crystal 1^ inches square, 

 2^ inches in height, on a matrix of Feldspar, coated with Albite; 

 it is a well terminated rhombic prism, showing the basal cleavage 

 planes with great beauty. Also worthy of mention are a fine 

 specimen of Zircon from Canada, weighing 12|- pounds, made 

 up of a group of square prismatic crystals, measuring 3^ x 4 

 inches and 9^ inches in height ; a specimen of Stibnite from 

 Japan, a cluster of long, well terminated crystals, with interesting 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1886. 



modifications 2i by 3^ inches, 18 inches long; specimens of 

 Vanaclinite, Wulfenite, and Descloizite, from Arizona ; emerald 

 and Hiddenite from North Carolina. The Tourmalines, Rutiles 

 and Molybdenites, already well illustrated, have received rich 

 addition. 



A number of new species, not before represented in the collec- 

 tion, have been obtained together with many varieties from new 

 localities. 



All the income of the fund has been expended on the collec- 

 tion, except a balance in hand of $513.54, applicable to the pur- 

 chase of new specimens and of books. As the cases are now 

 paid for and no other expense anticipated, the entire income can 

 be used for the purchase of additional specimens and books, 

 which will — unless some unforeseen accident occurs — always keep 

 the collection up to a high standard of importance. From a 

 scientific point of view it is one of the best public collections in 



our country. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Jacob Binder, 

 Curator. 



REPORT OF THE RECORDER OF THE BIOLOGICAL 

 AND MICROSCOPICAL SECTION. 



During the year the Section held fourteen meetings, with an 

 average attendance of twelve persons. 



At these meetings a great variety of objects was shown. 

 Especial notice should be made of the observations on embry- 

 ology at various meetings by Messrs. Sharp, Wingate and Ryder ;

The Section passed a resolution of respect upon the death of 

 Dr. J. G. Richardson, who, although not connected with the 

 Section at the time of his death, had been at one time an active 

 and useful member. 



Very respectfully, 



Robert J. Hess, 



Becorder. 



REPORT OF THE CONCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Recorder of the Conchological Section respectfully re- 

 ports that during the year ending December 1, 1886, the Academy 

 has continued the publication of conchological papers as hereto- 

 fore. The death of one member has occurred, that of Mrs. Lucy 

 W. Say, the venerable and esteemed widow of the eminent 

 naturalist, Thomas Say, which occurred November 15th last, at 

 the advanced age of 86 years. 



No new members or correspondents have been elected, nor has 

 there been any change in the By-Laws of the Section. 



Mr. George W. Tryon, Jr., Conservator, reports as follows : — 



" During the past year, thirty -nine donations and purchases of 

 shells have been received from twenty-six persons, aggregating 

 1252 traj^s and 7506 specimens. A detailed list of these acces- 

 sions is appended (see 'Additions to Museum '). 



"Among them may be especially mentioned the purchase of 




380 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



nearly 500 species from Greece and the eastern portion of the 

 Mediterranean Sea, collected by Mr. Conemenos ; and another 

 purchase of 277 species from southern France and the western 

 part of the Mediterranean, collected by M. Dollfus. 



" From the Polynesian and Australian regions we have re- 

 ceived important collections from Mr. John Brazier, of Sydney, 

 Australia, Mr. Andrew Garrett, of Papeete, Taheiti, and Mr. 

 W. F. Petterd, of Hobart, Tasmania ; these collections, num- 

 bering about 200 species, were mostly new to our museum. 



" Shells of our own country have been received from Messrs. 

 Binney, Dall, Dore, Ford, Hermann, Heilprin, Jefferis, Leidy, 

 Mazyck, Morrison, Morse, Orcutt, Pilsbry, Quintard, Kedfield, 

 Rush, Sharp, Singley, Stearns, Thompson. These collections 

 embrace some of the new and rare species needed to complete 

 our series, but for the most part add new localities for species 

 already possessed by us. Your Conservator purchased from 

 Mr. Sowerby, of London, and presented about 100 species, all 

 new to us, and filling some important gaps in the collection. 



"The Conchological Museum now contains 45,184 trays and 

 written tablets, and 165,858 specimens. 



"Mr. Frank Stout has, as usual, mounted and labeled the 

 accessions of the year, and they have been distributed to the 

 cases in the museum by Mr. Wm. B. Marshall. 



" The work of redetermining the collection, in connection with 

 the preparation of monographs of the genera for the ' Manual 

 of Conchology,' progresses steadily. Our species of the fami- 

 lies Calyptrseidae, Xenophoridse, Turritellidae, CjEcidse, Yerme- 

 tidee, Pyramidellidse, Turbonillidse and Scalariidse, have been 

 carefully studied by your Conservator; the Solariidae by Mr. 

 Marshall. In the land shells, the Zonitidae have been completed, 

 and a commencement made upon the Helicidae. 



" In accordance with the new plan of arrangement of the 

 Museum sketched in the last Annual Report, a considerable por- 

 tion of the marine gastropods have been classified, both in the 

 Systematic and Geographical Series, and the Synoptical Collec- 

 tion (a representation of the principal generic types, with printed 

 descriptions of their characters) has been finished. It is believed 

 that for completeness, beauty of arrangement and adaptability to 

 the needs of students, these several collections will compare 

 favorably with similar ones in any other museum. An index is 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3S1 



intended to be added to the Synoptical Series, by the aid of 

 which the student, after determining the genus of any specimen, 

 will be referred to the case containing the species ; in the latter 

 he will find represented, either by specimens or colored illustra- 

 tions, all the (figured) species of the genus known to science, 

 arranged in the order of their natural relationships. 



" Much of the success of these features of arrangement is due 

 to the efficient co-operation of my assistant, Mr. Marshall. 



" Messrs. J. H. Redfield, S. R. Roberts and Wm. L. Mactier, 

 have contributed to the Section's collection of autograph letters 

 of conchologists."

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SECTION. 

 (American Entomological Society.) 



The Entomological Section of the Academy has experienced 

 an improvement this year, in comparison with preceding ones. 

 The meetings, which have been regularly held, have been better 

 attended, and a more general interest taken in the proceedings. 



One member and five associates have been elected. During 

 the year the Section has lost two members by death. Mr. Chas. 

 Wilt, one of the deceased members, was one of the founders of 

 the American Entomological Society, and had been very active 

 in all the work of the Section. His valuable collection of Coleop- 

 tera has been given by his son, Mr. H. C. Wilt, to the American 

 Entomological Society, while the Lepidoptera were purchased at 

 an almost nominal price by the same society. The custodian of 

 the society is now engaged in arranging these collections. All 

 duplicates will be set aside for placing in the public exhibition of 




38^ PRdCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1881 



the A.<'Cademy. This Collection foi* public view is now assuming 

 a ni®re definite form than heretofore, through the earnest efforts 

 of Mr. G. B. Cresson, the Custodian. 



During the year twelve written communications have been 

 accepted by the American Entomological Society for publication 

 in its Transactions, which still continue to maintain their stan- 

 dard of previous years. In addition to these, a work entitled 

 " Synopsis of the Hymenoptera of North America," by Mr. E. T. 

 Cresson, is being published by the society, in separate form, as 

 an intercalary volume. The display made by the Section at the 

 exhibition of the Microscopical Section was of great interest to 

 those present. 



At the meeting held in December, the following officers were 

 elected for the year 188T :

REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL SECTION. 



The Yice-Director of the Botanical Section respectfully reports 

 that the prosperity noted in past j^ears still continues, chiefly 

 tiirough the voluntary work of its active members. The Con- 

 servator's account, adopted as part of this report, shows a very 

 gratifying growth in the Herbarium, which is one of which the 

 Academy may be proud. The membership, with some few 

 additions and losses, remains about the same as last year. The 

 Section is wholly free of debt, and has a balance in the treasury. 

 Meetings have been held regularlj^ on the second Monday evening 

 in each month, except during the summer recess, and many new 

 or interesting facts in botany have been brought to the notice of 

 members — some of which have been thought worthy of recording 

 in the Proceedings of the Academj^

Conservator's Report for 1886. — The Conservator of the Bo- 

 tanical Section reports that the donations to the Herbarium, 

 during the year just closed, consist of 2452 species of plants, of 

 which 2433 are of phanerogams and vascular cryptogams, and 19 

 of lichens. Of these, 726 species are new to the collection, and 

 among them are representatives of 40 new genera. Of the 2452 

 species, 847 are North American, 858 are from Tropical and South 

 America, and 747 are from the Old World. The total number of 

 species of phanerogams and vascular cryptogams now in the 

 Herbarium is estimated at 26,189. 



A list of the donations for the year is appended to this report. 

 Among them may be specified 232 species of North American 

 grasses from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at Washington, 

 embracing 73 new species. These, with a collection of 54 species, 

 made by F. Tweedy in the Yellowstone Park, make our series of 

 N. American grasses unusually complete. From Dr. A Gray, of 

 the Harvard University Herbarium, we have received about 30O 

 species from the Old and the New World, embracing many 

 novelties. Members of our Section have presented two fine 

 collections made by Pringle and by Palmer in the Mexican 

 province of Chihuahua, consisting of 710 species, of which 267 

 are new to us, and a very choice collection of South African 

 plants made by Miss M. E. Cummings, nearly one-half of which 

 were not in our Herbarium. Mr. Aubrey H. Smith has presented 

 us 154 species which he collected in Colorado, New Mexico, and 

 California (see Additions to Museum). 



The work of mounting the specimens in the North American 

 Herbarium is still continued, and considerable progress has been 

 made during the past year with the assistance of Mr. Burk. 




884 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OE [1886. 



During this period the N. America species of Cyperus have been 

 carefully revised by Prof. Britton, of Columbia College, New 

 York ; and the perplexing species of Paspalicm, by Dr. Vasey, of 

 Washington. Dr. John W. Eckfeldt has continued his special 

 care of the lichens of the Academj^, adding to their number, 

 and has so arranged and catalogued the several collections of 

 this order, as greatly to facilitate reference. Similar work is 

 greatly needed for the remaining order of the lower Cryptogams. 



John H. Redfield, 



Conservator. 



REPORT OF THE MINERALOGICAL AND GEO- 

 LOGICAL SECTION. 



The Director of the Mineralogical and Geological Section of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences would respectfully report that 

 meetings have been held regularly during the year, but that 

 owing to the enforced absence of several of the more active 

 members the attendance has not been as great as formerly. The 

 additions to the cabinet, while not as numerous as in former 

 years, have been considerable and valuable. A number of them 

 have been purchased with the funds of the Section. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Theo. D. Rand, 



Director. 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF INYERTEBRATE 

 PALEONTOLOGY. 



The Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology respectfully reports 

 that dui'ing the year he has delivered a course of lectures, with 

 practical demonstrations, on geology and paleontology, which 

 course was supplemented by a number of field excursions in 

 the surroundings of Philadelphia. A special excursion, designed 

 for the purposes of original investigation, and extending over a 

 period of two weeks, was conducted during the month of July to 

 Nantucket and Martha's Yineyard, resulting in valuable acquis!- 




1886.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 385 



tions of both, zoological and geological material. Special atten- 

 tion was directed to tlie study of the fossiliferous deposits of 

 the Island of Nantucket, with the result of demonstrating the 

 erroneousness of the hitherto described sections of those deposits. 

 The data obtained during this trip will be published in the 

 Proceedings of the Academy. 



The collections of the Academy in the department of Inverte- 

 brate Paleontology have been, as far as arrangement and classifi- 

 cation are concerned, materially improved during the year; the 

 entire series of fossils pertaining to American geology is now 

 readily accessible, and in a condition for easy reference. More 

 than three-fourths of this collection are permanently labeled. 

 Roughly estimated, the collections in this department, embracing 

 both foreign and American fossils, occupy upwards of 20,000 

 trays, and are probably second to no other collection in import- 

 ance in this country. Special importance attaches to the series 

 of Cretaceous and Tertiary fossils, especiall}^ the latter, in which 

 are included probably four-fifths of all the types that have been 

 described from this country. The Paleozoic fauna is, on the 

 other hand, very inadequately represented, although the collec- 

 tions of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey, now deposited with 

 the institution, will add very materially to this section when 

 displayed. 



Further reference to the collections in the department of 

 Invertebrate Paleontology is contained in the report of the 

 Curators of the Academy. 



Yery respectfully, 



Angelo Heilprin, 

 Trof. of Invertebrate Paleontology. 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF INYERTEBRATB 

 ZOOLOGY. 



The Professor of Invertebrate Zoology respectfully reports 

 that during the past year he has delivered a course of ten lectures 

 on the " Special Senses." 



He further reports that the collections under his charge have 

 somewhat increased. 

 36 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1886. 



There is a good collection of marine invertebrates, not yet 

 officially presented to the Academy, from the West Coast of 

 Florida, collected in the spring of this year by Prof. Angelo 

 Heilprin. 



A course of ten or twelve lectures will be given in the spring 

 of the coming year (March and April), the subject being " Sense 

 Organs in the Animal Kingdom." 



Very respectfully, 



Benjamin Sharp, 

 Professor of Invertebrate Zoology, 



REPORT OF THE PROFESSOR OF ETHNOLOGY AND 

 ARCHJ]:OLOGY. 



During the last year two short courses of lectures were deliv- 

 ered in the rooms of the Academy, one on the General Principles 

 of Ethnology, the second on the special topic of American Archae- 

 ology. The latter was illustrated by numerous specimens from 

 the collections of the Academy. Both were reasonably well 

 attended, and it is believed that an increasing interest is shown 

 in these subjects. 



Some material was added to the collections in this department 

 during the year, but the same difficulty mentioned in the last 

 report, has interfered with obtaining as many specimens as would 

 be practicable — that is to say, a lack of space for their proper 

 accommodation and display. 



Respectfully submitted, 



D. G. Brinton, M.D., 

 Professor of Ethnology and Archaeology.
