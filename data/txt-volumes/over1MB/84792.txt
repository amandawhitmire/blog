NEW JAPANESE MARINE MOLLUSCA : GASTKOPODA. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The new species of Gastropoda contained in recent sendings from 

 Mr. Y. Hirase are herein described. The material studied contains 

 a large number of species previously not known from Japanese waters, 

 which I hope to enimierate in a future paper. 



Some shells from a collection made in Sagami Bay for the Academy, 

 by Miss A. C. Hartshorne, are also included in this account. 



TEREBRID^. 

 Terebra hedleyi n. sp. PI. I. figs, l, la. 



Shell slender, the length about 5§ times the diameter, sohd, w^hitish, 

 marked sparsely with brown dots on the cinguli and with streaks below 

 them, the last whorl with some dots or spots in a circular row on the 

 base. 



Sculpture consisting of a wide above a narrower tuberculate cord, 

 occupying somewhat more than half the total width of the whorl, 

 below these cinguli there are four small equal spiral cords, the lowest 

 one parth' covered at the suture. On the last whorl these cords gradu- 

 ally diminish downward, those on the periphery and base being small 

 and very low or subobsolete. The grow^h-strise are oblique on the 

 cinguh, arcuate on the cords below them. Whorls 15^, the first large 

 and globose, first H smooth and gray- white. The last whorl abruptly 

 contracts below, and is produced in a short anterior canal. Aperture 

 small, irregularly rhombic, the outer hp thin and sinuous, columella 

 vertical, abruptly bent to the left below, covered with a glossy white 

 callous, which extends over the parietal wall. 



Length 33.6, diam. 6 mm.; length of aperture 6 mm.; diam. of the 

 first whorl 1 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Types No. 85,946, A. N. S. P.," from No. 1,412 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is related to T. serotina A. and R., and the closely allied 

 or identical T. mariesi Sm., but it is not costate below the tuberculate 

 bands, and the protoconch is very much larger. Named in honor of 

 Charles Hedley, of the Australian Museum. 




4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Terebra hizenensis n. sp. PI. I, figs. 2, 2a. 



SheU slender with straight lateral outHnes, white, lusterless. Whorls 

 151, nearly flat, the first two smooth, the first whorl rather globose and 

 convex. Seidptiu-e of rather strong, even, shghtly arcuate rounded 

 ribs, about 21 in number on the last whorl, and nearly as wide as their 

 intervals. These ribs are cut but not interrupted by a spiral groove 

 defining a subsutural fasciole, the groove being deeper in the inter- 

 stices. Below the groove or fm-row there are 6 to 8 spiral cords, low 

 on the smnmits of the ribs, stronger in the intervals; and above the 

 furrow there are 4 or 5 finer spiral threads. The suture is rather deeply 

 impressed. The small aperture is irregularly trapezoidal; columella 

 vertical; canal recurved. Length 26, diam. 6, longest axis of aperture 

 6 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Types No. 85,993, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,529 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Similar to T. subtextilis Smith in color and sculpture, but in speci- 

 mens of the same length this species is broader with a larger apertiu-e. 



Terebra awajiensis n. sp. PI. I, figs. 3, 3a. 



Shell straightly acuminate, rather slender, the diameter contained 

 about 4| times in the length. The upper half of each whorl is brownish 

 cream-tinted, the lower half purphsh or reddish-brown, usually paler 

 or fading toward the suture below. The last whorl has a supra- 

 peripheral purple-brown band, sharply defined on its upper edge, paler 

 and fading below, where it is interrupted by light streaks. It extends 

 as far as the basal contraction, but just below the periphery is divided 

 by a narrow whitish spiral band. Sculptiu-e of rather acute, nearly 

 vertical riblets, which bend forward a little below, and on the last 

 whorl are distinctly bent forward, and gradually diminish dowmward, 

 disappearing at the subperipheral light band. The ribs are pale and 

 interrupt the dark band. The intervals are concave and wider than 

 the ribs, wdthout spiral striation, but the whole surface shows faint 

 growth-lines. Shghtly below the upper third each whorl is cut by a 

 spiral furrow interrupted by the ribs, leaving an oblong pit in each 

 interval (but in some specimens the furrow is continuous though weak 

 over the ribs). The pits are first developed on the 8th or 9th whorl, 

 those above having no trace of the sulcus. ^Vhorls about 18, the first 

 3 smooth, the apical whorl purple-black and having a diameter of 

 about .3 mm.; subsequent whorls nearly flat, parted by a narrow, 

 impressed suture, the last whorl roimdcd peripherally, strongly con- 

 tracted below. Siphonal fasciole short and convex, bounded above 

 by a low and inconspicuous ridge. Aperture a little less than one- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



fourth the length of the shell, acuminate above, with a deep and wide 

 basal channel. Columella brown, w4th a low, wide and very indistinct 

 basal fold, below which it is bent somewhat to the left. Parietal wall 

 covered with a thin transparent varnish. 



Length 37, diam. S mm. ; length of aperture 8.8 mm. ; 21 ribs on last 

 whorl. 



Length 35, diam. 7.3 mm.: length of aperture 8.7 mm.; 25 ribs on 

 last whorl. 



Fukura, Awaji. Types Xo. 86,004, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,352 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is close to T. nitida Hinds in sculpture, but it is less 

 slender, and the last whorl is more swollen peripherally and more 

 contracted beneath. It differs from T. lischkeana in the smooth inter- 

 costal spaces. 

 Parviterebra paucivolvis n. sp. PI. I, fig. 4. 



Shell lanceolate, moderately solid, w^hite with four spiral series of 

 squarish red-brown spots, the upper series bordering the suture below, 

 two others at the periphery, and the fourth on the base. The sutm-e 

 is widely gray-margined by transparence. Sculpture of close, fine, 

 rounded longitudinal riblets, as wide as their intervals, and on the 

 last whorl much smaller, almost obsolete. These are crossed by spiral 

 subpunctate impressed lines, which are rather widely spaced, "WTiorls 

 7, but slightly convex, the last, as seen from the front, longer than 

 the spire, gradually tapering downward. Aperture lanceolate, the 

 columellar margin but slightly concave. 



Length 12, diam. 3.4 mm. 



Length 11.5, diam. 3 mm. 



Yakujima, Osumi. Types No. 86,133, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,419 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species seems most closel}'' related to the Australian Euryta 

 hrazieri Angas, which, however, has a larger aperture. Also to E. 

 pulchella Angas {Terebra angasi Tryon) and E. trilineata Angas, both 

 of which differ in details of form and coloration. The small Japanese 

 T. tantilla Smith is diversely sculptured and belongs to a different 

 section. The Australian species mentioned are placed in the sub- 

 genus Euryta by Angas and Tryon, but they are not related to the 

 type of Euryta (now Mazatlania). I propose for them the genus 

 Parviterebra, characterized by the small number of whorls, absence 

 of any groove defining a subsutural band, and by the long, gradually 

 tapering body-whorl without a differentiated siphon al fascicle at the 

 base, the columella straight to its abrupt truncation below. This 




6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



geniis is not closely related to Terebra or the subgenus Mazatlania, 

 but seems to belong to the Terebridce. The Japanese species defined 

 above is the type of this group. 



CONID^. 



Conus dormitor n. sp. PL I, figs. 9, 9a. 



Shell rather narrow and long, the diameter somewhat more than ^ 

 the length, the spire elevated, concave-sided, i the length of the shell. 

 The apex is broken off, 11 whorls remaining, the peripheral angle of 

 each projecting above the suture. The last 2h are even atthe periphery, 

 but those preceding are nodulose. The concave, steeply slopmg 

 upper surface of each whorl is closely and regularly, finely costulate, 

 the riblets arcuate, and decussated by several unequal spiral shallow 

 grooves. The last wiiorl has almost straight lateral outlines, and is 

 sculptured with closely punctate spiral grooves, very faint near the 

 angle of the whorls, but becoming stronger and closer toward the base. 

 The siphonal fasciole is closely spirally striate, not punctate. The 

 aperture is long, narrow, and of equal width throughout. 



Length 44, diam. 16 mm.; aperture 34 mm. long. 



Kikai, Osumi, in a deposit probably Pliocene. Types Xo. 85,950, 

 A. N. S. P., from Xo. 1,552 of Mr. Hirase's -collection. 



This cone is related to C. acutangulus Lam., but is longer than that 

 species. C. aculeiformis Rve. is similar in shape, but differs in sculp- 

 ture. The specimens show no color. 



Conus kikaiensis n. sp. PI. I, figs. 8, 8a. 



Shell long and narrow, the diameter about one-third the length, 

 the elevated and slightly concave-sided spire one-fourth the length. 

 Whorls remaining 10, nearly flat and steeply sloping, the smooth 

 peripheral angle projecting a little above the suture, the surface above 

 it sculptured with 3 to 5 low, unequal spiral cords, and fine, arcuate 

 growth-lines. Lateral outlines of the last whoii nearly straight. 

 Sculpture of regular, rather strong, narrow spiral grooves, which are 

 somewhat striate across, weaker above. There are 23-25 of these 

 grooves above the convex siphonal fasciole, wliich is indistinctly finely 

 striate spirally. In some specimens the flat intervals between the 

 grooves are divided in the middle by a smaller groove. 



Length 40-41, diam. 13 mm. 



Kikai, Osumi; fossil in a PHocene (?) deposit. Types Xo. 85,948, 

 A. N. S. P.. from Xo. 1,553 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is not unlike C. dormitor and C. aculeiformis in general 

 shape, but it differs essentially from both in the sculpture of the spire. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



The outer lip is a good deal damaged in both of the specimens 



received. 



Conus gratacapii a. sp. PI. I, figs. 10, lOa. 



Shell slender and len^hened, the diameter somewhat exceeding 

 one-third of the length, the high straight-sided spire occupying two- 

 fifths the length of the shell. Apex broken. 12 whorls remaining are 

 flat, mth the smooth peripheral angle immediately above the suture, 

 but scarcely projecting, a little more prominent on the upper than on 

 the lower whorls. The surface of each whorl is a trifle concave, and 

 sculptured with about 6 low, unequal spiral cords. Below the periph- 

 eral angle the last whorl is sculptured with about 25 spiral grooves, 

 weaker above, stronger and closer below; and the growth-striae curve 

 strongly backward near the angle. The aperture is very narrow, and 

 of equal width throughout, and two-thirds as long as the shell. 



Length 30, diam. 11 mm.; length of aperture 20 mm. 



Length 31, diam. 11.5 mm.; length of aperture 20.3 ram. 



Elikai, Osumi, in a Pliocene (?) deposit. Types No. 85,947, 

 A. N. S. P., from No. 1,554 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This peculiar species resembles C. kikaiensis in sculpture, but is 

 unUke that in form. It is named for Mr. L. P. Gratacap, of the Ameri- 

 can Museum of Natural History. 



PLEUROTOMID^. 

 Drillia streptonotus n. sp. PL III, figs. 18, ISa, 18b. 



Shell slender and turrite, solid, light brown with an obscure band 

 below the suture and another on the base. Sculpture of regular, 

 sub vertical rounded folds as wide as their intervals, about 18 in num- 

 ber on the la.st whorl, where they disappear a short distance below the 

 periphery. These are crossed by numerous spiral threads, alternately 

 larger and smaller, but on the lower, contracted half of the last whorl 

 the spirals are regular and equal. Under a strong lens the whole sur- 

 face is seen to be covered with densely crowded rows of minute 

 papillae. Whorls 9^, strongly convex. The first whorl is smooth and 

 rounded; then an acute peripheral keel begins, and a whorl and a 

 half later low radial sculpture and fine papillae appear. The first two 

 or three sculptured whorls are angular, the keel persisting to the end 

 in the peripheral thread. Aperture flask-shaped, wider above, the 

 outer lip with about 6 small teeth within, arranged in pairs; deeply 

 excised above, and produced in a short recurved spout at the anal sinus; 

 contracted below to form a short siphonal canal. 



Length 8.8, diam. 2.8 mm. ; length of aperture 3 mm.

Length 6.9, diam. 2.3 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Types Xo. 86,128, A. X. S. P., from Xo. 1,4166 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Distinct by its tiirrite shape, convex whorls and spoiit-hke anal sinus, 

 and the beautiful minute sculptvu-e, hardly visible without a compound 

 microscope. 

 DriUia albiguttata n. sp. PI. Ill, fig. 19. 



This species, of which only more or less beach-worn specimens have 

 been received, is extremely similar to D. zebra Lam. of the West Indies. 

 It is somewhat more slender. The ground color is chocolate. The 

 sculpture consists of thick longitudinal ribs, 12 on the last whorl, each 

 with a white spot at the shoulder, another below the middle of the last 

 whorl, and there is a white band aroimd the siphonal fasciole. There 

 is a seam-like welt below the suture, and the unworn intervals between 

 the ribs are sculptured with alternately large and small spiral cords. 

 Whether these pass over the ribs or not cannot be ascertained from 

 the examples examined. The lip and anal sinus are Hke those parts 

 in D. zebra. 



Length 11, diam. 4.5 mm. 



Seto, Kii. Types Xo. 86,122, A. X. S. P., from Xo. 1,349 of Mr. 

 Hirase's collection. 



Daphnella radula n. sp. PI. II, figs. 17, 17a. 



Shell fusiform, rather sohd, pale brown, indistinctly mottled with 

 white and marked vdih. short brown Hues on the larger spiral cords, 

 a series of alternately white and browai squarish spots below the 

 suture. Surface sharply sculptured with alternate spiral cords and 

 threads, about 52 in all on the last whorl, intersected by fine raised 

 longitudinal threads, prominent where they cross the spirals. The 

 lower edge of the anal fasciole is defined by a sulcus sUghtly unHke the 

 other intervals, where the growth-fines bend abruptly backward. 

 Whorls 8, the first two brown, with the usual diagonally intersecting 

 grooves of Daphnella, the next whorl with three spirals. Last whorl 

 long, tapering above and below. Aperture more than half the shell's 

 length. Outer lip thick but beveled to an edge, obliquely and 

 deeply excised above, a little sinuated near the base. The anterior 

 channel is short and rather shallow. 



Length 13.5, diam. 5 mm.; length of aperture 7.7 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Types Xo. 85,965, A. N. S. P., from Xo. 903a of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



The shell of this species is thick, like that of Daphnella maculosa 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



Pse.; but it is noticeably wider than that, with a more ample apertm-e 

 and entirely different coloration. 



Mangilia pura n. sp. PI. II, figs. 15, 15a. 



Shell fusiform, rather thin, cream-white, indistinctly stained with 

 brown in some places below the suture. Sculpture of curved, shghtly 

 sinuous, rounded longitudinal ribs, slightly narrower than their con- 

 cave intervals, and about 21 in niunber on the last w^horl; the last rib 

 much larger, forming a stout lip-varix. These are crossed by many 

 spaced spiral threads passing over ribs and intervals, and about 30 

 in number on the last whorl. The intervals between these threads 

 are sometimes divided by a secondary threadlet ; and there is through- 

 out a very minute, even and regular granulation produced by the inter- 

 section of spiral and longitudinal striae. Whorls about 8, the first 

 two rounded, and with delicate spaced costulae, forming a trochoidal 

 nucleus; the last whorl slightly ascending in front. Aperture long and 

 narrow, obtuse at the ends, smooth within, slightly retracted above. 



Length 13, diam. 4.7 mm.; length of aperture 7.7 mm. 



Length 9.8, diam. 3.8 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Types No. 85,974, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,527 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species seems to be similar to M. cylindrica Reeve, but that 

 shell is more slender. 



Mangilia semicarinata n. sp. PI. II, figs. 16, IGa. 



Shell fusiform-turrite, white with some brow^n stains below the suture 

 and a bro\Mi spot at the middle of the lip-varix; rather thin. Sculp- 

 ture of many slightly oblique and arcuate longitudinal riblets about 

 as wide as their inter\'als, and sixteen in number on the last whorl. 

 These are crossed by spaced spiral threads, about 18 from the shoulder 

 down on the last whorl, a little widened where they pass over the rib- 

 lets. The spaces between the threads and above the shoulder are 

 very finely striate spirally. Whorls 7, the first 1^ roimded, radially 

 weakly costulate, several whorls following convex, rounded, the last 

 2 or 3 whorls angular at the shoulder. The last w^horl bears a narrow, 

 elevated, arcuate hp-varix. Aperture narrow, both. lips slightly arcu- 

 ate; blunt at the ends, smooth within. Anal sinus rather deep and 

 rounded, the varix curving back of it. 



Length 7, diam. 2.7 mm.; length of aperture 2.7 mm.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan. 



Mangilia kamakurana n. sp. PI. II, figs. 11, 11a. 



Shell very small, white with a brown spot in the middle of the lip- 

 varix, the spire terraced, lower half conic. Sculpture of sHghtly 

 curved obliquely longitudinal ribs, 11 on the last whorl, the last one, 

 behind the Hp, much larger. These are crossed by spaced spiral 

 threads, with, smaller threads between them, the intervals still more 

 finely striate spirally. ^Tiorls 5 (the embryonic ones broken off), 

 strongly angular near the middle, flattened and sloping above the 

 angle, contracting below it; the last whorl similarly angular, convex

Purpura tosana n. sp. PI. Ill, fig. 30. 



Shell small, imperforate, fusiform, solid, gray-white with an inter- 

 rupted black-brown band below the suture, another below the periphery 

 and a less distinct one at the base. Sculpture of numerous longitudinal 

 rounded folds or waves, many of them followed by a raised line marking 

 a former peristome. These folds are more distinct on the spire than 

 on the last whorl, where there are 10 to 15 of them. The folds are 

 crossed by numerous strong, rounded spiral cords, which are often 

 weakly striate in the same direction, are wider than their deep intervals, 

 and pass equally over folds and valleys. There are about 10 of these 

 spiral cords on the last whorl, besides some small ones below the suture 

 and in the intervals of the large cords on the basal slope. The inter- 

 .stices in well-preserved shells are delicately, closely lamellose. The 

 spire is rather slender and acute. There are about 7 whorls in perfect 

 shells, the first two forming a smooth, bulbous, skortly cylindric 

 nucleus. Subsequent whorls are somewhat concave below the suture, 

 then convex. The last whorl is inflated peripherally, contracted

 as wide as the intervals, and continuous from whorl to whorl. These 

 are crossed by two strong ridges on the whorls of the spire, one immedi- 

 ately below, one just above the suture, rising into short spines or points 

 at the intersections. On the last whorl there are 4 or 5 prominent 

 spiral ridges, the first close to the suture, the next and most prominent 

 at the angular shoulder; all are spinose where they cross the longitudi-

 behind the lip, usually preceded by a much smaller fold. Over the 

 folds and intervals run coarse spiral cords, rounded or flattened, as 

 wide as their intervals or wider, and either of even strength or weaker 

 in the valleys. On the last whorl there are 9 to 11 of these cords. 

 Some shells show a ver)'' minute and superficial spiral striation through- 

 out. Whorls about 7 (the apex broken), strongly convex, the last 

 rounded at the periphery, sloping below, with a moderately deep 

 basal sulcus. Aperture ovate; outer lip with 7 or 8 teeth wdthin, the 

 lower 4 usually larger, the others small. Columella calloused, white, 

 with 3 small transverse wTinkles. A callous cord near the posterior 

 angle defines a small posterior sinus.

The preoccupation of the name Triton resulting in a search for other 

 names available for the molluscan group has led to some diversity in 

 modern usage. The earliest available name for the group, so far as I 

 have been able to learn, is Aquillus of Montfort. This name, as John- 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



son has pointed out,® precedes Lotorium in the Conchyliologie Sys- 

 iematique. Its resemblance to Aquila is no bar to acceptance because 

 the Latin word aquillus or aquilus,'' signifjdng dark or water-colored, 

 is different from aquila, an eagle. In this connection it may be noted 

 that Montfort used "watery" names for his other genera of Tritons.^ 

 The genera of AquiUida; may therefore stand thus : 



I. — Aquillus Montf., Conch. Syst., II, 578. Type cutaceus L. 



(Includes the sections Lampusia Schum, 1817, type jpilearis L. ; 

 Lotorium ^lonti., 1810, type L. lotor = femoralis L.; Mono- 

 flex Perry, 1811, type cynocephalus Lam.)

 VI. — Gyrineum Link, 1807. 



(Including Biplex Perry, Buffo Montf., Bufonaria and Lampas 

 Schum., etc., some of which are available for subgeneric 

 and sectional divisions.) 



Some authors recognize more than one genus among the forms- 

 referred above to Aquillus, but when a wdde range of species is exam- 

 ined, the subgenera seem to merge pretty thoroughly together. Indeed 

 Septa is not very distinct, except in the typical species. This subject 

 has been ably discussed by Kesteven, with whose conclusions I fully 

 agree. It seems to me that he has shown conclusively the untenability 

 of Ranularia, Lampusia, Lotorium, etc., as generic divisions. Colu- 

 hraria stands apart from all the ether genera, and the examination of 

 its dentition is a desideratum. It may possibly be Rhachiglossate. 

 The subgenus Cumia includes small Mediterranean and Antillean 

 species. A series of Antillean a nd Pacific species referred to this

" Both spellings are given in dictionaries consulted. The etymology suggested 

 by Herrmannsen is obscure and more than doubtful. 



/OS .^^'■"^ (f- <{■' V-}^^) rejects Aquillus because (1) its etymology is uncertain, and 

 (2) if emended sufficiently it can be made identical with Aquila Brisson. It seems 

 scarcely necessary to reply that uncertain etymology is not usually considered 

 ground for rejection ot a name, and no authorization of such a course can be found 

 m the British Association or any later code. And to the second objection it 

 may be urged that by a similar process of emendation about half the names in 

 use might be changed Harris is wide of the mark in citing Murex lotorium as 

 the type oiLotonuni Monti. It is rather hard to see how such a mistake could 

 be made. .Montiort s engraving is a characteristic representation of the common 

 Murex femoralis L.

division by Tryon and others, of which decapitatus Reeve and hracteatus 

 Hinds are typical, belongs to the Rhachiglossa, as Mr. Vanatta and 

 the writer will elsewhere show. Mr. Kesteven has shown that Triton 

 speciosum Angas is a Trophon.

Hirado, Hizen (Hirase, No. 911). 



This species has been erroneously described and figured as T. 

 exarahnn Reeve, an Australian form, which I have determined by com- 

 parison of numerous Australian specimens to be distinct from the 

 Japanese species. Aquillus exaratus (Rve.) has a much more highly 

 conic nucleus with more whorls; the postnepionic whorls have a 

 flatter shoulder, and coarser secondary spiral striation. It should be 

 deleted from the Japanese Hst. 



There is no trustworthy or authentic West Indian record for Aquillus 

 labiosus. The specimens so marked which I have seen are from shell 

 dealers, who, like many others, have not always been careful about 

 localities. 



NATICID^. 



Polinices sagamiensis n. sp. PI. IV, figs. 37, 37a. 



Shell obliquely hemispherical, solid and heav}', smooth; chestnut- 

 brown, with the spire, a band below the suture, and an area at the base, 

 the umbihcus and aperture white. The spire is very small, short and 

 low, though slightly conic. "Whorls 5, the last one very rapidly enlarg- 

 ing, globose, narrowly rounded at the base, where it curves into the 

 miibilicus. The suture is superficial. The very oblique aperture is 

 half round and pure white, the columellar side straight. The posterior 

 angle is filled with a very heavy convex callous. At the middle of the 

 columellar margin a large, rounded, flat-topped lobe projects into the 

 umbilicus, terminating a veiy large spiral cord which nearly fills the 

 axial cavity, leaving a crescentic umbilical furrow, overhung on the 

 convex arc by a heavy rounded rib which forms the outer margin of the 

 umbilicus.

 single specimen obtained by Mr. Frederick Stearns, now in his collec- 

 tion in Detroit. I at that time noted the differences between the speci- 

 men and X. draparnaudii Reel, but thought the former might be 

 abnormal. The large size of the LunbiHcal lobe and the strong cord 

 around the umbihcal crescent readily distinguish P. sagamiensis from 

 draparnavdii, effusa Swains., povAsianus Reel., cumingianus Reel, and 

 other species of that group. 



CALYPTR^ID^. 



Ergaea walshi (' Herm.' Rve.). 



This name Ergcea was originally proposed for a subgenus of Crepidula 

 (Crypta), comprising the species C. plana Ads. and Rve. (not Sa}') and 

 C. walshi 'Herm.' Rve. It was J. E. Gray in 1867 who raised the 

 group to generic rank, explained its morphology, and showed that it 

 is related to Calyptrcea. Gray's half-contemptuous estimate of the 

 inability of his conchological contemporaries to appreciate morpho- 

 logical problems .-expressed in his paper of '67,^ has been amply justified 

 by the history of this genus; for in the latest works it still remains 

 included in Crepidida.^'* Having reached the same conclusion inde- 

 pendently before reading Gray's paper,, it was vi-ith some sm-prise that 

 I found that he had exposed the facts in the case. 



Ergcea is the end of a line of differentiation from Calyptrcea, parallel 

 in its evolution to that phylmn of Crepidula represented by the flat 

 white shpper-Umpets of the group of Crepidula crepidula Linne (C. un- 

 guiformis Lam.) and C. plana Say. The two groups, arising from 

 diverse ancestors, have reached a superficially similar appearance, 

 by adaptation to growing inside other shells. 



Ergwa walshi ('Herm.' Rve.) has been taken by Mr. Hirase at 

 Fukura, Awaji Island (Xo. 1,443 of Hirase's register), and by Miss 

 Hartshorne at Hayama, on Sagami Bay.

 I am unable to see any differences between the shells of this species 

 from South Australia. Japan, ilauritiiis, etc. Though indi\ddually 

 variable, there seems to have been no racial differentiation. Tryon 

 adds the following names to the synonymy of this species : Hipponyx

OERITHIID^. 



Cerithium trailli kikaiensis n. subsp. PI. IV, fig. 38. 



Shell with the lateral outhnes nearly straight above, convex in the 

 lower half; cream-white, sparsely dotted with brownish-yellow on the 

 spiral threads, and with beads of dull violet sparsely and irregularly 

 scattered along the spiral cords. 



Sculpture of three rather weakly tubercidate spiral cords on each of 

 the intermediate whorls of the spire, the upper one close to the suture, 

 the intervals between them spirally striate, there being about 4 threads 

 in each interval, the median one largest. The upper whorls have alter- 

 nate cords and threads, crossed by close longitudinal waves. On the 

 lavSt whorl there are about S principal tuberculate cords, the intervals 

 finely, unevenly striate. The later .whorls have swollen varices at 

 intervals of about half a whorl, but they become closer above, about 

 one-third of a volution apart. Whorls about 10. The aperture is 

 ovate, with a sinu^ above defined by a cord on the inner lip. The outer 

 lip is strengthened by a small varix, and is sulcate within, there being 

 usually a pair of lirae between the terminations of two spiral cords of 

 the exterior. The throat is smooth and white, showing some blackish 

 dots through. The basal channel is very short and oblique. The inner 

 lip is coated with a rather thick deposit of a deep purple color.

 penultimate whorl, and with one rounded varix on the last whorl oppo- 

 site the aperture. The folds do not extend below the periphery on 

 the last whorl, where they are also much weaker. Spiral sculpture

 smaller cords between the upper and middle enlarged ones, and five 

 between the middle and the basal cord, which is largest of alL 

 Sometimes only the median and lower cords are enlarged. Whorls 

 about 9, those of the spire angular at the lower third. Apertm-e ovate

This peculiar httle Cerite is very closely related to Bittium oosimense 

 Watson, but differs by the number of whorls and the details of the 

 spiral sculpture, as may be seen on comparison with Watson's excellent 

 description and figure. It may perhaps be identical with Bittmm 

 scalatum Dunker, That species has been described too briefly to 

 decide with any certainty, and it has not been figured. The species 

 before me, however, is a true Cerithium, not a Bittium.

 Eissoa tokyoensis n. sp. PI. IV, fig. 40. 



Shell very small, regularly tapering from the last whorl, bright chest- 

 nut colored, the very thick peristome white. Sculpture of 8 spiral 

 cords on the last whorl, the upper four rather coarsely regularly tuber- 

 culate, those below less so, the lower two smooth. The spire and upper 

 portion of the last whorl are indistinctly plicate longitudinally, the 

 tubercles on the spirals being at the points of intersection. Whorls 5,

 of rather small close longitudinal riblets, which on the last whorl do 

 not pass below the periphery. These are crossed by about 11 spiral 

 cords on the last whorl. There are about 5 or 5^ shghtly convex 

 whorls, the last one with a broad rounded but rather low varix a short

 the upper third more rapidly tapering to an acute apex; not glossy; 

 white. Sculpture of regular longitudinal rounded ribs, as wide as 

 their intervals and about 19 in number on the penultimate whorl, and 

 not extending upon the base of the last one. These ribs are crossed 

 by numerous unequal fine spiral threads. Whorls 10, moderately

This large Rissoina seems to be rather abundant. With the type 

 lot there was a specimen of a reddish-brown color with a small white 

 basal tract and a light band above. The ribs are more numerous, 

 25 on the penultimate w'horl, and there are 4 broad varices on the last 

 3 whorls, w^hile the type has only 1 at the end of the last volution. The 

 shape is also less cylindric than in the type. More material is needed 

 to determine the status of this form.

 6 whorls remaining. These are slightly convex and separated by a 

 shallow, linear suture. The last whorl is sw^ollen into a wide rounded 

 varix behind the outer lip, the fine riblets of the rest of the smface

I^kai-ga-shima, Osimii, typical specimens of this .species, wliich has 

 not before been reported from the east coast of Asia. The s^monymy 

 as given by Tryon" requires some emendation in the Hght of the large 

 series of specimens now available for stud}-. The following forms, 

 imited with R. tridentata by him, are, in my opinion, perfectly distinct 

 species : 



Rissoa semiglahrata A. Ad., P. Z. S.. 1851. p. 279. 



Rissoa semiplicata Pse., P. Z. S., 1862, p. 242 : Amer. Jour, of Conch., 

 Ill, p. 295, PL 24, fig. 29. 



The former of these differs from all forms of tridentata in the more 

 acuminate spire and the sculpture. The latter, of which specimens 

 from Pease are before me, is a very much smaller species, with more 

 of the spire phcate. I add to the synonymy of R. tridentata the Eulima 

 dentiens of Dunker, of which authentic specimens are before me. It 

 is absolutely identical with tridentata Mich. R. crassilahrum Garrett 

 is also a typical tridentata, with teeth, and 8 mm. long. 



Whether the toothless form coroncfia 'Reel.' Schwartz is varietally 

 separable is doubtful, but the series before me shows that toothless 

 individuals occur with normal tridentata. The size varies a good deal:

The sizes from 5.5 to 10.5 mm. long are represented by specimens 

 before me. Rarely there is a varix on the penultimate whorl. The 

 larger shells are generally somewhat distorted, and are then extremely 

 like Eulinia. Indeed, the whole genus or subgenus Zebina is exces- 

 sively Euhmoid in structure of the shell, so much so as to suggest that 

 the Eulimidce maj^ have had a Rissoinoid progenitor. Probably the 

 Gymnoglossa , even as restricted by Fischer, is not a natural group. 



To the distribution of R. tridentata indicated above should be added 

 the Red Sea localities given by Sturanj-^^ jj^^ j^jg valuable report on the 

 "Pola" gastropods. With the Japanese locality here recorded, this 

 gives the species an enormous range in the Indo-Pacific life-area.

Shell ver}- slender, the length 5 times the greatest diameter; glossy; 

 white, encircled by two brown lines, of Avhich one is at the periphery of 

 the last whorl and ascends the spire a little below the middle of the 

 whorls, and the other revolves below the periphery of the last whorl, 

 its upper edge being bareh^ visible above the suture of the preceding 

 whorls. Sculpture of nearly vertical, slightly arcuate rounded riblets, 

 as wide as their intervals, extending from suture to sutm-e on the 

 spire, and on the last whorl they gradually decrease below the 

 periphery-, becoming obsolete around the axis, where the base is 

 nearly smooth ; over all there is an excessively fine, minute, dense spiral 

 striation. On the last whorl there are 29 riblets. There are 12 convex

 groove smaller than the others, a narrow space between it and the 

 suture. Last whorl with the third groove nearly peripheral, several 

 nan-ower grooves below it on the convex base, ^^^lorls 11, besides 

 the uptiu-ned planorboid nucleus. They are moderately convex and

This species tapers more rapidly than T. triarata, and the 3 spiral 

 grooves are parted by 2 equal spaces. The space above the upper 

 groove is more convex than the others. In immature shells the base 

 has numerous spiral engi-aved striae, closer near the axis, but in the 

 largest shells they become fainter. 



This species must be closely related to Cingulina subulata Clessin,^' 

 described from Macao; but the whorls are more convex, and there 

 are spiral grooves on the base of the last whorl, which in subulata is 

 said to be "nach unten gerundet, glatt." The spiral grooves are more 

 emphatic in T. spina C. and F., of New South Wales and South Aus- 

 tralia, and which has also been reported from Karachi by Melvill, 

 Proc. Zool. Soc, 1901, p. 395. 



The following species of the subgenus Cingulina have been reported 

 from Japan : 



C. cingulata Dkr., Moll. Jap., p. 16. 



C. terebra Dkr., Moll. Jap., p. 16. 



C. circinata A. Ad., Ann. Mag., 1860, VI, p. 414.

 Turbonilla (Cingnilina) cingulata (Dkr.). PI. V, fig. 47. 



In this species there arc three deep equidistant spiral furrows, some- 

 wliat narrower than the intervening cords, on each whorl. Of the four 

 cords, the upper three are equal, the lower one narrower. On the base

there are several spiral grooves, and some finer strise near the axis. A 

 well-grown specimen measures, length 10.5, diam. 2.5 mm. There are 

 about 13 postnepionic whorls. The shell figured is from Hirado, Hizen. 

 Bunker's type was from Deshima (near Nagasaki), also in southwestern 

 Kj'ushu. 



This species is apparently close to C. circinata A. Ad., the type of 

 Cingulina. foimd at Awa-shima, which is known to me by Adams' brief 

 description only. 

 Turbonilla (Cingulina) triarata n. sp. PI. V, fig. 48. 



Shell very slender and long, the leng-th about fom- times the greatest 

 diameter; lateral outlines straight. White, glossy, slightly marked 

 with growth-lines. Sculpture of three spfral grooves on each whorl, the 

 lowest one at the suture below, the other grooves defining three nearly 

 flat spaces, the upper one narrowest, lower widest. Last whorl with 

 the third groove at the periphery, the base convex, very minutely and 

 closely striate spirally. Wliorls 13, besides the elevated planorboid 

 nucleus which stands on edge at the summit. Suture channelled. 



Length 9.5, diam. 2.3 mm.; length of aperture 2.1 mm.

This form must stand near Cingulina japonica Clessin,^* but agrees 

 with neither the description nor figure. Clessin states that his species 

 has a single line running below the suture, the rest of the whorl being 

 <;mooth. but he figures two more spiral lines ; and the last whorl, which 

 he says is subangular below, the base smooth, is figured with 5 spiral 

 lines. The proportions, 11 x 1.9 mm., are more slender than T. tria- 

 rata. One becomes accustomed to such discrepancies in Clessin's 

 work. His ideals of descriptive zoology are not lofty. 



TURBESriD^. 

 CoUonia rosa n. sp. PI. VI. fig. 53. 



Shell obliquely globose-turbinate, narrowly umbilicate, rose-red, 

 with two apical whorls yellow. Sculpture of somewhat unequal spiral 

 <'ords, about as wide as their intervals, and 25 to 27 in number on the 

 last whorl. Several of the cords, at unequal intervals, are slightly larger 

 than the others, and all are nearly smooth except near the suture and 

 umbilicus, where there are short radial folds. Spire short, conic. 

 AVhorls about 4, convex. Aperture but slightly oblique, circular, white, 

 smooth and pearly within. Inner margin of the peristome thick and 

 white. A slightly sinuous cord ascends almost vertically into the

In some of the specimens, especially those not quite mature, there is 

 some white mottling in the peripheral region, and a white area around 

 the umbilicus. The specimens from Tokyo Bay which I provisionally 

 refer to this species want the subsutural and umbilical plication.

TROOHID-SI. 

 Trochus hirasei n. sp. PI. V, figs. 52, 52a. 



Shell imperforate, pyramidal, with the outlines shghtly convex below 

 and noticeabh' concave along the upper half of the spire; base flat. 

 White, with bold radial stripes of blood-red or purplish-red on the later 

 whorls, the spire very minutely and copiously speclded with olive-green 

 and red, the latter color predominating on the spiral cords. Base 

 whitish, tessellated with blood-red oblong spots on the spiral cords. 

 The upper half of the spire is sculptured with short obhquely vertical 

 waves on the lower third of each whorl, terminating in nodes above 

 the suture ; above these waves there are several low, weakly granose 

 spiral cords. The waves gradually diminish on the penultimate 

 whorl and are nearly obsolete on the last, and the spiral cords increase 

 in number and strength. The periphery is acutely angular in front 

 but in fully adult shells becomes blunt behind the hp. The flat 

 base is sculptured with about 12 very low and smoothish circular cords. 

 The aperture is smooth and silvery within. The columella bears an 

 acute lobe above, separated from the base by a deep incision, and it 

 terminates below in an oblong, whitish tubercle. The umbilical 

 region is pearly as usual.

ang'ilar periphery and flat lower surface. It holds a relation toward 

 T. conus somewhat similar to that existing between T. maxinms Koch

This form seems to be identical with T. turris Philippi, Zeitschr. f. 

 Malak., 1846, p. 102 (preoc.) = 2'. altus Phil., Conchyl. Cab., p. 217, PI. 

 32, fig. 7 (not of Perry, 1811). The habitat of Philippi's species was 

 unknown, but Dunker has reported it from the Inland Sea of Japan. 



Four recent species of the typical section of Trochus are now known : 

 T. niloticus, T. maximus, T. conus and T. hirasei.

I formerly figured this under the erroneous name C. turhinatum, but 

 Adams described that species as umbilicate, while this is imperforate. 

 The figures cited above are from specimens from Hakodate, the type 

 locality. The species extends down the ocean coast of Nippon to 

 Sagami Bay, where it has been found at Hayama, near Kamakura, by 

 Miss A. C. Hartshorne. 

 Chlorostoma rugatum sublaevis n. subsp. PI. V, fig. 50. 



Shell imperforate but with a rather deep pit in the place of the filled 

 umbilicus, shaped like C. rugatum or more depressed, slate-black or 

 purplish-black. Upper surface free from oblique corrugation, or unth 

 it only weakly indicated in places. Base weakly sculptured with low 

 spiral cords. Axial callous white, or sometimes green-tinted and with 

 an orange outer border.

 Clanculus hizenensis var. fraterculus n. v. PI. VI, fig. 54. 



The shell is trochiform with flattened base, straightly conic spire 

 and roimded periphery. On a nearly white ground it is radially macu- 

 late with brown on the upper surface, with smaller spots interposed 

 between the others at the peripheral region. The base has paler small 

 spots on the ribs, sometimes partially arranged in radial stripes. The 

 apical H w^horls are uniform, the next whorl irregularly dotted with 

 pink on a pale buff-brown ground. The 5^ or 6 whorls are convex and 

 parted by a narrow, deep suture.

The sculpture is of closely beaded spiral cords, of which there are 

 five on the penultimate and next earlier whorls, the upper three small, 

 the lower two much larger and wider spaced. On the last whorl there 

 is a group of three large cords in the peripheral region, three smaller 

 ones above them; the intervals being densely obhquely striate, with 

 no trace of spiral striae or secondar}^ threads. The base, which is slightly 

 convex, has eight subequal spirals, w^hich are smaller and less deeply 

 cut into beads than those above them. The intervals throughout are 

 about equal in width to the adjacent spiral cords. 



The aperture is very oblique, sulcate within, with 8 to 10 lirae, the 

 bevelled edge fluted. The obhque columella has a low nodule above 

 and a strong tooth at the base. Its edge is flanged outwardly. The 

 rather narrow umbilicus is guarded by about four teeth.

The shell is globose wath conic spire and narrow umbilicus, moder- 

 ately solid, and of a uniform purple-brown color. There are about 5 

 convex whorls parted by a narrow channelled suture. 



The sculpture is of closely beaded spiral cords parted by intervals 

 of about their own width. On the last whorl there are 11 of these 

 primary cords, with, in full-grown shells, a small secondary cord in 

 each interval. The earliest sculptured whorl has three large cords, 

 this number being soon doubled by intercalation of new ones. The 

 intervals are more or less strongly latticed across by threads continuous

This species, in form and sculpture, is much Hke E. atratus (Gm.) on 

 a diminutive scale, but the columellar tooth is far weaker. E. ruber 

 A. Ad., E. gemmatus (Gld). and other small granose species also have 

 a much stronger columellar tooth. 

 Euchelus hacMjoensis n. sp. PL VI, fig. 56. 



Shell globose, with short spire and narrow umbilicus; spirally 

 granose-lirate ; coral-red, sparsely dotted with darker red, usually on 

 alternate spirals above and on all the basal spirals. Whorls 4. convex, 

 the first 1 smooth. 



Sculpture of crowded, closely granose or beaded spirals, 12 or 13 

 in number and subequal on the last whorl, the granules weakly 

 connected across the intervals. On the penultimate whorl the spirals 

 usually alternate in size, as is ordinarily the case in shells where they 

 increase in number by intercalation. The subcircular, oblique aper- 

 ture is smooth or at least not distinctly sulcate inside. The columella 

 is slightly concave and terminates in a very weak tubercle. The 

 umbilicus is bounded by a white rib.

 I do not know of any closely related form. 

 Euchelus (Hyboohelus) oancellatus orientalis n. subsp. PL VI, figs. 57, 57a. 



Shell similar to E. cancellatus of South Africa in form, but differing 

 in having more large spiral cords, 10 at the beginning of the last whorl, 

 each interval bisected by a small thread. Near the end of the whorl 

 some of these threads become nearly as large as the primary cords, and 

 minute threads of a third order appear in some of the intervals. In 

 E. cancellatus there are only 8 primary cords at the beginning of the 

 last whorl, the intervening threads are much larger, and additional 

 threads are intercalated sooner and more numerously. The pits 

 produced by oblique riblets are much narrower in orientalis, the upper 

 series in each pair of intervals are usually subdivided, while in E. 

 cancellatus the pits are regular and uniform,

SIPHONARIID^. 

 Siphonaria subatra n. sp. PI. VI, figs. 61, 61a, 616. 



Shell [oval, thin, with subcentral apex, nearly straight slopes and 

 strongly projecting ''siphon." Dark ashy-brown where eroded in 

 the middle, blackish aroimd the border, and gray or banded with black 

 in the intervening zone; the interior intense black-brown with short 

 white marks at the terminations of the ribs. Sculpture of numerous 

 rather coarse, unequally spaced radial ribs, projecting at the edge, with 

 much finer radial threads between them, several in each interval. 

 The siphonal groove usually continues weakly past the apex of the 

 cavity, its end curving forward.

Shell small, thin, steeply conic, with subcentral summit. The apex 

 is brown, smooth and glossy, Crepidula-shapecl, the tip curving back- 

 ward and to the left. The sculpture is of 20 to 25 unequal rounded 

 radial ribs, of which about half do not extend to the apex. The ribs 

 are whitish-gray, the intervals generally dusky. The ribs irregularly 

 denticulate the margin. The siphonal rib projects moderately, and 

 shows a rather faintly impressed fine along its ridge. The interior 

 is deep-brown or even black-brown within the muscle-impression, and 

 usually striped with brown to or nearly to the edge, between the 

 white rib rays.

Apparently closer related to C. rahdota Westwood than to any other 

 species of the genus. From this it may be separated by the spinose 

 mesonotum, the comparatively shorter limbs, the absence of any very 

 marked appendages to the basal abdominal segments, and the very 

 different character of the apical segments of the abdomen.

 spinulose. Head longitudinal; occiput with a pair of prominent ear- 

 like processes, the extreme posterior margin with a pair of blunt spini-

 strongly depressed. Pronotum slightly longitudinal, saddle-shaped: 

 sm-face strongly tuberculate, a distinct paired series extending on either 

 side of the faint median longitudinal sulcus; anterior margin with a 

 pair of medium size, rounded tubercles; posterior margin with a pair

 expanded centrally ; median portion with a pair of low transverse carini- 

 form lobes; posterior margin with two small pairs of median rounded 

 lobes; lateral borders with a row of low rounded fold-like tubercles.

 notum, immediately anterior to the median segment two low rounded 

 lobes are developed; median segment very small, not one-fifth the 

 length of the whole segment; supra-coxal region of the metathoracic 

 segment margined by a saw-hke series of roimded lobules. Abdomen 

 slightly exceeding the thorax in length, the six basal segments all trans- 

 verse or subtransverse, each segment with the posterior margin with 

 two median pairs of lobules; sixth dorsal segment depressed, laterally 

 supphed with rounded fohaceous expansions; seventh and eighth seg- 

 ments somewhat compressed, subcarinat€, the posterior margins irregu- 

 larly sinuate and serrate ; ninth segment strongly depressed posteriorly, 

 tuberculate, apex with the median portion sinuate; supra-anal plate 

 produced, convex, apex narrowly roimded ; subgenital opercule reaching 

 slightly beyond the apex of the supra-anal plate, longitudinally striate,

 lobe; tibiae about equal to the femora in length, the superior margin 

 w-ith three lobules decreasing in size toward the apex; metatarsi as in 

 the anterior limbs. Posterior femora equal to the four basal joints of 

 the abdomen in length, the superior margin with three large subpyrami- 

 dal lobes, the largest being bilobate and placed at the distal extremity, 

 several small lobules are located between the larger lobes, inferior 

 margins with several small low lobules, the apical larger than any of the 

 others and strongly bilobate; posterior tibiae exceeding the femora 

 by half the length of the fifth abdominal segment, superior surface

The male of this species is, as noted by Saussure,* almost identical 

 with that of D. femorata, but the female can readily be distinguished 

 by the comparatively robust limbs and short conoid cerci. The 

 female from Alt a Mira is interesting, as it possesses two short spinous 

 interocular processes, but is in every other detail perfectly typical of 

 the species. The male from Guaymas has the right anterior limb 

 aborted. Saussiu-e has recorded this species from near Tampico.

Alhed to S. mexicana (Saussure), but differing in the female in the 

 reduced expansion of the fifth abdominal segment, the much longer 

 sixth, and the less compressed seventh, eighth and ninth segments. As 

 the male of mexicana has been imperfectly described, comparison is 

 hardly possible. From S. cetolus (Westwood) it can readily be dis- 

 tinguished by the smaller size and shorter genital opercule.

Apparently closely related to H. mexicana Gray and H. striata (Bur- 

 meister), but differing from the former in the stouter body, longer limbs 

 and different abdominal appendages in the male ; and from striata in 

 the shorter seventh abdominal segment in the male, and the different 

 proportions of the three terminal segments in the female. From H. 

 festuca (Gigho-Tos), another aUy, it can readily be separated by the 

 character of the female subgenital opercule, which is tridentate in 

 festiica.

 ninth segment, compressed, slightly deciuved and provided with a 

 dentiform point at the lower angle of the apical margin; subgenital 

 opercule wdth the apical margin rounded, and provided vnih an acute

One female; Baracoa, Cuba, February 4, 1902. (William Palmer.) 

 [U. S. N. M.] 



As the female of tliis species has never before been recorded, a 

 description may prove of interest. 



Size medium; form elongate; sm-face smooth. Head somewhat 

 longitudinal, depressed, posterior portion constricted; interocular 

 region with several transverse depressions; occiput with a fine longi- 

 tudinal sulcus; eyes globose, very prominent; antennse not quite half 

 as long as the body, basal joint elongate-depressed. Pronotum longi- 

 tudinal, almost twice as long as broad; transverse median depression 

 slightly in advance of the middle; anterior portion with a transverse 

 depression immediately posterior to the anterior margin ; longitudinal 

 median carina slight. Mesonotum nearly six times as long as the 

 pronotum, subequal in wddth except for a sUght anterior constriction 

 and a moderate expansion in the supra-coxal region. Metanotmn 

 (with median segment) three-fifths the length of mesonotum; median 

 segment occupying about three-fifths the leng-th of the whole segment. 

 Abdomen about equal to the thorax in length ; four basal segments 

 longitudinal, equal in size; fifth dorsal segment somewhat inflated 

 apically; sixth segment compressed, tectate, carinate, slightly shorter 

 than the preceding segments in length; seventh and eighth segments 

 subequal in size, tectate, carinate, the posterior portion of the carina 

 produced into a small roimded process ; ninth segment about equal to 

 the eighth in length, tectate, carinate, the lateral aspects each 

 bearing a low boss-like roimded swelling, apical margin with a very 

 shallow emargination, exposing the extreme tip of the supra-anal 

 plate ; cerci not half the length of the ninth dorsal segment, acuminate ; 

 subgenital opercule elongate, attenuate, apex decidedly acmninate, 

 reaching to the apex of the ninth dorsal segment. Anterior femora 

 and tibise compressed, each almost equal to the mesonotum in length; 

 metatarsi equal to the remaining joints in length, superior sm-face 

 with a distinct foliaceous crest. Median femora and tibiae somewhat 



ville, but is usually credited to Latreille. LatreiEe (Fam. Nat. Regn. Anim., p. 

 412, 1825) published simply the French form Bacterie, and included no species 

 under it. In 1807, Latreille (Gen. Crust, et Insect., Ill, pp. 87-8S) diA^ded the 

 scfnus Phasma into two sections, the first of which he .subdivided, and it was on 

 the second division of tlie first section that Lepeletier and Serville based their 

 genus. This di\'ision included three species, all of Fabricius, filiformis, ferula 

 and calamus. As the identification of these names is rather uncertain, I have 

 selected ferula as the type, as it is usually considered a svnonvm of arumatia 

 StoU, which is based on a figure.

Type.— d" ; Adjimtas, Porto Rico, April 12, 1900. (Dr. C. W. Rich- 

 mond.) [Cat. No. 7,344, U. S. N. M.] 



Compared with jamaicensis Tfrwcy, the closest allied species, this new 

 form may be separated by the imarmed head and mesonotum, the 

 longer tegmina, the slenderer and weaker limbs, and the coloration. It 

 appears very unhkely that this is the male of angulata Stoll ( = mi- 

 cropterus Lep. and Serv.), as the female of that species has verj'- promi- 

 nent cephahc spines, and in all respects resembles the females of other 

 species of the genus, the kno^Ti males of which are very different from 

 this in structm^e. Stoll's species was recorded from Porto Rico by 

 Haan,22 but there appears no hkelihood that this new form is at all 

 closely allied to it. 



Size rather small; form moderately elongate; siu-face subglabrous. 

 Head ovate, depressed; occiput without spines; eyes subglobose. 

 Antennae equal to the head, thorax and tegmina in length, robust, fili- 

 form, basal joint depressed, the inferior siu-face concave. Pronotum 

 subquadrate, somewhat constricted posteriorly, anterior margin con- 

 cave, the posterior convex; transverse anterior sulcus obsolete cen- 

 trally, transverse median sulcus distinct, strongly impressed, 

 longitudinal median sulcus slight, not extending the whole 

 length of the pronotiun. Mesonotum sHghtly over three times the 

 length of the pronotmn, gradually expanding posteriorly, surface with 

 several irregular obsolete tubercles. Metanotum equal to the meso- 

 notima in length; metathoracic pleura and metastemum rugulose; 

 the whole metathorax depressed. Tegmina equal to the mesonotum 

 in length, acute-ovate; median protuberance somewhat longitudinal, 

 acute. Wings long, reaching to the seventh abdominal segment. 

 Abdomen with all the segments more or less longitudinal, gradually 

 decreasing in size from the base to the sixth segment ; sixth and follow- 

 ing segments distinctly carinate and tectate; seventh and eighth seg- 

 ments of the same general form, the latter slightly the shorter ; ninth 

 segment slightly shorter than the eighth segment, somewhat con- 

 stricted toward the apex, apical margin subtruncate with a very broad 

 and shallow median emargination ; cerci about two-thirds the length, 

 subequal, apex blunt ; subgenital opercule very shghtly exceeding the 

 apical margin of the eighth dorsal segment, cymbiform, carinate, apex 

 roimded with a narrow median triangiilar emargination. Anterioi- 

 femora equal to the pronotum and mesonotum in length, basal flexure

 but shghtly more than half the length of the remaining tarsal joints. 

 ]\Iedian femora a trifle longer than the tegmina, anterior inferior margin 

 with two and the posterior inferior margin with one apical spine, 

 median line with one spine which is more or less obsolete; tibiae con- 

 siderably shorter than the femora and almost equalling the mesonotum 

 in length; metatarsi equalled in length by the second and third tarsal 

 joints. Posterior femora equal to the first, second and half of the third 

 abdominal segment, anterior inferior margin with two and the posterior 

 with one apical spine, median line with two subapical spines; tibiae 

 about three-fourths the length of the femora; metatarsi equal to the 

 second, third and fourth tarsal joints in length. 



General color pale yellowdsh-green, washed with brownish on the 

 head, pronotum and mesonotum; tcgmina and wings with the veins 

 darker than the basic color, costal margin of the tegmina and the base 

 of the same region of the wing opaque-white, discoidal area of the teg- 

 mina smoky-brown, posterior field of the tegmina milky-white; an-

This specimen does not wholly agree with Bolivar's description of 

 the species, differing in the bowed median and posterior femora, in 

 which respect it approaches B. welvntschi Bohvar {ihid., p. 88) from 

 Golungo Alto, but from that is separated by the character of the ceph-

 a very distinct form.

One male; Trong, Lower Siam. (Dr. W. L. Abbott.) [U. S. N. M.] 

 This specimen agrees perfectly with Westwood's figure, except that 



the ninth abdominal segment is very slightly shorter and the two arms 



of the same less cm-ved. 



2^ As Bome orthopterists do not recognize this genus as distinct from Palophus 

 Westwood, and both names being ostensibly published in 1859, the author ex- 

 amined the works containing each, to ascertain, if possible, which had priority. 

 Stil's work was presented for publication in 1858, but ob\'iously did not appear 

 until 1859, the copy, of the work in the librarj' of the Academy having been re- 

 ceived May 22, 1860 ; and while the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Lon- 

 don give no clue as to the date of receipt of the 185S volume, the 1859 volume is 

 stated to have been received during 1860. Assuming the numbers to have ap- 

 peared regularly, this would place the 1858 portion as appearing during 1859. 

 Westwood's work, bearing the date June 1, 1859, on tlie Preface, was received 

 at the Academy January- 10, 1860, but is not mentioned in the Proceedings of 

 the Entomological Society of London until August 6, 1860. In the Proceedings of 

 the Boston Society of Natural History, the 1858 Ofversigt is entered as received 

 between April and June 30, 1860. From the above it will be seen that the dates 

 . of publication are very close, and the question of priority is one I am unable to 

 Bettle at present.

Genus ORXINES Stil. 

 1875. Orxines Stal, Recensio Orthopterorum, III, pp. 43 and S7,

 selected as the type, as Westwood has given good figures of both sexes.

 Four specimens; one male, three females; Island of Obi, ^Moluccas. 

 [Coll. of Mr. Morgan Hebard and Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.] 



These specimens differ slightly from Westwood's figures, the meso- 

 notiun and metanotimi (without the median segment) being slightly 

 longer, but the discrepancies are so slight it would be very difficult to 

 satisfactorily differentiate them from the Amboina form.

This specimen, which otherwise agrees very well with Stal's descrip-

 tion. The median tibia? are exceptionally short, but Stal makes no 

 mention of this rather striking condition.

One female; Island of Obi, ^loluccas. [Coll. of ^lorgan Hel:)ard.] 



This agrees perfectly with Bates' description, except that the general 



tint of the limbs is more brownish than greenish, but this of course may 



be due to drying, StM's maculiceps and thishc from the Philippines^* 



appear to be closety related to this species.

 [Gaolo and Batchian.] (■^) 



Eight specimens; four males, four females; Island of Obi, iloluccas. 

 [A. N. S. Phila. and collection of Morgan Hebard.] 



It appears to me that the above names were based on different 

 sexes of the same species. The specimens examined agree almost 

 absolutely with the descriptions, and such characters as the annulation 

 of the antennse and the structure of the pronotiun and the head, as well 

 as the extent of the rugosity of the mesonotum, are identical in the two 

 sexes. Bates says the tegmina of the male ''are of a yellowish coloiu", 

 bro^Ti towards their tips, but sometimes imiform yellow." All the 

 four males examined have the coloration imiform. 



The rugosity of the mesonotmn of both sexes is distinctly more pro- 

 nounced anteriorly, which also holds true regarding the mesosternmn. 



The rangfi of this species now covers Gilolo, Batchian and Obi, of 

 the Moluccan group.

One female ; Trong, Lower Siam. (Dr. ^Y. L. Abbott.) [U. S. X. M.] 

 After critically examining the figm-es of Westwood's maculicollis 

 and Brimner's atrosignata, there appears to be no doubt but that they 

 are based on the same species. Brmmer's specimens are described as 

 being more uniform in the coloration of the costal portion of the 

 wings, but the Trong specimen agrees exactly vnih Westwood's figure. 

 This species has been recorded from Java by Westwood and Siunatra 

 by Brunner, as well as from the localities mentioned above.

These specimens agree fairly well with Stal's very brief description, 

 but that individuals from the two localities are identical is, to say the 

 least, doubtful. A very peculiar feature of these individuals is the 

 continuous ventral line extending from the prosternum to the apical 

 portion of the abdomen. Several other species related to this form are 

 sarpedon and samsoo Westwood, and possibly janus Bates and ceramia

Types. — c? and 9 ; Island of Obi, Moluccas. [A. N. S. Phila., pre- 

 sented by Mr. Morgan Hebard.] 



As this species does not appear to be closely related to an 5^ of the 

 previously known species, I have compared it with the type of the 

 genus. The new form differs from S. sipylus in the smaller size, the 

 very weak character of the granulations on the mesonotum, the some- 

 what slenderer and less coriaceous tegmina, the blunter character of 

 the apex of the ninth dorsal abdominal segment and the more acumi- 

 nate apical portion of the subgenital opercule. 



c?. — Size medium; form elongate; surface smooth. Head shghtly 

 oblong, dorsal surface fiat, the occiput with a slight median longi- 

 tudinal sulcus; eyes ovate, prominent; antennae slightly exceeding the 

 body in length. Pronotum longitudinal, about twice as long as broad, 

 subequal in width, transverse sulcus in advance of the middle. Meso- 

 notum about three and a half times the length of the pronotum, very 

 slender, very slightly constricted centrally ; surface with a few obsolete 

 granulations and a weak longitudinal median carina. Tegmina ovate, 

 the apex sub-truncate, median protuberance of medium height and 

 rather blunt. Wings equal to the mesonotum and about two-thirds the 

 abdomen in length. Abdomen with the seventh and eighth segments 

 subequal in length, and exceeding the ninth, which is somewhat tectate 

 and apically subtruncate with a very shallow median emargination ; 

 cerci short, stout, subequal, extending but shghtly beyond the ninth 

 dorsal segment; subgenital opercule not quite reaching the apex of the 

 eighth dorsal segment, moderately compressed, apex rather broadly 

 rounded. Limbs very slender. Anterior femora equal to about half 

 the length of the abdomen, basal flexure slight; tibia; about equal to 

 the femora in length; metatarsi considerably exceeding the remaining 

 joints in length. Median femora equal to the mesonotum and tegmina 

 in length; tibiae slightly shorter than the femOra in length; metatarsi 

 very slightly longer than the remaining tarsal joints. Posterior femora 

 about equal to the anterior femora in length; tibiae equal to the femora 

 in length; metatarsi exceeding the remaining tarsal joints in length. 



9 .— Size medium. Head suboval, not constricted posterior to the 

 eyes; occiput with a distinct longitudinal median sulcus; eyes ovate; 

 antennas about two-thirds the length of the body. Pronotum as in 

 the male, but the transverse sulcus is not so anterior in position. 

 Mesonotum three times the length of the pronotum, slightly expanduig 

 posteriorly, median carina very fine, subobsolete. Tegmina ovate,

the apex somewhat truncate; costal region very broadly arcuate; 

 median protuberance longitudinal, low and rounded. Wings equal 

 to the abdomen in length; when in repose the tips are distinctly acumi- 

 nate. Abdomen with the seventh, eighth and ninth dorsal segments 

 subequal in length, the latter subtectate and distinctly acuminate; 

 subgenital opercule acuminate, reaching to the middle of the ninth dor- 

 sal segment. Anterior femora slightly compressed, almost equal to 

 the head, pronotum and mesonotum in length; tibiae slightly shorter 

 than the femora. Median femora equal to the mesonotum and half 

 pf the pronotum in length; tibiae about J&ve-sixths the length of the 

 femora; metatarsi but slightty shorter than the remaining tarsal joints. 

 Posterior femora about as long as the head, pronotiun and mesonotum; 

 tibiae equal to the femora. 



General color pea-green, dark dull in the female. Antennae greenish- 

 brown, with the base of each joint encircled by a narrow whitish annu- 

 lus, this latter character more apparent in the male than in the female. 

 Pronotum in the male flecked with small circular blotches of cream. 

 Tegmina and costal region of wings pea-green, in the female the tips 

 of the latter touched with rosy red; posterior field of the wings pale

This species has two well-marked color phases, one pea-green, the 

 other dull wood-brown. The males all belong to the latter phase, and 

 have the internal edge of the tegmina and the internal edge of the basal 

 portion of the wings with a rather broad longitudinal bar of dull 

 yellowish. 



The following description is of the male, which appears never to have 

 been recorded.

 depressed, posterior portion of subequal width; occiput with a very 

 deep longitudinal sulcus ; eyes subovate ; ocelli distinct ; antennae equal 

 to the body in length. Pronotum distinctly longitudinal, twice as long 

 as broad ; anterior margin broadly emarginate, posterior margin broadly 

 arcuate, lateral margins bearing a rather acute process anteriorly; 

 transverse sulci two in number, one immediately posterior to the ante- 

 rior margin, the other just anterior to the middle. >\Iesonotum dis- 

 tinctly tuberculate (a condition shared by the meso- and metasternum 

 and pleura), slender, subequal; median carina rather broad, low.

 in width ; median protuberance very distinct. Wings about twice the 

 length of the head, pronotum and mesonotum together. Abdomen 

 mth the seventh and eighth dorsal segments subequal in length, cari- 

 nate, the ninth shghtly shorter than the eighth, apical emargination very 

 deep, expanded, the lateral portions incurved and enclosing the expanded 

 sinus ; cerci subequal in width, not quite equal to the ninth segment in 

 length ; subgenital opercule reaching to the tip of the eighth dorsal seg- 

 ment, cymbiform, apex narrowly rounded. Anterior femora with the 

 basal flexure moderately distinct, equal to the head, pronotum,' meso- 

 notum and tegmina in length; tibias equal to the femora in length; 

 metatarsi nearly twdce as long as the following tarsal joint. Median 

 femora equal to the pronotimi and mesonotum in length ; tibiae some- 

 what shorter than the femora; metatarsi about equal to the remaining 

 tarsal joints in length. Posterior femora and tibiae about equal to the 

 anterior in length; metatarsi slightly longer than the remaining tarsal 

 joints. 



General color dull wood-brown, blotched and suffused with dull 

 ochraceous, the limbs obscurely annulate. Tegmina with a spot on 

 the median protuberance and the internal border as well as the adjoin- 

 ing portion of the wings dull yellow; posterior field of wings vinaceous. 

 -Antennae dull l^rownish-ochraceous with obsolete annuli of a dark 

 brown.

first to sixth segments distinctly longitudinal; seventh dorsal segment 

 not more than two-thirds the length of the sixth; eighth segment 

 tectate, shghtly shorter than the seventh, lateral portions with the 

 posterior angles simple and not developed into distinct spines; ninth 

 segment shghth' shorter than the eighth, fornicate, apically trimcate 

 and -u-ith a transverse costa, median carina narrow and distinct; cerci 

 about equal in length to the ninth dorsal segment, and inserted near 

 the apex of the latter, slender, hardly curved; subgenital opercule not 

 quite reaching the apical margin of the eighth dorsal segment, apex

 size is greater.

Type. — Gratidia sansihara Stal. 



As the material studied in this connection was quite limited, no 

 attempt has been made to determine the propriety of uniting Clonaria 

 with Gratidia, as Karsch has proposed to do in his paper on this genus.^^ 

 The relegating of Paraclonaria to the synonymy seems unwarranted, 

 in spite of the arguments Karsch advances in defense of his action. 

 The structural characters of Paraclonaria are of sufficient importance

These specimens agree very well wdth Karsch's description, except 

 for the fact that he gives the length of the anal segment as 7.5 milli- 

 meters, while in the specimens examined the plate itself is considerably 

 shorter than the type measurements. Possibly personal equation or 

 a different comprehension of the ''analsegment" may be responsible

Stoll's description of rosea^^ from Amboina is so brief that even with 

 the aid of his figure httle can be made out of it. It is very apparent, 

 however, that it has much longer wings than apalamnus, which latter 

 has very short wings in both sexes. 



cJ*. — Size rather small; form moderately elongate; surface glabrous. 

 Head very large, almost twice the width of the pronotum, oblong, 

 slightly and evenly constricted in the posterior portion; occiput with 

 a broad shallow longitudinally disposed sulcus, another of similar 

 character extending posteriorly from the eye and another on the side 

 of the head; ocelli obsolete; eyes hemispherical; antennae slender, 

 filiform, about equal to the anterior femora in length. Pronotum 

 oblong, about twice as long as broad, very slightly broader anteriorly 

 than posteriorly, transverse sulcus centrally placed, lateral portions 

 with a broad shallow longitudinal depression extending almost the 

 entire length, ]\Iesonotum slender, slightly expanding anteriorly and 

 posteriorly, over three times the length of the pronotum, surface obso- 

 letely tuberculate; median carina replaced by a very weak sulcus. 

 Tegmina ovate; apex rounded; median protuberance extremely low; 

 venation very irregular and somewhat reticulate in character. Wings 

 short, not reaching to the middle of the third abdominal segment; 

 costal and mediastinal regions with the transverse nervures distinct 

 and parallel. Abdomen bacilliform; eighth dorsal abdominal segment 

 slightly longer than the seventh, both of which are somewhat tectate ; 

 ninth segment compressed, carinate, apical incision deep and circular, 

 the inferior lateral lobes strongly dentate; cerci about equal to the 

 ninth segment in length, filiform, apex acuminate; subgenital opercule 

 reaching to the tip of the eighth dorsal segment, cymbiform, the apex 

 moderately acuminate. Limbs rather slender. Anterior femora equal 

 in length to the head, pronotum, mesonotimi and tegmina, basal flexiu-e 

 slight, apical portion of the inferior surface with four spines; tibiae 

 slightly longer than the femora; metatarsi half again as long as the 

 remaining tarsal joint. Median femora equal to the mesonotum and 

 half of the pronotum in length, apical spines four in number, three 

 placed anteriorly, one posteriorly; tibiae equal to the femora in 

 length; metatarsi slightly longer than the remaining tarsal joints. 

 Posterior femora slightly shorter than the four basal abdominal seg-

One of these specimens has the right anterior limb regenerated, the 

 whole leg not equalling the normal left femur in length. The syn- 

 onymy of this species is very much involved, but after considerable 

 study ncevia seems to be the correct name. 



Sharp^*' has given some space to a discussion of the names of the 

 species of the genus, but as he did not have the Moluccan form, the 

 question as to a name for it was left unsettled. The nominal species 

 known to date are as follows : 



Anchiale ncsvia (Lichtenstein). Amboina and Obi. 



Anchiale stolli Sharp. New^ Britain. 



Anchiale conjusa Sharp. New Britain (Westwood credits this form, 

 which he calls maculata, to the Sandwich Islands) . 



The insect figured and described by Blanchard" from Warou, on the 

 coast of Ceram, may represent a distinct form.

Two specimens, male and female; Trong, Lower Siam. (Dr. W. L. 

 Abbott.) [U. S. N. M.] 



The male of this species has never been described, and appears 

 to be remarkable for the great length of the tegmina and wings. 

 It resembles the male of mulleri Haan closer than any other species the 

 male of which is known. From mulleri it can readily be distinguished 

 by the shorter mesonotum, the longer tegmina (55 mm.) and wings 

 (70 mm.), and the more ample lateral flaps of the seventh and eighth 

 abdominal segments. 



The range of the genus Heteropteryx covers Malacca and Trong {dila- 

 tata, castelnaudii, rollandi), Sumatra (millleri), Java (rosenbergi) , 

 Borneo (grayii, dehaanii and dilatata), Celebes (icestivoodii) and Aus-

Closely allied to D. 7nouhotii Bates^^ from Cambodia, but differing in 

 the peculiar form of the ninth dorsal abdominal segment, and the almost 

 entire absence of oblique ridges on the abdominal segments. The 

 Javan and Malaccan oileus Westwood, rather curiously, is not at all 

 closely allied. 



Size small; form elongate, tectatc, subequal; surface obscurely 

 tuberculate. Head subequal in width, slightly longitudinal; occiput 

 elevated and bearing two converging cristate crenulate ridges, which, 

 when united posteriorly, forrn a jagged projecting lobe; interocular 

 region with a structure somewhat similar to that found on the occiput, 

 but on a smaller scale, the ridges not meeting posteriorly and being 

 trituberculate, the anterior tubercle developed into a distinct curved

 more than one-fourth of the whole metanotal length. Abdomen 

 almost equal to the head and thorax in length, subequal in width, all 

 segments transverse, the oblique lateral Hnes present in the other 

 species of the genus subobsolete; median carina very distinct on the 

 fourth and eighth segments, bifurcate on the former, cristate on the 

 latter; ninth dorsal abdominal segment basally rectangular, the pos- 

 terior median portion produced into a subtriangular process, the apex 

 of which is trvmcato-emarginate ; subgenital opercule reaching to the 

 apex of the eighth dorsal segment, carinate, produced, the apex 

 rounded. Limbs short and stout. Anterior femora about three-fomths 

 the length of the mesonotum, basal flexure slight, but occupying 

 half the entire length, dorsal carina high; tibia3 shghtly shorter than 

 the femora; metatarsi not exceeding the succeeding joint in length. 

 Median femora slightly shorter than the metanotmn in length, superior 

 margin obscurely trilobate; tibise slightly shorter than the femora;

Closely related to P. urazi Bolivar^* from the Rio Atalapo, but differ- 

 ing in the hyaline posterior field of the wings, the longer mesonotum, 

 and the different proportions of the limbs. 



Bolivar's P. perezi*^ from Coca, Ecuador, also appears to be an allied 

 species. 



Size rather large; form very slender and elongate. Head consider- 

 ably longer than the pronotum, very slightly constricted posteriorly; 

 eyes ovate; antenna with each joint somewhat thickened apically, 

 basal joint oblong, slightly depressed. Pronotum not quite half the 

 length of the mesonotum, almost twice as long as broad, subequal, 

 anterior and posterior margins subtruncate; anterior angles with a 

 slight emargination caused by a distinct spiraculous aperture; cruci- 

 form depression slightly marked. Mesonotum rather elongate, sub- 

 equal in width ; lateral margins each with a distinct longitudinal carina ; 

 median portion with a constant slight longitudinal sulcus ; surface of the 

 anterior three-fifths sprinkled with roimded tubercles, surface of the 

 posterior two-fifths smooth ; mesosternum obscurely tuberculate with 

 a distinct, though irregular, longitudinal carina. Metathorax equal to 

 the mesothorax in length; metasternum strongly longitudinal, and 

 bearing a distinct, but very narrow, median sulcus. Tegmina slightly 

 over three-fourths the length of the mesonotum, subrectangular, the 

 apical margin obliquely truncate; costal margin arcuate; anal margin 



^^The name Pseudophasma was proposed almost simultaneously by both 

 Kirby and Bolivar, the former to replace Phasma of authors, the latter to desig- 

 nate a new genus near to the one Kirby renamed. Considerable trouble was 

 experienced in ascertaining the exact dates of the respective papers. Kirby's 

 article (supra, pp. 447-475) was read December 5, 1895, and in the contents of 

 the volume the date July, 1896, is given. Bolivar's paper (Adas Soc. Espan. 

 Hist. Nat., XXV, pp. 11-18) was presented January 8, 1896, and tlie date of 

 publication of the part is given on the cover sheet as September 30, 1896. From 

 tlie Zoologischer Anzeiger (Bibliographia Zoolngica, I, pp. 552 and 650) we learn 

 that Kirbv's paper was received first, and tlii.s no doubt has priority of a month 

 at least. "Accordingly Bolivar's Pseudopha-^iun requires another name, and I 

 propose Ignacia, as a slight tribute to the worth of a master mind.

 This specimen appears to be referable to this species, though differing 

 considerably in coloration from the descriptions. The S-shaped mark 

 on the tegmina is but httle crved, while the posterior part of the 

 tegmina is as black as the general color of the insect. The wings also 

 carry a longitudinal dull ochraceous line along the greater portion of

 former it differs in the absence of distinct spines on the head, the more 

 ovate tegmina, the much longer wings, the slightly longer mesonotum 

 and the lobate posterior femora. From the latter it differs in the larger

The female from Buitenzorg has the tegmina and limbs wood-brown, 

 while the body is faded greenish. Information with the sjoecimen 

 states the color is due to imperfect drying. While this is c^uite likely

This specimen differs slightly from the figure given by Westwood,®" 

 the apex of the abdomen being more constricted, in fact somewhat 

 approaching pulchrifolium in this respect. After carefully examining 

 the literature, it appears very niuch as if the scythe and pulchrifolium 

 were simply geographic races of the same species, the Trong specimen 

 being a direct intermediate, both structurally and geographically. 

 Gray's reference of Haan's figure®^ of pulchrifolium to scythe appears 

 erroneous, as the form of the abdomen and almost all the acces- 

 sory lobes of the limbs represent true pulchrifolium. The Trong 

 specimen has the right posterior limb regenerated and about one-fifth 

 the normal size.

Another specimen, a very immature female, from Ivliow Sai Dow, 

 Trong, collected in January or February, 1899, by Dr. Abbott, may 

 be referable to this species, but considering the condition of the 

 specimen a positive determination is impossible. 



Remarks on the General System of the Family. 



While not prepared to bring forward any very radical departures 

 from Brunner's table of the divisions of this group,^^ it may not be out 

 of place to mention the impressions received while studying the 

 material here^dth recorded. Brunner's Lonchodidw, Bacuficulidce and 

 Bacteridce appear to be much closer related than his arrangement would 

 lead one to suppose. The Heteroneminoe {Bacunculidce Brunner) is 

 very close to the Bacterince; in fact, it is extremely difficult to settle 

 into which division to put certain genera, and this is so marked that 

 Kirby has transferred some genera placed by Brunner \wi\\c Bacunculidai 

 to the Bacterince. 



The genera Phyllium and Chitoniscus are such extremel}' aberrant 

 types that the division including them should have higher taxonomic 

 rank than generally accorded to it. 



Laying aside the question as to whether the divisions should be of 

 family or subfamily rank, it appears evident that Brunner's Lon- 

 chodidce, BacunculidcB and Bacteridce are simply divisions of a group 

 not exceeding in rank the well-marked NecroscidcB. Again, the 

 PhyllidcB should have a rating practically equal to the other members 

 of the "Phasmodea," a position warranted by its extreme differentia- 

 tion.

 so that members of the Canadian zone flora are able to grow, while a 

 few hundred yards away the dry bluffs possess a tjq^icall}^ austral and 

 xerophytic assemblage of plants. As a result of these conditions the 

 locahty, taken as a whole, is remarkably rich in species of both plants 

 and animals. The roads and cultivated fields are skirted by oak- 

 bushes, including the peculiar Quercus' havardi Rydberg, only knoT^^l 

 previously from Texas. Roses are abimdant, and a few species of 

 cUmbing plants (Clematis ligiistici f olia 'Nutt., Humulus lupulus neo- 

 mexicanus Nelson and Ckll., Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planch) 

 are very conspicuous. The common weeds include Grindelia inornata 

 Greene, Lathyrus decaphyllus Pursh, Argentinian anscrina (L.), Vicia 

 americana ^luhl., Salsola tragus L., Anogra coronopifolia (T. and G.), 

 Verbascum thapsus L., Erodium cicutarium (L.), Physalis pubescens L., 

 Allionia viscida (Oxybaphus angustifolius var. viscidus Eastwood, Pr. 

 Cal. Ac. Sd., 1896, p. 313), Solatium jamesii Torrey, Helianthus petio- 

 laris Nutt., H . annuus L., etc.- Quite a surprise was the discovery of 

 a large quantity of Chrysanthemum leucanthemum in a field on the Kin 

 Kale Ranch, this plant being hitherto imknown in New Mexico. The 

 SLU^tral Solanum elceagnifolium was seen growing near Harrison's Store,

while Sophia halictorum Ckll. (with the beetle Phyllotreta pusilla Horn, 

 living upon it), occupied the roofs of adobe houses in the village. At 

 the Old Pecos Pueblo, a few miles to the south, we foimd Astragalus 

 simulans Ckll., hitherto only knowTi from Las Vegas. Malva strum 

 cockerelli A. Nelson, was very common on the I\in Kale Ranch; so 

 also was the beautiful Touterea rushyi (Wooton). Fallugia acuniiimta 

 {F. paradoxa acuminata Wooton) and F. acuminata micrantha {F. 

 micrantha Ckll.) formed large patches, and were very attractive to 

 insects. The scarlet Castilleia integra Gray, with the large-bracted 

 form intermedia Ckll., were very conspicuous. A single plant of Datura 

 tatula L., is worth recording; it is, of course, an accidental introduc- 

 tion. Onosmodium thurberi Gray, grew in some quantity by the Pecos 

 river. 



Spending a summer in this beautiful place, I took the opportunity 

 to study the native roses. The result of this study is here presented, 

 not because I have reached any final or dogmatic opinions, but because 

 it seems that field-study in many different localities is the only method 

 whereby the species of the group Cinnamomese will ever be understood. 

 When we have accumulated a sufficient number of observations on the 

 living plants, some talented botanist may find himself able to tell us 

 what they all mean; but for the present observations are perhaps of 

 more consequence than deductions. 



A large part of the material studied was collected and brought to 

 me in the living state by Dr. M. Grabham, of Jamaica, who spent part 

 of the summer at Pecos. I was able to distinguish three main forms, 

 two of which are here introduced as new. While it is difficult, if not 

 impossible, to state definitely how many valid species exist among the 

 Cinnamomese, it seems much better to designate the recognizable forms 

 by name, than to lump them indiscriminately under the few specific 

 titles. It is just this process of lumping which has made so much con- 

 fusion, the same name being applied to a different plant by each of 

 several authors. The characters of the three forms referred to may 

 best be set forth in parallel columns.

All these plants have dull green foliage, not shiny, as Elias Nelson 

 describes R. tvoodsii. This also separates them from R. neomexicana 

 Ckll., of southern New Mexico, described in Entomological News, Febru- 

 ary, 1901, p. 41.^ This Rosa neomexicana is further distinguished by 

 the oblong fruits, which are small and scarlet, with persistent erect 

 sepals. It also has normally pairs of infrastipular spines, and mostly 

 solitary flowers. 



Rosa pecosensis is one of the most beautiful roses known to me. The 

 type was collected by my wife and Dr. Grabham, about six miles up the 

 canon above the Kin Kale Ranch, June 1, 1903; but the plant is also 

 common down as far as the village of Pecos. When the flowers first 

 open the petals are depressed, so that they lie below the plane, the 

 surface of the flower becoming convex. A curious character observed 

 is the presence of a deep notch, in one petal only, always an inner one. 

 The flowers vary in size down to about 42 mm. diameter, or occasion- 

 ally only 37 mm. 



If the three roses described above always held their characters, there 

 would be no hesitation about regarding them as distinct species. Speci- 

 mens occur, however, which vary in different ways, and some of them

 Phila., but was transferred to the News, for wliich it is altogether too botanical. 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



appear to connect the main types. It is possible that this may in part 

 be the result of hybridization, but we are not entitled to assimie this 

 without better evidence. The observed variations are as follows: 

 Rosa pecosensis. 



(1) Upper Pecos-town, June 19. Flowers very fragrant, about 37 

 mm. diameter; sepals entire, rarely with linear lobes; leaflets minutely 

 resin-dotted beneath; leaflets on basal sheets sometimes eleven. In- 

 fested sparingly by Eidecanium. 



(2) Kin Kale Ranch, June 21 (Grabham). Flowers bright pink, not 

 so dark as some; 45 mm. diameter; no strongly notched petal; sepals 

 rarely with hnear lobes ; stipules 5 mm. broad or rather more ; leaflets 7. 



(3) Kin Kale Ranch, June 21. (Grabham.) As usual, except that 

 the sepals sometimes show some marginal red knobbed gland-hairs. 



(4) Kin Kale Ranch, June 21. (Grabham.) Flowers very deep 

 red ; outer sepals with quite a number of red gland-hairs ; midribs of 

 leaflets beneath with scattered very short and minute red gland-hairs ; 

 leaf-margins inclined to be doubly serrate, the secondary serrations 

 gland-tipped; leaflets almost sessile; flowers single. This is in many 

 respects like the R. arkansana var. a, and could be a hybrid, if hybrids 

 occur. 



(5) Kin Kale Ranch, June 21. (Grabham.) Typical, but stipules 

 variable up to 8 mm. broad. 



(6) Kin Kale Ranch, June 21. (Grabham.) Flowers paler, rose- 

 pink, about 36 mm. diameter; leaves unusually large (upper lateral 

 leaflets up to 33 mm. long) ; midribs of leaflets lanulose beneath, with 

 only rudimentary gland-hairs; leaflets deeply and simply notched; 

 sepals lanulose, not glandular, with linear lateral lobes; flowers solitary 

 or in pairs; stigmas j^ellowish in rather advanced bud. This is essen- 

 tially pecosensis, the only material difference being in the paler flowers. 

 Seen from a distance, the flowers of R. pecosensis always appear single, 

 as one bud of a pair comes out before the other. The plants are some- 

 times infested by prickly leaf-galls, of the species Rhodites spinosellus 

 Ckll. 



Bosa praetincta. 



No varieties were found. In Watson's table this species runs to R. 

 hlanda, except that the sepals are not entire. In Crepin's table it also 

 runs to hlanda, except that the flowers are comparatively small. There 

 is no R. hlanda in New Mexico, however. 

 Rosa arkansana var. a. 



I had considered this to be the true R. jendleri of Crepin, not of S. 

 Watson. Dr. Rydberg, to whom I sent a copy of my description, wrote 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



that he could not agree with this, but that I apparently had the long- 

 lost R. arkansana Porter, only certainly known by the original col- 

 lection by Brandegee. As this seems reasonable, I provisionally call 

 my plant arkansana, the more willingly since the name has priority over 

 fendleri, supposing them to refer to one species. The material described 

 above grows b}^ a small irrigation ditch in open unshaded ground, which 

 except for the ditch is very dry. On August 13 a fruiting bush of the 

 same species was found close to the Pecos river, more or less in the 

 shade. It possessed the following characters : 



Fruit very shiny, smooth, globose (long. 9^, lat. 9, to long. 12, lat. 

 10 mm.), slightly longer than broad, without the slightest indication of 

 a neck. Sepals erect, 15 mm. long, some with linear lobes ; the margins 

 woolty, the dorsal surface with loose arachnoid hairs and scattered 

 gland-hairs. Peduncles perfectly glabrous and somewhat glaucous, 

 5-10 mm. long. Infrastipular spines variable, jDresent or absent. 

 Spines on flowering branchlets straight. Stipules very narrow, diam- 

 eter 2-4 mm., beneath with loose arachnoid hairs and short reddish- 

 gland-hairs; petioles minutelj^ pubescent, with scattered short red 

 gland-hairs; leaflets 7 to 9, rather narrow {e.g., long. 23, lat. 124 mm.), 

 resin-dotted beneath, simply toothed, edges not glandular, lateral 

 leaflets briefly petiolulate. A low bush. 



It will be seen that this in many respects approaches R. pccosensis. 

 R. arkansana, var. a, was infested bj' an aphid, which appears to be 

 identical with Myzus rosarum Walker. 



In order to appreciate the characters of the Pecos roses, it is neces- 

 sary to review the described North American species of the same group, 

 and also certain forms occurring in other parts of New ^Mexico. 



The Described Species. 



(1) Rosa grosseserrata E. Nelson. 



Bot. Gaz., August, 1900, p. 119. 



Type from the Yellowstone Park, collected in fruit. I am indebted 

 to Prof. Avcn Nelson for a specimen. This is quite like typical R. 

 pecosensis in the serrations and pubescence of the leaves; the serrations 

 are long and pointed, perfectly simple and not glandular. The stipules 

 are broader than in pccosensis. The fruit is considerably larger, about 

 12 mm. diameter. The author of this species-name thinks the plant 

 is intermediate between R. pisocarpa and R. woodsii, and I believe^ 

 that it is not so close to pccosensis as the resemblance of the lea^•es 

 might suggest. The absence of paired infrastipular spines or prickles 

 seems to remove R. grosseserrata from the vicinity of R. pisocarpa antl 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



ivoodsii, but I am convinced that the vahie of this character has been 

 much exaggerated, Crepin in his table (1896) indicates the variabihty 

 of pisocarpa in this respect. 



(2) E. arkansana Porter. 



Much emphasis has been placed upon the statement in the original 

 description that the sepals are reflexed in fruit. This seems to dis- 

 tinguish my plant from the true arkansana (the fruit was unknown 

 when' I consulted Dr. Rydberg), but I strongly suspect that, as is usual 

 in the group, the sepals are more or less reflexed at first, but ultimately 

 erect. Another discrepancy is in the leaflets, which are 9 to 11 in true 

 arkansana, but 7 to 9 in my plant. The other characters seem very 

 similar in both plants. 



(3) E. fendleri Crepin. 



I regret very much that I cannot make sm-e of fendleri, but this is 

 perhaps not sm-prising, as Cre]3in himself did not know what to do wdth 

 it twenty years after its description. Dr. Rydberg writes: "My idea 

 oilRJjendleri is a low shrub ^\dth evident infrastipular spines, and with 

 stipules, petioles and pedmicles glandi,ilar." No such rose as this was 

 founcl^atjPecos. Rehder's account of R. fendleri (in Bailey's Cyclo- 

 pedia of American Horticulture) indicates a totall}^ different plant from 

 that indicated by Dr. Rydberg, much more in the manner of R. peco- 

 sensis. However, the sepals are said to be quite entire, and the flowers 

 normally in clusters. 



(4) E. gymnocarpa Xuttall. 



Easily separated from ours by the deciduous sepals. 



(5) E. neomexioana Ckll. 

 Fruits oblong; sec above. 



(6) E. aciculata (CkU.). 



Wet Momitain Valley, Colorado. Described as R. blanda var. 

 aciculata in Science Gossip, 1889, p. 188. Type at Kew; photographs 

 distributed to several herbaria. This has the flowers not very large, 

 bright pink; prickles straight, slender, pale; sepals entire, hispid; 

 stipules dilated, entire or slightly toothed at apex; leaflets 5 to 7, broad- 

 oval, simply 'serrate, pale beneath. There are no paired infrastipular 

 prickles. This appears to be allied to R. sayi, which occurs in the same 

 vicinity, but the leaves are very much smaller, and their marginal 

 teeth are normally simple. 



(7) E. sayi Schwein. 



I.ow, with large, thin, doubly-serrate leaflets; grows in moist places, 

 and occurs as far south as Beulah, New Mexico. Just how far the char- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



acters of this rose result directly from its surroundings is perhaps an 

 open question. If it could be transferred to a dry sunny place the 

 result might be something not very different from aciculata; but this 

 is mere guessing. The type locahty of sayi is somewhere near the 

 British boundary. 



(8) E. engelmanni S. Wats. 



Rehder gives this and sayi both as varieties of R. acicularis Lindley, 

 but this seems imi'easonable. I have found R. engelmanni abundantly 

 near the Halfway House on Pike's Peak, Colorado, and it seems very 

 distinct by its greatly elongated fruit. 



(9) R. pratincola Greene. 



The prairie species, formerlj^ confused with arkansana. It is only 

 one or two feet high, and has 7 to 11 leaflets. The stipules are only 

 softly pubescent. 



(10) R. suffulta Greene. 



A low form of open groimd, described from Las Vegas, New Mexico, 

 where I have collected it. I found it many years ago at Ula, Colorado, 

 and described it in MS. as a new variety of R. arkansana, but the de- 

 scription was not pubhshed. My specimen is at Kew. The flowers 

 are quite large, 66 mm. across, the petals pale, and often inclined to be 

 streaked. 



(11) R. manca Greene. 



W. Mancos Canon, S. Colorado, at 10,000 feet. Another of the small 

 species, about a foot high. The recurved prickles, small flowers, very 

 narrow stipules, etc., distinguish it. 



(12) R. macounii Greene. 



Assiniboia to Cheyenne, Wyoming. A low shrub of dry elevated 

 plains ; leaves wholly glandless, leaflets mostly 9 or 1 1 ; flowers solitary, 

 small and rather pale; fruits depressed-globose. 



(13) R. woodsii Lindley. 



A northern species, apparently not found in New Mexico. Accord- 

 ing to Watson, it is distinguished by the presence of infrastipular spines 

 and laterally lobed outer sepals, and is usually a low bush, not over 

 three feet high. Rydberg (Flora of Montana) states that the R. fendleri 

 of Watson and Coulter is the true R. woodsii, and remarks that the 

 character of lobed sepals is inconstant, and that in Lindley's original 

 description they are said to be entire. The fruit is small and red, and 

 the leaves are nearly glabrate, and according to E. Nelson shiny, 

 those of R. fendleri being dull. Rehder in his table says the sepals of 

 R. pisocarpa and fendleri are quite entire, while those of woodsii are 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



lobed; in this he doubtless merely follows Watson. He suggests, 

 however, that pisocarpa and fendleri may be varieties of woodsii. 

 Crepin, in 1896, dismissed looodsii as a doubtful species. Lindley, in 

 his first description, said the prickles were scattered, becoming paired 

 (imder the stipules) toward the extremities. In Bot. Reg., XII, PI. 976, 

 he figured them as quite regularly paired, both on the branches and 

 floriferous branchlets; the leaflets are represented as oboval and attenu- 

 ate at base, with simple teeth. It will be apparent from all this that 

 R. looodsii is not well understood, but it seems to be a low northern 

 form alhed to the R. neomexicana of New ^Mexico, and not to any of 

 the Pecos roses. 



There is in the Kew herbarium a rose labelled R. arkansana, from 

 ]kledicine Hat, June 1, 1894, John Macoun, 4,567. It has the leaflets in 

 sevens, pale, more or less cordate or trimcate, varying to more roimded, 

 sharply serrate ; flowers rather small, corymbose ; sepals reflexed after 

 flowering, without lateral lobes. This is certainly not R. macounii, nor 

 can it very well be the real arkansana; may it be the genuine woodsii ? 



(14) E. maximiliani Nees. 



A species of western Nebraska, differing from woodsii by its larger 

 yellow fruit and more pubescent leaves. 



(15) E. Wanda Alton.' 



A smooth, sHghtly prickly rose of Hudson's Bay and Newfoundland. 

 ^'arious Rocky Mountain plants have been confused mth it. 



(16) E. acicularis Lindley. 



An Arctic species of the Old World (Siberia and northern Europe), 

 said by Watson to occur in northern Alaska. It has oblong fruit; 

 leaves with five leaflets, mth simple teeth and not glandular beneath. 

 The Rocky Mountain representative- is R. engelmanni. 



(17) E. californica C. and S. 



This Californian rose is represented in the Rocky ^fountains b}^ var. 

 idtramontana Watson, which Crepin thought rather a variety of R. 

 pisocarpa. Dr. Rydberg, after seeing my description of R. pecosensis, 

 suggested that it might be "R. californica ultramontana. a good species 

 not closely related to R. californica, and growing in Utah, Wyoming 

 and Colorado." However, when this suggestion was made the fruit 

 of R. pecosensis had not been discovered. 

 (18) E. pisocarpa Gray. 



A species of Oregon, with oval leaflets, stipules and bracts entire, 

 small flowers and small globose fruits. Extends northward to British 

 Columbia. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 117 



(19) R. nutkana Presl. 



Alaska to Utah, but there is no evidence that it occurs as far south as 

 New Mexico. Rydberg says: "Recognized by its large flowers, stout 

 spines, doubly serrate firm leaves aod large fruit." This suggests 

 sayi, but the latter has thin leaves, and lacks the infrastipular spines 

 oi nutkana. 



(20) R. macdougali Hola. 



A species of the northern Rocky Mountains, distinguished from 

 nutkana by the densely bristly peduncles, and the infrastipular spines 

 much smaller, 



(21) R. melina Greene. 



A Colorado species confused with nutkana, but distinct by its small 

 glabrous foliage, short and hooked prickles, and sepals neither long- 

 attenuate nor glandular on the back. The fruit is very large, somewhat 

 obpyriform, nearly 1^ inches in diameter. Perhaps the Utah "nut- 

 kana" will also be found to belong here. 



There are still other species of Cinnamomese, but from their distri- 

 bution and characters they do not require consideration here. It is 

 hoped that the above summary will facilitate the identification of 

 Rocky Moimtain roses. 



Some New Mexico Roses. 



(1) Manzanares Valley, New Mexico (^lary Cooper). A rose with 

 large leaves, having the characters of R. sayi, but the serrations only 

 very shghtly compound. Inflorescence one-flowered, flowers bright 

 pink. A moderate number of prickles on flowering branch. The 

 lateral leaflets are about 30 mm. long and 20 broad. I refer this to 

 R. sayi, variety. 



(2) Santa Fe, New Mexico (Cockerefl) ; in herb. N. ^M. Agric. College. 

 Flowering stems with numerous slender straight prickles; stems not 

 dark; leaflets often in elevens, cuneiform with broadly rounded ends, 

 very slightly inclined to be doubly serrate, about 28 mm. long and 18 

 broad, color on both sides nearly the same ; sepals narrow, covered with 

 large knobbed gland-hairs; fruit red, rather large, obpjrriform, almost 

 globular; sepals persistent. This runs to R. arkansana in Cr^pin's 

 table; it is nearly the same as R. suffulta, differing by the very obtuse 

 leaflets and more glandular sepals. Can this be the genuine R. jendlerit 



(3) White Mountains, New ]\Iexico (Turner); in herb. N. M. Agric. 

 College. This was found labelled ^'fendleri," but it is very different 

 from the Santa Fe plant by its dark flowering stems, with few but 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Straight and strong ochreous spines; leaves pale beneath, leaflets 5 or 

 7; flowers bright pink, not large. This is R. neomexicana. 



In 1895 Prof. Wooton collected a rose on White Mountain, New 

 Mexico, with corymbose flowers and very long and narrow leaflets 

 having very long sharp teeth. The stem is dark, with rather numerous 

 light ochraceous shghtly curved prickles. This is much Hke an Illinois 

 specimen of R. hlanda, and requires further investigation.

THE ARACHNIDA OF FLORIDA. 



BY XATHAX BANKS. 



For about the past twelve 3'ears I have been receiving spiders from 

 Florida, and now have accumulated a larger number of species than 

 from any other State, except where collected for years by an arachnolo- 

 gist. From time to time I have published descriptions of the new 

 species, so that there are few new forms to record now. However, it 

 will be interesting to publish the entire list of Floridan spiders, as a 

 means of comparing the fauna with that of other portions of the United 

 States. 



The list is, of course, incomplete, 3'et it is doubtless a fair represen- 

 tation of the arachnid faima, since the materials have come from 

 widely separated parts of the State. Northwestern Florida is, however 

 not represented. Various ^Titers have questioned the propriety of 

 including subtropical Florida as a faunal part of the State. Similar 

 reasoning would throw out portions of man}- States ; therefore I accept 

 political boundaries. The collections upon which this list is based were 

 made by the following persons, at the places noted : 



Mrs. Annie T. Slosson: Punta Gorda, Palm Beach, Bisca^nie Bay, 

 Lake Worth. 



Mr. Philip Laurent: Miami, Jacksonville, Enterprise. 



Mr. A. Dobbin : Altoona. 



Prof. C. M. Weed: Citrus county. 



Nathan Banks: Rimnymede. 



Others: a number of Chernetidce have been taken by Mr. H. G. 

 Hubbard, and several others have sent me one or two species apiece. 



In this list are enumerated 211 spiders and 68 other arachnids, a 

 total of 279 species. The spiders are arranged in 21 families, 7 of them 

 being represented by but one species. The Epeiridae stands highest 

 in point of numbers, 45 species being included in it; the Theridiidse 

 follow with 44 species, and the Attidse with 38 species. The Lycosidce 

 have but 19 species and the Thomisidse the same. In many localities 

 these families equal or surpass the Attidse in number. The collection 

 is more brightly colored than one from the Northern States, and con- 

 tains many more bizarre forms. Of the arachnids other than spiders,

the mites have 35 species and the Pseudoscorpions 16 species; there 

 are 6 dadd3'--long-legs. 



The affinity of the fauna is with that of the general coast fauna of 

 the Southern States; the southern tip shows relation to the West 

 Indies. Few species are abundant in specimens, but tliere are many 

 genera represented. The Pseudoscorpions are more abundant than 

 anywhere else in oiu* country. All but about twentj^ species are in 

 the writer's collections; these few exceptions being chiefly species 

 recorded by Dr. Marx. 



Of noteworthy mention, one may refer to three species for the first 

 time recorded from our country: Theridium volatile Keys., previously 

 known from northern South America; Cupiennius sallei Keys., known 

 from ]\Iexico and Central America, and Wala grenada Peck., recorded 

 from several West Indian localities. Several other spiders which have 

 a tropical distribution have previously been recorded from southern 

 Florida. Characteristic ones are Wagnbria tauricornis, Epeira spini- 

 gera, E. undecimtuherculata, Leucauge argyra, Heteropoda venatoria and 

 Opisthacanthus elatus. The occurrence of a Gamasid mite of the cosmo- 

 tropical genus Megisthanus is also of much interest. Other rare and 

 curious forms are Gaviasomorpha floridana, Dictyna floridana, Kaira 

 alba and Phidippus pulcherimmus. Thirteen species are described as 

 new — eight spiders, three mites and two scorpions. 



In 1892-93 Dr. Einar I.onnberg visited Florida and made a small 

 collection of spiders, chiefl}^ from Orange county. Dr. Albert Tullgren 

 has reported on this collection, describing eleven species as new. The}^ 

 are as follows: 



Aysha orlandeiisis = Anyphcena gracilis Hentz. 



Lycosa angusta = Lycosa lenta Hentz. 



Lycosa albopuncta = Lycosa riparia Hentz. 



Lycosa (Pirata) loennbergi=Sosippus floridanus Simon. 



Lycosa {Pirata) transversolineata — unknown to me. 



Pardosa bilobata = Pardosa milvina Hentz. 



Pardosa longispinata — unknown to me. 



Oxyopes laminatus = Oxyopes scalaris Hentz. 



Phidippus clarconensis = Phidippus insolens Hentz. 



Phidippus oaklandensis = Phidippus cardinalis Hentz.

Centrurus hentzi n. sp. 



This is similar in most points to the preceding species, and may be 

 but a variety of it, yet as the color differences are so constant I give it 

 a separate name. The legs are marmorate \\ith blackish; on the 

 pedipalpi the tip of femui- is blackish, the apical half of the tibia is 

 marked ^^-ith black, and also the outer side of the hand. The tail is 

 marked with black below, leaving elongate pale spots, the basal joint 

 only slightly marked. The stripes on the dorsum are verj^ broad, leav- 

 ing only a narrow white line between them. There is no median pale 

 spot on anterior margin, which is seen in C. carolinianus.

Dark red-brown; cephalothorax strongly granulate in front; an 

 interrupted median ridge on the abdomen, and each segment with a 

 curved middle row of granules each side, and the posterior margin 

 granulate. Last segment of abdomen \nth the submedian ridges reach- 

 ing nearly to base, the side ridges not half so far; below with four 

 ridges, the side ones the longer. Tail with ten ridges on the first seg- 

 ment, eight on two, three and four ; fifth segment with a median ridge 

 beloW', as also on the last; a few lateral granules on these segments. 

 Sting long and curved, the tooth beneath acute, but short. Pedipalpi 

 long and slender; the femur subparallel, angular, with six ridges, a 

 median one on inner side; tibia with two submedian ridges on inner 

 side, a basal granule larger than others ;. tibia but slightly swollen. 

 Hand sw'ollen on base inside, not plainly angulate; the fingers longer

 must be xery similar to the type of Damosus, which is congeneric 

 with the type of Oribata. In place of the Oribata of authors I use 

 the next name, Galurnna. Notaspis, by the process of elimination, 

 rests upon that genus for which Oudemans has proposed the name 

 of Kochia. 1 deplore greatly the transference of the name Oribata, 

 but it is a perfectly plain case; and since several European authors

OBSEEVATIONS ON TITPAIA, WITH REFLECTIONS ON THE ORIGIN OF 

 PRIMATES. 



BY HENRY C. CHAPMAN, M.D. 



According to many anatomists, "the Twpaim possess a large 

 coecum."^ It appears worthy of mention, therefore, that on opening 

 recently the abdominal cavity of a specimen of Twpaia ferruginea 

 from Borneo not a trace of a coecum was to be seen (PI. IX, fig. 1), 

 confirming the statement recently made by the writer^ that the coecmii 

 was not invariably present in that Insectivore, nor was it present 

 in a recently examined specimen of T. pidum. It may be stated, 

 in a general way at least, that in mammals in which the stomach is 

 large the ccecmn is small, and vice versa. This inverse relation of 

 the stomach and ccecmn as regards size appears to be conditioned by 

 the fact that in cases where gastric action is hmited by the small size 

 of the stomach, the lack of digestion is made up by the digestive action 

 that goes on in the ccecum. It is not to be supposed, however, that 

 the cfEcum secretes a digestive juice like that of the stomach, but 

 rather that the proteid elements of the food and the acids developed 

 from the latter by fermentation act upon the residue of the food in 

 the coecum like the pepsin and hydrocliloric acids of the gastric juice. 



In cases, therefore, in which the stomach is large, as in that of the 

 Tupaia examined, it might be expected that the ccecum would be found 

 to be small, or even altogether absent. As a matter of fact, in the 

 specimen of Tupaia dissected the stomach was relatively large, meas- 

 uring in its long diameter 5 cent. (2 inches), the animal itself, from the 

 vertex to the root of the tail, measuring only 20 cent. (8 inches). 



The stomach was found distended to its utmost capacity, presenting 

 an almost globular form, and filled with what a]:)peared to be princi- 

 pall}'' the remains of vegetable food, though some remains of insects 

 were present. As gastric digestion appeared to be largely accom- 

 plished by the stomach in the case of the Tupaia examined, the 

 entire absence of a cacum becomes, after what has just been said, 

 intelligible. The intestine, measuring 71.2 cent. (28.5 inches), ex- 

 hibited throughout a luiiform diameter, and was loosely suspended 

 from the duodenum to the rectum by a continuous fold of peritoneum.

NATURAL SCIENX'ES OF PHILADELPHIA.

The liver was divided into four lobes, the gall bladder lying as if 

 in a hole in the cystic fissure.' The common bile duct passed into the 

 intestine .5 cent, (one-fifth of an inch) from the pylorus, that of the 

 pancreas about an ec^ual distance from the orifice of the bile duct. 



As Twpaia is usually regarded as being in its affinities the most 

 lemurine of the Insectivora, and Tarsius the most insectivorous 

 of the lemurs, the afimentary canal of Tarsius spectrum recently 

 dissected by the author (PI. IX, fig. 2) is submitted for comparison 

 with that of Twpaia. It will be observed that in Tarsius a distinct 

 coecum is present, though not large, and that the stomach is very 

 small. 



In previous communications made to the Academy, the author called 

 attention to the affinities of Chiromys and the Rodentia,* Galeopithecus 

 and the Chiroptera.^ If the structure of these animals has been cor- 

 rectly interpreted, and it be further admitted that Tarsius stands in 

 a similar relation to the Inse<;tivora, and Loris (Stenops) to the Simiae, 

 the phyliun of these various orders would be related to each other 

 somewhat as follows :

 the descendants of cretaceous or eocene lemurs could be transformed 

 into Platyrrhine monkeys hke those living at the present day, it is 

 readily seen, as suggested by Leidy,* "that but little change would be 

 necessary to evolve from the jaw and teeth of Notharctus that of a 

 modem monkey. The same condition which would lead to the sup- 

 pression of a first premolar in continuance would reduce the fangs of 

 the other premolars to a single one. This change \\dth a concomitant 

 shortening and increase of depth of the jaw, would give the character 

 of a Hving Cehus. A further reduction of a single premolar would give 

 rise to the condition of the jaw in the Old World apes and man." In 

 the union of the rami of the jaw at the symphysis, in the small size of 

 the condyle, in the number of the incisors, canines and true molars, 

 nearly ahke in their constitution and in their crowded condition, the 

 lower jaw of Notharctus resembles most strikingly that of a Platjorhine 

 monkey. Like Leidy, both Cope and Marsh regarded the Platyrrhine 

 monkeys, on the one hand as the descendants of extinct lemurs, and, 

 on the other, as the ancestors of the Catarrhinae. 



Thus Cope,' basing his \dew upon the structure of Tomitherium, 

 offered as a possible phylum the following: 



Homo 



Simiidse 



Cebus 



Hapale 



Lemur 



Tomitherium 



though later, as we shall see presently, he modified the above view^ 

 somewhat, finally regarding man and the anthropoids as having 

 probably descended directly from extinct lemurs Hke Anaptomorphus. 

 By similar reasoning from'the study of closely afl5Uated, if not identical, 

 Lemvu-oid genera: Limnotherium (Tomitherium), Antiacodon (Anapto- 

 morphus), Marsh,' in referring to the origin of the Primates, was 

 led to the conclusion that "we may justly claim America for the birth- 

 place of the order." 

 Why the Old World apes, when differentiated, did not come to the

land of their earlier ancestry is readily explained by the then inter- 

 vening oceans, which likewise were a barrier to the return of the horse 

 and rhinoceros, ^lan, however, came doubtless first across Behring's 

 Straits, and at his advent became part of our fauna as a mammal and 

 primate. 



As a confirmation of the view that the Platyrrhinse have descended 

 from monkeys, it may be mentioned that while the remains of Cehns, 

 Mycetes, Callethrix, and Hapale have been foimd, according to Ame- 

 ghino,^° in the Pleistocene strata of Brazil, extinct lemurs, such as 

 Notopithecidse and Homunculidse, have been discovered recently, 

 according to the same high authority, in the eocene deposits of South 

 America." Indeed, according to Ameghino," the Homunculidse are 

 to be regarded as the "ancetres de tons les singes du nouveau que de 

 I'ancien continent les lemurs excepte." Cope appears to have taken 

 the same view as that expressed by Ameghino. In speaking of certain 

 extinct forms of monkeys foimd in Patagonia, he remarks that the}'- 

 "appear to be ancestors of the existing South American monkeys 

 (Cebidae), and possibly of the Old V/orld m.onkeys also."^^ 



It should be mentioned, however, that these fossils are regarded 

 by some paleontologists as being rather the remains of Plat3Trhine 

 monkeys than lemiu-s. Should such prove hereafter to be the case, it 

 \vill not weaken the argument, since in that case the forms in question, 

 if not lemurs, would be intermediate in character between the latter 

 and Platyrrhine monkeys. The remains of Catarrhine monkeys, such 

 as Papeo, Macacus, Semnopithecus, and possibly even of the chimpan- 

 zee and orang, have been foimd in the Pliocene deposits of India." 



Such facts are, however, not inconsistent — indeed, have little or no 

 bearing upon the question of the derivation of Catarrhine from Platyr- 

 rhine monkeys — since the only assumption that would be necessary 

 would be to suppose that the Platyrrhine ancestors of the fossil Plio- 

 cene Catarrhines existed once in India or elsewhere. It may be said, 

 however, that this is assmning the very question at issue, a case of 

 petiiio principii; but the reverse proposition, that the Platyrrhine 

 have descended from the Catarrhine monkeys, is untenable, being incon- 

 sistent with the well-established fact that the more ancient members of 

 a group of animals had always more teeth than the later more recent

 with the exception of the Ardopitheca 32 teeth = 2-yYy|7|, and finally 

 the Catarrhinse, including the anthropoid apes and man, 32 teeth = 

 ^ • ^ • ^ • | . It is highly improbable, if not impossible, therefore, to say 

 the least, that Platyrrhine monkeys with 36 teeth should have descended 

 from Catarrhine ones provided with only 32; that 4 premolar teeth, 

 absent in the ancestors, once lost, shoLild reappear again in their de- 

 scendants — an objection that equally apphes to Cope's derivation of 

 Cehus with 36 teeth from Hapale with 32, as previously mentioned. 



Further, the Platyrrhine monkeys resemble lemurs in many more 

 respects than in the mere number of the teeth, thus showing their 

 inferior position in zoological rank as compared with the Catarrhines. 

 Thus, for example, the obhque ridge extending from the anterior in- 

 ternal cusp (protocone) to the posterior external cusp (metacone) of 

 the upper molars in Ateles and Mycetes, and many other South Ameri- 

 can monkeys, is present in certain lemurs, such as Nycticebus, Arcto- 

 cebus, Lor is, as also in anthropoid apes and man, though absent in the 

 remaining Catarrhines.^^ Now the presence of this obhque ridge in 

 the upper molars of lemurs, apes and man was regarded by so high an 

 authority as Cope as such an important feature in their structure that 

 it largely influenced that great paleontologist in suggesting the view, 

 already alluded to, that man and apes are the direct descendants of 

 lemurs rather than of Catarrhines. 



It is obvious, however, that if Cope's argimient is of any force in the 

 above instance, it must be of even greater cogency in shoAving that 

 Platyrrhine monkeys have descended from lemurs, since lemurs and 

 PlatyiThinffi not only exhibit the "oblique ridge" in their molars, but 

 possess many other structural features in common, whereas lemurs are 

 relatively so low in the zoological scale that they are not regarded by 

 most anatomists as being primates at all. Indeed, Cope might just 

 as well have argued that man has descended from a Platyrrhine monkey 

 as from a lemur, the evidence adduced being about as good for the one 

 view as the other; for even if the "centre of motion" of the vertebral 

 colunm and the " anticHnal vertebra," the number of vertebrse entering 

 into the formation of the sacrum, etc., are only the same in man, 

 anthropoids and Nycticebidce,^^ nevertheless in other respects — in fact,

in the totality of their organization — man and anthropoids resemble 

 the Catarrhine monkeys far more than lemurs. Had Cope, at the time 

 he described Anaptornorphus, been aware that the placenta of Tarsius, 

 a closely affiliated lemur, was discoid in form and highly complex in 

 structure rather than diffuse and non-deciduous, as in other lemurs, 

 his view of the lemuroid descent of man would have been strengthened 

 b}^ an argument of far more weight than one based upon the presence 

 of an oblique ridge on certain teeth and the number of sacral vertebrae, 

 which vary even in different individuals of the same or closely allied 

 species. Apart from the number of the teeth being the same in Platyr- 

 rhines and lemurs, the lemuroid character of dentition of the former is 

 clearty manifested by the long narrow inferior incisors of the South 

 American Said (Pithecea). 



Further, in all PlatjTrhine monkeys, as in most lemurs, the base of 

 the petrosal bone is excavated by that part of the lateral cerebral venous 

 sinus terminating at the postglenoid fossa. Similarly in both lemurs 

 and Platyrrhines the "malar bone is perforated by that branch of the 

 facial nerve known to the classical anatomist as the "nervus sub- 

 cutaneus malse." Again, in many Platyrrhines — as, for example, in 

 Cebus, Ateles, Nyctipilhecus — a small unossified vacuity is exhibited in 

 the bony plate separating the orbital from the temporal fossa, evidently 

 the relic of the space by which the two fossa freely communicate in 

 the lemurs. 



In all the South American monke3'S the tympanic bone retains more 

 or less its primitive ring-like form, the cavity of the tympanum lying 

 close to the external wall of the cranium, its inferior surface, together 

 with that of the anchylosed penotic bone, exhibiting a very swollen 

 appearance. In this respect the Platyrrhine monkeys agree with the 

 lemm-s, in which the inferior surface of the tympanum ])resents a large 

 rounded bulla, and differ from all Old World monkeys, in none of which 

 an auditory bulla is ever present. The otosteals of the Platyrrhines 

 resemble those of lemurs more than those of Catarrhines, monkeys, 

 apes or man. 



It is an interesting fact, also, that while the macula lutea is present 

 in the eye of man, apes and Catarrhines, it has never been found, so 

 far as known to the writer, in any PlatjTrhine or lemur. 



As reference has been made to the character of the vertebrse in man 

 and Nycticebidse, it may be as well mentioned in this connection tliat 

 in the lemur Galago the posterior edges of the spinous processes of the 

 lumbar vertebrae present a pair of processes which, projecting back- 

 ward, clasp the anterior edges of the succeeding spinous process, and 




15i PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan.. 



that similar processes, though not so well developed as in Galago, are 

 present in certain species of South American monkeys, as, for example, 

 in Lagothrix and Mycetes. The presence of these processes is quite 

 as strong a proof that Platyrrhines have descended from lemm-s as 

 are the peculiarities in the vertebral column already referred to that 

 man has descended directly from a lemur. It is well knowTi that 

 while the supracondjdar perforation of the humerus is not found in 

 any Old World monkey, nor in Hapale, Ateles or Mycetes among those 

 of the Xew World, nevertheless such perforation is foimd in the Cebidse 

 and most of the lemurs. It would be tedious to show in further 

 detail that, as regards the muscular system, the character of the brain, 

 the larynx, the alimentary canal, and in many other respects, the 

 Platyrrhine monkeys are less specialized than the Catarrhines, which 

 has induced the majority of anatomists to regard the New World 

 monkeys as of higher rank zoologically than the lemurs, but lower in 

 the scale of life than the Catarrliines, occup3dng an intermediate posi- 

 tion between the two. This is consistent with the -sdew that they 

 are the descendants of the one and the ancestors of the other. 



This conclusion has been confirmed in late years by the remarkable 

 researches of Selenka," Strahl,-^ and others, who have sho^vn, in a 

 general way at least, that the transitory stages through which the 

 placenta of man and anthropoids pass are permanently retained as 

 the placenta of certain marsupials, lemurs, Tarsius, Platyrrhines, 

 Catarrhines, illustrating the law that in the development of the 

 placenta the ontogeny is as elsewhere the epitome of the phylogeny. 



Thus while in marsupials like Macropus the allantois remains free, 

 as first sho^\^l by Owen,^" and nearly fifty years after^vard by thewTiter,^ 

 in Perameles and Dasyurus the allantois, it is said, adheres to the 

 mucous wall of the uterus, forming at least the beginning of a placenta, 

 without, however, a decidua or chorionic villous process being devel- 

 oped. In lemm-s, while no decidua is as yet developed, the chorion 

 exhibits villous processes which insinuate themselves into the mucous 

 wall of the uterus. In Tarsius, however, the allantois begins to form a 

 true disk-hke placenta with a veritable decidua — "nicht eine lockere 

 gross zottige diffuse Placentation wie Lemur und Nycticebus sondern 

 eine hoch komplicirte und diskoide Placenta besitzt."^^

The placenta of the Xew World monkeys exhibit a step further in 

 advance the difference from the placenta of Tarsiiis, being however, 

 one of degree raiher than of kind. 



In the Old World monkeys the allantois forms a double placenta, a 

 primary large dorsal one and a secondary small ventral one (Plate X). 

 While this appears to be normally the case, it should be mentioned 

 that the T\Titer observed but one placenta in the case of a pregnant 

 female of Macacus cynomolgus examined by him, though the preg- 

 nancy was far advanced in both instances.^^ It will be observed that 

 in the case of the Macacus (Plate X), the two placentas are not 

 entirely separated as is usually the case in Catarrhines, being joined 

 by a small body of tissue. 



It is also a significant fact that wliile two umbihcal veins and two 

 umbihcal arteries are always present in the umbihcal cord of the Xew 

 World monkeys, but one lunbihcal vein is present in that of the Old 

 World ones. Finally, the placenta of the anthropoids agrees essentially 

 with that of man. 



In the opinion of the writer, therefore, the phylum submitted at 

 p. 149, essentially that of Haeckel,^^ expresses about the truth as to 

 the descent of man, etc., so far as can be learned at present from the 

 facts of palseontolog}^, comparative anatomy and embryology, that 

 bear upon the question. That the ancient Prosimiae, Hyopsodinse, 

 Adapidse, etc., have descended from some imgulate type of life is 

 manifested by their affinities with the latter group of mammals. 

 Indeed, Cuvier described ^c^apis as "un autre genre de pachyderme 

 — et que je nommerai provisoirement Adapis,"^* while, according to 

 Leidy, Notharctus tenebrosus was "a small extinct pachyderm, re- 

 sembling that of some of the existing American monkeys quite as much 

 as it does that of any of the living pachyderms. "^5 



It is quite possible that future researches may show that there is 

 no genetic connection between Chiromys and the Rodentia, but that 

 the rodent-like teeth of the former and of the wombat may have been 

 acquired independently by a process of natural selection, it being easy 

 to see, according to Tomes,^* "how a rodent type of dentition is bene- 

 ficial to its possessor by rendering accessible articles of food wholly 

 unavailable for creatures which have no means of gnawing through' a

shell or other hard body," the theory being, according to Darwin, 

 that a small variation arising in the dentition through some nutritive 

 change, and being of advantage in the struggle for life, would be 

 intensified in successive generations imtil, in the end, a type of tooth 

 would be evolved such as is presented in the case of the wombat, 

 Chiromys, and Rodentia Hv-ing in far distant parts of the world. 



Finally, in the judgment of the writer, man cannot have descended 

 from either the gorilla, chimpanzee, the orang or gibbon, since, apart 

 from the structural difference between any one of them and man being 

 too great to warrant such an hypothesis, the three great anthropoid 

 apes are obviously degenerates leading to no higher form of life, but 

 rapidly djdng out, as sho's\Ti by the fact that these apes resemble man 

 much more when veny yoiuig than when adult. While it is true that 

 the gap between man and the gibbon is greater than between man 

 and the remaining apes, nevertheless, as Pithecanthropus erectus, 

 whatever its real nature may be, is something more than a gibbon, and 

 yet something less than a man — more ape-like than any man, and more 

 man-like than any ape ^^ — by a method of exclusion the conclusion is 

 reached that the man and gibbon are related in some way. 



It must be admitted, nevertheless, that the question of the exact 

 origin of man is largely as yet one of speculation, and that future re- 

 searches may show that our ancestors may have been extinct Catar- 

 rhine or Plat\Trhine monkeys or even lemurs.

SABELLID^ AND SERPULID^ FROM JAPAN, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW 

 SPECIES OF SPIRORBIS. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE and KATHARINE J. BUSCH. 



In these Proceedings for 1903 was published a paper describing 

 most of the Polychaeta taken in Japanese waters and elsewhere in the 

 Xorth Pacific in the spring of 1900 by the U. S. F. C. steamer Albatross. 

 The present paper is a continuation of that contribution, and is based 

 on the same collections. A third part will some time deal with a num- 

 ber of species belonging to various families, the descriptions of which 

 are withheld until some desirable comparisons can be made. Among 

 the species previously described a considerable admixture of circum- 

 boreal forms was foimd, most of them from the more northern stations. 

 That none such is found among the Sabellidae and Serpulidse probabl}'- 

 results from the fact that all of the species described in this paper came 

 from the southeastern coast of Honshu, and especially from Station 

 3,707, on a sandy and gravelly bottom in Suruga Bay. Saint-Joseph's 

 revision of these families was largely used as a guide in the generic 

 references, but even with this help much difficulty was found in satis- 

 factorily placing several of the species, and it will be noticed that some 

 of them, and particularly Sabella japonica and Pomatoceras aurituhis, 

 depart widely from the generic types in some respects. In the enu- 

 meration of segments the collar setae have been counted as belonging 

 to the first of peristomial somite. 



I take this opportunity to state that Maldane coronata and Axiothea 

 campanulata of my former paper are synonyms respectively of M. 

 gotoi and Clymene harai Izuka. Although Izuka's paper was pub- 

 lished some months before mine it was not seen by me until after 

 the correction of the final proofs. 

 Sabella japonica n. sp. (PI. XI, figs. 1, 2; PI. XII, figs. 39, 40.) 



Without the branchia) the type specimen has a length of 25 mm., 

 of which the thorax takes 5 mm., and is 2.5 mm. in diameter: the de- 

 tached branchite are 7.5 mm. long. A second specimen without bran- 

 chiiE is 23 mm. long. As the branchifje are detached some doubt 

 attaches to them. They are much twisted, with 15 pairs of rather 

 short, thick radioles .slightly coiled inward at the ends; the barbs are 




158 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



double-ranked, very close together, and have a nearh^ uniform length 

 of 1.3 mm. to the end of the radioles. Xo eyes are visible. The second 

 radiole from the dorsum of the right side terminates in a membranous 

 vesicle which is probably pathological, but which would act much like 

 the operculum of A-pomahis. The branchial lobes are shghtly involute 

 ventrall^^ The collar is stiff and erect, separated by the entire wddth 

 of the bodj^ dorsally, but prolonged ventrally as a pair of abrupt promi- 

 nent narrow lobes in contact at the base. Except for very slight 

 lateral emarginations the margin is entire. The thoracic region is 

 nearly terete, the abdominal somewhat depressed and of a miiform 

 \\-idth except at the tapering caudal end. There are 8 setigerous 

 thoracic and 55 or 56 abdominal somites, mostly distinctly marked 

 and uniannulate. Thick and very distinct ventral plates occupy the 

 neural third of the body. Those of the thorax are twice as vade as 

 long and undi^dded, except the first, or peristomial one, which is as ^nde 

 as long and of a sugar-loaf shaped outhne. The first abdominal plate 

 is pentagonal, the others are divided into two equal squares by the 

 fiecal groove which is very distinct ventrally, but, after turning to the 

 right in the furrow '^z^, and bending forward on IX, disappears totally 

 on the side of the latter below the setfe. There is no trace of the dorsal 

 groove. The setigerous and uncinigerous tori are strictty lateral and 

 not elevated above the general surface of the body; the latter diminish 

 in size caudall3^ The body ca\dty is filled with rather large eggs. 



All of the setae (PI. XI, fig. 1) are of the -winged capillary tj-pe, but 

 differ considerabty in length, slenderness and width of the wing. They 

 are very- nearly straight, very acute, and, although obliquely striated, the 

 wings have entire margins. Both a\dcular and pick-shaped uncini 

 occur on the thoracic, the former only on abdominal somites. Their 

 nmnber is alwaj-s small— e.^., 27 of each on III, 21 on \1, and 20 on 

 VHI, wliile never more than 18 of the aviculse only occur on abdominal 

 somites. In both regions they rapidly dimmish in size from the end 

 of the tori nearest to the setae, the smallest in the abdominal tori 

 not exceeding ^ the size of the largest. In the thoracic region the 

 same statement appHes to the pick-shaped hooks. The thoracic 

 a\dcular uncini (fig. 39) have elongated bodies, about equalling the 

 elevated neck and head, the posterior process slender and produced, 

 and the breast small, but abrupt and strongly convex. The neck 

 meets the body nearly at a right angle, is high and erect, and curves 

 broadly and regularly into the stout tapering beak without any dis- 

 tinct enlargement into head or crest. The crest is represented by a 

 fine striation near the vertex without any elevation or free teeth. The 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



sinus is very open with nearly straight parallel sides. On the abdomi- 

 nal somites these iincini (fig. 40) differ in the much reduced posterior 

 process, the deeper, more sloping breast and the more wedge-shaped 

 sinus. The figure is, however, somewhat foreshortened. The smaller 

 imcini (fig. 2) have a pecuHar form, which is transitional between the 

 avicular and the usual pick-shaped uncini. The slender stem or body 

 is bent strongly and slightly tWckened, but lacks a distinct breast. 

 The head is slightly enlarged with a very short, stout, shghtly de- 

 curved beak and a prominent cap-hke crest, much subdivided; from 

 the base of the beak projects a slender angulated filament. In the 

 form of the small uncini this species departs widely from the typical 

 Sabellm. 



Sm'uga Bay, 3,707, 63-75 fms. Type and one other. 

 Potamilla acuminata n. sp. (PI. XI, figs. 3-6; PI. XII. fig. 41.) 



Tliis species is elongated and slender, a complete example having a 

 total length of 50 mm., of which the branchise are 20 mm. and the 

 thorax 5 mm., the diameter being 1.9 mm. 



The branchise are more than ^ of the total length, and when retracted 

 into the tube are not at all or very slightly t-wdsted and coiled. Two 

 specimens have 19 radicles on the right, 17 on the left, the other having 

 15 and 16 respectively. The}^ are straight, slender, of nearly imiform 

 diameter, without eye-spots, and bear barbs nearly or quite to the tips 

 in the dorsalmost radioles, ])ut have a free end devoid of barbs and of 

 considerable length in the ventral ones. Most of the radioles are pro- 

 vided with a short membranous wing on the inner side of the base, but 

 there is no trace of a connecting web. The barbs have the usual 

 biserial arrangement and equal or exceed the diameter of the body, 

 with little diminution toward the distal end. The bases are entirely 

 simple. 



The collar is scarcely evident dorsally, but becomes prominent 

 opposite to the dorsal setae line, just below which is a barely distinguish- 

 able fold. On each side of the median ventral line is a l:)roadly roimded, 

 flat, somewhat thickened process, about as long as the first somite. 

 In the retracted specimens these overlap medially. The entire ventral 

 portion of the collar, except the ventral lobes, is extremely thin and 

 delicate. 



Between the bases of the branchiffi is a small roimded prostomial 

 lobe, from which a broad folded meml^rane extends laterally around 

 the mouth and joins tlie bases of the branchise. Connected with the 

 inner side of the latter also are the so-called tentacles, consisting of a 

 pair of processes about twice as long as the second somite, with the 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



leaf-like basal part folded longitudinally to form a groove, and the 

 terminal ^ attenuated . 



The complete specimen has S setigerous thoracic and 68 abdominal 

 somites. The body is nearl}^ terete throughout and has a nearly uni- 

 form diameter, except at the posterior end. Anteriorly the parapodia 

 are not at all elevated, but become rather prominent posteriorly. 

 Except the peristomeum all somites have sharply defined ventral 

 plates. In one specimen all, and in the others all but the first 8, are 

 divided into 2 equal squares by a ventral groove. The pygidium has 

 the form of a slightly oblique we It -like fold, which boimds the an vis 

 dorsally and laterally. The fsecal groove is well-marked ventrally from 

 the anus to the somite IX, on which it passes caudad of the ventral plate 

 to the right and then bends sharply forward and passes obliquely 

 anterior to the seta bimdle to the dorsum, where it disappears. 



All of the setse and uncini are of a pale glistening yellow color and 

 have the arrangement usual in the genus. The seta^ of II are all of 

 the winged capillary type, but differ in length, width of wing and degree 

 of curvatm-e or bending. The more slender and regularly curved ones 

 are dorsal. The 7 succeeding thoracic somites bear both capillary in 

 the dorsal and paddle-shaped setse in the ventral part of the bimdles. 

 The former (fig. 3) have the characters just described, but the more 

 ventral ones exhibit transitions toward the broad form in the tendency 

 of the wing to wdden and split into two divergent symmetrical plates. 

 The two kinds are, however, always distinct. The paddle-shaped 

 setae (fig. 5) are arranged in a short, close phalanx. They have rela- 

 tively stout, slightly tapering, striated stems, with the short, broad 

 wings together forming a thin ovate expansion wdiich tapers distally 

 into a mucronate tip, whose length equals the greatest width of the 

 blade and which is bent out of the plane of the latter. On the abdomi- 

 nal somites only capillary setae (fig. 4) again occur, and in gradually 

 diminishing number. The more slender, elongated, nearly wingless 

 ones are usuall}^ paired with shorter broader ones. 



On the thoracic segments the uncinigerous tori are flush with the 

 surface of the body and bear the two kinds of uncini in parallel vertical 

 rows, the avicula? being anterior. On somite III there are 44 of each, 

 on VI 32, and a further reduced number on VIII. The avicular uncini 

 (fig. 41) have the slender posterior process and the erect portion equal 

 and meeting at a right angle; the breast nearly hemispherical; the 

 neck erect and straight; the beak moderately long, acute and straight, 

 and inclined sharply downward with the lower margin j)arallel to the 

 breast; the crest elevated and much subdivided, with about 5 distinct

teeth along the profile. The pick-shaped nncini (fig. 6) are more char- 

 acteristic. They have slender, slightly curved stems, slightly in creasing 

 in diameter toward the distal end, and exceed the total length of the 

 avicular uncini. The head is small, with a rounded back, and a short 

 blunt beak, enclosed in a dehcate and transparent hood, the base of 

 which is often inflated, and the distal part prolonged at right angles 

 to the stem into an exceedingly delicate and attenuated process, which, 

 though A-arying considerably in length, always much exceeds the length 

 of the head of the avicular uncini. The latter only occur on the ab- 

 domidal somites, where they form short vertical series of from 12 to 18. 

 Except that the upper outline of the breast is more sloping, they have 

 exactly the form of the thoracic ones. 



In the form of its setse this species closely resembles Sahella (Pota- 

 mUlal) assimilis Mcintosh, but the pick-shaped uncini of that species 

 have not been described. It was dredged by the Challenger in 600 

 fathoms off Buenos Ayres. It also agrees fairly well with the Pota- 

 milla torelli of Marenzeller and liangerhans, but not with Malmgren's 

 original description . 



The tube is circular and tortuous, of a tough cartilaginous consistency, 

 covered evenly with A^ery fine sand and has a clear line, evidently of 

 attachment, along one side. 



Sagami Bay, 3,698, 153 fms., 2 specimens and fragments of a third, 

 with tubes. 



Hypsicomus lyra n. sp. (PI. XI, figs. 7-13; PI. XII, fig. 42.) 



The type is very long and slender, having a total length of 84 mm., 

 the thorax 6 mm. and the gills 20 mm.; the diameter is 1.6 mm. 



As seems to be usual in the genus, the basal lobes of the gills are 

 quite prominent, about equalhng the length of the first 3 somites, 

 and their somewhat membranous dorsal and ventral margins overlap 

 in the middle line. The distal end is strictly transverse and even, so 

 that the radioles all arise from the same level. The radioles are long, 

 slender, straight, not winged, and united by a web for the basal -J. 

 The double-ranked barbs are very numerous, slender and long, their 

 length about equalhng the diameter of the body, but diminishing some- 

 what before the short, naked tip of the radiole is reached. A con- 

 spicuous zone of reddish-brown eye-spots occupies about the third ■j\ 

 of the branchiae, though they exhibit much irregularity in arrangement, 

 and seldom occupy this entire distance on individual radioles. Each 

 radiole bears a series on each outer margin, but the number varies from 

 5 to 20 or more, and they may be widely separated, jnuch crowded or, 

 11 




162 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



even coalesced. They also vary much in size, and the two series on a 

 radiole are seldom syimnetrical. 



The collar is simple, cleft, but in contact and slightly inturned dorso- 

 medially. The dorsal half is low, of an even height, and has a shghtly 

 wavy margin. The ventral half rises very gradually to the apex of 

 the triangular lobes which nearly meet in the middle line Ijut diverge 

 distally. There are no lateral incisions. 



A pair of prominent tentacles are united with the middle of the inner 

 face of the imdivided base of the palpi. They rise freely to a length 

 exceeding that base, and consist of a foliaceous proximal ^, and a nar- 

 row ligulate distal |. Besides these a pair of minute processes occur 

 side by side on the middle of the head disk, and probably represent the 

 true prostomial tentacles. 



The 174 to 184 somites, of which 8 are thoracic, form a slender, elon- 

 gated body, terete anteriorly, but very strongly arched above and with 

 a sole-like ridge formed by the ventral plates in the posterior part. 

 The lozenge-shaped anus is situated in a small pj^gidium. In the 

 thoracic region the segments are longer and distinct ; in the abdominal 

 they are very short and posteriorly much crowded. Here the body 

 walls are very thin and distended by the well-filled intestine. The 

 ventral plates of the thoracic region are not elevated above the general 

 surface, but occupy the entire area between the tori. Thej^ are sepa- 

 rated from each other by deep transverse grooves, and the fii'st from 

 the peristomial collar by a deep browoi or black, apparently chitinous 

 line. The fii'st is about 4 times as broad as long, the second 3 times, 

 and the others not over 1^ times. The first abdominal plate is about f 

 as long as the last thoracic, the second is polygonal, and the others 

 become successively shorter to the caudal end and form a deeply 

 pigmented, narrow, sole-like ridge, di^dded from the anterior margin 

 of the third one to the anus by the faecal groove. The fa?cal groove 

 divides the ventral plates continuously to the posterior margin of 

 somite X, around which and IX it passes obliquely to the right, and 

 then along the middle of the dorsum of the thoracic segments, on which, 

 however, it is very faint. 



Dense tufts of seise occupy the dorsal portion of the setigerous tori 

 on II to VIII inclusive, and smaller tufts of very prominent setae pro- 

 ject from the ventral side of those of all abdominal somites. On 

 somite I are two setigerous lines shaped like the sides of a l\Te, which 

 begin with a just perceptible curve slightly dorsad of the succeeding 

 tuft of setae, and diverge obhquely forward in a nearly straight hne to 

 the base of the collar, on which they extend as an inturned loop of 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



very minute setae. The thoracic imcinigerous tori are strictly vertical, 

 and ventral to the setse, and occupy an area on each side about equal 

 to the ventral plates. The abdominal tori are dorsal to the setsE and 

 quite short. 



On somite I the collar setse are arranged in a double series along each 

 line. Those of the dorsalmost series (fig. 8) are stouter, nearly straight, 

 and are terminated by an elongated conical hood or sheath more or 

 less inflated at the base, and usually bent or wavy in the slender distal 

 half. They are evidently intermediate in structiure between the pick- 

 shaped imcini and hmbate setse. Those of the ventralmost series (fig. 

 7) are more slender, sharpty curved at the end, and provided on the 

 convex side T\-ith a short but broad obhquely striated wing. The re- 

 maining thoracic somites contain curved hmbate setse in the dorsal 

 part of the fascicles and paddle-shaped spatulate setse ventrally. The 

 former (fig. 9) present no noteworthy features. The latter are arranged 

 in close double file, those of the cephalic file (fig. 10) being stouter with 

 very broad, truncate, usually more or less asymmetrical blades; those 

 of caudal (fig. 11) row have nearly circular blades, which usually bear 

 a smooth-edged mucronate tip as long as or shghtly longer than the 

 blade. In the abdominal fascicles are 2 or 3 slender, nearly or quite 

 wingless capillary setse, and a small number of paddle-shaped setse (fig. 

 12), with smaU ovoid blades and a' prominent, stout, fringed terminal 

 process 2 or 3 times as long. 



There are about 60 of each kind of uncini in the thoracic row^s begin- 

 ning with II. The avicular form (fig. 42) has the base straight, much 

 prolonged posteriorly, and with a small rounded breast. From the 

 base the short, somewhat tapering neck inclines forward at an angle of 

 about 120°. There is no enlarged head, but the vertex is high, promi- 

 nent and narrow, with the rather short, straight conical beak bent 

 down at a sharp angle. The crest is scarcely differentiated, the front 

 of the vertex being only faintly striated and not at all subdivided. 

 Pick-shaped uncini (fig. 13) are w^ell differentiated and regularly paired 

 mth the larger ones. They have straight, column-hke stems, and 

 hollow sheath-like heads (sometimes slightly inflated), running 

 into slender, tapering processes nearly at right angles to the stem. 

 The abdominal uncini are fewer, smaller, and have longer necks than 

 the thoracic avicular uncini, but are otherwise quite similar. 



The tube is slightly sinuous, nearly round in section and about 

 2.3 ram. in diameter. It has a peculiar tough horny textm-e, is thin- 

 walled and deep brown or almost black. 



From H. phceatcenia (Schmarda) ^Nlarenzeller this species differs 




164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



especially in the presence of mucronate palese in the thoracic tori and 

 in the greater number of setae and palese in the abdominal somites, as 

 well as in the form of the palese and pick-shaped micini and the arrange- 

 ment of the eyes. 



Snruga Bay, 3,707, 63-75 fms., 4 specimens, ^^-ith tubes. 



Dasychone japonica Mcintosh. 



The specimens have a length of 40 mm., the branchise being 13. 

 There are 8 setigerous thoracic and 76 abdominal somites and 28 to 30 

 branchial plumes. With the exception of occasional variations having 

 a second small accessory tooth, the uncini are exactly as figured by 

 ]\IcIntosh. The tentacles are lanceolate, ^ the length of the branchise 

 and thickly spotted with reddish-brown. Two specimens, one in a 

 membranous tube to which various foreign bodies are attached, from 

 an imknoAvn station. 



The first dorsal appendage of each branchial radiole is fully tmce as 

 long as and much thicker than any of the others, and is single, and not 

 paired, as the others are. The collar begins dorsally as a prominent lobe, 

 which includes the first fascicle of setse; ventrally it is thickened and 

 the ventral lobes overlap medially for nearly their entire width. 

 There are no lateral incisions. 



Laonome tridentata n. sp. (PI. XII, fig. 44.) 



The type and only specimen is 44 mm. long ^\dthout branchise, 

 which are 9 mm. in length; the thorax is 7 mm. long and 4 mm. 

 diameter. 



The detached branchise found in the same bottle are not known 

 with absolute certainty to belong to this species. The basal part of 

 each palp forms an undivided plate about tmce the length of the peris- 

 tomium and of a scroll-hke form with a shghtly spiral roll. Each 

 bears 15 rather thick short radicles not exceeding twice the diameter of 

 the thorax. The longest barbs or filaments at the base have a length 

 equalhng about I of the body diameter, and they diminish toward the 

 end, where the radiole terminates in a slender naked filament longer 

 than the longest barbs. There are no eyes. 



The peristomial collar is about as long as the second somite, slightly 

 more produced on the ventral side and consequently somewhat oblique. 

 It is deeply cleft in the middle line dorsally and slightly so ventrally, 

 but without lateral incisions. It is thick and stiff, -u-ith the margin 

 entire and slightly produced, but not lobed ventrally. 



There are 8 setigerous thoracic and 62 abdominal somites. The 

 body is shghtl}^ flattened, with a nearly uniform width, tapering some- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



what toward the posterior end, where it terminates in a sHghtly obhque 

 pygidiiim with a somewhat ventral anus. The peristomimn and the 

 base of the collar are dusky with numerous minute spots, which con- 

 tinue also on to the sides of several of the succeeding somites. No 

 distinct ventral plates are developed, but the entire body wall appears 

 to be somewhat glandularly thickened. Throughout the abdoimnal 

 region the faecal groove is very narrow but distinct. Reaching the 

 ventral middle line of IX it bends to the right and passes obliquely 

 across that segment to the level of the seta, then in the furrow VIII / IX 

 for a short distance, and obliquely across the dorsum of VIII to its 

 anterior border at the dorsal middle line, from which point it continues 

 forward, becoming very deep on II and I, and finally disappears in 

 the dorsal collar cleft. 



The thoracic setigerous tubercles are quite prominent and the unci- 

 nigerous tori very long, the most anterior ones nearly meeting ventrally 

 and the posterior not much shorter. The abdominal tori are about ^ 

 as long as the anterior thoracic. 



The setae occur in strong tufts, but all are broken short off at the 

 body surface. A few fragments of the terminal parts indicate that 

 they are short and stout, with broad blades distinctly denticulated 

 on the margins. Both thoracic and abdominal somites bear rather 

 large uncini, all of one kind and arranged in a single series. A torus 

 on somite V contains 112, all of one size; on the abdominal somites 

 they are about f as large, and 41 were comited on somite XL 



They have the form (fig. 44) represented by Malmgren for the type 

 of the genus and quite unlike that figm-ed by Marenzeller for his 

 Laonome japonica. The base is abruptly truncated posteriorly, nearly 

 continuing the direction of the posterior line of the neck, but is pro- 

 duced anteriorly into a remarkably prominent breast that reaches 

 beyond the tip of the beak. A short, thick, erect neck is surmounted 

 by a scarcely enlarged head with a prominent, acute, slightly recurved 

 beak nearly parallel with the opposite border of the breast, from which 

 it is separated by a sinus much narrower than the diameter of the neck; 

 the elevated crest is composed of 3 or rarely of 4 very distinct, acute, 

 solid teeth of diminishing size. 



Suruga Bay, 3,707, type only, without tube. 

 Euchone alicaudata n. sp. (PI. XI, figs. 14-16; PI. XII, fig. 43.) 



The single example was taken from a tube and is regularly rounded 

 and of equal diameter, with the somites very indistinctly indicated, ex- 

 cept at the caudal end, where the body is flattened and tapers abruptly. 

 The total length is 38 mm., the thorax 6.5 mm., and the brancliia 13 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



mm. There are eight setigerous thoracic and twenty-five abdominal 

 somites. The thoracic and most of the abdominal somites are ob- 

 scm-ely equally biannulate. Ventral plates are confined to the thoracic 

 segments and are divided into two equal parts by the transverse inter- 

 annular furrows. The last eight abdominal somites are more distinctly 

 differentiated, and decrease rapidly in diameter to the short rounded 

 pygidium. From them the broad caudal membrane arises just ventrad 

 of the setse, continuing anteriorly around the ventral surface nearly to 

 the middle line, but posteriorly spreading widely as a horizontal plate 

 with a median emargination in which the pygidiiun lies. The basal 

 part of the membrane exhibits distinct metameric thickenings which 

 disappear toward the margins. 



The anus is situated slightly ventrad in a small sht, from which the 

 very faint faecal groove passes forward between the ventral cleft of 

 the caudal membrane to the posterior margin of somite IX, where 

 it turns to the left, passes obliquely across the side of this somite and 

 disappears in front of the setigerous area, but reappears in the dorsal 

 middle line of YIII and continues to the peristomium, where it turns 

 slightly to the left and disappears finally on the collar. 



The collar is ver}^ peculiar. It is thin and rather high, its margin 

 even all around, but, owing to the obliquity of the peristomium due 

 to the prolongation forward of its ventral plate, the height of the collar 

 appears to be about twice as great dorsally as ventrally. The median 

 ventral part is injured so that the character of the ventral lobes cannot 

 be ascertained. Laterally at the level of the sides of the ventral plates 

 is an abrupt thinning, folded in the form of a little niche terminating 

 at the base in a minute pit ; but there is no actual incision. Dorsally 

 a somewhat similar condition exists, each half of the collar being ad- 

 herent to the median line by a very delicate membranous fold, so that 

 no actual cleft is present, The fold of the right side overlaps the left 

 broadly, and thus deflects the end of the faecal groove toward the 

 latter side. Xo eyes nor otocysts are visible on either the peristomium 

 or pygidiimi. 



As indicated by the measurements the branchiae are relatively 

 elongated, contributing about ^ of the total length. The basal lobes 

 are exceedingly short and are entirely concealed within the collar. 

 There are 15 branchial radioles on each side, arranged strictly in one 

 row and of equal length. They show no tendency to coil or twdst. 

 The radioles of each half are connected for ^ of their length by a delicate 

 membrane, to which they stand in the relation of the ribs to the cover 

 of an umbrella, and which is continued as a delicate wing, especially 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



wide on the most dorsal and ventral member of each group, along each 

 radiole and expands at their ends into a leaf-like appendage, through 

 wliich the naked end of the radiole passes like a mid-rib, and beyond 

 which it forms a short mucronate tip. The filaments present the usual 

 paired arrangement and are numerous and exceedingly long, the length 

 of the basal ones being at least 1^ times the diameter of the thoracic 

 segments. Besides the ordinary filaments a nmnber of very much 

 larger ones occur within the radicles, one apparently being attached 

 to the base of each of several of the latter. Though none is perfect, 

 they often equal ^ of the length of the radioles. As they bear slight 

 ■\nngs and have distinct cartilaginous axes, they probably represent 

 a second set of naked radioles. The region is so brittle that a thorough 

 study of the specimen is impossible. The tentacles are apparenth- 

 short ovate-lanceolate in shape. Very small eggs completely fill the 

 body cavity. 



The setse of the first thoracic fascicle and the abdominal somites arc 

 apparently all slender, wdnged capillary, those on the latter with 

 extremely narrow wings. On the other thoracic somites there are 

 two forms, distinguished by the breadth of the wings and not always 

 to be sharply separated. Those in a dorsal group (fig. 14) have slender, 

 longitudinally striated shafts, more or less bent and dra^\^l out to a very 

 fine tip, the winged margin fringed, confined to one side, of varying 

 width and reaching far out toward the end of the shaft. Those of a 

 ventral group (fig. 15) are shorter, stouter, with short, broad, usually 

 asymmetrical, obliquely striated double wings and an acuminate tip. 

 The internal structure is similar to the mere slender setse. 



The thoracic uncini (fig. 16), which are arranged in single rows, have 

 long, slender, curved stems with a slight shoulder at the surface of the 

 body and beyond it a neck ; the head has a long, rather slender, shghtly 

 recurved beak and a crest from which three larger spines are separated 

 on each side below, the rest being finely divided. The abdominal 

 uncini (fig. 43) are truncate behind, somewhat as in Laonome, but 

 with a slightly produced process ; the breast is both high and prominent 

 with a nearly square anterior margin ; the sinus is very small ; and the 

 beak acute, surmounted by a crest exhibiting 6 or 7 teeth of diminishing 

 size along the profile. 



The somewhat horny, stiff tube is covered with coarse sand grains 

 and minute bits of shell.

168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Protula geniculata sp. nov. (PI. XI, figs. 17, 18; PI. XII, fig. 38.) 



The two specimens upon which this species is fomicled were taken 

 from the tubes, and are consequent!}^ in a rather poor state of preserva- 

 tion and altered in shape by the constraint. Except for the flattened 

 and tapering caudal end the form is completely terete and the thoracic 

 membrane is -^Tapped closely about the body. Following are the 

 measurements of the type: Total length, 27 mm.; branchiae, 5 mm.; 

 thorax, 5.5 mm., and diameter of thorax, 1.2 mm. 



Branchiae remain in the type specimen only, and are so fragile that 

 a complete study is impossible. Their bases are short and simple, 

 concealed by the collar ventrally but exposed dorsally. The radioles 

 number about 18 on each side, arise strictly in one row, although in 

 the retracted condition some of the dorsalmost ones are turned inward 

 and spirally twisted, so that they appear partly in a double row. Most 

 of the radioles are rounded in section, but the dorsalmost one on each 

 side is flattened. There is no basal web. At the base of the radioles 

 the barbs are as long as one-half of the diameter of the thorax, but 

 become gradually shorter toward the tip, where they leave naked a 

 filamentous portion of the radiole about as long as the basal barbs. 

 There is no operculum. 



The strictly ventral collar is produced directly forward to a length 

 about equal to an anterior thoracic somite ; the margin is smooth and 

 entirely ^\^thout trace of any folds or incisions and -uith short rounded 

 lateral lobes. The thoracic membrane is rather prominent and pro- 

 duced anteriorly beyond the collar, but not overlapping its lateral 

 lobes. Dorsally the two sides overlap considerably in the middle hue, 

 and are thrown into deep obhque folds at each somite, owing to the 

 stowing of a large surface within the small space of the tube. Posteri- 

 orly they reach beyond the last thoracic somite and join in a closely 

 appressed ventral fold covering the first abdominal somite below. 



There are seven setigerous thoracic somites and seventy abdominal 

 somites. The bimdles of thoracic seta are all at the same level and of 

 similar size; the uncinigerous tori are short, equal and \^ddely separated 

 ventrally on all somites. The sides of the thoracic somites between 

 them are transversely wrinkled. On the abdominal region the anterior 

 tori are nearer the dorsal than the ventral side, but posteriorly they are 

 strictly lateral. At the posterior end the body is beveled toward the 

 dorsal side and is provided with low lateral ridges, but no distinct 

 caudal membrane. Dorsally this flattened region bears a narrow but 

 tliick sliield plate ^^hich tapers to an acute point anteriorly and is 

 partly metameric. It occupies about 26 somites and is Avhite and 




1904.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169 



chalky in appearance. In another specimen this plate is less attenu- 

 ated anteriorly. The body throughout is much tinged with reddish- 

 orange which was probabh^ the natural color. 



All of the thoracic setre are of the limbate type with rather short nar- 

 rowly lanceolate ends, especially slender on those of the smaller collar 

 tuft; all are colorless, very sHghtly cm-ved and of more imiform size 

 than usual. The abdominal, except at the caudal end, bear two 

 geniculate setse (fig. 38) on each side. They are transparent and color- 

 less, AAdth broad, short, very thin and pointed blades, bent nearly at 

 right angles to the shaft, and which appear to have the margin per- 

 fectly smooth. On the caudal somites the setae occur in tufts of 

 three, but occasionally two; they are long, slender, capillary, tapering 

 and curved, but wingless at the tip. 



The uncini are relatively small, very delicate, and much crowded, 

 with about 26 distinct and some smaller obscure teeth, all strongly 

 bent do^mward and overlapping. The upper part of the tooth- 

 bearing margin with the larger teeth rises prominently above the body 

 of the uncinus. The thoracic imcini (fig. 18) have the body quadrate 

 with the trimcate lower margin on a level with the elongated lower 

 tooth, while the abdominal imcini (fig. 17) have nearly triangular 

 bodies with the somewhat angulated margin not nearly reaching to 

 the end of the long tooth. This tooth is really a projection of the 

 body of the uncinus and itself bears a fringe of fine teeth on its basal 

 half. 



Two nearly complete tubes are present in the collection. They were 

 evidently attached at the base onl}'-, with the greater part upright and 

 straight or slightly sinuous, gradually increasing in diameter, perfectly 

 terete, the walls thick, porcellaneous, with a thin, somewhat rough, 

 chalky surface marked Avith distinct lines of growth, but without any 

 ridges or other special sculpturing.

into an inner and an outer series, the barbs of which face each other. 

 The radioles are thick and short, with a short, thick, finger-hke termi- 

 nation lacking barbs, and in one specimen, not enclosed in a tube, are 

 curled inward at the ends. There are no branchial eyes. Except near 

 the end, where they become shorter, the barbs have a length of about 

 f the diameter of the thorax and are nmnerous and crowded. Three 

 or four of the dorsalmost radioles each bear at the base a larger barb, 

 about 3 times as thick as the ordinary ones and somewhat longer. 

 Xear the median Hne and at a somewhat more dorsal level is the pair 

 of tentacles of similar form but somewhat stouter. A membranous 

 fold encircles the base of the gills A^lthin and siu-roimds the mouth. 

 The last three features were clearly made out on the incomplete 

 specimen only, not on the iyipe. 



The operculum (figs. 21, 21a) is dorsal and dextral. It has a slender, 

 -UTinkled, somewhat flattened stalk very shghtly broader at the distal 

 end and without Mings or membranous margins. The body of the 

 operculum is broadly egg-shaped, the basal f with soft non-chitinous 

 waUs somewhat longitudinally folded, the distal | a smooth, brown 

 and fu-m chitinous dome with a narrow thickened double ring at the 

 base and the surface with traces of a rough calcareous incrustation. 

 In the t5^e the stalk measures 4 mm. in length, .7 mm. in diameter, 

 and the body is 2.5 mjn. long and 2 mm. thick. On the larger 

 specimen these measurements are respectively 4.5, .7, 2.5 and 2 mm. 



On the type the collar and thoracic membrane are closely folded 

 about the body from contact with the tube, but evidently fully agree 

 A\dth the following description, based on their expanded state in the 

 larger cot^^pe. The collar is produced directly forward for a distance 

 of 1 mm. from the prostomium for the entire wddth of the space be- 

 tween the ventral margins of the setigerous tubercles. At the sides 

 short romid lobes are produced, but there are no other processes and 

 no clefts. The thoracic membrane extends as a broad undulating 

 fold from the first to the fifth torus inclusive, overlapping its fellow 

 medially, the lateral margin of the collar anteriorly, and the sixth torus 

 caudally. 



The first setigerous tubercle is included in the base of the thoracic 

 membrane; the others form, with the uncinigerous tori, freely project- 

 ing flaps which increase in size and prominence from the second cau- 

 dally, the last being especially large, nearly twice its predecessor, and 

 ahnost reaching the median line ventrally, while dorsally it partly 

 covers and conceals the, in this case, detached setae tuft. The body is 

 slightly flattened and tapers to the caudal end, where the nearly 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



terminal or slightly ventral anus occupies a notch. A thickened 

 dorsal shield plate, of a pink color and elongated elliptical form, occu- 

 pies about 26 somites. There are in all 7 setigerous thoracic and about 

 100 abdominal somites, though the number could not be 'accurately 

 determined, owing to an injiuy to the only complete specimen. 



The thoracic set£e present the same general features as in V. pluri- 

 annulata, but are throughout more slender, delicate and acute, and 

 have narrower -wings; the number of near!}- or quite wingless ones is 

 also greater. Throughout the greater part of the abdominal region 

 but two setaB (fig. 23) occur in each bimdle. These are delicate, 

 colorless and of the same type as in V. pluriannulata, but have 

 narrower, less angulated and less curved blades, which in the case of 

 one is almost perfectlj^ straight. 



The arrangement and form of the thoracic uncini (fig. 24) is also 

 very close in the two species, the chief difference being that in this the 

 teeth are usually 15 in number and exhibit a more exact alignment 

 with the basal plate. Very often a minute tooth occurs on the basal 

 plate just below the large truncate tooth, and the overlapping of the 

 latter by the preceding tooth is often very marked. Abdominal 

 uncini (fig. 25) differ still less, but the number of acute teeth is 11-13. 

 The caudal seta) are all broken short off. 



Only a small piece of the tube is present. It is thicker than that of 

 Vermilia pluriannulata, measures 3 mm. in diameter at the mouth, 

 which is broken, and 2.5 mm. at the opposite end. The single flange 

 present extends only halfway arovmd the tube on the free side, but is 

 very prominent and flaring. The surface of the tube is marked by 

 rough transverse lines of growth with a slight!}^ spiral turn, and on

 Vermilia pluriannulata sp. nov. (PI. XII, figs. 26-32, 45; PI. XI, fig. 19.) 



The single example from wliich this species is described measures: 

 Total length, 1 9 mm. ; branchiae, 4.5 mm. ; thorax, 3 mm., and diameter, 

 2.4 mm. The branchiae are in bad condition, but show 19 radioles on 

 each side, w'hich are shorter and have relatively longer and more slender 

 naked tips than in V. ctenophora. 



The operculum is developed from the left dorsal branchial radicle, 

 and the stalk and body each measure 2.5 mm. long. The former is 

 of nearly uniform diameter, very slightly depressed and marked with 

 numerous transverse wrinkles, as though in contraction. The body 

 (figs. 26, 27, 28) is broadly elliptical in face views, but in profile shows 

 a nearly parabolic ventral and a sHghtly convex dorsal outline. It is 




172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



divided into'two nearly equal halves, the proximal of which is soft and 

 longitudinally wrinkled, with a delicate chitinous enclosing membrane, 

 the distal very firm and chitinous, marked by 6 very narrow dark 

 chitinous annular thickenings w^hich have a slightly excentric arrange- 

 ment, as a result of which they are much crowded dorsally and more 

 \\ddely separated ventrally, lea\T.ng a nearly circular, slightly excentric, 

 convex, pale-colored terminal disk. Probably the entire distal half, 

 vnth the exception of this disk, was originally covered with a calcareous 

 coat; rough fragments of such an incrustation remain especially 

 on the ventral surface. 



The collar is higher and its lateral lobes more prolonged than in V. 

 ctenophora, but is otherwise similar. The thoracic membrane is also 

 similar, but much higher, fully equalling the dorsal distance between 

 the setse tufts. As in V. ctenophora its base ends at the fifth seta tuft, 

 but a free lobe projects much beyond this to the seventh. 



There are 7 setigerous thoracic and about 110 abdominal somites, 

 the posterior ones very short and much crowded. For most of its 

 length the body is nearly terete, but at the posterior end is slightly de- 

 pressed and tapering. The extreme caudal end is slightly curved ven- 

 trad, so that the anus looks downward and is somewhat covered by the 

 posterior margin of the dorsal plate. The latter is much thickened and 

 of an ovate form, covering about 25 somites with the broad end toward 

 the head. 



The thoracic setse are numerous, except in the collar fascicle, and 

 form conspicuous pale yellow tufts. Those of the first fascicle are 

 mostly wingless or nearly so, the hmbate ones being more slender 

 and with the -^ings narrower than usual in succeeding tufts. On the 

 succeeding thoracic somites the number of \\dngless setse is much re- 

 duced, and most of them (figs. 29 and 3.0) are stouter and distinctly 

 limbate on the convex side and, while differing considerably in length, 

 curvature and breadth of wing, they have the wings constantly wdder 

 and more delicately striated than in V. ctenophora. 



^Yith the exception of those near the caudal end each abdominal 

 fascicle bears but three colorless setse (fig. 31) with slender stems and 

 rather broad but exceedingly tliin and dehcate blades. The ends are 

 tapering and curved, with a distinct angle at the base of the convex 

 side, which is fringed for | of its length. These sette are always stouter, 

 more angulated and less distinctly fringed than those of Vermilia 

 ctenophora, and the 3 exhibit a closer similarity of form and size. A 

 number (about 25) of the segments at the caudal end bear tufts of 4 or 

 5 long, slender, colorless capillary setse of a quite different form (fig. 45). 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



They about equal or exceed the body diameter, are strongly directed 

 ventrad, and for the greater part of their length they are gently, and 

 near the tip more sharply, curved; and here are also flattened and 

 proAaded with a delicate vdng, beyond which they taper to an acute 

 point. 



The tori of somite III contain about 90 uncini and more posterior 

 thoracic somites a much greater number. They are rather large trape- 

 zoidal plates (fig. 32), coarsely striated transversely. The pecti- 

 nate margin bears 14 or occasionally 13 acute teeth, of which the 4th, 

 5th and 6th are the largest, the upper ones becoming shorter and the 

 lower or cephalic ones especially more slender, the former more hooked, 

 and the latter straighter but more imbricated and appressed, and the 

 last 2 or 3 successively wider, flatter and more cm-ved in the trans- 

 verse plane. The last tooth is much larger, tubular and truncate, and 

 in mam^ cases is more or less closely embraced by the preceding one. 

 The anterior abdominal tori bear about 20, the caudal ones as man}^ as 

 50 imcini (fig. 19), which are only about ^ as long and much more deli- 

 cate than the thoracic ones which they resemble closely in form. 

 The apical offset from the plate is more prominent, the number of teeth 

 usually 13 or sometimes 12, and the truncate tooth is more closely 

 embraced by the one next to it than in the thoracic imcini. 



Fragments of the tube are 3.5 mm. in diameter at the mouth, 2 mm. 

 in diameter at a distance of 30 mm. from the mouth. Externally they are 

 marked by a series of wide flaring flanges, sometimes completely encir- 

 cling the tube, sometimes coalescent with it or incomplete on one side. 

 The surface is marked by a varying number of delicate but rough, 

 undulating parallel longitudinal ridges about .7 mm. apart, the number 

 being usually limited to about 6, confined to one, but not always the 

 same, side. On the free flaring portions of the flanges these ridges 

 become broken into flat spines, many of which are arranged trans- 

 versely.

 Pomatostegus latiscapus Marenzeller. 



Two specimens of a Pomatostegus agree closely with Marenzeller's 

 description of all parts except perhaps the collar, concerning which it 

 is simply stated that it is produced directly forAvard and has no lateral 

 incisions. In the Albatross specimens the collar has a very irregular 

 and ragged border, with a long median ventral process and somewhat 

 smaller dorso'-lateral processes at the level of the setae; but no actual 

 incisions. The setse and operculum agree perfectly. In one specimen 

 the operculum bears 4, in the other 7 platforms, and in the latter 




174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



is completely enveloped in a growth of sponge which forms a spherical 

 mass fitting the lumen of the tube.

Pomatoceros auritubis sp. nov. (PI. XII, figs. 33-37; PI. XI, fig. 20.) 



This species is known only from a single specimen without tube which 

 measures 18.5 mm. in total length, of which the gills are 6 mm., the 

 operculum nearly 7 mm., and the verj^ short thorax, without the collar, 

 2.5 mm. The branchiae have 26 radioles on each side, and each half 

 is rolled inward in a somewhat scroll-like fashion dorsally and ven- 

 trally. The radioles are somewhat thick and are terminated by a short 

 filament free from barbs, the basal ones of which are about ^ the length 

 of the radioles. A tolerably well-developed web connects the basal f 

 of the radioles. 



The operculum (figs. 33, 34, 35) is developed from the dorsalmost 

 left radiole. Its stalk is broad and flat with prominent lateral wings 

 extending its entire length and increasing in width to the distal end, 

 wiiere they terminate in narrow, pointed processes embracing the sides 

 of the ojjercular body. The stalk is attached excentrically to the dor- 

 sal side of the body of the operculiun, which is bent strongly ventrad. 

 The body is hemispherical with somewhat flaring margins, and bears 

 by a short thick stalk on its distal face a membranous circular concave 

 plate with broad, thin, flaring margins, and a low, slightly rounded 

 central eminence. There are no spines, but two slight marks may be 

 the scars of attachment of a pair. The free margins of the disk are 

 chitinoid, but there is but little indication of calcareous infiltration, 

 the body of the operculum having about the consistency of a rather 

 soft cartilage. 



The collar is high and prominent, about equaUing the length of the 

 first two somites. Laterally it begins at the level of the first setse tufts 

 in a pair of lobes which are much overlapped by the dorsal membrane. 

 Its margin is much folded and serrated, finely on the dorsal, coarsely 

 on the ventral part, and in the median ventral region is produced for- 

 ward as a slender lanceolate lobe, but is nowhere deeply incised. The 

 thoracic membrane is low posteriorly, with a very delicate ventral fold, 

 but becomes high anteriorly with the dorso-anterior angle thrown 

 into a tuft of folds and overlapping the lateral collar lobes. 



The anterior pair of thoracic setse tufts are widely separated from the 

 others, embedded in the thoracic membrane and project forward. 

 Succeeding setigerous and uncinigerous tori of the thoracic region are 

 at first placed at a high level, but sink lower and lower until on the 

 last thoracic somite the latter are entirely on the ventral side and much 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175 



inclined forvi'ard and inward. The last two especially have their 

 ventral ends entirely free, and those of the last meet in the middle line. 

 The ventral plates, which are included in the area between the tori, 

 consequently form a nearly equilateral triangle with the apex caudad. 

 All of the abdominal somites are short and crowded, especially poste- 

 riorly, and no caudal plate or membrane is developed. The anus is 

 terminal. No pigment remains in the specimen. 



Somite I bears a compact slender tuft of pale, ghstening, lanceolate, 

 limbate setse. They differ considerably in length, width of wing and 

 cm-vature, but all have the margins very distinctly serrated. On the 

 other thoracic somites the setse are of the same form, but the wings 

 are generally shorter and broader, the bmidles less compact and more 

 spreading, and more distinctly arranged in two rows, one of larger, 

 the other of smaller setae. Abdominal somites generally bear three 

 delicate colorless setae of the form shown in fig. 36. They are appa- 

 rently not trumpet-shaped, but spatulate, with one angle of the flat- 

 tened end prolonged obliquely into a conspicuous spine upon which 

 the delicate teeth are continued. The stems are delicately longitudi- 

 nally striated. The posterior abdominal setse are all broken off. 



The thoracic micinigerous lines begin at the seta tufts and are rather 

 long, that of somite II containing a few more than 200 uncini, which 

 decrease in size toward the ventral end. Abdominal tori contain 

 little more than ^ as many. The uncini are delicate pectinate plates. 

 Those of the thoracic somites (fig. 37) have quadrate plates bearing 

 13-15 strongh' decurved, very acute teeth; the lowermost scoop-tooth 

 is broad, opens toward the uncinial plate and projects freely beyond 

 the lower margin of the latter. Abdominal uncini (fig. 20) are about 

 ^ as large and have only 11 or 12 acute teeth besides the scoop-like 

 one, and the plate is triangular, with its lowermost angle produced into 

 a process about \ as long as the lowermost tooth.

A STUDY OF THE MAMMALIAN GENUS CHILONYCTEKIS. 



BY JAMES A. G. EEHN. 



The following paper is the result of a study of an exceedingly inter- 

 esting series of one hundred and three specimens, of which twenty- 

 four were preserved as skins, the remainder being in alcohol. Of this 

 representation forty-three were from the collection of the United 

 States National Museum, thirty-six from that of the Biological Survey, 

 eighteen from the American Museum of Natural History, and a small 

 but exceedingly important series from the collection of the Academy. 



The author wishes to express his indebtedness to Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, 

 Jr., of the United States National Museum, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of 

 the Biological Survey, and Dr. J. A. Allen of the American Museum 

 of Natural History, for their kindness in securing and permitting the 

 use of specimens from the collections under their charge.

History. — The genus Chilonyderis was founded by Gray in 1839 on 

 the Cuban C. macleayii, the describer believing the genus to be inter- 

 mediate between "the Saccopteri and the genus Mormoops," the latter 

 genus being considered by him a member of the tribe Noctilionina. 

 In 1840, Gundlach described the genus Lohostoma based on two species, 

 one of which is the Cuban representative of the genus Mormoops, the 

 other a synonym of Chilonycteris macleayii. The same year Wagner, 

 in the first supplementary volume of the Saugthiere, associated the genus 

 \^^th Mormoops, and placed them in the tribe Brachyura of the Gymno- 

 rhina. During the year 1843 this genus received considerable atten- 

 tion from Wagner and Gray, the former of whom described C. per- 

 sonata, C. rubiginosa and C. gymnonotus, all from Natterer's Brazihan 

 material. The last of these three species has since been removed to 

 Dermonotus {= Pteronotus auct.). Gray's work consisted of the de- 

 scription of the Haitian C. fuliginosa and Phyllodia parnellii from Ja- 

 maica, the rather different character of the latter form having impressed 

 him to [such an extent that he created a genus for it. In comment- 

 ing on Phyllodia he says it is "a Noctihonine bat, with an apparent 

 nose-leaf, bearing a much greater resemblance to the Leaf-nosed Bats 

 (Phyllostomina) than even Mormoops, which, when he first described 

 it, Dr. Leach referred to that group." The Jamaican C. grisea was 

 the next form described, Gosse also giving us a figure. Burmeister, in 

 1854, in his system of Brazihan mammals, associated Chilonycteris 

 and Dysopes, and placed them in the Gymnura; while Wagner, in 1855, 

 placed it and Mormoops with the Noctilionine bats in the section 

 Brachyura of the Gymnorhina. The year 1861 witnessed the de- 

 scription of two more species of the genus, C. hoothi from Cuba by Gund- 

 lach, and C. osburni by Tomes from Jamaica, the latter being Gray's 

 Phyllodia parnellii. Koch in 1862-63^ used the term Mormopida in 

 an indefinite way, apparently for this association of genera; while 

 Gray, in 1866 .^ used the term Mormopsina for Mormoops, and Phyllo- 

 diana for Phyllodia, Chilonycteris and Pteronotus. Peters, in his

the family name Mormopidce. Dobson, in his historic catalogue, con- 

 sidered Chilonyderis and Mormops to comprise the group Mormopes, 

 which is coextensive with his subfamily Lobostomince. The same 

 author also describes the peculiar C. psilotis from an unknown local- 

 ity. In 1892, Harrison Allen* raised Dobson's Lobostomince to family 

 rank, the Lobostomid(B. In 1902, Miller separated the Mexican type of 

 the rubiginosa group as C. mexicana, and distinguished a Porto Rican 

 representative of the boothi group as portoricensis. While treating 

 the genus Mormoops, the author, in the same year, considered Mor- 

 moops, Chilonyderis and Dermonotus representatives of a subfamilj^ 

 for which the name Mormoopince was used. 



General Relations. — The general relationship of the genus Chilonyc- 

 teris to the other members of the Mormoopince. has already been con- 

 sidered.^ Of the species in the genus the boothi and rubiginosa groups 

 present the greatest superficial resemblance to Mormoops, particularly 

 in the broad flattened head and the general form of the chin-lappets; 

 but that, these resemblances are not supported by other characters is 

 evident on studying the skulls and structure of the ears and head 

 appendages. On the other hand, the relationship of C. psilotis with 

 Dermonotus is evident from the structure of the skull, while the rubigi- 

 nosa group is seen to possess a skull having the same general charac- 

 teristics. The arrangement of species in the following portion of this 

 paper is in accordance with the general characters exliibited by the 

 skull, running from the slender arched type of C. macleayii to the 

 heavy short depressed skull of C. psilotis. There are several objections 

 to such an arrangement, but there appears to be no good evidence to 

 support any other classification, Dobson's psilotis is no doubt the 

 most aberrant member of the genus, and, while in some tooth charac- 

 ters it appears to differ from all the other species, and also from Der- 

 monotus, its position in the genus is easily found by the shape of the 

 skull. Wagner's personata I have not seen, and probably it is closer to 

 psilotis than my treatment would lead one to suppose. This point 

 can, of course, only be settled by the examination of the specimens in 

 the Vienna and Berlin Museums, or by the acquisition of further 

 material. 



Remarks. — Probably the most striking fact noticed on examining a 

 large series of specimens of this genus is the presence of two well- 

 marked color phases, one rufous, the other dark brown. This di- 

 chromatism is evident in every form of which an extensive series is

available. The two extremes are sometimes connected by a series of 

 intermediate individuals possessing to a greater or less degree the dull 

 rather purplish-browTi of one type and the rich golden rufous or warm 

 red-brown of the other. This dichromatic coloration is also found in 

 Mormoops and Dermonotus.

[Guanajay and Baracoa, Cuba.] 



Type Locality. — Cuba. 



Distribution. — Cuba, apparently covering the greater part of the 

 island, specimens from such extremes as Baracoa and Guanajay having 

 been examined. Gundlach (1. c), in speaking of this species, says: 

 Very common, they frequent the houses in the country; observed also 

 in caves, where they sleep in clusters. 



General Characters.— Size rather small (for the genus) ; ears elongate, 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



sublanceolate, internal margin with a distinct submedian shoulder, 

 external margin with a prominent submedian dentiform shoulder ; nos- 

 trils surmounted by a sinuate ridge bearing a series of small pads, 

 nostrils flanked by a subacute protuberance. 



Head. — Moderately elongate; rostrum considerably depressed. Ears 

 elongate, sublanceolate, the lower margin extending considerably 

 forward but failing to reach the angle of the mouth; internal margin 

 of the ear attached to the head anterior to the small eye, internal ridge 

 distinct, arcuate, passing by a moderately rounded shoulder into the 

 internal margin of the ear, distal two-thirds of the internal margin of 

 the ear straight, bearing several distinct spiniform points superior to 

 the shoulder of the internal ridge ; external margin and lower margin 

 ample, bearing a distinct acute notch at a point about opposite to the 

 shoulder of the internal ridge, distal portion of the external margin 

 straight, except the extreme apical portion which is gently concave; 

 apex subfalcate, rounded. Tragus subelliptical ; external margin with 

 a slight nodular shoulder; internal margin bearing a subapical whorl- 

 like accessory flap, which lies in a plane at right angles to the body of 

 the tragus; apex rather narrowly roimded. Nostrils ovate, bordered 

 by a low ridge, superior margin slightly depressed centrally and 

 bearing six distinct sucker-like tubercles,^ lateral margins flanked by 

 an erect subdentiform flap. Labial chin-lappet transverse, forming 

 broadly rounded lobes laterally, the median portion of the inferior mar- 

 gin broadly and evenly concave, median portion of the lappet strongly 

 papillose and margined superiorly by a small roimded nonpapillose 

 area. Posterior chin-lappet slight, adpressed, rounded and consisting 

 only of a fold of skin. 



Limbs. — Forearm moderately long, rather strongly bowed in the 

 proximal half; third digit raiher short. Femora, tibise and feet rather 

 slender ; calcaneum very long, half again as long as the tibise. 



Membranes and Fur. — Membranes rather heavy and leathery; trans- 

 verse nerves very regularly disposed in the endopatagium and meso- 

 patagiimi; propatagium large, the anterior border totally free; uropa- 

 tagium very large, extending beyond the enclosed portion of tail a 

 distance about equal to the same. Fur of moderate length, soft and 

 silky; throat and chin with the fur floccose; endopatagium partially 

 and slightly furred above ; upper lip and muzzle with the hair bristle- 

 like in character. 



Color. ^ — Rufous phase : above mars-browm suffused on the back and 



' This character is subject to more or less variation, as in some specimens the 

 individual character of each protuberance is lost. 

 * From skins. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



scapular region with burnt-umber, a slight silvering of pale hairs scat- 

 tered irregularly; beneath uniform fawn color. Brown phase: above 

 sepia, aromid the head and neck paler as there the ecru under color is 

 very apparent; below pale Isabella color, the hair seal-brown basally. 

 Membranes ranging from vandyke-brown to almost pure black in color. 



Skull. — Rather fragile in character; elongate, zygomata not mark- 

 edly expanded ; brain-case considerably elevated above the moderately 

 depressed rostrum; foramen magnum placed slightly above the basi- 

 cranial axis. Brain-case subglobose, crests but slightly marked; audi- 

 tory bullae considerably inflated, of medium size. Rostrum rather 

 low, of moderate length, evenly expanded ; nasal depression consid- 

 erably excavated and visibly compressed; palate subequal in width, 

 moderately excavated, posterior projection extending but little 

 beyond the major portion, the cleft narrowly rounded; pterygoids 

 rather strongly divergent. Mandible with the ramus rather strong, 

 ascending ramus low and comparatively weak; condyle small; coro- 

 noid process very weak and not elevated above the condyle ; angle of 

 the mandible strongly developed and directed laterall}", forming a pro- 

 nounced subfalciform process. Skulls of females are considerably 

 smaller, and have the rostral portion much more bullate than in the 

 males, in this respect approaching the race inflata, from which they 

 can, however, be separated by the slenderer skull and narrow palate. 



Teeth. — Central pair of upper incisors much larger than the lateral 

 pair, broad, cutting edge bilobate; lateral incisors with a single acute 

 posteriorly placed cusp; upper canines conoid, very slightly diverging; 

 first upper premolar subreniform in basal outline, the posterior portion 

 lying against the internal border of the second premolar smaller than 

 the anterior portion ; second upper premolar with a large hastate pos- 

 teiior cusp, basal outline subpentagonous; first and second upper molars 

 subquadrate, protocone and hypocone developed as low pointed cusps ; 

 third upper molar strongly transverse, protocone developed as a jagged 

 elevation, para-hypoconoid ridge N-shaped. Lower incisors crowded, 

 equal in size, trilobate; canines slender; first lower premolar uni- 

 cuspidate, the labial face considerably excavated; second lower pre- 

 molar very minute and crowded between the first and third and dis- 

 placed toward the lingual face; third lower premolar unicuspidate, 

 slightly more acute than the first premolar; molars equal in size. 



Measurements. — Average of series:® Total length [5] 61 mm. (59-65); 



'•' Numbers in brackets designate the number of specimens examined for tha*

Remarks. — ^This species is not liable to be confused with the other 

 species of the genus, but its three subspecies are all, with the possible 

 exception of C. m. grisea, quite closely related. From macleayii grisea 

 the true macleatjii may be separated by its smaller size and the shape 

 of the superior margin of the nostrils; from m. fuliginosa the larger 

 size and heavier build will distinguish it; from m. inflata the shape of 

 the rostral portion of the skull, as well as the general slenderer 

 character of the palate and zygomata, will serve to differentiate it. 



The most striking variation exhibited by this species is the occur- 

 rence of two forms, one considerably smaller than the other. This 

 fact was first noticed by Miller {I. c), and, as he states, it appears to 

 be independent of age or sex. The series studied, while a picked lot 

 from the series he examined, do not give the extreme dimensions he 

 cites, but the two forms can very readily be distinguished. Another 

 very striking variation is in the shape of the skull, and is apparently 

 sexual. The skulls of the females examined are shorter and more in- 

 flated in the rostral portion than those of the males. In this respect 

 they approach the Porto Rican m. inflata, but the skull of that form 

 appears, in both sexes, to be more inflated and robust proportionally 

 than the smaller females of macleayii.

Distribution. — The island of Haiti and San Domingo. No specimens 

 possessing exact data available. 



General Characters. — Allied to the Cuban macleayii but the size 

 smallest in the genus, skull smaller than in macleayii and compara- 

 tively slender, and calcanea shorter. 



Head. — As in C. macleayii. 



Limbs. — Except for the generally smaller size of the forearm and 

 tibia, no difference is noted from the same portions of macleayii. The 

 calcaneum is distinctly shorter, not at all or but slightly exceeding 

 the tibia in length. 



Membranes and Fur. — As in macleayii. 



Color. — The available alcoholic specimens have been preserved for 

 quite a long time and the coloration exhibited by them may be some- 

 what abnormal. General color above cinnamon-rufous; below seal- 

 brown; volar membranes prout's-brown ; ears wood-browTi. The 

 single skin available is mummified and has been in a liquid preserva- 

 tive at some time ; the colors are as follows : above pale mars-brown ; 

 below isabelline, becoming ecru-drab on the throat; membranes drab. 



Skull. — Similar to C. macleayii but smaller, the males with the whole 

 form comparatively more robust than in the same sex of macleayii. 

 The singular abbreviate skull of the females of macleayii approaches 

 m. fuliginosa very much, but the latter has a slenderer rostrum and 

 more compressed zygomata. One specimen (5072, A. N. S. P.) bears 

 a comparatively high sagittal crest. 



Teeth. — Essentially as in C. macleayii with the following exceptions : 

 first upper premolar simpler in outline, more ovate than reniform; 

 second upper premolar more transverse in outline than pentagonal, 

 the anterior shoulder not as strongly developed as in macleayii. 



Measurements. — Average of series: Total length [1] 56.2 mm. ; length 

 of head and body [3] 40.5 (39.5-41) ; head [1] 17.1 ; ear [2] 13.6 (13.2-14) ; 

 tragus [2] 4.5; forearm [5] 37.7 (35-40); thumb [4] 6.2 (6-7); third 

 digit [5] 62.2 (58.5-68); tibia [5] 15.1 (14.5-16); calcaneum [2] 15 

 (14-16); foot [5] 8.3 (8.9); tail [5] 18.8 (17-20). 



Total length of skull [2] 14.1 (14-14.3); greatest zygomatic width-[l] 

 7.2 ; interorbital width [3] 3 ; height at base of second premolar [3] 3 ; 

 height of brain-case [2] 6 ; width of palatal constriction [2] 1 .4 ; length of 

 palate [2] 6.1 (6-6.2); width of palate including teeth [3] 5.1 (5-5.2); 

 greatest length of mandible [2] 10.5 (10-11). 



Remarks. ^-This form of macleayii, while not at all sharply defined, 

 can be recognized by the unusually small size, short calcaneum and 

 rather different skull. In a number of characters which reach their 

 extremes in macleayii and m. inflata, m. fidiginosa is intermediate, as 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



might be expected from the distribution of these forms ; but that the 

 three types are entitled to recognition will generally be admitted on 

 examining representatives of the several races.

Type. — Adult c? ; Cueva di Fari, near Pueblo Viejo, Porto Rico. 

 No. 6,234, A. N. S. Phila. March 19, 1900. Collected by Drs. C. W. 

 Richmond and L. Stejneger. 



Distribution. — Apparently the whole island of Porto' Rico, specimens 

 from a cave near Pueblo Viejo and ]\Iayaguez having been examined. 



General Characters. — This form is distinguished from true macleayii 

 by the short and bullate rostrum of the skull and the rather expanded 

 zygomata. 



Head, limbs and fur very much as in macleayii, but the distal half of 

 the ear is shorter and broader, the apex more blunt, and not so falcate, 

 the external margin being straighter. 



Color. — Rufous phase ■}^ above rather dark cinnamon ; below wood- 

 brown, the fur basally mummy-brown. Brown phase: above bistre, 

 the short hair on the nape and sides of the neck silver^-- white, the latter 

 also apparent in the general bistre tint, caused by scattered unicolored 

 hairs and also by the silver}- median bands of the darker hairs ; below 

 with the hair basally bistre, apically drab, becoming wood-bro^\'n on 

 the chin and throat and whitish on the abdomen. Membranes dull 

 blackish. One specimen examined appears to be intermediate between 

 the two phases. 



Skull. — Similar to that of C. macleayii, but with the rostrum shorter 

 and broader, the brain-case higher and the zygomata more expanded. 

 The rostrum is considerably shorter than the brain-case in length and 

 the lateral margins are rather strongh^ and evenly arcuate ; brain-case 

 strongly inflated and elevated above the rostrum a distance more than 

 equal to the height of the rostrum at the anterior margin of the orbits. 

 Palate considerably broader than in macleayii. The skulls of females 

 of macleayii are, of course, very similar to the males of m. inflata in 

 general appearance, but they lack the extreme characters of the rostrum^ 

 and the high brain-case is peculiar to inflata. The skull of the female 

 of inflata, however, is practically indistinguishable from that of 

 macleayii, though the latter is somewhat smaller. 



'" Type in this phase. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



Teeth. — Similar to madeayii but for the following exceptions : median 

 upper incisors very broad and very distinctly bilobate ; first upper pre- 

 molar small and low, considerably crowded; second lower premolar 

 shorter and broader, the basal outline more rounded and not so oblong 

 as in macleaijii. 



Measurements. — Type: Total length 63 mm.; head and body 45.5; 

 head 17.3; ear 12.5; tragus 4.8; forearm 38.5; thumb 7; third digit 

 63.5; tibia 16.5; calcaneum 18; foot 8.5; tail 18. Average of series: 

 Total length [3] 64.3 (61.5-68.5) ; head and body [5] 48.7 (41-52) ; head 

 [2] 16.9 (16.5-17.3); ear [2] 12.2 (12-12.5); tragus [2] 4.5 (4.3-4.8) 

 forearm [6] 38.7 (38-40); thumb [2] 7; third digit [2] 62.2 (61-63.5) 

 tibia [5] 15.6 (15-16.5) ; calcaneum [2] 19.7 (18-20.5) ; foot [6] 8.4 (8-9) 

 tail [4] 19.6 (17-23). 



Type skull: Total length 15.3 mm.; interorbital width 3.5; height 

 at base of second premolar 3.5; height of brain-case 6.4; width of pala- 

 tal constriction 1.5; length of palate 6; width of palate including teeth 

 5.5 ; greatest length of mandible 11. Average of series of skulls : Total 

 length [5] 14.8 (14.2-15.3); greatest zygomatic width [3] 8 (7.9-8); 

 interorbital width [5] 3.2 (3-3.5) ; height at base of second premolar [5] 

 3.3 (3.1-3.5) ; height of brain-case [5] 6.4 (6.1-7) ; width of palatal con- 

 striction [5] 1.4 (1.3-1.5); length of palate from anterior foramina [5] 

 6.1 (6-6.4); width of palate including teeth [5] 5.3 (5.1-5.5); length of 

 mandible [5] 10.8 (10.6-11.1). 



Remarks. — The foregoing description presents the differential char- 

 acters of inflata so that no general remarks are necessary. The phyla 

 represented by m. fuliginosa and m. inflata reaches its extreme type in 

 the latter race, the most apparent diagnostic character of which is the 

 inflated rostrum.

 nostrils with the superior margin deeply and squarely emarginate cen- 

 trally. 



Head. — Similar to C. macleayii with the following exceptions : Nos- 

 trils with the superior margins bearing two low quadrate peg-hke pro- 

 jections, between which is a deep emargination completely separating 

 them; process flanking the nostrils elongate, sublanceolate in char- 

 acter. Dobson's figure {vide supra) represents these characters very 

 clearly and was no doubt taken from the type specimen presented 

 by Gosse, as that was the only Jamaican specimen studied by him. 



Limbs. — Similar in character to C. mxicleayii, but, of course, larger, 

 though the proportions are practically the same. 



Membranes and Fur. — As in macleayii, but the free margin of the 

 uropatagium very curiously tucked and thickened by short longitudinal 

 thickenings, a character well exhibited in Gosse's original plate of the 

 species. 



Color. '^^ — Rufous phase : above ferruginous ; below chestnut, becom- 

 ing pale on the chin; ears and cephalic processes vinaceous-cinnamon, 

 the former becoming pale drab apically; volar membranes mummy- 

 brown. Brown phase: above bistre, sprinkled and suffused with sil- 

 very-white as in the brown phase of the other races of the macleayii 

 group; beneath clove-brown; membranes as in the rufous phase. 



Skull. — Elongate, somewhat compressed; rostrum slenderer, com- 

 paratively, than in any of the other forms of the macleayii group; 

 brain-case moderately inflated. 



Teeth. — As in C. macleayii, except for the first lower premolar which 

 is broader, with the external margin more rounded than in the typical 

 form. 



Measurements. — Average of series: Total length [4] 68.7 (66.5-74); 

 head and body [4] 45.4 (44.5-49) ; head [2] 18.3 (18.2-18.5) ; ear [4] 15.2 

 (14-16.3); tragus [4] 5.6 (5-6.5); forearm [4] 43.8 (43-44.5); thumb 

 [4] 7.5 (7-8); third digit [4] 73.7 (72.5-75); tibia [4] 16.3 (16-17); 

 calcaneum [4] 23 (20-26) ; foot [4] 9.7 (9.5-10) ; tail [4] 23.2 (22-25). 



Total length of skull [2] 16.9 (16.8-17); greatest zygomatic width 

 [2] 8 (8-8.1); interorbital space [2] 3.5; height of second premolar [2] 

 3.5 (3.5-3.6) ; height of brain-case [1] 6.3; width of palatal constriction

 of palate including teeth [3] 6; greatest length of mandible [2] 12 

 (11.9-12.1). 



Remarks. — The Jamaican form of the madeayii group is so very dis- 

 tinct from the other associated races that no general summary is neces- 

 sary. 



Specimens Examined. — Four alcoholic specimens: Lucea, Jamaica.

Type Locality. — Matto Grosso, Brazil. As Wagner afterward par- 

 ticularly mentioned St. Mncent, Matto Grosso, it is quite probable that 

 it was the exact locality from which the type was obtained. 



Distribution. — This species has a very extensive distribution, but as 

 specimens appear to be extremely rare and none are now at hand, the 

 records mentioned above constitute the only information. It will be 

 seen to range from ^latto Grosso, Brazil, to Guatemala, and eastward 

 to Venezuela. 



Description. — As no specimens have been examined in this connec- 

 tion, Wagner's description and notes in the Miinchen Ahhandlungen 

 {vide supra) are here given : 



"Die Beschaffenheit der Ohren, der Klappe, der Nase, des Lippen- 

 besatzes unci der Schneidezahne ist ganz dieselbe wie bei Ch. gymno- 

 notus.^^ Die Sporen sind ebenfalls, aber nur sehr wenig, an den untern 

 Theil des Schienbeins geheftet, und auch die Fliigel setzen sich etwa.? 

 tiefer an. Der Hauptunterschied liegt in der Behaarung, indem der 

 Riicken bei dieser Art eben so behaart ist als der iibrige Korper. Die 

 Farbe des Pelzes kann nicht mit Sicherheit angegeben werden, da das 

 einzige Exemplar in Brauntwein aufbewahrt ist. Sie scheint oben 

 schw-arz odey dunkelbraun zu seyn, unten lichtbraun, indem hier die 

 Haarspitzen weit heller sind. Mit Ch. rubiginosa kann der verschied-

Type Locality. — Jamaica. 



Distribution. — Apparently restricted to the island of Jamaica, the 

 only definite records being from the Sportsman's Hall and Oxford Cave, 

 while a series of specimens examined in this connection are from Lucea, 

 Hanover Parish. Osburn (I.e.) has given us an interesting account of 

 the species in captivity. 



General Characters. — Size rather large; ears large, subacute; the in- 

 ternal margin arcuate, the external margin with a distinct submedian 

 shoulder; tragus rounded with a distinct accessory lobe; nostrils supe- 

 riorly margined by a slight cutaneous ridge; nose bearing a distinct 

 high fleshy protuberance. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 195 



Head. — Rather elongate, depressed; rostrum rather broad. Ears 

 large, rather broad, the lower flap broad and extending forward almost 

 to the corner of the mouth; internal margin evenly arcuate, attached 

 to the head above the posterior corner of the small eye, internal ridge 

 distinct, the inferior lobe truncate ; external margin of the ear basally 

 arcuate, a distinct though shght submedian shoulder, distal half faintly 

 arcuate with a subapical concavity which throws into relief the rather 

 bhmt though slightly recurved apex. Tragus rather short, the apex 

 bkmt and rounded, the external margin with a slight submedian 

 shoulder; accessory lobe distinct and represented by a curved fold on 

 the internal side parallel with, but distinct from, the main portion of 

 the tragus. Nostrils somewhat inflated, and each siu-mounted and in- 

 ternally bordered by a low arcuate row of obscure tubercles. Lateral 

 portions of the muzzle thickened and forming a moderately elevated 

 ridge which gradually passes into the lateral portions of the upper lip. 

 Rostrum siu-rounded by a high rounded excrescence." Labial chin- 

 lappet rather narrow, strongly transverse, the median portion strongly 

 papillose, the superior margin around the semicircular chin-pad bear- 

 ing the largest papillae; inferior margin very faintly concave. Pos- 

 terior chin-lappet a simple flap almost equal to the labial lappet in 

 width, depressed. 



Limbs. — Forearm of moderate length, slightly curved in the proxi- 

 mal portion ; thumb rather heav;y'. Tibia rather heavy and stout (for 

 the genus) ; foot slender, the toes strongly compressed ; calcaneum not 

 quite half as long again as the tibia. 



Membranes and Fur. — IMembranes rather thin but strong, the endo- 

 patagium and mesopatagiimi with the nerve rami longitudinal; uro- 

 patagium moderately large and with a great number of transverse Unas 

 of hair; propatagium deep proximally, margin entirely free. Fur 

 rather thick and rather woolly in character on the lower surface, the 

 throat sparsely haired, the upper surface of the endopatagium with a 

 considerable proximal area furred. Hair on the chin-lappets and 

 muzzle rather setiform; ears with an irregular covering of white floccu- 

 lose hairs. 



Color. — This species appears to possess two color phases, which are 

 not quite so clearly defined as in some of the other forms of the genus. 

 Brown phase :" above between clove- and vandyke-brown ; below clove- 



•^ This curious outgrowth is exceedingly interesting. It is possibly analogous 

 to the nose-leaf of the Phyllostomatine bats, but this appears to be doubtful, and 

 probably it should be considered as representing a structure similar to that found 

 i n some Vespertilionino l)ats such as Antrozoxis and Corynorhinus.

196 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Feb., 



brown, the hair with a silver}^ or whitish suffusion; membranes and 

 muzzle mars-browTi, the latter portion rather pale and tending toward 

 cinnamon. Rufous phase: above dark mars-brown, the hair pale 

 at base ; below with the hair between vandyke-bro-wn and sepia basally, 

 the apical portion light and rather silvery in character ; membranes a 

 Mttle paler than in the brown form. 



Skull. — Robust and strongly built. Brain-case moderately ele- 

 vated above the rostriun, somewhat depressed longitudinaDy, but 

 rather evenly arched transversely; auditory bullae rather prominent; 

 zygomata little curved, simple, greatest width posterior. Rostrum 

 rather high, appearmg somewhat compressed when viewed from the 

 anterior aspect, merging into the brain-case with a very slight angle ; 

 nasal depression slight, shallow; palate rather deeply excavated, pos- 

 terior extension short and with the cleft acute-angulate. Mandible 

 rather slender, symphysis and anterior portion heavy; ascending 

 ramus low; angle bluntly and sHghtly recm-ved. 



Teeth. — Median upper incisors quadrate in outline, very obscurely 

 bilobate; lateral upper incisor circular in basal outline and touching 

 the anterior margin of the incisor, cusp very low; upper canine conoid, 

 very shghtly recurved; fb'st upper premolar reniform in basal outhne, 

 cusp rather low; second upper premolar trigonal in basal outline, cusp 

 moderately high, caniniform, internal cingulum rather strongly marked ; 

 first and second upper molars with the proto-hypoconoid ridge well 

 marked, the hypocone considerably the lower. Lower median incisors 

 distinctly trilobate, laterals bilobate or obscurely trilobate, all short 

 and rather crowded; lower canines somewhat divergent and shghtly 

 recurved; first lower premolar rather oblong in basal outline, cusp 

 rather acute; second lower premolar small, circular and crowded be- 

 tween the first and third premolar and forced to the internal side of 

 the toothrow, which when viewed from the labial aspect exhibits little 

 or no space between the first and third premolar ; third lower premolar 

 compressed, elongate when viewed from above, the cusp erect and some- 

 what recurved with a slight anterior accessory cusp; lower molars 

 similar in character to one another, the first the largest in the series, 

 the posterior molar with the entoconid very low when compared with 

 that cusp of the other teeth. 



Measurements. — Average of series of eight alcoholic specimens: 

 Total length 76 (73.5-81) mm. ; length of head and body 56.7 (53-60.5) ; 

 length of head 23.5 (22-25); length of ear 20.6 (19.5-21.5); length of 

 tragus 5.3 (4.5-6) ; length of forearm 53.5 (52-54) ; length of thiunb 8.2 

 (7.5-8.5) ; length of third digit 85.8 (84-87) ; length of tibia 19 (18-19.5) ;

length of calcaneiim 23 (21-24); length of foot 12.7 (12-13.4); length 

 of tail 20.9 (17-25). 



Average of three skulls: Total length 20.6 (20.2-21); greatest zygo- 

 matic width 11.1 (11-11.5); interorbital width 4 (4^4.1); height at 

 base of second premolar 4.9 (4.8-5) ; height of brain-case 7.6 (7.2-8) ; 

 breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 10; width of palatal 

 constriction 1.4 (1.4-1.5); length of palate from anterior foramina 8.6 

 (8.3-9); width of palate including teeth 7.1 (7.1-7.2); greatest length 

 of mandible 15.5 (15.2-16.) 



Remarks. — This species is not liable to be confused with any of the 

 forms of the genus except its own subspecies. From both of these 

 it may be separated by the crowded second premolar, the high rostral 

 portion of the skull and the rather slender foot. 



Specimens Examined. — Eight alcoholic specimens: Lucea, Jamaica.

 [Baracoa, Santiago, Cuba.] j 



Type Locality. — Fundador, Matanzas Province, Cuba. Gundlach 

 states that the species was also found at Guines, but Fundador was 

 fixed as the type locality by Miller and Rehn.^^ 



Distribution. — The species has been recorded from Guines, Havana 

 Province; Fundador, Matanzas Province, and Baracoa, Santiago 

 Province. From these records it would appear that the species is 

 rather generally distributed through the island . Gundlach , in speaking 

 of the species, says: Observed and not rare in various caves of the 

 departments, also gathering at night in houses in the country. 



General Characters. — Similar to C. parnellii, but differing in the dis- 

 position of the lower premolars, the more depressed rostrum and the 

 more robust form. It is also very closely related to C. p. portoricensis, 

 from which, however, it is separated by its larger size, slenderer 

 rostrum and rather depressed brain-case. 



Head. — Similar to C. parnellii, but with the ear slenderer, longer and 

 with the apical portion decidedly falcate. 



Limbs.-^Much. as in C. parnellii, except that the foot appears to be

rather stouter and heavier. As the comparable material of C. p. hoothi 

 is very hmited, this may prove to be incorrect when a larger series is 

 examined and compared. 



Membranes and Fur. — ^As in C. parnellii. 



Color. — ^As far as pubHshed references and available material goes, 

 no rufous phase is known in this race. This is no doubt due to the 

 limited material available, and fm-ther work \vdll probably show the 

 rufous type is also present in the Cuban form. Hair of the upper 

 surface silvery-gray at the base, apically dark walnut-browTi, rather 

 pale on the nape and sides of the neck, where the under color shows 

 through and considerably weakens the bro\^Ti tint; below wdth the 

 hair of the chest and abdomen bistre at the base, the tips of the hair on 

 these parts and all the hair on the throat and chin ecru-drab, this 

 color appearing stronger on the throat than on the other parts ; mem- 

 branes seal-browTi. 



Skull. — Similar to C. parnellii, but slightly larger, the rostrum 

 shghtly slenderer and lower, while the nasal impression is not as 

 marked as C. parnellii. 



Teeth. — Essentially as in C. parnellii, except that the second lower 

 premolar is not as crowded, having a place in the toothrow {i.e., placed 

 so that it is distinctly visible from either the labial or lingual aspect 

 of the tooth series), though still somewhat displaced toward the Ungual 

 side. 



MeasurerrLents. — Average of a series of four specimens : Total length 

 81.2 (76-88) ; length of head and body 64.4 (60.5-68) ; length of head'« 

 24.8 (24.2-25.5); length of ear^« 22 (21.5-22.5); length of tragus" 5.6 

 (5.3-6); length of forearm 52 (51-53.5); length of thumb 8.7 (8-9.1); 

 length of third digit 86.7 (85-90); length of tibia 19.5 (19-20); length 

 of calcaneum 21.8 (21-23); length of foot 11.6 (11-12.5); length of 

 taH" 21 (19.5-22.5). 



Average of two skulls: Total length 21 (20.8-21.2); greatest zygo- 

 matic width 11.2 (11.2-11.3); interorbital width 4.2; height at base 

 of second premolar 4.8; height of brain-case 7.4 (7.3-7.5); breadth of 

 brain-case above roots of zygomata 10; width of palatal constriction 

 1.4 (1.3-1.6); length of palate from anterior foramina 8.7 (8.6-8.8); 

 width of palate including teeth 7.2 (7.2-7.3) ; greatest length of man- 

 dible 15.7 (15.5-16).

Type Locality. — Cueva di Fari, near Pueblo Viejo, Baj^amou'district, 

 Porto Rico. 



Distribution. — Known only from the type locahty, but probably 

 found in suitable localities throughout the island. 



General Characters. — Similar to C. p. boothi, but the size is less, 

 while the skull is somewhat inflated. 



Head. — Essentially as in C. p. boothi, except that the ears appear to 

 be slightly smaller with the apical portion blunter and less falcate. 



Limbs. — Except for the slight difference in proportions, essentially 

 as in C. p. boothi. 



Membranes ami Fur. — As in C. p. boothi. 



Color. — Above dark broT\Ti, between Ridgway's mars-browTi and 

 bistre, pale on the nape where the ecru-drab under portion of the hair 

 is very evident; below dark gray, the base of the hair on the abdomen 

 and chest seal-bro-^ai, on the throat and chin pale Isabella color; mem- 

 branes blackish-browm. The remarks made under C. p. boothi concern- 

 ing color phases also apply to this form. One specimen shows a sHght 

 approach toward the rufous form. 



Skidl. — Similar to that of C. p. boothi, except that the brain-case is 

 more arched transversely and the rostrum is distinctly broader and 

 heavier. This character is interesting, as it is paralleled by a similar 

 development in the Porto Rican form of the macleayii group. 



Teeth. — Essentially as in C. p. boothi. 



Measurements. — Average of series: Total length [5] 77.3 (74-79); 

 length of head and body [5] 57.8 (54-66); length of head [4] 23 (21.5- 

 24.3) ; length of ear [4] 20.5 (19.7-22) ; length of tragus [4] 5.3 (5-5.7) ;

 length of calcaneum [4] 22.9 (19-25) ; length of foot [5] 11.8 (10:5-12.5) ; 

 length of tail [4] 21 (19.5-23). 



Dimensions of one skull: Total length 20.5; greatest zygomatic 

 width 11.1; interorbital space 4; height at base of second premolar 

 4.8; height of brain-case 7.5; breadth of brain-case above roots of 

 zygomata 9.8; width of palatal constriction 1.4; length of palate from

Remarks. — This race needs special comparison with only one form, 

 C. parnellii boothi. From it portoricoisis can be distinguished by the 

 rather smaller size and the form of the skull. The ears do not seem to 

 be as good a diagnostic character as those given here, but still there is 

 a slight difference in the shape of the same. From C. parnellii the 

 same characters that distinguish C. p. hootki can be applied to this 

 subspecies.

Type Locality. — Caigara, upper Amazon, Brazil. 



Distribution. — Upper Amazon region of Brazil, north to Guatemala, 

 east at least to Trinidad. The specimens from the latter island may, 

 when further material has been examined, prove to be a distinct race. 

 Tliis form no doubt intergrades with C r. mexicana, as specimens of 

 the latter race from southern Mexico approach true rubiginosa in pro- 

 portions. The specimen from Guatemala measured by Dobson {I. c.) 

 was without doubt true rubiginosa. 



General Characters. — Size large (largest in the genus) ; ears wdth the 

 internal margin entire; tragus apically produced and with a slight 

 accessory lobe; nose with a low rounded tubercle. 



Head. — ^JVIoclerately long, depressed; crown moderately elevated 

 above rostrum. Ears erect, apicalh^ acute; internal margin evenly 

 arcuate, the inferior lobe rectangulate ; external margin slight]}' con- 

 cave in its upper half, median notch rectangulate, rather small, the 

 angle of the inferior shoulder rounded, lower portion of the external 

 margin evenly rounded and carried, forward to near the angle of the

moutli, at which point it rather abruptly and squarely terminates. 

 Tragus sublanceolate ; apex acutely produced ; external margin evenly 

 rounded, with a slight emargination and thickening of the proximal 

 ])ortion; internal margin thickened and bearing a slight accessory lobe, 

 which takes the form of a subarcuate longitudinal thickening of the 

 internal margin. Nose, a distance back from the nostrils, -w ith a rather 

 low, rounded, subtransverse excrescence, anterior from which extend 

 three impressed lines, the lateral ones strong, extending down to and 

 flanking the nostrils, median one fainter and dividing the nostrils. 

 Nostrils subovate, each cro\\Tied bj^ a ver}^ low transverse fleshy ridge, 

 each bearing several very poorly defined flat disk-like structures; 

 median line between the nostrils flanked by a row of several indistinct 

 nodular processes. Labial chin-lappet strongly transverse, arcuate; 

 lateral portions without papillae; median portion strongly and very 

 distinctly papillose, and margined superiorly by a semicircular unim- 

 pressed area. Posterior chin-lappet a simple adpressed fold half the 

 width of the labial chin-lappet. 



Limbs. — Forearm moderately long, slightly and evenly bowed ; third 

 digit of medium length. Forearm, tibise and feet rather robust, the 

 toes occupying about half the length of the foot; calcaneum rather 

 short, exceeding the tibiae by a fifth the length of the latter. 



Membranes and Fur. — Membranes leathery, but not hea^-y; veins 

 of the endopatagium and mesopatagium regularly longitudinal, those 

 of uropatagium irregularly radiating from the point of exit of the tail ; 

 uropatagium large; propatagium deep, free its entire length. Fur 

 uniformh' distributed over the body, and extending a moderate dis- 

 tance on the endopatagium, both above and below; hair around the 

 muzzle rather setiform in character. 



Color." — Above mars-brown, with a slight hoary frosting posteriorly; 

 below prout's-browTii posteriorly suffused with pale ochraceous. Mem- 

 branes sepia. The red phase is also present in this species, as both 

 Wagner and Dobson mention it. 



AVagner possessed two specimens, one in each phase. He describes 

 the red phase as follows: The color of the upper and the under side 

 is a uniform rusty cinnamon-red, that of the upper side of the body by 

 the nape and the breast brighter, on the belly lighter with scat- 

 tered spots of light brown. On the upper side the hair is unicolor for 

 its entire length ; on the belly the greater under part is dark with lighter 

 tips. The flying membranes are brownish, the nails of the hind foot 

 >oiled horn -brown. The second example is a dark color.

Remarks. — This species is unlikely to be confused with any form of 

 the genus except the race mexicana, which can readily be separated by 

 the size and the intensity of the coloration in the browTi phase. From 

 the hootlii group it can readily be separated by the characters given 

 in the key of species.

 uals:

Guerrero; Morelos; Huiltepec, Oaxaca; Mexico.] 



Type Locality. — San Bias, Tepic, ^Mexico. 



Distribution. — Specimens have been examined from localities reach- 

 ing from Tehuantepec and Huiltepec, Oaxaca to Chacala, Durango, 

 while individuals from Mirador, Vera Cruz, are perfectly typical. To 

 the south, no doubt, this form grades into true rubiginosa, as the speci- 

 mens from southern Mexico average larger than those from around the 

 type locality. 



Miller says of this form: "At San Bias Chilonycteris mexicana was 

 very common in a small narrow cave which extended like a deep 

 crevice into the base of the cliff on the hillside facing the town." 



General Characters. — Similar to C. rubiginosa but smaller, and the 

 browTi phase of coloration hghter. 



Limbs. — As in rubiginosa, but for the smaller size. 



Membranes and Fur. — ^As in rubiginosa. 

 '^^ Color. — BrowTi phase : above prout's-brown, rather pale on the nape ; 

 below with the hair seal-bro\ra basally with broccoli-brown tips, the 

 color weak on the throat due to the thinner character of the pelage. 

 Ears and membranes clove-brown. 



Rufous phase: entire body and head rich tawoiy-ochraceous, the 

 hairs of the under surface browm at base (varying from cinnamon on 

 the throat to mummy-brown on the abdomen). Ears and membranes 

 clove-brown. 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



The two color phases appear to run together as several specimens 

 examined are almost intermediate, for while the upper surface will 

 incline toward the brown phase, the lower surface strongly resembles 

 the rufous form. The type, described by Miller, apparently does not 

 represent the extreme of the brown phase. From the specimens 

 examined the bro^^^l phase may be said to be commoner than the 

 rufous form. 



Skull and Teeth. — Except for the difference in size, the skull and 

 teeth are as in Ch. rubiginosa. 



Measurements. — Average of representative series of fourteen speci- 

 mens: Total length 78.8 (77-85); length of head and body 58.8 

 (56.5-63.5); length of head 23.6 (22.5-24.5); length of ear 20.5 (18.5- 

 22.1); length of tragus 5.8 (5-6.4); length of forearm 56.5 (54-59); 

 length of thumb 9.8 (9.1-11); length of third digit 93 (87-97); length 

 of tibia 20.2 (19-22); length of foot 12.9 (12.5-13.5); length of tail 

 21.2 (19.4-23.5). 



Average of eleven skulls: Greatest length 21.2 (20.9-22); greatest 

 zygomatic width 11.8 (11-12.5); interorbital width 4.4 (4.2-4.8); 

 breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 10.3 (10.1-10.5); 

 height at base of second premolar 4.8 (4.6-5.1); height of brain-case 

 8 (7.8-8.2); width of palatal constriction 1.6 (1.4-1.8); length of 

 palate from anterior foramina 8.5 (8.3-9.2) ; wddth of palate including 

 teeth 7.4 (7-7.9); greatest length of mandible 15.8 (15.4-16.5). 



Remarks. — This race can easily be distinguished from true rubiginosa 

 by the difference in size. 



Specimens Examined. — Forty-six specimens; eight skins, thirty-six 

 alcoholic individuals, one odd skull:

Type Locality and Distributioyi. — Dobson's types (cP and 9) came 

 from an unknowai locality, and mitil the recent record of the species 

 by Miller (vide supra) nothing was known regarding its habitat. The 

 Isthmus of Tehuantepec is accordingly the only locality from which 

 the species is kno\\Ti. 



General Characters. — Size medium; ear without distinct notch on 

 the external margin ; toes distinctly longer than the remainder of the 

 foot. 



Head. — Rather short and broad; rostrum moderately depressed, 

 bearing on its superior aspect a distance back of the nosa a trans- 

 verse, arcuate fleshy ridge, equal in width to the nose-pad itself. 

 Ears moderately elongate, rather broad (for the genus), apically sub- 

 lanceolate, the lower margins extended considerably forward, but 

 failing to reach the angle of the mouth; internal margin of the ear 

 attached to the head superior to the eye, internal ridge distinct, thick- 

 ened, slightly arcuate, evenly rounded inferiorly and passing by a 

 well-marked shoulder into the internal margin of the ear, distal two- 

 thirds of the internal margin arcuate, slightly sinuate toward the apex 

 and furnished about half-way between the apex and the shoulder of 

 the internal ridge with a series of four small tooth-like projections ; 

 external margin basally convex, apically concave, without any distinct 

 notch; apex rather slender, subfalciform, narrowly rounded. Tragus 

 oblong, apex rather acute, accessory flap small and rounded. Nos- 

 trils transversely ovate, superior margin with a rather low ridge which 

 is divided into about six parts by shallow incisions, lateral margins 

 flanked by low rounded fleshy folds. Labial chin-lappet strongly 

 transverse, bearing a raised margin laterally; inferior margin very 

 broadly and slightly concave, median portion of the lappet with 

 rather obscure papillse; superior margin with a deep median emar- 

 gination, which lodges the simple lip-pad. Posterioi"* chin-lappet 

 slight, a simple fold ec{ual in width to the labial fold, against which it is 

 closely set. 



Limbs. — Forearm moderately long, considerably bowed in the proxi- 

 mal half. Femora and tibia? moderately robust (for the genus) ; foot 

 elongate, somewhat compressed, considerably more than half the length 

 of the foot occupied by the toes ; calcanea but slightly longer than the 

 tibia? and provided with a free apex. 




206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Membranes and Fur. — Membranes thin and rather papery in char- 

 acter; transverse nerves of the endopatagium and mesopatagium very 

 regularly disposed; propatagium much as in madeayii, but the distal 

 portion is rather narrower ; uropatagiimi rather large, extending beyond 

 the enclosed portion of the tail a distance equal to the same. Fur of 

 moderate length and extending evenly a short distance out on the 

 dorsal surface of the endopatagium; both surfaces of the endopatagium 

 and uropatagium with scattered inconspicuous hairs; muzzle with a 

 niunber of long setiform hairs. 



Color. — As the only available specimen is an old alcoholic individual, 

 the colors are possibly not what might be seen in fresh specimens. 

 Above vandj^ke-bro^vn, rather pale on the loins; beneath drab, with a 

 clouding of pale whitish. Muzzle, naked spots on head and ears wood- 

 bro"RTi, the latter rather darker than the other portions. INIembranes 

 mummy-browTi, paler on the propatagium, proximal portions of the 

 endopatagium and vu-opatagium than on the remaining sections. 

 Dobson describes the color as follows: ''Fur orange above and beneath 

 with orange-broviTL extremities; darker above, paler beneath." 



Skull. — Comparatively short and robust, the rostral portion moder- 

 ately inflated and the nasal depression rather broadly and deeply exca- 

 vated. Brain considerably inflated and moderately elevated above 

 the rostrum, into which it evenly descends, crests hardly visible; 

 zygomata moderately expanded ; interorbital constriction not strongly 

 marked. Palate subequal in -width (not including teeth), moderately 

 arched, posterior projection of Httle extent, the cleft obtuse-angulate ; 

 pterygoids strongly divergent. Mandible very similar to that of C. 

 madeayii, but the length is less, the build heavier and the angle dis- 

 tinctly falcate. 



Teeth. — Upper median incisors broad, rather faintly bilobate; lateral 

 upper incisors small and closely pressed to the median pair and sepa- 

 rated from the canines by a considerable space ; upper canines moder- 

 ately long, very slightly curved; first upper premolar oblong in basal 

 outline, longitudinal disposed and bearing a single low cusp; second 

 upper premolar subpentagonal in basal outline, the single cusp acute 

 and subcaninif orm ; first and second upper molars wiih the hypoconid 

 region developed into a rather projecting rounded lobe which is very 

 apparent. Lower incisors small, trifid; lower canines straight; first 

 lower premolar subrotundate in basal outline with the cusp rather 

 blunt; second lower premolar minute and displaced to the inner side 

 of the toothrow; third lower premolar subquadrate in basal outline; 

 lower molars ver}' much as in C. madeayii.

Measurements}^ — Total length 62 mm.; head and body 46; ear 

 (from meatus) 15.8; tragus 5; forearm 44; thumb 8; third digit 71; 

 tibia 17; calcanemn 19; foot 9 (8); tail 16. 



Total length of skull 15 nmi. ; greatest zygomatic width 8.2; inter- 

 orbital width 3.7; height at base of second premolar 4; height of brain- 

 case 6.5; width of palatal constriction 1.2; length of palate 6; width 

 of palate including teeth 5.5; greatest length of mandible 10.5. 



Remarks. — This species hardly requires comparison with any in the 

 genus, being smaller and differing in general aspect from the hoothi and 

 ruhiginosa group, wliile the macleoyii type may easily be separated by 

 the form of the ear. The skull closely resembles that of Dermonotus, 

 but it is slenderer with a narrower interorbital region and different 

 shaped premolars. As the species seems to approach Dermonotus in 

 some characters, I have placed it at the end of the genus, all the other 

 forms appearing to be more homogeneous, a fact rather strongly 

 demonstrated by the form of the skull. 



Specimens Examined. — One alcoholic; Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 

 Mexico. (U. S. N. M.)

ON THE GERM CELLS AND THE EMBRYOLOGY OF PLANARIA SIMPLISSIMA, 

 BY N. M. STEVEXS. 



This planarian. which is found in small streams about Biyn Mawr. 

 was identified provisionally in 1900 by Woodworth as Planaria luguhris. 

 and has since figured under that name in several of Prof. T. H. Mor- 

 gan's papers on regeneration; also in my ''Notes on Regeneration in 

 Planaria luguhris" (Stevens, '01). 



On looking up the European species (P. lugiibris) as described and 

 figured by Schmidt ('59, PI. Ill, figs. 5 and 6), and by Kennel ('79, 

 PL VII, fig. 8), I felt sure that Woodworth must have been mistaken as 

 to the species; but I was imable to find any correct description or 

 figures, either of the external characters of the animal or of its repro- 

 ductive organs, and I was inclined to call it a new species. In Sep- 

 tember, 1903, after this paper was written, I came across an article 

 by Ciu-tis ('00) on the reproductive organs of Planaria simplissima 

 n. sp. The reproductive organs of this species were so strikingly like 

 those of the form on which I had been working that, although there was 

 considerable difference in form, size and color, I was convinced that 

 the two worms must be closely related, if not local varieties of the same 

 species. 



In answer to my inquiries about Planaria simplissima, Prof. Curtis 

 has recently written me that after stud3dng specimens sent to him by 

 Prof. Morgan from Bryn Mawr, and sectioning others of the same spe- 

 cies found near Baltimore in 1900 and 1901, he concluded that the 

 WilhamstowTi form, P. simplissima (fig. B), and the Bryn Mawr form 

 P. (luguhris), (fig. A) belonged to the same species. Prof. Curtis 

 desires me to state that his description of the external characters of 

 P. simplissima was made from fixed material, living specimens not 

 being accessible w^hen he discovered that he was dealing with a new 

 species. Later observations on living specimens from Willi amstown 

 made it apparent that his description was at fault, especially with re- 

 gard to the lateral cephalic appendages which are more marked than 

 was evident in fixed material. A careful sketch, made at this time 

 from the living animal and sent to me with his letter, is a good repre- 

 sentation of a young specimen of the Bryn Ma^\T form (figs. A and B)

The original object of this paper was a discussion of the reproduc- 

 tive organs, ovogenesis, spermatogenesis and embryological develop- 

 ment of Planaria (Ingubris). The discovery that it is not P. lugvhris 

 but P. simplissima Cm'tis renders further discussion of the reproductive 

 organs unnecessary, and I shall therefore confine my attention to a 

 study of the germ-cells and the embryology of this species, which pre- 

 sents some peculiarities not fully described by Ijima ('84) and Hallez 

 (79). 



Fertilization. — Copulation has not been observed in this species, 

 but there is every reason for supposing that it occurs, for spermatozoa 

 are foimd only in the vasa deferentia, the lumen of th6 penis, the 

 uterus and the oviduct. In nearly every specimen the anterior end 

 of the oviduct is crowded wdth spermatozoa (PI. XIII, fig. 1, od), while 

 only occasionally one is found in the posterior part of the duct or in 

 the uterus. The spermatozoa are never found among the oocytes in 

 the ovary, and it isjprobable that each egg is fertilized 'as it enters 

 the oviduct, for the spermatozoon is always found in the eggs of a 

 forming capsule, and no spermatozoa are found among the eggs and 

 yolk. 



I should therefore agree with Ijima in regarding the uterus as a 

 gland for forming the cocoon shell, and not as the 

 place where fertilization occurs (Hallez) , or as a re- 

 ceptaculum seminisj( Kennel) . 



When an egg-capsule is forming, the antrum, 

 uterus and the tube x (fig. C) are all thro^Ti into 

 one chamber, which is filled with eggs and yolk- 

 cells, the penis being pushed back against the 

 anterior wall of the} antrum (fig. E) and the antrum 

 being separated from the pharjmx-chamber by so 

 thin a layer of tissue that it is often broken through 

 in fixed specimens, and yolk-cells are found in the 

 pharynx-chamber. 



Ovogenesis. — The early stages in the development 

 of the oocytes evidently should be studied in the 

 summer after laying-time, for the ovaries are practi- 

 cally unchanged in appearance from October to lay- 

 ing-time in April. Figure 1, drawn from a section 

 cut in November, shows nearly all of the oocytes 

 in the same condition as in sections containing the 

 first maturation-spindle (cut in April and May).

contains here and there a yolk-granule in a vacuole (fig. 2a, y). The 

 nucleus is very large and shows but Httle stainable chromatin, and 

 that in the form of fine granules on threads of linin. The large nu- 

 cleolus, which stains deeply with orange, contains one or more 

 vacuoles. As in my previous work on the histolog}^ of planarians 

 (Stevens, '02), the best results were obtained by fixing the material 

 ulth sublimate-acetic and staining TNith Delafield's hsematoxj'lin and 

 orange. 



The first maturation-spindle is found in the ovary about twenty- 

 four hours before laying. In an equatorial stage the spindle is near 

 the centre of the egg. The asters are ver\^ large, but there is no evi- 

 dence of centrosome or sphere. The chromosomes are V-shaped, 

 and split longitudinally, gi\'ing V-shaped daughter chromosomes, as 

 in figs. 3a and 3fe. Only four specimens in this stage were obtained 

 out of a large number sectioned; and of these, three had either 3 

 chromosomes in an equatorial plate (figs. 2a and 26) or 6 daughter 

 chromosomes (figs. 3a and 36), and one had 4 in the equatorial plate 

 (fig. 4). Time and material were lacking to trace the egg from the 

 ovary to the uterus, after it was ascertained that an interval of about 

 twenty-four hours occurred between the formation of the first and 

 second polar bodies. 



By removing the capsule before the shell is formed and staining with 

 Schneider's aceto-carmine, the second maturation-division can be 

 more advantageously studied than in sections. Figs. 8-11 were made 

 from such preparations; figs. 5a, 56 and 6, from sections. In only 

 two cases was the first polar body observed (figs. 6 and 8), and it seems 

 probable that it is usually lost as the egg passes down the oviduct. 

 The number of egg-chromosomes is 3 in most cases. In two eggs from 

 the same capsule the number was 6 (figs. 9 and 10), and in a few others 

 4 and 5 were observed, indicating that, as in Ascaris megalocephala 

 and Echinus microtuherculatus, there may be two forms which occa- 

 sionally interbreed, one having twice as many chromosomes as the 

 other. 



Thus an egg having 6 chromosomes fertilized by a spermatozoon 

 having 3 would give an individual having 9 somatic chromosomes 

 and probably 5 chromosomes in germ-cells after reduction. Union 

 of germ-cells having 3 and 5 chromosomes respectively would result in 

 an individual having 8 chromosomes in somatic cells, and 4 in oocytes 

 and spermatozoa. 



Figure 8 shows an egg in which there was no doubt about the number 

 3 in the first polar body (p*), and at the poles of the second maturation- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 213 



spindle {p- and e). Figure 7 is a somatic cell containing 6 chromo- 

 somes. Six have also been counted several times in the first segmenta- 

 tion-division. That the second maturation-dixdsion of the chromo- 

 somes is longitudinal like the first one is evident from the form of the 

 chromosomes and from the pairs seen at a and h in fig. 10. Figure 

 1 1 shows the second polar bodj^ separating from the egg. 



Spermatogenesis. — ^As in the case of the ovaries, the testes should 

 be studied in summer after laying-time, in order to follow the develop- 

 ment of the spermatogonia, but occasional divisions of spermatogonia 

 and both spermatocj^te-di visions may be observed in material pre- 

 served at any time during the autumn and winter. ]\Iy best material 

 was fixed about the first of December. PI. XV, fig. 15, shows a part 

 of the section of a testis which contained dividing spermatogonia (a), 

 both maturation-divisions {e and /), spermatids in all stages {g, h, i, k, 

 I), and ripe spermatozoa. In this animal the number of chromosomes 

 in the maturation-divisions was 4, in the spermatogonia 8. In several 

 others only 3 were found in the spermatocj^tes (figs. 20 and 22). Vari- 

 ous phases of the first maturation-division are sho-^ii in figs. 16-21 

 and of the second in figs. 22 and 23. The form of the chromosomes 

 in all phases of both divisions is the same, a Y-shape, easily distinguish- 

 able from the V-shaped and U-shaped chromosomes of the spermato- 

 gonia and somatic cells. There is no evidence of a transverse, or 

 reducing, division. In an anaphase (figs. 20 and 22), each daughter 

 chromosome appears to be drawn toward the pole of the spindle bj- a 

 single fiber attached to the stem of the Y. The spindle is composed of 

 very few fibers, and neither centrosomes nor asters have been demon- 

 strated. The spermatocytes before division appear as in fig. 15, d, 

 and nothing corresponding to the sjTiapsis stage described by various 

 authors has been found. The spermatogonia in both resting and 

 division-stages closely resemble the so-called embryonic or paren- 

 chyma cells which are scattered through the planarian body and play 

 a conspicuous role in regeneration (fig. 15, a). 



Figs. 24-32 show various stages in the development of the sperma- 

 tozoon. The nucleus of the spermatid contracts, forming a small ball 

 of nuclear material which stains deeply and uniformly (figs. 24-27, a). 

 This concentrated nucleus gradually elongates (figs. 27, 6-29), and 

 finally leaves the cytoplasm tail first (figs. 15 and 29). Many empty 

 spermatid cells are showTi in fig. 15; n. The spermatozoon appears to 

 be formed wholly from the nucleus of the spermatid, and stains Uke 

 chromatin throughout. The spermatozoa in the oviduct near the 

 ovary have a knob-like appendage near the anterior end (fig. 32) 




214 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



This appears to be a late development, as it is not found on the sperma- 

 tozoon in the testes, vasa deferentia, or lumen of the penis. 



Embryological Development. — ^As stated above, the j&rst maturation- 

 division of the egg occurs in the ovary; fertihzation probably takes 

 place in the oviduct; and the second maturation-division is foimd in 

 the forming capsules. The eggs of capsules just laid always show the 

 two pronuclei with very large nucleoh. as in PI. XIII, fig. 12, and a 

 few hours later the pronuclei are fused as in fig. 13, but the two 

 nucleoh are distinct. The development of the eggs during the first 

 day can be best studied in aceto-carmine. Sections of these and of 

 older capsules may be obtained by piercing the sheU -nith a needle and 

 fixing in subhmate-acetic. The sheU must be removed before embed- 

 ding. The rate of development varies greatly in different capsules, and 

 even among the eggs of the same capsule. Laying occurs in the morn- 

 ing from dayUght to ten o'clock. In one case the first cleavage-spindle 

 was found at 10.30 A.M. in one egg of a capsule, in which aU the others 

 showed the pronuclei not fused. In other capsules eggs containing 

 the pronuclei were found as late as 5 P,M. Two, four and eight-ceUed 

 stages were also occasionally found late in the afternoon. Figure 14, a, 

 was from an egg stained with aceto-carmine at 4,30 P,M. There 

 were 6 chromosomes at each pole, as shown in fig. 14, b, obtained by 

 focussing down on one end of the spindle. As in the maturation- 

 divisions, neither centrosome nor sphere could be demonstrated. 



The peculiar positions taken by the blastomeres in 2, 4 and 8-ceUed 

 stages is shown in PI. XIII, figs, 33-36. Fig. 35 is a reconstruction 

 from five successive sections. Fig. 36 is a section of a 32-celled stage 

 in which the yolk-cells near the group of blastomeres have begun to 



break down in the region x x. The next stage (PI. XV, fig. 



37) shows a section of an embryo, consisting of a syncitial yolk- 

 mass (y^), distinct from the surrounding yolk-cells and disintegi-ated 

 yolk-material. The group of blastomeres is always irregular in 

 orm and eccentrically situated, coming to the surface on one 

 side of the yoLk-mass. Some of the blastomeres soon begin to wander 

 through the syncitium, and may be found dividing at any point. A 

 section of a capsule at this stage frequently shows sections of three 

 or four such embryos. The embrj^'onic yolk-mass gradually increases 

 in size, as may be seen by, comparing figs. 37-40, all drawn udth the 

 same magnification. The embryo is partly or wholly smrounded by a 

 region of disintegrated yolk-cells (fig. 37, a), from wliich material for 

 the embryonic syncitium is e\adently dra\vn. In some cases whole 

 yolk-cells appear to be taken into the SAmcitium in amoeboid fashion.

In fig. 38, pS the fii'st cells of the embn-onic pharynx are distin- 

 guished from the surrounding blastomeres by their different staining 

 qualities. Figs. 39-41 show the characteristic structure of such a 

 pharynx which is well developed, but not yet functional. Fig. 40 

 is a median vertical-section through the pharynx, fig. 39 a median 

 cross-section through the central cells (6), and fig. 41 a cross-section 

 through the four inner cells (d) . The cells which sm-round the lumen 

 of the pharynx are twelve in number — four somewhat flattened sur- 

 face cells (a), four cylindrical central cells (6), and four nearly spherical 

 inner cells (d). Metschnikoff ('83) suggests that the latter group of 

 four cells, supposed by some to represent the primary endoderm, may 

 serve as a valve to prevent the escape of j^olk-cells. The central cells 

 are surroimded by a considerable nmnber of smaller cells radially 

 arranged and supposed to be muscle-cells serving to open the pharynx. 

 Figs. 39 and 40 also show wandering blastomeres in all parts of the 

 sjTicitial yolk-material of the embryo. A few of these are flattened 

 to form a partial epithehum. Fig. 42 is a section through a functional 

 pharynx taking in yolk-cells (y"^). The central cells (6) are much flat- 

 tened to form the lining of the lumen, and the muscle-cells are length- 

 ened radiall}^ The two inner cells shown in dotted outline belong 

 to the next section. 



Up to the time when the embrj^onic phar^aix becomes functional, 

 the embryo is a solid ball of yolk in the form of a syncitium containing 

 scattered blastomeres, with the developing pharynx at one side, in 

 the region where segmentation began. Here and there over the siu-- 

 face are flattened blastomeres forming an incomplete epithehum 

 (figs. 39-40). As the yolk is sucked in, the embryo becomes a hollow 

 ball filled with j^olk-cells (figs. 43-47). [In these and the following 

 figures the space occupied by the yolk cells sucked in by the embryonic 

 pharynx — the secondary yolk (if) — ^is not filled in.] Fig. 43 is a 

 section of a nearly spherical embryo from a capsule in which some j^olk 

 still remained around the embryos. Fig. 44 is a cross-section of a 

 flattened embr3^o of full size, all the yolk outside of the embryos having 

 disappeared. In these sections the blastomeres (6) are scattered in 

 the primary j^olk-material (y^) of the embryonic surface layer of the 

 embryo, and still possess the characteristics of the 'earlier blastomeres, 

 deeply-staining cytoplasm and large nucleus containing a conspicuous 

 nucleolus. Figs. 45 and 46 show parts of sections from somewhat 

 older embrj'OS, where the embryonic pharynx (p^) is degenerating and 

 the blastomeres have multiplied so as to nearly fill the embryonic 

 layer, very little j^olk remaining among them. The embryonic pharynx 




216 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



disappears complete!}^ before the adult phar\aix begins to form, but 

 its relation to that pharynx appears to be the same as in P. viaculata, 

 as recently described by Curtis ('02). In fig. 45 the ventral side of 

 the embryonic layer is easily distinguishable from the dorsal side by 

 its greater thickness, and the degenerating pharynx (p^) is on the dorsal 

 side, as in Curtis's fig. 51, PL 17. The embryonic pharynx disappears 

 so early, when many of the embryos are quite irregular in form, that 

 it is impossible to tell whether it has a fixed position relative to the 

 permanent pharynx or not, but my impression is that its position is 

 variable. There is no evidence whatever that the embryonic pharynx 

 serves as a tube leading to the anlage of the permanent pharynx, as 

 described by Metschnikoff ('83) for Planaria pohjchroa. 



Fig. 47 is from a 4-day embryo in which the pharjmx-chamber 

 appears as a split in the thickened ventral region of the embr}^©. In 

 this stage pigment and rhabdites have begun to appear in the surface 

 epithelium-cells, and rhabdite-cells are found among the embryonic 

 cells, which are no longer like the early blastomeres, but closely resem- 

 ble the embr3^onic cells of newly regenerated regions of adult planarians. 

 Figs. 48 and 49 are sections of an older embryo (5-6 days), showing 

 the permanent ectoderm well developed and full of pigment and 

 rhabdite-cells. So far as I am able to determine, the ectoderm is 

 formed from the outer embryonic cells and not by di\asion of the earlier 

 scattered epitheHum-cells. There is considerable evidence that rhab- 

 dite-cells migrate from the interior to the surface and become a part of 

 the ectoderm. In this embryo (figs. 48-51) the phar\aix (p^) is quite 

 large and has a lumen connected with the central yolk-area (fig. 50). 

 The 3-olk-area is being gradual!}^ divided up by strands of cells extend- 

 ing inward from the surface la3^er of embrj^onic cells to form the bomid- 

 aries of the axial gut and its principal branches. Fig. 52 is from an 

 older embryo (7 or 8 days), in which the development of the digestive 

 tract is quite far advanced. In fig. 49 there is a section of a very young 

 eye (e), the pigmented cup consisting of only 5 or 6 cells. No brain 

 is yet distinguishable, but the lateral nerve-cords are represented by a 

 few strands of nerve -fibers (n). In fig. 52 the eye is much further 

 advanced and the nerve-cords are larger. The eyes in all embryos of 

 this age are situated much deeper in the tissue than in the adult. 

 There is as yet no definite endoderm, but here and there are cells with 

 nuclei like those of adult endoderm-cells, and processes extend out 

 from them among the 5'olk-cells as seen in fig. 51, e. 



Fig. 53 is a cross-section of an embryo just before hatching (12th 

 day). The lumen of the digestive tract is still full of volk-cells and 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 217 



the endoderm-cells also contain masses of yolk (?/-). Figs. 55 and 56, 

 endoderm-cells containing large masses of yolk, were taken from the 

 same embryo as Fig. 53. Fig. 57 shows a similar endoderm-cell from 

 a young planarian one day old. This cell contains one of the large 

 vacuoles (v) characteristic of adult endoderm-cells, and the yolk is 

 much disintegrated. 



Thus it is perfectly plain, in this form at least, that the yolk-cells do 

 not serve as a ''vicarious endoderm" (Metschnikoff); b\it endoderm- 

 cells, developed from the embryonic cells of the one germ layer, con- 

 sume the yolk-cells in the same manner as thej- do other food material 

 later on. 



Fig. 5-1 is a section from the head region of the same embryo as fig. 53, 

 showing brain (6) and e3Ts (e). By the fourth day after birth the yolk 

 has all disappeared from the lumen of the gut, but masses of it are still 

 to be seen in the endoderm-cells. The late embryos and young pla- 

 narians contain a very large proportion of embryonic cells and few 

 muscle- and gland-cells compared with mature animals. The tissue 

 of the whole body resembles that of recently regenerated parts of 

 adult planarians. It is interesting to note that the interval between 

 egg-laying and the development of the permanent phar\-nx, eyes and 

 nervous sj'stem in the embryo is about the same as between merotomy 

 and regeneration of the same organs in pieces of adult planarians. 



The reproductive organs develop late, and as yet have been studied 

 in only two specimens. In one young planarian, S weeks old, one ovary 

 was found, but no other reproductive or genital organs. In another, 

 10 weeks old, there was a small antrum with the penis just forming, 

 but no genital pore; one ovary and three testes were found. The 

 oocytes in these young ovaries were small and only just distinguishable 

 from the cells of the yoke glands, which were quite well developed. 

 In the testes there were already mature spermatozoa. 



Summary. 



The points that seem to need especial emphasis are : 



1. In Planaria sivipUssima division of the chromosomes in both 

 maturation-divisions is longitudinl. 



2. The number of chromosomes in the maturation-divisions of the 

 germ-cells varies frrom 3 to 6, but is usually 3. 



3. In the embryological development there is nothing corresponding 

 to the typical blastula and gastrula. After several segmentation 

 divisions the blastomcres form an irregular group embedded in a syn- 

 citial yolk-mass which forms a part of the embryo. Some of the blasto- 




218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



meres form the embryonic pharjmx; others wander through the sjii- 

 citium. 



4. The embryonic layer which covers the secondary yolk {y^) taken 

 in by the embryonic pharj-nx, in no way corresponds to the ordinary 

 gastrula-stage. The solid embryo has, by sucking in yolk through its 

 pharjmx, become a hollow ball filled with secondary yoke-cells {if). 

 The embryo now consists of a single layer of syncitial yolk-material, 

 containing scattered blastomeres which feed on the primary yolk- 

 material and multiph' luifil they occupy the whole space previously 

 filled by the primary yolk (figs. 43-46). Then the inner embryonic 

 cells begin to serve as endoderm-cells to absorb the secondary yolk. 



5. The axial gut and its principal branches are formed by ingrowths 

 from the embryonic layer, dividing up the central space which is filled 

 with secondary yolk {if). 



6. Ectoderm, endoderm, permanent pharynx, eyes, nervous system, 

 reproductive organs, gland- and muscle-cells are all formed by direct 

 differentiation of the embryonic cells of the one embryonic or germ- 

 layer. There is no formation of two or three distinct germ layers, 

 nor are any of the organs formed by folding as in most other forms.

 jaws. Eye circular, close to upper profile, and anterior in head. 

 Mouth small, a little oblique, and jaws about even. Lips rather fleshy. 

 Maxillary small, barely reaching beyond posterior nostril or to front 

 rim of orbit, and more or less concealed. Pharyngeal teeth 2, 4-4, 2, 

 and larger ones a little hooked. Nostrils large, adjoining, near upper 

 front of orbit, and frenum between forming a small flap over front of 

 posterior which is a httle larger. 



Gill-opening extending forward within a short distance of posterior 

 margin of orbit. Rakers few, weak, and small. Filaments well 

 developed, also pseudobranchise. 



Scales large, not with exposed edges narrowly imbricated, those in 

 front of dorsal smaller and somewhat crowded in appearance. A few

This form differs from Notropis chalybceus (Cope) of the Delaware 

 in its more dusky and deeper coloration. The lateral longitudinal 

 band is also broader throughout its course, the pectoral more dusky, 

 and the dusky dots which are collected along the base of the anal extend 

 along the lower surface of the caudal peduncle to the caudal. This 

 is true of all the Batsto minnows. All of those from the Delaware com- 

 prise a large series which I collected in lat-e spring and early summer, dur- 

 ing 1899, in a small stream flowing into the upper end of the mill-pond " 

 at Bristol, Bucks Coimty, Pennsylvania. These have the lateral band 

 distinctly narrower. As yet I have not taken Notropis chalybceus in 

 any other part of the Delaware basin.

NOTES ON FISHES FROM ARKANSAS, INDIAN TERRITORY AND TEXAS. 

 BY HENRY W. FOA^TiER. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, while in the above-named locahties during 

 April of 1903, formed a small collection of fishes now in the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



The more precise locahties are : 



1. Arkansas: 



Rogers, White river basin. 

 Hartford, Arkansas river basin. 



2. Indian Territory: 



Wister, Arkansas river basin. 

 Limestone Gap, Red river basin. 



3. Texas: 



Hondo, Neuces river basin. 

 Del Rio, Rio Grande basin. 

 Devil's river, Rio Grande basin. 

 One form appears to be new, and the color-notes of others are 

 especially interesting on account of the season.

in lateral line to base of caudal; 7 scales obliquely from origin of dorsal 



to lateral line, and 6 from latter to origin of ventral; 17 scales before 



dorsal; width of head H in its length; depth of head 1^; snout 3; 



eye 5^; width of mouth 5f ; interorbital space 2f ; first developed 



dorsal ray li; anal ray 1^; pectoral 1^; ventral 1^^; least depth of

caudal peduncle 1|. Opercle with radiating parallel striae. Gill-rakers 

 fine, slender, numerous, shorter than filaments. Color when fresh 

 in alcohol dull ohvaceous-brown on upper surface, pale on sides, and 

 dilute or whitish on lower surface. Every^vhere with more or less 

 dull brassy reflections. Longitudinal lines following courses of scales 

 pale. Opercle bright brassy. Fins dilute olive-yellow, unpaired 

 darker and slightly dusky marginally. Cheek silvery. Iris dull 

 golden, dusky above. Peritoneum black. Length 12^ inches. Del 

 Rio, Texas. 



Also three others with same data showing following; — Head 4i 

 to 4i; depth 2| to 3i; D. iii, 22 to 25; scales to base of caudal 35 to 

 36; total length 7^ to 8f inches. 



These all appear to me to agree best with Cope's description. He 

 gives the orbit as 4 in head, but this is probably due to a different 

 method of measuring. If the figure of Ictiohus tumidus^ is correct it 

 may represent a distinct form. The pectoral is said to almost reach 

 the ventral, and the radii are more numerous. Girard's figure of 

 Carpiodes damalis^ shows a smooth opercle, large subopercle, and the 

 ventral inserted well posterior to the tip of pectoral. In my examples 

 of C. grayi the first developed dorsal ray extends back about f of the 

 entire length of the depressed fin. 



Catostomus nigricans (Le Sueur). 



Color when fresh in alcohol dull olive, incHning to whitish below, 

 and everywhere with more or less silvery reflections. Back with five 

 rather indistinctly defined large saddle-hke blotches composed of dusky 

 points. Lower surface of head silvery. Dusky dots on side of snout, 

 maxillary and upper opercle. Dorsal and caudal dull scarlet, margins 

 more or less dusky, especially that of former. Anal, pectoral and 

 ventral whitish. Hartford, Arkansas,

PARANOTROPIS subg. nov. 

 Type Photogenis luciodus Cope 



The species of this group closely resemble those of the subgenus 

 Notropis Rafinesque, which is typified by atherinoides. They differ 

 chiefly in the fewer developed anal rays, mostly 7 to 9. They are 

 also distinguished from the Luxilus and HydropMox groups by the 

 absence of grinding surfaces on the teeth and the broad scales which 

 are not narrowly imbricated. From Orcella, with which they agree 

 in these respects, they differ in the top of the head which is not espe- 

 cially elevated, so that the eye is nearer the upper than the lower profile, 

 Episema Jordan, based on scabriceps, is preoccupied.

 more or less orange-red on fins and show greater portion of caudal 

 dusky. 



An example from Hartford, Arkansas, according to Dr. Pilsbry's

A STUDY OF THE BATS OF THE GENUS DERMONOTUS (PTERONOTUS Auot.). 

 BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



During the preparation of this paper a series of thirty-six specimens 

 of the genvis have been examined, all being from the collections of the 

 United States National Museum, the Biological Survey of the United 

 States Department of Agriculture and the American Museum of Nat- 

 m-al Histoiy. The author -wishes to express his indebtedness to the 

 gentlemen in charge of the collections of the above institutions for 

 permitting the examination of the specimens.

History. — The genus Dermonotus (Pteronotus Gray) is so closely 

 related to CMlonycteris and Mormoops that its history is in great part 

 a repetition of that witnessed in these two genera. As coiisiderable 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 251 



space has already been given to the taxonomic liistoiy of Mormoops^ 

 and Chilomjcteris ,^ only such pomts as differ will be noticed. The 

 genus was originally based on a specimen from Trinidad, and associated 

 by Gray with the following genera: Cheiromeles, Nydinomus, Molossus, 

 Thyroptera, Myopteris and Diclidurus. Wagner, in 1843, described 

 a specimen of this genus, taken by Natterer at Cuyaba, Brazil, as 

 Chilonycteris gymnonotus, unaware that Gray had created a genus for 

 this type of bat. Later, in 1855, he apparently did not recognize his 

 species as a close relative of Gray's Pteronotus davyi, as he associated 

 the latter, which he, of course, had never seen, with Cheiromeles and 

 Dysopes in the section Macrura. The question as to the tenability of 

 the genus as distinct from Chilonycteris later caused a great amount of 

 shifting, the individual opinions of Peters, Dobson, Alston, and Thomas 

 differing as to the recognition of the genus. In 1892 Thomas de- 

 scribed a race of davyi from Jalisco, IMexico, basing it on the brilliant 

 fulvous coloration of the ^Mexican specimens, and their slightly smaller 

 size. Gill, in 1901, discovered the fact that Gray's Pteronotus was 

 preoccupied by Pteronotus Rafinesque, a synonym of Ptei'opus, and to 

 meet the deficiency he proposed the name Dermonotus. 



General Relations. — The genus Dermonotus is closely associated 

 with Mormoops and Chilonycteris, which constitute the subfamily 

 Mormoopince. The characters of the genus are such that recent 

 workers have all accorded it full generic rank, and as Gill has stated 

 {I.e.), modem systematic standards would fully allow the maintenance 

 of the genus as distinct from Chilonycteris. An interesting character 

 noted in this genus, as in the two allied genera, is the occurrence of 

 dichromatism. The two phases are quite marked, one being dull 

 <?hocolate-bro\^^l, the other rich fulvous.

Type Locality. — Trinidad. 



Distribution. — Brazil; Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, and Trinidad and 

 Dominica in the West Indies, 



General Characters. — .Size medium ; character of the volar membranes 

 as described under the genus. 



Head. — Occiput dome-shaped and evenlj- rounded; rostrum rather 

 depressed, broad. Ear rather elongate, acuminate; internal margin 

 with the internal ridge very distinctly developed and forming a rounded 

 lobe inferiorly, superiorly with a blunt but distinct shoulder, beyond 

 which infra-median point the internal margin is evenly arcuate, curving 

 back to the recurved and very bluntly falcate apex; external margin 

 carried forward inferiorly to the angle of the mouth, external shoulder 

 rounded and median in position, superior portion of the external mar- 

 gin straight except for a marked concavity caused by the recurved 

 apex. Tragus subrectangulate, apical portion narrower than the basal 

 half; external margin sinuate; apex rounded; accessory lobe rather 

 small, subhorizontal, rounded, forming a distinct shoulder or ledge; 

 internal margin inferior to the accessory lobe, sinuate and with a dis- 

 tinct marginal thickening. Nostrils surrounded by a very slight raised 

 margin, and surmounted by a fleshy ridge, which is considerably ex- 

 cavated in the area superior to the nasal division ; lateral portions of 

 muzzle with a raised fleshy ridge, which is separated from the nose- 

 pad by a rather deep incision. Superior portion of the muzzle with a 

 median rounded swelling situated a short distance back from the nos- 

 trils. Labial chin-lappet strongly transverse, the lateral portions 

 rather inconspicuous and merging into the lip proper, median portion 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



distinctlj^ papillose, the papillae bordering the arched incision separating 

 the smooth incisive pad larger than the others ; posterior chin-lappet 

 almost equal to the labial in width, thin, closely ad pressed. 



Limbs. — Forearm of medium length, very distinctly arcuate though 

 the distal portion is considerably straighter than the proximal; third 

 finger slightly more than one and one-half times the length of the fore- 

 arm. Femora, tibiae and feet rather slender; calcanea about a fourth 

 as long again as the tibiae. 



Membranes and Fur. — Membranes rather thin, but very tough and 

 leathery; propatagium deep, extending free to the thumb; endopata- 

 gium and mesopatagium with the longitudinal nerves very regularly 

 and completely distributed, endopatagium attached along the median 

 line of the body by a thin membrane, otherwise free except that ante- 

 riorly it is squarely attached across the shoulders and posteriorly it 

 is tightly attached from the middle of the femur to its margin slightly 

 below the middle of the tibia; uropatagium large, the calcanea bound 

 down to the tibiae to a point opposite the attachment of the endopata- 

 gium, tail with the enclosed portion slightly exceeding the free apical 

 section. Fiu* woolly, evenly distributed over the visible and concealed 

 sections of the dorsal surface and also the entire venter; membranes 

 almost entirely covered with extremely fine short hair; muzzle and 

 lips with groups of distinctly setiform hairs. 



Color. ^ — General color vandyke-bro\^'n, membranes and ears with a 

 slight touch of blackish. It is quite probable that typical davyi will 

 be found to possess a rufous form, as two phases of coloration have been 

 found in almost all the other species and races of the Mormoopinae. 

 The distinct color phases of D. davyi fulvus are very marked, but pos- 

 sibly the more southern type possesses but one color form, or one 

 strongly predominating phase, a case of which is probably found in 

 Chilonyderis rubiginosa and rubiginosa mexicana. 



Skull. — Rather fragile ; rostrum considerably inflated and somewhat 

 depressed. Brain-case evenly arched transversely and with a slight 

 longitudinal depression, dipping suddenly toward the rostrum; zygo- 

 mata widest posteriorly and without any distinct arcuation. Rostrum 

 very distinctly inflated, the greatest width over the posterior molars; 

 nasal depression broad, smoothly excavated. Mandible rather long, 

 the ascending ramus very low and weak; coronoid and condylar pro- 

 cesses low, inconspicuous and equal in development; angle strongly 

 curved laterally and with a recurved tip.

Teeth. — Central pair of upper incisors broad with a straight, slightly 

 bilobate cutting edge ; lateral upper incisor low, in basal outhne equal 

 to the median tooth; upper canine sUghtly recurved; first upper pre- 

 molar subovate in basal outhne, the greatest length of the tooth sub- 

 longitudinal; second upper premolar subpentagonal in outline, trans- 

 verse, cusp distinct and caniniform, internal cingulum developed as a 

 distinct rim to a slightly excavated area; first and second upper 

 molars subquadrate, Avith the para-metaconoid ridges distmct and high, 

 the paracone developed as a distinct shoulder, protocone and hypocone 

 distmct, the former higher than the latter; third upper molar trans- 

 verse, para-metaconoid ridge deflected intemahy, protocone quite 

 distinct. Lower incisors obscurely tridentate, the median teeth in 

 size considerably exceeding the laterals which are crowded against 

 the canines; lower canines erect, shghth'- curved and sHghtly tapering; 

 first lower premolar subquadrate in basal outline, cusp longitudinal, 

 acute-angulate ; second lower premolar very smah, circular in basal 

 outline, crowded between the first and third premolars and deflected 

 toward the lingual side of the tooth-row ; third lower premolar rather 

 elongate-quadrate, cusp rather high, acute; molars mth the inter- 

 spaces deeply excavated, the paraconid and hypoconid lower than 

 the other cusps. 



Measurements. — Average of five Dominican specimens : Total length 

 70.8 (70-75) mm.; head and body 52.2 (51.3-53); head 18.9 (18.1- 

 19.5); ear 16 (15.5-17); tragus 4.8 (4.5-5.5); forearm 46.2 (45-48); 

 thumb 8.5 (8.1-9.1); third digit 77.4 (75-79); tibia 17.5 (17-18.1); 

 calcaneiun 21.6 (19-24); foot 11.1 (10.8-11.5); tail 20.6 (18-22). 



Average of two Dominican skulls: Total length 16.7 (16.5-17); 

 greatest zygomatic breadth 9.1 (9-9.3); interorbital width 4; height 

 at base of the second premolar 3.9 (3.8-4) ; height of brain-case 6.7 

 (6.4_7)- ■v\idth of palatal constriction 1.3; length of palate from ante- 

 rior foramina 7.1 (7-7.3) ; width of palate including teeth 6.2 (6.1-6.3) ; 

 greatest length of mandible 11.9 (11.6-12.3); breadth of brain-case 

 above roots of zygomata 8.3 (8.2-8.5). 



Remarks. — ^This form is apparently uniform in size through its range, 

 as Wagner's measurements of the type of gymnonotus (I.e.) are not ma- 

 terially different from those of the Dominican series examined. The 

 typical form can readily be distinguished from davyi fulvus by the 

 larger size and the position and less crowded character of the first 

 upper premolar.

 is strongly crowded between the canine and second premolar, and in 

 consequence is twisted so that the greatest length is almost transverse. 



Color. — BrowTi phase: Fur above vandyke-brown ; below ecru-drab, 

 the hair seal-brown basally. Membranes and ears clove-brown.

 cinnamon basally. Membranes and fur as in the rufous phase. From 

 the series examined it would appear that the individuals are equally 

 divided between the two phases.

 (7.4-8). 



Remarks. — The slightly smaller general size and the character of 

 the'first upper premolar will be found to separate this race from typical 

 davyi. The characters are, however, such that merely subspecific 

 rank should be accorded it. The range of variation in size in davyi 

 fulvus is very considerable, and does not appear to depend on sex or 

 locality.

THE LARVAL EYE OF CHITONS. 



BY HAROLD HEATH. 



In Chiton polii, according to Kowalevski, and in Ischnochiton mag- 

 dalenensis, Trachydermon raymondi and Nuttallina thomasi the eyes 

 of the larvae become clearly defined about the time of the first appear- 

 ance of the shell. They are situated immediately behind the velum, 

 half-way up the sides of the body. Concerning their structure Kowa- 

 levski wTites/ " They are characterized by the pigment deposited about 

 a central clear body, and are placed almost entirely upon the lateral 

 or branchial nerves." As the figures of this author show, each ocellus 

 at this time consists of a single cell imbedded in the epithelium covering 

 the body. In later stages this condition of affairs in the young of 

 Chiton polii becomes more complex. According to Kowalevski, 

 the pigmented body, with its clear included vesicle, retains its early 

 characters, but migrates "under the skin and upon the branchial 

 nerve. The ectodermic epithelium, situated above the eves, presents 

 certain modifications which may be related to the function of the 

 ocellus; its cells are here very slender, more elongated than those 

 adjoining, their appearance is different, and it appears to me possible 

 that these cells play a certain role in the transmission of luminous 

 rays to the ocellus and perform the function of a cornea." 



While working upon certain problems connected with the larval 

 development of chitons, I have many times noticed the ocelli in 

 several species. In those forms enumerated above, save Chiton polii, 

 I have traced these structures through all stages, from their first 

 development until their final disappearance; and after the metamor- 

 phosis of the larva have determinetl their fate in Ischnochiton tnertensii, 

 I. regularis, I. cooperi, Katharina tunicata and Tonicella lineata. In 

 its early stages in these species each eye appears essentiall}' as described 

 by Kowalevski, and this state of affairs continues as long as the ocellus 

 may be distinguished. Under no circumstances does it become 

 subepithelial. In many cases the pigmented cell sinks somewhat be- 

 neath the general outer surface of the epithelium and is partially over- 

 arched by neighboring cells, but these are in no wise different from 

 those elsewhere in the skin and never give the impression of forming

a lens or cornea. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of Kowa- 

 levski's observations, but the eye of Chiton polii is certainly not typi- 

 cal. On the other hand, the eyes of the chitons I have examined are 

 in their histological details essentially hke those of the annelid trocho- 

 phore. In the latter organism they are placed in the velar field and 

 are innervated by nerves from the cerebral ganglia; in the chitons they 

 are posttrochal and are situated on the pallial cords. These facts, 

 however, may not be fatal to the theory that the ocelH of the larvae of 

 these two phyla are homologous, especially in view of the fact that their 

 early development is almost identical, I have shown in another paper^

that the head vesicle, or the part of the chiton larva anterior to the 

 velum, ''becomes transformed into part of the first valve of the shell, 

 the mantle and mantle furrow of the same region, and into the pro- 

 boscis." Now it is obvious that if the chiton eye w^ere situated in 

 front of the velum, as in the annelids, it would be most unfavorably 

 placed after the metamorphosis. Under the circumstances the most 

 available situation would be the furrow about the proboscis, where it

would be continually obscured and would be practically useless even 

 if provided with special tentacles. It seems most reasonable to sup- 

 pose that as the structures characteristic of the chitons appeared in 

 the phylogenetic development, the eye-spots gradually shifted their 

 position into the present more favorable location. 



Pelseneer^ has made a detailed study of the larval eyes of some of 

 the Mytilidce and the related genus Avicula. They arise in the embryo 

 behind the velum and on the base of the first gill-filament. "Each 

 eye is open, that is to say, an invagination of the skin, and consists of 



pigmented epithelial cells The cavity is filled by an elongated 



crystalline body continuous with the overlying cuticle They 



have a structure intermediate between the eyes of Patella and Trochus," 

 and are innervated by fibers from the cerebral ganglia. Pelseneer con- 

 siders that this type of eye and that of the chitons are homologous. 

 This assumption must rest entirely upon the fact that both are post- 

 trochal. They certainly are fundamentally different in structure. 

 Even with Chiton polii this is the case, and, furthermore, this organ in 

 the lamellibranchs is innervated by nerves from the cerebral ganglia, 

 and in the chitons by the pallial nerves. Thiele's* contention that the 

 eye of Area nooe and the chiton eye are homologous rests upon the same 

 foundation as Pelseneer's argument. Both are behind the velum, 

 but fundamentally different structurally and in their innervation. As 

 the matter now stands, the theory that the chiton and the annelid eye 

 are homologous rests upon identity of structure ; while the chiton and 

 lamellibranch larval eye are supposed to be genetically related 

 because of similarity of position. 



It is improbable that the e3'es of chitons are functional only in the 

 larvse. In the three species studied before the metamorphosis the pig- 

 ment appears about twenty-four hours prior to the free-swimming 

 stage, which lasts from fifteen minutes to twenty-four hours, according 

 to conditions. After the metamorphosis, which ensues after the 

 embryos have settled, these sense organs in at least eight species 

 invariably persist for a considerable length of time. In fact, they 

 appear to remain as long as the shell and mantle are sufficiently trans- 

 parent to allow the light to penetrate, or until the animal is upward of 

 5 mm. in length. Some of the smaller species are at this time sexually 

 mature; while some of the larger forms are only one-fourth or even 

 one-tenth their adult size.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN ARANE^E OF THE FAMILIES 

 LYCOSID^ AND PISAURID^.i 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR. 



A very considerable number of species of spidei'S of the families 

 Lycosidse and Pisam'idse have been described from North America, 

 but for the most the descriptions have barely diagnostic worth. At 

 the present time it is practically impossible to identify most of the 

 species of Walckenaer, Blackwall, Hentz and some others, because 

 some of their species are so insufficiently described that a particular 

 description applies equally well to a number of species. By far the 

 most thorough work so far is that of Keyserling. When the American 

 species are better known than they are at present we shall be in better 

 position to identify the species named b}^ the earlier writers, for then 

 the identification can be done by the process of elimination. The 

 more deeply one enters into the closely intergrading species of the 

 Lycosidse especially, the more doubtful seems to be the character of 

 attempts to recognize poorly described forms. Nearly the whole 

 southeastern section of the United States and the greater part of the 

 region west of the Mississippi river have been untouched by modern 

 arachnologists ; with such a hiatus in the material for comparison, it 

 would be unscientific to make sure of the status of species known only 

 by inadequate diagnoses. It is right to attempt, as far as possible, 

 to recognize the species of earlier writers, but not to uphold names when 

 the type specimens are lost and when the type descriptions are not 

 decisive. When all the species are known, the trial can be undertaken 

 of determining the earlier species. 



The Lycosidae and Pisaurida? are ])articularly interesting groups 

 because of the difficulties in the way of their study. Not only do 

 the species intergrade closely, but there is very considerable individual 

 variation apart from geographical variation, and the genera are as 

 difficult to define sharply as are the •species. No groups are better 

 adapted to prove the idea that the species, as the higher groups, are but 

 concepts, and -their delimitation necessary purely for purposes of de-

scription and interpretation. \Miat is needed above all, as the pre- 

 liminary to any morphological or broad ethological study of them, 

 are full and ample descriptions of the structure — of the external geni- 

 taha, together with the form and proportions of the cephalothorax, the 

 mouth parts and the legs. The number of the teeth on the tarsal claws 

 is of no value, for it is subject to great individual variation, as has been 

 shown by my student, Mr. Carl Hartmann. The number of teeth 

 on the chelicera is of more importance, but must be used cautiously 

 and at the most as a specific character, for I have found a specimen 

 of Trochosa purcelli where one cheliceron differed in the number of 

 its teeth from the other. The number of spines on the joints of the 

 legs may not be greatly subject to individual variation, but in very 

 closely related species it may differ, as e.g., the spines of the ventral 

 surface of tibia I in Pardosa. Characters of the relative position of 

 the eyes are decidedly variable in different individuals of some species, 

 apparently constant in some others. Again, some species, particularly 

 of Trochosa and Pirata, show considerable secondary sexual structural 

 differences. And the epigyna even, perhaps the best of any single 

 structural character, are often variable in their form. 



In the present paper I give descriptions of the structure of all those 

 species seen by me, with figures of the genitaha in those cases where 

 they have not been figured before or where the figures have been badly 

 made, and descriptions of the color and dimensions only in the case of 

 new species or where preceding descriptions were not detailed. Where 

 such descriptions conflict with those of my previous papers, they are to 

 be considered as emendations of the latter. In the measurements of 

 the legs the coxse are included; and by the term "height of the head 

 in front" is meant the distance from the inferior margin of the clypeus 

 to the superior border of the eyes of the second row. Only wTiters 

 who have given descriptions are included in the synonymical list of 

 each species. All the species previously described by me are described 

 again, but in their structure much more in detail than before; also 

 all the species described by Emerton (1885), except his Lycosa nigro- 

 ventris and Pirata insularis, are described ; and in the Keys all the spe- 

 cies from the continent of North America described by Keyserling 

 (1876) are included. No species have been considered from the North 

 American continent south of the United States. With great care I 

 have gone over again the previous descriptions of all the species from 

 this region, but imfortunately the following papers were inaccessible 

 to me: Banks (1894a), Blackwall (1846, 1871), Cragin, Giebel (1869), 

 Girard (1854) and Thorell (1872). Doubtless on account of these 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 263 



missing papers some mistakes will be found to have crept into the 

 identification of certain species. 



My thanks are due to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 

 delphia, and to Mr. Witmer Stone in particular, for the loan of all of 

 their type specimens; and especially to Mr. J. H. Emerton, who not only 

 loaned me a considerable number of specimens, but also by correspond- 

 ence aided me very materially in the question of the synonymy of cer- 

 tain species: thus he pointed out the identity of his Pardosa hrunnea, 

 alhomaculata and montana with species described by Thorell; of my 

 Lycosa ocreata pulchra with his Pardosa bilineata, and of my Lycosa 

 stonei with the Lycosa ocreata of Hentz. 



In regard to the genera I have employed, I must candidly admit 

 that the deUmitation of the genera was the most difficult part of the 

 whole study. Simon (lS98o) has withdrawn both Trochosa and Pirata 

 into Lycosa, while I maintain their separateness, and this because these 

 two genera intergrade no more closely with Lycosa than does Pardosa, 

 so that if Pardosa is to be upheld, the others must likewise be. It is 

 a question of either making one large comprehensive genus, and for 

 piu"poses of description subdividing it into a number of subgenera, or 

 of recognizing as many genera. In either case the boundaries of the 

 groups, be they called subgenera or genera, are equally difficult to 

 define, A new genus, Geolycosa, is proposed for forms which differ 

 from Lycosa by the length and thickness of the first pair of legs. Par- 

 dosa is composed of rapidly running, usually or always diurnal species, 

 of small size with great length of legs and large ocular area and small 

 cheHcera; they are essentially Lycosids which have become diurnal 

 runners. Geolycosa is the very opposite, large forms with strong legs 

 and jaws fitted for digging the deep cylindrical holes in which they 

 live. Some of the species of Pirata are peculiar in forming small closed 

 nests in which they pass the winter, little cups of silks attached to the 

 under surface of stones. They are generally found close to water. 

 The species of Trochosa are nocturnal, living under stones, where they 

 apparently make no excavations. Sosipp^is, according to Simon, 

 builds a large web-sheeting. Aulonia has the habits of Pirata, and 

 is closely related to it. Lycosa is for the most part nocturnal, and 

 many of the species build shallow excavations lined with silk under 

 stones; others are, in the breeding season at least, diurnal, such as 

 scutulata and ocreata, and these are forms which approach Pardosa in 

 their structure. So we find that the structure corresponds pretty 

 closely to the habit: long legs in the diurnal species, high cephalic 

 region in the running and digging species, and low in the sedentary 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



forms which do not form holes; weak chehcera and short labium asso- 

 ciated with slender legs; large eye area is fomid in the dim-nal species, 

 while small eye area is associated with tubicolous forms and species 

 with very short legs. So the genera here defined are based upon both 

 morphological and ethological characters. 



Finally, this paper is by no means a comprehensive monograph, 

 but is intended to be a help to the one who comes later with sufficient 

 material at his disposal to make the monograph.

Genus SOSILATJS Simon, lS9So. 



I have not seen this genus, which was created by Simon for a species 

 (S. spiniger) from Louisiana. His diagnosis is: ''Cephalothorax

 obliqua atque obtusa. Oculi quatuor antici inter se subcontigui, in 

 lineam leviter recurvam, medii lateralibus saltern duplo majores.

 from each other by about four-fifths their diameter. Third eye row 

 slightly wider than the second. Length of dorsal eye area to cephalo- 

 thorax as 1 : 4.5. Quadrilateral of the posterior ej^es broader than 

 long. 



Form. — Cephalothorax in front less than one-half its greatest trans- 

 verse diameter, low and flattened above, highest just anterior to the 

 middle, its posterior declivity describing an angle of 45° wdth its dorsal 

 contour. Sides of head vertical. CheHcera with 3 pairs of teeth, 

 shorter than the width of the ctypeus, their length about 1.5 times 

 the height of the head in front. Posterior spinnerets about 1.5 times 

 as long as the anterior, with the terminal joint longer than wide. 

 Labium about as broad as long, rounded apically. Metatarsus IX 

 shorter than patella and tibia combined. Length of leg IV to cephalo- 

 thorax ( 9 ) as 3.4 : 1. The first two eye rows project forward beyond

Genus PARDOSA C. Koch, 1848. 



The main distinguishing characters of this genus are those men- 

 tioned in the Key, namely: Metatarsus IV longer than patella 

 and tibia combined; eyes of the second row at least 1.5 times their 

 diameter apart ; sides of the head more or less vertical ; chehcera weak 

 and nearly straight in front (their length not more than one and 

 three-fifths times the height of the head in front, with 3 pairs of teeth) ; 

 and the dorsal ej^e area quite or almost one-quarter the length of the 

 cephalothorax. Further, the cephalothorax is always highest at the 

 posterior eyes, and in front not more than one-half its greatest trans- 

 verse diameter; and the legs are long and slender with long spines, 

 the fourth leg never less than 4.2 times the length of the cephalothorax, 

 and very frequently the legs are proportionatelj^ longer in the females 

 than in the males (the reverse being the case in the other genera). The 

 labium is small, not one-half the length of the maxillae, and usualh' 

 not longer than wide (except in mercurialis, glacialis and groenlandica) . 

 The posterior spinnerets are longer than the anterior, and the first eye 

 row always shorter than the second. The d^ palpal organ is usuall}^ 

 very large. Tibia I has either 3 or 4 pairs of ventral spines. 



The relationships of the genus are with Trahce'a and Lycosa.

 Sternum clear j-ellow, or suffused with black on its anterior half. 

 Abdomen above deep black or brown. In light individuals there is a 

 median yellow band, broadest anteriorly, extending the whole length 

 of the dorsum, bordered anteriorly by four pairs of small black dots, 

 and posteriori}" banded by transverse lines of yellow wider than the

 deep black and the forehead yellow. A median yellow band arises 

 narrowly between the third eyes, shortly behind enlarges to a diam- 

 eter somewhat less than the distance between these eyes, narrows again 

 in front of the dorsal groove, enlarges again verj' shghtly around thi;^ 

 groove, and then passes back, becoming narrower, to the posterior end 

 of the thorax. Medio-posteriorly from each eye of the third row a short 

 bro\\'n line obliquely incises the median band. The median band is 

 bordered on each side bj^ a broader brown band transversed by radial 

 lines of black. On each side is a broad submarginal yellow band, 

 narrower than the contiguous brown band, which joins with its fellow 

 of the opposite side Ijelow the anterior eyes. Sternum yellow like the 

 coxae, sometimes with indistinct darker marginal markings. Abdomen

median band is not enclosed by a broader yellow one, and behind it is 

 either a silvery (or yellowish) band with scalloped margins extending 

 back to the spinnerets, or else a series of contiguous spots of one of 

 these colors, each containing a pair of minute black dots. The median 

 light area of the dorsum is bordered on each side by a broader black 

 band, mottled with yellowish. The sides are gray or yellowish, 

 streaked with black. Venter grayish-yellow, spinnerets clear yellow,

Comparison. — This species is most closely related to nigropalpis. 

 The d^ of minima can be readily distinguished from that of nigropalpis 

 in having the palpal patella entirely white instead of deep black, in 

 the different coloration of the legs, and in the difference in size of the 

 eye area. But the females of the two are much more difficult to dis- 

 tinguish, and there is no good structural difference in the structure of 

 the epigyna. In the $ of minima it is the usual case that the palpal pa- 

 tella has no dark spots below (they are usually present in nigropalpis) ; 

 the sternum is brown (never deep black) with a yellow median line 

 anteriorly and a broader black one posteriorly and with some black on 

 the margins (in nigropalpis in the majority of specimens deep black 

 with a yellow median line anteriorly) ; the femora below usually yellow 

 18

spotted with black (in nigropalpis usually blackish) ; finally the cepha- 

 lothoracal median yellow band usually encloses a broad reddish-brown 

 area at its anterior end (usually not so in nigropalpis). Of all these 

 differences the only one that appears to be constant is the fii'st. Min- 

 ima averages smaller in size, but then nigropalpis is very variable in 

 this respect; and nigropalpis has generally the dark annulations on 

 the legs much more distinct, but some individuals of minima from 

 "Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, have the logs just as distinctly banded.

Genus SOSIPPTJS Simon, 1888. ' 



The North American species of this genus described by Simon (S. 

 floridanus) has not been seen by me. The posterior spinnerets are 

 longer than the anterior, with the apical joint as long or almost as 

 long as the basal and garnished with fusules on its inner surface; the 

 labium is longer than wide and quite one-half the length of the maxillae; 

 the posterior margin of the chelicera has 4 teeth. The face is vertical 

 only in the plane of the anterior eyes. The legs are long, the anterior 

 tarsi and metatarsi usually scopulated, metatarsus IV as long as the 

 patella and tibia combined. First row of eyes broader than the second, 

 the lateral eyes as large or larger than the middle ones. The integu- 

 ment is covered with plumed hairs. The sides of the head are nearh' 

 vertical. 



Evidently this genus is most closely allied to Pirata. They spin a 

 large web hke that of an Agalenn. 



Genus LYCOSA Latreille, 1804 (ad partem). 



I have followed Simon (189S) in defining this genus, except that I 

 have excluded from it Pirata and Trochosa. 



The main characters are the f ollowdng : The cephalothorax is highest 

 in the cephalic portion (except in the 6^ of charonoides) , and the sides 

 of the head usually only moderately obUque; the first eye row is 

 shorter than the second (except in inhonesta and in the d^ of charo- 

 noides) ; the eyes of the second row are never separated by more than 

 1.5 times their diameter; the chehcera are robust and their length is 

 usually quite twice the height of the head in front (except in the Pardo- 

 soid species bilineata, relucens and ocreata) ; the posterior spinnerets 

 are shorter, or but Httle longer, than the anterior {antelucana, mccooki, 

 scutulata) ; tibia I has 3 pairs of ventral spines ; the labium is shorter 

 than one-half the length of the maxillae, but longer than wide (except 

 in hilineata and scutulata) ; metatarsus IV is shorter than the patella 

 and tibia combined (except in the c? of scutulata, ayitehicana and 

 ocreata). The length of the dorsal eye area to the cephalothorax 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 277 



Varies from 1 : 4.5 to 1 : 7. The length of leg IV to the cephalotho- 

 rax from 2.7 : 1 to 4.7 : 1. The legs are usually well seopulated. 



Lycosa intergrades very closely with Pardosa, and the species 

 hilineata, relucens, ocreata and scutulata are quite intermediate. The 

 relationship with Trochosa is equally close. More remote are the rela- 

 tions to Pirata, yet P. elegans has a number of Lycosoid characters.

Color (in alcohol). — Cephalothorax with a broad median buff band 

 arising at the posterior eyes and extending back (becoming gradually 

 broader) to just in front of the middle of the dorsum where it is as 

 broad as the eye area; just in front of the dorsal groove it is deeply 

 incised laterally, it expands around this groove (where it is broadest), 

 it is notched behind the groove and from there continues back as a 

 narrower band; this band usually contains two pairs of minute black 

 spots in its anterior third. On each side of this median band is a deep 

 brown or blackish band, in its middle wider than the median band and 

 with lobed lateral margins; the i)osterior sides of the median band are 

 edged with deep black. Each cheek has a buff submarginal mark, and 

 the sides of the thorax have large submarginal marks of the same color 

 and of irregular shape, separated by lines of blackish radiating from the 

 dorsal groove. The anterior eye area is black; the extreme margin of 




280 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



the thorax blackish. Sternum yellowish or reddish-browii, darker than 

 the coxae. Abdomen above deep bro^\Ti or reddish-browii, on its an- 

 terior half a slightly darker median band which is widest at its anterior 

 end, has a pair of short lateral diverticula at its middle, and terminates 

 posteriorly in a transverse arc. On the posterior dorsum is a series 

 of four transverse arches, which become posteriorly successively smaller, 

 each in its anterior portion of the same color as the median band, 

 but posteriorly narrowly edged T\nth whitish. At each antero-lateral 

 margin of the dorsum is a black mark of a U-shape, with the bend of 

 the U directed medio-anteriorly, and on a Hue with each of these marks 

 a row of foiu- to six black spots which extend on each side of the dorsum 

 back to the spinnerets; the first two of these spots are largest and 

 always the most conspicuous, and sometimes all the spots of one line 

 are connected so as to form a broken, longitudinal black line. The 

 sides are deep browni mottled with spots of the same color as the me- 

 dian band. The venter has a band of yellowish extending from the epi- 

 gastric slit to the spinnerets, which is in front almost as broad as the 

 lung area but behind becomes slightly narrower; within this light 

 band are two parallel longitudinal rows of small blackish spots, most 

 distinct on the anterior half of the venter, and never extending back 

 quite as far as the spinnerets. Epigynum deep reddish-browm. Spin- 

 nerets chocolate-brown. Chelicera deep reddish-bro^\^l or black, with 

 black and white hairs, the macula pale red ; maxillce and lahium lighter 

 ■with yellowish tips. Legs distinctly banded above, less distinctly 

 below, with black and buff on the femora, patellae blackish proximally 

 and buff distally, tibiae blackish at the ends and buff at the middle, 

 tarsi and metatarsi blackish.

 dentated, and behind this groove terminating very narrow. There is 

 a broad, interrupted submarginal band of the same color on each side. 

 Sternum deep reddish-brown like the ventral surface of the coxae. 

 Abdomen above with a large black spot at the anterior end on each side 

 of the mid-Hne, and from each of these spots a blackish, interrupted 

 band passes back along the margin of the dorsum almost to the spin- 

 nerets ; in the mid-line a series of five triangular and contiguous black 

 markings, decreasing in size posteriorly, and the most anterior placed 

 just anterior to the middle ; the remainder of the dorsum is pm-plish- 

 gray with minute black spots. The sides are finely mottled with pur- 

 ple-gray and brown ; the whole venter black spotted laterally with 

 brown, lung-books orange, epigynum deep reddish-brown, spinnerets 

 brown. Chelicera black, labium and maxillce the same but with light 

 tips. Legs above and below distinctly annulated on all joints with 

 black and yellowish. Palpi colored like the legs.

 the exception of the lung-books) ; and that the abdominal dorsum has 

 on each margin a broad band of black extending its entire length, the 

 area betw'een these brands being gray with transverse lines of black 

 in its posterior half.

Comparisons. — This species comes closest to L. euepigynata, but 

 differs from it in slightly shorter relative length of legs, in greater rela- 

 tive width of cephalothorax (in insopita less than one-quarter longer 

 than broad, in euepigynata decidedly more than one-quarter), in the 

 dark coloration of the venter, and in the structure of the genitaUa. 

 It differs also from L. purcelli, the epigynum of which is very similar, 

 in the shghtly greater relative length of the legs, in greater size, and 

 markedly in the coloration. 



Hahits.— Less abundant than the preceding, and found in drier

 much more distinct on the ventral surface, ^'entral surface of the 

 coxae brownish-yellow or deep black. 



One female (the largest obtained) differed in coloration as follows: 

 Cephalothorax chocolate-brown with the cheeks pale buff, this buff 

 extending back as a narrow submarginal band to about the end of the 

 anterior third of the cephalothorax. and succeeded by three to four 

 indistinct buff spots. 



Color of Males (in alcohol). — Differ from the females in that the 

 median stripe on the abdominal dorsum is much more distinct, and 

 with a buff band contiguous to each side of it. Sternum, labium, 

 maxillse and inferior surface of coxae chocolate-brown. 



Comparisons. — This species comes closest to L. inhonesta (Keys.), 

 from which it differs: (1) In the first row of eyes being upon the 

 clypeal margin; (2) in the head being relatively lower at the second 

 row of eyes; (3) in the head of the female being rounded in front; 

 (4) in the color of the abdominal dorsum; and (5) to some extent in 

 the genitalia. 



Habits. — Under stones, common in the autumn, but none found in 

 tho winter.

Color (in alcohol). — Cephalothorax hrovm. or blackish, white between 

 the eyes of the second row and a white line below each of these eyes. 

 A median buff or reddish-browm band, almost as broad as the eye area, 

 extends from the eye region along the whole length of the cephalothorax 

 and is slightly constricted anterior to the dorsal groove. There is a 

 narrow, undulating, buff submarginal band, and the extreme margin is 

 black. Sternum hrovm or black, darker than the coxae. Abdomen with- 

 out a median band, a large wliitish or pale yellow spot covers almost 

 the anterior third of the dorsum, and behind it on the dorsum are 

 .5-6 pairs of smaller spots of the same color, the posterior ones appear- 

 ing as transverse stripes due to the confluence of their component 

 spots ; each row of these light markings is bordered lateralh- by a broad 

 black stripe. Sides mottled •v\-ith black or gray, ^'enter black in one 

 specimen, mottled black and yellowish in the other. Epigynum yellow. 

 Chelicera deep reddish-black, labium the same color with yellowish tip,

onds and narrowly edged with blackish; to each side of the mid-line 

 is a row of about 6 small spots, the posterior ones connected by narrow 

 transverse lines of the same color. The sides are greenish-brown, 

 flecked ventrally with yellow, ^^nter yellow with a median and a pair 

 of closely approximated lateral blackish, longitudinal bands which 

 converge as they pass caudad, but are separated from the spinnerets 

 by an area of the same color as the sides; the lateral dark bands 

 diverge around the epigpium and at some distance from it, but unite 

 anteriorly close to the pedimcle. Chelicera dark reddish-black with 

 few hairs, labium the same color with yellow tip, maxillce brownish. 

 Legs wdth the femora black (except for a yellow spot#on the distal 

 anterior surface of the first pair) ; coxae and trochanters blackish above 

 but lighter below; the other joints light yellow, patellae and tibiae of 

 the first three pairs blackish below, fourth pair with the patella blackish 

 IdcIow and the tibia with a blackish ring at each end and extending to 

 the dorsal surface. Palpi with femora black, other joints yellow with 

 some blackish ventrally. 



Color of Male (in alcohol).— Ccphalothorax hairless, shining dark 

 browni, a black stripe between the second and third eyes of each side. 

 Sternum shining brown. Abdomen above with the median band bor- 

 dered with small black dots, and enclosed in a broader bright yellow 

 area w^hich in its posterior two-thirds contains on each side a row of 

 about 7 small black spots, each row^ more lateral than the median band, 

 and the tW'O rows meeting at the spinnerets. The sides are blackish, 

 flecked with yellow. The venter is like that of the female, but the 

 median dark band is lacking. Legs with femora darkest, these being 

 greenish-brown, as are the trochanters; coxae yellow proximally; the 

 other joints pale yellow without dark markings. Palpi greenish, the 

 ventral surface of the patella and the. distal end of the tarsus yelloAv. 



Comparisons. — ^This species is to be distinguished from L. rvgosa 

 (Keys.), another small species with hairless cephalothorax, in the 

 structure of the palpal organ ; in the wide separation of the eyes of the 

 second row; in the chelicera being considerable" longer than the first 

 patellae and arched in front; and in the different color of the abdominal 

 venter. Hentz's L. funerea may be one of these species, but his de- 

 scription and figure gives so insufficient a diagnosis that it is doubtful 

 whether funerea can ever be recognized with certainty.

 sUghtly rounded and about one-half its greatest transverse diameter.

Remarks. — ^The Texas specimens offer as great variation in size and 

 color as do the northern ones (cf. Montgomery, 1903). Under stones 

 in the bed of Shoal Creek, at Austin, where they are very numerous, 

 two series of individuals may be distinguished : 



(1) Smaller ones of hghter color. Cephalothorax with the hght 

 submarginal band as distinct as the median. Abdomen above with a 

 pale brown to orange median band extending the whole length of the 

 dorsum, and enclosing in its anterior half a narrower darker band 

 edged with black; each side of the dorsum is darker with a row of 

 whitish spots that are frequently connected by transverse white lines; 

 venter pale brown, imspotted or with small spots. Sternum and coxse 

 darker brown to reddish-browm. Legs greenish or yellowish with 

 darker annulations. Cephalothoracal length (9 ) 7.5-8.5 mm. 



(2) Larger ones of darker color. Cephalothorax with the submar- 

 ginal bands frequently interrupted or indistinct. Abdomen very dark 

 above and with the pattern indistinct; venter frequently blackish, 

 with numerous small black spots which are sometimes arranged in 

 longitudinal rows; rarely the entire venter is deep black. Sternum 

 and inferior surface of coxse reddish-brown to deep black. Legs dark 

 broTNTi T\dth more or less distinct darker annulations ; leg IV sometimes 

 shows on the inferior surface deep black rings at both ends of the 

 tibia and at the distal end of the tarsus, Cephalothoracal length ( $ ) 

 8.5-1L5 mm. 



The intermediates between these two groups are not very numerous. 

 The most constant color diagnostic is the very narrovv^ light median 

 band of the cephalothorax. 



This species is so variable that without a large series of individuals 

 one might easily conclude that it included two species, namely, a 

 smaller one (niclicola of Emerton) and a larger and darker one, with 

 distinct annulations on the legs {inhonesta of Keyserling, tigrina of 

 McCook). But there are no valid distinctions in the genitalia of the 




292 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



two, and they intergrade in size and color, so that I have conckided to 



regard them as one species. It is possible that Emerton's vulpina is a 



color variety of this species; but of vulpina I have seen only an adult 



male (labelleitl so by Mr. Emerton), and no adult female, so that I could 



not decide the point. 



Habits. — This is a species of moist ground and meadow land, and 



at Austin is very abundant under stones on the margin of Shoal Creek. 



The males and the young are more or less diurnal, the grown females 



nocturnal. 



Lycosa relucens Montg. 



Lycosa relucens Montgomery, 1902, 

 Lycosa verisimilis Montgomery, 1902, 1903. 



(Specimens from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Austin, Texas.) 



Eyes. — First row straight, narrower than the second, nearer to the 

 clypeal margin than to the second row, eyes adequal in size. Eyes of 

 second row largest, about 1.5 times their diameter apart. Length of 

 the dorsal eye area to the cephalothorax, cJ 1 : 4.5, $1:5. Quadri- 

 lateral of the posterior eyes broader than long. 



Form. — Cephalothorax highest at the posterior eyes, in front trun- 

 cated and not one-half its greatest transverse diameter, sides of the 

 head nearly vertical (cJ^) or more obhque ( 9 ), anterior margin of the 

 head projecting slightly in front of the clypeus. Chelicera with 3 pairs 

 of teeth, longer than the width of the clypeus, their length about twice 

 the height of the head in front. Lal)ium longer than broad, apically 

 rounded ( 9 ) or truncated {(j), not one-half the length of the maxillae. 

 Sternum large, longer than broad. Length of leg IV to cephalothorax 

 as 4 : 1, metatarsus IV shorter than the patella and tibia combined. 

 Spinnerets equal in length. 9 palpal claw with 3 teeth. 



Remarks. — The very considerable variation in the form of the epi- 

 gynum led me originally to divide this into two species. Recently I 

 have obtained individuals wdth the epigynum quite intermediate in 

 structure between the extremes first found. The specimens from Texas 

 are larger than the northern ones. 



GEOLYCOSA nov. gen. 



I propose this new genus for those species, previously included in 

 Lycosa, in which the first leg is thickest and strongest, furnished with 

 thick scopulse on its three terminal joints, and almost as long as the 

 fourth (shorter by not more than one-half the length of tarsus I). 

 Geolycosa latifrons is the type species. 



In Geolycosa latifrons the cephalothorax is very high in the cephalic 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 293 



portion, and from that point to its posterior margin its dorsal contoiu' 

 is almost straight without an}- demarcation of a posterior declivity ; the 

 posterior declivity is only slightly marked in arenicola and carolinensis^ 

 but well marked in baltimoriana and texana. In latifrons also the che- 

 licera are very large and thick. The first row of eyes is about as broad 

 as the second, except in texana. The other characters are essentially 

 those of Lycosa. 



This genus is better demarcated from Lycosa than either Pardosa 

 or Trochosa. All the species dig deep cyhndrical holes in the ground, 

 and some of them build a low turret of sticks around the aperture 

 {arenicola, latifrons, texana). This burrowing habit has Qccasioned the 

 thickness of the first pair of legs, and occasioned also the height of the 

 cephalothorax in front b}'- the greater development of the muscles there. 

 Lycosa fatifera Hentz probably belongs to this genus, but Hentz's very 

 brief description: "Bluish black; cephalothorax deeper in color at the 

 sides ; chelicera covered with rufous hairs and with a red elevation on 

 their external side near the base; one of the largest species," is insuffi- 

 cient. He states it "is common in Massachusetts," and this, together 

 with his description of its tube, makes it possible that he had either a 

 light variety of carolinensis or an unusually large and dark specimen 

 of arenicola.

Color in Life. — Cephalothorax above grayish-black, with a grayish 

 median band that occupies the whole siu"face between the eyes of the 

 second and third rows, passes back to almost the middle of the cephalo- 

 thorax, there becomes narrower and continues to the posterior margin. 

 Extreme margin black. There is an interrupted submarginal gray 

 band which is continued on to the cephalic portion. All the gray 

 markings are due to long whitish hairs, and finer whitish hairs are scat- 

 tered over the blackish regions. Sternum thickly covered with long, 

 stiff, grayish hairs, sometimes black on the margins. Abdomen above 

 on its anterior half with a median band of dark brownish edged nar- 

 rowly with black and containing minute black spots ; this band termi- 

 nates truncated about the middle of the dorsum, and on each side of it 

 at about its middle is a pointed black spot. This band hes in a less 

 distinctly defined, broader pale brownish band which extends the whole 

 length of the dorsum and becomes much narrower toward the spinnerets. 

 In this broader band, behind the narrower enclosed darker one, are 

 about 6-7 crescentic transverse markings each as wide as the broad

band, each black anteriorly and white posteriorly, the most anterior 

 being the most distinct ; at each end of each of these crescentic mark- 

 ings is a large pale gray spot. Sides above dappled gray and blackish, 

 below with larger black spots scattered on a gray or yellow ground. 

 Venter in front of epigynum gray or yellow with a single pair of black 

 spots. Just behind the rima epigastrica is a broad, transverse black 

 band the anterior edge of which is straight and sharply demarcated, 

 but the posterior edge of which is extended backward as a more or less 

 interrupted median black band extending to a little in front of the 

 spinnerets, and a pair of lateral black bands (or row^s of black spots) 

 which curve backward to meet the median band just in front of the 

 spinnerets ; thus the venter appears to possess a pair of elongate yellow 

 or yellowdsh-gray areas, separated by the median black band, bordered 

 laterally and posteriorly by the lateral black lines, and anteriorly by 

 the transverse black band. Spinnerets blackish. Chelicera anteriorly 

 with orange and black hairs, the macula red; maxillce reddish-brown, 

 labium darker. Legs above gra^dsh vnih. one or two black spots on the 

 coxae and black longitudinal markings on the posterior aspect of the 

 femora; below each coxa is whitish, sometimes with a longitudinal 

 black stripe, each femur whitish with a black ring at its distal end, 

 each patella whitish, the first tibia blackish its entire length, the tibiae 

 of the other pairs whitish in the middle and black at the ends, the tarsi 

 and metatarsi black. Palpi gra5nsh, unmarked except that the ter- 

 minal joint is black on the inferior surface. 



Comparisons. — This large and beautiful species is quite distinct from 

 any other. It is very abundant in open areas of the limestone region of 

 Austin, and lives in deep cylindrical holes lined with silk, and T\dth 

 the opening of the tube raised above the surface of the ground, as in 

 G. arenicola.

end, the posterior declivity not being separable from the dorsal outHne. 

 It is very high at the posterior eyes, and the cephalic portion is marked 

 off from the thoracal on each side by a groove ; the sides of the head are 

 obhque and the cheeks very broad. Chehcera massive with a large 

 macula basalis, T^dth three pairs of teeth, longer than clj^aeus ^^•ide, in 

 length about 2.5 times the height of the head from the clypeal margin

 num much longer than broad. Labium longer than wide, not one-half 

 the length of the maxillae, apically concave. Posterior spinnerets 

 longest. Epigjmum very large. First leg noticeably thicker than the 

 others, particularly its three terminal joints which are thickly covered

Color of Females (in alcohol). — Cephalothorax -with few and only short 

 hairs; clear to dark reddish-brown in the cephaHc portion, this clear 

 area constricting anterior to the dorsal groove, then enlarging again 

 around this groove ; sides darker, interrupted by reddish bands radiat- 

 ing from the dorsal groove, the extreme margin black. Sternum yellow 

 to yellowish-gray. Abdomen above dull browoi to chocolate-brown 

 without any distinct pattern on the dorsum; at each antero-lateral 

 angle a large elongate black spot ; sides behind this mark paler brown ; 

 venter very pale yellow along its whole extent, or else a little darker 

 behind the rima epigastrica. Epigynum clear reddish-brown. Spin-

 yellowish. Legs without annulations, above reddish-brown (usually 

 paler than the light portion of the cephalothorax), below- the coxae, 

 femora and patellae lighter (of the same color as the sternum) ; owing 

 to the thick scopulse the inferior surfaces of the tibiae, metatarsi (also 

 the dorsal portion of the distal half of these), and the tarsi of I are 

 black, as of the tibia, metatarsus and distal half of the tibia of II, and 

 of the distal ends of the tarsi of III and IV.

Color of Males (in alcohol). — Differ from the female as follows: The 

 abdomen above is orange-brown (more clear orange anteriorly) ; at 

 each antero-lateral angle arises a broad black band that extends on 

 the side posteriorly as far as the middle ; venter pale brownish laterally, 

 the median region behind the lung-books being silvery with a pair of 

 closely approximated narrow, darker longitudinal lines. The coxce 

 and femora are greenish below. Palpi with all the joints brown above 

 and greenish below, except the tarsus, which is wholly black. 



Co77iparisons. — A species very well marked by the great width of 



the head region, and the gradual slope of the dorsal contour of the 



cephalothorax.

 Quadrilateral of the posterior eyes broader than long. 



Form. — Cephalothorax in front quite one-half its greatest transverse 

 diameter, highest at the posterior eyes, the posterior decHvity inclined 

 at fully 45° with the dorsal outHne. Head rather oblique and rounded. 

 Chelicera longer than the clypeus broad, almost twice the height of the 

 head in front, with three pairs of teeth. Labium longer than broad, 

 apically concave, less than one-half the length of the maxillae. Ster-

Color (in alcohol). — CephalotJiorax above -with a very narrow white 

 median line in the eye area extending back to the dorsal groove; the 

 extreme margin white; a broad submarginal band of orange on each 

 side, not extending to the head; a small reddish-yellow area around 

 the dorsal groove (and extending back to the posterior margin of the 

 thorax as a narrow band), from which broad radiating bands extend 

 to the submarginal band, about four of these bands on each side, and 

 each band narrowly white in front, black behind this, then reddish- 

 brown in its posterior half. The ocular area is blackish; the clypeus 

 and cheeks whitish above, postero-A'entral margin of each cheek with 

 a black spot. Sternum deep black. Abdomen above on its anterior 

 half with a broad median dark band edged with black, this band nar- 

 rowest anteriorly with sinuate margins and concavely truncated pos- 

 teriorly; it is bordered by orange-bro-vsm. At each antero-lateral mar- 

 gin of the dorsum arises a broader, interrupted black stripe which 

 extends almost to the spinnerets, and in its posterior half is simply an 

 area of black spots. Behind the median band is a series of four nar- 

 row, transverse black bands, whose lateral margins confluesce \nth. the 

 lateral black stripes. Sides orange-brown, marked posteriorly with 

 blackish spots. Venter pale greenish, -^-ith a sharply bounded, deep 

 black band extending from the rima epigastrica in front to a little an- 

 terior to the spinnerets behind, this black covering the whole venter 

 behind the lungs but not extending up the sides. Chelicera black with 

 orange hairs anteriorly, labium and maxillce black with paler tips. 

 Legs above yellowish, femora of I and II vAih. two almost contiguous, 

 parallel dark lines above, and another on the posterior aspect, these 

 represented by lines of black spots on III and IV; the patellae and 

 distal ends of the tibiae are brownish, the metatarsi and tarsi of I and II 

 pale bro\\Tiish. Below the coxse are chocolate-brown, the femiora very 

 pale yellow, the patellae and distal ends of the tibiae deep black, the 

 metatarsi and tarsi reddish-brown. Palpi yellow, femora above with 

 two longitudinal darker stripes, patella below slightly darker than 

 above, whole tarsus almost black. 



Comparisons. — Of all the species of the genus it comes closest to 

 texana, but apart from the differences in coloration and the palpal 

 organ it may be distinguished by tarsus I being more than one-half the 

 length of the metatarsus, while in texana this joint is decidedly less than 

 one-half this length.

 posterior declivity only slightly defined, but in the ^ the posterior 

 declivity is well marked from the dorsal outline. Chelicera massive, 

 their length more than twice the height of the head in front, longer 

 than the width of the clypeus, with 3 pairs of teeth. Labium longer 

 than wide, broadest at the tip where it is truncated, one-half the length

 ? 3.2 : 1; metatarsus IV shorter than patella and tibia combined. 



Genus TROCHOSA C. Koch, 1848. 



This genus is most closely allied to Lycosa, and differs from it mainly 

 in the following characters : The first row of eyes is fully as wide as the 

 second, or at least (as in avara and contestaia) the middle points of the 

 lateral eyes of the first row are as far lateral as the middle points of 

 the eyes of the second row; the sides of the head are obliquely arched, 

 and the cephalothorax highest at or behind the middle (except in the 9 

 of frondicola) ; the legs are usually comparatively short (only in cinerea 

 has leg IV a length of four times the cephalothorax), and their spines 

 are usually short (in rubicunda there is only one ventral spine on tibia 

 I). The posterior spinnerets are never longer, usually shorter than the 

 anterior. Metatarsus l\ is always shorter than the patella and tibia 

 combined. The chelicera are robust and arched anteriorly, with 3 

 teeth on their posterior margins (4 in contestata), and their length is 

 fully twice the height of the head in front. The length of the dorsal 

 eye area to the cephalothorax varies from 1 : 4.5 (cinerea) to 1 : 9 

 {rubicunda). The labium is longer than wide, and frequently one-half 

 or more the length of the maxillse (sepidchralis , frondicola, purcelli, 

 cinerea). 



There is a greater structural difference between Trochosa rubicunda 

 and Lycosa scutulata, than between the latter and Pardosa; so that if 

 we maintain the genus Pardosa we must also retain Trochosa.

Color (in alcohol). — Cephalothorax above blackish or deep brown in 

 the eye area, with a yellowish spot postero-lateral to each posterior eye. 

 A median yellow band arises between the posterior eyes, just behind 

 them enlarges to a width slightly broader than that of the ocular 

 area, is deeply constricted in front of the dorsal groove, enlarged to 

 its greatest diameter around this groove, constricted again behind 

 this groove and then slightly enlarged again at the posterior mar- 

 gin ; in its anterior portion this band contains a median and a pair 

 of lateral darker lines. There is a more Or less distinct broad, inter- 

 rupted yellow submarginal band on the posterior two-thirds of the 

 cephalothorax; a yellow line beneath the anterior eyes; while the 

 remainder of the cephalothorax is shining dark brown or blackish. 

 Sternum shining, with, few hairs, yellowish-brown with darker margins. 

 Abdomen in the brightest individuals above with a narrow median 

 green band on its anterior half, this band pointed at each end and 

 bordered|;laterally by a broader stripe of silvery-white interrupted by 

 black spots; on the posterior half of the dorsum the silvery-white is 

 continued as a few broad transverse areas, spotted by black ; lateral to 

 this silvery-white is a broader black area, deep black and not inter-

ruptecl anteriorly (on the anterior aspect of the abdomen the black 

 band of one side joins with that of the other), whila posteriorly the 

 black band widens and becomes mottled with biiff ; sides buff, spotted 

 with black posteriorly; venter yellow in front of the lung-books, 

 behind them pale brown with small spots of darker brown and black. 

 In other individuals the dorsum shows the same general pattern, but 

 the silvery- white is replaced by yellow and the black by brown. 

 Epigyniim reddish-brown. Spinnerets pale brown. Chelicera brown 

 or almost black, the macula red. Labium as dark as the chehcera but 

 with lighter distal end, and maxillce lighter. Legs in the brightest indi- 

 ^^duals clear greenish-yellow, distinctly ringed with black on all the 

 joints except the tarsi, each coxa black on its anterior and posterior 

 aspects, the tarsi reddish-brown. Palpi colored like the legs.

 from it in the coloration of the cephalothorax and of the abdominal 

 venter. The epigyna of the two are very similar. 



Habits. — Not common, on damp ground under stones, on the margin 



of streams.

 clypeal margin than to the second row, about straight or lateral eyes 

 slightly lower, middle eyes 1.5 times the size of the lateral. Eyes of 

 second row largest, slightly more than their diameter apart. Dorsal 

 eye area to cephalothorax as 1 : 4.75. Quadrilateral of the posterior 

 eyes broader than long. 



Form (?). — Cephalothorax highest at about the middle, in front 

 trmicated and not quite one-half its greatest transverse diameter, the 

 sides of the head oblique. Chelicera with 3 pairs of teeth, longer than 

 the width of the clypeus, their length 2.25 times the height of the head 

 in front. Labium longer than broad, shghtly concave apically, not 

 one-half the length of the maxillae. Sternum rounded. Leg. IV to 

 cephalothorax as 3.5 : 1. Metatarsus IV shorter than patella and 

 tibia combined. Spinnerets about equal in length. Palpal claw with 

 4 teeth. 



Remarks. — In addition to certain slight differences in the form of the 

 epigyna (mentioned in my preceding paper), this form is to be separated 

 from kochii in tha^ the cephalothorax in front is less than one-half its 

 greatest transverse diameter, instead of "vorn bedeutend mehr als 

 halb so breit als in der Mitte," and in being highest at or behind the 

 middle. The male which I had described as a new species (nigrau- 

 rata) is an tmusually bright-colored individual, Avith 4 teeth on the 

 posterior margin of one of the chehcera.

306 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [March, 



Eyes. — First row straight, as broad as the second, nearer the clypeal 

 margin than to the second row, middle eyes fully twice as large as the 

 lateral. Eyes of second row largest, their diameter apart. Dorsal 

 eye area to cephalothorax as 1 : 4.5. Quadrilateral of the posterior 

 eyes slightly longer than broad. 



Form. — Cephalothorax highest between the posterior eyes and the 

 dorsal groove, in front more than one-half its greatest transverse diam- 

 eter ( 9 ) or less (c?) and truncated ( 9 ) or rounded (c?). Sides of 

 head moderately oblique and rounded. Chelicera with 3 pairs of teeth, 

 much longer than the wudth of the clypeus, in length about 2.5 times 

 the height of the head in front. Labium longer than broad, truncated 

 apically, fully one-half the length of the maxillse. Legs strong with 

 short spines; leg IV to cephalothorax as 4 : 1; metatarsus IV shorter 

 than patella and tibia combined. ? palpal claw with 3 minute teeth. 

 d"' palpal tibia twice as long as the patella, and narrower, the point of 

 the tarsus fully as long as the bulbus. Anterior spinnerets longest. 



Comparisons. — This differs from the European form, judging from 

 Simon's description (Arachnides de France), in that the fourth tibia and 

 patella combined are considerably longer than the cephalothorax 

 (instead of the same length), and in that the fourth leg is 4 times the 

 length of the cephalothorax instead of 3.3 times. The two species may 

 prove to be distinct. 



The Texas specimens differ from the northern ones in large size 

 ( 9 with a cephalothoracal length of 7.5 mm.), and in being much paler 

 colored. 



Habits. — In the North this is a species of the sea coast. At Austin 

 it is common, particularly in the fall, under stones close to fresh water.

Genus PIRATA Sundevall, 1S33. 



The main combinations of characters of this genus are : The fii'st eye 

 row is fully as broad as the second (slightly shorter in elegans and 

 nigromacidatus); the length of the posterior spinnerets is quite 1.5 

 times that of the anterior, frequently twace; the metatarsus IV is in 

 both sexes shorter than the patella and tibia combined by only one- 

 third the length of the patella (one-half in marxi) ; the inferior tarsal 

 claw is toothed (except in marxi) ; the sides of the head are oblique 

 (except in elegans and the d^ of liber) ; the chelicera are weak, rather 

 straight anteriorly, their length not more, usually less, than twice the 

 height of the head in front; the labium is large and longer than broad. 

 The chelicera have 2 or 3 teeth on the posterior border. The eyes of 

 the second row are less than 1.5 times their diameter apart. The cepha- 

 lothorax is highest behind the middle, or in the cephaHc region (elegans). 

 Tibia I has 3 ventral pairs of spines. The length of leg IV to the cepha- 

 lothorax varies from 3.3 : 1 to 4.6 : 1 ; the legs have generally long spines 

 and frequently fine long hairs. 



It is somewhat doubtful whether this genus is a homogeneous one ; 

 marxi approaches Trochosa, and elegans, Lycosa. There are also some 




1904,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 



resemblances to Aidonia. All the species of Pirata known to nic live 

 beneath stones close to water, and spin for themselves during the cold 

 season little closed nests.

 second row than the margin of the clypeus, the middle eyes only slightly 

 larger than the lateral. Eyes of the second row one-half their diameter 

 apart. Length of dorsal eye area to cephalothorax as 1 : 5.5. Quad- 

 rilateral of the posterior eyes much wider than long. 



Form. — Cephalothorax without hairs, highest behind the posterior 

 eyes, posterior declivity very abrupt and steep, in front one-half its 

 greatest transverse diameter. Chelicera with 3 teeth anteriorly and 

 2 posteriorly, rather straight anteriorly, their length greater than the 

 width of the clypeus and about twice the height of the head in front.

length of the patella. No teeth on the inferior tarsal claws. Palpal 

 claw with 5 teeth. 



Comparisons. — This is the species identified by Emerton with the 

 European piraticus. But they are distinct, judging from the descrip- 

 tion given by Simon in his Arachnides de France. The structure of the 

 epigyna differs ; in marxi the median anterior eyes are but little larger 

 than the lateral (instead of almost double their size) and almost con- 

 tiguous (instead of being separated by a httle more than their diam- 

 eter), and further, these median eyes are much nearer each other than 

 to the lateral; in marxi also tibia and patella IV combined are longer 

 than the cephalothorax (instead of shorter) ; and there are differences 

 in coloration.

Color (in alcohol). — The cephalothorax is marked mth pale yellow 

 and pale brown ; the yellow forms a median band (half as wade as the 

 eye area) extending from this area to the median groove, and continu- 

 ing from there as a slightly broader band to the posterior margin; 

 a httle distance behind each posterior eye is another yellow band 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 



which joins the median one at the median groove; there is a broader 

 yellow submarginal band which does not extend to the head ; the 

 remainder of the cephalothorax is pale brown. Sternum yellow like the 

 coxse, ^\'ith a narrow brown margin. Abdomen above with a rather 

 narrow median yellow band largest at the anterior end and narrowing 

 to a point at the middle; from this point to the posterior end, with 

 more or less distinctness, is a series of 4-5 broad transverse yellow 

 markings, and a larger elongate yellow mark on each side of the median 

 band; all these yellow markings are demarcated by a ground color 

 of pale browai or dark greenish. The sides are mottled or streaked 

 with yellow or brown; the venter uniform pale yellow or pale brown. 

 Epigynnm black. Chelicera and maxiUce shining brownish, labium 

 darker. Legs yellow, femora annulated with greenish or brownish, 

 a white ring at the middle of the tibiae; in the (^ the tibiae, tarsi and 

 metatarsi of I and II and the metatarsi of IV are darker than the other 

 joints. Palpi yellowish, in the cJ^ the tarsal joint is brown. 



Comparisons. — This species differs from the related liber mainly in 

 form; greater relative length of legs; their greater hairiness; sides of 

 the head very oblique in the cJ* instead of vertical; the posterior 

 declivity of the cephalothorax in the cJ^ much less steep. 



Habits. — ^>ry al^undant at Austin, under moist stones close to 

 water.

 length of legs IV, II, I, III, III only slightly shorter than I and II, all 

 rather stout and scopulated; length of leg IV to cephalothorax as 

 4.3 : 1. 



Remarks. — The Texas specimens arc larger than the northern ones, 

 and the femora are more or less banded above with brownish. 



Habits. — Very abundant at Austin, under the stones close to streams. 



Females with cocoons are most abimdant in the fall. An adult male 



was found in November, and numerous nearly full-grown males in 



January.

 Eyes. — As in urinator. 



Form. — The general form of the 9 , proportions of the legs, mouth 

 parts, etc., are as in urinator. The cJ* differs in having the truncated 

 anterior end of the cephalothorax but little broader than one-fourth 

 its greatest transverse diameter, in the cephalothorax being distinctly 

 highest behind the middle, and in the greater slenderness of the legs, 

 which in order of length are IV, I, II, III. The palpus is longer than 

 the cephalothorax, its terminal joint large, the tibia with an elevated 

 lamina on the outer side, this lamina longer than wide and vdih its 

 free border forming two larger and one smaller tooth, the ventral apical 

 edge of the tibia with two teeth ; the proximal dorsal portion of the 

 tarsus has an elongated prominence .and a small elevated knob lateral 

 to this.

\nth its fellow of the opposite side it forms nearly a circle, its indistinct 

 posterior end joining the median b^id anterior to the middle and at 

 the point where a pair of small elongate black spots are apposed to 

 the median line. On each side of the thoracal portion are three sub- 

 marginal, rather broad and always distinct yellow marks which are 

 placed obliquel3^ The extreme margin is black, and there are reticular 

 black lines radiating from the dorsal groove. Sternum blackish with a 

 yellow median band. Abdomen above greenish-brown, patterned dis- 

 tinctly with yellow as follows : There is a narrow median orange band, 

 pointed at each end, which extends caudad not quite to the middle, 

 from which arises on each side three oblique yellow lines, one from its 

 posterior end, one (the longest) from its middle, and from its anterior 

 end one which passes Uke the others latero-caudad and then bends at an 

 angle to join the median band where the middle line joins it. On the 

 posterior half of the dorsum are 4 transverse yellow bands, each of the 

 shape of a W, the first of which is broadest and the first and second 

 most distinct. The sides are greenish-brown, the venter paler greenish 

 or yellowish. Chelicera black, labium and maxillce reddish-brown with 

 yellow ends. Legs above more or less distinctly ringed with yellow 

 and reddish-browai, with a number of alternating rings on the femora, 

 patellae brownish, tibise yellow at the middle and brown at the ends, 

 metatarsi dark at the middle and yellow at the ends, tarsi yellow proxi- 

 mally and brown distally; below the annulations are not as distinct as 

 above, the femora finely mottled with greenish-brown and yellow, the 

 coxse yellow and lighter than the sternum. Palpi like the legs. 



Color of Male (specimen from North Carohna, in alcohol). — Cephalo- 

 thorax \\ith the same pattern as in the $ , but with yellowish-brown in 

 place of dark brown. Abdomen like the 9 , but the yellow lines edged 

 with black. Mouth parts yellow. Legs pale yellow without annula- 

 tions, the distal ends of the tibiae, metatarsi and tarsi black. The pal 

 pus yellow, tibial apophysis and dorsal proximal portion of tarsus 

 black. 



Comparisons. — This may possibly be the same as D. scriptus of Hentz, 

 but that species is hardly recognizable from Hentz's brief description 

 and poor figure. It is nearly related to D. urinator Hentz (cf.).

Eyes ( ? ). — First row broader than the second, its lateral eyes 

 about their diameter from the sedbnd row, nearly straight, the middle 

 eyes being only shghtly lower than the lateral. Eyes of the second row 

 almost their diameter apart. Third row broadest, its eyes almost as 

 large as those of the second row and placed upon tubercles. Quadri- 

 lateral of the middle eyes about as broad as long. 



Fo7-m ( 9 ). — Cephalothorax in front truncated straight and not quite 

 one-half its greatest transverse diameter, highest behind the middle, the 

 cephalic portion demarcated from the thoracic, its greatest transverse 

 diameter ec|ualling the distance from the posterior eyes to its posterior 

 end, clypeus high and shghtly inclined. Chelicera with 4 ventral and 

 3 dorsal teeth. Labium shghtly longer than broad, shghtly rounded 

 apically, not one-half the length of the maxillae. Sternum rounded. 

 Legs slender, IV, II, I, III, IV longer than I by not quite the length of 

 its terminal joint. Length of leg IV to cephalothorax as 4.1 : 1. 

 Femur IV with a tuft of thickened hairs posteriorly near its dis- 

 tal end. 



Color in Alcohol ( 9 ). — The abdominal dorsum in all the specimens 

 shows anteriorly a more or less distinct median yellow line ending in a 

 point in front of the middle, and (generally less distinctly) a short 

 oblique yellow hue at each side of its anterior end; on the posterior 

 half are 3 pairs of small white spots, connected transversely by as m.any 

 black lines which are not of the shape of a W, but slightly curved with 

 the concavity directed caudad; each of these white spots is surrounded 

 by black, and only the 3 pairs on the posterior half of the dorsum are 

 always distinct, but anterior to them are 1-3 pairs which are usually 

 very indistinct (represented usually by small obscure black spots with- 

 out white centers). 



Characters of the c?. — An adult dried specimen of one of the original 

 males, described by Emerton as the male of iene6rosMs, was kindly loaned 

 to me by Mr. Emerton. The eyes are as in the ? , the first row almost 

 straight. The legs are in order I, II, IV, III. Femur IV has on its 

 posterior border near the distal end a prominent bunch of long thick- 

 ened hairs or short spines, which are much more prominent than in the 

 female. The palpal tibia has on its outer surface a long curved tooth, 

 and is on its ventro-distal border prolonged into a long toothed pro- 

 cess; the palpus is longer than the cephalothorax. This being a dried 

 specimen it is difficult to compare it with the alcoholic specimens of 

 the females; but the color of the legs is the same, and also the general 

 abdominal pattern (the 3 pairs of white spots are very distinct, and also 

 the slightly curved transversed blackish lines connecting them); the 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



cephalothorax has a broad submarginal white band on each side, con- 

 tinued also across the forehead. 



Comparisons. — There is no doubt that this is the urinator of Hentz ; 

 it possesses the pairs of small white spots on each posterior abdominal, 

 dorsum, and the shghtly cm-ved black lines (not of the shape of a W) 

 connecting them, all shown distinctly in Hentz's figure. It is closely 

 related to fontanus, and the epigyna of the two are very similar, but in 

 urinator it is always much broader than long, and its median piece has 

 a transverse groove just behind the middle, while in fontanus it is nearly 

 as long as broad and is without such a groove. There are a number of 

 constant differences, expressed in the key, which will serve to separate 

 the species. The females of idoneus may be easily distinguished from 

 those of both urinator and fontanus by the entirely different structure 

 of the epigynum, and by leg IV being longer than I by less than one- 

 third the length of the terminal joint. 

 Dolomedes idoneus Montgomery. 



Dolomedes idoneus Montgomery, 1902. 

 IDolomedes tenehrosus Hentz, 1841. 



( ? 9 from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Massachusetts.) 



Eyes. — First row broader than the second, its middle eyes shghtly 

 larger and decidedly lower than the lateral (the dorsal margin of the 

 middle eyes extends dorsad to a little beyond the level of the ventral 

 margin of the lateral eyes), lateral eyes quite twice their diameter in 

 front of the eyes of the second row. Eyes of the second row not quite 

 their diameter apart. Third row broadest, its eyes on tubercles. 

 Quadrilateral of the middle eyes as broad as long. 



Form ( 9 ). — Cephalothorax in front truncated straight, not quite 

 one-half its greatest transverse diameter, the cephalic portion demar- 

 cated from the thoracic, highest at the posterior eyes. Chelicera with 

 4 ventral and 3 dorsal teeth. Labium as in urinator. Sternimi 

 slightly longer than broad. Legs rather slender, IV, II, I, III, IV and 

 II nearly equal in length. Length of leg IV to cephalothorax as 4.1 : 1. 



Comparisons. — Of all of Hentz's species this most nearly approaches 

 his tenehrosus. But as I wrote before (1902), Hentz's description is 

 entirely insufficient as a diagnosis ; further, he placed tenehrosus under 

 the "tenebrosae" with the "eyes subequal, lower row as much curved 

 as the upper," which is not the case in idoneus; and his figm'e of th(? 

 mouth parts shows them entirely different from the condition in idoneus. 

 It is high time that tenehrosus, which has occasioned so much dispute, 

 should be allowed to fall into the synonymy on account of being 

 insufficiently characterized.

 convex apically. Posterior spinnerets longest. Legs slender, scopulse 

 not apparent, II, I, IV, III, legs I, II, and IV nearly equal in length. 

 Length of leg IV to cephalothorax as 4.4 : 1.

 Massachusetts, loaned by Mr. Emerton) had the cephalothoracal pat- 

 tern as in the 9 , but with the median band little darker than the sides. 

 The abdomen above with the narrow green median line on the anterior 

 half as in the 9 , but the broad brown band not at all defined, so that 

 'the dorsum is pale orange with on each side a row of several pale yellow, 

 short oblique lines, corresponding in position to the margin of the broad 

 brown band in the 9 . The rest of the coloration as in the 9 . 



Nearly mature males from Texas have the dorsal dark bands as 

 distinct as in the female.

obtaining, as far as possible, an exact knowledge of the development 

 of this Opisthobranch, in order that certain doubtful points regarding 

 the embryology of Mollusks in general, and this group in particular, 

 might be better understood. Fiona has proved in many ways a diffi- 

 cult object for study, but in certain respects offers advantages to the 

 investigator. The exact origin of the germ layers as they arise in the 

 segmenting egg has been particularly sought throughout the cleavage 

 history, while in later stages attention has been directed to the rise of 

 larval organs from their particular protoblasts where these could be 

 definitely determined. Where this has been found impossible, approxi- 

 mate results are given. Certain questions have presented themselves 

 both at the beginning and during the progress of this work, some of 

 which may here be indicated briefly. Though it has not been my pur- 

 pose to consider particularly the mechanics of cleavage, this phase 

 of development has been borne in mind, and in certain instances 

 discussed. Comparisons are made between the nearly equal cleavage 

 of Fiona and the more unequal segmentation of many other molluscan 

 and annehdan eggs. The manner of origin of the germ layers is nat- 

 urally a point of cardinal interest to the cell-lineage worker, since by 

 this method of investigation the most exact results are possible and 

 very definite comparisons ^dth other forms may be made. The exact 

 derivation of the middle germ layer has been sought particularly. 

 Has it a single or double mode of origin? If both "primary" and 

 "secondary" mesoderm be present, which is "larval" and which forms 

 permanent organs? How is the mesoderm segregated from the two 

 primary germ layers? In the study of larval structure and develop- 

 ment the excretory organs are of much interest, since widely diverse 

 views are held regarding the mode of origin and the significance of 

 both primitive and definitive molluscan kidneys. The axial relations 

 between ovum and larva and the relations of the early cleavage planes 

 to the median plane of the larva and adult are points of great interest. 

 How and when does bilaterahty first appear? When does trosion 

 first become manifest and what is its immediate cause? These and 

 other questions have arisen and have been borne in mind during the 

 progress of the work. Unfortmiately material for the study of later 

 larval stages and metamorphosis has not been obtainable, so that a 

 complete record of development from ovimi to adult has been impos- 

 sible. 



The work was begun in the early summer of 1901, at the Zoological 

 Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania, and continued, together 

 with general graduate study, during the two following years at this 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



University, as well as throughout the two intervening summers at the 

 Woods Hole Marine Biological Laborator}-. 



I am glad to acknowledge the many courtesies extended to me at 

 both institutions. I am particularly indebted to Prof. Conkhn, at 

 whose suggestion the work was undertaken, and it is a pleasure to ex- 

 press here my sincere appreciation of the valuable assistance which 

 he has given me by way of suggestion and kindly criticism. 



Material and Methods. 



For the material upon which this study has been made, I am 

 indebted to Drs. E. G. Conkhn and M. A. Bigelow, by whom it was 

 collected at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, during the summers of 1897 

 and 1898. The Nudibranchs were found spawning upon floating 

 gulf-weed in Vineyard Sound, taken to the Laboratory and kept in 

 aquaria for some weeks, where they spawned prolifically and where, 

 from day to day, the eggs were collected and preserved. They were 

 fixed in Kleinenberg's stronger picro-sulphuric solution and Boveri's 

 picro-acetic for one-half to three-quarters of an hour and washed in 

 50 and 70 per cent, alcohol, as is the usual custom. Living material 

 upon which to study the breeding habits of the animals has not been 

 accessible to me, though search has been made in the same locality 

 during the last two summers. This lack of the living adult animals 

 and embryonic stages has been a considerable drawback, as it is par- 

 ticularly desirable that one investigating the developmental history of 

 an organism should be able to observe its physiological activities and 

 thereby verify conclusions gained through purely morphological work. 

 The material at hand has been amply sufficient for carrying the work 

 up to the stage of the free-swimming veliger, but not to the metamor- 

 phosis. It is my hope that in the near future material for the study 

 of later stages and of the metamorphosis into the adult may be 

 obtained, as many questions relative to the fate of larval organs must 

 remain unanswered until this be accomplished. 



Contrary to the conditions found among some other Nudibranchs, 

 the gelatinous mass surrounding the egg-capsules does not become 

 greatly hardened upon fixing, for upon being brought into water the 

 jelly usually dissolves, leaving the eggs free in their individual capsules. 

 The eggs may be sectioned without removing the jelly, as it cuts 

 without difficulty. Both whole mounts and sections were stained in 

 Delafield's hsematoxylin diluted with six to ten times its volume of 

 distilled water and slightly acidulated by the addition of a trace of

This stain gives a reddish tint which differentiates the nuclei with great 

 distinctness. Iron hsematoxylin proved entirely unsatisfactory for 

 sections of both early and late stages, for even in the old veligers almost 

 all the cells are found to contain small yolk spherules which take up 

 the hsematoxylin so strongly and hold it so tenaciously that nuclei and 

 cell walls are indistinguishable. Eggs which have just been stained 

 and mounted are not favorable objects for study, but they should, 

 if possible, stand for some time, the longer the better, until they gradu- 

 ally become more transparent by the penetration of balsam. Indeed, 

 the most favorable shdes are a few put up at the time the material 

 was collected. By the addition of a little cedar oil to the balsam, or 

 by moistening the edges of the cover with xylol at the time of using, 

 it is always possible to roll the eggs by moving the cover — a very 

 necessary process in cell-lineage work. Most of the observation and 

 drawing was done with the aid of a Leitz objective 7, ocular 4, a 

 Zeiss camera being used, with the paper at table level and plates re- 

 duced as indicated. A -^ Leitz immersion was also used for obser- 

 vation when necsseary. 



NOMEXCLATURE. 



As a matter of convenience and for the sake of uniformity, I have 

 followed the system used by Conklin (1897) with but slight variation. 



A cleavage is oblique to the right when the upper daughter cell lies 

 to the right of an imaginary observer whose body corresponds in posi- 

 tion to the primary egg axis, his head being at the animal pole and 

 facing the cell considered; vice versa, a division oblique to the left is 

 one in which the upper cell lies to the observer's left. In the first 

 instance the cleavage is dexiotropic, in the second Iceotropic (Lillie, 1895). 



The term "quartet" is used to designate a generation of cells or 

 their derivatives given off from the four cells meeting in the center of 

 the vegetative pole, regardless of their fate. The different quartets 

 are designated by coefficients placed before the letter indicating in 

 which of the four quadrants the cells lie, while the cell generations are 

 marked by exponents which follow the letter. The upper cell resulting 

 from a cleavage is, in all cases, indicated by the smaller exponent; 

 thus, 2b" indicates the upper cell in B quadrant of the second quartet 

 arising from the division of 2b\ while 2b*^ is the lower. When the 

 spindle lies in a horizontal direction or, in other words, when the cleav- 

 age plane is meridional, the cell which hes to the right is given the 

 smaller exponent, to the left the larger. The capital letters A, B, C, 

 and D are reserved for the four cells which meet at the center of the 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 329 



vegetative pole ("macromeres") and from which the "micromeres" 

 arise; for these latter the small letters a, b, c and d are used. Child 

 (1900) and Tread well (1901) have been followed in giving coefficients to 

 the macromeres also, to indicate their generation, this being desirable 

 when dealing with an egg in which, after the first few cleavages, the 

 "macromeres" are large in name only. "Thus A, B, C, and D form 

 the four-cell stage. At their next division from A arises lA and la; 

 from B, IB and lb, etc.; lA then divides into 2A and 2a, while la 

 divides into la^ and la'" (Trcadwell). 



Earlier Work ox Opisthobranch Development. 



A rather large number of older investigators have worked upon 

 Nudibranch larval development. Grant (1827) described the vehgers 

 of ^Eolis and Doris. In 1837 Sars discovered that the young of Tri- 

 tonia, Doris and J^olis possess a nautiloid shell; additional researches 

 by the same investigator appeared in 1840 and 1845. Loven (1839) 

 described a number of Nudibranch larvae together with those of other 

 moUusks. Alder and Hancock's magnificent monograph upon the 

 British Xudibranchs appeared in 1845 and contains a good general 

 account of the results thus far obtained upon the subject of Nudi- 

 branch embryology. Reid in 1846 published an interesting paper upon 

 the breeding habits of Doris, Goniodoris, Polycera, Dendronotus, Doto, 

 etc., together wdth the constitution of the larvae. An account of the 

 embryology of Tergipes by Nordman appeared in the same year. An 

 extremely thorough account of the development of the Tectibranch 

 Actaeon by Vogt also appeared in 1846. In 1848 Koren and Danielssen 

 described the early stages of a number of Nudibranchs from the Nor- 

 wegian coast. Schneider (1858) described the veliger of Phyllorhoe. 

 Keferstein and Ehlers (1861) gave an account of some of the develop- 

 mental stages of jEoUs. 



The later investigations of Langerhans (1873), Lankester (1875), 

 Trinchese (1880-1-7), Lacaze-Duthiers and Pruot (1887), Rho (1888), 

 Mazzarelh (1892-3-5), Heymons (1893), Viguier (1898), Carazzi (1900), 

 Guiart (1901), and other works upon Opisthobranch embryology, 

 together with those of importance pertaining to the remaining mol- 

 luscan groups. Annelids and Platodes, will be considered during the 

 course of this paper. 



A good general account of spawning habits of Nudibranchs is found 

 in Alder and Hancock's "Monograph of the British Nudi branchiate 

 MoUusca" (1845).

Maturation and Fertilization. 



It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss in detail the maturation 

 processes of the egg, but a few words in that connection may not be 

 amiss. Maturation appears to have begun at the time of laying, since 

 the first polar spindle is already formed in all eggs examined. In 

 fig. 1 the chromosomes have moved to opposite ends of the first matu- 

 ration spindle, and at a slightly later period, fig. 2, the sperm may be 

 seen making its way through the yolk globules toward the upper pole. 

 In a large number of sections examined the sperm is seen to have 

 entered at some point below the equator of the egg, though apparently 

 never directly at the center of the vegetative pole. The chromatin 

 of the sperm nucleus is but shghtly evident at this time, but astral 

 radiations are strongly marked in the surrounding cytoplasm. The 

 clear more protoplasmic substance of the egg becomes aggregated 

 principally around the first polar spindle and in the neighborhood of 

 the sperm nucleus, though long strands of finely granular protoplasm 

 extend through nearly the entire egg, forming the astral rays. The 

 yolk, which is in the form of rather small yolk globules, encroaches 

 closely upon these centers, but is not, as a rule, found v/ithin them. 

 As the first polar body arises, the upper surface of the egg becomes 

 distinctly indented immediately above the first polar spindle and from 

 this depression the first polar body emerges, bearing with it the distal 

 end of the first maturation spindle, which rises as a whole toward the 

 upper surface of the egg. During this process the sperm nucleus and 

 aster remain in relatively the same position as before. There appears 

 to be no telophase to this division, but without entering into a rest stage 

 the second polar body is given off. This arises from the same place as 

 the first, pushing the latter farther outward or somewhat toward the 

 side (PI. XXI, fig. 3). Both finally lie in the slight depression at the 

 surface of the egg. The female nuclear elements still left within the 

 egg then come to rest, at first lying closely against the cell wall below 

 the polar bodies. The first polar body does not divide again immedi- 

 ately and may never do so, though usually at a later period three are 

 found. If it remains undivided the first polar body exceeds the second 

 in size. 



With the close of maturation the sperm nucleus is seen to have moved 

 upward through the yolk; its chromatic elements have become more 

 evident several large nucleoli being present. The same is true of 

 the female pronucleus. They now approach each other, and come to lie 

 with their nuclear walls closeh' appresscd (fig. 4), the egg nucleus lying 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 331 



above and the sperm, which is the smaller, below. The clear granular 

 protoplasm of the egg together with the sphere material surrounds both 

 nuclei. The upper surface of the egg has resumed its former rounded 

 outline, pushing the polar bodies farther outward. Their connection 

 with the egg does not appear to be a very intimate one for they do not, 

 in most cases, maintain at a later period any fixed relation to the poles 

 of the egg and so are of little value in orientation, though they are 

 often found in the apical region. 



Unsegmented Egg. 



The unsegmented egg of Fiona averages in diameter 80 micra with 

 polar axis sHghtly less. The two polar bodies lie at the animal pole. 

 Though the ovum is rather densely yolk-ladened, the yolk globules are 

 of such small size that in future cleavages they tend to become more 

 equally distributed among the resulting blastomeres than is the case 

 with eggs containing yolk in larger spheres. The yolk which en- 

 croaches upon the more protoplasmic environs of the nucleus consists 

 of smaller globules, but otherwise its distribution throughout seems 

 quite equal. 



The- universal distribution of yolk to all the cells of the segmenting 

 egg of Fiona is probably to be correlated with the smaller size of the 

 individual yolk globules. It is safe to infer that each yolk body in an 

 egg, whether it be small or large, is surrounded by a thin layer of 

 protoplasm. In eggs containing a relatively larger number of yolk 

 globules or, in other words, where they are small in size, a greater 

 amount of cytoplasm will be distributed throughout the egg, when 

 compared with that aggregated around the nucleus, than is the case 

 when the single aggregations of yolk are large. Wlien this is the case 

 and division occurs the whole mass will be more influenced by nuclear 

 and cytoplasmic divisional activity than when the cytoplasmic con- 

 stituents are more definitely separated from the yolk. Just what this 

 activity is we do not know, but a comparative study of eggs showing 

 large macromeres with those like Fiona, in which cleavage is more 

 equal, will, I think, show that in the former case the individual yolk 

 masses are much larger than in the latter, thus allowing for greater 

 cytoplasmic influence where more finely divided yolk is found. The 

 more equal division of cells naturally results in a wider spread of yolk 

 through the developing organism, and it might also be added, as a corol- 

 lary to this, that the absorption of m.ore finely divided yolk is doubtless 

 much more readily accomplished than where large globules are fomid, 

 thus -rendering it possible that such a wide distribution should occur in 

 cells not alimentary in function. 




332 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Before segmentation the nucleus lies but slightly above the center 

 of the egg, having moved downward with its surrounding mass of 

 granular protoplasm. An extremely thin and easily ruptured vitelline 

 membrane surrounds the egg, and on account of the delicacy of this 

 membrane no micropyle is present. Usually one but often two or 

 three eggs lie together within a roomy egg capsule, containing also a 

 fluid substance which does not coagulate in reagents. In unstained 

 fixed material, and also doubtless in the living state, the eggs are quite 

 opaque from the yolk which they contain. 



First Cleavage. 



The first cleavage is initiated by nuclear rupture and increased evi- 

 dence of stellar radiation. With the formation and elongation of the 

 spindle the surrounding yolk spherules give place to the more proto- 

 plasmic constituents of the cell which form the immediate nuclear 

 environs. The spindle as it elongates moves somewhat farther down- 

 ward in the egg and lies but slightly above the equatorial plane. In 

 length it measures about half the diameter of the egg. From the first 

 constriction is almost equally marked all around the egg, though 

 slightly greater at the animal pole. After the chromosomes- have 

 separated and are moving toward the opposite ends of the spindle, one 

 end appears somewhat higher than the other (fig. 5), a position which 

 would indicate a spiral trend of cleavage; but this is not evident in 

 Ihe telophase and completed division, for in the two-cell stage the 

 nuclei lie directly opposite each other. 



As in the usual history of cleaving eggs, the resulting blastomeres 

 are at first much rounded, but as their nuclei form they become closely 

 pressed together, forming a flattened contact surface between which 

 no cleavage cavity exists (fig. 6). The nuclei, together with their 

 surrounding cytoplasm, again approach the upper surface of the egg 

 and lie at rest just beneath the surface on opposite sides of the polar 

 bodies. There is no evidence in their position to indicate a ''virtual" 

 rotation before the next cleavage, as is the case in Crepidida (Conklin, 

 1897) . The daughter nuclei of the first cleavage becomes much dilated, 

 containing several nucleoli suspended in the chromatin network and 

 surrounded by clear nuclear fiuid. 



The two blastomeres thus formed are equal or so nearly equal in 

 size that they present to the observer no mark of distinction, and it 

 can only be conjectured Which will form the anterior and which the 

 posterior region of the larva. Indeed, not imtil the appearance of 

 the mesentodermal cell at the close of the twenty-four-cell stage can 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 333 



this distinction be drawn, for until that time all quadrants appear 

 identical, though doubtless cytoplasmic and nuclear differentiation is 

 present. As a result of this similarity of all the quadrants the figures, 

 until the appearance of the mesentoderm cell, have of necessity been 

 labelled arbitrarily. Of course, even in the two-cell stage lateral may 

 be distinguished from terminal areas, for by following succeeding 

 cleavages and marking the relation which the lower polar furrow bears 

 to the first cleavage plane and the later relation of both to the median 

 plane of the embryo, it can be determined that the first cleavage plane 

 is obliquely transverse to the median plane. But not until a later 

 period does posterior become distinguishable from anterior end. 



In the formation by first cleavage of two cells of equal size, Fiona 

 agrees with a large number of Mollusks and Annelids, among the former 

 of which may be mentioned Ischnochiton (Heath, 1899), Neritina 

 (Blochmann, 1881), Crepidula (Conklin, 1897), Ercolania (Trinchese, 

 1880), Tethijs (Viguier, 1898), Planorbis (Rabl, 1879, and Holmes, 

 1900), Limax (Kofoid, 1895, and Meissenheimer, 1896), and among the 

 latter Lepidonotus (Mead, 1897) and Podarke (Tread well, 1901). 



Unequal cleavage appears to occur as commonly as equal among 

 Opisthobranchs, examples of w^hich are Acera (Langerhans, 1873), 

 Aply sia {Blochmaim, 1883; Carazzi, 1900), Umbrella (Heymons, 1893) 

 and Philine (Guiart, 1901). 



Second Cleavage. 



The second cleavage results in four cells of approximately equal 

 size. The spindles which precede it lie at right angles to the first 

 cleavage spindle, and nearly parallel to each other, the left end of each, 

 however, being slightly higher than the right, showing the Iseotrophic 

 character of the division. As cleavage proceeds this tendency becomes 

 more marked, the upper or left-hand cells (A and C) lying higher than 

 the right (B and D). In consequence of this the second cleavage planes 

 do not meet in a fine at the vegetative pole, but a portion of the original 

 first cleavage plane unites them in the ventral polar furrow ("Quer- 

 furche" or "Brechungslinie"), the cells B and D being in contact below, 

 while A and C never meet at the lower pole. At the upper pole no fur- 

 row is present in Fiona, the four cells all joining in a common central 

 point. As is the rule among Annelids and Mollusks in which the 

 second cleavage is laeotropic, the ventral polar furrow taken in connec- 

 tion with the first cleavage plane, bends to the right when viewed from 

 the animal pole, and, vice versa, it turns to the left if considered as a 

 part of the second cleavage plane. Fiona is no exception to the above 




334 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



rule, and by observing the position of this furrow the first and second 

 cleavage planes may be kept distinctly in mind until outwardly visible 

 differential changes in the quadrants present other landmarks for orien- 

 tation. 



Origin of Germ Layers. 



Segregation of the Ectohlast. * 



By the next three divisions in which the four macromercs participate 

 the entire ectoblast arises. 



First Quartet. — The spindles which precede the appearance of the 

 first quartet of micromeres lie at first nearly radial, their prox- 

 imal ends being distinctly higher than the distal. As a rule, all 

 four spindles do not show the same stage of karyokinetic activity, 

 though irregularities of this nature are not as yet greatly marked 

 (fig. 9). As division proceeds they turn in a dexiotropic direction and 

 with associated cytoplasmic constrictions four small cells are given 

 off toward the animal pole (PI. XXII, figs. 10, 11). These, the first 

 quartet of micromeres, are in size about one-fourth that of their 

 parent macromeres. As they round out in shape they are pushed 

 farther toward the right, and finally come to lie in the furrows to 

 the right of the large cells from which they arose. With the com- 

 pletion of cleavage the whole egg again takes on a decidedly rounded 

 contour, the micromeres changing materially in shape, becoming 

 more flattened on their outer surfaces and sharp-angled below to 

 fit the indentations between the macromeres (fig. 14). 



Second Quartet. — The second quartet arises Iteotropically, thus regu- 

 larly alternating in direction of cleavage with the first. The derived 

 micromeres are but slightly smaller than the underlying cells from 

 which they arise and are pushed strongly toward the left as they are 

 given off. By this movement the four cells of the first quartet are 

 also carried somewhat to the left, though the rotation is not great. 

 All the second quartet cells are alike in size, there being no sign of 

 increase in D quadrant, as is the case with many Annelids and some 

 Mollusks; nor is there marked difference in their time of origin, though 

 in future cleavages of the egg irregularities in the time at which divi- 

 sions occur in similar cells of the four quadrants become more and 

 more marked. In cytoplasmic structure these cells appear to differ 

 little from their parent macromeres, though probably they contain 

 less yolk. Their ultimate position is opposite and beneath the divi- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



sion walls of the first quartet, but they do not appear to become so 

 flattened as their predecessors (figs. 13, 14). 



The Trochoblasts. — Before the macromeres again divide the first 

 quartet is seen to be in process of cleavage. There result eight cells 

 of nearly equal size, the more peripheral being slightly smaller than 

 those at the apical pole. The spindles which precede division are 

 Igeotropically directed, and the lower cells are pushed do^Tiward and 

 outward between the second quartet cells and just above the macro- 

 meres (figs. 15, 16). These "primary trochoblasts" or "turret cells" 

 do not again divide until about sixty cells are present (PL XXV, 

 figs. 33, 38), when they have become considerably flattened and lie 

 between the arms of the forming ectoblastic cross. The fate of these 

 very characteristic cells will be discussed later. 



Third Quartet and First Divisio7i of Second Quartet. — The first 

 division of the second quartet and the third division of the macro- 

 meres occur simultaneously. Each second quartet cell forms two 

 of equal size by a distinctly dexiotropic cleavage, the spindles being 

 from the first incHned in that direction. As may be seen in figs. 17 

 and IS, these cells do not all divide at exactly the same time, and this 

 lack of regularity is also characteristic of the macromeres. By this 

 division of the second quartet the eight cells of the first are pushed back- 

 ward dexiotropically so that, in relation to the macromeres, they occupy 

 the same place as when given off. The division of the macromeres 

 results m the four cells of the third quartet. They arise in a dexiotropic 

 manner and are equal in size to the four cells left at the lower pole. 

 From this stage on these latter are "macromeres" in name onh^, being 

 equalled in size by the third quartet and but slightly larger than the 

 eight derivatives of the second. Nor, indeed, do the macromeres 

 appear at this stage to contain much more yolk than the micromeres. 

 At a later period they are easily discernible from the micromeres by 

 their clear yellow appearance, but as the latter divide much more rap- 

 idly and by growth distribute the yolk which the}' contain over a 

 larger area, while much of it is doubtless absorbed, the preponderance 

 of this material in the individual cells of the endoderm and the larger 

 cells of the mesoderm as well is easily explained. As has been men- 

 tioned before, in the larva the amount of yolk in ectodermal struc- 

 tures is quite considerable, showing its wide and universal distribu- 

 tion throughout the entire organism. 



The twenty-four-cell stage has thus been reached and as yet the egg 




336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April. 



is radiall}- symmetrical (PI. XXIII, fig. 19). At the center of the upper 

 pole lie fom" "apical" cells, while the " trochoblasts " or "turret cells" 

 extend from them into the angles between the second and third quartet 

 cells. The third quartet and first generation of second quartet lie 

 between them and the macromeres beneath, but from the nature of the 

 cleavages do not form so marked a ring as in Crepidula or other 

 Mollusks with large macromeres. The ectoblast has been entirely 

 separated from the underlying macromeres, which contain all of the 

 entoblast and the greater portion of the mesoblast. A small portion 

 of the latter is to be derived, as will be showTi later, from the third 

 quartet of ectoblast cells. The egg has become somewhat flattened 

 along its polar axis and within is a small cleavage cavity, which arose 

 during the last few di\dsions and which later becomes of considerable 

 size. Upon the lower surface the polar furrow remains distinct and 

 offers a convenient means of orientation. 



The fact that in MoUusks, AimeHds and Platodes the entire ectoblast 

 is separated from the entoblast by the first three successive divisions 

 in which the macromeres participate is a point of similarity of the 

 highest importance in considering the question of the possible genetic 

 relationships of the groups. With scarcely an exception {Dreissensia, 

 Meissenheimer, 1901) this is accompHshed bj^ regularly alternating 

 spiral cleavages. In most cases the first three quartets of micromeres 

 are small protoplasmic cells and differ \ndely from the 3^olk-ladened 

 macromeres, and this is particularly true of the fu'st series being corre- 

 lated with the later history of the cells which compose it, since in all 

 cases they form the apical pole and the sense organs of the larva. 

 Where much yolk is not present, or the spherules are small, more equal 

 cleavage results, so that the macromeres are reduced in size; as exam- 

 ples may be cited many Pulmonates (Planorbis, Physa, Limncea, Limax) 

 and Lamelhbranchs (t/w2o, Cyclas, Dreisserisia) , Chiton and Ischnochiton 

 among the Amphineura, Trochus for the Prosobranchs and the Opistho- 

 branchs Tethys and Fiona. The same is true of many Annelids 

 {Podarke, Amphitrite, Clymenella, Arenicola, etc.). 



Both in size of ceUs and rate and direction of division the egg of 

 Tethys (Viguier, 1898) exactly parallels that of Fiona up through the 

 twenty-four-cell stage. The same may be said of Aplysia (Carazzi, 

 1900, and Georgeovitch as corrected by Carazzi, 1900), except for the 

 larger size of the macromeres, particularly the anterior ones, and Ca- 

 razzi's statement that the trochoblasts arise from di\-ision of the first 

 quartet — "con fusi distintamente dessiotropici." Such is, however, 

 not the case, as his figures show. Carazzi has evidently, in some 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 



unaccountable way, become confused with regard to the direction of 

 cleavage of these cells, for in another place, after quoting Conklin's 

 statement regarding the trochoblasts of Crepidula, that these cells 

 "continue to rotate in a clockwise direction," he adds "E la sua fig. 16 

 mostra i fusi dessiotropic". As any one acquainted vriih cell-Hneage 

 work can see by reference to the figure mentioned, the upper ends of 

 the spindles all he to the left of the lower, and if there be any question 

 as to the ultimate laeotropic direction of these cleavages a glance at 

 Conklin's fig. 17 removes all doubt. In Trochus (Robert, 1903), Crepi- 

 dula (ConkHn, 1897) and Fiona the trochoblasts are given off by divi- 

 sion of the four cells of the first quartet before the second quartet cells 

 divide. In the case of Trochus the second quartet is just being formed 

 when the trochoblasts divide. Moreover, Trochus shows no rest stage 

 at twenty-four cells as do the other two, for while the third quartet is 

 forming and the second is dividing for the first time all eight cells of 

 the first quartet again divide, and these cleavages are followed by re- 

 newed division of second quartet cells. The mesoblast cell, 4d, does 

 not form in Trochus at this time but much later (sixty-fom'-cell stage), 

 while in Crepidula and Fiona it appears immediately after a short rest 

 period following the twenty-four-cell stage. The sequence of cleavages 

 of Planorbis (Holmes, 1900) up to the twenty-four-cell stage closely 

 follows Crepidula and Fiona. 



Segregation of Ento-Mesoblast. 



After a period of rest during which no cells are dividing and twenty- 

 four are present in the egg, cleavage occurs in one of the macromeres. 

 This macromere corresponds to that which has heretofore been arbi- 

 trarily designated 3D, and from this period onward the four quartets 

 may be definitely distinguished. The division is laeotropic and the 

 larger daughter cell, 4d, will later gradually sink into the segmentation 

 cavity, forming a depression at the posterior end of the vegetative 

 surface in the angle formed by the macromeres 3C and 4D, and other- 

 wise bounded by 3d, 3c and the derivatives of 2d. 4d is thrown toward 

 the left and, therefore, in the direction of the median plane, though at 

 first it does not lie quite in that plane but slightly to the left of it or, 

 in terms of spiral cleavage, to its right (PI. XXIV, fig. 24). In con- 

 tradistinction to conditions found in heavily yolk-ladened eggs, this 

 cell takes on from the beginning the position of a middle germ layer 

 coming shortly to lie within the cleavage cavity, though, as will be seen 

 later, its derivatives do not all appear to be mesodermal in character. 

 After all three quartets and also the macromeres with the exception

of 4D have divided, and when there are present about 44 cells (fig. 25), 

 4d or, as it hereafter will be designated more usuallj', the mesento- 

 blast, ME, divides dexiotropically into cells of equal size. Before their 

 next cleavage occurs the egg contains about seventy cells (fig. 42). By 

 this di\dsion, which is bilateral, one small cell arises anteriorly from 

 each of the large ones (figs. 42. 49). The small cells, E^ and E^, corre- 

 spond to the "Primary Enteroblasts" of Conklin, and will be so desig- 

 nated. Considerable variation may be observed in different eggs as to 

 the later position of these cells, as in some they appear to have moved 

 backward along the sides of the large cells. ]\Ie\, Me-, from which they 

 arose, but, as a rule, they remain in close relation to 4D, and always in 

 later stages may be seen associated with the derivatives of this cell, from 

 which it is hard to distinguish them (PI. XXIX, figs. 71, 73). The large 

 cells soon divide again into almost equal parts, though the posterior 

 and dorsal pair (m^z\ m^z^) are slightly smaller (fig. 71). These latter 

 soon divide again, giving rise to two small cells, z^ and z-, which are 

 posterior to the larger (fig. 73). Just before this cleavage the two 

 cells M^e\ M^e^ di\dde, giving rise anteriorly and toward 4D to two 

 small cells, e^ and e^ (corresponding to the "Secondary Enteroblasts" 

 of Conklin), which Ue close to the first pair of small cells, E\ E^, the 

 four forming a group of little cells v.-ith deeply staining nuclei in close 

 contact -^-ith 4D, 5C and 5B. Behind them lie the large cells M\ M^. 

 In the nomenclature used these would correspond to "Mesoblastic 

 Teloblasts," but before they begin to fimction directly as such each 

 again di\'ides. giving off a small cell laterally, and these two cells appear 

 to be dorsally directed toward the cleavage cavity above and to the 

 sides of the enteron, but may remain associated with E\. E^, e^ and e-. 

 However this may be, the mesoblastic teloblasts soon begin to divide, 

 giving off an irregular row of cells which extend around the gastrula 

 laterally. The cells m* and m^ also behave in a similar manner, their 

 derivatives being closely associated with those of the large teloblasts. 

 In figiu'es 80, 81 and 82 only the derivatives of the latter are shown, 

 the other lying dorsal to them. As the teloblasts and the cells m^ 

 and m^ divide they diverge lateraDy and leave behind and between 

 them the smaller cells E^, E^, e\, e^, closely associated with the posterior 

 elements of the enteron. WTien these cells are first given off they 

 lie decidedly above the level of the enteric invagination projecting 

 upward into the cleavage cavity, and while in this position might well 

 be characterized as mesodermal elements ; but later they change their 

 position, slipping in between the teloblasts and the posterior cells of the 

 enteron, and by the time the teloblasts begin to separate and wander 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 339 



toward the sides of the gastrula these small cells, which have been 

 derived from 4d. lie nearer the ventral surface than the cells which 

 form the bottom of the invaginating enteron and closely appressed 

 against the posterior boundary of this region. The small cells z\ z^, 

 which are the posterior derivatives of the division of m^z\ m'z^, also 

 continue to lie near the median line in the posterior region of the 

 gastrula, closely pressed and flattened against the ectoderm. 



The later history of the enteroblasts, which I believe are concerned 

 in the formation of the intestine, will be discussed in connection with 

 the development of the enteron. 



In comparing the mesoblast formation of Fiona with that of other 

 forms, Crepidula will be considered first, since in this Prosobranch 

 4d was first foimd to contain both entoblastic and mesoblastic material 

 (Conkhn, 1897). Here 4d arises when twenty-four cells are present 

 and by a laeotropic division. This cell soon cleaves dexiotropically 

 into two of equal size. At the next cleavage there result in Crepidula 

 four cells of similar size, the posterior and lower pair being the first 

 enteroblasts, while in Fiona it is the anterior smaller cells which are 

 entoblastic. At the next cleavage in Crepidula the large cells Me^, Me^, 

 which still contain both mesoblast and entoblast, give off smaller 

 purely mesoblastic cells anteriorly (m\ m^), while in Fiona the larger 

 posterior cells give rise posteriorly to similar cells, though they may 

 not be purely mesoblastic. The next cleavage of I\PeS M-e^ in Cre- 

 pidula completely segregates mesoblast and entoblast, the cells of 

 the latter lying posterior to the mesodermal elements. This division 

 separates two more small enteroblasts in Fiona, which here he with 

 the first enteroblasts anterior to the large cells, M^, W; each gives 

 rise to another small cell anteriorly in Fiona which may be entero- 

 blastic, otherwise from this period on they function as teloblasts of 

 the mesoderm. 



From the above comparison it is evident that if we consider the 

 position of the mesodermal and endodermal constituents of 4d in 

 connection with the segmented egg as a whole, directly opposite 

 conditions are found. In Crepidula the derivatives of this cell form 

 mesoderm anteriorly and laterally, entoderm posteriorly, while in 

 Fiona the reverse is the case. But in both forms, if we consider the 

 position of the enteroblasts not in relation to the egg as a whole, but 

 only in connection with the macromeres with which they are to be 

 associated, it will be seen that in both Crepidula and Fiona these cells 

 are directed toward the posterior region of the cells 4D, 4C, or their de- 

 rivatives, and that the reverse relations of the enteroblasts and meso-

blasts in Crepidula and Fiona is the direct result of epibolic gastrulation 

 in'the one case, embolic in the other, which is in turn caused by the 

 quantity and natme of the yolk which the 

 macromeres contain. An intermediate 

 condition is found in Nereis (Wilson, 

 1898). Text-figure 1 (a) shows a sagittal 

 section through the cleaving egg of Crepi- 

 dula after one enteroblast has been sepa- 

 rated from the mesoblast. The ectoblast 

 has here but half covered the yolk, and 

 the entoblastic element is throwm down- 

 ward and backward in the direction in 

 which it must go if it follows the ecto- 

 derm over the yolk, and finally reaches a 

 position posterior to the blastopore as 

 that structure is closing (Conklin's fig. 

 61). In Nereis, text-figiue 1 (b), the ec- 

 toderm has advanced much farther over 

 the yolk when the enteroblasts arise, and 

 here we see that these elements are also 

 directed dowTiward but at the same time 

 anteriorly. The next and last step in 

 their change of position is illustrated by 

 Fiona, text-figure 1 (c), in which, on ac- 

 count of its invaginate gastrula, the en- 

 teroblasts are not only anteriorly directed, 

 but also at first lie higher than the cells 

 from which they arose. 



In Trochus. (Robert, 1903) the meao- 

 blast arises at about the sixty-four-cell 

 stage by a Iseotropic di\asion which sepa- 

 rates the very large cell 4d from 4D. 

 This cell divides dexiotropically and 

 equally when eighty-nine cells are present. WTien there are one hun- 

 dred and eighteen cells, each of the two derivatives of 4d divides, and 

 of the resulting four cells the anterior pair are the smaller. Later 

 the two larger posterior cells divide. Robert has not found endo- 

 dermal elements to arise from 4d,'_but does not reject the possibihty 

 of such a condition. 



As might be expected from their close relationship, a nearer corre- 

 spondence in the cleavage series is found when we compare Fiona with

Umbrella, although Heymons' conclusion regarding the fate of the 

 descendants of 4d is at wide variance with the conditions which are 

 found in Fiona. After the cleavage of 4d into equal parts, Heymons 

 states that two small cells are given off from these, so that they lie in 

 the posterior region of the macromeres. It is very evident from his 

 figures that these cells, which would correspond to E\ E- of Fiona, 

 at first lie quite dorsal to the enteron and in the cleavage cavity. The 

 large cells next divide nearly equally, the most posterior being sUghtly 

 smaller and corresponding in size and origin to m^z\ m^z^. These 

 latter shortly change their position in Umbrella exactly as in Fiona, 

 for, says Heymons, "Bald beginnt eine interessante Lagerungsver- 

 schiebung einzutreten. Es rucken namUch die hinteren Zellen welter 

 nach dem animalen Pol hin und legen sic vollkommen auf die vorderen 

 auf". While tliis rearrangement is occurring and after its completion 

 two and later other small cells are given off by the large underlying 

 cells toward the smaller cells originally budded forth. Exactly the 

 same process occurs in Fiona — compare Heymons' figs. 23 and 24 with 

 my fig. 71. Heymons' smaller cells M', M' (corresponding to m^z\ 

 m^z^ of Fiona), which have moved toward the animal pole of Umbrella, 

 do not appear from the accoimt to divide agalin so quickly as 

 in Fiona, but that they later divide teloblastically is evident. 

 As has been mentioned before, the small anterior cells of Umbrella, 

 which correspond to E^ E^. e^ e^, of Fiona, at first lie entirely mthin 

 the segmentation cavity. Figures of later stages, however (Heymons' 

 fig. 29), show that they then lie at a level with the posterior cells of the 

 enteron (D, A', C, etc.), and are directly between these and the anal 

 cells. The same relative position is taken by the corresponding cells 

 of Fiona. 



In interpreting the results of Heymons the above point of view is 

 somewhat different from the comparison of Conklin between Umbrella 

 and Crepidula, in which he suggests a resemblance and possible simi- 

 larity of origin between the enteroblasts of Crepidula and the telo- 

 blastic cells M, M, M', M', of Umbrella. In both these "are large cells 

 containing a considerable quantity of yolk, about equal in size and 

 grouped in a characteristic way" ; but the same maj^ be said of the 

 similar cells of Fiona, yet they have no part whatever in the formation 

 of the enteron, though from their appearance I was led to think such 

 might be the case before a knowledge of their later history proved 

 otherwise. The explanation of the whole matter lies in the axial 

 change which the derivatives of 4d have undergone in the forms con- 

 sidered. The posterior macromeres (particularly D) of Umbrella are 




342 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



relatively small, the same result being here obtained as in Fiona, in 

 which the entoblastic elements are produced from the anterior rather 

 than from the posterior side of the teloblasts. If any of the descend- 

 ants of 4d of Umbrella described by Heymons are entoblastic in nature 

 they are those which arise in this way, and these are the cells which 

 must be compared with the enteroblasts of Crepidida and the small 

 anterior cells in Fiona. 



Viguier (1898) describes and figiu-es the formation of the mesoderm 

 in Tethys fimhriata as similar to that of Umbrella, and a comparison of 

 figures will show almost exact correspondence. Like Heymons, 

 Viguier does not consider the derivatives of 4d to be other than meso- 

 dermal in fate. 



Carazzi (1900) derives both mesoderm and endoderm from the 

 cell 4d ("EM") of Aplysia. He states that the cleavage which forms 

 this cell is dexiotropic in direction, and such appears to be the case 

 from his figures. The cell 3A of Aplysia is larger than the others, 

 thus throwing 3D so much to the right of the median line that a dexio- 

 tropic cleavage is necessary tc place the mesentomere upon this line. 

 The divisions of 4d which follow are identical ^vith those of Fiona, but 

 Carazzi's conclusions regarding the fate of the remaining blastomeres 

 are quite different. Four pairs of small cells are derived from the two 

 large cells and lie anterior to them. These correspond in position to 

 the four (or more?) enteroblasts of Fiona, but by Carazzi are described 

 as mesodermal. Two larger cells have been given off posteriorly and 

 correspond to m^z^, m^z- of Fiona. From each of these a small cell 

 buds forth posteriorly, the two lying near the ectoderm. These small 

 cells are, according to Carazzi, enteroblasts, and go into the intestine. 

 Cells similar to these in origin and, for the time at least, in position are 

 foimd in Fiona (z\ z^) lying closely pressed against the ectoderm in 

 the posterior region of the gastrula. They are small in size, and at a 

 later time I have found it impossible to distinguish them from many 

 small mesodermal cells which crowd that region of the gastrula. If 

 they do not shift their position, they would naturally become involved 

 in the formation of the distal end of the intestine either directly, as 

 lining cells of that organ, or as muscle cells for its walls. One cannot 

 help feeling in comparing the development of the two forms and noting 

 the great similarity in the history of the early derivatives of 4d that 

 their fate is also the same ; and the same might also be said of the small 

 anterior elements w^hich Carazzi indicates as mesodermal. 



Lillie (1895) concluded that in Unio the derivatives of 4d were 

 entirely mesoblastic. The two teloblasts give origin to two small cells 




190 i.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



anteriorly which he near the enteron and are probably concerned in 

 the formation of splanchnic musculature. Similar conditions are found 

 to exist in Dreissensia , according to Meissenheimer (1901). 



Among the Pulmonates the work of Rabl (1879) is confirmed by 

 Holmes (1900), who finds that all the derivatives of the primar}- meso- 

 blast are mesoblastic in fate. More particularly he states that the 

 two bilaterally placed teloblasts give rise to a pair of small cells ante- 

 riorly, after which the large cells divide into equal moieties. Wier- 

 zejski (1897) says of Physa fortinalis, "Dass der Modus der Bildung 

 eines Theiles des Mesoderm bei Physa, desjenigen aus der Urmesoderm- 

 Zellen fast ganz derselbe ist wie ihn Heymons fiir Umbrella eingehenden 

 dargestellt". In the last stage described the mesoderm consists of 

 twelve cells, a group of six small cells anteriorly placed, behind which 

 are a pair of ''Urmesoderm-Zellen" from which they arose, while behind 

 and above lie two other rather large mesoderm cells which have given 

 oflF a pair of small cells poster! orh'. Both in sequence of origin, in 

 relative position and in size this group corresponds to the similar 

 series in Aplysia and Fiona; but Wierzejski ascribes a mesodermal 

 fate to the whole. 



In Limax Meissenheimer (1896) describes the cleavage of 4cl to a 

 stage in which there are four cells, the anterior pair of which are the 

 smaller. In fate they serve as anlagen for mesodermal struc- 

 tures. Similar conclusions were also reached by Kofoid (1895) on 

 Limax. 



Heath (1899) has accurately traced the origin of the mesoblast in 

 Ischnochiton at the seventy- two-cell stage, and its later cleavage into 

 cells of equal size which lie bilaterally. At a more advanced stage 

 two more divisions were noted giving origin to small cells dorsally and 

 anteriorly. Heath was unable to determine whether these cells were 

 purely mesodermal or partly endodermal. 



Mead (1897) describes for the Annelid Arenicola two small cells 

 budded off from the bilaterally situated pair of mesodermal cells, and 

 by further division of the large teloblasts these cells are seen later lying 

 at the ends of the mesodermal bands and appear to be mesodermal in 

 fate. The same conclusions were reached regarding Clymenella, 

 though in this case the lineage has not been traced so far. In this 

 Annelid the divisions of M\ W result in cells of nearly equal size, a 

 condition which may indicate a variation in later stages. 



In 1897 Wilson, having reinvestigated the history of the second 

 somatobla-st of Nereis, discovered that the two small cells budded from 

 the teloblasts toward the enteron, to which in his earlier paper (1892) 




344 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



a mesoblastic fate was assigned, are entoblastic in nature, and the same 

 he thinks probably to be true of Aricia and Spio. 



Child (1900) has found for Arenicola that 4d after its first cleavage 

 forms mesoblastic teloblasts, from which later arise two bilaterally- 

 placed mesoblastic bands; all these cells are mesoblastic in fate, and it 

 is evident from his figures and discussion that he does not find here any 

 entoblastic material. Though in Sternapsis the lineage was not fol- 

 lowed so far as that of Arenicola, Child reaches the same conclusion, 

 and particularly in the latter case he states that the mesoblastic cell 

 is "purely protoplasmic and -^-ithout yolk". 



In the Annehd Podarke (Treadwell, 1901) 4d arises, together with 

 the other members of the fourth quartet, at the sixty-four- cell stage 

 and is equal in size and appearance to them. It sinks inward with 

 the invagination which forms the enteron, di\'ides and lies in close 

 connection -^-ith the endodermal cells. B}^ this division from the 

 larger cells four small cells are given to the enteron. while the remaining 

 two are purely mesodermal. 



Torrey (1902), in a prehminary on the cytogeny of Thalassema, 

 assigns to the two small cells arising from the teloblasts the fate of 

 enteroblasts. in a similar manner as in the Annelids above considered. 



Segmentation of the Entoblast. 



Shortly after the origin of the mesentoblast 4d, when the egg contains 

 forty-one blastomeres, all the ''macromeres" except 4D are seen to be 

 dividing Iseotropically (fig. 24), \\-ith the result that three large cells, 

 4a, 4b. 4c, are given off from their respective macromeres. These 

 cells are slightly greater in size than those centrally grouped, but are 

 not so large as the cell 4d, and on this accoimt we find that of the four 

 cells, 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D, the last is the smallest, nor does it again 

 divide mitil over one hmidred and fifty blastomeres are present. 

 The position of the fourth quartet ma}" be seen in fig. 25 and 

 those following. When the egg contains over eighty blastomeres, 

 4A, 4B and 4C again divide into equal moieties, the outer three of which 

 (5a, 5b, 5c) lie to the right of the central group. All these cells have 

 become much flattened and form a comparatively thin roof over the 

 segmentation ca\'ity, into which as 3-et invagination has not begim. 

 The mesentoderm has simken completely beneath the external layer 

 and extends forward as far as the center of the ca\-ity (figs. 45, 57). 

 At a much later period, when there are nearly one himdred and fifty 

 cells present, 4a, 4b and 4c again di\dde (figs. 71, 72, 73), giving off 

 small cells to the left and outwardly (4a\. 4b\, 4c^). The invagination 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 345 



to form the enteron has ah-eady begun by the depression of the smaller 

 cells which lie in the center of the vegetative pole, while the small cells, 

 E\ E^, e\ e^, at the anterior end of the teloblasts have become drawn 

 into the posterior region of the invagination (except for some varia- 

 tion, an instance of which is shown in fig. 72), where at this time they 

 help to close that portion of the gastral pit. As the primary enteric 

 cells sink into the cleavage cavity the small cells, E^, E-, e\ e^, come 

 into close connection with the posterior edges of 5C, 5D, 4a. Thus a 

 more or less complete cup-like invagination is brought about among 

 the entomeres, in which the smaller elements lie at the bottom with 

 the larger (4a^, 4b^, 4c^) between, and the small cells which have arisen 

 from these latter lying peripheral to them. Above, toward the ven- 

 tral siu-face, lie small cells of the second and third quartets around the 

 blastopore opening. 



In the formation of the enteric cells the manner in which the fourth 

 quartet arises appears to be characteristic of a number of Opistho- 

 branchs. This quartet is in Umbrella (Heymons, 1893), Aplysia 

 (Blochmann, 1883; Carazzi, 1900) and Tethijs (Viguier, 1898), as weU 

 as in Fiona, larger than the macromeres remaining at the center of 

 the vegetative pole. 



The further development of the enteron will be discussed later. 



Cleavage History of the Ectomeres. 



As has been seen, the ectoblast arises immediately after the four- 

 cell stage by the three successively alternating cleavages in which the 

 macromeres participate, giving rise respectively to the First, Second 

 and Third Quartets of micromeres. The cleavage history of these 

 cells will now be taken up and their ultimate fate, as far as can be 

 determined, considered. 



The First Quartet. 



The formation of the "turrets," la^-ld^, and the "apicals," la^-ld^, 

 leading to the radially symmetrical twenty-four-cell stage, has already 

 been considered. Shortly afterward the apical cells divide in a dexio- 

 tropic direction, thus alternating with the preceding cleavage, and by 

 this division the four "basal" cells of the ectoblastic cross arise, while 

 between these and the central point of the egg lie the four small apical 

 cells from which they were derived (fig. 23). Before this cleavage had 

 occurred the upper and dextral cells of the second quartet had in each 

 quadrant given off a small cell in a laeotropic direction (fig. 21), which 




346 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



after the formation of the basals occupj^ positions just peripheral to 

 them and slightly to the left. These four small second quartet ele- 

 ments are the "tip" cells of the cross, 2a"-2d", and together with the 

 basals and apicals form the ectoblastic cross. 



From the time of its formation and vmtil a late period of cleavage 

 the cross of Fiona is a distinctly dexiotropic structure, the apicals of the 

 four arms lying to the right of their respective tips. The cross is thus 

 at the time of its formation (fig. 23) composed of twelve cells, of which 

 the apicals are the central, is radially symmetrical and its anterior and 

 posterior arms lie very near to, if not exactly in, the median plane of 

 the future embryo. In the futiu-e history of this structure the tip 

 cells will for convenience be described in connection with the rest of the 

 cross, since they are so closely connected with it. 



Before further cleavage occurs in the first quartet the second and 

 third quartets and the macromeres show marked karyokinetic activity, 

 the number of cells in the egg having increased to nearly sixty. The 

 basal cells and the turret cells or trochoblasts then divide simultaneously 

 (fig. 33), though considerable variation in time occurs in different eggs 

 and in different quadrants, it being, however, imiversally observed 

 that Id^^ divides last of the basals. It may be noted in this connection 

 that in all species of Crepidula examined except C. adunca the division 

 in the basal cell of the posterior arm is delayed for a much longer period. 

 The direction of cleavage of the basals Id^^ and Ib*^ is laeotropic and 

 so alternating with the last, those of the other two doubtful; la" 

 usually shows a Iseeotropic to radial position of spindle, while in Ic" 

 variations are present all the way from Iseotropic to dexiotropic. After 

 examining a large number of eggs the occurrence of this irregularity 

 was more strongly confirmed, and it thus appears that in this cell, 

 Ic", there is a strong tendency, more marked in some cases than in 

 others, toward non-alternation with resulting bilaterality of cleavage 

 in relation to its opposite cell, la^^ In Crepidula, Plaiiorbis and Neri- 

 tina the cleavage of all these basal cells is non-alternating, while in 

 Umbrella it is regularly alternating. 



In Fiona it would appear that we have an intermediate condition in 

 which, though regular alternation is foimd in the anterior and posterior 

 basal cells, the two lateral, particularly Ic^', show a tendency toward 

 non-alternation under the influence of approaching bilaterality. It 

 is just at this time that the first distinctly bilateral cleavages occur in 

 two cells of the third quartet in the two posterior quadrants, 3d^ and 

 3c^ (figs. 31, 32), and this suggestion of bilateral divisions of the cross 

 may be correlated with them. How^ever, the influence toward bilater- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



ality must be very slight, as the radial symmetry of the upper pole is 

 not disturbed to any appreciable degree. 



By the divisions of the basal cells above described each arm of the 

 cross is composed of four cells — an outer tip cell (2a"-2d"), next to it 

 the ''middle" cell (W'-^-lcV^-), an inner "basal" cell {U'-'-lcV-'), which 

 is larger than its sister middle cell, and an apical (la"-ld"). 



Synchronously with the cleavage of the basals occurs that of the 

 turrets, the cell of this series in each quadrant dividing into two of 

 nearly equal size, the outer being the smaller. All divisions are 

 dexiotropic and alternating with those bv which these cells arose 

 (fig. 33). 



Comparing the cleavage of the turrets with conditions foimd in other 

 forms, it will be noted that considerable variation exists. While in 

 Fiona these cells divide when there are about sixty blastomeres in 

 the whole egg, in Umbrella (Hcymons) approximately seventy are 

 present; like Fiona all four turrets divide at relatively the same time. 

 In Crepidula the anterior trochoblasts do not divide until there are 

 over one hundred cells in the egg, and Conklin states that he believes 

 the posterior ones never divide. The trochoblasts of Trochus (Robert) 

 arise very early, at the sixteen-cell stage, and have all divided when 

 there are thirty-two cells present. In Planorbis Holmes finds them in 

 division at about forty cells, and Limax (Kofoid) shows a similar con- 

 dition. In thiio (Lillie) there are about fifty cells, while in Ischno- 

 chiton (Heath) but thirty-two, when the "primary trochoblasts" of the 

 latter form divide. Thus Fiona appears to occupy an intermediate 

 position in relation to these and other molluscan forms in which the 

 time of cleavage of these cells has been determined. 



Division next occurs in the cross at a stage of about eighty-four 

 cells and results in the division of the apicals into eight small cells, 

 of which those lying centrally form the "apical rosettes" (la"^-kP"), 

 while the outer series are the "peripheral rosettes" (la"^-ld"^) of 

 Conklin. Direction of cleavage is Isotropic, and of the resulting cells the 

 outer are the larger (PI. XXVH, fig. 53). Shortly after the rosette series 

 are established the basal cells of all arms divide again, the posterior 

 one last. In the anterior quadrant the spindle and resulting cells, 

 Ib'^" and Ib^^^-, lie radially in the lateral arms, the division of Ic^^' is 

 Iseotropic, that of la^^^ dexiotropic, again showing bilateral influence, 

 while in kP"^ the spindle is so strongly turned in heotropic direction 

 that the resulting cells lie transversely across the posterior arm (figs. 

 56, 62). While this last cleavage of the basals is being accomplished 

 a similar process is seen in the four inner trochoblasts (la-*-ld-^), result- 




348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



ing in eight cells of equal size and occurring at relatively the same time 

 in all four quadrants. 



With the completion of the above-described divisions the large num- 

 ber of cells of similar size at the upper pole of the egg makes their exact 

 lineage difficult to follow, so that it is desirable to make here some com- 

 parisons with the s.tructure and development of the cross and trocho- 

 blasts in other forms, and to bring together the results already obtained 

 before proceeding to more uncertain ground. In formation the cross 

 of Fiona arises in the same manner as in Umbrella and Planorhis, by 

 the completion of the tip cells before the basals; and in this it differs 

 from Neritina and Crepidula, where the tip arises shortly after division 

 has occurred to form the four basal cells. In Trochus the tips are 

 relatively late in appearing, as the basals have completed their cleavage 

 before these cells arise. At the first cleavage of the basals another 

 striking similarity to Umbrella is found, for in this Opisthobranch the 

 cleavage is Iseotropic, while in Crepidula and Neritina it is dexiotropic, 

 thus breaking the law of alternating cleavages ; and likewise in Planorbis 

 with reversed type the division is Iseotropic and non-alternating vnth 

 the preceding. Trochus shows an extremely marked Iseotropic division 

 of these cells, so much so, in fact, that the resulting cells lie almost 

 transversely. In Fiona the anterior and posterior basals are distinctly 

 Iseotropic in origin and so regularly alternating, while considerable varia- 

 tion is found in the lateral arms, a radial type often occurring with Ic^^ 

 sometimes showing a decided dexiotropic direction of spindle. It 

 would appear from this variation in the lateral arms that Fiona shows 

 tendencies toward bilateraUty in the first quartet at this time, and such 

 a condition would be in harmony with the bilateral cleavages of the 

 third quartet cells, 3c^ and Sd\ occurring just previously. However, 

 the radial symmetry of the cross as a whole appears not to be dis- 

 turbed appreciably, so that though these variations may show either a 

 tendency toward bilaterality or toward entire reversal in all quadrants, 

 as is found in Neritina, Crepidida and Planorbis, this influence has not 

 as yet become sufficiently marked to affect the radial symmetry of 

 the upper pole of the egg to any appreciable degree. In discussing the 

 lack of alternation of these cleavages in Crepidula as opposed to alter- 

 nation in Umbrella, Conldin suggests "upon this difference the future 

 recognizability of the cross in the last-named cases {Crepidula and 

 Neritina) depends". In Umbrella the Iseotropic division of the basals 

 is much more marked than in Fiona, but even in the latter case Conk- 

 lin's prediction is in part, at least, fulfilled, as the cross of Fiona, after 

 a slightly older stage than thus far described, becomes so irregular that 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 349 



its component cells are neither among themselves distinguishable nor 

 may they be definitely separated from the surrounding blastomeres. 

 Of coimse, this is largel}^ due to the multiplication of the trochoblasts 

 and the similarity in size of most of the cells upon the upper surface of 

 the egg, yet the Inotropic twist given to the basal elements at their 

 initial cleavage is largely responsible for that irregularity of contour 

 which so early marks the outlines of the cross. The peripheral ends 

 of the arms of the cross of Fiona become strongly twisted to the left, 

 and as the structure becomes older the ends tend to bend around in 

 that direction to a marked degree, greatly confusing their component 

 cells with those arising by multiplication of the trochoblasts. Up to 

 the stage shown in fig. 53 the cross has, with the exception of a slight 

 tendency toward variation in the first division of the basals, been 

 radially symmetrical, but at the next cleavage of the basals the cell 

 of this series in the posterior arm divides so that its daughter cells 

 lie transverse to the longitudinal axis of this arm. In the anterior 

 quadrant this division produces cells which lie radially, while in C 

 quadrant the cleavage is Iseotropic, in A dexiotropic. 



The first indication of transverse splitting of the arms is thus seen 

 to occur in the basal cell of the posterior quadrant. In Crepidula the 

 reverse is the case, the anterior and lateral arms alone increasing in 

 width, while the posterior later elongates by radial cleavages. In Fiona 

 all the arms become longitudinally split at a later period. The inner 

 and outer rosettes have not yet arisen in Crepidula when the splitting 

 begins in the cells, la-b-c^-, while in Fiona chey are present and the 

 egg contains many more cells, the basal cells of the anterior and lateral 

 arms having again divided in such a manner that these arms are length- 

 ened before increase in breadth occurs. The same is true of Pkmorbis. 

 The early splitting of the arms of the cross in Crepidula is probably in 

 part due, as Holmes suggests, to the fact that, through pressure, they 

 have become much wider and tend to divide in a direction opposite to 

 this elongation. It mJght also be suggested that the extreme breadth 

 of the cross of Crepidula and the early transverse division of its anterior 

 and lateral arms may be correlated with the presence of a large amount 

 of yolk which must be covered by the ectoblast, while in the posterior 

 region the extensive multiplication of the elements of the second quar- 

 tet obviates the necessary broadening of the arm which reaches in that 

 direction. 



The transverse cleavage of the anterior and lateral arms of the cross 

 of Fiona occurs shortly after the initiation of a similar process in the 

 posterior arm, but it has been found impossible to trace the lineage 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



of all the cells accurately though, after lateral extension has occurred, 

 the structure may be demarkated from the trochoblasts and underlying 

 second quartet cells. In fig. 75 its structure and probably cell deri- 

 vation may be seen. Holmes finds for Planorbis that the tip cells 

 divide in a transverse direction first, while in Crepidula the middle 

 cells are the first to cleave. The tips appear to divide last in Fiona. 

 In the posterior arms after the first transverse division most of the cells 

 divide obliquely across the arms, and in this way the arm becomes longer 

 than the other three. While the cross is increasing in lateral extension 

 the outer turret cells of all quadrants divide, so that the four groups 

 each consist of four cells of equal size (fig. 75) lying in the angles 

 formed by the arms of the cross. 



The apical pole of the egg at this period shows a slight depression 

 in the region of the rosette series. It is but transient and disappears 

 with the elongation of the gastrula. A similar depression has been 

 observed in Neritina, Crepidula and Trochus. Whether the structure 

 is normal in Fiona is yet doubtful. Robert insists that such is the case 

 with Trochus. 



The entire formation of the cross of Trochus is peculiar. The basals 

 have arisen and divided before the tips appear, and this division of 

 the basals is so directly Iseotropic as to be practically transverse. At 

 the next cleavage these two cells form an oblong group of four in each 

 arm. The tips which lie peripherally to these groups next divide, 

 the cleavages of 2a" and 2c" being bilateral, the first of this nature to 

 occur in the egg. 



From the cases cited above of the manner of formation of the 

 ectoblastic cross of Mollusks, it will be seen that this characteristic 

 structure shows great diversity of details throughout the group, 

 though fimdamental similarity is evident. Some of the probable 

 causes of such variation are (1) varying amounts of yolk, leading 

 to early lateral extension of the arms in those forms possessing 

 yolk-ladened entomeres, and (2) differences in the manner and rate 

 of development of the trochoblasts, correlated with the later structure 

 and functional importance of the locomotor organ to which they 

 largely give rise. The radial arrangement of blastomeres around the 

 apical pole of the cleaving egg is primarily the result of successively 

 alternating spiral cleavages, and a similar arrangement may be expected 

 in eggs which exhibit this mode of division. A definitely marked cross 

 does not always arise from such an. arrangement of blastomeres, as, 

 for example, in Polyclad cleavage, so that this but suffices as a partial 

 explanation. Regarding the form of the crosses of Mollusks and 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 351 



Annelids Conklin says: "The cross and rosette series are the direct 

 residt of the position, size and shape of their constituent cells". The 

 original position of cells resulting from regularly alternating spiral 

 cleavages is a function of that mode of division. The shape of cells 

 depends largely upon the relations which they bear to one another. 

 Their size is not so easily explained, and upon this factor depends, to a 

 large extent, the varying forms of crosses met with in different in- 

 stances. If it be supposed that the original arrangement of the upper 

 pole cells of Mollusk and AnneUd eggs was radial in form, the modifi- 

 cations which have arisen in the two groups may, in part at least, be 

 referred directly to the size of the cells comprising that area. The 

 importance and early development of the trochoblasts of Annelids 

 has resulted in encroachment upon that area which in the segmenting 

 eggs of these forms corresponds to the cross region of Mollusks. As a 

 result the ''intermediate" series of Annelids, corresponding to the 

 moUuscan cross cells, lack the prominence characteristic of the same 

 cells in the latter group. Moreover, it is interesting to note that such 

 a Mollusk as Ischnochiton, which in the development of its trocho- 

 blasts and prototroch shows a condition intermediate between Mol- 

 lusks and Annelids, also exhibits a cross which is intermediate in 

 character. Though the trochoblasts have been taken here as an ex- 

 ample of the influence which variation in size or rate of division may 

 have upon the primitive arrangement of blastomeres in the spirally 

 cleaving egg, it is doubtless true that other cells may in like manner 

 undergo modifications which will result in similar rearrangements. 



Thus it may be concluded that the group of cells constituting the 

 cross owes its radial arrangement primarily to the form of cleavages 

 by which it arose, but that the cross as a definitely marked structure 

 is the result of variations in the size, shape and rate of division of the 

 cells comprising or surrounding it, these variations leading, on the one 

 hand, to the formation of the moUuscan cross: on the other, to the 

 annelid an. 



Second Quartet. 



While the egg is yet radially symmetrical and its blastomeres num- 

 ber twenty-four, the original second quartet cell of each quadrant has 

 divided in a dexiotropic direction into cells of equal size.- After the 

 mesentoblast has arisen, but before the basal cells of the cross are 

 formed, all of the second quartet cells divide in a Iseotropic direction, 

 the upper four giving off the four tip cells (2a"-2d") toward the upper 

 pole, while the lower four give origin to small cells resembling the 




352 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



tips in size, which are directed toward the vegetative pole (PI. XXIII, 

 figs. 21, 22, 23, PI. XXIV, fig. 24). 



The second quartet at this time consists of four similar groups of 

 cells, each group consisting of two large cells, 2a^^-2d^2 and 2a2i-2d-\ 

 lying together, with the smaller cells above and below. The two large 

 cells in all four quadrants, 2a^2_2di2^ 2si'^^-2d^\ next divide almost 

 simultaneously. The direction of cleavage of the right upper colls 

 (2a^--2d^^) is dexiotropic, and of the resulting cells the upper (2a^-'- 

 2di20 are slightly larger than the lower {2si^^^-2cV^^) , the divisions being 

 identical in all four quadrants. Synchronously with these divisions 

 cleavage spindles appear in the other large cells of the second quartet 

 (2a2^-2d2^). Of the resulting cells the lower are much the smaller. 

 In direction the cleavages are probably all laeotropic and therefore 

 non-alternating, though in C and D quadrants the spindles are almost 

 meridional in position, and the cleavages horizontal. Figures 28, 29, 

 30, 31 and 32 show these divisions in the different quadrants. 



The lack of alternation found in the above instance may be explained 

 as the direct result of the relative sizes of the foregoing derivatives of 

 the second quartet and the positions in which they lie. By an exami- 

 nation of fig. 30 it will be seen that should the two large cells, 2c^^ and 

 2c^^ have divided in the same direction a diagonal row of cells would 

 have been the result, with great pressure against one another and upon 

 the cells in the first and third quartets at the ends of the row. Lack 

 of alternation in direction of cleavage in one of the cells would relieve 

 this pressm-e, and this is the actual condition found. Such an expla- 

 nation appears to fit this individual case of non-alternation, but no 

 generalization may be made, as in many other instances the cleavage 

 of blastomeres appears to follow no rules of mutual pressure and can 

 be explained on no grounds so simple. 



Division again occurs in this quartet at a stage of about eighty cells 

 and great variation in time is marked in their occurrence. 



The following table shows the average sequence observed in the 

 different quadrants, though any one egg may show marked variation 

 from the tabulated result: 




1904. 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



353 



The table should be read : In A quadrant 2a^^ cleaves first, 2a^" second, 

 22^"^ third and 2d?^'^ fourth. In B quadrant, etc. Cleavages in A 

 quadrant are found in figs. 50, 58 and 63; in B, figs. 52 and 59; in C, 

 figs. 44, 48, 54, 60 and 65; in D, figs. 47, 51 and 61. 



The divisions of 2a^^^-2d^^^ are laeotropic in all quadrants, of 2a"^-2d^" 

 universally dexiotropic, of 2a^^-2d2^ everywhere dexiotropic, while 

 variation is found in the direction of cleavage in the cells 2a"2-2d*^^. 

 Of these latter a decidedly laeotropic direction is found in B quadrant, 

 horizontal to dexiotropic in D, horizontal to laeotropic in A and ap- 

 proximately horizontal in C. With regard to the size of the derivative 

 cells, it may be said in a general way that variation is evident. More 

 particularly considered the following conditions are found to prevail. 

 The divisions of 2a^\ 2c^S 2d^^ result in cells of equal size, while in 

 the case of 2b^^ the upper cell 2b^2ii jg j^uch smaller than 2b^2i2. 2a2ii, 

 2b2", 2d"" form upper small and lower larger parts, while 2c^" divides 

 equally; 2b^^, 2c^^, and 2d^^ show similar divisions into upper small 

 and lower large cells, while 2a^^^ remains so long undivided that its 

 derivatives are imcertain ; 2QP'^-2d.^'^'^ divide equally. 



As a result of the foregoing cleavages the second quartet contains 

 in all approximately forty cells. The irregularities which have char- 

 acterized the preceding divisions are increased in number as cleavage 

 continues, though imtil a much later period all four quadrants show 

 relatively the same number of cells for this quartet. If figs. 67-70, 

 representing the different sides of the same egg, be examined it will 

 be seen that in A quadrant 2a^^^ has divided dexiotropically, while 

 2a^"^ has divided horizontally; quadrant B shows no further multi- 

 pUcation of elements ; in C quadrant, 2c^^" is in process of division, while 

 2c2"^ and 2c2"2 j^g^^g i^q^j^ given off small cells toward the upper pole; 

 D quadrant remains as before.

354 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



At a stage in which there are six cells of the second quartet in each 

 quadrant in Crepidula these groups very closely resemble the similar 

 ones of Fiona. When there are four cells in each group in Crepidula 

 the larger middle pair divide and, as in Fiona, one of them shows lack of 

 alternation ; but in Crepidula the direction of the cleavage is slightly 

 Iseotropic in the right cell and dexiotropic in the left, while just the 

 opposite is true of Fiona. Planorhis shows a group of second quartet 

 cells in each quadrant, which may be said in this sinistral form to be 

 almost the mirrored image of the same cells of Fiona, though the tips 

 and the corresponding cells at the lower pole are somewhat larger in 

 Planorhis, which probably accounts for their earlier division in that 

 form. The large second quartet cells of Trochus, as in Fiona, show 

 lack of alternation in the left cells of the series (2a^^-2d^^), while the 

 right (2a^2-2d^) show regular alternation. The early cleavages in the 

 second quartet of Tethys (Viguier, 1898) closely parallel those of 

 the same series in Fiona. Viguier has mistaken the lower elements of 

 this quartet, 2a^^-2d^^, for members of the fourth, as Robert has pointed 

 out. Further note of the errors in this paper will not be taken here, 

 since they have been so thoroughly discussed by Robert. Heymons 

 (1893) for Umbrella shows the second quartet series up to a stage of 

 six cells in each quadrant, and here also similar conditions are found. 

 Carazzi (1900) figures the egg of Aplysia, where each quadrant contains 

 four second quartet cells, and here also is a marked similarity to the 

 other forms considered. The second quartet of Fiona maintains a 

 radial symmetry for a much longer period than Planorhis, this being 

 the result of similar cleavages in all four quadrants for a much later 

 period than in that Pulmonate. The same may be said of Umhrella 

 and Crepidula, and, as Holmes sifggests, this phenomenon is probably 

 correlated with the earlier development and larger size of the head 

 vesicle of Planorhis than of the corresponding structure of Crepidula, 

 Umbrella or Fiona. 



The Third Quartet. 



Of the three quartets the third is the first to show evidences of 

 bilateral divisions. When the egg has cleaved into twenty-four 

 blastomeres this c^uartet has but one cell in each quadrant, and these 

 cells do not divide until after the second cleavage of the second quartet. 

 They then all divide in a Iseotropic direction, but the resulting cells 

 are not of the same size in the different quadrants. 3a and 3b produce 

 cells of equal size, while 3c and 3d give rise to small cells in the direction 

 of the vegetative . pole with very large ones above, thus forming an 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 355 



additional landmark for distinguishing anterior from posterior quad- 

 rants (PI. XXIV, fig. 25). The larger cells of the posterior quadrants, 

 3e* and 3d\ divide [next; the spindle in 3e^ being dexiotropic and 

 alternating, that of 3d^ laeotropic and non-alternating; and this lack 

 of alternation in one of the large cells of the third quartet, taken in 

 coimection with the regular alternation of the similar cell on the oppo- 

 site side of the posterior region of the egg, establishes the first bilat- 

 eral cleavage (PL XXV, figs. 31, 32,34). Both upper and lower cells 

 of A and B quadrants are the next third quartet elements to divide, 

 the direction in all cases being dexiotropic or in some instances nearly- 

 meridional (figs. 37, 40, 41). The lower cells, 3a- and 3b-, always divide 

 before the upper, 3a^ and Sh\ and in all cases cleavage is equal, a group 

 of four similar cells arising in each of the two anterior quadrants. 

 In the posterior quadrants cleavage occurs next in 3d^-, 3d", 3c*2 and 

 3c". It wall be remembered that when these cells were formed it was 

 through a Iseotropic and non-alternating division of 3d* and a dexio- 

 tropic and alternating division of 3c\ thus producing a bilateral cleav- 

 age of similar cells of opposite sides. Now the cells 3c" and 3c*^ 

 again divide dexiotropically, thus showing lack of alternation, while 

 3d" and 3d*^ again exhibit distinct Iseotropic cleavage and a second 

 failure to alternate. Thus arise in each posterior quadrant two very 

 small cells, 3c"-, 3c^" and 3d"2, 3d*", lying below the large ones, 3c"*, 

 3c*2\ 3d*** and 3d*-* (PI. XXVT, figs.^ 43, 44, 45, 47). After these 

 cleavages about eighty blastomeres are present (figs. 67, etc.). When 

 this number has increased to slightly over a hundred, 3a-*, 3a-^, 3b^* 

 and 3b^^, each gives off a small cell toward the vegetative pole by cleav- 

 ages which appear horizontal (PI. XXVII, figs. 57, 59), and these divi- 

 sions are followed by equal and probably horizontal cleavages in the 

 posterior quadrants of the large cells, 3c***, 3d*** and 3c*-* and 3d*^*, 

 the former pair always dividing before the latter (figs. 61, 66), so that 

 each posterior group contains seven cells, of which three are small 

 and lie nearest the blastopore, being bounded externally by four large 

 cells, 3c****, ***2, *2", 12*2, and 3d****, ***2, *2**, *2*2 respectively. ' 



The history of the third cjuartet of Fiona thus far given adds another 

 to the number of Mollusks in which it has been found that bilateral 

 cleavages first appear in the posterior quadrant, and more particularly 

 in the cells of the third quartet. 



The initial divisions of these cells in Umbrella appear from Heymons' 

 description to be nearly radial, but his figures show that in the case of 

 3c and 3(1 cleavage is lieotrr)pic. The lower products of these cleavages 

 are all smaller than the upper, in which they parallel only the posterior 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April. 



quadrant cells of Fiona. Moreover, these cells, 3c^ and 3d^, divide 

 again before the anterior ones as in Fiona, and these clea\'ages are the 

 first bilateral divisions described. It woidd appear from Heymons' 

 figures that the two cells next the median plain lie higher than the 

 outer, and this is the condition found in Fiona. If such be the case, 

 these two forms stand in contradistinction to Crepidula, in which the 

 median pair are the lower. The cells 3c", 3d" are the protoblasts 

 of Heymons' excretory cells, and it will be seen later that 3c" serves 

 a similar purpose in Fiona. It is interesting to note that Conklin says 

 of 3c" and 3d" that they are "large and clear" and "have the same 

 characteristics in Crepidula" , though he does not know their fate. 

 Heymons describes divisions at a later stage in the anterior quadrants, 

 while in the posterior 3c" and 3c^^, 3d" and 3d^^ give rise by horizontal 

 divisions to small cells which he next to 3c- and 3d- — these latter in 

 exact correspondence with Fiona. 



Of this quartet Holmes says of PZanorfcts; "The first cleavage forms 

 a transition from the spiral to the bilateral type, and subsequent 

 cleavages show a bilateral character in a more marked degree. 

 At nearly the same time the lower pair of cells in the two anterior 

 quadrants and the upper pair of cells in the posterior quadrants divide 

 in a nearly horizontal direction into equal moieties. Later the upper 

 pair of ceUs in the anterior quadrants divide in the same direction as 

 the lower pair. The lower pair of cells in the two posterior quad- 

 rants remain undivided until a much later stage". These divisions 

 closely follow those of Fiona, and the same may be said of subse- 

 quent ones. 



In Aplysia (Carazzi) the two third quartet cells of each anterior 

 ■quadrant divide into equal moieties, while in the posterior quadrants 

 small cells are given off toward the vegetative pole ; the same is true 

 of Fiona. At the next divisions of 3c^ and 3d^ "si di\'idono con fusi 

 transversali, cioe con divisione bilaterale," while 3a^ and 3b^ remain at 

 jest. Viguier (1898) for Tethys describes the initial division of all 

 the four quartet cells as "suivant des plans sensiblement radiaux", 

 the resulting two cells in each quadrant being equal. Later cleavages 

 of this quartet in Fiona will be considered under the discussion of 

 gastrulation and secondary mesoderm formation. Bilaterality appears 

 late in the cleavage of Trochus. The first divisions of this natiu-e do 

 not occur until the ninety-seven-cell stage, and are concerned with the 

 cells 2c" and 2a". This is the first violation of Sachs-Hert^dg's law 

 of alternatingly perpendicular cleavages. The cleavages of the third 

 quartet are very tardy in this Prosobranch, for when there are as manj- 




1904,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



as one hundred and fifty cells present this quartet consists of but four 

 cells in each quadrant. 



Gastrulatiox. 



With the beginning of gastrulation, marked differences appear in 

 the cleavages of the quadrants and the radial symmetry of the egg as 

 a whole gives place to a more and more distinct bilaterality. In 

 the posterior region, particularly among the cells of the second quartet, 

 great divisional activity and growth takes place ; while the same series 

 in A, C and B quadrants show relatively slight increase when compared 

 with the derivatives of 2d. It has been impossible to follow the line- 

 age, except in particular instances, from the time these cleavages 

 begin, as most of the cells of the gastrula of Fiona are so similar in 

 size and appearance and the number becomes so great that individual 

 identification is limited to special cases. However, by continued 

 observation of successively developing stages one becomes famihar 

 A\-ith the cell groups which will later give rise to various organs and, 

 aided by a few landmarks, may in most cases follow the organogeny 

 T\-ith approximate if not absolute certainty. 



An examination of figs. 69 and 70 will show that 2b^=^- and 2b2"2 

 have divided again, and shortly afterward cleavage occurs in a num- 

 ber of other cells, 2b2-, 2b-"^ etc. The upper cells of the third quartet 

 in the anterior quadrants lie at first well toward the upper surface, 

 but as invagination proceeds these move around toward the lower side, 

 while an increasing number of second quartet elements are found sepa- 

 rating the first from the third quartet at the anterior as well as the 

 posterior end of the gastrula. Meanwhile the second quartet cells 

 in the median posterior region (derivatives of 2d) have multiphed very 

 rapidly, and b}^ causing increase in the surface area of the gastrula in 

 this region have pushed the apical pole several degrees forward. Not 

 only have the posterior second quartet cells increased in numbers but 

 also in size, marking out at an early period the region from which the 

 shell gland will develop. The second quartet groups which lie laterally 

 below the ends of the lateral arms of the cross also grow in extent and 

 numbers, this being more particularly true of those which abut upon 

 the enlarging cells of the same series in D quadrant. 



The historj' of the third quartet has thus far been followed to a stage 

 when its members in each anterior quadrant number six, of which 

 four are large and two small cells, while in each posterior quadrant the 

 group comprises seven cells, three of which are small and four large. 

 By approximately horizontal cleavages of the upper cells in the two 




358 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



anterior quadrants four cells of equal size are formed in each quadrant, 

 and as the blastopore continues to narrow these cells migrate as a 

 group in each of the two anterior quadrants, approaching the blasto- 

 pore and slipping over the cells 3b^" and Sh-^K 3a^" and 3a-^^, which lie 

 between them and the smaller cells of the same series (PI. XXIX, 

 figs. 68, 69). During this period the third quartet blastomeres of the 

 posterior cjuadrants remain as before. 



The blastopore thus becomes entirely surrounded by the second and 

 third quartet elements, of which the third are much more nimierous, 

 having the small cells 2a---2d-^ or their derivatives wedged in between 

 them on the median and transverse line. The gastrula, taken as a 

 whole, is much flattened dorso-ventrally and is at first shorter in its 

 longitudinal than transverse axis. The blastopore assumes a slit-like 

 form, its longitudinal axis corresponding to the future longitudinal 

 axis of the embryo. 



The next important change to be observed is the origin of the 



Edo-Mesoblast. 



As the cells 3a"\, "-, '~\ '" and 3b"S "-, '-\ ^" continue to move 

 toward the blastopore, the cells which they are covering over 3a^", 

 3a^^^ and 3b^", 3b^^\ sink downward into the segmentation cavity. 

 As this occurs they all four divide, giving rise externally and in the 

 direction of the blastopore to four small cells, 3a2"2, 3a^^^^ and 3b^"^, 

 3)32212^ while the larger daughter cells continue to retreat beneath 

 the overgrowing ectoderm (fig. 74). These larger cells, 3a-"^, 3a^2", 

 3b^^^^ and 3b^^", are the source from which the secondary mesoderm 

 is derived. They later divide, as may be seen in fig. 78, and begin at 

 once to form two bands of several cells each, which lie in the antero- 

 lateral region of the gastrula and later in the anterior head region of the 

 larva. 



Since the discovery by Lillie in 1895 of mesoderm which arose from 

 the ectoderm in the Lamellibranch Uniq, various other cell-lineage 

 workers have arrived at similar conclusions concerning other forms. 

 As is well known, Lillie found that the larval musculature of the Glo- 

 chidium arose from a cell of the second quartet, 2a, which in cleavage 

 gives rise to a cell toward the segmentation cavity, the descendants of 

 which are mesodermal in fate. Conklin's results, published in 1897, 

 gave evidence that in the Gasteropod Crepidula ectodermal mesoderm 

 arose in three quadrants, in this case also from the second quartet (2a, 

 2b and 2c), but appearing much later then the "larval mesoblast" of 

 Lillie, so late, in fact, that the exact cell origin could not be traced.

NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



359 



In 1S97 Wierzejski showed that in the sinistral Pulmonate Physa sec- 

 ondary mesoblast arises from certain derivatives of the third quartet 

 (3c and 3b), and similar conclusions were reached in the same year for 

 Planorbis by Holmes. 3c and 3b here also giving rise to cells which sink 

 into the segmentation cavit}'. 



The formation of the secondary mesoderm in Fiona is strikingly 

 similar to its manner of origin in PUniorbis, as described by Holmes. 

 The following diagram (text-figure 2). showing the cleavage history of 

 the ectomesomeres of the two forms, indicates how close a comparison 

 is possible. 



Fig. 2. — Diagrams showing the manner of formation of secondary mesoderm 

 in (a) Planorbis (Holmes) and (6) Physa (Wierzejski) and Fiona. The cells 

 containing secondary- mesoderm are stippled. 



It will be noted that four cells of each anterior quadrant are meso- 

 dermal in Planorbis, while in Fiona only two have this fate, the 

 smaller cells. 3a-^^, --^, and 3b-^^-, ^^-. of Fiona remaining in the ecto- 

 derm. For Physa Wierzejski came to similar conclusions, but here 

 there is even closer correspondence, for the cells 3b-"-, ^^ and 3c-^", --'- 

 of Physa remain in the ectoderm exactly as they do in Fiona. Accord- 

 ing to the nomenclature used bj' these two investigators secondary 

 mesoblast arises from quadrant B and C, while in the dextrall}' clea\-ing 

 egg of Fio7ia it comes from quadrant A and B. Holmes and Wierzejski 

 have attempted to use the same sequence of lettering for sinistral 

 forms as that commonly employed for the dextral. and have thus been 

 led into error, Holmes particularly arguing for a non-homology of 

 cells upon this score, ^\^len the dextral or clock-wise sequence is 

 employed for a sinistral form this difference in designation necessarily 

 results if the cell which is to give rise to the entomesoblast be labelled 

 D. The more natiu-al and logical method is to label the cells of a 

 sinistral form in an anti-clock-wise sequence, as Cramptcn (1894) has 




360 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



very wisely done for Physa. Robert (1903), iii his excellent paper on 

 the development of Trochus, wliich has just reached this laboratory, 

 calls attention to the above and confirms opinions which had already 

 been embodied in this paper. Animals which are sinistral, or reversed 

 in their larval and adult stages, develop from eggs which are hkewise 

 reversed in their cleavage, and the designation of the blastomeres of 

 the egg should coincide with the condition of the adult, if any homology 

 of cells exists. The eggs of sinistral Gastropods have probably at an 

 early stage in their ovarian development undergone complete cyto- 

 plasmic and nuclear inversion, for only by such a process can the 

 reversed condition of the larv£e and adults be understood or the reversal 

 of direction of the cleavage spindles be explained, and if such an inver- 

 sion be postulated, corresponding reversal of sequence in nomencla- 

 ture must ensue. 



Meissenheimer (1901) describes in Dreissensia a cell Ij^ng in the 

 cleavage cavity just under the First Somatoblast derivatives, but 

 which, he says, does not come from this group, though he is sure it is 

 of ectodermal origin. It later divides and forms muscle fibers. Simi- 

 lar conditions appear to be present in Cyclas (Zeigler, 1885). In the 

 fresh-water Prosobranch Paludina teloblastic pole cells are not foimd. 

 Scattered mesenchyme cells occur, and Tonniges (1896) states that these 

 have been produced from cells wliich He in front of the blastopore. 

 If this be the case, the formation of mesoderm in Paludina is similar 

 to that of the secondary" mesoderm of other ]\Iollusks. 



In Dino-philus (the cleavage of which is, from work now being done 

 in this laboratory by Dr. J. A. Nelson, typically annehdan in character) 

 Schimkewitsh (1895) appears to have recognized ecto-mesoblast, for 

 he says: " Gleichzeitig (with the prohferation of L'rmesodermzellen) 

 aber findet auch eine Immigration der Ectodermzellen in der Vorder- 

 theil des Embryos statt, und es wird durch diese Zellen eineMesem- 

 chymanlage gebildet". 



In the Annehd Aricia, Wilson (1897) discovered mesoderm arising 

 from the two posterior quadrants which could not be derived from the 

 pole cells, and which he located as coming from "either the second or 

 third quartet" {i.e., from c^ and d^ or from c^ and c^). These conclu- 

 sions were strengthened by a preliminary account of Tread well (1897) 

 on the cell hneage of Podarke, in which he derives secondary- mesoblast 

 from the third quartet (3a, 3c and 3d), and these results are confirmed 

 in a later and more elaborate paper (1901). The account of the meso- 

 derm formation given by Eisig (1898) for Capitella differs "uidely from 

 the results of most workers on annelidan and molluscan embryology. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



Here the definitive mesoblast is said to arise from 3c and 3d, which 

 would be in correspondenro with^Wilson's ''ecto-mesoblast/' wliile what 

 Eisig considers "larval" ur "secondary" mesoblast comes from that 

 portion of 4d which Wilson and Treadwell found in Nereis and Podarke 

 to form part of the wall of the enteron. These results have, it seems 

 justly, been called in question, though the careful investigation from 

 which they spring certain!}' gives credence to their accuracy. Tread- 

 well (1901) has called attention to certain figures (PI. XXXIX, fig. 42, 

 to PI. XL, fig. 49) of Hatschek on Eiiipomatus , which show "scattered 

 muscle cells in the upper hemisphere of the larva, which could hardly 

 have come from the feebly developed mesoderm bands at the posterior 

 end of the body", and suggests that they are of secondary origin; and 

 he likewise calls attention to the figures of Drasche (1884) for Pomato- 

 ceros which show similar conditions, though neither of these investiga- 

 tors appears to have reahzed their significance. In a prehminary paper 

 on the development of the mesoblast in Thalassema, Torrey (1902) 

 derives ecto-mesoblast from all three quartets. "In all there are 

 at least twenty primary cells of this character, but of them only ten, 

 arising from the first and third quartets, develop into functional mesen- 

 chyme, while at least ten degenerate and are finally absorbed by the 

 entoblasts." The greater part of the functional ecto-mesoblast comes 

 from three cells of the third quartet (3a, 3c and 3d) which correspond 

 closely to those which produce secondary mesoblast in Podarke. AU 

 of the cells arising from the second quartet and which sink into the 

 segmentation cavity are rudimentary and in the end entirely degen- 

 erate, thus recalling Wilson's similar conclusions regarding the "rudi- 

 mentarj'" cells of the definitive mesoblast of Aricia and S'pio. At 

 least six derivatives of the seven ecto-mesoblast cells which Torrey 

 derives from the first quartet have a similar fate. 



The mesoderm of Platodes, Annelids and Mollusks has of late years 

 been subject to much study, and various theories have been propounded 

 regarding the significance of the manner of formation of the middle 

 germ layer of these groups. Without entering into a prolonged dis- 

 cussion with regard to this question, a few of the more general points 

 may be mentioned. The results above tabulated and my own observa- 

 tions lead to the conclusion — which is, of course, not here stated as new 

 — that the primitive mesoderm of these groups is represented by that 

 which arises from the ectoderm, and which is alone found in the Poly- 

 clad (Wilson). The suggestion of Wilson that upon this hypothesis 

 ecto-mesoblast might well be found arising from all three quartets of 

 ectomeres has just been verified by the work of Torrey, and shows that 




362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



in this respect Thalessema presents an ancestral condition similar to 

 that of the Polyclad, though this does not necessarily imply close 

 genetic relationship. Moreover a descending series may be formed 

 both among Annelids and Mollusks of forms in which the presence of 

 ecto-mesoblast gradually merges into conditions in which it has totally 

 disappeared, showing that in these groups ectodermal formation of 

 mesoderm is on the decline. The increasing number of cases reported 

 in which ecto-mesoblast is larval in fate tend also to support this con- 

 clusion, nor do the results of Meyer, showing that much of this building 

 material is used for adult structures, offer a serious objection, since it 

 is a well-known fact that nature is not prodigal of the living substance 

 on which it works, and the secondary application of ancestrally obsolete 

 material is a fact of almost luiiversal occurrence. Nor can I see that 

 the later origin of ecto-mesoblast necessarily indicates its late phylo- 

 genetic appearance, as some have argued, since the early origin of 

 ento-mesoblast, if associated with the future elongation of the animal, 

 might well be .supposed to be directly explained by the precocious 

 segregation of this layer in those forms in which its development is 

 so intimately connected with future growth and development. The 

 early appearance and teloblastic growth of ento-mesoblast in the pos- 

 terior region of Annelids and Mollusks has directly led to decrease of 

 the radially appearing mesoblast. The Polyclad, which shows no 

 endo-mesoblast, has failed to develop such a formation, though a 

 tendency in that direction may be appearing, being marked by the 

 bilateral division of one of the endodermal derivatives (Wilson). 

 The fact that ecto-mesoblast as well as ento-mesoblast has been shown 

 among Annelids to arise from the same quadrant (Aricia, Podarke, 

 Thalassema) argues, it seems to me, conclusively for an entirely 

 separate mode of origin of the two. 



Closure of the Blastopore. 



With the segregation of the secondary mesoblast changes appear in 

 the form of the gastrula. Heretofore its shape has been broadly oval, 

 the antero-posterior axis being the shortest, but at this period two 

 regions of growth become manifest leading to marked change of form. 

 The multiplication and growth of cells of the second quartet in the pos- 

 terior region increase in activity, ever pushing forward the apical pole 

 area, while at the same time the region just anterior to the apical pole 

 is seen to be rising from the surrounding surface, forming a pointed 

 projection, the summit of which Hes at the anterior end of the forward 

 arm of the cross (PL XXX, figs. 78, 79). 




1904.] XATUR.^L SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 363 



Synchronously with these changes the blastopore continues to de- 

 crease in size, being narrowed by overgrowth of cells in that neighbor- 

 hood. It will be seen by the examination of fig. 78 that the large 

 cells of the third quartet in the anterior quadrants (3a"\ "^, ^^\ ^^^ and 

 3b"^ "^, ^'S ^^^) are all encroaching farther upon the smaller cells of 

 the same series, which have been crowded beneath them at the edge 

 of the blastopore. Posteriorly, derivatives of the third quartet have 

 completely surrounded the blastopore by the division and migration 

 backward of the small cells 3c- and 3d^ while more laterally the re- 

 maining small cells of this quartet and their neighboring larger cells 

 are crowding around the depression. The second quartet cells, 2a-^ 

 and 2c", or their derivatives, yet lie in the lateral corners; but as 

 closure of the blastopore proceeds they are crowded from this position 

 by encroachment of the third quartet both from before and behind, 

 which finally (fig. 79) join each other on the sides. In the anterior 

 median plane, however, a cleft yet remains between the large third 

 quartet cells, and after the inner of these large cells have divided, as 

 shown in fig. 79, cells of the second quartet, represented by the deriva- 

 tives of 2b-^, still occupy the space between them and there bound the 

 blastopore. Throughout this process the greatest extension of the third 

 quartet is manifest in the area covered by the posterior third quartet 

 groups, and this is doubtless connected with the disappearance from 

 the ectoderm in the anterior groups of the secondary mesoblast. The 

 blastopore closes from behind forward, to which process the larger 

 number of third quartet cells in the ectoderm of the posterior region 

 conduces. 



The posterior surface of the gastrula is now covered by large cells 

 of the third quartet, and in the median region by second quartet 

 elements. On the right posterior surface (left when seen from ventral 

 surface, fig. 79) may be seen one very large cell, Ex. (3c""), which will 

 later become the principal excretory cell of the larva. The region 

 anterior to the blastopore has been formed from the second quartet 

 cells of B quadrant which have been pushed backward by posterior 

 and apical growth, space being left for them through the shifting of 

 the large cells of the third quartet already described. The second 

 quartet cells of B quadrant have shown comparatively little division 

 or growth, and thus appear to occupy a relatively smaller space than 

 previously. 



The blastopore of Crepuhda (Conklin) is surrounded by second and 

 third quartet cells, all quadrants contributing. The same is true for 

 Ischnochiton (Heath). In Trochus (Robert) third quartet cells are 




364 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



mainly concerned in the closure of the blastopore, though the deriva- 

 tives of 2a^^-2d^^ also bound the narrowing opening. Planorbis 

 (Holmes) shows a very similar condition, \\dth the exception that 2d^^ 

 is crowded out. In Fiona all second quartet cells but a few aty^the 

 anterior edge of the blastopore are excluded before the opening closes. 



Organogeny. 

 The Velum. 



In its earher stages the velum of Fiona is so ill-defined on the upper 

 surface of the developing larva that its study has proved most diffi- 

 cult, and though more time has been spent upon this region than any 

 other portion of the developing organism the results have not been 

 as satisfactory as could be washed. Li^dng material would have been 

 of great value, and the lack of it has been a source of much regret. 

 After the breaking up of the cross the whole external surface of the 

 gastrula, and particularly the anterior end, is characterized by cells of 

 small and nearly equal size, among which there appear scarcely any 

 cells whose size would give them prominence, or cell rows or distinctly 

 marked groups. 



In the last stage described under the discussion of the develop- 

 ment of the first quartet the area covered bj^ this series of micromeres 

 represents nearly the whole upper surface of the flattened gastrula (fig. 

 75). The four arms of the cross are split transversely, while in the 

 angles between them lie the four groups of turret cells, each group 

 consisting of four cells of equal size. In axial relation the anterior and 

 posterior arms correspond to the direction of the median plane, while 

 the lateral are respectively right and left. The whole first quartet 

 area is completely surrounded and separated from the third by deriva- 

 tives of the second. By an increased growth of D quadrant of this 

 series the apical pole and its siu-rounding area is moved foi-w^ard in 

 the direction of the blastopore, while at the same time growth of first 

 and second quartet elements in the neighborhood of the tip of the ante- 

 rior arm of the cross causes that region to become raised, until some- 

 what later the pointed anterior end so characteristic of many Opistho- 

 branch larvae is produced (figs. 78, 79, 96). The visible cause of the 

 evagination of the ectoderm at this point may be fomid in the direc- 

 tions taken by spindles of the dividing cells which produce it, as in 

 most cases they are radially or diagonally directed toward the point 

 of greatest elevation. At this time the archenteron is roughly trian- 

 gular in outline, the anterior point of the triangle being marked by 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELrHIA. 365 



the large cell 4b^, which remains for a long time in this position and is 

 closely pressed up into this anterior cone. It may thus be possible that 

 the pointed anterior end of the larva is caused by the shape of the 

 enteron, upon which the outer layer is moulded. 



At first the terminal point of elevation corresponds in position to 

 the tip of the anterior arm, and is thus formed by derivatives of 2b" 

 and neighboring cells. At a somewhat later period the continued 

 growth of the shell gland area pushes the whole apical region forward, 

 so that eventually (figs. 95, 98, 100) this point is carried farther down- 

 ward on the anterior surface. At the same time continued growth 

 has increased the extent of the whole apical region, so that the anterior 

 end becomes more rounded than pointed, and finally (figs. 101, 102), 

 when the veliger stage is just being approached, a broad rounded con- 

 tour characterizes the anterior as well as the posterior end of the larva. 

 It is while these changes are taking place that the first evidence of a 

 distinct velar area appears. Early in this period of forward movement 

 the anterior trochoblasts may be seen to the right and left of the ante- 

 rior end of the forward arm, being distinguished from the derivatives 

 of the second quartet by their smaller size and compact arrangement. 

 They .thus, wdth the tip cell and two other cells behind them (probably 

 Ib^^S Ib^^^^ derived by transverse spHtting of the middle ceU), form 

 an irregular row across the anterior edge of the first quartet area 

 (fig. 76). Laterally the posterior ends of this semicircle are joined by 

 cells in the region of the tips of the lateral arms and thus meet the 

 posterior trochoblast groups. These latter have growTi larger than 

 their corresponding cells in the anterior quadrants, and so are almost 

 indistinguishable from second quartet elements which lie beneath 

 them. On this account it soon becomes impossible to separate them 

 from these cells, and so at a later period, when the velum in this region 

 becomes marked, I am unable to state how much of it is derived from 

 the trochoblasts, though the little evidence at hand indicates that they 

 form the largest portion of it. With change of axis the anterior end of 

 the velum is carried forward (PI. XXXVII, figs. 95, 98), and the forward 

 end comes upon a level wdth the an tero- ventral surface. A lateral view 

 (fig. 98) shows an irregular row of nuclei (cell outlines are usually in- 

 distinct) running downward and backward from the anterior median 

 point, and becoming lost as it continues posteriorly. This row, which 

 has ari-sen from the anterior trochoblasts, derivatives of the middle 

 and tip cells of the anterior arm and probably tip cell derivatives of 

 the lateral arms, will be designated V^ Below this band of cells 

 another irregular row may be distinguished composed entirely of second 




366 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



quartet cells which have lain nearest the first quartet area, and this 

 row, the first appearance of which is indicated in figs. 97 and 98, vdW 

 be designated V^, since it corresponds in general to the same cells in 

 Crepidula which are designated by that term. Unfortunately the 

 cells in this region have for some time presented no distinguishing 

 marks, wathout which exact derivation is precluded by their niunber, 

 but from their positions these lower cells probably correspond to deriva- 

 tives of 2b^'\ ^", ^" in the anterior group, and similar cells in the 

 lateral. At a later period (fig. 101) these rows tend to unite to form 

 an irregular line several cells in breadth, distinguishable only by their 

 nuclei. As the stomodseal invagination progresses the velar rows 

 are dra^vTi forward and downward in that direction, and l)}^ the growth 

 of the head vesicle they are also pushed downward laterally. It is 

 probable that elements of the second quartet which lie still lower than 

 those already mentioned become involved in the preoral velar area, 

 either functioning directly as ciliated velar cells or taking part in the 

 development of the imderlying region of the expanding velar ridge. 

 At the period represented in fig. 103, two irregular rows of nuclei 

 may be observed in the anterior cephalic region above the stomodaeum, 

 and these correspond in origin to the rows V^ and V^ above mentioned . 

 The postoral velar area is but faintly demarkated in the preparations 

 studied and crosses the ventral region just behind the stomodseimi. 

 The cells comprising it are doubtless, in the median region, derived 

 from the third quartet, to which are added second quartet elements 

 more laterally where the postoral velum joins the preoral. 



A portion of the velum does not in Fiona curve sharply toward the 

 apical pole, as in the case of Crepidula, where an anterior branch is 

 formed, but the whole extends backward around the head vesicle, so 

 that this part corresponds in position to the posterior branch of Crepi- 

 dula. This difference will be evident if a comparison is made between 

 figs. 78 and 82 of Crepidula and fig. 108 of Fiona. In the latter in- 

 stance it will be seen that the apical pole lies far forward from the pos- 

 terior ends of the velar edge, while in Crepidula the anterior branch 

 curves inward toward the apex, while the posterior branch continues 

 backward around the whole head vesicle, as does the entire velum of 

 Fiona. 



In Crepidida Conklin {Supplementary Note, p. 204) finds that the 

 median anterior portion of the first velar row (V^) probably arises 

 from the divided tip cells of the anterior arm, while laterally this row 

 is continued by the trochoblasts and cells at the ends of the lateral 

 arms. The second row in its mid-ventral region is probably "derived 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 367 



from the cell identified provisionally as 2b-^ which lies just beyond 

 the median cells of the first row", and he adds, "I have not been able 

 to determine whether any part of the second velar row arises by sub- 

 division of cells of the first; if not this row may include a few" of the 

 third quartet (3a"* and 3b"\ fig. 56) at the points opposite the anterior 

 turrets". It also seems probable {Supplementary Note, page 204) that 

 the cells 2b*22ii^ 2bi22i2 jjg outside the first velar row. Fig. 79 shows 

 two large cells between the first and second velar rows, and they appear 

 to represent the major portion of these cells. Smaller derivatives 

 from them may join 2b-^ in forming the median part of the second velar 

 row (V-). Conklin thus finds that the preoral velum arises from " a few 

 cells of the first quartet, many of the second and possibly a few of the 

 third". I do not believe that the third ciuartet becomes involved 

 in the preoral portion of the velum of Fiona, though doubtless cells 

 from this series are closely connected with it in the stomodseal region 

 and help in the formation of the postoral velum. It will be remembered 

 that in Crepidula secondary mesoblast is derived from the second 

 quartet, while in Fiona it is furnished by the anterior groups of the 

 third, and in this process the large cells of this series, which have hith- 

 erto lain well up on the sides of the gastrula, migrate over the under- 

 lying mesoblastic elements and thus become far removed from the 

 region where the velum first appears. The formation of secondary 

 mesoderm in the most anterior second quartet group of Crepidula 

 has doubtless the same effect of lessening the external area of the 

 quartet in that region, while the neighboring third quartet cells would 

 lie relatively higher in this form than in Fiona. So when the second 

 velar row forms in Crepidula it will lie relatively lower in the second 

 quartet group (2b-^) and more probably involve third quartet cells, 

 as Conklin states it probably does. 



Regarding the lineage of the velum of Planorhis, Holmes says that 

 "the tip cell (of the anterior arm) divides as far as I can deter- 

 mine, but once, and the two daughter cells become pushed apart by 

 the cell Ib'^", which forms the median cell of the upper row. These 

 cells extend to the anterior trochoblasts on either side, but in later 

 stages they may sometimes be separated from them by cells which 

 wedge in from below". The anterior trochoblasts follow these cells 

 posteriorly, but Holmes states that the tip cells of the lateral arms "do 

 not form a part of the prototroch but enter into the formation of the 

 head vesicle". In this Planorhis differs from Fiona. Blochmann 

 states that the right and left tip cells enter the velum of Neritina. 

 The lower cells in the prototroch Holmes derives from the second 




368 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



quartet, though he adds that at a later period cells are joined to the 

 prototroch from below, the lineage of which is obscure. 



In Ischnochiton, the larva of which is, in its velar aspects, remarkably 

 like the trochophore of Annelids, Heath finds that the prototroch is 

 composed of trochoblasts, of "accessor}^ trochoblasts " (derived from 

 the original basal cells of the molluscan or intermediate girdle cells 

 of the annelidan cross) of the tip cells in the anterior and lateral arms, 

 while in the posterior arm the tip cells go into the ventral plate, the 

 gap in the trochal ring being there bridged by derivatives of the median 

 cell of that arm of the cross. Thus in this annelid-Uke form of larva 

 none but derivatives of 2a", 2b" and 2c" from the second quartet 

 form the trochal ring. 



The prototroch of Trochus (Robert) is composed of twenty-five 

 cells, sixteen of which comprise the trochoblasts, six represent the 

 divided tip cells of A, B and C quadrants, while the other three are the 

 cells 2a, b, c^-"^ A very exact and close comparison may here be 

 made with the prototroch of the Annelids Amphitrite, Arenicola and 

 Clymenella, particularly with the former, for, as Robert says, "Vingt- 

 deux ont indetiquement la meme origine et la meme disposition que 

 celles de Amphitrite; le trois autres (2a, b and c^^"^ sont des derives 

 des cellules correspond antes de la meme Annelide.^' 



Among Annehds Wilson has found that the prototroch of Nereis 

 arises entirely from twelve of the sixteen primary trochoblasts, there 

 being no contribution from the second quartet. All sixteen of the 

 primary trochoblasts enter the prototroch of Amphitrite and Clymenella 

 (Mead), as is also the case with Arenicola (Child) and Podarke (Tread- 

 well), Regarding the close resemblance between the trochophore of 

 Ischnochiton and those of the Annehds, Heath says: ''The origin, 

 development and fate of these cells (primary trochoblasts) is pre- 

 cisely similar to the primary trochoblasts in Ischnochiton. The second 

 quartet in Amphitrite, Clymenella and Arenicola furnishes three cells 

 in each quadrant except the posterior, which enter the prototroch. 

 Two of the three are homologues of the divided tip in Ischnochiton, 

 while the third corresponds to a post-trochal cell". 



If now we compare the derivation and ultimate structure of the 

 annelidan prototroch with the typical molluscan velum some inter- 

 esting causal relations appear. At the time of its functional activity 

 the prototroch of Annelids is apparently a radially symmetrical struc- 

 ture. Among the ^lollusks we find, as a rule, a velum strongly devel- 

 oped anteriorly, with a considerable area of weakly ciUated ectoderm 

 between the ends of its posterior arms. There are numerous excep- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 369 



tions to this typical molluscan velum, Ischnochiton and Trochvs for 

 examples, in which the trochal ring is as complete as among the Anne- 

 lids. Returning now to the developmental history of the two groups 

 certain variations are found which, when viewed in the light of func- 

 tional larval structure, appear as a natural result of the divergent 

 forms of the larvae, these variations ha^nng been precociously thrown 

 backward upon the cleaving cells of the ovum. In Amphitrite, Areni- 

 cola and Clymenella among the Annelids, and Ischnochiton and Trochus 

 representing the more primitive Mollusks, all the primarj^ trochoblasts 

 (la^", ^^, -^S ^^^, etc.) in all quadrants go into the prototroch, while in 

 Nereis the same occurs with the exception of four, which may for all 

 four quadrants be designated la-^; these are not functional in this 

 manner, but are pushed inward and form part of the cephalic vesicle. 

 In Crepidula only the anterior trochoblasts help form the preoral velum 

 (la^^, la-', Ib^-, lb-'), and the same is true of Planorbis and possibly 

 also of Fiona. Accessory trochoblasts (la'-', la'---, etc.) form a part 

 of the prototroch of Ischnochiton in all quadrants, while in Podarke the 

 cells la'-", Ib'"^, Ic'---, corresponding to three of the above series, aid 

 in the formation of the prototroch {" secondary trochoblasts" of Tread- 

 weU), In Planorbis Holmes finds that the cell Ib'^" is the "anterior 

 median" cell of the prototroch, but does not find similar conditions in 

 any other quadrants. None of these elements which are, of course, 

 derivatives of the annelidan outer intermediate or molluscan middle 

 cells (with the exception of Ib'^" of Planorbis, which comes from the 

 inner basal) are found in the antero-lateral portion of the prototroch 

 of Amphitrite, Arenicola, Clymenella and Nereis. In all the above 

 forms except Nereis elements from the second quartet are also added 

 to the prototroch, and these may be designated with Treadwell "ter- 

 tiary trochoblasts". In Amphitrite, Arenicola and Chjmenella the 

 prototroch is increased in A, B and C quadrants by the cells 2a"'. 

 2a"-, 2a'^', etc. In Podarke 2a"- and 2a'-' in A quadrant, and similar 

 cells in B and C, function in like manner, while Ischnochiton shows the 

 same, for 2a'", 2a"-, etc., enter the prototroch from the anterior and 

 lateral quadrants ("secondary trochoblasts" of Heath). Of Hy- 

 droides Treadwell says: "Cells are added from the lower hemisphere". 

 For the prototroch of Trochus Robert derives the three cells from the 

 second quartet in A, B and C quadrants (2a'", 2a"^, 2a'^"', etc.). Com- 

 ing to those ]\Iollusks which possess a typical veliger, more cells are 

 found to be contributed by the second quartet, particularly in the 

 anterior quadrants. In Crcpidtda the tip cells of the anterior and 

 lateral arms go into the first vflai- row, while below numerous cells are 

 21 . 




370 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



added, so that the second row contains '' probably a few cells of the first, 

 many of the second and possibly a few of the third quartet". The 

 velum of Planorhis is rudimentary in structure but shows the same gen- 

 eral type of development as Crepidula, and here in like manner second 

 quartet cells are added. The tip cells of the lateral arms, according 

 to Holmes, do not enter the prototroch, but cells of the same series 

 below them function in this manner. In the anterior region both tip 

 cells and those lying beneath them from the second quartet enter into 

 the prototroch. 



From this short comparison of the lineage of the trochal area in 

 Annehds and Mollusks, it will be seen that as in the functional larval 

 form the typical molluscan velum shows greater anterior development 

 than the prototroch of Annelids, so also cells taken from the segmented 

 egg to complete the velum in this region exceed in number those des- 

 tined to form a similar area of the annelidan trochophore. To do this 

 the second quartet has become greatly encroached upon in furnishing 

 necessary building material for this structure in those Mollusks whose 

 larvae show strong anterior velar development, and in Crepidula the 

 third quartet also possibly becomes involved. It is natural to conclude, 

 as indeed the facts show, that those Mollusks which in the structure of 

 their larval prototrochs show great similarity to the homologous struc- 

 ture of the AnneUd trochophore, will exhibit a similar Hneage of the 

 cells constituting the larval organs compared — examples, Ischnochiton 

 and Trochus. 



Later Velar Development. — With continued invagination of the 

 stomodeeum and constriction of the foot, the velar area, which has 

 thus far been marked only by an irregular double row of cells 

 extending around the anterior half of the head vesicle and losing 

 itself in the posterior portion of that larval organ, becomes more 

 prominent and takes on the bilobed outline so characteristic of 

 the anterior end of veUger larvae. At first the velar lobes are 

 merely roimded swellings gradually rising from the upper sides 

 of the head vesicle and curving around, do^^-nward and inward 

 toward the stomodseum (fig. 105). The cells in this region do not 

 as yet exhibit that differentiation which later marks the promi- 

 nent ciliated margin from the underlying region. But as the lobes 

 begin to constrict beneath and become more prominent (fig. 106), those 

 cells which he on their most peripheral surface show marked increase 

 in size, and the ciHation wliich hitherto has been uniform and weakly 

 developed becomes more prominent in these cells. They may now 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 371 



be observed lyins; in a row on the rounded edge of the expanding 

 ridge, and though at first this series of cells is indistinctly marked, 

 it continues to increase in definiteness and in the size of its component 

 elements. Figs. 106, 107 and 108 (PI. XXXV) show successive 

 stages in the elaboration of these large heavily cihated cells of the 

 velar edge, and sections, as figs. 91 and 92 (PI. XXXII) in particular, 

 show the great increase in size which now marks them. 



Coincidently occurs the expansion of the velar lobes to form the 

 broad -u-ings or velar folds which characterize the functional larva 

 at the time it becomes free-s\vimming. As the velar area expands it 

 becomes deeply notched below where the lobes of the opposite side 

 rise to meet over the mouth, and this growth in length and breadth is 

 marked on the dorsal side as well. Figs. 109 and 110. side and dorsal 

 views of the same veliger, show the condition of development of the 

 velum just before the larva breaks from the egg capsule, though in these 

 drawings from fixed material the velum is of necessity considerably 

 contracted. In fig. 110 it will also be noted that the region just above 

 the mouth has grown out into a projecting process, and it is upon this 

 area that the former apical point (animal pole) lies. 



Head Vesicle. 



The Head Vesicle of Fiona reaches its greatest prominence at a stage 

 shown in fig. 104 and slightly older larvae. Somewhat later (figs. 105, 

 106) it becomes actually larger, but relatively smaller when compared 

 with the larva as a whole, and has also become greatly involved in the 

 formation of the velar lobes. It is composed of cells of the first quartet 

 lying within the trochoblasts and ends of the arms of the cross, and 

 its greatest extent is covered by cells which lie posterior to the lateral 

 arms. A posterior cell plate, such as is found in Crepidula, is not here 

 developed, for though doubtless the same cells are present, they have 

 multiplied to a much greater extent than in Crepidula or Planorbis, 

 and form a layer of small cells which are scarcely distinguishable from 

 those in front or at their sides. Neither is an apical cell plate demar- 

 kated in the region corresponding to the location of that structure in 

 Crepidula, the cells in front of the apex being all of similar size and 

 seemingly without regularity of arrangement, so that it is with the 

 greatest difficulty that the apex can be located among the large number 

 of small cells of equal size by which it is surrounded. As has been 

 described before, the point of greatest forward extension Hes first in the 

 region of the tip of the anterior arm of the cross, but with continued 

 growth the apical area becomes pashed forward so that it shortly occu- 




372 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



pies the point of greatest anterior extension, while the tip region of 

 the anterior arm through which the velum runs hes ventral to the apex 

 in the direction of the blastopore (figs. 95, 98). At the same time the 

 head end becomes rounded by increased growth of the cephahc area. 

 The four original apical cells, as shown in figs. 75 and 76, divide soon 

 after and again at a stage represented by fig. 95, so that this region, 

 which in Crepidula is in the fully developed vehger still marked by fom- 

 apicals (la"", etc.), here comes to consist of at least twelve very small 

 cells, among which no regularity of arrangement is sufficiently marked 

 to be of value in orientation. These cells are extremely difl&cult 

 to distinguish from numerous other cells of like form and structure 

 which cover the anterior surface of the head vesicle. The apical group 

 continues its forward migration in relation to the larva as a whole and, 

 as it appears, pushes aside some of the cells which have arisen from 

 divisions of the inner and outer basals of the anterior arm, for at a 

 later period (fig. 108) the apical group lies close against the first velar 

 row. Either such a shifting occurs or the basals become involved in 

 the development of the velum. In fig. 108 a row of cells may be 

 distinctly observed in which the nuclei are particularly large, extending 

 laterally from the apical point. My first thought on seeing them was 

 that they were a part of the velum, but after definitely locating the 

 position of the apex and following the later history of the velum, it is 

 clearly seen that this row never enters into the latter structure, but 

 represents in its cell-hneage derivatives of cells of the lateral arms of 

 the cross. No ciliation has been discovered in the apical area, and such 

 structures are certainly not strongly marked, though -wdthout examin- 

 ing living material a denial of the possible presence of such structures 

 would scarcel}^ be conclusive. 



Nerve and Sense Organs. 



Cerebral Ganglia. — The cerebral ganglia arise at a stage about 

 corresponding to fig. 105, though they do not become well marked 

 imtil somewhat later (fig. 108). During this period cells may be 

 seen prohferating inward from the ectoderm of the head vesicle 

 in the two regions which lie lateral from the apical area. A row 

 of cells with large nuclei are at this time plainly visible running 

 laterally from the apex, and it is along the anterior side of these 

 cells that the ganglia first arise. This row has been identified as 

 coming from the lateral arms of the cross, and cells lying between it 

 and the anterior portion of the first velar row are from the same source. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 373 



Later many of these large cells also divide and go into the ganglia. 

 Thus it will be seen that the two cerebral gangha arise from elements of 

 the two lateral arms, the anterior rosettes, and probably also from some 

 cells of the anterior arm which have been pushed laterally by the 

 advance of the apex and He in the region where the gangUa develop. 

 The tip cells of the lateral arms certainly do not take part in the forma- 

 tion of the ganglia, as they he too far laterally and probably go into 

 the velum. Wliere no large cells, the definite hneage of which is known, 

 are left as landmarks, it is obviously impossible to give absolute deri- 

 vatives for the gangUonic rudiments. Comparmg, however, the above 

 approximate derivation with other Mollusks which have been studied 

 in this connection similarities are evident. In Crepidula the ganglia 

 "very probably arise from the lateral extensions of the anterior arms". 

 Holmes has been able to state very definitely the manner of origin of 

 these gangha in Planorbis, as here they are surrounded by conspicuous 

 cells. He says: "The tip cells of the lateral arms and the cells lying 

 immediately above them do not enter into the formation of these 

 masses; with the exception of these, two cells in each arm, all the cells 

 in the lateral arms of the cross, the cells of the anterior arm, except the 

 tip and basal cell, and the central region of the cross, except the four 

 apicals, and the two cells lying in front of them, enter into the forma- 

 tion of these rudiments". 



Otocysts and Pedal Ganglia. — The otocysts appear at a consider- 

 ably earher period than the gangha which iimervate them or the 

 cerebral ganglia. They are first seen as shght invaginations on 

 the sides of the foot shghtly below the stomodseal invagination, 

 and at a stage shoT\Ti in figs. 103 and 104 have developed to 

 deep pits, the openings of which have become much constricted. As 

 these constrictions narrow, the two otic vesicles arise and are con- 

 nected with the external ectoderm by strands of cells which re- 

 sulted from the constriction of the outer portion of the invaginations. 

 Somewhat later the pedal gangha are seen shghtly external to the 

 otocysts in position. These gangha arise in part from the strands 

 which connected the otocysts with the ectoderm, and in part from other 

 cells proliferated from the ectoderm in the same region. At first the 

 cerebral ganglia are not connected with each other by a commissure 

 nor with the pedal ganglia, but later cells grow out and meeting con- 

 nect the cerebral ganglia together, while between cerebral and pedal 

 gangha hke connectives arise, probably both gangha contributing 

 ceUs to their formation. These connectives are very large (fig. 94), 




374 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



and the whole cephalic nervous system is much concentrated. Behind 

 the pedal gangha and somewhat higher dorsally may be distinguished, 

 particularly in older larvae, the rudiments of the pleural gangha, which 

 also appear to have arisen by delamination of the ectoderm and lie in 

 close association with cerebral and pedal ganglia. A very hea\y 

 commissural strand connects the two pedal ganglia, and the whole 

 nervous system of the larva foreshadows in its compact structure the 

 adult condition, individual ganglia being difficult to distinguish. Figs. 

 92 and 94 show sections through this region at a somewhat later 

 period than figs. 88 and 89. Eyes have not developed to a fvmctional 

 condition in the oldest larvae observed. Sections of these show pig- 

 ment granules, within cells lying close to the cerebral ganglia, and in 

 some cases these cells lie around a slight invagination of the ectoderm — 

 the first evidence of optic organs. 



Excretory Organs. 



The large excretory cell which lies on the right side of the larva and 

 forms the chief member of a group of similar greatly vacuolated cells 

 lying in that region arises from the third quartet in the C quadrant, 

 and from its large size and conspicuous appearance its complete history 

 is kno-RTi. Returning to a segmentation stage, in which the egg con- 

 tains about one hundred and twenty cells (fig. 70), it will be seen that 

 the third quartet group in C quadrant contains seven cells. Divisions 

 next occur in the three large cells, 3c^-^^, 3c"^- and 3c^^" (fig. 77). The 

 cell 3c"" does not divide with these, nor does it ever again divide, but 

 continues its growth, soon becoming the largest element in the ecto- 

 derm. As gastrulation proceeds this large cell, 3c"^^ (Ex.), the origin 

 of which is thus established, appears at the right of the elongating 

 gastrula (left of figs. 78,, 79) and with the closure of the blastopore lies 

 midway between dorsal and ventral surfaces, as shown in figs. 98 and 

 99. It has become much larger, when compared with its neighboring 

 cells, both from lack of division and by actual growth. As the vehger 

 takes form this cell becomes] yet more marked (fig. 102), and when 

 the shell gland has become prominent (fig. 104) it is seen lying in a sHght 

 depression surrounded by small cells which are in an active state of 

 division. As the foot arises and the cephalic end of the veliger is 

 differentiated from the body, the large excretory- cells move upward 

 along the body just posterior to the pedal groove, on the right side, 

 this change of position being a natural sequence of the general torsion 

 of that region (figs. 105, 106). The intestine has also become well 

 developed by this time as a sohd strand of cells connecting the pos- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 375 



terior end of the enteric cavitj' with the ectoderm, and this latter point 

 of contact is just below the large excretory cell. Fig. 88 shows a sec- 

 tion through this region, showing the excretory cell to be much vacuo- 

 lated and to lie for the most part below the ectoderm. At a consider- 

 ably later stage (figs. 109, 110) its position and structure are shown 

 just before the veliger escapes from the egg capsule. A large nucleus, 

 which usually contains several small nucleoli and having the general 

 appearance of nuclei in cells which have for a long time remained 

 undivided, lies at the lower end of the cell. The cytoplasm is greatly 

 vacuolated and at its peripheral end, where it meets the exterior, is 

 seen a deep pit with constricted mouth. This appears to function 

 as an intra-cellular duct, for it comes into connection at its inner end 

 with the large vacuoles which fill the cell. Just above and anterior 

 to the large cell is a group of smaller ones which contain darkly stained 

 nuclei and pigment granules. One of these, the largest, also contains 

 vacuoles and lies nearest the cell 3c"". In somewhat older larvae one 

 or two of these smaller cells, which lie close to 3c"", have increased 

 much in size, become greatly vacuolated and appear to fvmction as 

 their larger neighboring cell. These smaller accessory excretory cells 

 are also doubtless of ectodermal origin and, since they lie between the 

 principal one and the blastopore, are doubtless derived from the same 

 quartet. 



In addition to the excretory cells above described others of a similar 

 nature are found in the larva of Fiona. Sections (figs. 90, 91) of fairly 

 well-developed veligers show two cells (Nph) nearly symmetrically 

 placed on the two sides of the body just behind the constriction sepa- 

 rating head from body region. These cells contain large nuclei and 

 their protoplasm is clear and greatly vacuolated. In a slightly older 

 stage (the oldest larvae examined) yellowish-brow^I granules are very 

 evident, lying in the meshwork of the vacuolated cytoplasm. The 

 cell on the left side (fig. 91) lies just to the side of and slightly higher 

 than the otocyst of that side, being closely associated with its ganglia, 

 while the one on the right side (fig. 90) lies higher and is in close prox- 

 imity to the smallest cells of the large excretory organ of that side. It 

 may be distinguished from the cells of this organ by its clear cytoplasm 

 and the color of the granules lying in it. In later stages another cell 

 of similar nature may be seen beside the one on the right side, but 

 only one has been observed on the left. The origin of these cells is not 

 known. In earlier stages cells of slightly smaller size lie in the regions 

 which they later occupy, but cannot be distinguished in structure 

 from neighboring mesodermal elements. However they lie close to 




376 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



the ectoderm and may have come from that source. The later fate 

 of these cells is miknouTi, but as they are increasing in size they prob- 

 ably function as important larval organs. They v^-ill here be designated 

 "nephrocysts/' for they correspond to cells of similar position and 

 structure described by Trinchese (1881) for the larva of Ercolania 

 and other Xudibranchs, by whom an excretory fimction was ascribed 

 them. Older and living material is desirable before making definite 

 statements regarding the nature and function of these apparently 

 similar larval" organs of Fiotia. 



Numerous investigators have seen and described with various inter- 

 pretations the excretory organs of larval Opisthobranchs. As early as 

 1839 Loven observed the anal kidney in Nudibranch larvae, but did 

 not recognize its fmiction, though indicating that it was probably an 

 imdeveloped sexual organ. Likewise Sars (1840) described a similar 

 structure in the veliger of Tritonia, which, together with the large endo- 

 dermal cell which lies near it, he associated in common fimction with 

 the liver lying on the opposite side of the enteron. In ^olis hke 

 structures were fomid. Later (1845) he distinguished the vacuolated 

 excretory cell and its neighboring pigmented cells, classing the whole 

 as a reproductive anlage. Reid (1846) observed a hke structure in a 

 number of Xudibranchs {Doris. Polycera, Doto, etc.), considering it 

 to be probably the heart from contractions which he saw it midergo. 

 In Vogt's very thorough paper on Actceon, appearing in 1846, the excre- 

 tory organ is somewhat neglected, though his figures indicate its pres- 

 ence. Nordman in the same year described this organ in Tergipes, 

 and referred a reproductive significance to it. Schneider (1858) also 

 found it in Phyllirhde, but assigned no definite fimction. Langerhans 

 (1873), ha\'ing observed in the li\-ing larvae of Doris and Acera cells in 

 the anal region which contained concretions, and from which drops 

 were extruded considered the organ to be of an excretory nature. 

 In 1875 Lankester foimd similar conditions in Aplysia, and con- 

 sidered the organ to have arisen either from intestinal cells near 

 which it lay or from the ectoderm. 



Trinchese (1881) described an ''anal gland for Ercolania which is 

 strongly pigmented and lies on the right side of the body". This he 

 beheved arises from three or four mesodermal cells which acquire 

 pigment and by their di\dsion form the organ in question. The same 

 was found in Amphorina, Bergia and Doto, in the last case being paired. 

 In addition to the anal excretory organ, Trinchese also found in the 

 above forms two "rini primive" in the dorsal region under the ecto- 

 derm, one right and the other left. These he described as vesicular. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



spherical or ovoid bodies having a lower part full of transparent 

 liquid, in which lay concretions of a yellowish color. These he denomi- 

 nated "nephrocisti" (nephrocysts) and ascribed to them a mesodermal 

 origin, since they have no connection ^Wth the exterior. Haddon 

 (1882) found a mass of cells on the right side of Jantheria and Philine, 

 near the anus in Elysia on the left side, and in Pleurobranchidium on 

 both sides. In 1888 Rho found similar organs in Chromodoris which 

 he stated arise from a few mesoderm cells containing numerous con- 

 cretions and excreta which indicate their functional value. He con- 

 cluded that this structure corresponds to the right Prosobranch 

 kidney, considering the left to be rudimentary. Lacaze-Duthiers 

 and Pruvot (1887), in a paper on Opisthobranch embryology, described 

 the anal organ of Aplysia, Philine, Bulla, Pleurobranchus, Doris and 

 members of the family .EoHdidse, stating that in origin it is entirely 

 ectodermal and that it was none other than an "anal eye." This eye, 

 it was claimed, becomes strongly developed in the bhnd larvae and 

 later atrophies as true ej'es appear. It stands in connection with a 

 cell-mass, ganglionic in nature, the "asymmetrical centrum" of 

 Lacaze-Dutliiers. 



MazzarelH (1892) came to some very different conclusions from work 

 on Aplysia. He beheves the organ in question to have neither the 

 structure nor function of an eye, and, moreover, it remains present 

 in the larvae after eyes are developed. From its position and structure 

 it is doubtless a kidney. He derives it from paired rudiments which 

 originally were closely associated with the endodermal elements of 

 the aboral pole (mesentodermal cells) and which later, separating, 

 wander into the blastocoel cavity and, after torsion begins, first the 

 left and then the right come to lie in the neighborhood of the anus and 

 together form a small ca\'ity which acquires communication with the 

 exterior. This unpaired kidney is homologous to the kidney ("niere'.') 

 which in many Prosobranchs is found in the same place and, as is 

 well knowTi, forms the anlage of the definitive kidney. Mazzarelli, 

 therefore, concludes that the anal kidney of the Opisthobranch larva 

 is a secondary kidney ("secondare niere"), while the primitive kidney 

 of these Mollusks is already known (the "nephrocisti" of Trinchese). 

 The anal kidney is but the anlage of the definitive kidney, which in 

 this case corresponds not to the right but to the left adult kidney of 

 the Prosobranch. 



Heymons (1893) has carefully described the conditions found in 

 Umbrella. The excretory rudiment is here at fu'st paired and arises 

 from the cells 3c", 3d", which sink somewhat below the surface and 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



divide several times, one cell in each group remaining large. Thus 

 the excretory cells of Umbrella are ectodermal in origin. In further 

 history He^nnons finds that the large cell of the left side decreases in 

 prominence and finally is indistinguishable from those surrounding 

 it, while the right continues to enlarge and, with the torsion of the larva, 

 is carried higher on that side. Later a second large cell appears by 

 the side of this one, which Heymons thinks cannot represent the 

 original left cell, as this would presuppose too great a migration, but 

 rather one of those associated with the original right, the growth of 

 which has been delayed. The function of a larval excretory organ is 

 assigned only to this group of cells by Heymons. 



In 1895 Mazzarelh, after a study of the development of a large num- 

 ber of forms {Philine, Gastropteron, Actoeon, Oscanius, Pleurohranchus, 

 Tethys, Archidoris, Aplysia, Hermcea, Janus, Polycera and Haminea), 

 came to the conclusion that the anal oi-gan of Loven, Sars, Pruvot, 

 Lacaze-Duthiers and others was not, as Lacaze-Duthiers, Pruvot and 

 HeATnons maintained, of ectodermal origin, but rather mesodermal, 

 arising from two large and other smaller mesoderm cells which become 

 pigmented and which by a slight ectodermal invagination acquire 

 an external opening. In later development he finds these cells form a 

 connection with the pericardimn, which has arisen from a mesodermal 

 mass closely connected with them. Therefore, he concludes that 

 the anal kidney of the Opisthobranch larva is not homologous -with 

 the head kidney of the Prosobranchs, but from its origin, position and 

 relation (particularly in connection with the pericardiimi) it is none 

 other than the anlage of the definitive kidney of the adult And 

 also, since it hes to the left of the rectum, it corresponds to the 

 kidney of the Gastropods which possess but one, and to the left kidney 

 of those -^-ith two. Viguier (1898) describes the anal kidney of Tethys, 

 distinguishing an excretory lumen, around which are grouped several 

 cells; he does not indicate its origin. 



Among the Prosobranchs externally situated larval excretory organs 

 appear to have been found generally. Salensky (1872) has described 

 such bodies filled with concretions lying upon the side of the body in 

 Calyptrcea and Nassa. Bobretzky (1877) found the same in Fusus, 

 these cells lying behind the velum and without an imderlying ectoder- 

 mal layer. This latter condition is placed in doubt by McMui-rich 

 (1886). Similar organs to the above were foimd in Fissurella by 

 Boutan (1885), while in Capulus (v. Erlanger, 1893) a single large 

 ectodermal cell, probably excretory in fimction, was found on each 

 side of the body behind the velum. For Crepidula Conklin (1897) has 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 379 



minutely described a group of ectodermal cells lying laterally just 

 behind the velum and probably arising from the second cjuartet; they 

 become much vacuolated, filled with darkly stained granules and be- 

 fore metamorphosis separate from the ectoderm and are lost. Erlanger 

 (1892) concluded that the larval kidney of Bythinia was partly ecto- 

 dermal and partly mesodermal, and had no connection with the 

 definitive kidney of the adult. The earlier results of Biitschli (1877) on 

 Paludina as well as Bythinia were enlarged by Erlanger (1891-2), 

 showing that in these fresh-water Prosobranchs the larval kidney 

 was formed from inner mesodermal and outer ectodermal por- 

 tions. 



Rabl (1879) established a mesodermal origin for the primitive kidney 

 of Planorbis, and Holmes (1900) in his late work confirms the same. 

 Fol (1879) derived the larval kidney of Planorbis entirely from the 

 ectoderm. Wolfson (1880) described the larval kidney of Limncea 

 as arising from a large velar cell on either side which migrates inward, 

 retaining connection with the exterior through an intra-cellular duct. 

 Meissenheimer (1898) says of Limax, we have "in der urniere ein rein 

 ekto-dermales Gebilde vor uns, zu dem das Mesoderm auch nicht den 

 geringsten Beitrag geliefert hat." From his figures and discussion it 

 appears very evident that in this form the primitive kidney is purely 

 ectodermal in origin. In 1899 ^Meissenheimer published his investiga- 

 tions on the "Urniere der Pulmonaten" (of the Basommatophora, 

 Ancylus, Physa, Planorbis, Limncea, and of the Stylommatophora, 

 Succinea, Helix, Arion, Limax). In both these groups he shows the 

 larval kidney to be entireh^ ectodermal in origin and similar in struc- 

 ture, the lu-inarv^ tube of the latter group being many-celled, while in 

 the former but four cells comprise it. In both a ciliated cell or cells 

 closes the inner end of the tube, and for this reason ]\Ieissenheimer com- 

 pares the primitive kidney of the Pulmonate with the end cells of the 

 water vascular system of the Platyhelminthes. 



Among the Lamellibranchs Hatschek (1880) describes the larval 

 kidney of Teredo as probabh^ both ecto- and mesodermal in origin. 

 In the single left primitive kidney of Cyclas, Stauffacher (1897) found 

 a similar though more complicated structure arising from both ecto- 

 dermal and mesodermal elements. 



Meissenheimer (1901) finds that in Dreissensia polyinorpha the larval 

 kidneys arise from ectodermal cells wholly, each of the two being formed 

 from a few in-wandering cells. The structure is more simple than that 

 of the Pulmonates and ^Meissenheimer suggests that it may be the 

 ground type of the group. This might then be described as an ecto- 




3S0 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



dermal invaginating tube w-ith the end closed b}- a vacuolated heavily 

 ciUated cell. 



From the above account of some of the more important observations 

 and conclusions upon the nature and origin of the larval excretory- 

 organs of the Lamelhbranchs and Gastropods (and of the latter more 

 particularly of the Opisthobranchs), one is strongly impressed with the 

 feeling that much more work must be done upon these organs of mul- 

 luscan larvee before we are ready to come to definite conclusions 

 regarding their mutual relations and homologies, if such exist. Nor 

 has the investigation recorded in this paper brought for\\-ard facts 

 which justify an immediate solution of the problem. The anal kidney 

 of Fiona doubtless corresponds to the similar structure described for 

 so many members of the Opisthobranchia, but its derivation is totally 

 different from the results obtained by some of the more recent and 

 careful workers in this group. 



Mazzarelli's conclusions regarding its mesodermal origin, resulting 

 from investigations upon a large number of closely related forms, are 

 very different from mine. There is no point regarding the cytogeny 

 of Fiona of which I am more certain than that the group of cells con- 

 stituting the anal kidney is of ectodermal origin, and one member 

 of the group (the largest, 3c"^^) has been traced through every step 

 of its history, from the initial cleavages which produce it to its fimctional 

 condition upon the right side of the veliger larva at the time of hatching. 

 In this respect m}^ results are entirely in accord with those of Heymons 

 for Umbrella and, except for the function assigned to the resulting 

 organ, agree closely with Lacaze-Duthiers and Pruvot's derivation 

 of the same structure from ectodermal cells. With regard to the 

 fate of this organ, the work of Rho and Mazzarelli appears to show con- 

 clusively that it becomes metamorphosed into the kidney of the adult, 

 and the latter's comparison of this organ with the adult kidney of 

 those Gastropods which possess but one, or with the left of those with 

 two, is in entire accord with the generally accepted opinion upon this 

 subject. Unfortimately material has not been available for a study 

 of the metamorphosis of Fiona. But on a priori grounds it should 

 be similar in all essential features to the above-mentioned processes of 

 development in closely allied forms. The metamorphosis of the anal 

 kidney of the larval Opisthobranch into the definitive kidney of the 

 adult might seem, at first sight, fair grounds on which to doubt its 

 ectodermal origin, since the latter structure has generally been con- 

 sidered to be a mesodermal derivative. But if in this connection be 

 considered the recent results of Meissenheimer, who derives the adult 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 381 



kidney and allied structures of Limax and Dreissensia, representing 

 two distinct molluscan groups, from ectodermal rudiments, after an 

 investigation which bears every evidence of care and accurac}-, the 

 possibility at least of a similar manner of formation among the 

 Opisthobranchs must be granted. 



So little is as yet known of the "Xephrocysts" of Trinchese that any 

 discussion of their significance and possible homologies must of neces- 

 sity be largely hypothetical. An exact knowledge of their derivation 

 and structure would be of the utmost value. In Fiona when first seen 

 the}^ lie in the cleavage cavity, but whether they have wandered there 

 from the ectoderm or are from the first mesodermal in character is 

 yet an unsolved problem. Should they prove to be of ectodermal 

 origin their position might justify a close homology with the Proso- 

 branch larval kidney, and possibly also with those of the Pulmonates 

 and Lamelhbranchs, since Meissenheimer has indicated the larval 

 kidneys of the two latter groups to be of ectodermal origin, and his 

 work is supported by the earlier investigations of Wolf son and Fol. 

 Should these nephrocysts prove entirely mesodermal there is yet a 

 possibility of their similarity to the larval kidneys of the Prosobranchs, 

 Lamelhbranchs and Pulmonates, through the investigations of Biitschli 

 and Erlanger for the Prosobranchs, Rabl and Holmes for the Pulmo- 

 nates and Hatschek for the Lamellibranchs, w^ho derived the primitive 

 kidney of members of these groups in part or entirely from mesodermal 

 elements. However, the structure of the nephrocysts of Opistho- 

 branchs is very different from the primitive renal organs of the groups 

 above cited, for, as far as is known, they appear wholly enclosed in 

 the schizocoel with no external ducts. The fact of their very rudi- 

 mentary structure suggests an explanation for the great development 

 reached by the anal kidney. When we consider that in other groups 

 possessing true larval excretory organs the anlage of the definitive 

 kidney does not develop into a condition of functional activity until 

 after metamorphosis, while among Opisthobranch larvse, eveni before 

 the time of hatching, certain cells of this structure are actively con- 

 cerned in the work of excretion, the causal relation between rudimen- 

 tary structures on the one hand and advanced development on the 

 other is brought forcibly to mind. The nephrocyst of the Opistho- 

 branch is not a prominent or well-developed structure, and with its 

 phylogcnetic decline precocious development has arisen in the rudi- 

 ment of the definitive kidney, resulting in functional activity in a 

 part at least of its formative elements long before development of 

 the adult organ. 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



There is yet another possible explanation of the renal organs as 

 found in Opisthobranch larvse which will be stated but briefly, since a 

 preponderance of hypothesis over fact is always to be regretted. It 

 is generally conceded that whether the anal kidney be of mesodermal 

 or ectodermal origin its rudiment is at first a paired structure, one 

 part of which may fail to develop into a renal organ (Heymons) or 

 unite with the other (Mazzarelli). The nephrocysts are paired struc- 

 tures, one lying close to the anal kidney, the other in an almost similar 

 position on the opposite side of the body. It is possible that the nephro- 

 cyst of the right side is but a part of the anal kidney of that side, while 

 that of the left represents the degenerate whole of the rudiment of that 

 side. In this case, of course, true larval kidneys would be wanting. 



The Enteron. 



As the archenteron arises from the cleaving entoblast it presents, 

 when viewed from the vegetative pole, an irregular depression, the 

 bottom of which lies considerably below the edge of the blastopore. 

 The macromeres, 5A, 5B, 5C and 4D, are at the bottom of this pit, with 

 oa, 5b and 5c lying peripherally from them, while above these and next 

 to the ectoblast come 4c^, 4b^, 4a^ and the smaller cells 4c\ 4b^ and 4a^. 

 In the posterior region are found the small cells E\, E-, e\. e^ (entero- 

 blasts) which have arisen from 4d. The fifth quartet and all the 

 macromeres are the next cells to divide, this resulting in enlargement 

 of the wall area of the enteron, and by this division into smaller ele- 

 ments closer contact between the blastomeres results. Hitherto the 

 entoblasts have been much rounded (except those meeting directly 

 in the center), and have lain together in a ver\' irregular manner, 

 particularly after invagination began. With diminution in size and 

 rearrangement of these cells a distinct ca\dty ^\'ith closed dorsal wall 

 arises (fig. 80). At the anterior end lies the large cell 4b^, while pos- 

 teriorly and laterally are found the two large cells 4a2, 4c^; between 

 and behind them are the enteroblasts. At first the enteron is longer 

 on the right side (left of figures), the cell 4c^ lying more posterior than 

 4a^, this being the natural result of the division which early separated 

 the large mesentomere from 4D of that side and the lack of growth 

 and division in this latter cell for so long a period. But as development 

 proceeds and the whole enteron grows in antero-posterior extent it will 

 be noted that 4a^, which is a very large cell and easily distinguishable, 

 gains in its backward course upon the opposite cell of like lineage (4c^), 

 comes to lie opposite to it and later more posterior (figs. 80, 81, 82). 

 This process is the beginning of the torsion of the intestine, and is appa- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 383 



rently to be explained in at least its first manifestations as the direct 

 result of increase in growth of one side over the other. After 4a^ hes 

 considerably more posterior than the derivatives of the large cell, 

 which before lay opposite it (4c^S 4c^^ fig. 81), the cell 4b- is seen to 

 be imdivided as yet and still at the anterior median point of the 

 enteron, showing that the change of position of 4c- relative to its 

 opposite cell has been the result of greater increase in the area of the 

 left over that of the right enteric wall. 



During tliis process 4a^ has not been observed to divide and it main- 

 tains its large size throughout. On the opposite side 4c^ has divided 

 into cells of equal size and divisions are continued in this region, result- 

 ing in the thinning of that portion of the enteric wall and an equahza- 

 tion of the size of the cells which compose it. With the continued 

 growth of the enteron 4a^ is moved still more posteriorly and finally 

 toward the right (left of figs. 82, 83). In fig. 84, which represents 

 the enteron in optical section at a stage about corresponding to fig. 104, 

 4a' is seen lying directly in the median fine. Above, in the anterior 

 median portion of the enteron, is a group of large yolk-ladened cells 

 which have been derived from 4b^ and its neighboring cells. This 

 group will soon shift somewhat to the left and become the rudiment of 

 the liver. 



As was seen before, the small cells E\ E^, e\ e-, which were separated 

 from the anterior end of the mesentoderm, at first lie between 4a- and 

 4c'. An actual section at this stage parallel to the ventral surface 

 (fig. 85) shows that the inner of these cells are yet in contact with the 

 enteric cavity. I am confident that the cells in this figure marked 

 " enteroblasts " represent mesentoblastic derivatives. Their history, 

 position, size and the structure of their nuclei, which are small and 

 darkly stained, correspond to these cells. With the increase in extent 

 of the left side of the enteron and, after the closure of the blastopore, 

 by its continued growth, these enteroblasts, which may be distinguished 

 from their neighbors by their darkly staining nuclei and their smaller 

 size, become pushed from the median plane toward the right side as the 

 large cell 4a^ advances around to a more and more posterior position 

 (fig. 83). Finally, when 4a^ itself lies on the median line, these cells Ue 

 entirely to the right and are more posterior than those which have come 

 from 4c and 5c. A sUghtly diagonal actual section, as fig. 86, shows the 

 large cell 4a- in the median plane. Just behind it and slightly to the 

 right are shoA\Ti in the section five small cells lying closely pressed 

 between 4a^ and the shell-gland invagination behind. These cells 

 correspond in position and in appearance to the small enteroblasts

of fig. 85. If we now examine section fig. 87, which is taken through 

 a vehger sUghtly older than that showTi in fig, 104, the relation of the 

 enteron to its surroimding structiu-es may be observed. The large 

 entodermic cell, Aa.^, has been successively traced through preceding 

 stages from its origin on the left side of the archenteron to its final 

 position on the right of the enteric cavity, as is shown in the figure. 

 Just posterior to this will be noted a mass of cells connecting the enteron 

 with the ectoderm. The nuclei of these cells are compact and deeply 

 staining, and the cytoplasm is decidedly clearer and contains less 

 yolk than that of the cells directly surrounding the enteric cavity. 

 Moreover, their position beside the large cell 4a- and now, through the 

 torsion which the enteron has midergone, their later position some- 

 what posterior to this cell, indicates the probability of their correspond- 

 ence with the "enteroblasts" of fig. 86 (PL XXXI) and earlier stages. 

 in which the identity of these cells is imquestioned. 



It is proper in this place to consider again the results of Carazzi's 

 work on Aplysia and its relation to the mesentodermal history of 

 Fiona. It -wnll be remembered that Carazzi's account of the lineage 

 of 4d up to a stage when its derivatives number twelve cells exactly 

 parallels my results on Fiona, but regarding the fate of these cells 

 there is lack of agreement. The anterior small cells of Aplysia are 

 believed to be purely mesoblastic, while at least four of them in Fiona 

 appear, from the preceding account, to be entodermal in nature. 

 Carazzi, however, derives endoderm from the two small posteriorly 

 directed cells (e, e^ of Aplysia) which correspond to z\, z^ of Fiona. 

 These latter cells were last seen lying at the posterior end of the gas- 

 trula of Fiona closely pressed against the ectoderm.. At a later period, 

 when a large number of mesodermal elements lie in this region, the z^, 

 z" cells become indistinguishable from these. Sections of later stages 

 (fig. 87) show two cells which are larger and clearer than the entero- 

 bla.sts and which he against the ectoderm where the intestinal mass 

 touches it. The}- may represent the- cells z^ z^, but of this there is 

 no evidence except that given above. Anal cells are not a marked 

 feature of the developing embryo of Fiona, but at this time sections 

 in particular show two cells of somewhat larger size than the surroimd- 

 ing ectodermal elements, against which the forming intestine abuts 

 and which are doubtless comparable to the anal cells of other forms 

 (fig. 87, An.C). 



It will now be seen that the portion of the enteron lying most 

 posterior and close against the shell-gland invagination has been 

 derived from the cells wliich formed the bottom and the left side of 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 385 



the original archenteric invagination (5B, 5b, 4C, 5C, 5c, 4D, 5A) 

 while dorsally and anteriorly are seen more yolk-ladened elements 

 whose origin may be traced to the large entoderm cell 4b^ and those 

 aromid it. The stomodaeal invagination breaks through at a much later 

 period between the descendants of 5a and 4b and their neighboring 

 cells, which have been turned in an anterior direction, while doubtless 

 cells from 4c and 5b also push in upon this region with the closure of 

 the blastopore. By the torsion which the enteron has undergone the 

 upper mass of large yolk-ladened cells is moved more and more to the 

 left, while in like manner 4a- turns to the right. While this is occurring 

 the invaginating shell-gland has pushed the anterior and posterior 

 walls of the enteron very closely together, both enteric and cleavage 

 cavities being practically obliterated (fig. 86). Wlien this structm-e 

 evaginates the enteron again opens out and has then lost its elongated 

 form, being rounded with its wall cells in close contact (fig. 87). 



In Umbrella as well as in Fiona 4b" occupies the anterior end of the 

 enteric mass pushing up into the pointed apex of the gastrula, and the 

 same is true of Aplysia in which there are but two large blastomeres, 

 though according to Blochmann's nomenclature such does not appear 

 to be the case. In later stages the positions of the large cells of the 

 fourth quartet of Umbrella and Fiona are identical. The intestine of 

 Umbrella is said to be formed by C" and D" (5c and 5d), which, as Hey- 

 mons did not take into consideration an entoblastic contribution from 

 4d, correspond fairly weU to the conditions found in Fiona, where these 

 cells he just at the place of origin of the intestine and may well take 

 part in its future development. The cell-lineage of the archenteron 

 of Crepidula is given as follows: "The four macromeres form the roof 

 of the archenteric cavity. The cells of the fifth quartet form its lateral 

 boundaries, arching the cavity on all sides save the posterior. Here 

 the archenteric cavity runs backward between the cells 5C and 5D (5c 

 and 5d) nearly to the posterior boundary of the egg. The cells of the 

 fourth quartet come together on the ventral side of the archenteron, 

 forming its floor anteriorly and ultimately giving rise to some of the 

 many small cells which form that part of the mesenteron, adjoining 

 the stomodjEum." The intestine arises from the posterior lower right 

 region of the enteron as a tube-like evagination, formed from the entero- 

 blasts derived from 4d and neighboring small endodermal cells and 

 ending blindly against the ectoderm. Later it elongates and the end 

 is carried somewhat upward along the right side by trosion of the larva. 

 It contains a lumen from the first. As the stomach begins to enlarge 

 it is seen to be bounded by large cells dorsally and anteriorly in its lower 

 25 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



regions. As development proceeds it is elongated, its posterior end 

 being ventrally directed and turned toward the right. The develop- 

 ment of the hver of Crepidula comes later, being' retarded by the 

 great amount of yolk. 



The next change in the development of the enteron of Fiona may 

 be observed in fig. 105, which represents a veliger in which the ali- 

 mentar}'- canal is beginning to become differentiated into several parts. 

 Anteriorly is seen the stomodaeum, which has as yet not broken through 

 but touches the wall of the enteron. Above and to the left of this 

 point of contact is a decided lobing of the wall of the enteric cavity, 

 formed of the large yolk-ladened cells which at an earlier period lay in 

 the anterior region of the archenteron. This is the rudiment of the 

 hver, and as development proceeds the invagination becomes larger and 

 more constricted at its base, forming a rounded lobe upon the left dorsal 

 waU of the enteric canal. Behind the rudiment of the liver the enteron 

 has widened into a capacious sac which is larger at its upper anterior 

 end, the walls of the whole being formed of rather small cells which are 

 yet rich in yolk. This is the stomach, and it ends blindly against the 

 intestinal mass behind and to the right. The intestine is yet a sohd 

 strand of cells connecting the posterior end of the stomach with the 

 ectoderm. With the growth of the veliger this strand has become 

 more slender, elongated and turned fon\-ard, its distal end lying well 

 up on the side of the body behind the constriction which forms the 

 foot. The huge excretory cell lies just dorsal to this point (figs. 106, 

 107). In figs. 90, 91, 92 and 93, which represent coronal sections of 

 a veliger somewhat older than figs. 105 and 106, and shghtly more 

 mature than that of fig. 107, it "will be seen that the intestine is still a 

 solid strand of cells, and that the oesophagus is as yet not in open con- 

 nection \\dth the rest of the alimentary canal. An examination of a 

 considerably older larva (figs. 109, 110) shows a very small lirnien, 

 just beginning to form in the center of the intestinal strand, but as 

 yet no communication between oesophagus and enteric cavity. 



Stomodceum and Moidh. 



As the blastopore narrows (fig. 79) it becomes entirely surrounded, 

 except at the anterior end, by third quartet cells. At the anterior 

 point second quartet cells from 2b^^ and 2b^^^ lie along the edge also. 

 Figures of a later stage (as 97, 98) show the blastopore as a mere 

 rounded opening, its edges and walls below thickly set with darkly 

 nucleated cells, and when complete closure occurs a plug of these cells 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 387 



may be observed upon lateral optical section dipping down from the 

 region of closure to the enteron beneath. These cells have come largely 

 from the third quartet of all four quadrants, and represent the smaller 

 cells of this quartet which lay nearest the open blastopore. This 

 condition exists but for a short time, for soon a broad pit may be ob- 

 served in this region occupj^ng exactly the place w^here the blastopore 

 closed. As it forms the cells which have been invaginated to form the 

 blastopore-plug open out again so that a blind pit results, the lower 

 surface of which is formed by those cells which were first pushed inward 

 as the blastopore was closing, and correspond to the second and third 

 quartet elements which are shown in fig. 79 surrounding the blastopore. 

 The stomodaeal invagination continues to increase in depth by growth 

 and division of the cells which already form it and by further invagina- 

 tion of surrounding cells, so that, as the form of the veliger begins to ap- 

 pear (figs. 103, 104, 105, 106), second and third quartet cells from all 

 the quadrants lying in the region probably become involved. , At first 

 the stomodaeum is broad and shallow, but as it increases in depth it 

 narrows and becomes more dorsally directed at its inner end. In 

 section, fig. 90, and in drawings of the oldest veHger shown (figs. 109, 

 110), the stomodaeal invagination has as yet not formed an open con- 

 nection with the enteron, but shortly afterward this occurs, at which 

 time the stomodaeum is much elongated. Union is established with the 

 stomach pouch just below the opening of the large liver lobe. 



Fiona agrees with a large number of Mollusks in which the blasto- 

 pore closes and the stomodaeum forms at the same point. Among 

 them may be named Nassa (Bobretzky), Neritina and Aplysia (Bloch- 

 mann), Elysia (Vogt), various ^Eolididae (Trinchese), Doris (Langer- 

 hans), Crepidula (Conklin), Planorbis (Holmes) and TrocJms (Robert). 

 In Patella (Patten), Fusus (Bobretzky), Pteropods and Heteropods 

 (Fol) and Limncea (Lankester) the blastopore is said to remain open 

 and pass over directly into the mouth. 



Shell-gland and Foot. 



If one examines the segmenting egg somewhat later than such a 

 stage as shown in fig. 73, it will be observed that the posterior has con- 

 siderably outstripped the anterior region in extent and that, together 

 with numerous divisions, the cells have also enlarged considerably in 

 size. The area which lies along the median line, and so is derived from 

 the second quartet, shows most plainly this rapid increase in extent, 

 and it is here particularly that the cells themselves become greatly 




388 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



enlarged and prominent. This is the region of posterior growth, and 

 from this area arise both the shell-gland and the foot. 



Taking up first the history of the former of these two organs, it will 

 be found that in a stage represented by figs. 95 and 98 the whole 

 area between the blastopore and the end of the posterior arm of the 

 cross shows karyokinetic activity, but particularly in the region marked 

 Sh.G. the cells have increased considerably in size. As growth con- 

 tinues these cells upon the upper and posterior surface of the gastrula 

 protrude above the level of the ectoderm, the area which they cover 

 having the appearance of a rough cobble-stone pavement; but some- 

 what later they settle down and form a smooth surface. The center of 

 this area, which now lies just opposite the region of the stomodaeum, 

 begins to invaginate, pushing the enteron before it and reducing its 

 cavity, so that there results a deep pit which, growing in size below, con- 

 stricts above, and around which are several rows of large granular cells 

 (fig. 102). Such a condition lasts but a short time, for soon the invagi- 

 nated area opens outward, the whole forming a large thick-walled 

 cap upon the posterior end of the veliger, constricted around its edge 

 and merging abruptly with the thin-walled ectoderm anterior to it (fig. 

 104). As growth proceeds the shell-gland spreads and becomes much 

 thinner, while the larval shell appears as a secretion of the large cells 

 which compose it. As the shell continues to extend over the veliger 

 its outer edge is marked by several rows of large cells, which by their 

 secretive activity lay down the substance which forms the shell (figs. 

 105, 106, 107). Almost from its origin as a distinct structure the shell- 

 gland is sHghtly displaced to the left side of the body, and as it increases 

 in extent this lack of bilateral symmetry becomes more marked (fig. 

 107). 



The ventral prominence which develops into the foot arises some- 

 what later than the shell-gland, and the cells which go into it come from 

 the second quartet of D quadrant and the third quartet of C and D 

 quadrants. The large ectodermal excretory cell, which in the larva 

 lies just behind the foot, serves as a guide to show that much of the 

 foot, like this cell, arises from C quadrant of the third quartet; and 

 though no such landmark is present on the other side, the early history 

 of the two quadrants are so similar that we may reasonably suppose a 

 like origin from the third quartet for the left side of the foot. Lillie 

 has derived the foot of Unio from cells of the second quartet, and Conk- 

 lin appears to have done the same for Crepidula. Holmes states for 

 Planorbis that as the cells immediately behind the Ijlastopore are of 

 third quartet origin, probably the "median portion of the anterior end 




1904.] ' NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 389 



of the foot is derived from some of these cells", Robert describes a 

 similar condition for Trochus. In Fiona not only the median portion 

 but also much of the lateral area certainly comes from the third quartet. 

 The foot here does not arise as a paired swelling as in Patella (Patten), 

 Fulgar (McMurrich) and Trochus (Robert), but shows from the first 

 a median protuberance which increases in size and later becomes 

 broadened and flattened (figs. 103, 108, 110). Its upper surface is 

 covered with numerous cells, but they are not arranged to form a 

 conspicuous cell-plate as in Crepidula. Large' cells mark its lower 

 surface and they soon begin to secrete the operculum. 



Larval Musculature. 



It is particularly unfortunate that for a study of the muscles of the 

 velum no living material has been available, as without this many 

 points of interest must of necessity be lost. When the veliger breaks 

 from its capsule it presents an appearance shown in figs. 109, 110, 

 though it should be remembered that in fixed material, from which 

 the drawings were made, the muscles must be much contracted. The 

 whole posterior region is swollen into a huge transparent vesicle, at the 

 anterior end of which lies the contorted alimentary canal. In dotted 

 outline is represented the probable position of the cuticular4ike shell 

 before shrinkage. In a larva of such age one of the most characteristic 

 featiues is a large dorsal retractor muscle, which has its posterior point 

 of attachment well to the left of the dorsal side of the posterior vesicle. 

 It runs forward and branches just before reaching the Hver lobe, its 

 two anterior ends becoming attached to the alimentary canal and the 

 body wall in the region of the oesophagus. In structure it is composed 

 of large spindle-shaped interlacing cells, which are flattened dorso-ven- 

 trally, giving the muscle a band-like form. In function this muscle 

 doubtless acts as a retractor for the anterior and particularly the upper 

 portion of the cephalic region. A dorsal view of the same vehger 

 shows two lateral muscles, the right and left retractors of the foot, 

 which arise about midway back on the sides of the posterior vesicle 

 and extend forward through the lower part of the neck region, to end 

 in branching fibers in the foot. That of the right side is larger than 

 the left, and in earher stages (figs. 105, 106) is much thicker than later 

 and relatively larger. In figs. 105 and 106 is shown a small muscle 

 (\'1.R.) extending from the dorsal neck region to the velar folds where 

 it branches greatly. Other similar retractor muscles of the velar 

 lobes extend from the walls of the alimentary canal and the body wall 




390 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [April, 



outward into the velar area branching extensively. Fine interlacing 

 fibers are also found in the foot in older stages. 



Returning to the period marked by fig. 105, the dorsal retractor 

 muscle is seen to be a short thick strand of cells extending from the 

 shell region to the enteron near the position of the liver. It is here 

 already branched and rims along the sides of the alimentary canal. 

 The right retractor of the foot is, as shown, a very heavy cell strand 

 which unites the foot with the lower dorso-lateral portion of the shell. 

 A view^ from the left side would show a muscle occupying a similar 

 position, but in this case much thinner (fig. 107 shows their relative 

 sizes at a slightly later stage). Even at this early period the dorsal 

 retractor is posteriorly attached to the left of the median line. 



Bearing in mind the distinction of Lillie and others between primary 

 mesoblast (ento-mesoblast) and secondary mesoblast (ecto-mesoblast 

 or larval mesoblast), the attempt has been made to distinguish between 

 these two sources of muscular tissue in the developing larva of Fiona, 

 with, however, but partial success. The velar retractors, which lie in 

 the region of the head vesicle, are formed from secondary mesoblast. 

 Those cells which we have seen cut off from the third quartet in the 

 tw^o anterior quadrants lie in the antero-lateral region of the gastrula, 

 and may for some time be distinguished from the primary mesoblast 

 cells. When at an early period spindle-shaped muscle fibers appear 

 in this region, their origin from these cells can scarcely be doubted. 

 The component elements of the dorsal retractor are hard to distinguish. 

 When this muscle first appears at a stage about midway between figs. 

 104 and 105, several large cells lie wedged in between the rounded 

 w^all of the enteron and the ectodermal area in the upper region of the 

 shell-gland. The evidence is strong that these cells at least are from 

 the primary mesoblasts. At this time, however, other cells extend 

 along the enteron, connecting the compact posterior group with the 

 loosely lying spindle-shaped elements of the velar retractors. They 

 doubtless help form the more anterior portion of the dorsal retractor 

 and, lying as they do so close to where secondary mesoblast was formed, 

 may be derivatives of it. The two retractors of the foot and the inter- 

 lacing fibers of that organ itself are doubtless composed of cells which 

 have come from 4d. From the above account it is seen that a true 

 ''larval mesoblast" is foimd in Fiona, since much at least of the mus- 

 culature of the velum, a purely larval organ, is derived from this 

 secondary mesoblast. 



No organ in any way comparable to a larval heart is to l^e found in 

 the oldest veligers which I have studied. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391 



Change of Axis and Form of the Developing Organism. 



The egg at the time of laying is spherical. With the division into 

 four cells the primary egg axis, running between the centers of the 

 animal and vegetative poles, becomes shorter than the diameter of the 

 equatorial plane. As segmentation proceeds this relation persists 

 (fig. 14), and with continued division the formation of a large cleavage 

 cavity becomes more pronounced. Until the cleaving egg reaches a 

 stage of over sixty cells its surface, when viewed from either pole, 

 appears almost perfectly rounded, but shortly after this its antero- 

 posterior axis becomes shorter than the lateral (figs. 45, 56, 74), this 

 relation holding until increased growth in the posterior and anterior 

 quadrants causes elongation in that direction. Until about a stage 

 shown in fig. 74 the primary egg axis, running from the center of the 

 animal to the center of the vegetative pole, follows a straight line. 

 Immediately after this, accentuated growth of the posterior region 

 initiates a bending of this axis, which finally results in its complete 

 folding upon itself, or a rotation through 180 degrees. A sharpl}- 

 pointed anterior projection arises (fig. 78), while at the same time the 

 posterior dorsal region is rapidly increasing in extent and changing 

 the embryonic axis. As the gastrula elongates the apical pole is moved 

 forward, and by the time the first velar row becomes distinct the origi- 

 nal polar axis has become so bent upon itself as to form an angle of 

 nearly 90 degrees (figs. 95, 98). With the continued multiphcation 

 of cells in the head region that portion of the larva changes from its 

 originally pointed shape into a rounded though not prominent head 

 vesicle, while at the same time the opposite end is rounded by continued 

 growth of second and third quartet elements (figs. 100, 101). The orig- 

 inal polar axis will be seen in these figures to have moved through about 

 135 degrees. In the next stage, represented by figs. 102 and 104, 

 the head vesicle has reached its largest relative size when taken in 

 connection with the veliger as a whole. Comparing these figures with 

 those which have gone before, a marked increase will be seen in the 

 antero-posterior depth, and if this be considered in connection with the 

 great change of axis the enormous growth of the posterior region will 

 be evident. It is generally conceded that the head vesicle of mol- 

 luscan and annelidan larvae is of functional importance in serving as a 

 float. In Fiona the head vesicle is never large and prominent and a 

 substitute may reasonably be expected. With the differentiation of 

 the velar lobes and foot the shell-gland may in figs. 105, 106 and 107 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



be seen to be rapidly spreading over the posterior region. As this 

 is being accomphshed it also grows greatly in size, producing the enor- 

 mous posterior vesicle which in figs. 109 and 110 extends far behind 

 the internal organs of the body. The importance of such an organ 

 must be considerable and, taken in connection with the early decrease 

 in size of the head vesicle, strongly suggests that its functional value 

 is similar in kind to that usually ascribed to the anterior or head 

 vesicle of other larvse. 



In all older veligers figured the original polar axis has become com- 

 pletely bent upon itself, a rotation of 180 degrees ha\dng occurred. 

 With regard to the median plane of the future embryo, the first cleavage 

 plane is obhquely transverse to this plane. When the mesoderm is 

 formed it is throTvn over toward this median plane, and from the first 

 is approximately bilateral in position (figs. 24, 31, 34). The elements 

 of both entoblast and ectoblast, which in late stages of cleavages lie 

 on the median plane, appear to be derived from cells of the early 

 cleavages which occupied similar positions. Little rotation, if any, 

 is apparent other than a certain amornit of irregularity found in all 

 portions of eggs with equal or nearly equal cleavage. 



Conklin describes for Crepidula an entire rotation of the ectoblastic 

 cap at the time when the anterior and lateral cells of the fourth quartet 

 arise. Heymons shows a similar rotation in Umbrella. Such a change 

 of axis in the germ layers does not occur in Fiona, nor is there necessity 

 for it. The large macromeres of Crepidula and Umbrella are here 

 represented by small cells, which do not modify the positions of the 

 germ layers at the time of their origin nor necessitate supplementary 

 rearrangement. 



Abstract, 



Maturation begins at the time of laying. Two polar bodies are 

 given off, the first of which may or may not divide. The un- 

 segmented egg of Fiona is rich in yolk, the spherules being com- 

 paratively small. In shape the egg is round, but shghtly flattened 

 in the direction of its polar axis. One to three eggs are found in a 

 roomy egg capsule. 



The early cleavage is strictly spiral after the dextral sequence. The 

 first quartet of micromeres are much smaller than the macromeres, 

 but with succeeding divisions the cleavage becomes equal in character. 

 After the four macromeres are formed they give rise to successive 

 quartets of micromeres. The first three quartets contain all the ccto- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



blast. The mesoblast arises in part from the fourth quartet cell 

 of D quadrant. The remaining fourth quartet cells and all the 

 macromcres are entoblastic, as is also the case with a small portion 

 of 4d. 



The first quartet of ectomeres give rise to the trochoblasts and ecto- 

 blastic cross. To the latter structure are added as "tips" the upper 

 cells of the second quartet in all quadrants. The cross is radially 

 spiral in symmetry, and does not increase in breadth by transverse 

 spHtting of its arms until a comparatively late period. Cells from the 

 first quartet form the head vesicle, cerebral ganglia and eyes, and a 

 portion of the first velar row. 



The second quartet has a similar cleavage history in all four quad- 

 rants until a stage of about 150 cells. In later development the 

 elements of this quartet in D (posterior) quadrant show great 

 increase in size and divisional activity, initiating the posterior point 

 of growth, with resulting bending of the embryonic axis. Cells from 

 tliis area form the shell-gland and median portion of the foot, A 

 large number of second quartet cells from the anterior and lateral 

 groups aid in the formation of the velum. The more ventral elements 

 of B quadrant help to close the blastopore. 



In the third quartet bilateral cleavages first appear in the posterior 

 quadrants (cells 3c^ and 3d^). Secondary mesoblasts arise from the 

 anterior quadrant groups of this quartet (cells 3a2"^ 3a"" and 3b^"S 

 3b^"^). The large anal excretory cell (3c"") and its associated cells 

 are derived from C quadrant of this quartet. Third quartet cells 

 surroimd the blastopore as it closes, with the exception of a small 

 anterior portion; much of the stomodseum and the lateral portions 

 of the foot come from third quartet elements. 



The mesoblast of Fiona is derived from two sources, ento-mesoblast 

 from 4d and ecto-mesoblast from the third quartet in A and B quad- 

 rants. The greater amount comes from 4d and forms teloblastic 

 bands in the posterior region of the gastrula. The secondary mesoblast 

 (ecto-mesoblast) is largely "larval" in fate, since much of it goes to 

 form the muscles of the velum. From the history of 4d it appears 

 that this ceU contains both mesoblastic and entoblastic derivatives, 

 the latter taking part in the formation of the intestine. . 



As is the case with many Opisthobranchs, the gastrula is sharply 

 pointed anteriorly, the apical point at first lying at the end of the 

 anterior arm of the cross. 



The blastopore at the time of closure is surrounded by third 

 quartet cells, except at its anterior edge, where second quartet cells are

present. The stomodaeum later forms at the point where the blasto- 

 pore closed. 



The shell-gland at first forms a deep invagination, wliich later opens 

 out and covers the posterior end of the veliger with a cap of large 

 cells which soon begin to secrete the shell. From the first the shell 

 is shghtly shifted toward the left, and this as}Tnmetr\^ becomes more 

 marked with continued groA\-th. With the enlargement of the shell 

 a conspicuous posterior vesicle results. 



The foot arises as an unpaired swelling below the stomodaeum. Its 

 under surface later secretes an operculum. 



The first velar row is formed from the anterior trochoblasts (A and 

 B quadrants), the tips of the anterior arm of the cross, and possibly 

 from other cells of the first quartet in this region. The second velar 

 row is derived from underlying cells of the second quartet. A post- 

 oral velar area is but .slightly marked. In later development the velum 

 becomes bilobed and broadly expanded. 



A prominent head vesicle is not present in the older veligers, and 

 •with this may be correlated the development of a large posterior vesicle. 

 No apical sense-organ has been found, nor are distinctly marked apical 

 plates present. The cerebral gangUa appear in the angles between 

 the anterior and lateral arms of the cross. Otocysts are formed by 

 invaginations of the ectoderm upon the sides of the foot, and pedal 

 ganglia appear closely associated with them. The e3'es are late in 

 appearing and are intimately connected with the rudiments of the 

 cerebral ganglia. 



The anal kidney of the larv-a is derived from the ectoderm, coming 

 from 3c"" and associated cells. With the torsion of the lar^-a this 

 group is shifted farther to the right, and eventually lies well up on the 

 right side of the veUger above the anal opening. Primitive ex- 

 cretory- cells are also found hing in the body ca\-ity laterally behind 

 the velum. 



The enteron is formed by invagination of the entomeres, which at 

 first form an elongated sac; with the evagination of the shell-gland 

 this becomes roimded. The liver is derived from large yolk-ladened 

 cells l}'ing at the anterior end of the enteron, and later the rudiment 

 of this organ becomes tmned toward the left side. Torsion of the 

 enteron results from lengthening of the left side and is caused by 

 increased growth of that region. The intestine is at first a sohd thick 

 cell-strand and is composed largely of entoblasts from 4d; it later 

 elongates and acquires a lumen.

THE FOSSIL LAND SHELLS OF BERMUDA.' 



BY ADDISON GULICK. 



Last summer (1903), through advantages offered by the new Bio- 

 logical Station in Bermuda, I was able to collect the shells on which 

 this paper is based. In the study of the material I owe much to Dr. 

 H. A. Pilsbry, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



It will be necessary in the discussion of the fossils to compare them 

 with the species that are now native, in the looser sense, to the islands. 

 In drawing the line between these and the snails supposed to have 

 been brought by commerce, I shall follow Dr. Pilsbry 's latest paper on 

 the ''Air-breathing Mollusks of the Bermudas. "^ I shall also rule 

 out all the httoral species, including Truncatella, because the fossil 

 beds were not situated where such shells could be expected. 



The most unsatisfactory feature of work on Bermudian fossil land 

 shells is the difficulty in determining the ages of the various deposits. 

 The rock of Bermuda is exclusively solidified dunes of calcareous sand, 

 and the soil is the rust-colored residue of the weathered rock. In 

 weathering, the surface of the rock becomes completely broken up 

 into pockets and crevices packed with the earth. It is estimated^ 

 that every inch of earth must represent eight or nine feet of rock eroded, 

 and thus when it is possible to judge of the average depth of soil formed 

 over a deposit, that depth can be made an index of the age of the 

 deposit. 



Probably the oldest good fossiliferous deposit that I examined is 

 collecting locality Xo. 807 (see ]\Iap No., 3) of the Bermuda Biological 

 Station, at a hard-stone quarry on the west side of Knapton Hill, 

 about midway between Hotel Frascati and "Devil's Hole." At this 

 point a layer of eight or ten inches of red earth containing shells was 

 covered by an ancient dune. The dune has become hard limestone, 

 and its top has been eroded until now the red earth in its pockets must 

 represent a layer averaging not less than six inches in thickness. The 

 series of Poecilozonites that we took from this bed is very incomplete, 

 and the fossils of all the genera are poorly preserved, but notwith- 

 standing this we are able to recognize at least eleven species and sub-

species. These are enough to identify its fauna with that of another 

 deposit, locaHty No. 806 (see Map No. 2), where the shells are abundant 

 and well preserved, but vnth. no external evidence by which to estimate 

 their age. This locaHty is another hard-stone quarry, where the 

 excavations have uncovered a number of crevices and a cavern of 

 considerable size. The shells are in stalagmitic conglomerate at the 

 mouth of the cavern, and in the crevices, and also in the earth that 

 fills certain of the pockets. They may represent a considerable period 

 of time, but there is no way to distinguish any difference in age. 



Another deposit at the same locality as the one last mentioned is a 

 horizontal band of slightly reddish rock about half-way up the face of 

 the quarry, and from two to three inches thick. This is part of the 

 rock out of which the cave and pockets were eroded, so that the shells 

 here are very much older than the others at No. 806; but here, again, 

 there is no basis for a comparison with the date of No. 807. The re- 

 mains here are obscure casts of Pcecilozonites circumfirmatvs and of 

 what appear to be Vertigo and Carychium. 



I collected from three other beds in this neighborhood what seem to 

 represent the same formation as the pockets of No. 806. 



The first of these, locality No. 814, is a newly opened quarry just 

 south from Coney Island. A red-earth pocket [here contained a fine 

 series of Pcecilozonites nelsoni, very large, but wanting the most ex- 

 treme examples of both the elevated and the depressed variations. 

 There are also fossihferous conglomerates in caverns at this quarry, 

 but they are composed of gravel too fine to contain Pcecilozonites 

 nelsoni. 



The best fossil specimens of Pcecilozonites reinianus came from local- 

 ity No. 815, near Harrington House. They are noticeably larger than 

 the recent specimens. No. 816, near 815, but on the shore of Castle 

 Harbor, has large numbers of Pcecilozonites hermudensis zonatus and 

 Pcecilozonites reinianus, the former associated with Pcecilozonites 

 nelsoni in a conglomerate. 



Bifidaria rupicola, found in the red earth of No. 806, may perhaps be 

 an importation subsequent to the formation of No. 807, and Strobilops 

 huhbardi, found at the same place, possibly may not have been a per- 

 manent resident; but we can safely assume that all the other species 

 from the above localities belong to the epoch of the red-earth streak 

 at No. 807. The remaining three deposits from which I collected are 

 clearly much more recent than No. 807. These are in sand pits, in 

 the nearly pure sand of partially sohdified dunes. None of them have 

 any clear signs of red earth, either about them or overlying them. 




408 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April. 



The shells at these places are so perfecth^ preserved that even the term 

 "semi-fossil" seems a misnomer for them. Probably the sand pre- 

 serves them by saturating the water with lime before it reaches them. 



One of these shell deposits, locality No. 818, on the land of Mr. Benja- 

 min Trott. in Tucker's Town, is only from 8 to 36 inches below the 

 surface. The P. nelsoni were mostly in the upper foot of the deposit, 

 where the bank is thoroughly sohdified by the rain ; but a few inches 

 lower the sand is still loose enough to be scraped out with a strong hoe. 



The two localities last to be mentioned, Nos. 808 and 809, are essen- 

 tially alike. They face the Devonshire marshes on the northwest 

 side — 808 near the north end and 809 close to the barracks. The sand 

 in these dunes appears to have drifted from near the present line of 

 the north shore — a consideration which may yet give a clue to their 

 age.

Dr. Pilsbry's conclusion, from the anatomy of Pcecilozonites, that the 

 oldest importations to Bermuda came from continental America, is thus 

 confirmed by a large majority of the fossil forms. Bermuda, at the time 

 of the No. 807 deposit, was characterized by not less than five genera 

 of continental affinities, of which at least one had been resident long 

 enough to have developed new generic characters and a respectable 

 diversity of species. The abundance of the individuals, too, and the 

 size and variability of some of the species, seem to show that the island 

 was not inhospitable to continental genera at that epoch. There were 

 not only the large extinct species Pcecilozonites nelsoni and Pcecilozo- 

 nites cupula, but larger varieties also of Pcecilozonites bermudensis and

Pcecilozonites reinianus than are now living. The largest specimens 

 even of Pcecilozonites circumfirmatus and Succinea hermudensis are 

 among the fossils. These snails must have found more food than there 

 is now on the uncultivated ground. There is also geologic evidence 

 that they belonged to a more prosperous epoch than the present. Prof. 

 Heilprin reports that in excavations for one of the docks, specimens 

 of Pcecilozonites nelsoni were brought up from a peat deposit at a depth 

 of forty feet below water. A rise of the land sufficient to put these 

 shells ten feet above sea-level (see Map No. 1) would multiply the land 

 area eight or ten times, changing it from a narrow ridge, hardly two 

 miles wdde at its widest, into an elliptical area, including, it is true, some 

 large lagoons, but in all about ten miles across and more than twenty 

 miles long. A large, protected interior valley would then receive the 

 fertile soil that is now washed into the lagoon by every storm. It 

 would not surprise me if the deposits at locality 807 should be shown 

 to date from the period of this Greater Bermuda, but a person need 

 hardly wait for this proof before supposing that the indigenous con- 

 temporaries of Pcecilozonites nelsoni were also characteristic of Greater 

 Bermuda. 



In spite of their evident prosperity, I do not think it could be proved 

 that these snails lived under any densely shading vegetation. The 

 humidity at Bermuda makes such a shade less necessary for snails 

 than it is in many places. I have often seen Succinea hermudensis 

 clinging to grass and to trunks of trees in such situations that I imagine 

 an American summer day would have desiccated them. The tract 

 about Prospect Hill (No. 809) must have been desolate, unshaded land 

 when the hills were growing dimes, yet the sand here (localities 808 

 and 809) contains numerous well-developed specimens and quite a 

 variety of species. These must either have lived where they are found, 

 or else have been blown there from some place almost equal h^ wind- 

 swept. 



The extinction of species that were able to prosper on those barren 

 parts of the island seems to me a strange occurrence. If, as I beheve 

 is probable, the sand for these dunes came from near the present north 

 shore, then the island must have had very nearly its present shape 

 and size when these snails were alive. Thus when the Greater Bermuda 

 sank, the change seems to have set new dunes in motion across this 

 section of the Lesser Bermuda; and Pcecilozonites zonatus, Cary- 

 chium hermudense and Euconulus turhinatus not merely survived the 

 subsidence, but even formed a considerable population on the parts of 

 the remaining island that were most damaged by the changing condi- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 413 



tions. How many other species still survived in the less altered sec- 

 tions it is impossible to say. It is hardly possible to prove that even 

 the set of fossils from No. 806 belong to any earlier date. Indeed we 

 might draw an analogy between Bifidaria rupicola at No. 806, which 

 may be one of the later arrivals, and Bifidaria servilis at No. 818 and 

 Pupoides marginatus at No. 809, either of which we can hardly hesitate 

 to treat as recent arrivals. But however this may be, the sand-pit 

 deposits are against the supposition that the Carychium and its hardier 

 associates were exterminated merely by the increasing barrenness of 

 the island. We should be in a better position to discuss the other 

 causes if we knew whether these species survived till after the West 

 Indian arrivals had begun to take possession of the land. The West 

 Indies snails, especially Polygyra microdonta , of Bahama, are at present 

 much the commonest of the "native" snails, and it may be that their 

 special fitness for the more barren land of the new Bermuda made them 

 deadly competitors to the old species. The newer formations at the 

 west end of the islands, which I had not the time to visit, may perhaps 

 be the ones in which to look for evidence on this question. 



Notes and Descriptions. 



Thysanophora vortex Pfr. 



Living animals quite abundant under stones; but I looked in vain 

 for fossil specimens. Greater Antilles, Bahamas, Southern Florida. 

 Thysanophora hypolepta ' Shuttl.' Pils. 



I found more examples of this than of Z. 77iinuscuh(S among the 

 fossils, but among the living snails Z. miniiscuhis seems to be far more 

 abundant. It is supposed to he indigenous. 

 Polygyra microdonta Desh. 



Excluding importations from Europe, this species is the one now most 

 in evidence. It is partial to the coarse native grass, but is to be found 

 almost everywhere. I was surprised not to find any indul)itable 

 specimens of this in the sand pits. I hope other collectors will look 

 for it. Bahamas.

preceding. A prominent, whitish, inflated ridge, appearing hke a 

 second peristome, occm-s behind the peristome. Aperture propor- 

 tionately more contracted than that of V. ovata; set mth a parietal, 

 an angular and a columellar lamella ; and with two palatal and a basal 

 fold. The palatal folds are prominent, the upper one shghtly double- 

 topped, the lower one more immersed and entering spirally. The 

 parietal lamella is stout and blimt; the angular lamella smaller and 

 thinner; the columellar lamella and the basal fold low and blunt. 

 Peristome rather thin, expanded, and notched opposite the upper 

 palatal fold, as in V. ovata. 



Alt. 1.7, diam. .9 mm. 



In one specimen there appears a slight suprapalatal denticle. A 

 considerable number of smaller, more globose specimens seem to belong 

 to this species. One of these from locahty 806 measures 1.4 x .9 mm. 



I have assumed that this species is more closely related to V. ovata 

 than to an}^ of the species reported from the West Indies. 



Locahties 806 and 807; the type from 806. 



This is the common fossil Vertigo. 



Vertigo marki n. sp. PL XXXVI, fig. 7. 



Shell rimate, ovate, yellowish-corneous, faintly striatulate; whorls 

 nearly 5, rather convex. Apex obtuse, but not rounded like that of 

 Vertigo numellata. The inflated ridge inconspicuous, whitish, crowded 

 close to the peristome. Apertiu-e ovate, much longer than in Vertigo 

 numellata, set ^sith four denticles, of which the parietal lamella is the 

 largest. The lower palatal fold denticular, smaller than that of Vertigo 

 numellata and less immersed; the upper palatal fold minute; and the 

 columellar lamella broad and low. The peristome is expanded, white, 

 strongly thickened within, hardly notched at the upper palatal fold. 



Alt. 1.9, diam. 1 mm. 



Named in honor of Dr. E. L. Mark, of Harvard, Director of the

This species is somewhat suggestive of V. tridentata, but is a little 

 slenderer, with a longer aperture, and a hea^y white peristome.

I got one indubitable specimen from locality 809, but it went to 

 pieces in my hands. I found only two or three recent ones. Mr, 

 Owen Bryant, who was collecting at the same time, found a larger 

 nimiber. Eastern and Central North America, and some West Indian 

 islands. 

 Carychium bermudense n. sp. PI. XXXVI, figs. 11, 12. 



Shell almost regularly tapering, corneous-white, imperforate, finely 

 striate; whorls about o, increasing regularly, those of the spire very 

 convex, with deep sutures. Aperture quite obhque, obstructed by a 

 small parietal and a very minute, deeply placed columellar lamella. 

 Peristome broadly expanded and reflexed, thickened within by a white 

 callus, with a shght groove on its front face, and developed inward 

 to form a prominence slightly above the middle of the outer margin 

 (near the position of the upper palatal fold in Bifidaria). 



Alt. 1.8, diam. .9 mm. 



This species is very dissimilar to the slender Carychium jamaicense. 

 The shape of the aperture allies it more nearly to Carychium exiguum 

 of North America, but its heavy peristome is quite its own. 



It is one of the most abimdant fossil species, occurring in the red 

 earth of localities 806 and 807, and even in the sand that fills the larger 

 shells in the sand pits.

I should hke to suggest the name discoides, merely as a convenient 

 term by which to know the variation represented by the last two shells 

 (PI. XXX^"I. fig. 4). I must say, however, that this suggestion 

 would be unfortunate if it resulted in the division of the series ob- 

 tained from locality 814. It seems to me, rather, that some physio- 

 logical peculiarity has destroyed the diagnostic value of the elevation 

 of the spire. The upper whorls differ less than the lower, and in the 

 most elevated forms the sutiu-e of the later whorls is much below the 

 keel of the preceding whorl, as if the slant of the spiral had been 

 abnormally diverted downward. 



Poecilozonites nelsoni var. callosus n. var. PI. XXXVI, fig. 5. 



Shell smaller than the typical form, shiny, with heavy ribbed striae, 

 colored with a broad yellowish-brown peripheral band on a white 

 ground. Whorls a trifle more than nine, increasing regularly and very 

 gradually. The suture does not change its character nor become de- 

 flected from the peripheral hne of the preceding whorl. The usual 

 peripheral angle is almost obsolete. The base has a stronger angle 

 about the umbilical perforation than is usual in the species. The 

 peristome is greatly thickened on the inside from 1 mm. at the suture 

 to fully 2 mm. near the columella. A prominent callosity covers the 

 parietal wall of the aperture. 



Alt. 24. diam. 33 mm. 



The combination of small size and large number of whorls is charac- 

 teristic. The ratio of height to diameter is more constant than in 

 the typical form, and the tendency to produce the callosity is very 

 marked. 



Type from locality 818, others from 818 and 807. 



The stability of the variety, occurring as it does m the oldest and 

 the latest formations, is the most interesting thing about it. It is also 

 my excuse for regarding such slight distinctions in a remarkably vari- 

 able species. 



I suppose the color patterns of Poecilozonites nelsoni were essentially 

 the same as those on the living Poecilozonites bermudensis. For ex- 

 ample, the type specimen of callosus probably had a dark brown band 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 417 



on a background of a yellowish cuticular color. The depressed speci- 

 men which is figured has traces of a subperipheral band, a supra- 

 peripheral line, and radial flaming above this hne. This flamed pat- 

 tern appears in several of the flat specimens. 



Poecilozonites cupula n. sp. PI. XXXVI, fig. 2. 



Shell sohd, dome-shaped, with somewhat flattened base, perforate, 

 strongly striate; pale, shiny-corneous, with subsutural and subper- 

 ipheral bands of darker color, and faint traces of two narrow bands 

 on the periphery, WHiorls 7f, a Uttle convex, increasing slowly; the 

 last vaguely angulate at the periphery. The apertiu-e is somewhat 

 quadrangular on account of the straight, vertical coliunella and the 

 peripheral angle. The peristome is simple, thin, with the columellar 

 margin reflexed. 



Alt. 13 Diam. 16 mm. 



The last specimen has 8f whorls. 



The type was selected as the best-preserved specimen, not as the 

 most representative example. The majority of the specimens have 

 a more roimded base and periphery, giving the peristome a more oval 

 contour. The height of the shell and the absence of a keel distinguish 

 it readily from P. bermudensis zonatus, and the verj' round dome 

 and less angulate periphery separate it from immature specimens of 

 nelsoni. 

 Poecilozonites dalli n. sp. PI. XXXVI, fig. 1. 



Shell elevated, with roimded apex and convex base, perforate. Its 

 surface is polished, with incremental lines less pronounced than those 

 of P. cupula; milky-white, with a yellowish-brown band below the 

 periphery and a line above the periphery. The first four whorls are 

 translucent whitish. Whorls 7^; all but the final whorl are flat as if 

 keeled, that one has a blunt peripheral ridge, below which it is deeply 

 roimded. The aperture is quite oblique, round-lunate. The peris- 

 tome is simple, except at the columella, which it joins without an angle, 

 but the columellar margin is reflexed, partly covering the perforation.

Another specimen has the height 10, diam. 7 mm., and is composed 

 of 9 whorls. It shows more of the bro\\Ti and less of the white color. 



The extreme variabihty of P. cupula leaves it debatable whether 

 this may not be a dwarf race of that species. 



No specimens of this form were found last summer, and it is through 

 the courtesy of Dr. William H. Dall of the National Museum, that I 

 am able to describe and figure it. The specim.ens came to him without 

 labels, so that we are left to conjecture their age. The slender specimen 

 is so glossy and brightly colored that Dr. Dall doubts whether it can 

 be a fossil, but it seems to me the simpler hj'pothesis to suppose that 

 it w^as preserved in the sand in the same manner as the Iy?q of P. nelsoni 

 callosus, which it so closely resembles in color and pohsh. The shell 

 sand seems to be a complete protection from destructive agents. On 

 this hypothesis it had originally about the color of Poecilozonites ber- 

 mudensis. 

 Poecilozonites bermudensis Pfr. 



Pilsbry^ Proc. Acad. Xat. Sci. Phila., 1888, p. 289; 1889, p. 85. 

 The typical variety seems to be of recent origin. It is distinguished 

 from the fossil by a less rounded upper surface, less flattened apex, 

 larger umbihcal perforation, and usually smaller number of whorls. 

 My largest specimen I found on Rabbit Island, Harrington Sound, 

 buried under drift sand at some time pre\dous to the cultivation of 

 the island. It measures alt. 13, diam. 24.5 mm. The largest and 

 smallest h\'ing mature shells measure as follows : 



Alt. 14.5 Diam. 20. mm. 

 14 22 



10 16.5 



An average fully adult specimen measures : 



Alt. 11 Diam. 20 Umb. 1.7 mm. 



and has a trifle more than 7 whorls. 

 Poecilozonites bermudensis var. zonatus Verr. PI. XXXVI, fig. 3. 



This differs from the type of the species in possessing an almost 

 imiformly ciu-ved upper contour hne, an almost flat apex, and a more 

 constricted umbihcus. The keel is distinct, as in the recent form. 

 Whorls 7f . The aperture is surrounded by callous thickenings as in 

 P. nelsoni callosus. Alt. 13.5, diam. 23, umb. 1 mm. 



Specimens come from locahties Nos. 806, 808. 814, 816 and 809. 



The extremes from locality No. 808 are : 



Alt. 16 Diam. 22.5 mm. 



15 25 



12.5 20.5 Umb. 1 mm. wide. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 419 



Thus the smallest adult is quite equal to the average recent shells. 

 A few selected specimens of the fossil and recent shells can hardly be 

 distinguished. Many of the fossils do not have the callosity. 



Locahty 816 has great quantities of these shells so firmly cemented 

 together that most of them are worthless as specimens. They have 

 the peculiar spheroidal upper surface, but the perforation is T\'ider 

 than in the series from localitj^ 808 — not so wdde, however, as in the 

 recent. Several specimens here occur below some fragments of Poedlo- 

 zonites nelsoni in stalagmite, apparently showing that they were there 

 previous to the extinction of nelsoni. 



Broken and immature specimens from locality 808 show that the 

 umbilicus was not much narrower than that of the recent variety until 

 the last whorl had commenced to grow. The pecuhar contour is also 

 less noticeable prior to the last whorl. Thus in their smaller number of 

 whorls, their less rounded contour, and their larger umbihcus, the 

 present snails seem like an undeveloped or degenerate race of the 

 former species. 



It is possible that this fossil variety is what Pfeiffer {Monographia, 

 I, p. 80) mistook for Helix ochroleuca Fer.

I found this species in every deposit examined except No. 807. 

 Further search would doubtless show it there also. At locality 815 

 man}^ fine specimens were embedded in stalagmite. They show the 

 typical color-pattern, with the dark marks changed as usual to reddish, 

 and the fighter ground to ivory-yellow.

The species is not so uniformly common as Poecilozonites circum- 

 firmatus, but is very abundant in some places, for example, near 

 locahty 806. It would be interesting to learn whether its place in the- 

 economy of nature is different from that of the following species.

 291. 



The modem variety comes from both formations at locahty 806, 

 and from Sl-t and 808. Those from locahty 808 are some of them more 

 keeled than is now usual. A series of poor specimens from No. 807 

 seem to bridge the gap from these to var. discrepans. 



This species has lost less in size than the others of its genus. My 

 largest fossil, coming from locality 808, has alt. 7, diam. 12 mm. My 

 largest recent shell has alt. 7, diam. 11.5 mm. I think the fossils 

 average larger than the adults of the recent shells, but it is not 

 easy to ehminate the immature of either.

 Some from 818 are extremely flat and carinate, one of them having 

 alt. 4.8, diam. 10.5 mm. If this were the only locahty that jdelded 

 the variety it would midoubtedly rank as a distinct species. 



I should Uke to raise the question whether Poecilozonites discrepans 

 is not one of the extinct varieties. I beheve it has not been treated 

 as such heretofore, but none were found last summer any more recent 

 than those from this sand pit. 

 Eaconulus turbinatus n. sp. PI. XXXVI, figs. 8, 9, 10. 



Shell acutely conic, with contoiu- very sUghtly convex; minutely per-

 with microscopic spirals. Apex rounded off abruptly. "WTiorls 7^, 

 not convex, narrow, the last strongly angulate at the periphery. 

 Suture simple, hardly impressed. Base rather flat, not excavated. 

 Aperture almost quadrangular, but with the angle at the columella 

 indefinite. Columella slightly curved, the columellar margin narrowly 

 reflexed. Alt. 3.4, diam. 2.8 mm. (from locality (807) ; diam. 3 mm. 

 (from locahty 808). 



From locahties Xos. 807, 806, 814, 816, 808, and 818. 



The above description is a composite. The general form is described 

 from the specimen from locality 807, but the sculpture is that of the 

 best specimen from 806, which should, perhaps, be considered the type, 

 and the base and aperture are taken from the specimen from 808. 

 From 814 comes the longitudinal section of one 3.8 x 2.8 mm., with an 

 uausually convex contoiu-. 



The genus Euconulus is, of course, not wholly satisfactory for this 

 species.

 regularly spaced, coinciding with growth lines. The spaces between

 crosses these lines and gives the costulse a slightly tubercular appear-

 turned provisionally to the name bermudensis. Its presence as a fossil 

 makes it not unhkely that it may be proved distinct from S. barbadensis. 

 This is another species that was formerly larger than now. The largest 

 fossil, from locality 808, measm-es alt. 13, diam, 7 mm. The largest 

 out of 30 recent specimens lent by Mr. Bryant has alt. 12, diam. 6.3 mm.

If this species were indigenous we could expect it to be as abundant

 from the beds I examined. The evidence seems to me strong that its 

 real home is elsewhere.

A REVISION OF THE MAMMALIAN GENUS MACBOTUS. 

 BY JAMES A. G. REHK. 



During the preparation of this paper a series of one hundred and 

 eighty-five specimens have been examined, seventy-six preserved as 

 skins, the remainder being in alcohol. This interesting collection, 

 representing the material of this genus preserved in the leading Ameri- 

 can institutions, was from the following collections : ninety-two from 

 the Biological Sm-vey of the U. S. Department of Agricultvire, fifty 

 from the U. S. National Museum, thirty-one from the American Mu- 

 seimi of Natural History, five from the Field Columbian Museum, 

 and the remainder from the collection of the Academy. The author 

 wishes to thank Drs. C. Hart Merriam, J, A. Allen and D. G. ElHot, 

 and Mr. G. S. Miller, Jr., of the above institutions, for their kindness 

 in permitting the use of specimens, and also for replies to inquiries 

 regarding the same.

 united; tragus lanceolate; uropatagium large; tail long, projecting 

 somewhat beyond the posterior margin of the uropatagium. which 

 completely envelopes it but the free apex; calcanea short and stout. 

 Skull -^-ith the rostrum moderately long, considerably lower than the

Distribution. — Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and a number of the Bahama 

 Islands; Guatemala north to southern Cahfornia and Arizona, but 

 apparently not reaching the east coast of the mainland except in Yuca- 

 tan. 



History. — The genus Macrotus was founded by Gray on M. water- 

 housii from Haiti, and referred by him to the Phyllostomina close to the 

 genus Macrophyllum. Wagner, in the supplement to Schreber's monu- 

 mental work, placed Gray's genus in the Megadermata T\ith Megader- 

 ma, Rhinopoma, Nycteris and Nyctophilvs. In 1858 Baird described 

 the Californian M. calijornicus, and, probably folloT\nng Wagner, con- 

 sidered the genus a member of the subfamilj^ Megadermata. Saussure. 

 in 1860, in describing the Mexican M. mexicanus, referred the genus to 

 the group Phyllostomides, but Harrison AUen, in 1864, followed Wagner 

 and Baird, and considered it a member of the Megadermatidce. Gimd- 

 lach, in 1864, separated the small Cuban t3T)e as M. minor, w^hile Peters, 

 in 1865, considered the genus a member of his group Vampyri. Coues 

 and Yarrow, in 1875, placed the genus in the family Phyllostomatidoe , 

 in the section Vampyri, of which Dobson later placed it. In both of 

 these papers AI. californicus, mexicanus and waterhousii were consid- 

 ered identical. On the basis of several specimens from Guatemala, 

 Dobson separated a species which he called M. bocourtianiis. Harrison 

 Allen, in 1890, separated a form of the genus from the State of JaUsco. 

 Mexico, as M. hnUeri, comparing it -u-ith M. californicus: the same 

 author, in the 1894 edition of his Monograph, defended his statement 

 made in 1864, that M. calijornicus was distinct from the West Indian 

 waterhousii. Lyddeker, in 1891, believing that the name Mocrotis 

 Dejean invahdated Macrotus Gray, proposed the name Otopterus to 

 replace Gray's term. This action was criticised later by True and 

 Harrison Allen, who held that Macrotis was little used and in construc- 

 tion differed from Macrotus. 



General Relations. — As little satisfactorj- material of the alhed genera 

 is available, no critical remarks as to the relationship of the genus can 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 429 



be made. It is without doubt a member of the present Phyllosto- 

 matince, but that it is not worthy of separation from some of the types 

 of this division is not so certain. The genus LoncJwrhina does not 

 appear to the author to be as close an ally as Dobson's work would 

 lead one to suppose; and taking the allied genera broadly, Macrotus 

 appears to be a ven*- distinct type, not differentiated as strongly by 

 ekull characters as by some external developments.

 latter exposed on the thinly furred interscapular region; posterior 

 margin and short fm- on the basal portion of the ears white ; below fawn 

 color, with a silvery ''bloom" caused by the silvery-white tips of the

ed, the longitudinal curve low, sagittal crest distinct and sharp; inter- 

 orbital region shghtly constricted ; zygomata prominent, slightly more 

 expanded posteriorly than anteriorly. Rostrmn attenuate, the ante- 

 rior width (taken behind the canines) not less than the interorbital 

 ■width, the dorsal outhne continuing, but less distinctly, the regular 

 descending course from the summit of the brain-case ; palate shghtly 

 vaulted, posterior portion with parallel sides, the median cleft with a 

 sub-truncate apex; pterygoids very slender apically, moderately 

 flaring. Mandible rather heavy, the rami strong ; ascending rami stout,

 external face distinctly channeled ; upper canines projecting anteriorly, 

 shghtly recm-ved; first upper premolar elongate-elliptical in basal 

 outhne, advanced upon and crowding the canine, cusp anterior, low 

 and followed by a jagged cutting edge and distinct cingulum; second 

 upper premolar oblong in basal outline, anterior section narrowed 

 considerably, cusp distinct, subcaninif orm ; first upper molar sub- 

 quadrate, the paracone-metacone ridge distinct and with the two arms 

 distinctly acute at the metacone, protocone as a low blunt ridge, hypo- 

 cone almost obsolete, cingulum very weak; second upper molar similar 

 to the first in character, but larger, distinctly quadrate and with the

Skull of adult male: Total length 26.8 mm.; greatest zygomatic 

 width 12.3; interorbital \\ddth 4.9; height at base of second premolar 4; 

 height of brain-case 9.3; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygo- 

 mata 10; width of palatal constriction 2.3; length of palate from an- 

 terior foramina 11 ; ^ddth of palate including teeth 8.1 ; greatest length

Remarks. — True M. waterhousii can readily be distinguished by the 

 character given in the key. From the mainland forms the heavier 

 posterior limbs and the stronger skull and teeth will distinguish it. 

 From w. minor the Haitian form can readily be separated by the paler 

 coloration as well as the much greater size ; from w. jamaicensis by the 

 larger size and heavier teeth; from w. compressus by the broader 

 rostrum as well as the subquadrate fh'st lower premolar.

 [Haiti; St. Domingo; Jamaica.] (Part.) 



Type.— Adult 9 ; Spanishtown, Jamaica. Xo. -if~%, U, S. Na- 

 tional Museum. Collected by William Thomas March. 



Distribution. — The island of Jamaica, where according to Gosse 

 {vide supra) it is one of the commonest bats. Osborn, in Dobson {vide 

 supra), states that "when inhabiting houses these bats always Uve in 

 the cellars below ground, they are never found in the roofs." 



General Characters.— SimilsiT to the Haitian M. luaterhousii, but 

 differing in the duller coloration, the smaller skull and narrower and 

 weaker upper tooth-row. 



Head. — Ear quite large, much as in M. icaterhousii , but the size is 

 greater, and the transverse phcse more distinct ;- connecting membrane 

 rather high and with a distinct central emargination ; tragus as in M. 

 waterhousii, but the apex is bkmter. Nose-leaf and nose-pad broad, 

 the leaf acuminate with the apex rather broad and blunt. Lower Hp 

 with the pad trigonal, the median cleft deep and very distinct. 



Limbs. — The forearm and tibia are structurally as in M. waterhousii. 

 but of slightly larger size; the thumb and foot are, on the other hand, 

 of smaller size. Calcanea short and stout. Tail distinctly projecting 

 beyond the interfemoral membrane. 



Fur. — Essentially as in M. waterhousii. 



^ This is hardly visible in the type skin, but quite distinct in alcohoUc speci- 

 mens.

Color. — Above Prout's brown, the hair with sUghth' more than the 

 basal half white. Below between drab and wood brown, the hair 

 with the basal half white. Ears and uropatagium Prout's brown, 

 endopatagium, mesopatagium and the greater portion of the ecto- 

 patagium clove brown. 



Skull. — Similar to that of M. icaterhousii, but slightly smaller. 

 Teeth. — Similar to M. icaterhoitsii, but narrower and not strongly- 

 crowded ; second upper premolar separated from the first premolar by 

 a distinct space. 



Measurements. — Type: Total length 90.2 mm.; head and body 63.2; 

 ear 23; greatest width of ear 16; tragus 8.5; forearm 54.5; thumb 14.1; 

 third digit 92; tibia 23.5; foot 13; tail 27. 



Average of series: Total length [10] 93.8 mm. (90.2-103); head and 

 body [10] 60.6 (57-67) ; head [9] 26 (25.5-27.5) ; ear [10] 26.3 (23-29) ; 

 greatest width of ear [10] 18.5 (16-20.5); tragus [10] 8.8 (8-9.5); fore- 

 arm [10] 53.4 (52-54.5); thumb [10] 13.4 (12-15); third digit [10] 90.3 

 (88-94); tibia [10] 22.3 (21.5-24); calcaneum [9] 10.4 (9.2-12); foot 

 [10] 13.6 (12.2-16); tail [10] 33.1 (27-36). 



Type skull: Greatest zygomatic width 12.2 mm.; interorbital width 

 4.3 ; height at base of second premolar 4.1 ; breadth of brain-case above 

 roots of zygomata 9.5; width of palatal constriction 2.4; length of 

 palate 11; width of palate including teeth 7.8; greatest length of 

 mandible 16.5. 



Average of three skulls : Total length [2] 24.3 mm. (24.2-24.5) ; greatest 

 zygomatic width 12 (12-12.2) ; interorbital width 4.2 (4.1-4.3) ; height

 width of palate with teeth 7.9 (7.8-8) ; greatest length of mandible 16.1 

 (16-16.5). • 



Remarks. — This form requires comparison with but one other, true 

 M. ivaterhousii, from wliich the compressed and spaced tooth-row will 

 readily distinguish it. The external characters are also of service, the 

 longer forearm and tibia and smaller foot being distinctive. From 

 M. w. compressus and minor the characters given in the key will enable 

 one to separate it without difficulty. 



Specimens Examined. — Twelve; one skin, eleven alcoholic indi- 

 viduals.

Macrotus waterhousii compressus n. subsp. 



Type.— Adult 9 ; Eleuthera, Bahamas. No. 122,484, U. S. Na- 

 t i 021 al Museum. July 6, 1903. CoUectedby S. H, Derickson. 



Distribution. — Specimens have been examined from Eleuthera, New 

 Providence, Long Island and Conch Sound, Andros, Bahamas. 



General Characters. — Similar to Macrotus waterhousii and M. iv. 

 jamaicensis, but differing in the quite narrow rostrum (which is an- 

 teriorly narrower than the interorbital region) and elongate-elliptical 

 first lower premolar. 



Head. — Similar to M. ?r. jamaicensis, except that the nose-leaf and 

 nose-pad appear to be slightly narrower and slenderer. This character 

 appears to be only an average one, however, as the series shows con- 

 siderable variation. 



Limbs. — Similar to M. w. jamaicensis, but the forearm, tibia, third 

 digit and tail average smaller, while the foot averages larger. In the 

 latter respect compressus approaches true icaterhousii, as their respect- 

 ive distribution would lead one to suppose, from which the limbs show 

 practically no differential characters. 

 Fur. — Essentially as in M. luaterhousii and M. w. compressus. 

 Color. — ^Above Front's brown, the hair wdth more than the basal 

 half white; fur at the base of ears and along the internal margins whit- 

 ish. Below the hair is white basaUy, ringed with pale drab, and tipped 

 with silvery-white. Membranes sepia, the ears and uropatagium paler 

 than the other portions. 



Skull. — Similar to that of M. iv. jamaicensis, but with the anterior 

 portion of the rostrum narrower than the interorbital region. The 

 skull of true waterhousii can readily be separated, as it is of considerably 

 greater size. The mandible is also seen to be slenderer than in either 

 the Haitian or Jamaican form. 



Teeth. — Similar to M. w. jamaicensis, but with the first upper pre- 

 molar narrower and more elongate, and the first lower premolar is 

 distinctly elongate-elliptical in basal outline instead of subquadrate. 

 The teeth are distinctly weaker than in M. icaterhousii, the latter 

 having a very heavy robust dentition. 



Measurements. — Type: Total length 94 mm.; head and body 69; 

 ear 24; greatest width of ear 18; tragus 8.5; forearm 52; thumb 13.5; 

 third digit 85; tibia 21; calcaneum 11; foot 13; tail 25 



Average of series: Total length [8] 96.7 mm. (88-98); head'and body 

 [8] 64.5 (59-69) ; head [4] 25 (24-26) ; ear [8] 26 (23-29.5)*; greatest 

 width of ear [8] 18.8 (17-21.5) ; tragus [8] 8.9 (7.5-10) ; forearm [8] 52.1 

 (49.5-54); thumb [7] 13.9 (12.8-16); third digit [7] 88.7 (84-106);

tibia [7] 21.2 (20-23.5); calcaneum [7] 10.4 (9.3-11); foot [8] 14.4 

 (13-16.8); tail [8] 30.9 (25-33.5). 



Skull of type: Total length 25 mm.; greatest zygomatic width 10.6; 

 interorbital 4.3 ; height at base of second premolar 4.1 ; height of brain- 

 case 8.6; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 8.5; width'of 

 palatal constriction 2.3; length of palate I I ; width of palate (includ- 

 ing teeth) 7.6 ; greatest length of mandible^ 1 7. 



Average of four skulls: Total length 25 vrnn. (25-25.1); greatest 

 zygomatic wddth 11.6 (10.6-12); interorbital width 4.3 (4.2-4.5); 

 height at base of second premolar 4 (4-4.1); height of brain-case 8.3 

 (8-8.6); breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9 (8.5-9.5); 

 width of palatal constriction 2.2 (2.1-2.3); length of palate 10.6 

 (10.5-11); width of palate (including teeth) 7.5 (7.5-7.6); greatest 

 length of mandible 16.9 (16.8-17). 



Remarks. — The Bahaman form in general appearances approaches 

 closer to true waterhousii than to w. jamaicensis, but the skull and teeth 

 are decidedly different from the Haitian type and approach the 

 Jamaican form. Taken as a whole, however, the Bahaman race is 

 quite distinct from any other form of the genus.

[Guanajay, El Cobre, Cuba; Nueva Gerona, Isle of Pines.] (Not of Gray.) 



Type Locality. — Cuba. From remarks made by Gundlach in a later 

 paper {vide supra) we learn that his material was from western Cuba. 



Distribution. — Cuba and the Isle of Pines. Gundlach says it is a 

 common species in some warehouses and caves, where individuals 

 pass the day side by side suspended by the hind limbs. 



General Characters. — A member of the Macrotus waterhousii group 

 but readily separated by the smaller size and the deeper coloration. 

 The Cuban form is such a distinct type, with small hght skull and 

 weak teeth, that it hardly requires comparison. 




436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Head. — Essentially as in M. waterhousii jamaicensis. 



Limbs. — As in M. w. jamaicensis, but slightly smaller. 



Fur. — As in the other forms of the icaterhousii group, except that the 

 furring of the base and proximal part of the internal margin of the ear 

 is more marked than in any other form. 



Color. — Apparently two extreme types of coloration exist in this 

 form, which may be sexual, but the available material is not in condi- 

 tion to justif}'' any statement beyond the fact that the two phases exist. 

 The one extreme is a deep brown, while the other (represented by but 

 one skin) is a rather dark ferruginous. Two specimens have a slight 

 tendency toward the ferruginous type, the upper surface being slightly 

 suffused with that tint while the lower surface is that of the bro-^ni 

 form. Brown phase : Above seal bro-^ii, the hair wdth slightly more 

 than the basal half white, region between the ears and posterior to 

 the connecting membrane blackish; below the hair is wliite basally, 

 then conspicuously annulate with drab and rather obsciu-ely tipped 

 ■^ith silvery; membranes blackish-brown. This type is distinctly 

 darker, both above and below, than any of the other West Indian forms. 

 Red phase : Above and below dull ferruginous, the hair unicolor ; patch 

 between the ears blackish ; membranes black. In one of the apparently 

 intermediate specimens mentioned above, the hair of the upper surface 

 is whitish basally with a median annulation of smoke gray. 



Skull. — Of the general type of M. icaterhousii, but distinctly smaller 

 than any of the related forms. As specimens from the eastern part 

 of Cuba approximate slightly toward the Jamaican type, a slight differ- 

 ence in size is noticed in comparing the skulls of individuals from the 

 two extremes of the island. 



Teeth. — Essentially as in M. u\ jamaicensis, but the first upper pre- 

 molar is slightly narrower and the lower premolars are distinctly more 

 longitudinal and compressed. This latter character alone will immedi- 

 ately demonstrate the fact that while specimens from the eastern part 

 of the island slightly approach jamaicensis, they are inseparable from 

 typical minor from western Cuba, when the dentition is considered. 



Measurements. — Average of twelve specimens: Total length 90.7 

 mm. (84.5-96.5); head and body 59.9 (55.5-65); head 25.1 (25-30); 

 ear 26.3 (21.5-30); greatest width of ear 17.3 (15-19); tragus 8.6 

 (7.8-10) ; forearm 51.4 (49-54) ; thumb 14.1 (12.5-15) ; third digit 85.1 

 (81-88) ; tibia 21.2 (19-22.5); calcaneum 10.9 (8.5-12.3); foot 13 

 (10.5-15.5); tail 30 (20-37). 



Average of five skulls: Total length 23.8 mm. (23.5-24.3); greatest 

 zygomatic width 11.3 (11-12); interorbital width 3.9 (3.5-4.1); height 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 437 



at base of second premolar 3.8 (3.5-4) ; height of brain-ease 8.3 (8-8.8) ; 

 breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 9.1 (9-9.2); width of 

 palatal constriction 2.1 (2-2.2); length of palate 9.7 (9.2-10); width 

 of palate (including teeth) 7.3 (7-8); greatest length of mandible 15.4 

 (15-16). 



Remarks. — The Cuban form minor is quite distinct from any of the 

 related forms except the Jamaican Macrotus icaterhousii jamaicensis. 

 The specimens from eastern Cuba somewhat approach this latter race, 

 as already noticed by Gundlach {vide supra), but the general charac- 

 ters of the race are retained and the smaller size and weaker teeth, as 

 well as the deeper coloration, will serve to distinguish the two races.

Tijpe Locality. — Cuautla, near Yautepec, Morelos, ]\Iexico, 



Distribution. — From Colima, Michoacan, and Morelos, Mexico, south 

 to Vera Paz, Guatemala. 



General Characters. — Size large; ears rather large; Hmbs robust; 

 skull heavy, the rostrum not narrower than the interorbital region; 

 teeth heavy, the first upper premolar moderately compressed, the 

 third lower premolar somewhat crowded. 



Head. — Ear, when stretched forward, extending beyond the muzzle 

 a distance not exceeding the length of the nose-leaf; internal margin 

 strongly arcuate basally, gently so apically; apex rather narrowly 

 rounded; external margin slightly curved, basal notch distinct, basal 

 lobe rather low; tragus lanceolate, apex acuminate, external basal

lobe low; internal connecting membrane rather high, with a slight 

 median emargination. Nose-leaf acute; nose-pad with the inferior 

 margin more or less free; nostrils crescentic. Pad on the lower jaw 

 trigonal, median incision of varying depth, but usually rather broad 

 and shallow. 



Limbs. — Forearm long and heav}', with a distinct and even arcuation. 

 Posterior limbs moderately robust (for the genus), femora and tibiae of 

 equal length ; foot about half the length of the femur, rather heavy ; 

 calcaneum thick and flattened. Tail rather long, one or one and a 

 half terminal joints free. 



Membranes and Fur. — Essentially as in the waterhousii group. 



Color. — Two color phases are present in the series examined — one 

 dark brown the other of a more rufescent type — between which two 

 extremes arc a number of intermediate specimens. Dark brown phase : 

 Above bistre with a shght overlying silvery ''bloom," the basal three- 

 fifths of the hair white; below wood brown, the hair with the basal 

 section as above, the whole with the tips of the hair white; hair at 

 the base of the ears and the auricular hairs whitish; membranes bistre. 

 Rufous brown phase: Above cinnamon, slightly more than the basal 

 half of the hair white ; below the hair white basally, then ringed mth 

 cinnamon, and tipped with ecru drab, thus producing a paler color 

 than that of the upper surface ; hair at the base of the ears and auricular 

 hairs whitish; membranes mummy brown. 



Skull. — Similar to M. waterhousii, but slightly smaller, with the inter- 

 orbital region more depressed and the rostrum slightly slenderer. 



Teeth. — As in M. waterhousii, except that the canines are distinctly 

 weaker, the first upper premolar is more compressed, the second upper 

 premolar shghtly longer, and the lower tooth-row more compressed. 



Measurements. — Average of four Cuernavaca specimens: Total 

 length 93.1 mm. (87-101); head and body 59.8 (56.5-64); head 24; 

 ear 25.2 (24-27); greatest width of ear 17.7 (17-18.5); tragus 9.2 

 (9-9.6); forearm 49.6 (47.5-51.5); thumb 12.5 (11.5-13); third digit 

 87.1 (85.5-90); tibia 21.2 (21-21.5); calcaneum 10.3 (9-11.3); foot 

 12.7 (11.8-13); tail 33.5 (30-37). 



Average of eight Tehuantepec skins : Total length [1] 100.5 mm. ; head 

 and body 60.9 (57-69) ; head [1] 29.2; ear 26 (24-28.5) ; greatest \ridth 

 of ear [3] 18.8 (17.9-19.5); tragus 8.5 (8-10); forearm 52.5 (51-53.5); 

 thumb [7] 12.3 (12-13.5); third digit [5] 87.8 (87-89); tibia 22.2 

 (20-23.5); calcaneum 10 (9-11); foot 13.1 (13-13.5); tail [1] 31.5. 



Average of eight skulls from Tehuantepec and Reyes, Oaxaca: Total 

 length 24.8 mm. (24-25.5); greatest zygomatic width 12 (11.5-12,5); 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 439 



interorbital width 4.1 (3.9-4.5); height at base of second premolar 3.7 

 (3.5-3.9); height of brain-case 9 (8.1-9.5); breadth of brain-case at 

 roots of zygomata 9.2 (9-9.6) ; width of palatal constriction 2.2 (2-2.5) ; 

 length of palate 9.4 (9-9.8); width of palate (including teeth) 8 

 (7.9-8.2); greatest length of mandible 16.4 (16-17.6). 



Remarks. — The Macrotiis mexicanus group is closely related to the 

 West Indian waterhousii group, from which, however, it can be dis- 

 tinguished by the characters mentioned above. The slenderer build, 

 larger ears and lighter skull will at once separate M. calif ornicus from 

 this form, while the race hulleri is a smaller type of the rnexicanus 

 character quite easily recognized. 



Dobson's Macrotus hocourtianus is, no doubt, simply the extreme 

 development of this form, and his measurements are almost identical 

 with those of the type of mexicanus given by Saussure. Specimens 

 from Tehuantepec average larger than Morelos specimens, but some 

 specimens in the same series are smaller than Cuernavaca individuals, 

 and as no other characters appear to be at variance, they should be 

 considered extreme mexicanus. Many of Dobson's measurements of 

 hocourtianus are smaller than the average of four Cuernavaca specimens 

 examined, and in several cases are actually smaller than the same 

 measurements of Saussure's type.

General Characters. — Similar to M. mexicanus, but smaller, with the 

 dentition more crowded, and the second upper premolar shorter and 

 somewhat weaker. 



Head. — As in M. mexicanus, except that the ears are larger. 



Limbs. — As in M. mexicanus, but rather slenderer, the foot and cal- 

 caneum distinctly weaker. 



Membranes and Fur. — As in M. mexicanus. 



Color. — This race occurs in two phases, one of which appears to be 

 that of immaturity. The dark brown type, w^hich is apparently the 

 immature coloration, is connected by intermediates with the dull 

 rufescent brown type. Brown phase : Above bistre, the hair with the 

 basal half white; base of ears and auricular hairs whitish; below drab, 

 the hair white at the base and tipped with silvery-white ; membranes 

 clove brown. Red phase: Above between chestnut and hazel (Ridg- 

 way's Nomenclature of Colors, pi. iv), the hair light and rather vinaceous 

 basally ; base of ears and auricular hairs of the under color of the upper 

 surface; below dull pinkish vinaceous; membranes between chestnut 

 and liver brown. The intermediate specimens have the upper surface 

 cinnamon rufous, while of this type has the extreme base of the hair 

 smoke-gray, thus making the hair triannulate— smoke gray, white and 

 cinnamon rufous. The original series of this race was composed 

 entirely of immature individuals and accordingly all are of the dark 

 brown type. 



Skull. — Very similar to that of M. mexicanus, but distinctly smaller, 

 with the rostrum, for its size, heavier. 



Teeth. — As in M. mexicanus, but the second upper premolar is with- 

 out the produced anterior shoulder noticed in mexicanus, and the 

 inferior premolars are comparatively shorter and broader. 



Measurements. — Average of five alcoholic topotypes: Total length 

 87.6 mm. (84.5-92); head and body 55.1 (53.5-56.5); head 23 (22^5- 

 23.5); ear 28.5 (27-30.5); greatest width of ear 19.2 (18.5-20.5); tra- 

 gus 9.5 (9-10); forearm 49.2 (48.5-50.5); thumb 12.6 (12-13.2); third 

 digit 83.8 (81-87); tibia 20.2 (19-21); calcaneum 10.6 (10-11.2); foot 

 12.4 (12-13); tail 32.5 (30.5-35.5). 



Average of eleven topotypic and Guadalajara skulls : Total length 23 

 mm. (22.5-23.5) ; greatest zygomatic width 10.8 (10.5-11.1) ; interorbital 

 width 4 (4-4.2); height at base of second premolar 3.6 (3.3-4); height 

 of brain-case 8.2 (8-9) ; breadth of brain-case above roots of zygomata 

 8.6 (8.3-9) ; width of palatal constriction 2 (2-2.3) ; length of palate 8.6 

 (8.3-9); width of palate (including teeth) 7.4 (7-7.8); greatest length 

 of mandible 15 (14.6-15.5).

Remarks. — This well-marked race of mcxicanus can be easily recog- 

 nized by the smaller size, the weak second upper and distinctly crowded 

 third lower premolars. The Tres Marias specimens appear to be 

 inseparable from the mainland form.

A MONOGRAPH OF THE GENUS DENDROCINCLA Gray. 



BY HARRY C. OBERHOLSER. 



The purpose of the mves-tigation whose results are set forth in the 

 following pages is to clear up to such degree as may be possible the 

 measurable uncertainty of identification attending the birds of the 

 genus Dendrocincla. This Dendrocolaptine group is composed en- 

 tirely of plainly attired species which present often but slight differ- 

 entiating characters ; and many of the original descriptions are both 

 so short and so unsatisfactory that the determination of their positive 

 identity is a matter sometimes of considerable difficulty. Individual 

 color variation is very marked in a few of the forms, occasionally 

 amounting to a greater degree of difference than that which distin- 

 guishes some entirely distinct species; and the sexes, though alike in 

 color, frequently differ wddely in size. The color of the bill, which some 

 writers have relied on to furnish specific distinctions, seems to change 

 ■^ath age, being darkest in immature birds. 



The name Deyidromancs^ under which Dr. Sclater proposed to sepa- 

 rate Dendrocincla anabatina and a few of the other small species, at 

 first generically,^ then subgenerically,- seems to have no standing other 

 than as a .simple synonym of Dendrocincla, since the alleged characters 

 do not prove to be significant; furthermore, there are no other struc- 

 tural differences among the species of the genus, aside from some com- 

 paratively slight variations in length of tail, and none of these seem 

 cause sufl^cient for even subgeneric division. 



For the purposes of the present review there have been available 

 examples of all the twenty forms here recognized, save two — the newly 

 described D. macrorhyncha and the well-known D. longicauda — com- 

 prising altogether considerably over 100 specimens. In a difficult 

 group like Dendrocincla the examination of types is of great value — 

 in many ca.ses of prime importance — and in this we have been fortunate 

 enough to handle the original specimens of D. tyrannina, D. atrirostris, 

 D. 0. lajresnayei, D. meruloides, D. rufo-olivacea, D. castanopiera and

The most important papers dealing with the species of this genus 

 appear to be as follows :

Although the present writer's work began with the collection of the 

 United States National Museum, including that of the Biological Sur- 

 vey, he is under great obligations to the authorities of the American 

 Museum of Natural History, and of the Boston Society of Natural 

 History, as well as to Mr. Outram Bangs, for the loan of material, with- 

 out which, particularly the valuable type specimens, it would have 

 been impossible to arrive at anything like satisfactor}- conclusions. To 

 Mr. Glover M. Allen he is also indebted for the verification of some 

 obscure references; and especially to ]\Ir. Ridgway, whose constantly 

 courteous assistance has contributed to make this paper much better 

 than it otherwise would have been.

This recently described species is the largest of the genus, and may

 it appears to be close to Dendrocincla tyrannina tyrannina, of which 

 it may prove through further research to be but a subspecies.

even to scarcely striated. Specimens examined, including one from 

 the type locality, and compared with the type and other examples of 

 tyrannina, show brunnea to be an easily recognizable race, which its 

 describers hastened unnecessarily to suppress.* There seems to be 

 no doubt, however, of its being only subspecifically distinct.

Evidently a very good species, though not seen, differing conspicu- 

 ously from Dendrocincla tyrannina in its reduced size, and particularly 

 by reason of its comparatively much longer tail.

Apparently a very distinct species, as pointed out by Mr. Ridgway,^ 

 though for some time confused with Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei, 

 but really much more closely allied to tyrannina and longicauda than 

 to either lafresnayei or olivacea. From D. tyrannina tyrannina it 

 differs principally in much smaller size ; rather paler upper and much 

 paler lower parts ; very conspicuous postoculai: stripe ; and the more 

 ashy chin and cheeks. The two types in the Lafresnaye collection 

 (Nos. 2,308 and 2,309) are the only specimens of this species that have 

 been examined. Both are apparently not quite adult, though fully 

 grown; one of them is considerably more olivaceous than the other, 

 but this seems undoubtedly to be only an individual difference. They 

 measure as follows:

The bird described by Pelzeln as Dendrocincla minor'' from San 

 Vicente, Matto Grosso. Brazil, which has hitherto remained unidenti- 

 fied, is undoubtedly the same as that previously called atrirostris by 

 Lafresnaye. This is evident from a comparison of the original descrip- 

 tion of minor with the types of atrirostris, which shows a perfect agree- 

 ment both in dimensions and other characters. Furthermore, San 

 Vicente, the type locaUty of minor, is in southwestern Brazil, not far 

 from Guarayos, Bolivia, whence came the first specimens of atrirostris. 

 This species appears to have a hmited distribution, being known from 

 only eastern Bolivia and Matto Grosso, Brazil, for all citations of 

 atrirostris from Ecuador and Colombia belong elsewhere. 



Dendrocincla anabatina anabatina Sclater.

Type Locality. — Omoa, Honduras. 



Geographical Distribution. — Southeastern Mexico (Vera Cruz) and 

 Guatemala to Panama. 



One of the most conspicuous forms of the genus. In a general way 

 it resembles Dendrocincla atrirostris. but may at once be distinguished 

 by its immaculate buffy or ochraceous buff chin, in sharp contrast to 

 the color of the breast; b}' the color of the outer webs of the'second- 

 aries, which is tawnj' or bright ta\\aiy-rufous, unique in the genus and 

 strikingly different from the oHve-brown of the wing-coverts or the 

 dark fuscous of the tips of the wing-quills; by a much shorter tail; as 

 well as by other less obvious characters. Birds from Panama are not 

 distinguishable either in size or color from those of Nicaragua or even 

 the States of Tabasco and Vera Cruz, Mexico; but those examined 

 from Guatemala are rather paler, though not sufficiently so to warrant 

 either their separation or their reference to tijphla. 

 Dendrocincla anabatina typhla, subsp. nov.

deep rufous on the upper tail-coverts ; tail chestnut ; -u-ing-quills chest- 

 nut along the shafts, dull rufous exteriorly, shading basally into buff 

 on their inner margins, and broadly tipped with fuscous; superior 

 wing-coverts rufescent olive-brown like the back; sides of head and 

 neck olive-brown mixed with ochraceous, the lores paler, and a notice- 

 able postocular stripe dull ochraceous; chin buff, shading gradually 

 into the raw-umber brown of the remainder of the lower surface; 

 jugulum with broad spots and shaft streaks of dull ochraceous ; longest 

 lower tail-coverts rufous; lining of wing ochraceous. Wing, 99, tail, 

 75, exposed culmen, 21, tarsus, 25, middle toe, 16.5. 



A local form of rather restricted distribution, specimens of which 

 have been examined from only Yucatan and Campeche, Mexico, those 

 from the latter locality being, however, indistinguishable from Yucatan 

 examples. The type of Dendrocincla anahatina anabatina came from 

 Omoa, Honduras, and although this is not far from the eastern part 

 of Yucatan, yet a specimen seen from La Puerta, Honduras, near the 

 type locahty, is decidedly different from typhla, and indistinguishable 

 from those taken in Guatemala, while one from Santa Ana, Honduras, is 

 still darker. This, therefore, fixes anabatina as the dark form, leaving 

 the Yucatan bird to be supplied with a name, as above.

Similar to D. atrirostris, from which, however, it may readily be dis- 

 tinguished by its much more olivaceous coloration both above and 

 below, as well as its lack of pale shaft streaks on the feathers of the 

 pileum. Its olivaceous colors separate it from also D. anabatina ana- 

 batina, and in other respects it differs from this form much as D. atri- 

 rostris does. Mr. Ridgway's Dendrocincla rufo-olivacea, which unfor- 

 tunately he was unable to compare with authentic examples of fuligi- 

 nosa, seems to be identical with D. fuliginosus, as some time ago con- 

 sidered by Sclater,-" so that unless more abundant material should 

 prove it a recognizable geographical race occupying the Amazon valley

from the vicinity of Santarem westward, it must be relegated to sjni- 

 onymy. The type and two other specimens from Diamantina, together 

 with one from Para. Brazil, which represent the material at Mr. Ridg- 

 way's disposal when describing rufo-oHvacea. have all been examined 

 in the present connection, and these alone, although the only specimens 

 now available, indicate a considerable amount of individual variation 

 in D. fuliginosa. The type of rufo-oUvacea and one other from Dia- 

 mantina are evidently much paler, more grajdsh below than ordinary 

 fuliginosa, and are quite different from the Para specimen, with which, 

 however, the third Diamantina example very closely agrees. 



Dendrocincla turdina (Lichtenstein).

 Resembling D. atrirostris, but apparently larger (^\-ing 100-107 mm.) ; 

 throat and sides of head more rufescent ; exposed svirf ace of wing-ciuills 

 duller, more olivaceous, not so much contrasted with the color of the 

 back; chin paler; ochraceous postocular stripe lacking. From D. 

 fuliginosa it differs in very much more rufescent upper and lower parts ; 

 smaller bill; and conspicuously pale-streaked pileum. 



In the Lafresnaye collection there are two specimens of this species 

 marked as the types; but this is evidently not quite correct, for thej'- 

 were probably nothing more than the specimens used for description 

 by Lafresnaye in his monograph of the genus Dendrocolaptes,^^ as the 

 species was originally named by Lichtenstein," and the real type is, 

 or should be, in the Berlin Museimi. where many, if not most, of Lich- 

 tenstein's types were deposited. Dr. Sclater records a specimen of 

 Dendrocincla turdina from Rio, Brazil.*- which is possibly to be referred 

 to D. enalincia, though without examination this is of course impossible 

 to determine. The decided variation in size among specimens of 

 this form examined b}' Dr. Sclater'^ is undoubtedly merely sexual.

 inner webs; mandible (in skin) less yellowish; lining of wing paler.

Upper surface rufescent olive-brown, the rump decidedly paler, the 

 longest superior tail-coverts chestnut, the feathers of pileum ^nth tawny 

 ochraceous shaft streaks which are most conspicuous anteriorly; tail 

 chestnut, the upper surface of the shafts brownish-black, the fifth pair 

 of tail feathers, counting from the outside, having the inner webs 

 broadly tipped with blackish, the same existing though to a less degree 

 on the fourth pair; inner webs of wing-quills basally chestnut, paler on 

 their margins; outer webs of primaries and broad terminal portions 

 on both vanes of primaries and secondaries fuscous, these tips largest on 

 the primaries, more narrow and confined largely to the inner webs on 

 the secondaries, almost absent on the tertials; remaining portions of 

 exterior webs of secondaries reddish olive-brown ; upper wing-coverts 

 olive-bro-^Ti like the back, though rather darker and duller; lores dull 

 grayish-brown, with buffy shaft streaks; cheeks and auriculars of 

 similar color, but somewhat darker and more rufescent, with buffy 

 shaft lines, these most conspicuous on the auriculars; sides of neck 

 like the back, but lighter and somewhat more grajdsh; chin wood- 

 brown; under tail-coverts light chestnut; remainder of lower parts 

 raw-umber brown, more grayish on the breast, lighter on the throat, 

 the feathers of which have buffy shafts; color of the throat passing 

 gradually into that of the paler chin and the darker sides of the head ; 

 lining of wing ochraceous-buff. Wing, 106 ; tail, 87; exposed culmen, 

 22; tarsus, 24; middle toe, 17. 



In a considerable series of typical Dendrocincla turdina, exhibiting 

 the usual amount of individual variation m depth and shade of color 

 to which members of this genus are commonly subject, there is no 

 specimen that can be considered intermediate between turdina and 

 enalincia. In view of this, as well as of the fact that in Dendrocincla 

 perfectly distinct species are often very much alike, enalincia, on ac- 

 count of its decided characters, has here been given full specific rank, 

 although it may in time prove to be but the southern subspecific 

 representative of D. turdina.

Type Locality. — Caj^enne, French Guiana. 



Geographical Distribution. — ^'alley of the Amazon, to eastern Peru; 

 north to British Guiana and the Orinoco river, Venezuela. 



This very distinct species resembles to some extent D. turdina, but 

 is darker above; very much darker, more olivaceous below; the throat 

 is more whitish; the pileum without pale shaft streaks; the wings are 

 clear chestnut instead of tinged with ohvaceous, being thus more con- 

 trasted with the color of the back; and the hning of the wing is darker. 



The specimen of this species in the Lafresnaye collection, marked 

 "type" (No. 2,304), is probably onty the specimen used by Lafresnaj-e 

 for descriptive purposes, as Lichtenstein's original example is still in 

 the Berhn Museum. Mr. Ridgway's Dendrocincla castanoptera^* is 

 regrettably a synonym of D. merula, for the type and one other speci- 

 men now in the U. S. National Museum do not differ in any essential 

 respect from two examples m the collection of the American Museum 

 of Natural History, taken by S. M. Klages at Suapure, Venezuela, nor 

 from the Lafresnaye specimen above mentioned. The two examples 

 of castanoptera are considerably smaller than the Lafresnaye specimen 

 of merula with which Mr. Ridgway compared them, but this is certainly 

 but a sexual distinction. This sexual difference may easily be appre- 

 ciated by reference to the following comparative measurements:

 surface of wing-quills much more olivaceous than the tail, instead of 

 being of the same color. From D. merula it differs in having the

notseuni more olivaceous; wing-quills much washed with olivaceous; 

 upper wing-coverts olive-brown in place of mostly chestnut; sides of 

 head more ashy; throat less whitish; lower surface paler, rather more 

 rufescent, and a slight ochraceous postocular stripe. It is very dis- 

 tinct from Dendrocincla atrirostris by reason of its decidedly darker, 

 more olivaceous upper parts ; olivaceous tinged wing-quills ; more 

 deeply colored, rather more olivaceous ventral surface; almost obso- 

 lete ochraceous postocular stripe; and lack of pale shaft streaks on 

 the pileum. 



Mr. Ridgway'" was the first after Lawrence to recognize this species as 

 distinct from D. atrirostris, although it is much more closely allied to 

 D. fuliginosa and D. merula than to D. atrirostris. The specimens 

 from Guayaquil, Ecuador, placed under this form by Mr. Ridgway.^^ 

 belong, however, under D. olivacea lafresnayei, since true olivacea 

 must be restricted to Central America. Birds from Panama are in- 

 termediate between olivacea and lafresnayei, but nearer the former. 

 Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei (Ridgway).

 p. 138 (Santa Marta, Colombia). 



Type Locality. — Upper Amazon River. 



Geographical Distribution. — Ecuador and Colombia. 



Like Dendrocincla olivacea olivacea in size ; but in color lighter, more 

 rufescent above and below, the lining of wdng paler. From D. atri- 

 rostris it may be distinguished principally by lack of pale shaft streaks 

 on the pileum; obsolescent or absent ochraceous postocular stripe; 

 more olivaceous upper surface; and conspicuously more olivaceous 

 wings. 



As may thus easily be seen, lafresnayei is far more nearly related to 

 D. olivacea, D. fuliginosa, and even D. meruloides than to D. atrirostris, 

 although nearly all writers excepting Mr. Ridgway have, at least in part, 

 confused lafresnayei with atrirostris; and all records of atrirostris or 

 olivacea from Ecuador or Colombia refer undoubtedly to the present 

 form. Examples from Ecuador seem to agree with the type, and those 

 from Colombia are not separable from either. A series of some eleven 

 specimens from the Santa Marta region, Colombia, including the type 

 and original suite of Mr. Bangs' D. olivacea anguina,^'' exhibits a

considerable amount of individual variation [in the depth and shade 

 of color, both on the upper and lower surfaces, which differences com- 

 prise all that appear to distinguish anguina from lafresnayei: in conse- 

 quence of which anguina must be considered a s\aionym, as has 

 already been indicated b}^ Dr. Allen. ^^ 



The specimen in the Lafresnaye collection labelled as one of the types 

 of D. ntrirostris, and referred bj^ Mr. Ridgway to D. olivacea,^^ is un- 

 doubtedly an example of lafresnayei. Specimens of oHvacea from 

 Panama, clearly intermediate between olivacea and lafresnayei, point 

 conclusively to the necessit}' of using a trinomial for the latter. 



Dendrocincla olivacea phaeochroa (Berlepsch and Hartert).

f Type Locality. — Munduapo. Orinoco river, Venezuela. 



Geographical Distribution. — Venezuela. 



Ver}' close to Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei, and in size and gen- 

 eral color both above and below not distinguishable; but it has the 

 chin and cheeks less grayish, as well as the chestnut of the wing-quills 

 less washed vath. olivaceous. It differs more decidedly from true 

 olivacea, however, in its lighter, more rufescent coloration, more ochra- 

 ceous chin, and less olivaceous -R-ing-quills. From D. merula, although 

 of the same size, it may be readily distinguished by its paler, rather 

 more olivaceous upper parts; much lighter, more rufescent or ochra- 

 ceous ventral surface, the throat buffy or ochraceous instead of whitish 

 or grayish; lighter lores; and a slightly evident ochraceous postocular 

 stripe. 



Three specimens in the collection of the American Museum of Natural 

 History, collected by S. M. Klages in Venezuela — two from Suapure, 

 one from La Union, Caura — agree perfectly with Messrs. Berlepsch and 

 Hartert's original description of phceochroa. These have been carefully 

 compared with the type of lafresnayei as well as with the considerable 

 series of that form at present available, -^-ith the result of demonstrating 

 that phceochroa is at best but a subspecies of olivacea, since the only 

 characters discernible to separate it from lafresnayei are shown to be 

 not entirely constant; yet it still is probably quite entitled to stand as 

 a geographical race on its merits as above said.

This new species appears to be undoubtedlj- most closely allied to 

 Dendrocincla olivacea lafresnayei. ■ From D. olivacea olivacea, whose 

 territory it inhabits, it differs in much the same respects as from lafres- 

 nayei, but more strongly. The type and sole specimen has been for 

 some years in the U. S. National Museum collection, and has been 

 successively identified as D. merula, D. olivacea and D. atrirostris! It 

 seems to be undoubtedly a distinct and hitherto undescribed species, 

 for its peculiarities are not such as appear readily or satisfactorily 

 explainable on grounds of individual variation. It bears its present 

 name in honor of Mr. Robert Ridgway, as a slight token of the author's 

 appreciative esteem.

lection, has been compared with specimens from British Guiana and 

 fomid to be identical, from which the assumption is apparently safe 

 that it hailed originally from that region, particularly as the birds from 

 Venezuela prove to be different. It is evidently an adult female, and 

 measures as follows: Wing, 95; tail, 73; exposed culmen,20.5; tarsus^ 

 24.5; middle toe, 14.5. All the specimens of true meruloides exam- 

 ined are females, and agree in size with those of the same sex of D. 

 meruloides aphanta. The measurements of meruloides given by Mr. 

 Ridgway-^ are also based on female examples, and are therefore too 

 small. The name Dendrocincla merulina of Cabanis and Heine^^ is a 

 mere puristic emendation of D. meruloides, and must therefore be 

 considered identical in application. 



Dendrocincla meruloides aphanta, subsp. nov.

The measurements of five adult males are as below : 



This new race differs from D. olivacea lafresnayei in its decidedly 

 more rufescent coloration both above and below; less ashy chin and 

 cheeks, the former more uniform with the breast; and less olivaceous 

 upper surface of the wings. It is much more rufescent throughout than 

 D. olivacea phcEOchroa, with the chin not conspicuously different from 

 the rest of the lower parts. 



Specimens from Venezuela are apparently like the type; but a con- 

 siderable series from Trinidad exliibits some individual color variations, 

 while as a whole it is intermediate between ophaiita &nd mendoides , 

 though decidedly nearer the former.

Resembles D. meridoides mendoides, but is much darker throughout, 

 particularly on the abdomen; the chin, however, is lighter, and de- 

 cidedly contrasted with the breast; sides of head more rufescent; the 

 pileum still more so, and conspicuously different from the distinctly 

 olivaceous back. 



A very satisfactory series of eleven specimens of D. ruficeps, while it 

 evidences considerable individual difference in color, yet appears to 

 establish beyond reasonable doubt the validity of the species; for none 

 of these examples are so reddish on the back, rump, and lower surface 

 as either homochroa or acedesta. When Mr. Ridgway wrote-' he had 

 no specimens of real ruficeps, and all the birds referred by him to this 

 form, and upon which he predicated its subspecific relationship with

POST-GLACIAL NEARCTIC CENTKES OF DISPERSAL FOR REPTILES. 



BY ARTHUR ERWIX BROWN. 



If lasting values are to be reached in the study of geographical dis- 

 tribution, its conclusions must accord 'U'ith all else that is know^l of 

 the dynamics of evolution. Or, stated -^-ith more exact reference to 

 its especial problems, the areas marked off by it must correspond to 

 the distributional relations of genetically connected species and, at 

 the least, must not be at fault vnth. possible lines of dispersal from 

 centres of development by which they may have come to occupy their 

 present range. What is proposed here is an attempt to determine such 

 centres for Reptilia in North America. 



The scarcity of Tertiar}^ remains of- reptiles belonging to existing 

 groups confines the student of geographical distribution in the main 

 to post-glacial conditions, -udth little more knowledge of those pre- 

 ceding than the practical certainty that genera now widely ranging 

 are of great antiquity and were like-^ise wide rangmg in earlier periods, 

 and that a former north Atlantic land connection between Europe 

 and America must have coincided with a climate of sufficient warmth 

 to serve for the passage of reptiles belonging to genera now common 

 to both. 



In other ways the problem is simphfied by the absence in later periods 

 of a circumpolar reptilian faima, a consequence of which is that the 

 chief zoological bond of connection between the eastern and western 

 continents is wanting, and for reptiles a "Holarctic" region or an 

 ^'Arctogaean" realm can not be said to exist, the families and genera 

 common to more southern portions of both being insufficient to 

 link them. For this reason Mr. Sclater's term "Nearctic" is used 

 here. It should be said, however, that if for purposes of convenience or 

 uniformity it be desired to retain these later and broader generahza- 

 tions, no harm is likely to ensue if it be remembered that they do not 

 express the exact facts of present reptilian distribution, whatever they 

 may have been during the Tertiary. 



A further simpUfication results in northern regions from this same 

 absence of boreal reptiles, for it eliminates the meeting ground of a 

 northern with a southern migration, which constitutes the ''Transition" 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 465 



zone of various authors in other groups. If a transition zone existed 

 in the Ne arctic for reptiles it would follow meridians of longitude west 

 of the Mississippi river, instead of extending from cast to west. 



I have stated elsewhere^ that the present distribution of Nearctic 

 reptiles points to the two post-glacial centres indicated by Prof. C. C. 

 Adams,^ one in the southeastern Austroriparian, the other southwest- 

 ern, in the Sonoran. Some space must now be given to the evidence. 



In the same paper it was shown that in the southern Nearctic the 

 eastern and western reptilian faunas are so distinct that the communitj^ 

 between them is limited to a few species belonging to widely ranging 

 genera, and that the zone of change between them lies approximately 

 between the 96° and 98° meridians of longitude in Texas. In a 

 general way this zone may be carried north along those meridians, to 

 mark the separation between the whole Atlantic and the whole Sonoran 

 faunas, widening, however, toward the north in following up the rivers 

 of the Mississippi drainage. 



The division is in some measvu'e obscured by the presence in the 

 lowlands of the Mississippi and its tributaries of a few species, chiefly 

 serpents, originally derived from both faunas and occupying the 

 contiguous portions of their respective areas. 



The proposition that original post-glacial centres must have lain 

 far to the south, is more logically necessary in the case of reptiles than 

 T\-ith other vertebrates, and follows from their dependence as a class 

 upon warmth. If further evidence were needed, it would be found in 

 their great numerical superiority, both in species and individuals, in the 

 south. The whole extent of North America reaching from the border 

 of the great plains eastward to the Atlantic coast, and from the Gulf 

 of Mexico to the northern limit of reptiles, which, following Agassiz, 

 will here be known as the Atlantic subregion, to avoid confusion 

 with its Eastern district, contains 113 species and recognizable sub- 

 species in all orders of reptiles. Of these 56 are confined to some por- 

 tion of the Austroriparian district, and 15 are exclusively Eastern, 

 with 42 common to both, practically all of which are southern intru- 

 sions to varying distances into the Eastern. In the western Nearctic 

 the distribution of species is vastly more complex as to its details, 

 on account of the great variety of surrounding conditions in contiguous 

 areas produced b}^ rapid changes in altitude, and is not yet fully knoA\n, 

 but the excess of southern species is even greater, for assuming that 

 Dr. Merriam's division of the country from the western border of the

Atlantic" subregion to the Pacific coast into a Lower and an Upper 

 Sonoran accords best "^ith present knowledge, the Lower Sonoran 

 seems to have about 74 peculiar species, and the Upper Sonoran plus 

 his Transition has but about 13, with 35 common to both, of which 

 19 may be regarded as Lower Sonoran and only 6 as Upper. The 

 remainder belong to the Atlantic fauna. It should be explained that 

 these estimates are based upon a somewhat conser^-ative view as to 

 species, but if the method of minute analysis characteristic of the pres- 

 ent time be followed, the predominance of Lower Sonoran forms will be 

 even greater. 



Both from the logical necessity of the case and from the application 

 of one of the main criteria in common use, it seems clear that the areas 

 which at the retreat of the ice contained the elements from which our 

 present reptilian fauna has developed, must be sought for in the south. 



The briefest examination of the character and the abounding rich- 

 ness of the reptiles inhabiting the dry plateau extending from Texas 

 to Arizona and south into IMexico, as well as the phj-sical geography 

 of the whole Sonoran subregion, are enough to show that the dispersal 

 centre of that faura was here, in Cope's Chihuahuan. 



The Austroriparian is less clear \\-ithout close examination of evi- 

 dence. Two localities in this subregion excel all others in variety of 

 species, one in the extreme southeast toward Georgia and Florida, cor- 

 responding to the fauna termed by Cope Ocmvlgian; the other, or 

 Louisianan, on the lower Mississippi. Fifty-one species are common to 

 both, and in addition the Ocmulgian, including Cope's Florid an ^ 

 presents 21 not extending into the Louisianan, which in turn has 14, 

 one half of them, however, only entering its western border from the 

 Sonoran. Of the two the Ocmulgian shows a decidedly greater diver- 

 sity in species. 



A study in some detail of the genera points in the same direction. 

 Little argument is required to demonstrate the proposition that genera 

 now common to the Nearctic and the western Palsearctic must have 

 had that range established at a time when a Tertiarj^ north Atlantic 

 land connection coincided with a warm climate in the north, for the 

 absence from all bej^ond the northern border of the Neotropical of 

 such vigorous Nearctic genera as Colvher, Zamenis, Tropidonotvs, 

 Eutania, OpMhoIvs and others, which are identical T\ith or nearly re- 

 lated to Holarctic genera, renders it impossible that such community 

 in northern regions coTild have come about by means of the Antarctic 

 continent whose former existence is now urged by many palaeontolo- 

 gists, however well this would ser^-e to explain such anomalies as the

presence of pleurodire turtles in South America, and of two genera of 

 Neotropical Boidae in Madagascar. It has been shown by Heer, in 

 his researches upon Arctic fossil plants, that in the process of secular 

 cooling the mean temperature of northern Greenland, as late as the 

 early jVIiocene, was not far removed from that of central Virginia at 

 the present time — quite warm enough for the needs of such hardy stocks 

 as the genera above named — and the differentiation of reptiles of 

 modern types had progressed so far by the close of the ]\Iesozoic, that 

 not much risk is incurred in believing that many existing genera were 

 in existence long before the end of the Eocene. Assuming a north 

 Atlantic highroad to have been the means of communication, the 

 longest Nearctic establishment of these common forms is likely to 

 have been in the older geological regions far in the east. It is further 

 true that with many of them traces of their primitive representatives 

 appear to be found in existing species of the eastern part of the Austro- 

 riparian. 



Omitting mere Neotropical intrusions into the southern border of 

 the Nearctic, such as Alligator, Crocodilus, Anolis, Sphcerodactylus, 

 Helicops, Spilotcs, Rhadinea, Drymobius, Tantilla, Erythrolamprus 

 and Elaps, as well as Trionyx, Chelydra, Emys and Testudo, each of 

 which had a wide Tertiary extension in northern regions, but whose 

 recent distribution throws no fiuther light on the present question, 

 most of the remaining genera may be referred for their origin to the 

 Austroriparian or Lower Sonoran faunas.

In searching for the localities which may be conceived to have 

 been those of the Nearctic origin of genera, it is to be observed that 

 little is to be learned from Chelon'a, for the aquatic habits of most of 

 the order renders them relatively untrustworthy as guides in terrestrial 

 distribution and, furthermore, we are as yet ignorant of the characters 

 in most genera which should be regarded as primitive. Nevertheless, 

 it is obvious that conditions best favoring the development of fresh- 

 water turtles must have always been far more completely presented 

 in the well watered Atlantic subregion than in the arid Sonoran. 



In Cinosternidse the extensive range of the Atlantic species, Cino- 

 sternum pennsylvanicum and Aromochelys odoratus, favors the view 

 that they have been longest established, and it would appear further 

 that the Louisianan and Sonoran species do not exhibit any great 

 amount of differentiation from these forms. 



Of the thirteen species of Chrysemys found in the whole Nearctic, 

 ten are restricted to the Atlantic subregion. Eight of these are Austro- 

 riparian, three of them entering the Eastern. The near relationship 

 between C. concinna, C. mohilensis, C. scabra and C. ruhriventris. all 

 especially numerous on the southeastern coast, points to their long 

 presence there. 



In the Nearctic, Emys and Clemmys are confined to the Eastern, 

 wdth the exception of one species of Clemmys on the Pacific coast, 

 but each has a representative in the Palsearctic, and Emys is known 

 from the Eocene of both continents. No reason can be assigned for 

 their present limited Nearctic range, which must be looked upon as 

 one of the anomalies of survival of ancient forms. 



The box tortoises of the genvis Terrapene range everywhere east of

the Rocky mountains, but if the view of Dr. Baur be accepted, that the 

 gradual disappearance of the quadrato-jugal is a progressive character, 

 T. major of the southern Austroriparian and T. hauri of Florida are 

 the most primitive. 



A distinctly negative character of the whole Atlantic subregion 

 is its poverty in lizards, their almost complete absence being, in fact, 

 the correlative of an abundance of water turtles. Its lizards are So- 

 noran, \\'ith the exception of Ophisaurus, restricted to the Austro- 

 riparian, whose close relationship to the Palsearctic Pseudopus justifies 

 placing its original centre along the Atlantic coast, and Rhincura, now 

 only found in Florida, but perhaps known from the Oligocene of Da- 

 kota. Liolepisma later ale, which occupies only the Austroriparian 

 and the southeastern corner of the Eastern as far as New Jersey, 

 belongs to a genus of wide extension in the Australian, Ethiopian and 

 Oriental regions, but having no other representative in the Holarctic 

 except one in China, whose specific characters are identical mth it."^ 

 This instance conforms to the imknown law which has preserved 

 on the eastern shores of Asia and North America so manj- alUed rem- 

 nants of ancient groups among both animals and plants. 



]\Iore exact evidence is afforded by Ophidia, for with two exceptions 

 it is believed that the genera now widely spread in the Nearctic can 

 be sho-^-n to have probably originated in the eastern centre. Of those 

 more locallj^ restricted, wliich must in most cases be descendants of 

 these earlier forms, a difficulty must be admitted in the comparative 

 absence of structiu-al clues to relationship, especially in Colubridse. 

 The relative position assigned to genera by Mr. Boulenger, however, 

 merits a high degree of confidence- and has been much relied upon. 

 It may be added that there are quite enough cases where high proba- 

 bility can be assured, to warrant propositions with which the uncertain 

 ones at least fail to conflict. 



The genus Tropidonotus, cosmopolitan as to the greater life areas 

 except that it enters only the northern border of the Neotropical, in 

 the Nearctic is absent from the Pacific coast, and in fact enters the 

 Sonoran only by its river bottoms, from which the assumption is 

 justified that it originally entered North America from western 

 Europe. The common species of the whole Atlantic subregion, 

 Tropidonotus sipedon, seems quite surely to have been near the parent 

 form, though it is less clear which of the two subspecies, T. s. sipedon 

 or T. s. fasciatus, should be regarded. The young of both, as a rule.

470 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April. 



have the color pattern of the adults, but more or less cross-banding 

 with narrow interspaces frequently replaces the spots on the forepart 

 of the body in young and some adult T. s. sipedon, resembling those 

 which form the normal pattern on the whole length in eastern examples 

 of T. s. fasciatus—a fact which perhaps signifies the partial retention of 

 an ancestral pattern, now completely lost in the third subspecies, T. s. 

 transversus of the Louisianan fauna. It is probable that T. s. fasciatus 

 of the southeast represents the earliest form. Within the bounds of 

 the Ocmulgian, T. cydopeum and T. taxispilotus have developed 

 from T. sipedon, while farther west, in the Mississippi valley, the way 

 to T. rhomUfer was through T. s. transversus. The whole of the ill- 

 defined series grouped about T. compressicaudus and T. ustus is Flori- 

 dan and shows the wealth of differentiation, still unstable as to fixity 

 of character, which has resulted in the Ocmulgian under conditions 

 highly favorable to the genus. There seems no clue to the direct ori- 

 gin of the group of species represented by T. leheris and its allies, with 

 seventeen or nineteen rows of scales and longitudinal stripes, but it is 

 worth noting that a similar distribution of color occurs in a number of 

 eastern Palsearctic and Oriental Tropidonotus. 



Separated structurally from the foregoing genus only by its entire 

 anal plate is Eutcenia, which covers the whole Nearctic to the northern 

 limit of snakes, and perhaps equals in number of individuals all other 

 species combined. From its cosmopolitan extension Tropidonotus 

 must be the parent. It is suggestive that the eastern form of the com- 

 mon garter snake, known as E. sirtalis ordinatus, with dark spots on 

 a greenish ground and no stripes, much resembles some color phases 

 of Tropidonotus natrix of Europe, and has like it nineteen rows of 

 scales and seven upper labials. The yellow collar of T. natrix is not 

 known in any race of E. sirtalis, but it possibly reappears in the pale 

 postoral crescents of some Sonoran species, as E. marciana and E. 

 hammondi. 



E. s. ordinatus grades into E. s. sirtalis, whose western representative, 

 E. s. parietalis, on the Pacific coast runs into E. elegans through such 

 examples as those which Cope regarded as E. infernalis,* and in the 

 southwestern Sonoran into E. marciana, E. hammondi and E. eques. 

 The species of the great plains, E. radix, has commonly twenty-one 

 scale rows and seven upper labials, but often presents the scutellation 

 of E. sirtalis and probably is derived from it, an important change 

 being that the lateral stripe has moved up one row of scales. And it

is of interest here to note that certain garter snakes from Indiana, 

 about the eastern Hmit of E. radix, called by Cope E. butleri, show irreg- 

 ularities ill the position of the lateral stripe perhaps indicating transi- 

 tion. E. radix is a connecting link on the one hand with E. proxima 

 of the ]\Iississippi valley, which in the east has given off E. saurita 

 and E. sackeni, and on the other, in the southwest with E. megalops 

 and doubtles other Mexican forms. 



If this hypothetical family-tree of Eutcenia is correct, an interesting 

 lesson in lines of dispersal of Austroriparian genera may be gained 

 from their diagrammatic representation :

Of the remaining so-called Natrieinae, all of which are small and 

 more or less degenerate representatives of Tropidonotus and Eutcenia 

 or of the stock from which they came, the most widely spread genera, 

 Storeria, Haldea and Virginia are chiefly Atlantic, Seminatrix is 

 wholly Ocmulgian, Tropidoonium, of limited range and probably of 

 relatively late origin, belongs to the Mississippi valley, and the very 

 few specimens of Amphiardis known are from Dallas, Texas, on the 

 western borderland of the Austroriparian. 



Among other widely ranging genera, Zamenis is an ancient form 

 whose present distribution includes also the Palsearctic and Oriental 

 regions. The earliest Nearctic style seems likely to be represented -by 

 Z. flagellum flagellum, which belongs to the Ocmulgian centre. The 

 yoimg of this species show narrow cross-bands, and occasionally much 

 wider ones, as well as a tendency to form narrow stripes on the centres 

 of some of the lateral scale rows, all of these being present as diagnostic 

 characters in various combination in adults of most other American 

 species. The inequality of color between the anterior and posterior 

 portions of the body, characteristic of all, is most pronounced in 

 Z. f. flagellum. 




472 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April, 



Coluber has about the same range as Zamenis, but in the Nearctic 

 does not pass beyond the Rocky mountains. The distribution of 

 color most common in the genus consists of three rows of spots, but 

 in many species, especially in America, there is a disposition for these 

 to run together by their corners and form longitudinal stripes. This 

 is indicated more especially in some western and Central American 

 species, as C. subocularis and C. lineaticollis, and culminates in C. quad- 

 rivittatus, which is spotted when young and wholly striped when 

 mature. C. obsoletus confinis is in most respects generalized as to 

 pattern, and either this species, or less probably C. guttatus, both 

 chiefly Ocmulgian, are likely to be near the primitive form, 

 h In the Lower Sonoran Coluber has given off Arizona and Pityophis, 

 the last having sent one species, P. melanoleucus, the most specialized 

 of the genus in the shape of its rostral, and in disappearance of the 

 headjbands in adults, back into the Atlantic as far north as New Jersey. 



The genus Ophibolus, generally distributed in the Nearctic, except 

 in the northwest, is nearly related to Coronella of the western Palse- 

 arctic and Ethiopian. It does not seem possible to determine whether 

 the parent is represented by some color form of 0. getulus or 0. doliatus, 

 but the coronelline affinity indicates with sufficient certainty that Ophi- 

 bolus must have come from a source whose Palsearctic connections 

 were by way of the eastern or north Atlantic route. It may be 

 significant that while no subspecific distinction is warranted, most 

 Florid an examples of 0. getulus getulus, which is the most vigorous and 

 extended species, seem to be rather generalized in the character of the 

 dorsal spots and bands, as between northern specimens of the same 

 form and the Louisianan 0. g. sayi. The further fact has a bearing, that 

 the specific characters of forms from the western part of the Nearctic 

 seem' to show less stability than the eastern ones, especially so in 0. g. 

 boylii and 0. g. californicB, thus pointing to a more recent development 

 of these subspecies. 



Liopeltis and Cyclophis are examples of the remarkable discontinuity 

 already noted in the range of certain other genera common to eastern 

 Asia^and eastern North America. In the last Liopeltis covers the 

 whole Atlantic subregion, while Cyclophis is mainly Austroriparian . 

 Both extend to no great distance into the Sonoran. 



The case for Heterodon is not free from doubt. The form of its 

 rostral seems to suggest that it belongs among the types which have 

 been so freely developed in the dry Lower Sonoran, and its possible 

 relationship to the South American Lystrophis would accord with this 

 assignment, but on the other hand, the largest and most widely spread 




1904.] NATURA.L SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 473 



species, H. platyrhinos, is found upon suitable soils over most of the 

 Atlantic subregion and is especially common on the coast from New 

 Jersey to Florida; H. simus is Austroriparian and chiefly Ocmulgian; 

 while the smallest and most feeble species only, H. nasicus, is Sonoran 

 and does not extend west of the Rocky mountains. There is good 

 reason, therefore, to refer Heterodon to the Austroriparian, in which 

 case its Neotropical affinity renders it probable that Florida was the 

 region of its origin. 



Among CrotalidiP, Ancistrodon only can be referred to the Atlantic 

 subregion, A. contortrix being spread over its whole extent and .4. 

 pisdvorus confined to the Austroriparian, where numerically it is in 

 excess in the extreme southeast. Both species enter the borders 

 of the Sonoran at suitable localities. The assignment of the genus 

 to the Atlantic coast is further justified by its occurrence in eastern 

 Asia. 



Of these more or less cosmopolitan, or Holarctic genera, which niust 

 be supposed to have occupied the Nearctic during the Tertiary, and 

 even of related groups restricted to the Nearctic but of sufficient 

 extension there to warrant belief in their relatively considerable age, 

 it is seen that there is reason to believe that all but Sceloporus, Cnemi- 

 dophorus, Eumeces, Sistrurus and Crotalus belonged to the Atlantic 

 post-glacial centre, which from the present numerical proportion of 

 species and individuals, as well as the geological age of the region; 

 seems to have been the Ocmulgian. 



From this centre a route to the north has been freely open along the 

 low coast plain east of the Alleghenies, to distances into the Eastern 

 district determined for each migrant by limitmg conditions, of which, 

 in this case, temperature must be regarded as the most important. 

 A few powerful species, such as Coluber obsoletus obsoletus, Ophibolus 

 doliatus triangulus and to a less extent Pityophis melanoleucus, have 

 chosen this route to the region north of the Ohio river, turning west- 

 ward about the Potomac or Susquehanna. 



The other main highway was westward along the Gulf coast to the 

 Mississippi river and up that valley, where conditions are highly 

 favorable to reptilian life, spreading eastward at the north to southern 

 Indiana and Ohio. Few species traveled this route unaltered, for with 

 most of them the changed conditions encountered have resulted in 

 the establishing of variations, at least of color, with which a sound 

 taxonomy must reckon. An excellent example of this is Ophibolus 

 getulus getulus, which ranges from Florida north to the pine region of 

 New Jersey with no change which has yet been held to warrant a new 




474 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [April; 



trinominal, but on its western course, as it enters the Louisianan it be- 

 comes 0. g. sayi, and still further west, in the Texan, is even now per- 

 haps differentiating into a color form known as 0. g. splendidus. The 

 Louisianan subspecies has moved up the Mississippi valley as far as 

 southern Illinois, and even in that region an occasional specimen shows 

 the pattern of splendidus. The lower Mississippi valley may indeed, 

 with some reason, be regarded as a secondary and more modern centre 

 of development in Chelonia and Ophidia. 



Quite different from the condition of temperature which has limited 

 the northward extension of Ocmulgian forms, that wliich has checked or 

 transformed them on the western route is the lack of moisture encoim- 

 tered beyond the Mississippi, about the beginning of the great plains. 



Another northwestward route from the Ocmulgian may have been 

 directly through or aroimd the lower end of the Alleghenies by way of 

 ancient river valleys, but it is not probable that this was traveled as 

 freely as those leading by the coast plain in either direction. 



It may be repeated that the present study deals only with post- 

 glacial conditions. If, as has been assumed, the interchange of reptiles 

 between the Nearctic and the Palaearctic was by means of a north 

 Atlantic connection, their Tertiary centres of development were doubt- 

 less of greater area and much farther to the north.

A Spencer Objective. — Mr. F. J. Keeley described a microscope 

 objective of one-foiu-th inch focus, made in 1860 by Charles A. Spencer. 

 It was recently necessary to take apart the back system for re-balsam- 

 ing, when it was found to consist of five lenses, three of which were 

 convex and two concave. One of these proved, on examination with 

 polarized light, to be fluorite, which mineral, while isotropic, exhibits 

 characteristic optical anomalies between crossed prisms that permit 

 of its identification, at least in contradistinction from glass or other 

 material used for lenses. The fluorite lens is perfectly preserved, as 

 might be expected from the stable character of the mineral. When 

 objectives of more recent manufactm-e containing fluorite have deteri- 

 orated, the fluorite has been blamed for faults which should undoubtedly 

 have been attributed to unreliable glass used in connection wdth it. 



This objective is historically interesting as illustrating the complex 

 nature of the corrections adopted by Spencer at so early a date, as 

 well as confirming the previous reports that he had appreciated the 

 possibilities connected with the use of fluorite in securing superior 

 color corrections and employed it for the purpose twenty years before 

 it came into use abroad. 



The objective has an aperture of 142 to 152 degrees, according to 

 position of adjustment, which acts by rectilinear movement of back 

 systems, and is unusually well corrected for color. It resolves Pleuro- 

 sigma angvlatum sharply into dots with central light from mirror, 

 and with oblique illumination resolves markings 76,000 to the inch. 

 In some respects its performance was possibly slightly sacrificed in 

 elimmating color, for with a large central illuminating cone, its defi- 

 nition is somewhat inferior to that of objectives of similar power made 

 by Tolles at slightly earlier and later dates, which show considerably 

 more color. The latter, although both over forty years old, compare 

 favorably, optically and mechanically, with best achromatics made to- 

 day, and it seems not unlikely that Spencer abandoned the use of 

 fluorite because he realized that sharp definition was more important 

 than the elimination of last trace of color, rather than from any fear 

 of its lack of permanency.

OBSEEVATIONS ON HYEAX. 



BY HEXRY C. CHAPMAX, M.D. 



The structure of Hyrax has been so thoroughly mvestigated by Pal- 

 las/ Owen/ Brandt/ Mirie and ^livart/ and George/ as well as by other 

 anatomists, that little or nothing remains now to be said by any one 

 to whom the rare opportunity is afforded of dissecting this mteresting 

 animal. In exhibiting to the Academy the muscular system and viscera 

 of a fine male specimen of Hyrax {Procavia Brucei), most kindly put at 

 the disposition of the "UTiter by Messieiu-s Edmond, Perrier and Gervais, 

 of the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, attention was nevertheless called to 

 the fact that the figures illiLstrating the form of stomach as offered 

 by PaUas, Brandt and George give an imperfect, even an erroneous, 

 idea of that of the stomach of the Hyrax dissected by the wiiter. 

 Accordmg to the anatomists just referred to, the cardiac portion of 

 the stomach in Hyrax is large and 

 globular, the pyloric portion small and 

 narrow, whereas exactly the reverse 

 obtains in the stomach of the specimen 

 submitted to the "^mter (fig. 1). In- 

 asmuch as the narrow cardiac portion 

 of the stomach is extremely muscular 

 in Hyrax, it might be supposed that 

 such condition may have been due 

 to the fluid in which the speci- 

 men had been preserved. In the 

 Fig. 1. judgment of the -^Titer the marked 



difference in contour presented by the two regions of the stomach 

 cannot be so accounted for. In confirmation of the view that the 

 form of the stomach so found was normal and not due to post-mortem

contraction, it should be mentioned that when the animal was opened, 

 although the two parts of the stomach were distended with food, it 

 nevertheless presented two distinct cardiac and pyloric portions. At 

 the same time the small intestine was empty, which would not have 

 been the case had the stomach contracted to any extent upon its con- 

 tents. It is well known that in the six-banded armadillo {Dasypus 

 sexcinctus), in the two-toecl ant eater {Mynriecophaga didadyla) and in 

 the two-toed sloth (Choloepus Hofmanni) the coecum presents two coecal 

 processes, and in Hyrax, in addition to a coecum proper, the alimentary 

 canal is provided wdth a second dilatation, terminating also in two 

 coecal processes resembling somewhat those just referred to as occur- 

 ring in the edentates just mentioned. It will be observed, however, 

 that the two coecal processes found in Hyrax, but in no other mam- 

 mal, so far as is known to the writer, are appendages of the colon and 

 not of the coecum proper. The significance of these colonic append- 

 ages is not known. 



The length of the alimentar}- canal in Hyrax is as follows accord- 

 ing to 



Owen George Chapman 



Small intestine, 54 64 38 inches. 



Coecum, 3 4 4 " 



Colonic coecum, 3^ 6 " 



Large intestine, 58 52 35 " 



112 120 77" 



The length of the alimentary canal was nearly five times that of the 

 animal, measured from snout to anus, a ratio not differing essentially 

 from that of Owen^ and George.^ 



The villi of the small intestine of Hyrax, as is well known, are re- 

 markably well developed, indeed as long proportionally as in the 

 rhinoceros. ** The attention of anatomists does not appear, however, 

 to have been directed to the fact that some of the villi are longer than 

 others, the former terminating in branched or club-like processes 

 (fig. 2), resembling somewhat the villi of the Indian rhinoceros 

 studied by the writer. In view of the difference of opinion that 

 has prevailed among systcmatists as to the affinities of Hyrax 

 with the remaining mammalia, this fact might be urged as con-

firming the view held by Cuvier^" and Owen/^ that Hyrax is nearly 

 related to the rhinoceros, as shown by its rhinoceros-like incisor and 

 molar teeth, the incisor teeth being developed as in 

 the extinct Rhinoceros incisivus, the molar teeth 

 presenting essentially the same pattern in both ani- 

 mals; the position of the oesophagus in regard to the 

 stomach, the relatively simple stomach and complex 

 coecum, the perissodactyle number of ribs 22, the 

 hoofs of the unsymmetrical tetradactyle fore-foot 

 and tridactyle hindfoot as in Aceratherium, an ex- 

 tinct hornless rhinoceros, etc. On the other hand, as 

 Fig. 2. first shown by Home,'^ the placenta in Hyrax is 



zonular, like that of the elephant and carnivora — a fact somewhat 

 inconsistent with the view that would regard Hyrax as a little 

 rhinoceros. Still, it miLst be admitted, since it has been showTi by 

 the writer^^ that the same kind of mammals (Edentata) may have 

 different form of placenta and different kinds of mammals the 

 same form, that the form of the placenta is of little or no value in 

 the classification of the mammalia. In the absence of fossil re- 

 mains of Hyrax, though the extinct Hyracotherium may be some- 

 what allied, it is impossible to assign Hyrax to any living form of 

 mammals. For the present, therefore, it may be regarded as sui 

 generis the representative of an extinct order Hyracoidca, of which 

 Dendrohyrax is also a member. As a matter of record, it may be 

 stated that fragments of a species of tapeworm (Moniezia) were found 

 in the small intestine, and also a number of specimens of Ascaris ferox, 

 as identified by my colleague, Prof. Percy Moore. In regard to the 

 urogenital apparatus, its disposition was found to be essentially the 

 same as described by Pallas, George, etc. In the specimen of 

 Hyrax dLssected by the writer, the testicles were found lying in the 

 abdominal ca^dty below the kidneys, and were longer rather than 

 shorter than the latter, as hitherto described. The ureters opened 

 into the fundas of the bladder, the aperture of the left one being situ- 

 ated a trifle lower than that of the right one. The vasa deferentio, 

 as they pass behind the bladder, become so much convoluted as to 

 resemble a second epididymis, terminating finally in two openings 

 situated in the under part of the veru montamim of the urethra. 

 The lower convoluted portions of the vasa deferentia, just referred to,

are regarded by George" as performing the functions of seminal vesicles. 

 Owen, however, states^^ having found true seminal vesicles quite dis- 

 tinct from the convoluted portions of the vasa dejerentia just men- 

 tioned. Fui'ther, there are two additional pairs of glands, the ducts of 

 the first opening into the upper portion of the veru montanum, those 

 of the second into the bulb of the urethra, and regarded respectively 

 by George^** as prostate and Couper's glands. The prostate glands were 

 considered by both Pallas" and Cuvier** to be the seminal vesicles, 

 but as the ducts of the latter terminate by openings quite distinct 

 from those of the vasa dejerentia, their nature as interpreted by George 

 is probably the correct one. The levatores muscles of the penis arise 

 from the symphysis pubis, and terminate in a single tendon, as was 

 the case in the rhinoceros dissected by the wi'iter, a disposition first 

 noticed by Owen.^^ The erectores and acceleratores muscles were 

 well developed. 



The Hyrax is regarded by naturalists and Biblical scholars as being 

 the animal referred to in the Bible as the " coney" — the |D£^* (saphan) of 

 the Hebrews and the /otpoypuXXio^ of the Greeks. The Hebrews were 

 forbidden by their law to make use of the coney as an article of food, it 

 being considered by them to be unclean, "because he cheweththe cud, 

 but di\'ideth not the hoof" (Lev. xi. 5). Biblical scholars, in their 

 efforts to determine what kind of an animal the coney of the Bible 

 really was, do not appear, however, so far as known to the writer, to 

 have noticed that, according to readings of Tischendorff and 

 Van Ess, Vetus Test Greece (Leviticus xi. 5), the coney does not 



chew the cud, '' xat zoy •/(npoyfioU.io'j^ ore ouk avayst /j.rjpuy.c<T;jiir/" • 



whereas, according to Deuteronomy xiv. 7, it does chew the cud, 



'* xat zaoTfi (lu ipaytnOt a~<i rwv w^ay<i\>r(u.' pTjpuy.ifrp.irj'^ There is no 



such discrepancy of 'reading, however, between the corresponding 

 texts in the Hebrew, the Vatican Codex^" and Sweet's Septuagint, 

 the Latin and English versions of the Bible, it being stated in all

^^ It is a curious fact that notwithstanding the Tischendorff Septuagint is 

 supposed to be an exact copy of the Vatican Codex, the ovic that occurs in tlie 

 former (Lev. xi. 5) is absent in the latter, and that no reason is given for the 

 variant reading. The writer takes the opportunity of expressing his thanks to 

 Prof. W. C. Lamberton, the distinguished Greek scholar, for giving him the 

 opportunity of consulting the different Greek versions of the Old Testament 

 referred to in the text. 




480 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



the versions that the coney cheweth the cud. As a matter of fact the 

 Hyrax does not chew the cud, even though the movements of its jaws 

 during feeding would suggest such action. Its stomach, though 

 divided into two distinct regions, is not adapted for rumination, and 

 the animal has never been observed to perform that act either in the 

 wild state or in captivity. It is possible, therefore, that the Hyrax of 

 Syria, after all, is not the animal referred to in the Bible as the coney, 

 even though the rocks were a refuge for the latter, according to the 

 Psalmist (civ. 18), as they still are for the Hyrax, and that the coneys, 

 like the Hyrax, are a "feeble folk, yet make their houses in the rocks" 

 (Prov. XXX. 26). On the other hand, if the Hyrax is still to be regarded 

 as the coney, as the Arabs think, then the Biblical texts in which it is 

 stated that the coney cheweth the cud should be re^^sed to make 

 them consistent with what is known to be the habit of Hyrax in 

 this respect.

Summer Activity of Some Spring Flowers. — Dr. Ida Keller re- 

 marked that the suddenness with which the first warm days of sprmg 

 call into being the so-called "sprmg flowers" is a yearly repeated 

 surprise, and although the following sunmier months are characterized 

 by conditions far more conducive to vegetative activity, we are accus- 

 tomed to find the plants which were conspicuous in April, May and 

 Jime sinking gradually into insignificance. Their time of active ser- 

 vice seems, therefore, to be confined within narrow limits. 



The slightest acquaintance with the laws governing plant physiology 

 leads to the conclusion that the complex structures thus quickly appear- 

 ing are in reality the result of the usual slow and elaborate processes 

 of the various phases of metabolism, and indeed close observation 

 shows that at least some of our well-kno^Ti species are busily at work 

 during the entire summer, preparing with great care and circumspec- 

 tion for the sensational outburst of the vernal season. 



No better illustration of this point could be found than the May- 

 apple. It is interesting to dig in the soil about these plants in July or 

 early August. Close to the surface the trowel is impeded by a network 

 of tough stems. Instead of growing upward, these formidable struc- 

 tures run parallel to the siu-face, or they rr.n diagonally downward, 

 or perhaps they may even point vertically downward, in defiance to 

 the laws of geotropism. The stems are anchored in the ground by 

 rather stout roots which come off at various points, and each stem is 

 terminated by a large bud. Lateral buds are also to be found. At 

 this time of the year the overground portion is in a process of slow de- 

 composition. The decaying leaf-stalk gives no evidence of this under- 

 ground activity, as a result of which we have great patches of Podo- 

 phyllum early the following year. 



While making these observations she had also noticed the False 

 Solomon's Seal. The flowering plants of the season had produced 

 fruit, but there were also many younger plants which had not yet 

 reached the flowering stage. On none of the plants wore long under- 

 ground stems visible, but their rhizomes were all well supplied with 

 31 




482 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



conspicuous buds. It was worthy of notice that the plants which 

 were too immature to produce flower and seed readily form several 

 underground buds, indicating that the latter method of reproduction 

 takes place at an earlier stage than that of seed formation. Owing to 

 this wise arrangement the danger of extermination from the ravages of 

 enthusiastic collectors is much reduced, since the plants thus reproduce 

 freely at this early stage of their existence without offering any temp- 

 tation to the hunters of ^\ild flowers, who abound in the woods at this 

 time of year. 



By far the most interesting observations on this underground method 

 of reproduction were made on Ariscema triphyllum. 



On the 27th of July a locality was found on Crvun creek where the 

 plants were very plentiful and in the various stages of development. 

 At the time of year mentioned the fruit was formed, and while still 

 green in color it showed a tendency to turn red. Below was the 

 thick corm and the two leaves were showing symptoms of decay by 

 their yellowish tinge. In some cases the leaves had already dropped 

 off completely. In one case the corm was of the same shape as that 

 of the mature plant, namely, depressed globose, while in another the 

 form was markedly different, being decidedly elongated and at the free 

 end there was the appearance of a scar, indicating some previous 

 attachment. It was these longish corms which appeared to indicate 

 some hidden meaning and which led her to continue the observation 

 in regard to their origin and significance. 



Some years ago, in a short paper entitled Underground Runners, she 

 had called attention to peculiar gro^^-ths on Ariscema triphyllum as 

 found in April. At that time of year they were small knob-like pro- 

 jections on the corm, while in Jidy these formations were at least an 

 inch in length. There may be several of them on the same corm, nor 

 are they restricted to the mature plants. This species also repro- 

 duces freely before it reaches the flowering age and thus decreases the 

 chances of extermination. This may partially explain the persistence 

 of the plant in our woods in spite of the fact that it is one of the favor- 

 ites of the enthusiastic collectors before mentioned. 



She had found that these structures drop off very readily, and was 

 much impressed with this peculiarity. In fact, it seemed impossible 

 to keep a corm and its growth intact. On. close inspection it appeared 

 that there had been a separation between the main body of the corm 

 and the structm-e even before they were distui'bed. The attachment 

 was entirely superficial, being simply due to a layer of skin which loosely 

 covered and hid the point of separation. The body is somewhat 

 bean-shaped, the bulk being made up of nourishing material, while 

 the apex is occupied by the terminal bud and the scar at the base marks 

 the point where it was originally connected with the parent plant. 

 A space already indicated the separation. Although still loosely 

 •united by the skin above alluded to, each of the two structures is pre- 

 pared for an independent existence. 



On the 20th of September she again observed the patches with the 

 view of determining the sequel of the interesting story. By this time 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 483 



most of the plants had died down, the still remaining leaves were yel- 

 Icwish and in a state of decay. The red fruits were nmnerous, and it 

 did not seem as though the plants were in immediate danger of exter- 

 mination, even if their sole method of propagation were by seed. On 

 uprooting some, she had found that the growths had been completely 

 severed from the parent corms, and that, in fact, they seemed to be 

 mo\-ing away from them. It is a significant fact that we do not find 

 the Jack-in-the-pulpit growing close together in tufts, as would natur- 

 ally follow were these short underground growths to develop in con- 

 nection T\-ith the corms from which they spring. The result of the 

 spontaneous loosening leads naturally to a prevention of this condition. 

 Futiu-e observations must determine just how far the young corms 

 may travel from the spot where they had their origin. The elongated 

 form terminated by a point would offer but slight resistance to any 

 force which would tend to carry them away. Thus we find in this 

 plant a rather imusual form of reproductive bodies in these under- 

 ground sprouts and probably also an unusual method of dissemination. 

 A considerable amount of activity is manifested in the formation of 

 these bodies, but this by no means represents the entire summer work 

 of this typical spring flower, even aside from the fruit formation. On 

 ^emo^'ing the decaying stems from the plant, a large pinkish, whole- 

 some bud comes into ^'iew. Within the three heaw protecting sheaths 

 the Jack-in-the-pulpit is completely formed in miniature. The leaf 

 is immistakable in its form, standing bolt upright, even emphasizing 

 the peculiarity of the adult leaf. Close to it is the inflorescence \sdth a 

 fully formed spathe and the flowers \^•ithin are marked by well-defined 

 masses of cells. Thus all is in readiness for the first warm days of the 

 following spring. 



To some extent the same is true of Podophyllum. In the vigorous 

 buds terminating the underground stems, described above, the leaf 

 and flower are also plainly formed. It is also true of Smilacina 

 racemosa, though perhaps to a less degree. Here the future raceme 

 is foreshadowed by the characteristic shape of the vegetative point. 

 We may safely conclude, therefore, that the summer months are 

 also a busy season with these spring flowers. We can appreciate how 

 heavy the demands are on the vegetative activity of the leaves of 

 Ariscema triphijllum when we remember that one current must cany 

 nutrition to the forming fruit, at least in the seed-bearing plants, 

 another stream travelling in the opposite direction must provide for 

 the food supply of the miniature plant in the bud, and also for the for- 

 mation of the underground reproductive bodies above described. 

 The season is indeed one full of activity up to the time when its close 

 is marked by the fruit dropping heavily from the exhausted stalk.

NEW POLYCH^TA FROM CALIFORNIA. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Some Polychaeta gathered by Mr. E. C. Starks, at San Diego, Cali- 

 fornia, were recently sent to me for determination by Prof. Harold 

 Heath, of Leland Stanford, Jr., University. Besides the eight herein 

 described the collection includes about thirty species, most of which 

 have been recorded from the Pacific coast by Johnson. Baird, Fewkes 

 and others. A full list of these will be published in another connection. 



Diopatra californica n. s. (PL XXXVII, figs. 1 to 9.) 



This species probably attains a length of 200 mm., although the 

 only complete example measures only 110 mm. long and 5 mm. wide at 

 the termination of the region of long branchiae. Prostomium small, 

 mostly concealed by the bases of its appendages. Frontal tentacles 

 nearly in contact at their bases, fusiform, nearly equal to the pros- 

 tomium in length. Five principal tentacles similar in size, form and 

 structure, arising in close contact from an arcuate area nearly covering 

 the dorsum of the prostomium. The basal fourth of each forming a 

 conspicuous ceratophore divided into twelve to fourteen rings equalling 

 in length the head and frontal tentacles, the styles smooth, slender 

 and tapeiing, apparently subequal, but the tips imperfect. Eyes, a 

 pair of prominent, slightly pigmented swellings nearly in contact and 

 occupying most of the region of the head posterior to the tentacles. 

 Palps prominent, slightly bilobed processes bounding the mouth in 

 front and in contact mesially. 



Peristomium slightly shorter than the prostomium, which it em- 

 braces laterally. Nuchal tentacles on its extreme anterior margin, 

 and in line with the outer edge of the inner lateral tentacles. The 

 next two or three somites nearly equal the peristomium, and are 

 rounded at the margins, while the remaining ones are much shorter, 

 usually only about one-sixth or one-eighth of their width. For about 

 the first fifth of the body through the branchial region they are much 

 flattened, but beyond that become gradually rounded and taper toward 

 the tail, which is terminated by a bead-like pygidium bearing near the 

 middle line a pair of delicate ventral cirri having a length equal to the 

 last eight or nine somites. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 485 



The first distinct parapodium is on the somite following the peris- 

 tomium and consists of a setigerous body ^\'ith three cirri, a postsetal 

 lobe and a dorsal and ventral cirrus, all slender and conical and the latter 

 about twice as long as the others. The second and third parapodia are 

 similar, with the dorsal cirri longer. As far as the sixth or seventh the 

 dorsal cirri continue to increase in length, then gradually diminish 

 through the branchial region, and behind the latter remain small and 

 slender to the end. The ventral cirrus undergoes no change in the first 

 four parapodia, but suddenly disappears in the fifth, where it is repre- 

 sented by a small glandular prominence, which increases in size and in 

 the middle branchial region extends about one-fourth of the distance 

 across the venter. Beyond the branchial region it becomes smaller. 

 The postsetal lobe is likewise largest on the first four somites, and after 

 reduction in the first few branchial segments, accompanied by a rota- 

 tion ventrad, remains for the entire middle region of the body a blunt, 

 moderately sized lobe ventro-caudad of the setae tuft. In the posterior 

 half of the body all parts of the parapodia are reduced and finally 

 become mere low papillse. 



In the region of their greatest development the branchiae are large 

 and prominent, of a tall and slender form, much like a juniper tree, but 

 with the spirally disposed branches more open m arrangement and, 

 below them a distinctly annulated basal portion of the trunk. They 

 begin abruptly on the foiu-th parapodium, and the first is about 

 three-fifths as long as the largest on the sixth or seventh parapodium. 

 Beyond this point they gradually decrease in size, the number of 

 whorls of branches at the same time increasing, and their arrangement 

 becoming more open. By the twenty-seventh parapodium the spiral 

 arrangement has disappeared altogether and the stem is simply curved, 

 with the branches in a linear series on the convex side, an arrangement 

 which begins to appear at the tip of some of the preceding gills, as 

 though they were gradually unwinding. The number of turns in 

 different branchise of the type is 11 on the first, 13 on the second, 

 15 on the third and fourth, 13 on the sixth, 10 on the tenth, 7 on the fif- 

 teenth, 4 on the twentieth, and none on the twenty-fifth. Beyond 

 the thirtieth parapodium each gill consists merely of a stalk, usually 

 curved at the free end and bearing a terminal tuft of short branches, 

 with a few others in a series below. These gradually decrease in size, 

 and by the fortieth parapodium are nearly or quite simple, and finally 

 disappear by the sixtieth parapodium. 



On the first four parapodia the setae are of two kinds, guarded uncini 

 and simple slender seta». The former are nearly colorless and have 




486 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



an incomplete transverse fracture or joint near the outer end and a 

 strongly hooked tip with a stout subterminal spur ; the guard extends 

 somewhat beyond the terminal hook, and in the larger uncini at least 

 reaches far down the shaft, along which its margin is distinctly free 

 and denticulated. They are arranged in three groups, a ventral of 

 two small and slender uncini (PL XXXVII, fig. 2), a middle of one 

 large stout (PI. XXXVII, fig. 1) and three to five smaller ones, and a 

 dorsal group of one or two which are usually longer, especially in the 

 end piece, than any of the others and intermediate in thickness. 

 The more slender uncini, as shown in the ventral one figured, have the 

 guards more prolonged. Of the simpe setae (PL XXXVII, fig. 3) there 

 are but one or two in each foot, and they arise just dorsad of the pos- 

 terior row of uncini, the longest one reaching nearly or quite to the 

 tip of the posterior lobe and nearly equalling in diameter aU but the 

 very stoutest uncini. They are colorless, translucent, have barely 

 visible oblique striations, become increasingly curved toward the tip, 

 and when perfect are terminated by a small flexible filament. 



On the tenth and succeeding parapodia the character of the setae 

 is altogether changed. There are no uncini, but in their place a spread- 

 ing ventral vertical row of rather stout pale yellow strongly striated 

 setae, four to six in number, with the outer ends broadened, flattened 

 and rather strongly curved and tapered to a very acute point (PL 

 XXXVII, fig. 4). Dorsad of the postsetal lobe is a compact horizontal 

 row of more numerous, longer, narrower and straighter setse of other- 

 wise similar form and structure. At the base of these, on the dorsal 

 side, is a group of a few colorless spatulate setse with slender stems 

 and abruptly broadened fork-shaped ends with seven tines (PL 

 XXXVII, fig. 5). 



By the thirty-fifth parapodium the setae are practically all confined 

 to the horizontal dorsal fascicle and the spatulate setse are more 

 numerous, and have broader more curved plates wdth as many as nine 

 rather spreading tines. Among them are also a few very small spatu- 

 late setse with ovoid blade and simple mucronate tip. Posteriorly 

 the setae, especially the simple ones, are reduced in number, become 

 more slender and project far beyond the now ver}^ small ventro-caudal 

 lobe. By the seventy-fifth parapodium only about six such setae 

 remain, and the spatulate setse have continued to wdden and bear as 

 many as eleven times. Still further caudad the nmnber of setae is 

 further reduced and they become more slender. 



The four anterior parapodia are each supported by about three 

 slender aciculi which enter the base of the dorsal cirrus, and the same

number of stouter ones iii the setigerous lobe. A single hooked and 

 guarded acicnlus appears ventrally at about the tenth parapodium, 

 and by the twenty-fifth there are two very stout ones (PI. XXXVII, fig. 

 6), and above these a vertical row of four or five less stout but more 

 opaque and deeply colored aciculi, whose ends project freely as acute 

 points which increase in length dorsally where they pass into the regular 

 series of setse. Just beyond the point of their emergence is a slightly 

 swollen deep brown spot, at which they readily break, indicating the 

 existence of an imperfect joint (PL XXXVII, fig. 7). The arrangement 

 just described continues to the seventy-fifth somite at least, and prob- 

 ably considerabl}^ beyond, but the one hundred and twenty-fifth has 

 two hooked aciculi, only two pointed ones and a single simply bent and 

 unguarded one (PI. XXXVII, fig. 8). 



The jaws (PI. XXXVII, fig. 9) are nearly black and stout. The 

 maxillae have short, broad carriers, not united in the middle, and their 

 bases bear two prominent tubercles. The next dorsal plate bears six 

 or seven stout teeth, the next five on the left and seven on the right 

 side, T\ith a thin edentulous plate on each side. The extra plate on 

 the left side bears seven or eight teeth. The mandibles have the ter- 

 minal piece white and translucent, the carriers deep brown, loosely 

 joined, very broadly roimded at the base and with a prominent longi- 

 tudinal ridge. 



Eunice biannulata n. s. (PI. XXXVII, figs. 10-18; PI. XXXVIII, fig. 42.)] 



The type and largest example is 137 mm. long and 5.3 mm. between 

 the tips of the parapodia at the widest point. The prostomium is 

 short and broad, the length barely exceeding one-half the width, the 

 anterior border scarcely emarginated, but the anterior lobes or palpi 

 swelling broadly ventrad and laterad, and separated by a distinct 

 median ventral furrow passing backward to the mouth, while a faint 

 transverse groove separates a small anterior from a larger posterior 

 portion. The tentacles arise in a nearly straight transverse line 

 across the anterior portion of the white posterior half of the pros- 

 tomium; the paired tentacles are in contact at their bases and are 

 separated from the median tentacle by a distance about equalling the 

 diameter of the latter. Ceratophores all very low and broad; styles 

 constricted at the base, increasing gradually in diameter for one-fourth 

 or one-fifth of their length and then tapering regularly to the end, 

 simply articulated at the base, strongly beaded distally, the terminal 

 joints caducious. The first joint is always much the longest, the second 

 very short and often imperfectly differentiated, the others increasing 

 in length more or less irregularly to the end, givuig the impression of 




488 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



a budding zone at the distal end of the basal segment. The type speci- 

 men, which has suffered less from maceration than the others, has the 

 median tentacle with twenty-one articulations reaching to the middle 

 of VI, the inner lateral thirteen articulations reaching IV, and 

 the outer lateral seven articulations reaching II. Eyes black, some- 

 what elongated and crowded into the recess behind and between the 

 bases of the lateral tentacles. 



Peristomium considerably longer than the prostomium and slightly 

 wider than its widest part, the anterior third distinctly separated dor- 

 sally as a ring which is sometimes elevated prominently above the head. 

 The principal ring presents the usual lateral or mandibular lobes and 

 a smooth unfurrowed ventral lip. The nuchal cirri have the characters 

 of the tentacles, about equal the peristomium in length and have four 

 to seven articulations. Somite II is very short, scarcely more than 

 one-fourth of the prostomium, V is slightly enlarged, and behind it 

 the remaining somites are of nearly uniform length until they begin 

 to diminish at the posterior end. They are all smooth, simple and, 

 especial!}^ in the branchial region, very clearly defined. A short 

 cylindrical pygidium bears a pair of short stiff cirri and la.terad of these, 

 but still ventral to the anus, a pair of long, slender, flexible cirri equal- 

 ling the fifteen terminal segments. 



The first parapodium is strictly ventro-lateral ; those following rise 

 gradually to a half-way level. In form they imdergo the changes 

 usual in the genus, their chief characteristic being the prominence of 

 the cirri, which are retained both dorsally and ventrally throughout the 

 entire length of the worm. The dorsal cirri are especially prominent 

 and distinctly articulated anteriorly where each consists of a larger 

 basal and two smaller joints, together equalling the basal one. About 

 XXV one of these disappears, and a little farther on the other, the cir- 

 rus at the same time becoming more slender, but remaining about twice 

 as long as the setigerous lobe; posteriorly, as the latter becomes 

 smaller, the cirrus is relatively much more slender, three or four times 

 the length of the setigerous lobe, and often faintly articulated. The 

 ventral cirrus also, while undergoing reduction in the middle region, 

 exceeds the setigerous lobe throughout and always bears a small ter- 

 minal joint. 



The branchiae are of tj^pical uniserial pinnate form, the main stem 

 curving mediad over the back and the end not being strongly bent 

 upward. The branches are long, slender and simple but never exceed 

 the dorsal cirri; they arise from the main stem at right angles, not 

 dichotomousl}^, and curve slightly mesiad. On two specimens they 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 489 



have the folloT^•ing average distribution and complexity : Begin on 

 V with one filament, 3 on VI, 5 or 6 on VII, 6 to 8 from Mil to XXX, 

 4 or o to XXIX. 3 to XLII, 2 to XLVI, 1 to LIV, and cease by LV. 



The first parapodium (III) is supported by a pair of pale yellow, 

 simple pointed, sharply bevelled aciculi (PI. XXXVII, fig. 13), and 

 bears a small number of ventral compound and dorsal capillary setse, 

 as well as one or two spatulate setae. On IV the number of each kind, 

 especially the last, is increased. By VI the typical number, size and 

 arrangement is attained. The neuropodial aciculi are two or rarely 

 three, stout and blunt, and in the case of one somewhat enlarged at the 

 end (PI. XXXVII, fig. 14). Between XL and L a single ventral crochet 

 appears, and the dorsal aciculi become tapered and slightly curved 

 at the end (PI. XXXVII, fig. 15). The number of both compoimd 

 and capillary setse decreases in this region, and in the posterior somites 

 the latter seem to be absent altogether. The compound setse also un- 

 dergo a slight alteration in form. The dorsal cirrus throughout is sup- 

 ported by about three slender aciculi. 



The compound setse (PI. XXXVII, fig. 10) are all rather slender, 

 nearly colorless, have curved, finely striated stems moderately enlarged 

 at the ends; the appendix is not over two and one-half times the great- 

 est diameter of the stem, the end is prominently hooked and bidentate, 

 the accessory tooth distinctly triangular, guard narrow, scarcely 

 covering the end. From the posterior branchial region caudad the 

 hook gradually dimmishes, while the accessory tooth increases in 

 size, the base of the appendix becomes more oblique, and the end of 

 the shaft more strongly curved and thicker (PI. XXXVII, fig. 11), 

 Throughout most of the branchial region the compound setse are ar- 

 ranged in a nearly complete circle somewhat open both dorsally and 

 ventrally. 



The capillary setaj form a dense dorsal tuft reaching far beyond the 

 compound setse. They are pale greenish or nearly colorless, curved, 

 finely pointed and faintly obliquely striated (PI. XXXVII, fig. 12). 

 Back as far as the end of the branchial region they exhibit a slight 

 enlargement in the outer third, but posteriorly are strictly capillary. 

 Spatulate setse (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 42) form a close dorsal tuft at the 

 base of the capillary. They are colorless and very delicate, the ends 

 half round with the outer angles prolonged and the distal margin 

 folded and split into nine or ten processes tipped with short filaments 

 which bend abruptly inward nearly at a right angle. These setae 

 appear as a single one or two in the first ijarapodinm and continue to 

 C at least. 




490 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The jaws (PI. XXXVII, fig. IS) are delicate and nearly colorless, 

 except in the thickest parts, which are browTi. The maxillae are slen- 

 der, acute and at the base extend beyond the small carriers laterally. 

 The basal dorsal plates have five or six teeth, and the much smaller 

 anterior plates six and ten teeth on the left and right side respectively. 

 The extra plate on the left side has six teeth. 



Even in alcohol the colors of this species are well preserved and rich. 

 The cuticle is everyw^here smooth, polished and iridescent. For most 

 of its length the body is beautifuUy annulated with a rich browTi on a 

 creamy- white ground. Each somite is marked on the dorsum with 

 two narrow brown half rings separated from each other by an often 

 impure area of the ground color, often divided by a narrow transverse 

 brown line, and from the bands of the neighboring somites by a nar- 

 rower, purer and more sharply defined intersegmental ring, also usually 

 divided in the middle by a narrow transverse line. A dark median 

 dorsal line is also often evident. The ventral colors are more obsciu-e, 

 but each somite in the anterior region has a dull bro\\Ti cross-stripe. 

 Farther back the stripes break into a paired series of spots replaced 

 posteriorly by a series of narrow median spots, three on each segment, 

 a very small one in the furrow, followed by a considerable interval, 

 then a larger spot, a small interval and then the largest, an oval spot 

 which extends over nearly one-half the length of the somite. The 

 sides of the segments and, except anteriorly, the parapodia are color- 

 less. For about the first ten somites the browTi color becomes richer 

 and nearly continuous on the dorsum, except that the somewhat en- 

 larged fifth segment is pure white and conspicuous and the ninth is 

 chiefly white. On the caudal region of the body the color approaches 

 orange and becomes more suffused. Except for a row of minute dots 

 about its dorsal posterior margin and a pair of larger spots at the base 

 of the caudal cirri, the pygidium is white. The head is pale below with 

 a browTi spot in the ventral furrow ; above its anterior half and a nar- 

 row median triangle extending from the base of the median tentacle to 

 the posterior margin are brown, the rest pale. All of the tentacles, 

 tentacular cirri and the anterior dorsal cirri are similarly colored ; the 

 ceratophore and all of the constrictions are brown, the enlargements 

 white, resulting in a very sharply defined color annulation. The longer 

 anal cirri are chiefly bro^Ti with white rings. 



Lumbriconereis erecta n. s. (PL XXXVII, figs. 19 to 22; PI. XXXVIII, figs. 23 to 25.) 



The form and general aspect are about as usual in the genus, though 

 the unusual length and prominence of the lobes of the posterior para- 

 podia overcomes the trimness general to these worms. Full-grown

specimens are 300 mm. or more in length, and have a width of 3.5 mm. 

 without and 5 mm. including the parapodia. The usual number of 

 somites is about 330. The prostomium is sugar-loaf shaped in outline, 

 slightly depressed, the length slightly exceeding the basal width, the 

 apex narrowly rounded; at the base it is slightly mortised into the 

 peristomium above and on the sides is marked by a pair of faint 

 oblique grooves, in front of which are a few pigment spots but no dis. 

 tinct eyes; on the middle of the lower surface is a shallow median de- 

 pression. Mouth large, bounded laterally by a pair of prominent 

 L-shaped lobes connected with the peristomium, a much wrinkled fold 

 of which boimds the mouth posteriorly. The peristomium is divided 

 into two rings (perhaps somites) by a furrow which is very distinct 

 above, obsolete below; the jBrst ring equals the first setigerous somite, 

 the second is two-thirds as long. Body nearly terete, very slightly 

 depressed toward the ends; the somites all well marked, simple, 

 smooth except for a very slightly raised welt around the middle ; their 

 length nearly uniform, from one-third to one-fifth their width, which 

 is greatest at the middle. Toward the posterior end of the body there 

 is a faint neural groove. The pygidium is a small platform ventral to 

 the anus and provided with a pair of prominent short and thick bifid 

 cirri, the median lobes of which come into contact in the median line. 

 In the middle region of the body the parapodia are situated about 

 midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces which are equally con- 

 vex, but toward the ends they assume a lower level and the ventral 

 surface becomes flattened. The parapodia (PI. XXXVII, figs. 19-21) 

 have a short, thick rounded base, a very small notopodial tubercle 

 which receives four to six aciculi, a presetal lobe which is very short, 

 thick and rounded throughout the series, and a prominent postsetal lobe 

 which gradually increases in size from before backward, and in the 

 middle and posterior regions has the form of a long finger-like process 

 which generally bends abruptly upward at a right angle and rises above 

 the back. The setse are of the usually acute, winged and the hooded, 

 hooked forms and vary greatly in details and particularly in the degree 

 of curvature and geniculation. The anterior parapodia contain the 

 acute type only (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 23 and 24), at first in a somewhat 

 broken fan-shaped tuft, but soon in a dorsal group of longer and 

 middle and ventral groups of shorter setse. At about XLV, guarded 

 uncini (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 25) appear in the ventral group, and by L 

 are alone present to the number of four or five, which is further reduced 

 to two or even one posteriorly. The ventral setse of the dorsal bundle 

 exhibit a reduction in size at about L, and by LX have given place 




492 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [-May, 



to uncini. but the slender setse do not altogether disappear until about 

 LXXV, from which point backward the uncini become stouter and the 

 number gradually reduced to from one to three in each parapodium. 



The jaws are coarse, black and veiy brittle. The mandibles (PI. 

 XXX VH, fig 22) are pale, stout and broad, with the two halves 

 strongly united, especially by transverse striated bands across the end 

 pieces. The bases are broad and roughly laminated. 



Much of the original color has been lost, but the head and anterior 

 region of the body retains a rich bronze with a beautiful blue and 

 green iridescence; the posterior part is dull browii, due to heavy 

 masses of pigment which are scattered everyiA^here through the deeper 

 integmnent, but especially in a narrow transverse band and a pair of 

 dorso-lateral spots on each somite. 

 Cirratulus spirabranehus n. s. (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 26 and 27.) 



Form rather stout, thickest in middle and tapermg almost equally 

 both waA's. The type is 105 mm. long and 5.5 mm. in diameter at the 

 wddest part. Prostomium elongated, pointed and slightly depressed, 

 with a short oblique groove on each side above and near the union 

 with the peristomium. No eyes visible. Peristomium enlarged, its 

 length equal to six succeedmg somites, somewhat irregularly di\aded 

 into three or four rings of which the last is much longer than the others. 

 There are about 300 setigerous somites, of which the fu-st three or four 

 are longer than the others. Nearly terete, but slightly flattened ven- 

 trally where the muscle coats are considerably thickened particularly 

 toward the ends. All somites clearly marked, but short and imiannu- 

 late. The anus is a large dorsal slit reaching through 7 or 8 faintly 

 marked somites and followed by a minute tubercle-like pygidium. 



The branchiae are numerous and crowded and usually more or less 

 spirally coiled. They differ much in size, probably, however, only as 

 a result of loss and regeneration, but their length does not exceed 

 about five times the diameter of the body. Beginning with the first 

 setigerous a pair occurs on every somite except the last thirty, arising 

 immediately dorsad of the notopodial setse or from the margin of the 

 elevated band just above them. On the seventh setigerous somite 

 occur the special branchise in a pair of dense tufts of about 20, arranged 

 in two transverse rows which nearly meet medially. They are mostly 

 smaller than the ordinary branchise, and owing to the crowding of this 

 region usually appear to cover two somites, either ^TI and VIII or 

 VIII and IX. 



The setigerous tubercles (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 26, 27) are separated 

 by a smooth space about 3 or 4 times as broad as they, and both are 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 493 



placed on a wide elevated band, the dorsal margin of which rises 

 prominently about the notopodial tubercles and bears the branchiae on 

 its edge. The usual spines and capillary setae are present, distributed 

 as follows: Anterior to somite XL the latter only occur. ])nt at XL 

 or thereabout small, nearly colorless spines appear among the capillary 

 bristles in the neuropodial fascicles; by L there are usually five, quite 

 distinct and dark colored, though small; they alternate with the setae, 

 and as the latter diminish the former increase in number, the maximum 

 of six being found from about C to CL, behind which the capillary setae 

 have nearly or quite disappeared, and the number of the spines be- 

 comes again reduced to foiu- or five, a nimiber which remains constant 

 to the end, though further diminution in size occurs. In the notopodial 

 fascicles the spines are smaller, slightly more numerous and first appear 

 a little more caudad than in the ventral fascicles. 



Cirratulus luxuriosus n. s. (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 28 to 31.) 



Form slender throughout, thickest at about end of anterior third 

 (somite C), tapering thence very gently to posterior end. The type 

 and largest specimen is 110 mm. long and 4.5 mm. in diameter at somite 

 C. In the best-preserved specimens the body is strongly convex above, 

 concave below and angulated at the setae levels, particularly the neuro- 

 podial. Prostomium about three-fifths as long as broad, rounded 

 anteriorly, depressed, slightly retracted within the peristomium, 

 grooved below in the middle line, thus leaving a pair of lateral palp- 

 like thickenings which bound the mouth above; no eyes nor sensory 

 slits apparent. Peristomium somewhat inflated, about twice as long 

 as the prostomium and divided into two or three annuli. Setigerous 

 annuli numerous (358 in the type), all very short and distinct, those of 

 the posterior third rather longer and with faint indications of irregu- 

 lar division into two wings. The branchiae form a conspicuous tangled 

 mass, and even in the alcoholic specimens are verj^ long, equalling ten 

 times the diameter of the body but, unlike C. spirabranchus, exhibiting 

 little tendency to coil spirally. They begin on the first setigerous 

 somite in contact with the notopodia above, but continually rise to a 

 higher level, imtil toward the posterior end they are much nearer to the 

 dorsal middle line than to the setae. To the 200th somite at least a 

 pair of branchiae occurs on every somite, but for the next 70 or SO 

 on every second, third or fourth somite only; there is no diminution in 

 size posteriorly. The special branchiae are in a pair of close tufts 

 crowded on the sides principally of the fourth setigerous somite. The 

 number appears to be 12 or 14 on each side, but cannot be ascertained 




494 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



with certainty. Anus rather small, nearly transverse, widely open 

 and succeeded by a small median ventral tubercle. 



The setigerous tubercles (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 28 to 30) are very 

 small, not elevated on any special muscular band, though appearing 

 at the lateral angles posteriorly, and are well separated throughout. 

 The first 30 somites bear capillary setse only. Spines appear at that 

 point in the ventral fascicle and soon become thick and dark browTi. 

 By XL there are usually four of these spines associated with capillary 

 setae, but the number soon becomes reduced to three, the number of 

 capillary seise simultaneously diminishing. From CXX to CL there are 

 two spines and the capillary setae have disappeared ; beyond CL there 

 is one (or rarely two) large, stout, nearly black spine which continues 

 to increase gradually in size. Toward the posterior end a reverse 

 change begins, and behind CCC there are usually two comparatively 

 slender and pale spines. In the notopodial fascicles spines appear later, 

 the first at about I;. At about C three small pale spines usually occur, 

 with the capillary setae. The fascicles undergo changes analogous to 

 those just described, but in the same segment the spines are almost 

 always more numerous, not over one-third as large and always asso- 

 ciated with capillary setae. 



Maldane disparidentata n. s. (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 28 to 31.) 



The length of complete examples is from 100 to 150 mm., and 4 to 6 

 mm. in diameter in the somewhat contracted state; some fragments 

 indicate specimens of larger size. Probably o^dng in part to contraction, 

 as indicated by a distinct fold of the first setigerous somite which over- 

 laps the head ventrally, the latter is truncated with little obliquity; its 

 V ntral length, including the united prostomium and peristomium, 

 is scarcely one-third more than the dorsal. Cephalic plate broadly 

 oblong-elliptical, its width at least four-fifths its length, the surface 

 smooth and slightly elevated in the center. The frontal ridge low, 

 broad and inconspicuous; beginning just anterior to this elevation and 

 ending anteriorly in the palpode ; its length equal to one-third the cepha- 

 lic plate; posteriorly one-third as wide as the plate, gradually widening 

 for its posterior half, then suddenly expanding into the palpode which 

 is broad, thick, rounded, smooth and separated from the cephalic 

 margin laterally by onl}^ a slight emargination. Sensory slits short, 

 sharply defined but inconspicuous. Cephalic margin nowhere much 

 produced, low and thick, probably in part the result of contraction; 

 a pair of lateral clefts divide the posterior one-third from the anterior 

 two-thirds. The former is lower, embraces the latter at the sides and 

 has its margin divided into about fifteen low, broad, truncate teeth. 




J 904,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 495 



very irregular and inconstant in different individuals, but always dimin- 

 ishing in size and distinctness toward the posterior middle line and 

 often grouped in pairs. The lateral lobes, which reach forward to 

 the palpode, are considerably more elevated and bear five or six larger, 

 iriore prominent, rounded teeth. The mouth is a conspicuous opening 

 bounded behind by a transverse fold and laterally by distinct thickened 

 lobes. Behind it is a distinct peristomial half-ring rendered more 

 conspicuous by contraction. 



There are nineteen setigerous somites, the first seven thick-walled 

 and largely glandular, the first six strongly biannulate with the anterior 

 ring larger and setigerous. This region is usually slightly depressed 

 with each of the first six somites about as long as wide, but the unian- 

 nular seventh only equalling the larger anterior ring of the others. 

 Behind VIII the somites increase gradually in length and become some- 

 what narrower to XVI, which is three times as long as wide; XVIII, 

 XIX and XX become successively shorter. From the eighth to the 

 nineteenth inclusive the parapodia are posterior in position, and the 

 more anterior are situated on complete glandular zones which soon be- 

 come incomplete and restricted to the lateral faces of the somites. 

 Distinct constrictions occur at the intermetameric furrows which are 

 rendered much more conspicuous by the prominent tori preceding them. 

 The surface of all somites is more or less annularly furrowed and bears 

 numerous small glandular and sensory papillae. The last somite (XXI) 

 bears no setae and is smooth and uniannulated. Caudally it enlarges and 

 passes gradually into the anal funnel, dorsad of which the anus is situ- 

 ated behind a somewhat wrinkled anterior fold. The anal funnel con- 

 sists of two parts, the ventral funnel proper, the cavity of which reaches 

 to the anterior end of the anal segment while the margin is even and 

 not at all flaring, and the dorsal platform, which arises within the dorsal 

 part of the ventral funnel and spreads in a flat, broad petaloid form 

 vertically behind the anus. The margins of both parts are slightly 

 irregular, but entirely without lobes or processes. 



On the anterior somites the parapodia are strictly lateral, on the 

 posterior ventro-lateral and more prominent. Somite II bears setae 

 alone. III to XX both dorsal setae and ventral uncini. The setaj are 

 of three forms w^hich, however, vary and intergrade. The several 

 kinds arise in more or less distinct fascicles, but spread in such a man- 

 ner that they appear at the surface m pairs or triplets composed of one 

 of each kind; thus on II they form a fan-shaped figure of about 25 

 pairs, on III about 15, on 1\ 12, on V 10 and a more irregular arrange- 

 ment in triples on the abdominal segments. Slender capillary wingless 




496 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [^lay , 



setse, rather abruptly attenuated at the surface of the body wall, occur 

 in all setigerous somites. The anterior ones project about one-third 

 as far ar the larger setse, but in the posterior segments they become 

 much longer and filamentous. Winged setse also occiu- in all somites. 

 They are about three or four times the diameter of the smaller ones in 

 their exposed parts and quite deeply colored, nearly straight, tapered 

 to an acute tip, broadly winged on one margin and very slightly on 

 the other. The stoutest ones occur in the posterior thoracic somites, 

 where also setse of intermediate form are present, some of the smaller 

 ones ha^dng short basal wings. In the abdominal bvmdles most of 

 the larger setse are provided wdth delicate doubly spirally fringed tips 

 (PI. XXXVm, fig. 35) w^hich differ considerably in length, the longest 

 in the middle abdominal region forming more than one-half of the 

 exposed portion. Posteriorly the number of setse is reduced, the fila- 

 mentous ones predominating. 



The uncini are all rather stout and of a deep j'ellow color; 7 or 8 

 occur on III, about 10 on Y, and about 35 on VIII and the following 

 somites. On somites III to V the uncini have the form sho\^^l in PL 

 XXXVIII, fig. 32. The stems are very slightly curved, strongly stri- 

 ated and have a scarcely perceptible shoulder ; the heads are but little 

 enlarged with a blunt pointed beak bent at an angle of 100° to 120°; 

 a crest composed of two rows of teeth, the anterior with a few large 

 teeth in the middle, the posterior and lateral smaller, and a simple 

 guard of about 12 spreading hairs ending at the tip of the beak. On 

 the remaining somites the crochets form a much longer row and have 

 the stems more curved, the shoulder larger, the head more expanded, 

 the beak much longer, more acute, much more strongly hooked at an 

 acute angle, the crest more elevated, with the smaller teeth in more 

 numerous rows and more closely embracing the base of the beak, and 

 the guard arising from a distinct flange beloAv a re-entering angle (PI. 

 XXXVIII, fig. 33). 



This species is represented by a large number of examples. 



Terebella (Schmardanella) californica n. ?. (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 36, 37.) 



This species has the general aspect of Amphitrite spiralis Johnson, 

 from which it is readily separated by the much smaller number of 

 setigerous somites in addition to other characters. The type measures 

 75 mm. from the pygidium to the tip of the prostomium, but another 

 less perfect specimen is nearly twice as large ; the diameter at X is 3.3 

 mm. The prostomium is prominent, little arched, projects forward 

 and is faintly trilobed its margin slightl}- revolute and its lateral por-

tion distinctly reflexed. Eyes absent. Tentacles very numerous, 

 deeply grooved, arising from the posterior border of the prostomimn 

 for its entire width in three or four transverse crowded rows, behind 

 which is a slightly elevated border. Most of the tentacles are colorless, 

 but usually some are pale brown. Mouth large with a broad peris- 

 tomial lower lip. Peristomiiun about as long as succeeding somites, 

 distinctly visible as a ring both above and below. 



Branchiae two pairs on the posterior part of somites II and III, the 

 first just anterior to the first setae tuft, the second above and^behind it. 

 All of the branchiae are prominent, and of about equal size. They 

 are of a spreading bushy form; the main stem very short, dichotomy 

 occurring almost immediately and the outermost branch again dividing 

 at once, so that three main branches appear to arise almost separately. 

 After about foiu- or five dichotomous divisions, which are usually un- 

 equal, one or two irregular divisions occur, the result being a very 

 large number of terminal tvngs. When contracted the minor divisions 

 coil inward toward the axis, so that the gill presents a very compact 

 appearance. There is, however, much irregiilarity in this respect, 

 some of the filaments merely shortening, others coiling spirally. 



The body is slender and club-shaped, nearly terete throughout the 

 abdominal region, gently tapered to the anus and the anterior end of 

 the thorax somewhat enlarged. The thoracic segments increase 

 slightly in diameter to about X, and then decrease very gradually into 

 the abdominal region. The dorsum is regularly arched, the venter 

 somewhat angulated, flattened or slightly convex, according to the 

 state of the specimen. Above the somites are somewhat indistinctly 

 separated and somewhat irregularly divided into three rings which are 

 usually again biannulate. On the ventral half the intersegmental fm- 

 rows are well marked and the somites only biannulated. This region 

 is also rough and thickened, and separated from the faintly granu- 

 lated, thin-walled dorsal region by a longitudinal groove belowi,which 

 is a ridge-like row of glandular thickenings. The first one or two ven- 

 tral plates are very short. They increase in length to the tenth, and 

 in width decrease regularly and gradually to the sixteenth, which is 

 square, while the tenth is twice, and the fifth three times as wide as 

 long. Usually a cross-furrow divides each one and the surface is 

 wrinkled. On most specimens the fifth or sixth plate is sunken below 

 the general surface. Behind the sixteenth they become very small, 

 but may be traced for some distance further. The thorax passes very 

 gradually into the abdomen, which is very prominently arched and 

 thin-walled, the somites numerously and finely ringed and indistinctly 

 32

separated from one another. At the posterior end the metamerism 

 becomes obscure and the pygidium is truncated. 



.' Throughout the thoracic and much of the abdominal region the 

 uncinigerous tori are prominent. They begin on V, increase in length 

 to about XIII, remain practically uniform to about XX, and then very 

 gradually diminish, the last thoracic bemg about equal to the seventh. 

 As they become smaller and the ventral plates narrower, the tori are 

 carried more and more to the ventral surface, until in the middle ab- 

 dominal region they form bead-like swellings on a pair of muscular 

 ndges separated by a narrow median groove. Toward the posterior 

 end theyi are barely recognizable. Setigerous tubercles begin on IV, 

 and continue for from twenty-three to twenty-eight somites, twenty- 

 six being the most frequent number. They stand out prominently 

 from the dorsal end of the tori, especially the anterior ones, which bear 

 the greatest number of setae. "VlTiitish glandular thickenings occur 

 just dorsad[of the setse lobes as far as somite XXII and prominent 

 nephridial papillse from VII to XX inclusive, and less prominently 

 and regularly on some of the succeeding somites. 



The setse (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 36) are noteworthy for the prominence 

 of their pennant-like fringed tips. They are arranged as a single row 

 of larger ones flanked on one or both sides by a row of smaller setse. 

 The former are straight or slightly curved, with about one-half of the 

 exposed portion included in a loose sheath beginning abruptly and 

 tapering to the terminal pennant which begins as a sudden, much 

 flattened, very thin angulated expansion, curved strongly to one side, 

 tapered to a delicate point and prominently fringed on one margin. 

 The smaller setse are little more than one-half as thick as their exposed 

 parts, only half as long as the larger. Their form is generally similar, 

 but the' sheath is less evident and the tips broader, longer and more 

 abruptly bent to one side. Setse of the first tuft are more slender and 

 of the posterior ones fewer than elsewhere. 



The uncini (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 37) are biserial and opposite on XI 

 and aU following somites; uniserial on those anterior to XI. They 

 have a rather short base strongly convex below with a prominent toe, 

 a small posterior ligament process and a subrostral process with a 

 guard; the sinus is narrow with subparallel sides, the beak long, acute 

 and strongly hooked and the crest prominent, elevated and composed of 

 three or four transverse tooth rows, the lowermost large. On the 

 posterior somites the uncini are small, lack the posterior ligament 

 process and are consequently less angulated and they have a larger 

 number of teeth in the crest.

Distylia rugosa n. .«. (PI. XXXVIII, figs. 38 to 41.) 



This is a large, handsome species, somewhat resembling Bispira 

 polymorpha Johnson, but differing from that species in the fewer spiral 

 turns of the branchial base, the greater number of branchial radioles, 

 the arrangement of the eyes, the form of the spatulate thoracic setse 

 and pick-shaped uncini and probably the deep rugous dorsal folds. 



Exclusive of the branchiae, the type is 67 mm. long, the width at the 

 posterior end of the thorax to the middle abdominal region being 8 

 mm. and the depth at the same points 6 and 5 mm. respectively. The 

 ventral ends of the stiff, cartilage-Uke branchial bases are prolonged 

 and spirally coiled, but make only 1| turns. The radioles, which reach 

 a length of 22 mm. at the dorsal and somewhat less at the ventral end 

 of the series, arise to the number of 58 on the left, 55 on the right, in a 

 crowded, closely interlocking double row from the entire distal margin 

 of the basal lobes. Each is strictly simple and perfectly free from the 

 others to the base; the outer surface is rounded and the inner bears 

 the numerous barbs, which have a length about twice the diameter of 

 the radiole, in a crowded double series for- its entire length except a 

 short naked terminal region. In this species the eyes are less perfect 

 but far more numerous than in D. polymorpha, the number on each 

 radiole approximating 100. They are very irregularly distributed in 

 groups on both margins, most plentifully on the distal half, where a 

 very constant group of large eye-spots occurs just proximad of the 

 naked tip. In the type the branchiae are pale-colored, each plume 

 \\'ith three bro\\Ti spots, one near the base and two in the outer half ; 

 the other specimen has the gills almost continuously pale reddish- 

 brown mottled with white, especially on the basal half. The palpal 

 membrane has a free margin completely encu-cling the bases of the 

 branchial radioles mthin. It extends around the sides of the mouth, 

 ventrad to which the two halves meet as a pair of vertical plates con- 

 tiguous to the middle line, and entering the ventral coUar incision 

 partly join the somewhat swollen bases of the ventral collar lobes. 

 The tentacles are about as long as the basal branchial lobes, and have 

 the basal half broadly margined, the distal half filamentous. 



The collar is rather thick, stiff', flaring and prominent throughout 

 its extent. The dorsal opening is equal to nearly ^ the body width at 

 the peristomium, with the broadly rounded dorsal lobes bounding it 

 slightly, curving around the dorsal side of the first pair of setae fascicles, 

 but free from them. The ventral opening is narrow but deep and, as 

 mentioned above, is partly occupied by the ventral prolongations of 

 the circumoral membrane ; on each side of it arc the short, broad and 




500 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



thick ventral lobes. There is a pair of slight lateral emarginations, but 

 no well-marked incisions. 



Except at the rounded peristomium the body is depressed. It in- 

 creases in width to the end of the thorax, from which point it diminishes 

 very gently to the posterior one-tenth or beyond, and then very rapidly 

 to the small pygidium, on each side of which is a conspicuous cluster 

 of numerous brown pigmented eye-spots. There are 8 setigerous 

 thoracic and 107 abdominal segments. The coalesced peristomium 

 and first setigerous somite are about twice as long as succeeding somites. 

 Besides the collar they bear an undivided, very thick ventral plate, 

 which is about twice as long and much wider than any succeeding 

 thoracic plate, but about equal in the latter respect to the first abdomi- 

 nal. The remaining thoracic plates are about equal in length, but 

 from the third, which is the narrowest, they increase gradually in 

 width to the last. Owing to lateral extensions anterior to the unci- 

 nigerous tori, the margins of the ventral plates are strongly serrated. 

 The abdominal ventral plates are also thick and occupy about three- 

 fifths of the ventral area. Widest at the anterior end, the first 15 or 

 20 become gradually narrower, after which there is no change until at 

 the posterior end of the body they diminish correspondingly. Through- 

 out they are sharply defined by straight margins. In the alcoholic 

 specimens all of the segments are short and sharply defined, and an 

 extensive area on the dorsal surface is thrown into very deep rugous 

 glandular folds, occupying on the posterior one-thu'd of the type speci- 

 men the entire width of the dorsal area, but anteriorly becoming lower 

 and more and more restricted to the middle region until they finally 

 fade out. On the second specimen they are less conspicuously devel- 

 oped, but are otherwdse similar. A well-marked facal groove divides 

 the abdominal ventral plates into equal halves to the first, cuts this 

 obliquely to the left and passes dorsad in the thoracico-abdominal 

 groove to the level of the abdominal setae tufts, and then obliquely 

 across the last thoracic somite dorsal to its setae tuft to the middle line, 

 along which it proceeds as a deep and conspicuous groove to the dorsal 

 collar opening. 



All setse tufts are large and prominent, the abdominal strictly verti- 

 cal and ventral, the thoracic dorsal and slightly obique, except the first, 

 which is nearly horizontal, entirely free from the collar and slightly 

 smaller than the others. The uncinigerous tori are also well marked, on 

 the thoracic somites meeting the ventral plates below and slightly 

 hooked backward above. The first pair, on the second setigerous 

 somite, are the longest; the seventh and last about three-fourths as 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 501 



long; reduction in length takes place at both ends and the setae tufts 

 descend to a correspondingly lower level. All abdominal tori are 

 shorter than the last thoracic and they diminish gradually and con- 

 stantly to the posterior end. They are especially prominent dorsally 

 where they terminate in a prominent projection marked with a con- 

 spicuous black spot. 



All setse are nearly colorless, translucent and striated. Those of the 

 first or collar fascicle are all of one form, slender, narrowly lanceolate, 

 slightly curved and with a single narrow wing, but differ consider- 

 ably in length. On other thoracic somites those in the dorsal rows of 

 the bimdles are similar (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 38), but the ventral ones 

 (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 39) are shorter, spatulate, doubly winged, and have 

 acute but not mucronate tips ; they differ somewhat in curvature and 

 breadth of wings, but the one figured is typical. The abdominal setse 

 are again all of one kind, rather more broadly lanceolate than, but 

 otherwdse similar to, those of the collar fascicle. 



The thoracic imcini are of two kinds — large aviculse and smaller 

 pick-shaped hooks, arranged in opposed parallel rows, there being 105 

 of each on II, 97 on V, and 90 on VIII on the type specimen. The 

 aviculse (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 40) are of a very pale yellow, the bases 

 long, slender, slightly curved; the neck and head prominent and erect, 

 slightly inclined forward; the breast prominent, hemispherical; the 

 neck slightly tapered and about as long as thick at the base, the head 

 scarcely enlarged with the rather stout but acute beak strongly bent 

 downward, the crest little elevated and forming a dense sheath of fine 

 spines arranged in numerous transverse and longitudinal rows closely 

 appressed on the upper half of the beak. Abdominal aviculse differ 

 only in their somewhat shorter bases and less prominent breasts. They 

 are not associated with pick-shaped uncini and the type specimen has 

 about 80 in each torus. 



The pick-shaped uncini (PI. XXXVIII, fig. 41) have stems about as 

 long as the bases of the aviculse, but much more slender; they are 

 nearly straight, but more or less slightly enlarged and bent at about the 

 beginning of the outer one-third. The tip cm-ves to a short blunt 

 point enclosed within a loose expanded hood, from which arises a deli- 

 cate, colorless, very slender process, making an angle of about 60*^ 

 with the stem. 



Except as already described for the branchise, all pigment has faded 

 out. Distylia Quatrefages is employed instead of the earlier Bispira 

 Kroyer, because the author of the latter seems never to have applied 

 the name to any species.

THE FISHES OF NANTUCKET. 

 BY DR. BENJAMIN SHARP AND HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Fish are taken in Xan tucket by hand-lines, trolling, line-trawls, 

 diift- and set-nets and pounds or traps. Hand-lining is employed for 

 scup, plaice, flatfish, cod, haddock, and in times past for dogfish and 

 halibut. The line-trawls are used in the spring and fall for cod and 

 haddock, drift-nets in the spring for mackerel, set-nets in the summer 

 and fall for bluefish and bonito. The two pounds fixed in water of 

 about 4 fathoms are inside, that is on the west of Great Point, about 

 midway between the Koskata U. S. Life Sa\dng Station and Great 

 Point Lighthouse. These pounds are the property of the Petrel Fishing 

 Company, which employs a small steamer and a saUboat. Every 

 species of commercial fish foimd about the island has been taken in 

 the pound, and many others mentioned in this list. Bluefish are very 

 rarely found in them. During the spring of the year the steamer 

 Petrel is employed drifting for mackerel off the south side of the islands 

 of Nantucket and Tuckemuck. During the summer she steams around 

 the island for bluefish and an occasional trip is made for swordfish, 

 when she cruises some 30 or 40 miles from the land. The bluefish are 

 taken^by sweeping nets around a school of fish. This is done by dories 

 which put out from the steamer when a school is discovered. 



The steamer Waquoit is also employed in fishing for mackerel, sword- 

 fish and bluefish. This steamer and the Petrel are the only two steam 

 fishing-boats owned in Nantucket. 



The line-trawls are used in the spring and fall in the cod and haddock 

 fisheries. These are set from dories which put out from the beaches 

 on the south and east sides of the island when the weather permits, 

 and on returning are hauled up out of the surf to a safe place and the 

 fish carted to town. 



At Quidnet there are a number of houses where the Portuguese salt 

 codfish. Salting and drying codfish is also carried on by a number 

 of fishermen from the Cape. They have established a small \allage on 

 Coatuc ("New Chatham"), and in catboats sail out of the "opening" 

 at the head of the harbor and fish off the eastern side of the island. 



A gasoline-power boat, the San Antonio, has recently been biult by 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 505 



some enterprising Portuguese on Nantucket, and is employed in various 

 kinds of fishing about the island. 



The set-nets, used in the fall for catching bonito, are hung in the 

 "Cod" of the Bay — the sheet of water enclosed by the arm of the 

 island called Great Point. 



Collections of Nantucket fishes have been made by the senior wiiter 

 and presented by him to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 

 phia. The * affixed to certain species indicates that material from 

 this source has been examined. 



In conclusion, we -^dsh to thank the members of the "Petrel Com- 

 pany " for their kindness and interest in helping us in this work. 



PETROMYZONTID^. 

 Petromyzon marinus Linnoeus. (" Lamprey.") 



Specimen taken in the pound, April 28, 1904, about 3 feet in length. 



aALEORHINID^. 



♦Mustelus canis (Mitchill). 



Found associated wdth Squahis acanthias.- 



Prionace glauca (Linnaeus). ("Blue Dog." "Man-eater.") 



Caught vnth. the sand shark {Carcharias littoralis), but by no means 

 so common. 



"Sharking" is one of the sports of the island. Those caught are 

 not used now commercially. Some years ago, when "sharking" was 

 carried on regularly at Wawinet, a village at the head of the harbor, 

 the livers of all the sharks caught were saved, dried out in the sun and 

 the oil shipped away. 



Carcharhinus obscurus (Le Sueur) ? 



About 6 or 8 examples probably of this or some closely related 

 species have been taken at various times at or near Great Point. A 

 large example was taken by the senior writer during the summer of 

 1877, weighing 650 pounds. It measured 11 feet 6 inches. 



SPHYRNID^. 



♦Sphyrna zygaena (Linnaeus). 



Two examples seen. One washed ashore many years ago, and another 

 taken in a set-net September 25, 1903. The latter examined by the 

 junior writer. 



ALOPIID^. 



Alopias vulpes (Gmelin). ("Thrasher.") 



T\\'0 examples seen. Both taken at Great Point, one with a line 

 and the other in the pound. The tail of the latter measured 7^ feet. 




506 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [May, 



LAMNID^. 

 Isurus dekayi (Gill) 7 (" Mackerel Shark.") 



Taken in the spring in the mackerel drift-nets. 



CAROHARIID^. 



♦Carcharias littoralis (Mitchill). (" Sand Shark.") 



This is the commonest shark in these waters. They are taken on 

 lines and sometimes rolled up in the set-nets. Occasionally in the har- 

 bor. A small one was taken a few years ago in one of the docks. It 

 measured about 5 feet. 



SQUALID^. 



Squalus acanthias Linnaeus. (" Dog Fish.") 



They breed on the bar in May. Some years ago they were regularly 

 fished for by sailboats. They were so plentiful that it was the custom 

 to break off the barb of the hook to make it easier to get the fish off 

 when caught. They are a great nuisance to the mackerel fishermen, 

 not only in tearing the nets, but in mangling the mackerel already 

 in the net. In October, 1903, for two or three days they filled up the 

 pounds. 



RAJID^. 

 Kaja erinacea Mitchill. (" Skate.") 



Common all about the island and associated with — 



Eaja laevis (Mitchill). ("Skate.") 



MYLIOBATID^. 

 KMnoptera bonasus (Mitchill). 



Only one specimen seen. Taken in the pound, October 16, 1902. 



ACIPENSERID^. 

 Aoipenser sturio Linnaus. ("Sturgeon.") 



Often seen "breaking" (jumpitig out of water) on stiU days off the 

 east end of the island. Occasionally taken in the nets. 



ANGUILLID^. 

 *Anguilla chrisypa Rafine-sque. ("Eel.") 



Taken by spearing in shallow water in the harbor and in Madequet 

 "creek," a tide-water stream at the western end of the island. They 

 are also taken at night torching and with the " bob." In winter holes 

 are cut in the ice and the eel-spear thrust through into the mud and 

 many eels taken. This was especially resorted to in the long freeze-up 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 507 



of 1904. A perfect albino specimen was taken by Henry Folger in 

 the spring of 1903 and is now in the Academy's collection.^ 



ELOPID^. 

 *Elops saurus Linrueus. (" Lady Fish.") 



Taken in the pound in October, 1903. 



OLUPEID^. 

 Clupea harengus Linnseus. (" Herring.") 



Taken in the spring by opening the south head of the Hummock 

 pond (fresh-water) to the sea. As they run in they are scooped out 

 with hand-nets. Many remain through the summer in the pond after 

 it is closed. They are also taken in the pound. 



Pomolobus pseudoharengus (Wilson) ? (" Herring.") 

 Alosa sapidissima (Wilson). ("Shad.") 



A few taken in the pound in the spring of 1901. Tradition says that 

 they were common about the island before the bluefish became so 

 numerous. Thirty-six taken April 29, 1904, and 30 taken May 7, 

 1904, in the poimds. 



*Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe). ("Menhaden.") 



SALMONID^. 

 Salmo salar Linnaeus. ("Salmon.") 



One weighing 3^ pounds taken off Tuckernuck in the mackerel drift- 

 nets of the Waquoit on the night of May 6 and 7, 1904. 



PCEOILIID^. 

 *Fuiidulus majalis (Walbaum). (" Cat Fish.") 



Caught with the following about the wharves by boys, and the name 

 given as they are caught for cats' food. 



♦Fundulus lieteroclitus macrolepidotus (Walbaum). ("Cat Fish.") 



Abundant about the wharves. Used with the above for bait for 

 plaice fish. 



SYNGNATHID^. 

 Siphostoma fuscum (Storer). (" Pipe Fish.") 



Common on the bars in August and Sejitember. Associated \vith 

 and closely resembling floating eel-grass. This is undoubtedly a case 

 of color and form protection. 



*A spotted eel about four feet long has been noticed by the senior writer. 

 Three specimens were seen at different times, one on exhibition four or five years 

 ago and two were seen in October, 1902, which were sent to Albany by Sydney 

 Fisher. They were called Conger Eels by the fishermen, and thought to be related 

 to Murcena ocellata. 




508 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



ATHERINID^. 

 ♦Menidia notata (Mitchill). 



BELONID^. 

 *Tylosurus acus (LacdpMe). ("Bill Fish.") 



Rare. One taken September 23, 1901, and another August, 1903, 

 in the pound. 



SOOMBRID^. 



Scomber SCOmbrus Linnfeus. (" Mackerel.") 



Caught in drift-nets which are set at night off the south side of the 

 island in the spring of the year. Sometimes in the fall they are taken 

 on hand-lines in Nantucket Sound. Some taken also in the pounds. 

 First taken (in the pound) in 1904, April 28. On April 29, 32 taken; 

 on May 6 and 7, 160 taken by steamer Waquoit "drifting" off south 

 side. 



Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus). (" Horse Mackerel.") 



Caught around the island liy the Petrel with swordfish gear, and also 

 in the pounds. Schools of 60 or 70 have been seen. 



Sarda sarda (Bloch). ("Bonito.") 



Caught in set-nets through September and October, rarely caught 

 trolling. 



Scomberomorus maculatus (Mitchill). ("Spanish Mackerel.") 



TBICHIURIDiE. 

 *Tricliiurus lepturus Linnaeus. (" Hair Tail. ') 



Three large examples secured, four in all, taken in the pound in July, 

 1903. 



XIPHIID^. 

 Xiphias gladius Linnaeus. ("Sword Fish.") 



Common in July off the south side of the island, from 20 to 40 

 miles from the land. They are taken by the ordinary swordfish 

 gear by the steamers Petrel and Waquoit. Many years ago sail- 

 boats from Nantucket made a business of swordfishing. 



OARANGID^. 



*Seriola zonata (Mitchill). (" Rudder Fish.") 



Taken in pound, 1903. 



*Caranx crysos (Mitchill). ("Yellow Tail.") 



Taken in pound, 1903. 



Selene vomer (Linnaeus). (" Moon Fish.") 



A small example taken in the pound, September 26, 1901. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 509 



Traohinotus carolinus (Linnaeus). ("Pompano.") 



Two examples taken in the pound, September, 1901. 



POMATOMID^. 



Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnsus). ("Blue Fish.") 



These are taken by trolling in the Rips — Muskeget Rip, Great Point 

 Rip and Bass Rip (off Sankaty Head) — and for many years great 

 numbers were caught by boats in the opening which broke through 

 some fifty years ago between Nantucket and Tuckernuck. This place 

 is now given up. When the bluefish first became common about the 

 island, in the early 60's, they were caught in the harbor, now they 

 are rarely seen there. Set-nets were also used, but of late these are 

 but little used. The Petrel gets them off the south and east ends of 

 the island by means of sweep-nets. When a school is seen — and this 

 can be done at some distance by the terns which hover over them — 

 the net is shot from dories and pulled around the school, the fish in 

 darting away get gilled and are then taken from the net. 



"Heaving and hauling" — i.e., throwing a drail or leaded hook from 

 the shore and hauling in — is now occasionally done at the south shore, 

 and on September 26, 1903, an example weighing 27 pounds was taken. 

 This is considerably larger than the largest heretofore reported by 

 Jordan and Evermann, Food and Game Fishes, 1902, p. 321, where one 

 weighing 22 pounds and measuring 3 feet in length is mentioned. 



Up to 18S0 hundreds were often caught in an afternoon from the 

 south shore. 



CENTROLOPHID^. 



*Palinuriclitliys perciformis (Mitchill). (" Rudder Fish.") 



STROMATEID^. 

 *B.hombus triacanthus (Peck). (" Butter Fish." "Butter Scup.") 



These have never been known to take a hook. All the specimens are 

 taken in the pounds, as many as twenty barrels having been obtained 

 in a day. The first taken in 1904 was on May 6, and two the next day. 



PEROIDiE. 

 Perca flavescens (Mitchill). ("Pond Fish." "Perch.") 



Only taken in the fresh-water ponds, and very abundant. 



SERRANID^. 

 Eoccas lineatus (Bloch). ("Striped Bass.") 

 Rarely taken on the scup grounds. 




510 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [May, 



Centropristes striatus (Linnsus). (" Black Bass.") 



In October, 1903, about ten barrels were taken one day from the 

 pounds. Occasionally taken on the scup grounds. 



SPARID^. 



*Stenotomus chrysops (Linnaeus). (" Scup " [abbreviation of Indian word Mishcuppauog].) 



This is an important food fish, and until the introduction of the 

 pounds was only taken by hand-lines. They arrive in these waters 

 about June 1. The first fish are always the largest. Later in the sea- 

 son smaller ones occur. It is said that the first fishing-boat built with 

 a well (in 1763) was first employed in the scup fishery. In the summer 

 of 1903 these fish practically abandoned these waters, a few were 

 taken in the pounds, and the hand-lining was given up. The first 

 (two) were taken in the pound in 1904 on May 8. 



SOIiBNIDiE. 

 ♦Cynoscion regalis (Schneider). (" Squi-dee.") 



Common since the bluefish have become scarce. Occasionally 

 taken trolling, but never, as far as we know, have they been fished for 

 with rods — so commonly practiced in the Jersey waters. Large num- 

 bers taken in the pounds. 



Menticirrhus saxatilis (Sclmeider). (" Whiting.") 



Taken with the mackerel in drift-nets in the spring and are given 

 away, not being very highly esteemed as a food fish. 



LABRID^. 

 Tautogolabrus adspersus (Walbaum). (" Wharf Fish.") 



Fished by boys for cat food. Common about the wharves. 



Tautoga onitis (Linna;us). ("Tautog.") 



Not common. Taken on the scup grounds and in the pounds. 



BALISTID^. 

 ♦Balistes vetula Linnaius. ("Trigger Fish.") 



Taken on the scup grounds. The three secured were taken in the 

 pound in 1903. 



TETRAODONTID^. 



Spheroides maculatus (Schneider). (" Swell-belly.") 



Taken on the scup grounds. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 511 



Mola mola (Linnseus). ("Sun Fish.") 



Rare. Seen in deep water on calm days about the island. One taken 

 some years ago was sent by Dr. Harold Williams to Tuffts College, 

 Massachusetts. 



COTTID^. 

 ♦Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus (Mitchill). ("Sculpin.") 



On scup grounds and in pound. One seen in pound, May 7, 1904. 



OYCLOPTERIDJE. 

 Cyclopterus lumpus Linnaeus. ("Lump Fish.") 



One specimen (8 inches long) taken in the poiind, May 8, 1904, 



TRIGLID^. 

 ♦Prionotus carolinus (Linnaeus). (" Peter Grunter.") 



Common on scup grounds. At times as many as two or three 

 barrels taken in the poimd. Not used as food. The senior writer has 

 often eaten them, and finds them excellent. Seen on May 6, 1904. 



ECHENEIDID^. 

 Echeneis naucrates Linnaeus. (" Sucker.") 



Rare. 



MERLUCCIID^. 

 Merluccius bilinearis (Mitchill). ("Hake.") 



But one adult seen. Taken in the trap October, 1903. In the spring 

 of 1902 the young, about 4 inches in length, were very abundant about 

 the wharves. 



GADID^. 



Polachius virens (Linnaeus). ("Pollock.") 



Caught trolling off east coast. Since the introduction of the pound 

 they have been taken in great numbers. From April 9 to May 5, 

 1904, very nearly 20,000 were taken by the Petrel. 



Gadus callarias Linnaeus. ("Cod.") 



Taken in the spring and fall by hand-lines and line-trawls on the 

 shoals about the island and occasionally in the Sound at Long Hill, 

 Most of those taken by the Petrel Company are sent away, fresh, in ice, 

 some are pickled and others salted and dried. These fish for the 

 last two years have greatly diminished in number. 



Melanogrammus seglefinus (Linnaeus). ("Haddock.") 



Mostly taken in the spring of the year. 




512 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



PLEURONEOTIDiE. 

 Hippoglossus hippoglossus (Linnaeus). (" Halibut.") 



Many years ago regularly fished for off Great Point. In April, 1904, 

 Mr. Bvirchell, while cod-fishing off the east end of the island, caught a 

 halibut on a codfish hook, but lost him. He estimated the fish, which 

 he saw, as weighing about 100 pounds. 



Paralichthys dentatus (Linnaeus). (" Plaice.") 



Very common on the bar in the summer of 1903. 



Paralichthys oblongUS (Mitchill). (" Flounder.") 



Two or three taken in the pound early in i\Iay, 1904. 



Lophopsetta maculata (Mitchill). (" Flat Fish.") 

 Pseudoplenronectes americanus (Walbaum). (" Winter Flounder.") 



Fished for in the harbor in the late fall and early spring. 



LOPHIID^. 



Lophius piscatorius Linnffius. (" Goose Fish." "Monk Fish.") 



About fifty seen at one time in the pound in the fall of 1903, and 

 appeared to average from 50 to 75 pounds apiece.

NOTES ON ORTHOPTERA FROM NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MEXICO. 

 BY JAMES A. G. REHX. 



The following study is based entirely on material in the collection 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The States of 

 Chihuahua, Jalisco, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas are represented 

 in the series of about four hundred specimens studied. The most 

 extensive series is that, comprismg two hundred and sixty-four speci- 

 mens, collected in Jalisco, chiefly at Guadalajara, in 1903, by Mr. J. F. 

 McClendon, and purchased by the Academy. An exceedingly interest- 

 ing collection of seventy-one specimens from San Luis Potosi and 

 Tamaulipas was collected by ]\Ir. ]\L E. Hoag, and this limited series has 

 furnished a surprising number of new and little known forms. Three 

 smaller collections are embraced in this study; a number of Guadala- 

 jara specimens collected and presented by ^Ir. C. H. T. Townsend; a 

 few interesting individuals from Victoria, Tamaulipas, collected by 

 S. N. Rhoads, and a series of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, specimens, 

 collected and presented by Dr. W. E. Hughes.

A study of twenty-two specimens of this species from Tamaulipas,

 writing and presented by him, the m'ale from "Mexique; Simii- 

 chrast," and the female ''Orizaba, reg. temp. Sumichrast," agree with 

 the rather large series studied. As the latter specimens are authori-

This species exhibits a great amount of color and considerable struc- 

 tural variation. The single individual from Tuxpan is almost solid 

 black in color, but no doubt represents this species, as extreme Guada- 

 lajara specimens have the pronotum and head, aside from the yellow 

 lines and borders which are faintly marked in the Tuxpan individual, 

 solid black. The City of Mexico specimen is much more robust than 

 any of the others examined, and may possibly prove to be a distinct 

 species. This form can readily be distinguished from picticornis 

 (Walker) by the orange instead of crimson antennse. This character 

 may be subject to variation, as most the other color characters of the 

 species are, but nevertheless it holds true in the above series, and in 

 eight specimens of picticornis. Good structural characters exist, 

 however, to separate the two forms.

After comparison with Walker's description, I have concluded that 

 these specimens represent his species. They are closely related 

 to T. centurio (Drury), but can be separated by the larger size, shorter 

 wings, which also have the apical third naiTowed, the more produced 

 posterior margin of the pronotum, the greater space between the eyes, 

 and the slenderer posterior limbs.

This specimen belongs to this genus and probably to this species, 

 but several characters are at variance with those given in the 

 brief original description. The lower portion of the lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum as well as the meso- and metapleura of the male 

 are milky- white, while the lower as well as the upper face of the 

 posterior femora of the same sex bear a line of the same color. 

 Anterior and median limbs and external face of the posterior femora 

 of the male are solid French green. The females are almost uniform 

 olivaceous.

One of the male specimens was kindly compared by Mr. A. N. Cau-

 they are probably identical, though some slight differences do exist. 

 The drawing of the genitalia given by Scudder is misleading, as one 

 receives the impression that the subgenital plate is longer in the Vic- 

 toria males, while Mr. Caudell, after comparison with a co-type, states 

 that the reverse is true.

Type: 9 ; Alta :Mira, Tamaulipas, Mexico. June 27, 1903. (M. E. 

 Hoag.) Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 



This new species is quite distinct from any of the pre\aoiisly known 

 species in the genus, and can readily be distinguished hj its large size, 

 very long and powerful posterior limbs and comparatively short o\-i- 

 positor. 



Size very large; form elongate-fusiform. Head with the fastigiiun 

 about as wide as the length of the eye, bluntly roimded, touching the 

 facial process; eye ovate, comparatively small and not prominent; 

 antennae slightly exceeding the body and o^dpositor in length, basal 

 joint flattened inferiorly. Pronotum slightly expanding posteriorly, 

 decidedly prolonged ; sKghtly flattened on the disk, but lateral angles 

 rounded; anterior margin truncate, posterior margin broadly rounded, 

 no carina present; lateral lobes longer than high, the posterior margin 

 slightly emarginate, the inferior margin oblique, the angles obtuse. 

 Prosternum with two suberect slender spines; mesosternum and 

 metasternum acutely lobate. Tegmina or wdngs not apparent. 

 Abdomen moderately compressed, each segment with a slight 

 thickening of the posterior margin on the median line, on the 

 distal segments supplemented by additional hke structiu-es, wliich 

 are arranged in longitudinal series. 0\dpositor slightly ciu^^ed, 

 short, but shghtly longer than the pronotiun and not more than 

 haK the length of the posterior femora, subequal in ^ddth ; the apex 

 very acute, with superior margin straight for a short distance; 

 subgenital plate subtruncate apically. Anterior coxse strongly spined ; 

 femora about equal to the pronotiun in length, two or three spines on 

 the anterior margin, unarmed on the posterior margin; tibiae slightly 

 longer than the femora, bearing three spines on the posterior superior 

 margin. Median coxae unarmed; femora slighth^ longer than the 

 anterior femora, margins unarmed except for the short paired spines on 

 the genicular lobes; tibiae slighth' longer than the femora, anterior 

 superior margin with two spines, posterior superior margin -u-ith four 

 spines, one of which is apical. Posterior femora equal to the body in 

 length, strongly inflated basally, slender apically, internal inferior 

 margin spined except apically; tibiae about equal to the femora, sub- 

 quadrate, the superior margins closeh' and evenly spined. 



General color prout's brown, marked on the dorsmn with vandykc 

 brown and on the lower portion of the lateral lobes and the pleura with 

 wood-brown. Head with the facial portion and the genae suffused 

 with bistre, a faint postocular streak present ; antennae narrowly annu-

 C. niger and C. californianus Scudd., C. stygius (Scudd.), C. agassizii 

 (Scudd.) and C. gracilipes (Hald.). The first of these, viacidatus, may 

 be considered the type. 



Ceuthophilus macropus n. sp. 



Type: 9 ; Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. September 14, 1903. 

 (McClendon.) Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. 



This new species is provisionally placed in Ceuthophilus, but it is 

 possibly distinct, as the median coxae are not spined. It does not 

 appear to be closely related to any of the previously known species, 

 though running to occultiis and discolor in Scudder's key of the genus, 

 to which, however, it is not closely related. 



Size medium; form compressed, elongate-fusiform. Head short and 

 broad; occiput sloping downward and fortv^ard; eye rather small, sub- 

 trigonal ; antennae about twice as long as the body. Pronotum arched 

 transversely; anterior and posterior margins truncate; lateral lobes 

 slightly longer than high, inferior margin very broadly and slightly 

 arcuate, angles rounded. Mesonotum and metanotum subequal in 

 lateral depth, extending below the inferior margin of the lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum. Abdomen compressed, surface smooth. Ovipositor 

 sHghtly longer than the pronotum, straight, tapering evenly from the 

 base to one-third the length from the apex, subequal in the apical 

 third; apex obliquely trimcate, the superior margin with a prominent 

 rounded emargination which gives the extreme apex an almost needle- 

 like character; internal valves bearing five prominent spines on their 

 inferior margins. Anterior coxse unarmed; femora about one-fifth

longer than the pronotum, somewhat compressed, anterior inferior 

 margin with two distal spines, one large and one small, no genicular 

 spine present; tibiae about equal to the femora, unarmed above. 

 Median coxse unarmed ; femora about equal to the anterior femora in 

 length, slenderer, anterior inferior margin armed distally with three 

 or four spines, increasing in size toward the apex, posterior inferior 

 margin with several very small spines on the distal half, genicular 

 spine distinct; tibise slightly longer than the femora, armed on the 

 anterior superior margin with two large and two small spines, posterior 

 margin armed with two or three spines. Posterior femora almost equal 

 to the body in length, moderately inflated, the length about three and 

 a half times the breadth, external inferior margin unarmed, internal 

 inferior margin supplied with a series of small depressed spines, no 

 genicular spine present; tibice straight, exceeding the femora by about 

 one-eighth the length of the latter, armed on the upper surface with 

 four pair of spurs, the smaller spines very uniform and rather stout, 

 median apical spurs equal to the metatarsus in length; second joint of 

 the tarsi about half the length of the metatarsus, third joint of the 

 tarsi slightly more than half the length of the second. 



General color cinnamon, suffused on the upper surface of the abdo- 

 men, thorax and head and the entire anterior limbs except the tarsi 

 with liver brown; antennae cinnamon; posterior femora with, the

This specimen does not fully agree with Saussure's figures and descrip- 

 tion in the Biologia Centr alt- America,^'' as the pronotum is not so elon- 

 gate, though this may be due to sex, as Saussure figured a male and 

 the individual in hand is the other sex. Walker's description is so 

 general that little can be made of it, but the Guadalajara specimen 

 fully agrees with it as well as the structure of the opposite sex and the 

 insufficiency of the diagnosis will allow. This species has been 

 recorded from as far north as Tepic.

Allied to T. cicindeloides, but differing in the very distinctive colora- 

 tion, the larger eyes, the more compressed pronotum and a number of 

 minor characters. No close relationship exists with vittatus Ger- 

 staecker and montanus Saussure, while viridicator Saussure can be 

 readily separated by the coloration. 



C?. — Size medium; appearance cicindeliform as is usual in the genus. 

 Head trigonal, depressed, interocular region flat; eye subelliptical, 

 prominent, in greatest length almost equal to the interocular width. 

 Pronotum deplanate, somewhat constricted mesially, anterior margin 

 truncate with a slight median emargination, posterior margin truncate ; 

 central portion of disk with a distinct longitudinal impressed line which 

 fails to reach either the anterior or posterior margin; lateral lobes of 

 the pronotum with the inferior margin broadly arcuate. Tegmina 

 slightly shorter than the abdomen; axillary veins straighter and less 

 curved than in cicindeloides. Anterior tibiae with the tympanum on 

 the anterior face small and elongate-elliptical. Posterior femora mod- 

 erately inflated, slightly shorter than the tegmina. (The male indi- 

 \ddual has been somewhat crushed and many structural features have 

 been damaged or changed to such an extent as to preclude any mention 

 of them.) 



9 . — Size medium; form as in the male, but slenderer. Head as in 

 the male. Pronotum as in the male except that the posterior portion 

 is not slightly broader than the anterior as in the male, and the median 

 impressed line is less distinct. Tegmina arched, slightly exceeding the 

 apex of the abdomen, subcoriaceous, apex acute; lateral field of the 

 tegmina apically truncato-emarginate and with but three instead of 

 six principal veins as in cicindeloides. Wings with the apical section 

 caudate but not projecting beyond the tegmina. Ovipositor shorter 

 than the posterior femora, moderately arcuate, rather broad and sub- 

 equal in width; superior margin of the apical section with an oblique 

 truncation, apex finely serrulate above and below. Posterior femora 

 about two-thirds as long as the tegmina. 



General color very deep metallic blue in the male, deep metallic

NEW JAPANESE MARINE MOLLTISCA: PELECYPODA. 



BY HEXRY A. PILSBRY. 



The Pelecypods described herein were nearly all received from Mr. 

 Y. Hirase, of Kyoto, Japan. Most of them are from Hirado, Hizen, 

 at the extreme west of Kyushu, where the wide-ranging species of 

 the central Indo-Pacific province rule, and the exclusively Japanese 

 faunal element is less conspicuous than farther north and east. That 

 many new forms are encountered even here but confirms the experi- 

 ence of other recent workers, that in all parts of the Indo-Pacific area 

 there has been great local differentiation. 



In these Proceedings, p. 6, I described a Conns from Ivikai-ga-shima 

 as C. dormitor. My attention has been called by several friends to 

 the prior use of this name for' an Eocene species; and I would there- 

 fore call the Japanese form Conus comatosa. It is probably ancestral 

 to the recent C. sieboldi Rve. 

 Mactra carneopicta n. sp. PL XXXIX, figs, l, 2, 3. 



Shell oval, the beaks slightly in front of the middle; moderately thin, 

 pure white inside; externally profusely painted with flesh-colored 

 rays on a whitish ground, covered with a very thin j^ellow cuticle 

 toward the margins. Anterior and posterior dorsal areas closely and 

 deeply radially sulcate, and the lower part of the anterior half is con- 

 centrically irregularly sulcate; the rest of the smrface being smooth. 

 The pallial sinus is very short and semicircular, the muscle-unpressions 

 and pallial line but faintly marked. The hinge is that of the typical 

 group of Mactra. Length 60, alt. 45, diam. 28.5 mm.

This species resembles M. antiquata Spengl. somewhat, but is not 

 triangular and is white within. It is not unlike some forms of M. 

 stxdtorum in coloration. 

 Spisula (Oxyperas) bernardi n. sp. PI. XXXIX, figs. 4, 5, 6. 



Shell long and narrow, the altitude contained about 1.8 times in 

 the length; somewhat triangular, compressed; moderately solid; the 

 beaks at the anterior two-fifths of the length. Wliite under a closely 

 adherent drab and whitish cuticle, which is irregularly dappled with

purple-brown spots. Sculpture of coarse and irregular concentric 

 wrinkles and sulci, the umbonal region smooth. Interior of a peculiar 

 Isabella tint. Pallial sinus wide and extending to or a trifle beyond 

 the middle of the shell's length. Muscle scars well impressed. Hinge 

 spisuloid, with the bearing faces of the lateral teeth vertically crenu- 

 late. 



Length 58, alt. 32.5, diam. 19 mm. 



Fukura, Awaji. Type No. 86,313, A. X. S. P., from No. 1,561 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Compared with S. aspersa Sowb.,^ this species differs in proportions, 

 being longer and narrower. A specimen of S. aspersa before me meas- 

 ures, length 53, alt. 33, diam. 18.5 mm., the altitude being therefore 

 contained about 1.6 times in the length. The beaks are correctly 

 stated by Reeve to be at the anterior third. The pallial sinus is much 

 longer than in S. hernardi, nearly three-fifths the length of the shell. 

 The lateral teeth are longer in S. hernardi. The external sculpture is 

 conspicuously unlike in the two species. It is named in honor of the 

 late M. Felix Bernard. 



Cytherea crispata arnica n. subsp. PI. XXXIX, 6gs. 10, 11. 



Shell shortly ovate, ventricose, rather thin, the beaks at about the 

 anterior third of its length. Pale buff, marked with three indistinct 

 diverging brown rays, the color confined chiefly to the lamellse, and 

 with some scattered spots, and narrow oblique stripes on each side of 

 the beaks. The beaks are rather full; the lunule cordate and defined 

 by sunken lines; no escutcheon is defined on the right valve, but a 

 depression marks it in the left. The immersed ligament is narrowly 

 lanceolate. The anterior end is rounded, the posterior subtruncate. 

 Sculpture of very numerous rounded radial riblets, wider than their 

 intervals, and undivided throughout. These are crossed by many thin 

 erect concentric lamellae. The upper side of each one is fluted, the 

 ridges corresponding to intervals of the radial riblets, while the lower 

 side is much more deeply fluted, a narrow buttress arising from each 

 radial riblet. The interior is white, the pallial sinus short and ascend- 

 ing, rounded at the end. Muscle impressions and pallial line are very 

 faintly indicated. The anterior and median cardinal teeth are simple 

 and rather slender in the right valve, the posterior tooth deeply bifid. 

 In the left valve the anterior cardinal is simple compressed and high, 

 the middle one wide and deepl}^ bifid, the posterior slender and lamellar. 

 A curved ridge extends from the hinge-plate partly around the anterior

adductor scar, anteriorly. The anterior margin is finely crenulated 

 from the beaks down, and along the basal margin, the posterior end 

 being without internal crenulation. 



Length 51, alt. 43, diam. 32 mm. 



Hirado, Hizen. Type No. 86,299, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,511 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This is a less ponderous species than either Cytherea puerpera or C. 

 reticulata, the radial riblets are more numerous and the concentric 

 lamellse thinner and higher than in either, and quite different in sculp- 

 ture. The hinge and teeth, while of the same type, are decidedly 

 more delicate. I rank the form as a variety of Venus crispata Desh. 

 (P. Z. S., 1853, p. 2, No. 8), but the lamellse of that species are stated 

 to be "in medio et ad margines crassioribus, infiexus," terms hardly 

 applicable to the present species. The description of the interior — 

 "valvis intus in fornice croceis; sinu pallii latissimo, profunda" — is also 

 at variance with the specimens before me. 

 Chione micra n. sp. PI. XLI, figs. 4, 5. 



Shell minute, oval, moderately thick, cream-white, some or all of the 

 ribs stained with light reddish-brown. Beaks small, at about the an- 

 terior third. Lunule cordate, not distinctly defined, escutcheon lanceo- 

 late, slightly excavated. Ligament immersed, short and lanceolate, 

 Sculptiu-e of radial, rounded ribs, 18-20 in number, of which three are 

 on the lunule. The ribs are wider near the anterior end, where several 

 of them are flattened and divided by a median groove, and in the inter- 

 vals of these bifid ribs a minute riblet is interposed near the lower 

 margin. Elsewhere the intervals are about as wide as the ribs. The 

 concentric riblets are low in the intervals, but on the ribs they rise as 

 erect flat scales. The interior is livid-whitish in the ca\-ity, the muscle- 

 impressions, pallial sinus and space below the pallial line being purple- 

 brown, fading to white at the edge. The pallial sinus is short and 

 ascending, roimd at the end. Both ends and the ventral margin are 

 minutely crenulate within, and the margin within the lunule has very 

 fine crenulations nearly parallel to the long axis of the shell. In the 

 left valve the anterior and posterior cardinal teeth are simple, the 

 median one bifid, the posterior tooth being very thin. The right valve 

 has a bifid median cardinal, simple ones on each side, the anterior tooth 

 very thin.

to identify them as the young of any larger species, although I am 

 disposed to believe that it will be found to reach a larger size. The 

 small number of radial riblets is a prominent feature of the sculpture. 

 Venus imhricata Sowerby is a longer species with the lamellae obsolete 

 in the intervals. V. scabra Hanley is unlike in sculpture, but both of 

 these seem related to C. micra. 

 Chione hizenensis n. sp. PI. XLI, figs. 1, 2. 



Shell small, shortly ovate, compressed, yellowish, irregularly macu- 

 late with reddish-brown. Beaks slightly in front of the middle, small 

 and projecting but slightly. Anterior end broadly rounded, posterior 

 end narrower and somewhat tapering. Sculpture of about 42 rounded 

 radial riblets, a little wider than their intervals, becoming very small 

 at the two ends of the series, though they are largest at the anterior 

 end of the shell. The ribs of the anterior half of the shell are divided 

 by a narrow median groove, on the lower half of each rib. These 

 radial riblets are crossed by many regular narrow concentric ridges, 

 higher on the ribs than in the intervals; the whole producing the effect 

 of a tiled roof. The interior is white, usually with a drop-shaped 

 purple-brown streak at one or both ends, and more or less extensive 

 stains of similar tint in the cavity. The pallial sinus is short and 

 rounded. The edge is crenulated in harmony with the riblets along the 

 posterior half of the lower margin, but along the anterior half there 

 are about two denticles to each rib. The two ends are very finely 

 crenulate, and the anterior side of the dorsal margin is crenulate par- 

 allel to the longest axis of the shell, the posterior dorsal margin being 

 smooth. The two obliquely triangular cardinal teeth in the right 

 valve and the short median tooth in the right valve are slightly bifid.

V. costellifera Adams and Reeve (Zool. "Samarang," Moll., p. 79 

 pi. 21, fig. 18) Is a larger, differently colored form from the Philippines, 

 which seems from the description and figure to be closely related, but 

 the scales are stated to be semilunar, while in C. hizenensis they are 

 straight. V. marica differs in sculpture and in the pattern of internal 

 crenulation of the valve margins. 



Pitar sulfurea n. sp. PI. XXXIX, figs. 7, 8, 9. 



The shell is triangular-oval, inflated, solid; pale sulphur- tinted out- 

 side, and distinctly, very finely striate throughout, with some impres- 

 sions indicating former growth-arrests. Beaks full and prominent, 




554 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [J^ly, 



about at the anterior third. Anterior end a little narrower than the 

 posterior, the margin sloping straight to the beak ; the posterior upper 

 margin arcuate. No lunule or escutcheon are defined. The ligament 

 is deeply sunken and narrowly lanceolate. The interior is bright red- 

 dish-ochre colored in the cavity, white outside the pallial line. Valve 

 margins smooth. The hinge is rather broad, the teeth much like those 

 of Pilar citrina Lam. The pallial and muscle scars are but slightly 

 impressed. The pallial sinus small and ascending, extending a little 

 beyond the posterior third of the shell's length.

 Tellina hirasei n. sp. PL XLI, fig. 3. 



,Shell irregularly ovate, compressed, white and thin. Posterior end 

 tapering to a narrowly rounded termination, the anterior end longer 

 and broadly rounded; lower margin strongly arcuate, upper margins 

 nearly straightly sloping, the beaks very small and but slightly pro- 

 jecting. Sculpture of very fine low rounded simple radial riblets, at 

 least twice the width of their narrow interstices, crossed by equally 

 spaced, thin, erect, minutely crimped concentric lamellar threads, about 

 one-half a mm. apart on the middle of the disk of the type specimen. 

 There is a slight radial ridge posteriorly, the surface of the valves being 

 elsewhere regularly convex. Interior wiiite and glossy, very faintly 

 showing a very deep and wide pallial sinus, extending beyond the 

 middle of the shell, and partly confluent with the pallial line below. 

 In the right valve there are two delicate diverging cardinal teeth, 

 the ends overhanging the cavity, and strong, triangularly elevated 

 lateral teeth. The left valve has two cardinal teeth, the anterior one 

 vertical, slightly bifid, the posterior tooth very thin, and parallel to 

 the posterior dorsal slope. On each side the margin is raised into small 

 lameUse fitting above the lateral teeth of the other valve. The liga- 

 ment is narrow and oblique as usual.

 in sculpture. It is apparently referable to the subgenus Pseudarco- 

 pagia of Bertin. It resembles Tellina corbis Bronn in sculptiu-e and 

 to some extent in contour.

Tellina fabrefacta n. sp. PI. XLI, figs. 11, 12. 



Shell oblong, compressed, thin and white; equilateral, the two ends 

 about equally rounded, the upper and basal margins arcuate, the small 

 beaks but slightly projecting, opisthogyrous. Sculpture of coarse 

 concentric ridges nearh' as wide as their intervals, the latter decussated 

 with delicate radial riblets, slightly cuneate in each interval. At the 

 posterior end the ridges are broken up, and in combination with the 

 radii form lozenge-shaped tubercles. The glossy interior shows a very 

 capacious linguiform and ascending pallial sinus, rounded at the end, 

 which extends decidedly past the middle of the valve, its lower margin 

 not confluent with the pallial line. ^In the left valve there is one short, 

 erect cardinal tooth; in the right valve two short, diverging cardinals, 

 and minute anterior and posterior laterals remote from them.

Typical examples of the widespread Codakia (Jagonia) bella Conr. 

 occur in Japan, having been sent from Hirado, Hizen, by Mr. Hirase 

 (No. 1,530 of his register). It has also been reported by Dunker and 

 others as Lucina divergens Phil., a name which Dall has shown to be 

 synonymous. Reeve's Lucina fibula is apparently a composite of 

 two species, but the Oriental form included by him and by Adams 

 and Reeve under that name is doubtless identical with C. hella Conrad. 



Cardium hungerfordi Sowerby. PI. XLI, fig. 17. 



Journal of Malacology, VIII, p. 103 (1901). 

 A figure of this species is given for comparison with the two forms 

 following. All of them occur at Hirado, Hizen, preserving their indi- 

 viduality without intergradation, so far as the material submitted to 

 me shows. All of them are more fragile than C. papyraceum Brug., 

 which has been reported from Japan, but which I have not seen from 

 north of the Philippines. It is not unlikely that the records of Papy- 




556 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



raceum from Japan were based upon specimen? of this species or of 

 C. annce. 



C. hungerfordi is fiesh-colored, either almost uniform or with narrow 

 darker concentric zones alternating with wider pale zones. The 

 shell figured measures, length 10, alt. 9, diam. 6.5 mm. It is from 

 Hirado, Hizen, No. 80.601. A. X. S. P., from Xo. 1,234 of Mr. Hirase's 

 collection. 



Cardium hungerfordi undatopictum n. subsp. PI. XL, figs. 14, 1.5. 



Shell extremely thin, similar in shape to the preceding or with the 

 posterior end longer. Sculpture as in C. hungerfordi. except that very 

 low riblets are visible across the whole valve near the basal margin. 

 Concentrically streaked and profusely marked in zigzag pattern with 

 flesh tint on a whitish ground, the beaks dark. Interior more distinctly 

 marked with waved or zigzag concentric streaks of flesh color or crim- 

 son; radially finely grooved, and the inner margin is distinctly crenu- 

 late in the middle as well as toward the ends.

This form is much larger than C. hungerfordi Sowb. Ill, equaUy thin, 

 but with another pattern of color, much like that of C. annce Pils., 

 from which it differs in sculpture. As in other forms of the group, there 

 is more or less minute roughening of the ends by fine asperities. The 

 marginal crenulation of this form is a feature strongly differentiating 

 it from C. hungerfordi and stigmaticum. 

 Cardium hungerfordi stigmaticum n. subsp. PI. XLI, figs. 1.3, 14. 



This is a small, thin, nearly equilateral white species, with the apex 

 of each valve red-brown, a vertical streak of the same color on the con- 

 vexity of the valve below it, and sometimes some faint stains of the 

 same at the sides. The white interior shows the median streak, with 

 usually side streaks and often some mottling or a streak along the 

 pallial line. The sculpture consists of about 9 rather strong but low 

 rounded ribs on the posterior slope, divided into two sets by a shallow, 

 wide radial valley, the last rib dorsally ha^dng a linear riblet on each 

 side of it. The median portion of the valve is almost smooth, showing 

 the faintest traces of fine riblets near the lower margin ; but where the 

 lower passes into the anterior slope the ribs are decidedly stronger, 

 and denticulate the edge. There is a minute punctulation at both ends 

 in perfectly fresh shells. The right valve has anterior and posterior 

 lateral teeth, the anterior wanting in the other valve.

 in coloration. The latter occurs at Hirado, Hizen. also (1,234 of Mr. 

 Hirase's collection). 

 Cardium annae n. sp. PI. XL, fig. 20. 



Shell subcirciilar and inflated, almost perfectly eciuilateral, thin 

 white, profusely marked with pale flesh-pink zigzag streaks, the beaks 

 fleshy-brown. Sculpture of fine radial riblets at the ends, each scored 

 at the summit with a finely punctiu-ed groove, the grooves persisting 

 over the median portion of the shell where the riblets are obsolete or 

 nearly so. Anteriorly there are about 16 ver\^ regular riblets not ex- 

 tending to the edge above, a lanceolate lunular area being left smooth. 

 Posteriorly the riblets are coarser, less regular, part of them flattened 

 and sulcate down the middle. The riblets scarcely crenulate the mar- 

 gins of the valves. The smoothish median part of the shell is regularly 

 marked with close punctured lines, the spaces between them being 

 perceptibly concave. The interior is slightly fluted by the external 

 ribs at the two ends, nearly smooth elsewhere. The zigzag external 

 markings show rose or crimson on a white ground, which deeper in the 

 cavity changes to fleshy-brown. 



The right valve has two contiguous cardinal teeth, the anterior one 

 standing almost above the posterior, and well developed anterior and 

 posterior lateral teeth. In the left valve the cardinals diverge, the 

 anterior being the larger. The anterior lateral is well developed, the 

 posterior obsolete.

This beautiful Cardium is related to C. papyraceurn Brug., which I 

 have not yet seen from Japan. It is more fragile and more delicately 

 sculptured than that species, in which the inner margins of the valves 

 are closely and deeply fluted. ^Moreover, the altitude of C. papyraceum 

 decidedly exceeds the length, while in C. annce the length is greater. 

 In C. papyraceum the posterior end is more produced than the anterior, 

 the latter being noticeably straightened and subvertical, while in C. 

 anncB the two ends are almost equally rounded. The coloration also 

 differs. 



There is a specimen of this species in the collection of the Academy, 

 received many years ago from Andrew Garrett, labelled " C. tcheliensc

 1861 ; but no mention is made therein of a Cardium tcheliense. I have 

 been unable to trace it in the literature examined. The name suggests 

 that of a pro\ance of northern China, but being orthographically 

 defective, I have thought its retention undesirable. 



Zellia porculus n. sp. PL XLI, figs. IS, 19, 20. 



The small cream-white subglobular shell resembles K. japonica Pils. 

 in outlines, except that it is decidedly more ventricose. The glossy 

 surface is minutely striate, with stronger irregularities at unequal dis- 

 tances indicating periods of gro^-th-arrest. In the right valve there is 

 a single rather broad, oblique cardinal tooth, with a socket and a 

 minute tubercle above it, and a small, triangular lateral. The left 

 valve has two erect, subequal cardinals and a strong, triangular lateral.

 arcuate, the posterior end truncate and biangular, and the anterior 

 end narrowly rounded. Both valves are irregularly sculptured with 

 coarse wTinkles, the convex valve more strongly so. The pallial sinus 

 is small and triangular. In the right valve the anterior lateral tooth 

 is a long, perfectly straight ridge, the posterior tooth is very small and 

 narrow, largely overhung by the concave valve margin. In the left

 Nearly the whole lower valve has been attached. The exterior is 

 gray or with some purple pencilling. Both valves have long, projecting 

 beaks, and are usually about equally concave within. The interior 

 is bluish- white or dirty white, extensively olive-stained, and often 

 with some purple stains. The borders are smooth or nearly so near 

 the hinge, and smooth or finely, irregularly scalloped elsewhere, and 

 the distal and lateral margins are in part or wholly painted with a 

 rather wide border of purple or groups of purple lines. The length of 

 a well-grown shell is 87, breadth 56 mm.

 ventral margin gapes rather widely. The wide ligament-area is marked 

 off into concentric lozenges by very numerous ligament-filled diagonal 

 broadly V-shaped sulci, of which I count 11 in a shell 44 mm. long, 

 17 in one 55 mm. long. The hinge-line is narrow, the teeth fine, close

18, 26 = 44 teeth; length of shell 44 mm. 



15, 30 = 45 teeth; length of shell 53 mm. 



The interior is dirty white, sometimes with brown stains, the edges

 lected by Miss Anna C. Hartshorne (fig. 17), and No. 58,082, received 

 in a lot of shells from northern Japan, probably Yesso, but the exact 

 locality is unknown. 



I take these shells to belong to the species described by Kobelt in 

 his excellent monograph cited above, and referred b}" him with great 

 doubt, and on the authority of Mr. E. A. Smith, to A. ocellata Reeve, 

 described from Singapore. Ha\dng before me topotypes of A. ocellata, 

 as well as several Japanese specimens which agree with them, I am 

 compelled to regard the two species as entirely distinct, and not even 

 closely related, although they agree in general shape. The ligament- 

 area in A. ocellata is smooth, scored by only a few, usually imperfect 

 ligament grooves, there being a large oblique triangle posteriorly and 

 an erect triangle between the beaks free from them. The two oblique 

 triangles marked by grooves are usually covered with a smooth yellow 

 (or in some Japanese shells, blackish) cuticle, while the rest of the 

 area is whitish. This is well shown in the dorsal aspect of a specimen 

 of A. ocellata from the province of Suruga (No. 71,041, A. N. S. P.), 

 drawn in fig. 21 of pi. XL. 



Area ocellata does not attain nearly the size of A. koheltiana, an adult 

 Singapore shell measuring, length 26, alt. 12.5, diam. 13 mm. The 

 Japanese specimens with unworn siu-face are somewhat more regular 

 in growth than those from Singapore, and have a very narrow ven- 

 tral gape. One measures, length 20.5, alt. 11.6, diam. 10.6 mm. The 

 diagonal keel is very acute.

NOTES ON ORTHOPTEKA FEOM ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO AND COLORADO. 



BY JAMES A, G. REHX. 



The specimens mentioned in the following pages are almost all con- 

 tained in the collection of the Academy, and chiefly represent collec- 

 tions made in the summer of 1902 in central Arizona, northern New 

 Mexico and central Colorado by C. F. Oslar, and in the smnmer of 

 1903 by C. R. Biederman, at Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. A 

 few specimens from Yuma county, Arizona, belonging to the Hebard 

 Collection, have also been studied in this connection. 



Family FORFICULID^. 

 Labia melancholica Scudder. 



Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. (C. R. Biederman.) Seven speci- 

 mens of both sexes. 



This species, described from either Waco or near Austin, Texas, has 

 apparently been imre cognized since the original description until the 

 capture of the above-recorded indi\aduals. 



Family BLATTID^ 

 Periplaneta americana (Linnrcus). 



Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. (C. R. Biederman.) Numerous 

 individuals. 



Family MANTID^. 

 Litaneutria minor (Scudder). 



Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. July 26, September 20 and Octo- 

 ber 9, 1903. (C. R. Biederman.) Three males, three females. 



Two of the females show decided traces of a rich vermilion coloration, 

 which apparently suiTused the entire abdomen, thorax and limbs. 

 Stagmomantis Carolina (Liiina;us). 



Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. July 13, 1903. (C. R. Bieder- 

 man.) Two males. 



stagmomantis limbata (Hahn).

 Four females. 

 Bootettix argentatus Bruner.

Chloealtis abdominalis (Thomas). 



Truchas Peak, Rio Arriba county. New ]\Iexico. August 4, 1902. 

 (W. P. Cockerell.) One female. 



Inseparable from a female individual from Manitoba, Canada. 



Horesidotes cinereus Scudder? 



Yimia county, Arizona. September, 1903. One male. Coll. Mor- 

 gan Hebard. 



This specimen probably belongs to this genus and species, but several 

 characters, such as the proportions of the prozona and metazona, do 

 not agree with the description. These parts are said to be "of sub- 

 equal length," while in the specimen at hand the metazona is decidedly 

 shorter than the prozona. Generally, however, the specimen agrees 

 very well with the description. 



Gomphocerus clepsydra Scudder. 



Truchas Peak, Rio AiTiba county, New Mexico. 13,000-14,000 feet 

 elevation and above timber line. August 2, 1902. (W. P. Cockerell.) 

 One male, two females. 



I am not prepared to make any critical remarks on the standing of 

 the several American "species" of this genus, and accordingly the use 

 of clepsydra as a full species should not be considered an expression of 

 opinion, but simply the utiHzation of a term to designate a type the 

 validity of which is, to say the least, doubtful. 



Boopedon nubilum (Say). 



Thumb Butte, Arizona. July 11, 1902. (Oslar.) One male. 



Lignrotettix Kunzei Caudell.

I cannot agree with CaudelP in uniting A. teporata with this species. 

 They appear to me quite distinct, and separable by the length of the 

 tegmina and ^^dngs in the female, and in the form of the vertex. In 

 this connection I have examined thirty-seven specimens of the two 

 species.

Allied to A. nietana Saussure, but differing in the slenderer form, the 

 narrower vertex, the more vertical face, the longer metazona and the 

 slenderer posterior femora. 



d". — Size medium; form somewhat slender. Head with the occiput 

 bearing several longitudinal rugse, the median one extending forw-ard 

 to the tip of the scutellum of the vertex; scutellum pyriform, longer 

 than broad, very slightly excavated, margins moderately high, the 

 median carina broken centrally; lateral foveolae elongate, subtrigonal, 

 not strongly marked; frontal costa broad and subequal interiorly, at 

 the ocellus expanded and slightly and shallowly excavated, above the 

 ocellus distinctly coixstricted, subequal, apex truncate, this portion 

 with a distinct median carina; e5'e not prominent and about equal in 

 length to the intraocular portion of the genae; antennae about equal 

 to the head and pronotum in length. Pronotmn with the median 

 carina rather low, even, distinctly cut by the last sulcus; anterior 

 margin very obtuse-angulate ; posterior margin acute-angulate with 

 the angle rounded ; siuf ace of the disk rugoso-granulate ; lateral lobes 

 of the pronotum subequal, deeper than wide. Interval between the 

 metasternal lobes slightly longer than broad. Tegmina moderately 

 long; apex obliquely truncate; greatest width about median. Wings 

 not elongate, two-thirds as wide as long. Posterior femora robust, 

 reaching to the apex of the abdomen, superior and inferior margins 

 equally arcuate.

distinctly silicate below the ocellus; antennse somewhat shorter than 

 the head and pronotum. Median carina of the pronotum lower than in 

 the male; posterior margin of the pronotum rectangulate with the 

 apex rounded. Intervals between the metastcrnal lobes very slightly 

 broader than long. 



General color blackish-brown, sprinkled with small obscure blackish 

 maculations. Abdomen and under surface dull yellowish in the male, 

 var\dng from yello^uish-brown to dark wood-brown in the females, and 

 the paler specimens of the latter sex have the abdomen with regular 

 lateral blotches of brownish-black. Tegmina of the general color. 

 Wings with the disk flame-scarlet, the fuscous bar rather dark but 

 fading on the posterior margin of the wing ; apex suffused with fuscous ; 

 tsenia rather broad, solid, but not reaching the base of the wing; costal 

 margin of the color of the disk. Posterior femora externally with 

 traces of several transverse dark bars, the apical one of which is fairly 

 apparent and somewhat contrasts a weak pregenicular annulus of 

 ochraceous; genicular region blackish; internal face with the pre- 

 genicular annulus yellowish and distinct, the remainder black with 

 the superior and inferior margin^ cut by two broken bars of yellowish. 

 Posterior tibiae greenish-yellow (6^) or dull brown, dark apically; 

 spines tipped with black.

 Silver Lake, Utah [Skinner] (two males); Albuquerque, New Mexico 

 [Oslar] (two females); Jerome, Arizona [Oslar] (three males and two 

 females). The most striking variation exhibited by the series is in 

 color, size being quite constant. The ground color in some individuals 

 is almost uniform, in others strongly maculate, while several have the 

 posterior margin and the entire lateral lobes of the pronotum conspicu- 

 ously barred with the two primary shades. In several specimens the

Allied to T. agrestis McNeill, but differing in the longer wings and 

 tegmina, the weaker lateral fastigial carina and the darker coloration. 



Size rather large. Head with the interspace between the eyes 

 moderately broad; scutellum of the vertex slightly longer than broad, 

 but slightly excavated and without a median carina; lateral foveolse 

 minute, subtrigonal; frontal costa not reaching the clypeus, faintly 

 expanded inferiorly, superior portion subequal, all moderately sulcate ; 

 eye moderately prominent, rather small, decidedly less than the infra-

Mr. Caudell has compared these specimens with U. S. National

 the structure of the cerci are not as in that species.

This species is exceedingly variable in coloration and slightly so 

 in structure. The typical form of Scudder is represented more or less 

 closely by five of the specimens in the collection, but the two adult

T>T3e: cJ* ; Florence, Pinal county, Arizona. 1903. (C. R. Bieder-

This specimen is unquestionably a member of the Palearctic genus 

 Drymadusa, and is closest related to D. limbata Brunner,^ from Asia 

 Minor, but is easily separated by the much smaller size and slenderer 

 tegmina, as w^ell as the more apparent maculations of the same. 



Size rather large; form considerably elongate. Head with the 

 occiput rounded transversely, not elevated sloping gradually to the 

 rather narrow, partially sulcate fastigium, which latter is deflected 

 and touches the frontal process, width of the fastigium less than that 

 of the first antennal joint; eyes wide apart, prominent, subglobose; 

 antennae as long as the tegmina. Pronotiun selliform; anterior mar- 

 gin shallowly emarginate, posterior margin broadly and evenly rotun- 

 date; lateral lobes with the inferior margin rather narrowly rounded; 

 posterior sinus very slight. Tegmina elongate, exceeding the apex of 

 the abdomen by half their length, the greatest width is contained six 

 and a half times in the length, apex obliquely truncato-rotundate, 

 costal expansion regular but not marked, greatest basally and narrowing 

 gradually toward the apex. Wings equal to the tegmina in length. 

 Abdomen somewhat compressed; supra-anal plate triangular, deeply 

 and very narrowly divided into two elongate acute lobes ; cerci rather 

 short, the apical portion with two distinct hooks on the internal face; 

 subgenital plate compressed, deep, inferiorly carinate, apical margin 

 triangularly incised. Anterior femora longer than the pronotum,

internal inferior margin with three to four \ery distinct spines; tibise 

 "v^-ith two spines on the external superior margin. Median femora 

 slightly longer than the anterior, external inferior margin with one or 

 two spines; tibise with two spines on the external superior margin and 

 three internal superior margin. Posterior femora slightly shorter 

 than the head and body, apical half slender and subequal, basal half 

 moderately expanded; tibiae slightly longer than the femora, com- 

 pressed quadrate in section, regularly spined above, except basally, 

 where the spines are fewer, inferior face with seven pairs of spines and 

 several odd ones, upper inner calcar much exceeding the external in 

 size; posterior tarsi of the type usual in the genus. 



General color ochraceous buff (probably greenish in life) washed with 

 apple-green on the tegmina. Head darker above than below; eyes 

 hazel. Pronotum with an hour-glass-shaped figure on the median 

 portion of the disk and a line along the posterior portion of the lateral 

 lobes approximately parallel to the margin blackish-brown; posterior 

 margin of the disk of the pronotiun broadly bone-white. Tegmina 

 with a distinct median longitudinal series of subcircular opaque whitish 

 spots, flanked above by a short series not so distinct, a few poorly de- 

 fined blotches along the anal margin and an irregular jumbled series 

 in the costal field.

ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS FROM MOUNT SANHEDRIN, 

 CALIFORNIA. 



BY WITMER STONE. 



CWiTH Field Xotes by A. S. Bunnell.) 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has recently se- 

 cured a valuable collection of Calif ornian birds and mammals, formerly 

 the property of Mr. A. S. Bunnell, of Berkeley. j\Ir, Bunnell collected 

 most of his specimens in the neighborhood of Berkeley and about Mount 

 Tallac in the Sierras, both of which localities have received considerable 

 study of late years, especially with regard to their a\'if auna. The most 

 interesting portion of the collection, however, comes from Mount Sanhe- 

 drin, in Mendocino county, and as practically nothing has been pub- 

 lished upon the fauna of this region, it seems desirable to present the 

 results of Mr. Bunnell's work. In reply to my request for informa- 

 tion as to the nature of the country, he has very kindly fm-nished me 

 with the follomng account, which I quote in full. 



"I was located at Lierlie's ranch, 2,100 feet elevation, which is a 

 cluster of cottages on the north side of a range of spruce-covered hills 

 that rise from Thomas creek, a tributary of Eel river. On the opposite 

 side of this creek from the ranch rises Mount Sanhedrin, which attains 

 an elevation of about 5,000 feet. The whole country is covered with 

 Douglass Spruce and Bull Pine forests on the north sides of the hills, 

 with a few cedars in the shady parts. In more level places there are 

 madronos and black oaks, and on exposed sunny slopes either manza- 

 nita and other brush or else grassy clearings. Where the forests are 

 not deep there is much underbrush, and along Thomas creek are alders 

 and willows. The creek is a wild trout stream about twenty feet in 

 wTidth, tumbling throughout its length, while Eel river is about thirty 

 yards wide. There is an abundance of water, although the region lies 

 east of the humid coast belt, and there are no redwoods to be found. 



"The ranch is in the transition zone, apparently nearly on the bound- 

 ary, as one can hear at the same time the songs of the Russet-back and 

 Dwarf Hermit Thrushes and the calls of the Valley Quail and Fliuned 

 Partridge. Mount Sanhedrin runs up into the Hudsonian, and on its 

 top, where the snow disappears in May, are found the Thick-biUed 

 Sparrow, Golden-crowned Kinglet and Mountain Chickadee. The top 




1904,] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 577 



of the mountain is mostly covered with low snow-crushed spiny brush, 

 while Wliite-barked Firs grow on the north side." 



The specimens were collected on two trips made in 1S97 and 1899. 

 during the months of May, June and July. 



MAMMALS. 



Twenty-one species of mammals were secured by JMr. Bunnell, 

 and eleven others are reported by him as occiu-ring in the vicinity. For 

 the identification of the bats I am indebted to Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, while 

 Mr. W. H. Osgood has kindly examined several of the other species and 

 compared them with specimens in the collection of the U. S. Biological 

 Survey. Species reported by Mr. Bunnell but not represented in the 

 series are marked with an asterisk. 



Citellus grammurus douglasii (Richardson). Columbian SpermophUe. 



Two males. June 11 and July 14. Central shoulder patch jet black, 

 and sides very bright silvery gray. 



Eutamias hindsi (Gray). Hinds' Chipmunk. 



A male and female, j\Iay 30 and June 28, are in the dull pelage, but 

 another pair secured July 8 have patches of bright rusty hairs cropping 

 out on the back and sides. 



Sciurus douglasii albolimbatus Allen. Sierran Chickaree. 



One female example. June 30, which seems absolutely identical with 

 central Sierra specimens and shows no tendency toward 7noU)'pUosus 

 of the redwood belt. 



Sciurus griseus Ord. Oregon Gray Squirrel. 



Six specimens, June 1 to July 24. 

 Reithrodontomys longicauda (Baird). 



One specimen, a female, June 11. Measurements as follows: Length 

 115 mm., tail 37 (partly lost), hind foot 19, car 15. Apparently identi- 

 cal with Berkeley specimens. 



Peromyscus gambelii (Baird). White-footed Mouse. 



Represented by a full series of specimens. 



Peromyscus truei (Shufeldi). Big-eared Mouse. 



Four adults in tawny pelage, May 29 to June 14; two probably 

 younger, June 13 and 14, much less tawny, and five young, ^lay 29- 

 June 14, in mouse gray pelage, some of them with buff patches on the 

 sides, showing the molt into the preceding stage. 



I was at first inclined to think that some of these were P. boylii, but 

 comparison with specimens of the latter, kindly loaned by ^Ir. D. G. 

 37 




578 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



Elliot from the collection of the Field Columbian Museum, convinces 

 me that they all belong to the present species. 



Neotoma fuscipes Baird. Round-tailed Wood Rat. 



Two adults and two young, June 13-15. These seem identical with 

 Berkeley specimens, and it is noticeable that one from each locality has 

 a partly bicolor tail. In this and other respects this rat seems subject 

 to much individual variation, and I cannot but think that some of the 

 recently established forms which do not seem to have any distinctive 

 geographic range will prove to have been based upon imstable charac- 

 ters. 



Microtus californicus (Peale). California Vole. 



One specimen, identical with those from Berkeley. 



Phenacomys longicaudus True. 



One female example of this rare mouse was found dead in a road, 

 June 30, 1899 (No. 11,625, Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.). The occur- 

 rence of this species so far south of its previously known habitat in 

 Oregon is of particular interest, apart from the fact that this is, so far 

 as I am aware, only the third specimen that has been secured.^ 



In color this specimen is pale rusty, with an admixture of grayish- 

 white hairs, especially about the head and shoulders, and with long 

 rather inconspicuous black hairs scattered over the whole upper surface, 

 beneath gra3dsh-white with the plumbeous bases of the bans showing 

 through, feet pale rusty above, grayish-white below, tail dark brown 

 with a mixture of silvery white hairs below which make it appear 

 indistinctly bicolor. 



Length 170 mm., tail 70, hind foot 19. 



The skull resembles that of P. preblei (the only one available for com-

BIRDS. 



The collection of biixls contains representatives of fifty-six species. 

 all of which, from the time of captm'e, may be regarded as breeding. 

 To these Mr. Bunnell has added thirty-three species observed, but not 

 secured. These are marked with an asterisk. The collection has been 

 carefully identified with reference to subspecific differences, as the 

 locality is to some extent on the borderland of the humid coast, the 

 Sierran and the Upper Sonoran faimas. The field notes are entirely 

 from Mr. Bunnell's journal.

Numerous on oaks and spruces. The specimens approach harrisii, 

 but are nearer to hyloscopus. 

 Dryobates pubescens tvirati (Malherbe). Willow Woodpecker. 



Numerous. Two specimens obtained show a decided tendency 

 toward gairdneri. In one the tertials are unspotted, in the other those 

 of one side are spotted, while those of the other arc not. The supercili- 

 ary stripe and back are pure white. 



Sphyrapicus ruber (Gmel.). Eed-breasted Sapsucker. 



]\Iore common on the higher ridges. The only specimen obtained 

 is typical. 



Ceopbloeus pileatus abieticola Bangs. Northern Pileated Woodpecker. 



Not common. The specimen obtained is small, perhaps indicating 

 a diminution in size, such as we find in the Southern States on the 

 Atlantic coast. It is a female and measures wing 8.75 ins., culmen 

 2 ins. A female from Vernon. B. C, shows wing 9.20, culmen 2.25,

 Aphelocoma californica (Vig). California Jay. 



Fairly numerous. 

 Cyanooitta stelleri carbonacea Grinnell. Coast Jay. 



Range overlaps that of the preceding. All the specimens are very 

 brown on the back, but I attribute this to the wear of the plumage. 

 Altogether the specimens are nearest to carbonacea, though they ex- 

 hibit much variation in the development of the frontal spots. In one 

 they are barely appreciable, in two moderately developed and blue, 

 while in one they are strongly developed and tipped with white.

NOTES ON A COLLECTION OF CALIFORNIAN MAMMALS. 



BY WITMER STOXE. 



The following list of mammals, obtained by Mr. A. S, Bunnell in the 

 neighborhood of Berkeley and in the Sierras, and now forming part of 

 the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, is 

 published as a contribution toward our knowledge of the distribution 

 of the various species and subspecies. The bats have been studied and 

 identified by Mr. J. A. G. Rehn. 



Berkeley Collectiox. 



Citellus grammums beecheyi (Rich.). 

 A series from Berkeley. 



Neotoma fuscipes Baird. 



A number of specimens from Berkeley; two have partly bicolor 

 tails and the color of the adults varies considerably, some being 

 much redder than others. In view of this individual variation it 

 would seem that the A^. fuscipes affinis of Elliot and probably some of 

 the other races recently proposed will, with A', monochroura of Rhoads, 

 be eventually relegated to synonymy. 



Peromyscus gambelii (Baird;. 



A series from Berkeley. 

 Peromyscus californicus (.Gambel). 



A number from Berkeley. Through the kindness of Mr. D. G. Elliot 

 I have received from the Field Columbian ]\Iuseum topotypes of his 

 P. dyselius and certain other specimens, including P. hoijlii, for compari- 

 son with the above series. The result is that I find in the Berkeley 

 lot typical specimens of both P. californicus and dyselius and others 

 that appear to be equally referable to either, and my conclusion is 

 that the latter form is based upon younger or smaller examples of 

 californicus. Rhoads' P. major is likewise a synonym of californicus, 

 as shown conclusively by a comparison of the types in the Academy 

 collection. Mr. Bunnell got no specimeas of P. boylii at Berkeley — 

 that is, none of the form so identified by Mr. Elliot {Field Col. Mus. 

 Puhl, Zool. Ser., I, No. 10, p. 206).

 longer than in the Eastern cynocephalus, and differ appreciably in 

 color, though the latter is rather uncertain as few skins of cynocephalus 

 are available for comparison. A skin of cynocephalus appears decidedly 

 brownish when compared with californicus; the upper parts are mummy 

 brown against seal brown with a grayish suffusion in californicus, the 

 under parts are raw umber compared with sepia suffused with ashy 

 gray in californicus. 



The relationship with A'', mexicanus (Saussure) it is not possible to 

 ascertain, as too little material is available.

r^??e.— Mount Tallac, California, c^. July 10, 1898. No. 11,685, 

 Coll. Acad. Nat. Sci. PhUa. Collected by A. S. Bunnell. 



General Characters. — Similar to E. fuscus osceola Rhoads in size and 

 cranial characters, but diifering in the darker upper surface, the grayer 

 under parts and the blacker membranes. From fuscus it may immedi- 

 ately be differentiated by the more reddish-brown upper surface and 

 less silvery under parts. 



Distribution. — Specimens from the type locality only have been 

 examined. 



Size. — In general proportions fuscus, f. osceola and /. melano'pterus 

 seem almost identical. The average of five specimens of each shows 

 that /. melanopterus has the forearm averaging almost three milli- 

 meters longer than in fuscus, while osceola is considerably smaller than 

 the former, and very slightly less than the latter. 



Color. — Above rather dark cinnamon, lightest on the top of the head 

 and at the shoulders. Under surface reddish wood brown. Mem- 

 branes and face deep blackish. In true fuscus the upper siu-face is 

 drab, below pale Isabella color. In fuscus osceola the upper parts are 

 much the same tint as in melanopterus, but not as rich in tone, w^hile 

 the under parts are more of a j-ellowish-brown, and not as ashy in tint. 

 The membranes of fuscus osceola are much paler in coloration than in 

 melanopterus. 



Skull. — Identical with the typical form. 



Teeth. — The last upper molar in melanopterus appears to be broader 

 than in fuscus or /. osceola. Otheru'ise the dental series seem to be 

 identical. 



Remarks. — The form from Mount Tallac is no doubt closest related 

 to /. osceola than any of the form of fuscus. The original series of the 

 former has been examined in this connection, and the differential 

 characters were drawn from it. The relatioiLship with true fuscus 

 is not so close as an examination of a series of thirty specimens from, or 

 within a radius of, twenty miles of the type locality shows. No close 

 relationship exists with E. /. bernardinus Rhoads, which is a very 

 pale type quite different from any of the forms here considered. From 

 /. osceola the new form may be easily distinguished by the richer 

 color of the upper parts and the more smoky under surface, as well 

 as the more blackish membranes.

 does not seem to have been noticed by Miller (North Amer. Fauna, No. 

 13, pp. 110-111) in summarizing the differential characters of the race.

ON CERTAIN RHACHIGLOSSATE GASTROPODA ELIMINATED FROM THE 

 AQUILLID^. 



BY H. A. PILSBRY AXD E. G. VAXATTA. 



Among the smaller species described by the older authors as "Tri- 

 tons," and referred by Tr3^on and others to the subgenus Ejpidromus, 

 there exists some diversity in shell characters, and a much greater 

 difference in the soft anatom3^ Morch many years ago eliminated 

 his ^Miu-icid genus Aspella from this assemblage, and Kesteven, in an 

 able and interesting paper, has recently shown an Australian species, 

 Triton speciosus Angas, to belong to Trophon, figuring its operculum 

 and teeth. ^ 



Another ^luricid genus is represented bj'' Triton bradeatus Hinds, 

 and its allies, characteristic and widespread littoral Potynesian species. 

 This group may be called 



MACULOTRITON Dall.^ 



The shell is acuminate-oblong, longitudinally plicate and spirally 

 tuberculate-lirate,with a smooth trochoidal nucleus of about 3^ whorls. 

 Aperture ovate, the outer lip thick, dentate within, and strengthened 

 by a rounded varix outside, another varix often developed opposite 

 it on the last whorl. Anterior canal open, very short. A small pos- 

 terior sinus is defined by a low callous on the parietal wall. Opercu- 

 lum with basal nucleus. 



1 Proc. Linn. Soc. N. S. Wales for 1902, p. 479, fig. 3. 



^ In a paper issued last February, one of the present authors suggested that 

 Colubraria Schum., which had always been associated vdth the Tsenioglossate 

 Triton, might prove to be Rhachiglossate,. and remarked that "a series of Aa- 

 tillean and Pacific species referred to this division. by Tryon and otliers, of 

 whicli decapitatus Reeve and bracteatus Hinds are tj-pical, belongs to the Rhachi- 

 glossa, as Mr. A'anatta and the T\Titer will elsewhere show." In a paper on 

 the Tritons and Frog-shells just issued, Prof. W. H. Dall adopts but does not 

 define a family Colubrariidce to include Colubraria, the groups we had indicated 

 as Rhachiglossate, and one or two others. He anticipates the appearance of 

 the data promised by us, by giving names to the groups we had indicated as 

 Rhachiglossate. It remains, tlaerefore, for us to substitute in our proof-sheets 

 the names given by Dall for those we had written, and to expose the true char- 

 acters and family relationships of the gastropods in question. 



As to the "Family Colubrariidce," the tj^pical genus Colubraria is as yet known 

 by the shell alone. The other groups referred to it by Dall, of which the dentition 

 is' known, belong without any doubt to the Muricidce and Buccinidce. Is science 

 advanced by the formation of family groups upon such grounds?

The radula is ]\Iuricokl, the rhachiclian tooth very wide, straight, 

 with a long curved central cusp inserted far forward, and on each 

 side there are two adjacent side cusps, the outer ones larger. Lateral 

 teeth with a single slender cusp. 



Type, M. bractcatus (Hinds). 



The shell in this genus has unich llic apix-ar- 

 ance of the Buccinoid Tritonidca. 



Maculotriton differs from Occnehra (type criiiti- 

 cea L.) in the form of the central teeth of the 

 radula, which in Ocenehra have a very character- 

 istic structure. The dentition in our new genus 

 agrees with that of Trophon dathratus as figured by 

 Troschel f but the conchological characters of these 

 Indo-Pacific snails bar their entrance into Trophon

BUCCINID^. 



Another series of species, formerly placed in Triton, proves to belong 

 to the Pisania-Tritonidea group of Buccinidce; and for them a new sub- 

 genus of Tritonidea may be erected. 



CADUCIFER Dall. 



The shell in this group resembles that of Tritonidea in sculpture 

 and characters of the aperture, but it is more slender than in that 

 genus. The teeth resemble those of Euthria lineata as figured by 

 Troschel. The teeth of the central row have a group of three cusps 

 springing from a short, arcuate basal-plate. The laterals have large 

 curved cusps at the outer and inner margins, with a smaller intermedi- 

 ate cusp near the inner one.

 be found to belong here. Some of the species lose their early whorls

VAKIABIIITY AND AUTOTOMY OF PHATARIA. 



BY SARAH P. MONKS. 



Phataria (Linckia) unifascialis Gray, var. bifascialis is a starfish 

 that is remarkable for the variabihty in the size and number of its 

 rays. Regularity is the exception. In over 400 specimens examined 

 not more than four were symmetrical and no two were alike. Fig. 

 13, PI. XLII, is a nearly symmetrical six-rayed star, but one of its 

 rays has been broken off and renewed. 



The plate shows the great variability in size of stars, number of rays 

 and different breaking places. 



The animals vary in size from four to seventeen centimeters. This 

 difference may in some measure be due to age. but there is evidently 

 also considerable difference in size in adult specimens. 



The normal number of rays is five, but some specimens have only 

 one, while others have four, six, seven, or even nine; four, five or six 

 being most common numbers. Of 248 specimens examined 29 had 

 one ray, 34 four rays, 135 five rays, 44 six rays, 5 seven rays and 1 

 nine rays. 



There is a marked irregularity in the size of the rays, for the l)reaking 

 and renewing occur at all ages, or, at least, at all sizes. Single 

 living rays without any external sign of disk are not uncommon. 

 Twenty-two in a lot of 240 were single. In animals measured the ra3's 

 varied in length from 22-75 mm., and were in all conditions, from speci- 

 mens which showed by the raw surface that the breakage was recent, 

 through all grades of healing surfaces to stars where new rays appeared 

 as mere buds, to the comet series and to the various rays of adult 

 Phataria^. 



Comets are frequently found; tlici-e woj-e forty-one of tlicni in 240 

 specimens. These arc stars with one long ray and a number of small 

 rays extending from a mimite disk. They are rays that have made a 

 new body. In PI. XLII, 3-11 are comets. The long ray is from 

 2-7 cent, in length. On account of their small size the single rays and 

 comets are more easily overlooked by collectors. 



This species of Phataria is mottled red(lisli-})ro\v]i and ash color, with 

 the ti])s of tlie rays and the small lunv I'ays, oi' new portion of thr I'ay, 




1004.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHTLADELPHIA. 597 



a brighter and uniform red. It is easy to distinguish new parts by 

 this growth "color/' even when the line of breakage is obliterated. 



From the great discrepancy in the size of the rays it follows that one 

 , or two rays may be sexually mature, while others are small or even 

 buds. In two individuals sexually mature August 4, 1901, the meas- 

 urements of rays show: o^ , 77.70.58.20 mm.; ? , 70.65.52.13 mm. 



This species generally has two or more madreporites and two or 

 more ani. 



There is a great difference in the size of the madreporic body and 

 frequently, but not always, it is larger in large specimens. In 174 

 specimens 6 had one, 154 had two, 11 had three, 2 had four and 1 

 had five madreporites. 



The ani are only visible in live animals. In fiS specimens 15 had 

 one, 48 had two, 3 had three, 1 had four ani. 



There may be some connection, as has been suggested, between 

 madreporites and breaking plane, but I have failed to find anything 

 satisfactory on the subject. Sometimes the largest ray, or a large ray, 

 is between two madreporic bodies. In 132 specimens 87 long arms 

 and 45 short arms were between the madreporites. 



There is a further irregularity in this species in the place from which 

 the reproductive material finds exit. Usually in asteroids it comes 

 from the angle between rays, but in Phataria the sperm and ova may 

 come from any part of the inner two-thirds of a ra3^ 



I have also found this year (August, ] 904) that a Phataria may have 

 two mouths. In fig. 22 there is a mouth at each meeting point (A and 

 B) of the ambulacral furrows. In No. 11 there are also indications 

 of two mouths, and in another speciuKMi I have, l)ut owing to the 

 rareness of tlic ])ccii]i:iiity 1 have not. wished as yrt to destroy these 

 two specimens in order to prove the snrmise. 



The want of symmetry in this Phataria suggests tlu^ belief that the 

 ability to break and regenerate is greater in this species tlian in ordi- 

 nary Asteroidea, and that it is a connnon factor in the life of the species. 

 Most starfish can lose their rays and make new ones, lint it is a gener- 

 ally accepted opinion among zoologists that a ray cannot make a new 

 body unless some portion of the disk is pn^sent. In P. I)ifascialis (Ir. 

 there is a suggestion that a ray can j-egenerate a body, although the 

 evidence is inconclusive. The suggestion is seen in tlie sei'ies of figs. 

 1-11 in the plate. ^ 



' Since writing the above in 1901 I liave been fortunate in a series of experi- 

 ments extending to the present time, August, 1904, in having a number of single 

 rays, cut at various places, regenerate the disk and other rays. I cut off rays, 

 and in that way tlie stroteliing of tlie pyloric cicca and the consequent loss of 




598 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Aug., 



This suggestion springs from various facts: The extent of the 

 "growth color" in comets, the apparent absence of disk in single rays, 

 and the constant place of breaking in the pyloric caeca. 



The breaking place in the skeleton may occur near the disk, from 

 0-12 mm. from the angle of the ray, or at almost any point on the ray. 

 I have never seen a break that was decidedly inside the disk. 



In 18 specimens with 26 regenerating rays, 4 were less than 3 nun., 

 20 were from 3-6 mm., and 2 were 35 and 45 mm. from angle. 



The cause of breaking is obscure. Unlike Ophiurians they are 

 exceedingly tough. At touch Phataria becomes hard, tough and 

 rigid, and when it is thus contracted it requires considerable strength 

 to pull it asunder, and it is a difficult matter even to cut among tlie 

 ossicles. 



If any external force l^cars a part in breaking the animal it is prol)- 

 able that the creature is surprised when limp and relaxed, but I am 

 inclined to think that Phataria always breaks itself, no matter 

 what may be the impulse. They may break when conditions arc 

 changed, sometimes within a few hours after being placed in jars, 

 or a few days, or even not for months. Some never break, but stand 

 all kinds of inconvenience of heat and cold and stagnant water. 



There is no season for the breaking, for they are found newly broken 

 in the sea in all seasons of the year. The sensitiveness of this species 

 to om- cold spells in winter and hot spells in summer has put an end 

 to many promising experiments. Whatever may be the stimulus the 

 animal can and does break of itself. 



During the years 1901-04 I have watched more than fifty starfish 

 disunite. Tliere is a regularity about the matter that indicates that 

 the breaking is not an accident, or the fancy of a day, but a habit of 

 the species. The breaking is automatic. Experiment confirms the 

 inference that naturally arises on seeing a large number of specimens 

 together that the irregularity is due to an inherent character of this 

 species of Phataria. The process is deliberate. It is not a breaking in 

 the proper sense of the word, but a drawing or pulling asunder. It 

 requires from half an hour to three or four hours, vdth. resting spells, 

 and the motions are perceptible. 



The ordinary method is for the main portion of the starfish to remain 

 fixed and passive with the tube feet set on the side opposite the 

 departing ray, and for this ray to walk slowly away at right angles to 



time for its wdthdrawal were avoided and after a number of months the ray had 

 reached the comet stage. In one case two arms started to grow from the place 

 from which one had been cut. The photograph and statement of facts appeared 

 in Froc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., May, 1904. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 599 



the body, to change position, twist, and do all the active labor neces- 

 sary to the breakage. If there are more rays than are needed to resist 

 the pulling arm they take a negative part and position. Frequently 

 they hang limp with their ambulacrse withdrawn. 



There seems to be the same coordination in this work as in the walk- 

 ing of Asteroidea, for in the six or eight positions taken during the 

 severing of a ray the larger portion of the star always keeps pulling in 

 a direction opposite that of the parting ray, and not in any, or all, of 

 the four, five or six directions of radiation. 



The skeleton breaks in one of two ways. In one way the ray swells 

 about its midpoint and grows smaller at its proximal portion as it 

 pulls away from the body. In the region of strain the ossicles become 

 separated for a space of about 25 mm., so that the white connective 

 and muscular tissues shine between them till finally, just before part- 

 ing, they stand out like beads on a network of shiny white floss. There 

 is much more elasticity in the animal at this time than would scorn 

 possible in a starfish. 



Immediately after the break the ossicles recover their com[)act 

 position and the two parted edges show a more or less jagged surface. 

 This way is rapid, the body wall being pulled apart in from three to 

 thirty minutes after the arm becomes narrowed. 



In the other way of breaking only a small area is affected by the 

 strain, and the breaking place shows from the first as a fracture. There 

 is no narrowing of the ray, no strained surface and no gradual separa- 

 tion of ossicles. A small opening, something like a crack, appears on 

 the dorsal side of the ray, and this increases with an uneven edge till 

 the body wall is parted around the entire ray. The first visible evi- 

 dence of this kind of division is, either the ray is in a strained position 

 opposite the body or it lops over and hangs limp, letting its weight act 

 as the pulling power. The invariable method in Phataria I ha\'e 

 watched, after the body wall breaks, is: The arm walks away; th(; 

 pyloric cjeca are pulled out of the arm, sometimes for 83 nun., and 

 kept very tense ; then a break occurs in the tube connecting the pyloric 

 cajca with the stomach ; the pyloric caca arc withdrawn into the arm and 

 the small portion of the tube into the body and the arm is free. TIk; 

 parting of the soft tissues is not abrupt, is accomplislicd by sundering 

 strands thread by thread. The pyloric ca;ca and tube arc wonderfully 

 elastic. Sometimes the tube is stretched till it appears as the finest 

 thread. 



After breaking the pyloric cseca coil up, and as they are retracted to 

 their ordinary position an occasional spasmodic jerk is seen in them. 




0(J0 PROCEEDIiVGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



Sometimes th(\y are withdrawn immediately, but friciucntly an arm 

 crawls around for hours, or days, trailing the ca'cum till it is withdrawn 

 or falls away. 



Probably if the c»ca are not taken in within a few hours the nmscles 

 ose their elasticity and the ca?ca decay and drop off. Occasionally 

 these organs arc left on the disk and sometimes the tube is Ijroken in 

 such a manner as to leave them hanging like two coiled trails. Aft(>r 

 freeing itself the ray crawls up the glass and stations itself with tlu; 

 broken part downward and remains so for a long time. This is the 

 attitude of a single ray till all, or nearly all, the pyloric ca;cum assumes 

 its normal position. 



After one arm is separattnl, or even wlien it is going, anotlier may 

 break away. 1 saw onc^ animal try to l)r(^ak {hv disk apart after having 

 lost two rays. It took many positions, strained the tissues and worked 

 for hours, but died before the disk was broken. 



The results of my observations are : The breaking is automatic and is 

 effected by pulling apart or fracture without strain; there is codrdina- 

 tion of parts in producing the separation; the tissues relax at the plane 

 of ruptvu'e; this plane may be near the disk or a variable distance 

 from it on the ray; the pyloric cjEca are always pulled out and nmch 

 stretched; the break of the cscmn occurs at the tube connecting the 

 stomach and glandular portion; the pyloric cacum is generally taken 

 back into the arm; the severed ray may live more than a week, even 

 imder adverse circumstances, without signs of regeneration; and, 

 from my experiments extending over a period of three years, I have 

 found that rays cut various distances from the disk make disks, 

 mouths and new rays in about six montlis.

THE COMPAEATIVE AGE OF THE DIFFERENT FLORISTIC ELEMENTS OF 

 EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



The historic element must be considered in a phytogeographic study 

 of any country. Many questions concerning the present distribution 

 of plants depend upon the character and extent of the past distribu- 

 tion of the species of any region or formation. The degree of invasion 

 of new species into a region is determined by the presence or absence 

 of vegetation. If vegetation is present, then the botanist is compelled 

 to account for its presence by a consideration of the physiographic 

 history of that part of the earth's surface, the association of species 

 and the probable origin of these species, whether indigenous or derived. 

 The determination of the indigenous and derived species of a formation 

 or larger division is of the utmost importance, as it enables us to retrace 

 the steps by which the formation has reached its present condition 

 and association of species, and to reconstruct formations that have 

 long since disappeared. 



The methods which must be adopted in scrutinizing the flora of a 

 country are several: 



1. The botanist must determine the past and present physiography 

 of the region concerned. 



2. He must determine, if possible, the geologic time at which the 

 recorded physiographic changes took place. 



3. He must recognize the indigenous species by eliminating the 

 derived. 



4. A study of the distribution of species will enable him to determine 

 to some extent the age of the different fioristic elements, and the appli- 

 cation of the following criteria will also aid him in the solution of 

 questions such as are considered here. 



a. Location of greatest differentiation of type. 



h. Location of dominance or great abundance of individuals. 



c. Location of synthetic and closely related forms. 



d. Location of maximum size of individuals. 



e. Location of greatest productiveness and its relative stability. 

 /. Continuity and convergence of lines of dispersal. 



g. Location of least dependence upon a restricted habitat. 

 39 




602 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



h. Contiiiiiity and directness of individual variations, or modifica- 

 tions radiating from the centre of origin along the highways of dispersal. 

 i. Direction indicated by biogeographic affinities.* 



5. Old regions, botanically speaking, may be determined where the 

 number of specific forms of single genera is small, and new regions may 

 be determined where the number of species of single genera is ordinarily 

 very large. 



6. Drude's classification of endemic plants, as corresponding and 

 as relict, is of great assistance to the botanist in determining the age of 

 floristic elements. Plants are corresponding when the original con- 

 tinuous area of a variable species has been interrupted in such a way 

 ai3 to form several smaller areas occupied by subspecies or new species, 

 while relicts are those species originally of extensive distribution able 

 to maintain themselves in a limited area only on account of changed 

 conditions of life. Having enunciated these general principles, I will 

 endeavor to apply them in the determination of the age of the different 

 floristic elements of eastern North America. 



All of eastern America north of the great terminal moraine which 

 marks the southern boundary of the great ice sheet, with the exception 

 of the nunataks, has been tenanted by plants which have migrated 

 into the territory abandoned by the great continental glacier. Geolo- 

 gists believe, from evidence afforded by the time that it has taken for 

 the river to cut the gorge at Niagara, that 10,000 or 15,000 years have 

 elapsed since the close of the glacial period. If their deductions are 

 sound, then the flora of the northern part of eastern America cannot 

 be older than 15,000 years at the outside. Some of its elements may 

 be much older, and we have reason to believe that many boreal plants 

 existed as such on the nunataks, which were unglaciated areas above 

 the great ice sheet. The first wave consisted of the distinctly glacial 

 flora, which skirted the border of the ice sheet. The second wave, 

 younger as a floristic element of the North, consisted of boreal plants, 

 many of which, as bog plants, tenanted the bogs and margins of the 

 glacial lakes that were formerly much more abundant in the North 

 than at present. These bog and tundra types pushed early into the 

 barren ground left by the retreating ice. The tundra was closely 

 followed by the coniferous forests on the western and eastern sides of 

 the glaciated areas and these trees constitute a third floristic element, 

 much younger in point of the time in which they have occupied the 

 North, These trees, and those forming a still younger element, sur- 

 rounded the bog plant societies which were trapped by the surround- 



1 Adams, Chas. C, Biological Bulletin, III : 122, 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 603 



ing tree vegetation, and as the bog was gradually transformed by bio- 

 logic influences into firmer ground gradually encroached on the bog 

 plant associations. Present bog habitats are continuations of similar 

 habitats which existed in early postglacial times, when tundra 

 conditions and tundra vegetation were dominant.^ The fourth 

 element just mentioned consisted of deciduous shrubs and trees, 

 oaks, hickories and the like, which at present are south of the 

 great coniferous belt of forest. In the East, among the highlands, 

 exceptional circumstances were afforded for the preservation of the 

 northern forms. 



The flora of Mount Washington is perhaps an exception to this. 

 During the glacial period it was a nunatak, and during this time[it was 

 tenanted by such plants as Silene acaidis L., Arenaria groenlandica 

 Spreng., Geum radiatum Michx., SoUdago virga-aurea L. var. alpina 

 Bigel., Prenanthes hooiii Gray, Cassiope liyp7wides Don, Bryanthus 

 taxifolius Gray, Diapensia lapponica L., Oxyria digyna Hill, Salix phy- 

 lidfolia L., Salix uva-ursi Pursh, Salix herhacea L., Phleum alpinum 

 L., Lycopodium selago L., etc., which have remained as permanent 

 tenants of this mountain. If we take Mount Washington as a 

 mountain, the summit flora is older than that of the lower alpine 

 slopes of the mountain above timber-line, and the flora, therefore, of 

 these slopes is in turn older than that of such gorges as Tuckerman's 

 Ravine, Huntingdon Ravine and Great Gulf, which probably sup- 

 ported local glaciers for many centuries after the great ice sheet had 

 retreated from the Presidential Range. 



]\Iount Katahdin, 161 miles northeast of Mount Washington, has a 

 less number of alpine plants than that mountain, and most geologists 

 believe it to have been buried entirely beneath the glacial' ice sheet. 

 If that is so, then the alpine flora of Mount Katahdin is, as a floristic 

 element, much younger in point of time than that of Mount Washing- 

 ton. The same differential arrangement of the plants on Mount 

 Katahdin is found as on Mount Washington. The place where the 

 boreal flora, upon the retreat of the continental ice sheet, encroached 

 upon Mount Katahdin is determined largely by the physiography of 

 the mountain. The glaciers occupying the various basins of the 

 mountain retarded the revegetation of the mountain, but with a 

 favorable opportunity the encroachment perhaps began from the 

 southwest and west. This idea seems to be confirmed by the present 

 distribution of the spruce and fir which ascend higher on this side 

 and their apparently greater age. As to the east side of the mountain, 



*Transeau, E. N., Botanical Gazette, XXXVI: 401. 




604 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



and in particular the basins^ it seems probable that the great basin^ 

 was first tenanted by plants, and that the North Basin opposed this 

 migration a much larger time for the reason that this basin, which 

 presents a scene of desolation, was the seat of a local valley glacier 

 which was, perhaps, the last to disappear. As a consequence, the 

 basin presents an appearance even more xerophytic and alpine than 

 some of the upper parts of the mountain itself. The pucker bush 

 (Krummholz) reaches here an unusual development, with the trees 

 lying in most places prostrate and gnarled and twisted to a high degree. 



The swamp societies of the northern America stand in contrast to the 

 bog societies made up of more southerly forms, and must be considered 

 to be the normal hydrophjiLic vegetation of present climatic condi- 

 tions. The swamps of the North have had a much later origin than the 

 bogs, for we find that if the depressions pro\dded with water have ex- 

 isted since the days of the tundra they may show a bog flora to-day; 

 if they are of recent origin the plants will correspond to the normal 

 swamp plants of the present climatic conditions. 



Another interesting problem which presents itself is that of the 

 presence of typical seashore plants on the coasts of the Great Lakes. 

 Such plants as Ammophila arwtidinacea Hast., Sabbatia angularis Pursh, 

 Lathyrus maritimus Bigel., Hudsonia tomentosa Nutt., Cakile americana 

 Nutt., HibisciLs moscheutos L., Gerardia -purpurea L., Euphorbia polygo- 

 nijolia L., Myrica cerifera L., Strophostyles peduncularis Ell. are found 

 not only on the shores of the Great Lakes, but some of them near the 

 Lake of the Woods. The most satisfactory explanation seems to be 

 that in post-glacial times the valleys of the St. LawTence, Hudson, Lake 

 Champlain, and probably also Lakes Ontario and Superior, were then 

 occupied by the sea, because of the northeasterly depression of the 

 land. During this period of submergence the tjqoical seashore plants 

 gained access to the interior of the continent. 



The country south of the great ice sheet shows some interesting 

 problems of geographic dislribution in line mth the subject of this

are Tertiary, while those to the north of it arc Cretaceous. The Ter- 

 tiary soils extend southward along the Atlantic to Florida. As the 

 soil over both the Cretaceous and Tertiary is composed of similar 

 materials, it is impossible to say, from surface indications, where one 

 ends and the other begins. We will deal with the flora of the 

 northern extension of these sandy stretches of Cretaceous age. On 

 Staten Island these strata are exposed in its extreme southern 

 portion. They doubtless extend over the entire southern and eastern 

 sections, but are mostly covered by a laj^^er of material of variable 

 thickness derived from the glacial drift. On Long Island, the great 

 terminal moraine occupied a position marked by a range of hills extend- 

 ing throughout its whole length at an average distance of ten miles 

 from the Atlantic. South of these hills sandy plains prevail, the 

 material composing them having been formed partly from the modified 

 drift of the hiUs, partly from the underlying Cretaceous strata. 

 Those species detected on the Gretaceous soils of Staten Island, and 

 not on the drift, are thirty-four in number: Magnolia glauca L., Hud- 

 sonia ericoides L., Ascyrum crux-andrea L., Arenaria squarrosa Mich., 

 Polygala lutea L., Tephrosia virginiana Pers., Desmodiuvi Icevigatum 

 D. C, Desmodium viridif.ornm Beck, Riihus cuneifolms Pursh, Cra- 

 tcegus parvifolid Ait., Eupatorium rotundifolium L., Aster nemoralis

 pureum L., Gaylussacia dumosa J. and G., Andromeda mariana L., 

 Kalmia angustifolia L., Ipomoea pandurata Mej^er, Phlox suhulata L., 

 Asclepias obtusifolia Michx., Euphorbia ipecaciianhee L., Quercus nigra 

 L., Quercus prinoides Will., Quercus phellos L.. Spiranthes simplex Gray, 

 Juncus scirpoides Lam. var. macrostemon, Xyris flexuosa ]\Iuhl., Cy- 

 perus cylindricus N. L. B., Stipa avenacca L., Glyceria ohtusa Tin., Pani- 

 cum verrucosum Muhl., Andropogon macrourus ]\Iichx., Lycopodium 

 inundatum L, var. bigelorii Tuck. Of these the following four have 

 been detected in Suffolk County, Long Island : Desmodium viridifloriim 

 Beck, Rubus cuneif alius Pursh, Ipomoea pandurata Mej^er, Phlox subu- 

 lata L. In addition to the above list, however, the following sixteen 

 additional species have been detected in Suffolk county. Long Island : 

 Drosera filiformis Raf,, Ascyrum stans Michx., Eupatorium hyssopijolium 

 L., Eupatorium leucolepis T. and G., Eupatorium album L., Aster 

 spectabilis Ait., Solidago puberula Nutt., Chrysopsis falcata Ell., 

 Helianthus angustifolia L., Coreopsis rosea Nutt,, Utricularia subulata 

 Le Conte, Cupressus thy aides L., Juncus pelocarpus E. Meyer, Xyris 

 caroliniana Walt., Eleocharis melanocarpa Torr., Sporobolus serotinus 

 Gray. Thus it appears that thirty-four of these characteristic pine 




606 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



barren plants grow in the southern part of Staten Island, and that 

 forty-six of them have been detected in Suffolk county, Long Island. 



It would seem that these species have a tendency to follow the course 

 of the two more recent geologic formations throughout their whole 

 extent along the Atlantic coast. Another fact which stands out promi- 

 nently in this connection is that not a single one of the above-mentioned 

 plants, growing, as we have seen, along the edge of the glacial drift, 

 is native of Europe, but belong to a true American flora, which had its 

 origin in the southern part of the continent and migrated northward 

 into Staten Island and Long Island at the close of the great ice age. 

 In contrast to this fact we have another one, equally prominent, and 

 that is, that of the species of plants growing on the m^orainic material 

 about one-third are common to northern Europe and America, thus 

 pointing to a common origin of each in the territory now occupied by 

 the ice and snow of the Arctic regions. The flora north of the morainic 

 line in Staten Island and Long Island clearly antedates in point of 

 occupancy of the country the more southern and American pine barren 

 flora, which migrated northward at a date subsequent to the migration 

 of the flora with strong European affinity. 



Another interesting illustration of the historic factors instrumental 

 in plant distribution is afforded by the peculiar flora of the Kittatinny 

 or Shawangunk mountains of northwestern New Jersey, This moun- 

 tain chain forms a wall of almost constant altitude, averaging over 

 1 ,200 feet in height, along the eastern side of the Delaware river from 

 Port Jervis to the Delaware Water Gap. Its summits and western 

 slopes are composed of a coarse or fine, very hard silicious conglomerate 

 or sandstone, with little soil but that derived from the limited disin- 

 tegration of these rocks, and it is therefore highly silicious. While 

 the mountain sides are extensively glaciated there is very little glacial 

 drift on the ridge. 



On these mountains exist a number of plants which are also found 

 in great numbers in sandy soil along the Atlantic coast. Among the 

 species which are thus noteworthy, as discovered by N. L. Britton, are : 

 Juncus greenii Oakes and Tuckerm., Solidago puherula Nutt., Orordium 

 aquaticum L., Tephrosia virginiana Pers., Lespedeza hirta Ell., Lupinus 

 perennis L., Quercus ilicifolia Wang., Corema conradii Torrey. At 

 Culver's Gap were found by Britton : Polygala polygama Walt., Gerardia 

 pedicularia L., Lechea racemulosa j\Iichx., all abundant in sandy soil 

 along the coast, and Pru?ius pumila L. At Sunfish Pond, northwest 

 of the Water Gap, occur Juncus militaris Bigel., Lycopodium inun- 

 datum L., Viburnum nudum L. While all along the mountains grow 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 607 



Aster linariifolius L., Quercus ilicifolia, Gaylussacia resinosa Tott and 

 Gray, G. frondosa Torrey and Gray, Vaccinium vacillans Sol., Epigoea 

 repens L., Gaultheria procumhens L., Cassandra calyculata Don and 

 Rhododendron viscosum Torrey. Another peculiarity is the substitu- 

 tion of Pinus rigida Mill on the mountains for the Pinus strohus L. 

 of the surrounding country. 



The ridges of the Green Pond system, known at Greenwood Lake as 

 Bearfort and Bellvale mountains, and in New York as the Skunne- 

 munk, have a somewhat similar summit flora, consisting of Quercus 

 ilicifolia Wang., Solidago puberula Nutt., Tephrosia virginiana Pers., 

 Lespedeza hirta Ell., Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Spreng, Aster linariifolius 

 L., various huckleberries, blueberries and other sand plants. 



The reason for the somewhat remarkable similarity of the pine 

 barren and summit mountain floras is usually attributed to the simi- 

 larity of the soil on the mountains to that of the plains bordering the 

 coast. It is probably true that the plants occupy these areas because 

 they have adapted themselves to growing in soils of silicious sands, 

 but to say that the soil is the prime factor in their distribution is put- 

 ting the case too strongly. The writer believes, from an investigation 

 that he has made of the problems involved, that the flora of the moun- 

 tains is peculiarly an endemic one, showing relict endemism, and that 

 the flora of the pine barren is a derived one, and is an illustration of 

 Drude's principle enunciated above. The crest of the Kittatinny Moun- 

 tains represents the level of a plain that existed prior to the great period 

 of erosion which carved out the mountain ranges and has been several 

 times elevated and depressed. During the period of its more extensive 

 plain character, the plants above mentioned were distributed over 

 the area now represented by the crests of the Shawangunk Moun- 

 tains in New Jersey and the Skunnemunk IMountains in New 

 York. With the wearing away of the plain this more ancient flora 

 remained in a relict form on the smnmits of the mountains mentioned. 

 This antedated many years the upheaval of the New Jersey coast plain, 

 which was, after its appearance above the surface of the sea, an open 

 field for the migration of plants from nearby formations. The pioneers 

 into the elevated coastal plain were those species nearest at hand and 

 most mobile and, by reason of occupancy of a similar soil, well adapted 

 to meet the new conditions of environment. If we apply these princi- 

 ples to the problem in hand, we naturally reach the conclusion that 

 certain plants of the coastal flora are derived from the formations near- 

 est at hand which present similar environmental conditions, and are, 

 therefore, for the coastal region comparatively new, so that the summit 




608 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



flora of the mountains may be looked upon as relatively older in point 

 of time than that occupying the territory along the sea coast. 



An interesting confirmation of this position is found in a study of 

 the succession of the floras on the Pocono Mountain plateau, following 

 the destruction of the original forest by liunber operators. The 

 original vegetation of this plateau consisted, as far as I have been able 

 to determine, of four elements, viz. : a forest of pitch pine, Pinus rigida 

 Mill., which covered the looser morainic material of the great terminal 

 moraine in the eastern and southern parts of the plateau; the broad- 

 leaved deciduous forest mth its oaks and associated species on the 

 eastern slopes and edge of the tableland ; the chestnut and black locust 

 forest which occupied Laurel Ridge along the western rim of the plateau, 

 and a forest of white pine with a thicket of Rhododendron maxvnum L. 

 beneath, mixed in many places with the black spruce, Picea nigra Link, 

 the red maple and other plants characteristic of the Catskill mountains 

 and farther north, grading over to a hemlock forest in the region of 

 Tobyhanna. The open sphagnum bogs culminated in the presence 

 of the larch, Larix americajia ■\Iichx., with which were associated 

 Kalmia glauca Ait., Ledum latifolium Ait., Rhododendron rJiodora Don, 

 and other northern plants. With the destruction of the white pine, 

 hemlock and pitch pine forests, the vegetation of this tableland has 

 undergone an entire change. The succession of the species has not 

 been worked out in detail, but what has been observed is instructive. 

 The botanist is impressed by the general appearance of the landscape. 

 The flora over the eastern half of the plateau in aspect resembles that 

 of the pine barren regions of southern New Jersey, from which the 

 original pitch pine and Jersey pine have been cut. A study of the 

 species shows that this appearance is due to the close similarity of the 

 flora in the plant species which constitute the two regions. We have 

 an instructive example of mass invasion of such plants as Quercns 

 ilicifolia Wang., Pinus rigida ^Mill., Gaylussacia resinosa Torr. and 

 Gray, Vaccinium vaciUans Solander, Epigcea repens L., Gaidtheria pro- 

 cumbens L., Rhododendron viscosum Torr., Kalmia angustifolia L., 

 Lilium philadelphicum L., Amianthium inusccetoxicum Gray, Lyco- 

 podium inundatum L., etc., from the morainic hiUs westward into the 

 region occupied by the white pines. We natiu-ally inquire from what 

 locahty the pitch pine formation has proceeded, and it seems to me we 

 are forced to conclude that this association of species has been derived, 

 not from the barrens of New Jersey, but from the nearby mountains 

 northwest of the Delaware Water Gap which, as previously mentioned, 

 support such a flora. This relict flora on the Kittatinny and other 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 609 



highlands has been under unusual stress of circumstances, and when 

 more favorable, but on the whole similar, edaphic conditions w^ere 

 supplied, a mass invasion from these mountain highlands took place 

 at two different and widely divergent periods of time in two directions. 

 After the uplift of the Jersey pine barrens region, the nearby flora of 

 the upland plateaus being edaphically better adapted to the new region, 

 supplied the barren ground with a vegetable covering. Similarly, when 

 the glaciers retreated a mass invasion of pitch pines and associated 

 species moved from the unglaciated Kittatinny Mountains on to the 

 sandy gravelly soil of the great moraine, and when the lumbermen 

 disturbed the forest these plants, adapted to growing in sandy soils 

 and exposed to xerophytic conditions, supplied the constituent ele- 

 ments of the present flora in the greater part of the eastern half of the 

 plateau. 



A consideration of the strand flora of New Jersey, upon which I have 

 spent considerable study, reveals the fact that the time element is 

 important in an explanation of the distribution of the seashore plants. 

 If wc contrast the character of the association on the northern and 

 southern shore of New^ Jersey, we find that the formations on Barnegat 

 beach, for example, are usually open, while those on Wildwood beach 

 are closed and have culminated in the forest type of vegetation. This 

 argues for a greater age of the strand flora of Wildwood, as compared 

 with that, for example, at Sea Side Park in the north. This conclusion 

 is substantiated by the fact that the bays behind the sandy sea islands 

 are converted into salt marshes in the south, while in the north they 

 are wide and still open bays of brackish or salt water. Physiographi- 

 cally and botanically the coast line from Bay Head south to Ocean 

 City is younger than the coast south of the latter place extending to 

 Cape May. 



The latest periods of submergence and uplift had a powerful influ- 

 ence on the distribution of sea-coast species. The present distribution 

 of the swamp rose-mallow, Hibisnis moscheutos, in the Atlantic coastal 

 plain illustrates this. The plant normally occurs in brackish marshes 

 from Massachusetts to Florida and Louisiana and on lake shores in 

 saline situations locally in the interior to western Ontario. When it 

 occurs in fresh-water swamps it is reasonably certain that these swamps 

 represent a converted salt marsh present during a former time of sub- 

 mergence. New Jersey shows this best. During the Pensauken sub- 

 mergence southern central New Jersey was an extensive sea island sepa- 

 rated from northern New Jersey by Pensauken Sound. Hibiscus 

 moscheutos in its present distribution in New Jersey follows the former 




610 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



shore line of that ancient island, for it occurs in the salt marshes of the 

 coast, on both banks of the Delaware river to the head of tide water, 

 and also in fresh-water marshes along the New York Division of the 

 Pennsylvania Railroad between Trenton and Newark, the roadbed 

 between these cities being laid upon the geologic site of the Pensauken 

 Sound. 



South of New Jersey the region, including southeastern Pennsylvania, 

 may be divided historically according to the age of the flora into several 

 well-marked divisions. 



1. The flora of the Southern Appalachians and its northeastern 

 extension into southern and southeastern Pennsylvania. The facts 

 presented in two former papers'' all argue for the great antiquity of 

 the flora of North Carolina and southeastern Pennsylvania, because 

 this flora, in all probability, represents the more or less modified de- 

 scendants of that characteristic flora which in later Eocene or Miocene 

 time extended to high northern latitudes. 



2. The flora of the coast plain occupied by the long leaf pine with its 

 associated species, which probably represent the ultimate stages of 

 successions initiated at the time of the final elevation of the sea bottom 

 along the coast line. These plants probably entered the elevated 

 coastal region by a mass invasion from a circumscribed area contiguous 

 to the Atlantic shore line, for it has been established that contiguous 

 vegetation furnishes 75-90 per cent, of the constituent species of an 

 initial formation. The reason for this is to be found not only in the 

 fact that adjacent species have a much shorter distance to go and hence 

 wiU be carried in greater quantity, but also in that species of the forma- 

 tions beyond must pass through or over the adjacent ones. In the 

 latter case, Clement states that the "number of disseminules is rela- 

 tively small on account of the distance, whfle invasion through the 

 intermediate vegetation, if not entirely impossible, is extremely slow, 

 so that plants coming in by this route reach the denuded area only to 

 find it already occupied.'"' 



3. Plants of probable Neotropic origin which have, according to 

 Kearney, in all likelihood made their first appearance in the Appalachian 

 region in geologically very modern times, probably after the close of 

 the so-called glacial epoch.

4. A relict flora of a former widespread plateau region, similar to 

 the one mentioned for northeastern Pennsylvania, in which we find a 

 close similarity between the flora of some of the higher mountain sum- 

 mits and the flora of the coastal plain. We have previously mentioned 

 in the physiographic changes which have taken place in this mountain 

 region an explanation of such peculiarities of distribution. The pres- 

 ence of Hudsonia montana Nutt. on the summit of the Table Rock is 

 probably thus explained, for Table Rock represents an undenuded 

 remnant of a former peneplain. It is likely, therefore, that Hudsonia 

 montana Nutt. was once more extended in its distribution, but has been 

 isolated by the erosion of the plain on which it formerly grew in abun- 

 dance. The presence of Leiophyllum huxifolium Ell., Xerophyllum 

 asphodeloides Nutt., Amianthium musccetoxiciirn Gray on the mountain 

 summits and on the coastal plain is also similarly explained. 



5. The distribution of plants in the southern extremity of Florida is 

 an interesting confirmation of the historic development of a flora. 

 Seven plant formations can be recognized, viz.: (1) The sea-strand 

 formation; (2) The mangrove swamp formation; (3) The everglade for- 

 mation; (4) The grassland ("prairie ") formation; (5) The savanna 

 formation; (6) The pine-land formation; (7) The hummock-land for- 

 mation. Historically the sea-strand formation and the hummock-land 

 formation are the oldest, fioristically speaking. The strand flora, con- 

 sisting of such plants as Uniola paniculata, Panicum amarum, Ipomoea 

 pes-caprce, Batatas littoralis, Iva imbricata, Cakile maritima, Agave 

 decipiens (ontropic section), has existed as an element of the flora of 

 peninsular Florida since the land was elevated above the sea, and 

 perhaps was derived from an earlier seashore flora which existed along 

 the shore of the mainland or the coasts of the larger and more elevated 

 sea islands. 



Nearly all the tropic species recently added to the flora of the United 

 States were discovered in or about the hummocks, which are essentially 

 duplicated by similar formations in the West Indies. The total area 

 of the hummock-land is relatively insignificant when compared with 

 the pine-lands, yet the flora, as shown in the enumeration below, is 

 as rich, if not comparatively richer: 



Pine-lands, 43 per cent. 



Hummocks, 42 " 



Everglades, 15 " 



The hummocks consist of isolated groups of hardwood trees, shrubs 

 and vines. These hummock formations with an overlying soil thicker 

 than the pine-lands, due without doubt to the accumulation of vegetal 




612 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept.^ 



detritus, vary in size from an acre to many hundred acres, and are 

 scattered as islands in the everglades and pine forests instead of sur- 

 rounded by the ocean, as they formerly were before the sea bottom be- 

 tween them became dry land by elevation. The trees, shrubs and 

 woody \dnes harbor an almost incredible growth of plants of various 

 categories. The growth of epiphytes is especially striking, for in num- 

 erous cases the tree trunks and branches are completely clothed T^ith 

 air plants, and so prolific are the orchids and bromeliads that many 

 individuals are forced to growth on the ground and on the neighboring 

 pine trees.^ Here occur the great majority of flowering plants now 

 known to be common both to the West Indies and the mainland of 

 North America. As the rock of New Providence Island, of the Bahama 

 group, is essentially identical with that of the Florida south of Miami, 

 and as there are many trees and shrubs common to the two regions, as 

 well as to Cuba, while many species are endemic to each of the three 

 regions, we are forced to conclude from the e\adence that the flora 

 gives that geologically and to a certain extent floristically the hummock- 

 lands formed originally part of the AntiUean region. The hummock- 

 lands, perhaps, represent part of the ancient system of Keys which 

 existed at the time when the Gulf Stream left the American IMediter- 

 ranean through a channel which existed across the northern half of 

 Florida. It was when these islands formed an extended archipelago 

 coextensive -^dth the Bahamas that the hummocks were occupied by 

 their present flora, which, therefore, shows the closest relationship to 

 that of the nearby Bahama islands. With the elevation of the land 

 through the epeirogenic movements of the earth's crust, through the 

 agency of coral polyps, vegetation, ocean and wind currents, the Gulf 

 Stream was directed into its present channel and the sea islands which 

 now exist in south Florida in the form of hummocks were connected 

 by dry land or by partially submerged banks to form the present 

 peninsula of Florida. 



With the appearance of level plains by the removal of the shallow 

 sea over a sandy bottom, the isolated trees and herbaceous plants 

 which associated together constitute the savanna formation appeared 

 and clothed the ground. Imperceptibly these savaimas were trans- 

 formed by the appearance of trees into the pine-land formation. This 

 formation is characterized by a scattering growth of Pinus heterophylla

 Botanical Garden, III, No. 26, February, 1902; IV, Xo. 39, March, 1903; V, No.

and numerous shrubs, shrubby herbs and herbaceous perennials, 

 together T\dth a few annuals. Four species of palms belonging to the 

 genera Sabal, Serenoa, Coccothrinax, and the Sago palm, Zamia 

 floridana, are prominent representatives of the pine-land formation. 

 These pine-lands are light and airy, with comparatively thin soil. 

 The growth of timber is scattered and the plants found in this for- 

 mation are not duplicated in the West Indies. Relatively, then, the 

 flora of the pine-land formation is younger than that of the hummocks, 

 and may be older or younger than the everglade formation, according 

 to whether this association of species encroached on elevated plain 

 land or whether it captured grassland or an everglade formation. 

 The evolution of the pine woods may be represented for sake of 

 clearness diagrammatically as follows : 



Very Shallow Water 



I 

 Dry Elevated Sea Bottom Swamps 



I 

 Savanna Grassland 



Pine Woods 



The culmination from either condition has been a pine forest. 



The everglades, then, historically speaking, may be older than the 

 pine woods, or they may be j^ounger. 'X^^iatever their position in point 

 of time, they cover an area of about one hundred miles wide and perhaps 

 one hundred and fifty miles long, the elevation being about eighteen 

 feet above sea-level. This area consists of an extended saw-grass 

 swamp traversed by wdnding river channels, and covered with scattered 

 hummock-lands. Its flora consists of grasses, sedges and other herba- 

 ceous plants, among which are many aquatic and mud-inliabiting plants. 

 The vegetation of the everglades is of a more northern character than 

 that of the hummock-lands. 



The mangrove formation represents an important element in the 

 flora of southern Florida. The mangrove swamps are particularly 

 abundant along salt or brackish shores and along the sea islands, the 

 so-called Florida Keys.^ Their vegetation is confined almost exclu- 

 sively to the mangrove trees and such few Tillandsias and orchids as 

 grow upon their branches. Frequently on the borders of these swamps 

 occurs a large showy species of Acrostichum with leaves often six to 

 eight feet long. The area shut off from the sea by the fringe of man-

Lastly are the ruderal plants and weeds that, introduced by the 

 hand of man, have become established in America. The history of 

 the introduction and spread of many of these plants is known to an 

 exactness, whereas many have appeared and become established the 

 history of which is involved in considerable doubt. The time which 

 has elapsed since the advent of these outsiders does not exceed two or 

 three hundred years, and yet in that time many American varieties 

 of common European plants have by mutation or othei-^-ise arisen 

 to demarcate the American from the Eiuopean forms. 



I have endeavored to present in this paper the fact that the compo- 

 nent elements of the flora of eastern North America have had an his- 

 toric development, and I have attempted to give the methods of 

 determining their relative or comparative age, as w^ell as the philo- 

 sophic reasons underl}dng their distribution. The outcome of these 

 observations may be tabulated and arranged as follows, the top of

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW LAND SNAILS OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE. 

 BY H. A. PILSBRY and Y. HIRASE. 



In January of this year collecting was begun in Tokuno-shima, 

 Osumi, in the Riukiu chain, by Mr. Nakada, whose laurels as a collector 

 have been won by his able campaigns in the Islands of Izu (1903) and 

 other parts of the empire. His work was continued in the islands 

 southward, Okinoerabu-shima and Yoron-jima, completing the chain 

 from Oshima to Okinawa or Riukiu. Kume-jima, Riukiu, an islet west 

 of Okinawa, was then visited. No land mollusks had been collected 

 from any of these islands; and Mr. Nakada's results, as they are stud- 

 ied, are found to add enormously to our zoogeographic data on the 

 Riukiu group. The Miyakojima subgroup of the Southwestern islands 

 was also further explored, and some remarkable species of genera or 

 subgenera new to the fauna were obtained, such as Plectopylis hirasei, 

 a species of Chinese type, and Diplommatina vespa P. and H. 



The Clausiliidce obtained by Mr. Nakada greatly enlarge our knowl- 

 edge, about doubling the number of Riukiuan species, and adding 

 several new endemic groups, especially to the Zaptychoid phylum. 



Meantime Mr. Azuma has been collecting in southern Kyushu, 

 chiefly in Satsuma and its islands, particularly the Koshikijima group. 

 His results are good, although, as was expected, the number of new 

 species discovered was not great. Some unexpected forms were found, 

 such as Sitala rimicola Bens., a Himalayan species, and Clausilia 

 azumai, a fine snail belonging to the Riukiuan group Luchuphcedusa. 



A collector has also been sent to Eta-iwo-jima, of the Sulphur 

 group, near Ogasawara-jima, but the results were disappointing. It 

 seems to be, from the faunal indications, a very recent volcanic island. 

 It mil be remembered that Mr. Hatai lost his life a few years ago in an 

 attempt to collect upon these remote islets. 



The present paper deals only with the new species and subspecies 

 received, exclusive of the Clausiliidae.

The sculpture is much finer than in A. tancgashimcr , and the neck is 

 more constricted. It is more depressed than most Japanese species, 

 and it is more oblong in outline, viewed from above. 



Alycaeus tokunoshimanus n. sp. 



Shell depressed, light red. Whorls 3^, the first smooth and glossy, 

 the following ones nearly smooth to the last whorl, which is very densely 

 and finely rib-striate, the striae weak or wanting on the neck. The 

 last half of the last whorl is much enlarged and somewhat straightened, 

 moderately constricted at the neck, enlarged beyond it and deeply 

 deflexed. The aperture is oblique, circular; the peristome continuous, 

 thickened outside and bevelled to the edge.

outline, with the neck nearer the aperture and the peristome stronger. 

 The sutural "tube" is long, as in A. purus. 



Alyoaeus laevicervix n. sp. 



The shell is rather depressed, light olive greenish. Whorls 3^, the 

 first projecting and smooth, the rest finely rib-striate and latticed by 

 lower, finer spiral striae. The last half of the last whorl is swollen, wdth 

 closer rib-striae, the spirals becoming obsolete. The sutural "tube" is 

 short and irregular. The neck is moderately contracted, and smooth 

 to the aperture. Aperture oblique, circular, the peristome somewhat 

 thickened, with a low thin rib close to the edge.

This species is related to A. satsumanus, but it is larger, with a shorter 

 sutural "tube," a smooth neck, and more prominent spiral striae. 



Pupinella osMmae tokunosMmana n. subsp. 



The shell is dirty white, more slender than P. oshimce, and umbilicate, 

 the umbilicus half covered by the lip, and bounded by a very strong 

 keel. The upper or anal notch of the aperture is narrow, straight and 

 oblique, its two bounding walls of nearly equal length, while in P. 

 oshimce the outer lip of the canal is decidedly shorter than the inner, 

 and the canal is thus enlarged and opens more backwards. The parietal 

 callous and that at the opening of the anal canal are less extensive than 

 in P. oshimce.

Cyolotus nudus n. sp. 



Shell openly umbilicate, lusterless, whitish under a very thin slightly 

 yellowish cuticle, readily lost, with an opaque whitish sutural margin 

 from which short whitish streaks radiate. The surface is but slightly 

 roughened by growth-lines, and an intermediate whorl of the spire is 

 very finely, closely striate spirally; the last Ih whorls hardly or not 

 showing spirals. The spire is small and acutely conic. The first 1^ 

 whorls are brown, project nipple-like, and are distinctly tilted. Whorls 

 4J to 4:h, very convex, the last tubular, barely in contact with the pre- 

 ceding at the aperture. The aperture is circular, vertical, the peris- 

 tome simple. The operculum is whitish and lodges just within the 

 peristome, is concave externall}', with a sunken smooth nucleus and 

 a spiral lamella closely revolving on the other whorls.

 tubular, parted by a deep suture, the last whorl at the aperture barely 

 in contact with the preceding. Aperture slightly oblique, circular, 

 the peristome thin and simple. The operculum lodges a short distance

This species is intermediate in contour between the Japanese C. 

 micron Pils. and C. innocens Sykes of Ceylon. It is much more ele- 

 • vated than the former species. This species and Cyclotiis micron belong 

 evidently to the subgenus Jerdonia of the genus Cyathopoma, the oper- 

 culum being discoidal and somewhat biconcave, as in Cyclotus. Both 

 Cyathopoma and Jerdonia are Indian groups, not hitherto reported 

 from China or from any part of the Japanese Empire. 



DIPLOMMATINIDiE. 



The Diplommatinas of Japan and the Riukiu Islands are very closely 

 related to those of China. Besides Adelopoma,^ two subgenera or 

 sections of DiplommMina are represented. 



I. — Constriction at the beginning of the last whorl, in front, or on the 

 latter part of the penultimate whorl on the right side; a palatal 

 plica and a parietal or "spiral" lamella developed in front of 

 the constriction, to which the columellar lamella also extends.

 the Bornean Paradiancta. 

 Diplommatina tosana n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, cylindric, the upper third conical, tapering; light 

 red, darker red toward the apex, paler and sometimes more of a yellow 

 tint toward the last whorl; closely, finely and delicately rib-striate 

 throughout, the striae becoming more widely spaced on the cone, the 

 first whorl smooth. Whorls 6^, the last rounded below, ascending in 

 front. The weakly marked constriction near the end of the penulti- 

 mate whorl is close to the peristome, being immediately behind it. The 

 apertiu-e is round-ovate; peristome narrowly reflexed, strengthened by 

 a "coDar" or lamella a short distance behind it. The parietal callous 

 extends nearly to the suture above. The columellar lamella is strong. 

 Palatal plica long, ^dsible through the parietal callous, and not 

 extending beyond it.

 which is also a more slender species. 

 Diplommatina tosanella n. sp. 



This form is very similar to D. kyushuensis in contour and appear- 

 ance. The last two whorls are dull red, the rest of the spii-e bright 

 orange-red. Sculpture of fine close rib-strise on the last two whorls, 

 while on the spire the intervals between riblets are about twice as wide, 

 ^^lorls nearly 6^, convex, the slight constriction being in the middle 

 of the front side, visible externally as an oblique light line; the last 

 whorl is rounded below. Aperture nearly circular, the peristome thick- 

 ened outside. Parietal callous rather small, not approaching the 

 sutiu-e above. The columellar tooth is small. Palatal plica short, 

 wholly to the left of the parietal callous and situated as high as its 

 upper edge. The columellar and spiral lamellae and palatal plica are 

 low inside, not nearly so strong as in D. kyushuensis.

lip pale yellowish Very delicately and evenly striate throughout. 

 Whorls 6^, convex, the last whorl very obtusely angular at the base, 

 very much swollen on the ventral face to the left of the parietal callous. 

 It is distinctly constricted in front, at or shortly in front of the inser- 

 tion of the outer lip. The aperture is very irregular in shape, the 

 peristome strongly thickened outside, bevelled and obtuse, the back 

 of the lip-thickening being white. Columellar margin straightened, 

 vertical, the columella bearing a strong tooth. Parietal callous ex- 

 tending in a rather narrow lobe nearly to the suture. Palatal plica 

 long, in large part overlaid by the parietal callous.

This species is readily distinguished by the conspicuous swelling of 

 the last whorl in front of the aperture. The tapering portion of the 

 spire is longer than in most allied species. 



Diplommatina goniobasis n. sp. 



Shell cylindric below, tapering and conic above, dull red. Surface 

 finely and evenly striate. "UTiorls 6^, convex, the last ascending in 

 front, becoming biangidar on its last half, the angles obtuse, one near 

 the suture, the other bounding the flattened basal area, the surface 

 between the angles being flattened. The constriction is at the termi- 

 nation of the outer lip. The aperture is very irregular in shape, the 

 lip heavily thickened with a wide but rather thin external rib. Colu- 

 mella vertical, short, with a verj^ strong horizontal lamella. The pala- 

 tal plica is short and wholly covered by the parietal caUous, which 

 extends nearly to the suture.

This species is very distinct by its irregular aperture, strong colu- 

 mellar lamella and peristome, and the biangular last whorl. It is 

 related to D. gibbera. 

 D. g. onoensis n. subsp. 



The specimens from Onomura, Tosa, are dirty yellowish in color, 

 with the two angles of the last whorl less strong and the constriction a 

 little more receding, so that it falls behind the insertion of the outer 

 lip. 

 Diplommatina kyushuensis n. sp. 



Shell obesely fusiform, the penultimate whorl largest, those above 

 tapering regularly, the last whorl also smaller. Pale yellowish-brown,

sometimes Avhitish. Sculptm'e of very fine, low and delicate vertical 

 striae, obsolete on the front of the last whorl, and often largely lost by 

 wear. Whorls 6^, convex, the constriction at the beginning of the last 

 whorl, above the insertion of the outer lip; last whorl rounded below. 

 Aperture vertical, subcircular, the peristome refiexed, thickened within, 

 continuous in a delicate callous with raised edge across the parietal 

 wall; somewhat angular at the junction of the columellar and basal 

 margins. Columellar lamella strong at the mouth and opposite the 

 palatal plica. Palatal plica strong and long, its inner end only under 

 the parietal callous. Spiral lamella long but rather low.

 kijima, Satsuma; Watarimura, Kiyoragi and Fukuregi in Higo; Sa- 

 ganoseki, Bungo; and Obi, Huga. 



We formerly considered these forms to belong to D. cassa; but 

 further study has shown them to be shorter and less cylindric than 

 cassa, with a more ventrally situated and more distinct constriction. 

 D. cassa has not yet been found in Kyushu, and D. kyushuensis has 

 not occurred in Hondo or Shikoku. The form from Kami-Koshiki- 

 jima. Satsuma, is slightly smaller and more slender. Most species of 

 these islets show more or less modification. 

 Diplommatina tokunoshimana n. sp. 



Shell conic above, cylindric below, dull reddish, rather closely, finely 

 and delicately striate. Whorls 6^, moderatel}^ convex, the last rounded 

 below, strongly ascending in front. Constriction slight, just in front 

 of the upper insertion of the peristome. Aperture circular, with a 

 notch at the base of the columella, the peristome thick, thickened out- 

 side. Columella straight. Columellar tooth strong. Parietal cal- 

 lous large, approaching the sutm-c above. Palatal plica moderately 

 long, situated under the parietal callous.

Shell obese-fusiform, the penultimate whorl large and swollen, the 

 spire conic, last whorl smaller; dull reddish-brown; evenly, closely 

 and almost obsoletely striate. Whorls 6^, very convex, the last well 

 rounded. Constriction slight, situated in front of the insertion of the

 the last whorl is convex, not flattened and tapering as in that species. 

 Diplommatina kumejimana n. sp. 



The lower half of the shell is cylindric, the upper half tapering in a 

 long cone; dull red; evenl}^, delicately striate. "Wliorls 7, convex, the 

 last whorl convex below, ascending in front. The constriction is at 

 the end of the penultimate whorl, close behind the upper insertion of 

 the peristome. The aperture is circular; peristome thickened and 

 reflexed. Columella arcuate, with a small columellar tooth. Parietal 

 callous approaching the suture above. Palatal plica moderately long, 

 wholly under the callous.

 constriction is behind the peristome, while in D. oshimce it is in front, 

 above the aperture. 

 Diplommatina lateralis n. sp. 



The upper half of the shell is long-conic, the lower half cylindric, 

 but the penultimate whorl is contracted on the right side. Dull 

 brownish-yellow, evenly, delicately striate. Wliorls 7^ to 7f , convex, 

 the last well rounded, somewhat ascending in front. Constriction 

 lateral, on the penultimate whorl some distance behind the lip. Aper- 

 ture subcircular, the lip thickened, expanded and reflexed. Columella 

 bearing a quite small tooth. Parietal callous not extensive. The pala- 

 tal plica is concealed by the suture, from its recession following the 

 constriction.

 sive. Palatal plica long, partly under the callous, partly projecting 

 beyond it.

This is the largest Sinica of the Riukiu Islands which we have yet 

 obtained. The columellar tooth is very small in a front view. 

 Diplommatina vespa n. sp. 



Shell oblong, the upper third conic, the rest subcylindric ; dull red 

 or ashy brown. Sculptured mth delicate rib-strige which are fine and 

 close on the cylindric portion of the shell, much more widely spaced 

 upon the conic spire, the first 1^ whorls smooth. Whorls 8 to 8^, very 

 convex. The penultimate wJwrl abruptly contracts in front or on the 

 left side and continues narrow to the end, the last whorl being of nor- 

 mal proportions and very convex throughout. The aperture is sub- 

 circular, the lip broadly expanded and reflexed. The columellar la- 

 mella is rather small at the mouth, but larger inside. It ascends nearly 

 two whorls, to the constriction, where there is also a rather small 

 palatal plica, but no parietal spiral lamella.

The closing apparatus recedes much more deeply in this than in 

 other Japanese Diplommatinas, but it does not lie quite so far back as 

 in a Bornean group of which D. everetti Smith is typical, called Paradi- 

 ancta, and subordinated to the genus Diancta by von MoUendorff and 

 Kobelt, whose classification of the Diplommatinidce shows some strange 

 groupings for which no reason is apparent. The section Metadiancta 

 MUdff., based upon a series of Diplommatinas from the northeastern 

 frontier of India, has also some similarity. These forms as described 

 by Godwin-Austin are characterized by the position of the constriction, 

 which is on the side, near the end of the penultimate whorl, behind the 

 peristome, as in D. lateralis and kumejimana, described above, but 

 differing from them in the deficient internal armature. 



It seems that in various places forms of Diplommatina have inde-

pendently arisen having a tendency toward recession of the closing 

 apparatus.

This name is to replace that of E. friedeliana goniosoma P. and H.,

 Eulota (JEgista) omma n. sp. 



The shell has the general shape of E. ocidus (Pfr.). It is yellowish 

 olivaceous-brown, densely obliquely striate above, more glossy and 

 smoother below, the first two whorls nearly smooth. Whorls 7, but 

 slightly convex, enlarging slowly and regularly ; the last w^horl slightly 

 deflexed in front, obtusely angular at the periphery, the base very con- 

 vex. The deep and ample umbilicus is nearly one-third the diameter 

 of the shell; its last half-whorl enlarges more rapidly. The aperture 

 is rather small, hardly larger than the umbilicus, oblique, rounded, the 

 preceding whorl excising about one-fourth of the circle. Peristome 

 narrowly reflexed throughout, the columellar margin very steeply 

 ascending, hardly dilated.

This species was at first thought to be the Formosan Mgista sub- 

 chinensis 'NevilP Mlldff.,^ but further study of the description and 

 the finding of a Formosan specimen in the collection of the Academy 

 have shown that material differences exist between the Formosan and 

 Riukiuan forms. In subchinensis the columellar margin slopes to 

 the insertion instead of rising almost vertically as in E. omma— much 

 more steeply in fact than in E. ocidus, which is the most closely related 

 species.

 Alt. 9, diam. 15.5 mm.; whorls 6f (fossil). 

 Alt. 8, diam. 14.5 mm. ; whorls 6. 



The color also in the small form is concentrated, being of decidedly- 

 darker shade than in the larger shells. 



The names E. omnia and E. oculiis allude to the appearance 

 of the basal aspect of the shell — a dark pupil-like umbilicus surrounded 

 by a brownish band, like the iris of the eye. 

 Eulota (Euhadra) okinoerabuensis n. sp. 



Shell very narrowly umbilicate, moderately depressed with conoidal 

 spire. The specimens are fossil, white with a narrow reddish band 

 above the periphery. The surface in the best preserved specimens 

 is glossy, sculptm-ed with weak wrinkles along growth-lines, and very 

 fine, faint, close spiral strise. Whorls about 5f, slowly increasing, 

 convex, the last rounded below and at the periphery, very slightly 

 deflexed in front. The aperture is slightly oblique, lunate, the lip thin, 

 narrowly expanded, slightly re flexed, dilated at the axis, half covering 

 the small umbilicus.

This is a small, elevated member of the group of E. mercatoria, as 

 yet only found fossil. The very small umbilicus and elevated spire 

 give it something the appearance of the large form of E. siibmandarina 

 of Yakushima. 

 Eulota callizona montivaga n. subsp. 



This race resembles E. c. minor Gude in general appearance, but it 

 is more conic, less globose. The aperture consequently is lower and 

 wider. 



The color is (1) either yellow, with a light reddish-brown peripheral 

 belt, a darker streak at the back of the lip, and some tinting with the 

 same color around the umbilicus, or (2) greenish-yellow, with three 

 blackish-brown bands, the first one very narrow, bordering the suture, 

 the second wide, at the periphery, and the third is a circular area cover- 

 ing the greater part of the base. The lip is purplish in all specimens 

 seen.

A small, rather thin, globose race, less depressed than E. d. kikaiensis, 

 thinner, and with no roseate streaks, the peristome not pink-lipped, 

 though the columella Ls pale flesh-tinted. It is weakly, irregularly

This form is very thin and light, like E. sicboldiana, from which it 

 differs by the decidedly open umbilicus (like that of E. despecta) and 

 by being distinctly decussate throughout, with close spiral striae 

 crossing the oblique, irregular growth-wrinkles. Whorls 5^. Color

This is one of thos.e perplexing forms which unite characters of two 

 very distinct species. It might be treated as a subspecies of E. sic- 

 boldiana, of E. despecta, or a distinct species, according to the weight 

 one places upon this or that feature. Indeed, one of us had provision-

This is a larger species than E. commoda A. Ad., with less conic spire 

 and better developed peristome. 

 Trishoplita nitens n. sp. 



Shell umbiUcate, depressed, with very low conoid spire, obtusely 

 angular periphery and convex base ; thin, glossy, rather bright green- 

 ish-yellow, the earlier whorls denuded and bluish-white. Surface 

 weakly marked mth wrinkles along growth-lines, and showing some 

 very faint spiral striae on the base. Whorls 5. slowly increasing, the 

 last wide, slightly deflexed in front. Aperture oblique, oval-lunate, the 

 peristome thin, narrowly expanded.

A very bright, glossy and depressed species, of a genus not before 

 reported from any island south of Kyushu. 

 CMoritis obscurus n. sp. 



Shell umbilicate, somewhat depressed, the spire low-conoidal; thin, 

 and dull, dark brown. Siu-face lusterless, slightly striate and indis- 

 tinctly punctate in places, the points bearing no hairs 

 and rather irregularly spaced. Whorls nearly 5, the last 

 about double the width of 

 the preceding, very slightly 

 descending at the aperture, 

 rounded at the periphery. 

 Aperture broadly lunato- 

 oblique, the peristome thin, 



brown, narrowly expanded 

 throughout, more broadly 

 dilated at the umbilical 

 insertion.

Tokunoshima, Osumi. Type No. 

 1,227 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



A small, dull species, known b}' 

 a single specimen, but very unlike 

 any other Riukiuan or Japanese species 

 yet known. The convex spire and 

 expanded lip, as well as the very obscure punctulation, are its more 

 prominent characteristics. 



Surface X 25 ; one square 

 millimeter indicated. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 629 



The surface under a strong magnification is seen to be very densely, 

 microscopically, irregularly granulate (this sculpture too small to be 

 shown in the figure), and set with low, rounded or oblong grains 

 arranged more or less obviously in oblique lines, in most places less 

 regular than where the figure was taken, on the upper part of the last 

 whorl, a short distance behind the aperture. The whitish apical whorl 

 seems to be slightly rugose, but not punctate. 



Chloritis tosanus osumiensis n. pubsp. 



This form agrees in shape and color with C. tosanus, but it differs 

 in being smaller, with the hairs a little more widely spaced. The spire 

 is somewhat convex. Avith the apex turned down; whorls 4; lip thin 

 and sharp.

Koneshima is a place on the western coast of Osumi, on Kago-shima 

 Bay, about opposite the southern extremity of Satsuma. 



Ganesella tokunoshimana n. sp. 



Shell narrowh^ umbilicate, globose-conoidal, thin, the outlines of 

 the spire convex, apex very obtuse. Yellow, with (1) four black-brown 

 bands, a narrow one below the suture, a wide one at and above the 

 periphery, a narrower band midway between periphery and umbilicus, 

 and a fourth band inside the umbilicus, or (2) very pale reddish-brown 

 fading to yellowish near the suture and on the base, with a narrow 

 light band at the peripher}-. 



Surface glossy, the first 2 whorls smooth ; then faint growth-lines 

 and spiral striae appear ; these become progressively stronger, the last 

 w^horl being covered wdth close incised spirals. Whorls 5^, convex, 

 the last but slightly or not defiexed in front, angular or subangular at 

 the periphery in front, becoming rounded on the last half or third, con- 

 vex beneath. The aperture is oblique, widely lunate, colored within 

 like the outside. The lip is thin, narrowly reflexed, white, at least at 

 the edge, dark at the ends of the bands, the columellar margin dilated.

 of Mr. Hira.se's collection. 



This beautiful species stands close to G. adelimc of Oshinia and G. 

 sororcula of Kikaiga-shima, but differs from both in the obtuse spire, 

 the early whorls being depressed. It is less closely related to G.

 no noticeable spiral striation, and a conic spire. 

 Ganesella myomphala okinoshimana n. subsp. 



Shell imperforate, smaller than G. myomphala. with a much wider 

 (1.5 to 2 mm.) peripheral dark band. Whorls 6^ to 6^.

Like G. m. minor Glide, of Awaji, this is a small insular form, but 

 doubtless independently evolved. 

 Ganesella selasia textilis n. subsp. 



Similar to G. selasia in the somewhat triangular aperture and rather 

 large umbilicus, but differing in the following respects: The spire is 

 lower, more convexly conoidal; the surface is very minutely, obso- 

 letely and irregularly granulose in places, and there are irregular spiral 

 lines on the base, especially near the umbilicus; just above the periph- 

 ery there is a very faint brown band; and, finally, the lip is white and 

 thicker than in selasia. Whorls about 5^, the last slightly deflexed in 

 front and noticeably contracted behind the peristome.

 Ganesella selasia zonata n. subsp. 



The shell is much more depressed than G. selasia or G. s. textilis, 

 openly umbilicate, with low, convexly conoid spire and depressed last 

 whorl, which is almost angular in front. Surface glossy, very minutely 

 and densely but subobsoletely granulose. ^^^lorls about 5i, the last 

 wide, slightly deflexed in front, and usually somewhat contracted 

 behind the peristome. The aperture is subtriangular, the lip white and 

 somewhat thickened. The shell is light brown- or corneous-brown, 

 with a narrow brown band immediately above the periphery, and 

 ascending the spire just above the suture.

Amasaki, Tosa. Tjq^es No. 85,728, A. N. S. P.. from No. 1,107 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



The low spire gives this subspecies an appearance very different from 

 G. selasia. It is much more closeh^ related to G. s. textilis; and it has 

 affinity to G. wiegmanniana, also a Shikoku species; but both zonata 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 631 



and textilis differ from iviegmanniayia in minute sculpture and in the 

 somewhat triangular shape of the mouth — characters allying them to 

 3elasia of Kii. It is quite impossible at present to fix definitely the 

 status of many of these forms, which often have affinities with several 

 very dissimilar species. In the series of selasia, textilis, zonata and 

 wiegmanniana the umbilicus is much larger than in G. japonica, G. 

 ferruginea and the forms grouping around them. 



STREPTAXID^. 

 Ennea iwakawa miyakojimana n. subsp. 



This race resembles E. i. oshimana, but the parietal lamella is longer

This minute, cylindrical species is very unlike any hitherto known 

 from the region, but closely resembles P. 7ninutissima Hartm. of central

Europe. The latter, however, is a sUghtly larger species with strongly 

 striate surface, while insulivaga is smooth. The palatal plica also 

 differentiates the snail of Yoronjima from its European relative. 



ZONITID^. 

 Trochomorpha cultrata n. sp. 



Shell openly umbilicate, much depressed, the spire low-conic, base 

 convex; light reddish-brown, rather thin. Surface slightly shining, 

 very minutely striate, the lower surface most minutely decussate with 

 spiral striae. Whorls 6f , the first two convex, the rest convex below 

 the suture, concave above the following suture. Last whorl very 

 acutely carinate, concave above and below the keel, distinctly angular 

 around the conic umbilicus. Aperture small, oblique, rhombic, with 

 thin, unexpanded peristome.

Kaliella kikaigashimae n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, thin, pale yellowish, somewhat translucent, 

 glossy; trochiform, the outlines of the spire nearly straight, the periph- 

 ery rounded, and the base convex. Whorls nearly 5, convex, parted 

 by a deeply impressed suture. Aperture broadly crescentic, the colu-

This species is quite unlike any reported hitherto from the Riukiu 

 Islands. It is much larger than K. himaris, the most nearly related 

 of the Riukiu species, the color is paler and the aperture a more ample 

 crescent. It is the first Kaliella to be found on Ivikaiga-shima. 

 Kaliella liumiliconus n. sp. 



Shell perforate, amber-colored, somewhat dull above, glossy be ncath; 

 conic above the spire with nearly straight, slightly convex lateral out- 

 lines and obtuse apex, the periphery carinate, base convex. Whorls 

 5J, convex, separated by an impressed sutm-e. Aperture truncate-

 iyamana. 



Kaliella okinosMmana n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, trochoidal, elevated, amber colored, subtrans- 

 lucent, glossy. The outlines of the spire are very slightly convex, 

 nearly straight. Apex obtuse; the periphery has a delicately project- 

 ing acute keel, and the base is convex. Whorls 6^, slightly convex. 

 Suture narrowly margined above. The aperture is squarish-oblong, a

 Mr. Hirase's collection. Also Kozujima, Izu, No. 1,091. 



The islands of Izu have a fauna of great interest, though it is not 

 rich in species. Some forms, like Zaptyx in the Clausiliidse and the 

 varieties of Eulota suhmandarina, show close affinity to the Riukiu 

 fauna, and can scarcely have reached these islands in any other way 

 than by drift along the Black Current. Others, like the present species, 

 are related to Yesso forms, and probably indicate a former extension 

 southward upon the main island of species now northern in distribu- 

 tion. 

 Kaliella pallida Pils. 



This species was described from Hachijo-jima, Izu, in error. It 

 comes in reality from Mizuma-mura, Izumi. The types are 83,378, 

 A. N. S. P., from No. 952 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 

 Microcystina vaga n. sp. 



Shell almost imperforate, depressed trochiform, amber-colored, sub- 

 transparent, smooth and glossy. Spire low-conic with convex outlines. 

 Whorls 6, convex, slowly increasing, the last subangular at the periph- 

 ery, convex beneath. Aperture lunate, the columella thickened with 

 a white callous within, dilated and re flexed above.

There are more whorls than in M. tanegashimce. M. ohtusangida is 

 a more depressed species. 

 Microcystina lampra n. sp. 



Shell perforate, depressed-trochiform, pale amber colored, subtrans- 

 parent, smooth and glossy. Spire low^-conoid, with slightly convex

 re flexed above. 



Alt. 2.9, diam, 4 mm. 



Yakushima, Osumi. Tjrpes No. 87,558, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,282 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. Also No. 1,282a from Kuchinoerabushima, 

 Osumi. 



This species closely imitates M. vaga, but it is readily distinguishable 

 by the rounded, not angular, last whorl. The whorls arc more closely 

 coiled than in M. tanegashimce, and larger than M. yakuensis. Some 

 specimens from Matsubara-miura, Echizen (Mr. Hirase's No. 6066), 

 where M. vaga would be expected, seem to be M. lampra. 



This group of species is somewhat difficult, M. tanegashimce is a 

 larger species than M. yakuensis, more depressed than vaga or lampra, 

 with fewer whorls, the last one wider. M. yakuensis is probably iden- 

 tical with M. nuda, and both stand close to M. hilgendorfii Reinh.; but 

 that is described as whitish — "albida" — while the others are yellow or 

 amber colored. M. circumdata differs from all of the above species 

 in being spirally striate. 



Macrochlamys dnlois koshikijimana n. subsp. 



This form has the shape and microscopic spiral striation of M. dulds 

 Pils., with the same number of whorls, but the spire is more elevated, 

 and viewed from above it is wider.

In a specimen of M. dulcis of the same diameter the spire is a milli- 

 meter narrower. 



Maoroohlamys subelimatus n. sp. 



Shell perforate, depressed, pale yellow, translucent, smooth and 

 •glossy. Spire very low-conic. Whorls 4^, slowly increasing, the last 

 very wide, double the width of the preceding, rounded at the periphery 

 and base, indented around the perforation. Aperture slightly oblique, 

 lunate, the lip thin and simple, a trifle dilated at the columollar inser- 

 tion.

surface. It has a half whorl more, the last one embracing more of the 

 preceding whorl, causing the aperture to be more narrowly lunar. 

 The last whorl is much wider, viewed from above, than in the species 

 of Microcystina of similar size.

 slightly convex. Pale greenish corneous-brown when fresh, " dead " 

 shells light brown. Surface glossy, closely, deeply and a little irregu- 

 larly striate throughout except the first whorl which is nearly smooth. 

 There are no spiral strise. Whorls 4, slowly increasing at first, the 

 last whorl much wider, double the width of the penultimate, rounded 

 at the periphery. Apertm'e oblique, oval-lunate, decidedly wider than 

 high, the peristome simple as visual.

 impressed in the center. Brown. Very finely and regularly striate 

 radially above, smooth below. WTiorls 5, convex, very slowly widen-

This species is the size of P. japonicum or somewhat smaller, but 

 differs from that by its fine sculpture, without wide-spaced riblets. 

 Punctum rota n. sp. 



Shell moderately umbilicate, pale greenish-corneous or oUve-brown, 

 shining, sculptured with delicate, wide-spaced oblique riblets, the in- 

 tervals finely striate. Spire low-conic. Wliorls 3^, convex, the last 

 rounded peripherally and beneath. Aperture quite oblique, rounded, 

 nearly one-third of the circle excised by the penultimate whorl. Peris-

This form is more elevated and more rounded peripherally than P. 

 pretiosum Gude. The umbilicus is larger than in P. morseanum. Very 

 similar specimens, but of perceptibly darker brown color, were collected 

 on Okinoerabushima, Osumi. Although so distant from the type 

 locality, I can find no other distinctive characters.

 colony of Lasius latipes, Stenamma fiilvum and their own kind. They 

 had then been transferred to their present abode, where they had lived 

 for eleven months, never meeting ants of other species, except upon a 

 few rare occasions when I introduced a visitor into their nest. On 

 August 20, 1904, they were happily occupied in care of some promising 

 pupae from their old wild nest, when I dropped into their nursery a 

 single Lasius latipes, somewhat larger and probably older than any of 

 their number. She was a stranger from the wild nest of their quondam 

 associates. As I dropped the strong-smehing, vigorous yellow worker 

 into their nest, I glanced at my watch to note the minutes they would 

 spend in slaying the intruder. \Mien I looked back at the ants, I was 

 at once impressed by the curious and sudden change in the positions 

 of all the little black Cremastogasters and by the remarkable rigidity 

 of five of them. Five were in the food-room, and they do not enter 

 fiulher into this narration; two were on the roof-pane of the nursery; 

 and five were motionless under the 

 touches of the Lasius, who, instead of 

 fleeing or hiding, as do ants who are 

 among enemies outnumbering them, was 

 traversing two sides of the nursery at a 

 leisurely-rapid pace from the hallway, 

 marked H, to the corner marked A 

 where there was a little pile of pupa^, 

 and then on to the B corner where 

 was a similar pile. She made more than 

 eleven journeys to and fro, taking nearly

The straight lines indicate the the same track, sometimes walking ovcr 

 an ant or two, sometimes brushing the 

 side of one as she passed, sometimes 

 slightly varj'ing her route so as to pa-ss 

 between two on the A B side of the nest. Whatever her course, every 

 ant of the five swayed the abdomen slowly toward her as she passed, 

 and swayed it back as soon as she had passed it. This swaying of the

abdomen, with slight movements of the antennse, were the only signs 

 of life given by any of the five ants during forty-five minutes. Mean- 

 time one of the other residents came down from the roof-pane, and 

 while the yellow ant was at H with the heads of all the spellbound 

 ones turned away from her, this solicitous sister went and touched 

 three of the entranced ones, but failing to rouse them, she withdrew 

 again beyond the line of the yellow visitor's march. I was observing 

 the ants through a pane of orange-tinted glass which protected them 

 from such ligiit as they were aware of/ and I several times lifted the 

 pane, letting the daylight tall full upon them, but even this stimulant 

 did not impel any of them to move. 



During all this time none of the five ants that were in the food-room 

 returned through the only ingress therefrom, the hallway H, and the 

 young, ordinarily attended upon without intermission, were wholly 

 neglected. The yellow ant finally stayed awhile in the hallway, and 

 within the ensuing five minutes all the three ants between A and B 

 began to walk slowly forward. I then shoved the other two with the 

 end of a needle, and they also moved slowly about. 



I did not again look into this nest until the following morning, when 

 I found the yellow ant dead, and carried to the rubbish pile. I then 

 introduced another ant of the same colony and of the same appearance, 

 but this second ant was no Svengali, and only the expected thereupon 

 happened. 



Yet another, introduced later, came in like manner to an immediate 

 and violent death. 



2. A wolf in sheep's clothing? 



I had in August, 1904, a nest of Cremastogaster Uneolata, containing 

 one queen, a hundred workers, and much young in the egg, larval and 

 pupal stages. These ants had been in my care during all their lifetimes, 

 and I know that they had never met Lasius lati'pes in active life. In 

 the previous June I had introduced into their nest a half-teaspoonful 

 of the larvse of Lasius lati'pes, for them to use as food, and this alien 

 larvae had been taken care of, had become pupse, and had gradually 

 disappeared. On August 21 there hatched from what was perhaps the 

 last of these alien pupse a tiny Lasius, that the Cremasiogasters per- 

 mitted to live. Its bright amber-yellow body was very conspicuous 

 among its jet-black associates. During several days the infant Lasius, 

 of a different subfamily from its foster-sisters, shared their labors and 

 passed unnoticed among them, and then it was nipped to death. 



It is probable that this Lasius, having been long among the Cremas- 

 iogasters, had acquired an overlaying of their inlierent odor, concealing 

 its own, and that it thereby escaped hostile attack until such time as it 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 641 



inherent odor became subject to the critical examination of an associate 

 or of the queen. Then instinctive race-prejudice impelled the Cremas- 

 iogastcrs to eliminate from their community one whose education had 

 already been such as to secure them from injury through her misbe- 

 havior. 



3. Can an ant remember acquaintances after lapse of tlircc years or 

 more? 



In August, 1904, I had a nest of Camponotus pefinsylvamcus, con- 

 taining some larvae and fourteen large workers, all of whom had hatched 

 in my nests between May 1 and May 10, and who were therefore about 

 three months old. They had spent the first two months of their lives 

 with Stenamma fulvum ants who were from seven to nine months old, 

 and they had not met ants of other species. They had been segregated 

 about one month, when I dropped into their nest two Formica lasiodes 

 of unknown age, several newly hatched Stenamma fulvum of the C 

 colony, two adult Stenamma fulvum of the X colony and two Stenam- 

 ma fulvum that were more than three years old, having been captured 

 as adults and kept three years in one of my artificial nests, a section of 

 the C colony. From the first introduction of these ants to the nest 

 of Camponotus, one of the three-year-old Stenammas, who was of the 

 same colony, as were the early acquaintances of Camponotus, went 

 freely and happily among them, apparently without fear and without 

 reproach. She was permitted to stand among or upon the cherished 

 larvae, or on the backs of the resident ants. The affiliation between 

 her and them was as complete as if she had always lived among them. 

 Her odor may have become familiar to them in the nest of Stenammas 

 where they had spent their early lives. But if this Stenamma had ever 

 been acquainted with Camponotus it was at a time previous to her resi- 

 dence in my artificial nests, and more than three years since she had 

 met any ant of other species than her own. The remarkable ease and 

 friendliness of her intercourse with these ants, among whom she was as 

 a brown pigmy among black bristly giants, is a fact requiring explana- 

 tion; and the only explanation offered by known characteristics of ants 

 lies in her recognition of an odor that she had previously encountered, 

 and that she recognized the odor after the lapse of more than three 

 years. 



All the other ants introduced at the same time as \\-as this Stenamma 

 were killed by the resident Camponotus within a few hours. The 

 Stenamma continued to live among the Camponotus until I removed 

 her at the end of eight days. 



The incidents were observed at the Marine iiiological Laboratory 

 at Wood's Hole. Massachusetts.

THE REACTIONS OF ANTS TO MATERIAL VIBRATIONS, 



BY ADELE M. FIELDE and GEORGE H. PARKER. 



While it is well established that some insects react to sound vibra- 

 tions that reach them through the air, and in this sense may be said to 

 hear, many competent authorities, such as Huber (1810), Ferris (1850), 

 Forel (1874, 1900), and Lubbock (1894), have admitted their inability 

 to bring to light any evidence that ants are thus stimulated. Even 

 the discovery of the so-called chordotonal organs in ants by Lubbock 

 (1894) and Janet (1894) has not led to positive results, so far as the 

 reactions of these animals to material vibrations are concerned, though 

 two American investigators. Weld (1899) and Metcalf (1900), have 

 claimed that ants are very sensitive to certain tones. 



Because of these somewhat conflicting opinions, it seemed to us de- 

 sirable to reinvestigate this question,^ and for this purpose we carried 

 out experiments on the following species of ants : 



Camponotine ants: 

 Camponotus pennsylvanicus (Deg,), workers; 

 Formica sanguinea Latr., queens and workers; 

 F. fusca L., var. suhsericea Say, queens and workers; 

 Lasius umbratus (Nyl.), queens and workers; 

 L. latipes (Walsh), workers. 



Myrmicine ants: 

 Stenamma fulvurn Roger, var. piceum Emery, queens and workers ; 

 Cremastogaster lineolata (Say), queens and workers. 



Ponerine ants: 

 Stigmatomma pallipes (Haldm.), workers. 



All these ants had lived more than a month in the artificial nests 

 in which they were tested. They had established their nest-odor, 

 had their young in charge and were well domesticated in their respec- 

 tive abodes. 



These ants were tested for two general classes of material vibrations : 

 first, those that reached them through the air surrounding them, and, 

 secondly, those from the solid base upon which the ants rested. 



* These investigations were made in the summer of 1903, at the Marine 

 Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Mass. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 643 



As sources for air vibrations we used a piano, a violin, and a Gallon 

 whistle. The keys of the piano gave us a range from 27 to 4176 vibra- 

 tions per second. The Galton whistle had a range from about 10,000 

 to about 60,000 vibrations per second, and was provided with a mova- 

 ble threaded core whereby any intermediate vibration could be ob- 

 tained. The range from the highest note of the piano, 4,176, to the 

 lowest one of the whistle, about 10,000, was bridged over by vibrations 

 obtained from the violin. Thus a series of vibrations from 27 to 60,000 

 per second were available for experimental purposes. 



In testing the ants with these vibrations the artificial nests were so 

 arranged that their au- was in free communication with the outer air 

 in which the vibrations were produced, but this was carried out in such 

 a way that draughts, to which ants are very sensitive, could not enter 

 the nests. The nests were placed upon thick paper, so as to isolate 

 them from \abrations that might reach them through the table upon 

 which they rested. The observer then closely watched a quiescent 

 ant under a hand magnifier, while a second person at several metres dis- 

 tance produced the vibrations as desired. As a rule, each key of the 

 piano was struck ten times in slow succession. If the ant under obser- 

 vation seemed to respond, it was given a resting period, and then re- 

 tested at the pitch to which it apparently reacted. The range of the 

 whistle, 10,000 to 60,000 vibrations, was divided into sixty intervals, 

 and these were treated as the keys of the piano, each note being blown 

 ten times while an ant was under observation. Ants were also watched 

 while the pitch of the whistle was gradually changed by slowly screwing 

 the core either in or out. A gradual change of pitch was also 

 produced on the violin. 



All the species mentioned as tested by us were subjected to this 

 range, 27 to 60,000 vibrations per second, and in no single instance 

 was any unquestionable reaction observed. Now and then an ant 

 would seem to respond to a given note, but in every case repetitions 

 of the experiment gave a negative result. We, therefore, conclude 

 that aerial vibrations between 27 and 60,000 per second give rise to 

 no observable responses in the ants we worked upon, and as these 

 included representatives of three subfamilies of the Formicidae, it is 

 highly probable that a like condition will be found among other ants. 



Our results, then, agree with those of Huber, Ferris, Forel and Lub- 

 bock, but are opposed to what is stated by Weld and by Metcalf. In 

 one instance we worked upon the same species as Weld, namely, 

 Cremastogaster lineolata, and tested it with a note approximately that 

 used by Weld (4,096 vibrations), but obtained from the piano and from 




644 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



the violin instead of from a metal bar. Nevertheless we got no reac- 

 tion. Weld docs not make clear that his ants were always isolated 

 from all except aerial vibrations, nor that their reactions were constant 

 under repeated .stimulation. It seems to us possible that his ants may 

 have reacted at times to vibrations of the solid base upon which they 

 rested and to which, as we shall show presently, they are very sensitive, 

 or their supposed reactions may have been accidental. Certainly our 

 own experimental evidence gives us not the least reason to suspect 

 that ants are stimulated by sound waves in air. 



Having reached this conclusion we next endeavored to ascertain 

 whether ants would respond to vibrations of the soHd base upon which 

 they stood. When a nest containing Stenamma fulvum was held in 

 the air within a centimetre or so of the woodwork of a piano, and the C, 

 giving 261 vibrations per second, was struck, no response followed. 

 When, however, the nest was allowed to rest on the woodwork and the 

 note was again sounded, almost all the ants started forward simul- 

 taneously. Thus a vibration that comes to an ant through the air 

 is not necessarily followed by a reaction, though the same vibration 

 when it reaches the ant through a solid may be very stimulating. All 

 the eight species of ants with which we experimented were thus stimu- 

 lated, though they failed to react to the same vibrations in the air. 

 The range of the different species was by no means uniform. All 

 reacted to the 27 vibrations per second and to higher notes up to a 

 certain pitch characteristic for each species. Cremastogaster reacted 

 at 522, but to no higher note. The superior limit for Formica jusca, 

 var. suhsericea wa,s 1,044, and for Lasius latipes and Stigmatomma 2,088. 

 Stenamma always reacted at 2,088, usually at 3,915, but failed at 4,176. 

 Camponotus regularly reacted at 3,480, but failed at 4,176. Formica 

 sanguinea, which invariably responded at 2,088, occasionally did so 

 at 4,176, a pitch regularly reacted to by Lasius umbratus. Thus each 

 species seemed to have a characteristic superior limit for stimulating 

 vil:)rations received through solids. 



Ants are not only sensitive to the tones of a piano transmitted 

 through a solid, but they are also sensitive to vibrations from other 

 sources similarly transmitted . This is well seen in the following experi- 

 ment on Stenamma. Wlien the edges of two Petri dishes were 

 rubbed against each other in the air, the ants did not respond; but 

 when the edge of the dish in which the ants were held was rubbed even 

 lightly by the edge of another dish, they reacted with great precision. 

 These reactions occurred even when the Petri dish containing the ants 

 was floating on water and the edge of the vessel containing the water 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 645 



was rubbed. Some idea of the delicacy of these reactions may be 

 gained from the fact that ants in a Petri dish resting on a pine table-top 

 reacted to the scratch of a pin on the table at a distance of ten feet 

 from the dish. A measure of the stimulus necessary to call forth the 

 most delicate reaction, usually a jerking movement of the antennae, was 

 obtained in the following way: A small' artificial nest was built on the 

 end of a long board clear of knots and, after the ants had become ac- 

 customed to their nest, stimuli were introduced by dropping a shot 

 weighing half a gram on the board at different distances from the nest 

 and from different heights. It was found that the ants reacted to a 

 blow given to the board 4.3 metres (14 feet) from the nest when the 

 shot fell from a height of 15 centimetres (6 inches), but that they did 

 not react when it fell through only half that distance. 



Ants not only react to material vibrations received through wood, 

 glass, water, etc., but they will also react to such vibrations when 

 resting on a bit of sponge in an artificial nest or on the soil in which they 

 construct their nests. Thus ants within their natural earth nests may 

 be stimulated by the vibrations of the material on which they stand, 

 though they will not respond to similar vibrations in the air about 

 them. 



To ascertain what parts of the body of the ant are concerned in its 

 reaction to the vibrations of non-gaseous materials, we performed 

 experiments on a number of individuals of Stenamma fulvum piceum 

 that had been deprived of portions of the body. 



All the mutilated ants, except those lacking heads or abdomens, had 

 undergone the necessary surgical operations so long as three or four 

 weeks previous to the experiments, and had therefore had time for 

 full recovery from shock-effects. 



The irritability of workers deprived of their funicles, or of the whole 

 of the antennae, was such as to make it necessary to isolate each in 

 order to prevent mutual slaughter, though all were of the same colony. 

 This irritability continued even after they had recovered from shock- 

 effect, had become alert and active, and had been more than a month 

 without funicles, or without both funicles and scapes. Queens similarly 

 mutilated were scarcely more irritable than when in normal condition, 

 and nearly all of the thirty operated upon survived the operation 

 more than two months and laid eggs. 



Queens and workers deprived of only one antenna were no more 

 irritable than normal ants, and hardly any deaths resulted from this 

 mutilation, while not more than twenty per cent, of the workers survived 

 the loss of either both funicles or both antennae.

[Sept., 



Queens and workers deprived of a pair of legs, the amputation being 

 made at the coxal joint (see figure), Hved in groups as amicably as 

 do whole ants, and there was little loss of life through this operation. 



The dehcate structure of the leg 

 manifestly renders it a probable com- 

 municator of "s-ibration from any solid 

 with which it might be in contact. 



There was throughout a direct 

 ratio between the degree of irritabil- 

 ity produced and the percentage of 

 deaths consequent upon the surgical 

 operations. The operations were as 

 far as possible carried out asepti- 

 cally and careful nursing was at- 

 tempted for all cases. 



The mutilated ants were tested 

 in Petri dishes, first by scratching 

 together in the air the edges of two 

 Petri dishes to ascertain whether 

 the ants were stimulated by air \dbra- 

 tions, and next by gently scratching 

 the edge of the dish in which the ants 

 were. As might be expected, no 

 reaction was ever obtained from 

 mutilated ants submitted to air 

 vibrations. The reaction of the ants 

 to the vibrations of the dish con- 

 taining them and the states of the 

 ants, so far as the operations that 

 they had undergone were concerned , 

 arc given in the following summary : 



1 . Queens from which both f unicles 

 had been removed "reacted by slight 

 locomotion, usually moving back- 

 "\^ard or side wise, rarely forward. 



2. Queens from which one antenna 

 had been removed reacted like 

 normal queens by forward, back- 

 ward or sidemse locomotion. 



3. Queens deprived of the whole of 

 both antennae reacted by moving 

 backward or sidewise.

 fulvum piceum. X 48.

4. Workers deprived of bqth funicles moved forward, backward or 

 turned side wise. 



5. Workers deprived of one antenna moved forward or turned side- 

 wise, as did the normal workers. 



6. Workers without antcnnse moved forward or backward or turned 

 side wise. 



It is thus evident that the antennae are not essential to the reactions 

 of these ants to vibrations from a solid, for the ants invariably reacted 

 irrespective of the conditions of the antennae, and the slight differences 

 in the nature of their reactions seem to us insignificant of the function 

 of hearing in parts removed. This opinion, that the antennae are not 

 essential to these reactions, is in accord with certain observations on 

 normal ants. When a normal ant in a Petri dish was resting with its 

 antennae high in air, it was observed to react vigorously to a slight 

 scraping on the edge of the dish, without, however, bringing the antennae 

 in contact with the dish. 



7. Decapitated queens and workers reacted by movements of the 

 legs, without, however, showing any determinate form of locomotion. 



8. Queens and w^orkers deprived of their abdomens reacted by 

 moving forward or sidewise. 



9. Queens deprived of any one pair of legs reacted by moving 

 forward, backward or sidewise. 



10. Workers deprived of any one pair of legs reacted by moving 

 forward or turning sidewise. 



11. Queens and workers deprived of any two pairs of legs reacted by 

 making ineffectual efforts to walk, their direction of locomotion being 

 very irregular. 



It is thus evident that the reactions of the ants to the vibrations of 

 the underlying solid are not dependent upon the antennae, head, abdo- 

 men, any pair or two pairs of legs. It seems to us probable that stimu- 

 lation is effected by the transfer of the vibration from the underlying 

 solid to the body of the ant, without reference to any special sense- 

 organ. That the various movements of the ants are true reactions, 

 and not merely motions transferred mechanically from the vibrating 

 base to the body of the ant, as to any small particle capable of \abrating, 

 is seen from the fact that the body of a dead ant does not show these 

 movements, and further that in a live ant these movements cease after 

 the stimulus has been repeated a few times, but begin again after the 

 ant has been allowed a resting period of at least ten minutes. 



In none of our experiments was there any evidence of a directive 

 influence exerted Ijy the stimulus on the movements of the ant. 




648 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



The observations and experiments recorded on the preceding pages 

 lead us to conclude that ants are insensitive to air vibrations, such as 

 are audible to us, and that they are very sensitive to the vibration of 

 the solid material upon which they stand, be this wood, glass, sponge 

 or the earth of their nests. These vibrations apparently affect their 

 whole bodies, reaching them through their legs or any other part in 

 contact with the solid base. It is of course conceivable that if an 

 air vibration were strong enough — i.e., if the sound were loud 

 enough — it might stimulate the body of the ant directly, but ap- 

 parently this is not usually the case; for, as we have already shown, 

 sounds of ordinary intensity, which call forth no response from the 

 ants when they reach these animals through the air, are very 

 effective as stimuli when they reach the animal from a solid 

 base. It therefore seems probable to us that ants in their nests are 

 stimulated, not by the sound waves in the air of the nest, bvit by the 

 vibrations of the solid parts of the nest itself. Hence the effectiveness 

 of a heavy footstep in the neighborhood of an anthill as contrasted with 

 the ineffectiveness of the human voice in causing an active emergence 

 of the ants. These animals are, as it were, in the condition of a per- 

 fectly deaf person who feels through his feet the vibrations caused by 

 a passing wagon, but cannot hear the sound it produces in the air. 

 This sensitiveness of the ants to the vibrations of the base upon which 

 they rest and their insensitiveness to air vibrations is exactly what 

 would be expected from the requirements of their subterranean life 

 as contrasted with that of aerial insects. 



Because of the analogy between the ants and a deaf person we do 

 not wish, however, to be understood to deny hearing to ants ; neither 

 do we affirm it. 



It has long been recognized by physiologists, if not by the scientific 

 public, that touch and hearing in the vertebrates are very closely 

 related. The apparent separateness of these senses in us is due to 

 the fact that the air waves by which our ears are visually stimulated 

 are too slight to affect our organs of touch. If, however, we transfer 

 our experiments to water, we at once meet with a medium in which, 

 as has long been known, vibrations can be both heard and felt. In 

 dealing with a like question among the lower animals it therefore seems 

 to us misleading to attempt to distinguish touch from hearing, and wc 

 shall be more within the bounds of accuracy if we discuss the question 

 from the standpoint of mechanical stimulation rather than attempt 

 to set up questionable distinctions based upon human sensations. 

 We therefore prefer to ignore the question of hearing in ants and to 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 649 



restate our conclusion in the form already given, that these animals are 

 insensitive to the ordinary vibrations of air, but are veiy sensitive to 

 the vibrations of the solid upon which they stand. 



It seems to us probable from our experiments that the material 

 vibrations that stimulate ants reach them in this way rather than 

 through the air. Janet (1893; 1896, p. 19) has described an ingenious 

 method whereby the stridulating of ants can be heard by the human 

 ear, and Wheeler (1903, p. 66) has been able to note a faint sound when 

 a large number of stridulating ants are collected in a bottle. Undoubt- 

 edly these stridulations are of ecologic importance to an ant community, 

 but it is our belief, based upon our experiments, that what can be heard 

 by the human ear through the air is probably not the Adbration that 

 affects the ants, but rather that the stridulation produces a vibration 

 of the solid constituents of the' nest, and that this vibration is the 

 effective one in stimulating the inmates. 



Summary. 



1. The ants experimented upon did not react to aerial sound waves 

 from a piano, violin, and Galton whistle, which collectively gave a range 

 from 27 to 60,000 vibrations per second. 



2. They reacted to most vibrations that reached them through the 

 wood, glass, sponge or nest-earth upon which they stood, though 

 different species seem to have different superior limits in respect to the 

 rate of the vibrations. 



3. These reactions are not dependent upon the funicles, the antennse, 

 the head, the abdomen, any pair or two pairs of legs of the ant, but are 

 usually received through the legs, and probably affect the body of the 

 ant as a whole. 



4. The stimulation of ants by the vibration of the solid u]:)on which 

 they stand, and not by the vibration of the surrounding air, accords 

 well with their subterranean life as contrasted with the aerial life of 

 most insects. 



5. It is misleading to ascribe or deny hearing to ants; they are very 

 sensitive to the vibration of solids, not to those of air ; their reactions 

 could be as appropriately described as resulting from touch as from 

 hearmg.

Several specimens, c? and 9 . It is related to the European species 

 lapidicola Mein., but is sufficiently distinct to warrant separation. In 

 the same collection were specimens of Lithohius provocator Poc, Mecis- 

 tocephalus guildingii Newp., and Julus moreleti Lucas, all previously 

 reported from this locality. 



Pectininnguis montereus sp. nov. 



Very similar in general appearance and structure to P. americanus 

 Boll., but readily separated from this as also from the other two previ- 

 ously described species by the fact that the anal legs are each armed 

 with a large claw. In plusiodontus Att. there is a mere vestige of a 

 claw, while in the other species there is no trace of one. 



The known species of this genus may be separated by means of the 

 following key: 



a. — Prebasal plate exposed, 



a\ — Anal legs armed with a claw montereus sp. nov. 



b'. — ^Anal legs unarmed, americanus Boll. 




654 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



b. — Prebasal plate not exposed. 



a'. — Ventral pores not existing on segments beyond the 28th; 



pleural pores absent, europoeus Attenis. 



b'. — Ventral pores on all plates from the first to the penult; pleural 



pores present, plusiodontus Attems. 



The specimens of montereus examined are, in alcohol, light brown 

 anteriorly and pale yellow posteriorly, the head being brown with the 

 frontal region lighter. The color seems to have faded in the alcohol 

 and in life was probably reddish. 



The two individuals have respectively 59 and 61 pairs of legs. They 

 arc very gradually though conspicuously attenuated anteriorly, and 

 strongly and rapidly attenuated posteriorly. 



The cephalic plate is longer than wide (6.4: 5.8) ; sides nearly straight 

 and but slightly converging caudad; the posterior angles well rounded; 

 posterior border truncate, not mesally at all incurved. 



Antenna3 moderate, the ultimate article distinctly shorter than the 

 two preceding together (1.5 : 2). 



Ventral pores and last ventral plate nearly as in americanus. 



Length of larger specimen 48 mm. 



Locality. — Pacific Grove, Bay of ]\Ionterey, California. 



Geophilus regnans sp. nov. 



Light brown, paler posteriorly. Body wide anteriorly, attenuated 

 gradually posteriorly. 



Head large. 



Cephalic plate attenuated in front of middle ; anterior border broadly 

 triangular; sides behind straight and subparallel; posterior margin 

 wide, a little incurved mesally. Frontal plate coalesced. Prebasal 

 plate exposed at the middle, the basal plate being a httle covered by 

 the cephalic laterally. Basal plate thrice wider than long. 



Claws of prehensorial feet when closed not attaining the front margin 

 of head ; presternum in front widely angularly emarginate, unarmed ; 

 all joints and the claw unarmed. 



Antennae very short, subsparsely pilose; the ultimate article about 

 equalhng in length the two preceding together. 



Sulci of dorsal scuta not deep. 



Anterior spiracles oval, oblique, the first few large, the others gradu- 

 ally decreasing; median and posterior spiracles circular, small. 



Last ventral plate very wide, its sides convexly curving, moderately 

 converging posteriorly; posterior margin wide, gently incurved. Last 

 pleurse moderate in size; pores entirely covered by the ventral plate, 

 few, small. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 655 



Anal legs stouter and much longer than the penult, armed with a 

 long, stout claw; like the other legs, almost destitute of hair. 



Pairs of legs 79-81. 



Locality. — Southern California (Los Angeles, etc.). 



I am inclined to think this species the Strigamia cephalica of Wood. 

 But it is realh^ a Geophilus, and a new name must under any conditions 

 be given to it, as the name cephaliciis was previously given by Wood to 

 another species in this genus. 



Geophilus cayugae sp. nov. 



Body little attenuated anteriorly, strongly attenuated posteriorly. 



Cephalic plate with anterior and posterior margins truncate ; angles 

 well rounded; sides nearly straight, subparallel; longer than wide 

 (7.4 : 6.7). Frontal plate not distinctly separated. Basal plate two 

 and a half times wider than long. 



Claws of prehensorial feet when closed barely reaching the front 

 margin of head ; presternum with chitinous lines, front margin widely 

 angularly emarginate, unarmed; femur and claw also unarmed. 



First two spiracles large, subcircular, those following circular, gradu- 

 ally decreasing in size caudad, the last very small. 



Last ventral plate rather narrow; sides straight, converging pos- 

 teriorl^^ Last coxse enlarged, covered over entire exposed surface, 

 except posteriorly, with large and small pores, of which there are 30 or 

 more on each side. 



Anal pores distinct, of moderate size. 



First pair of legs much smaller and more slender than those following, 

 the second pair somewhat intermediate in size. Anal legs stouter and 

 much longer than the penult, each armed with a very long and slender 

 claw. 



Pairs of legs 65 ( 9 ). Length 55 mm. 



Locality. — Ithaca, New York. 



Evidently close to lanius Brol. In cayugce, however, the anal pores 

 are conspicuous, not concealed (absent?) as in lanius. Also the an- 

 tennae are relatively much shorter than in lanius, the cephalic plate is 

 of a different shape, the number of pleural pores is much larger and 

 cover the pleurse above as well as below and laterally, and the pairs of 

 legs number 65 ( 9 ) as against 57 ( 9 ) in lanius. 

 Mecistocephalus anomalus sp. nov. 



Body and legs waxy yellow; head pale, somewhat reddish brown; 

 antennse pale yellowish brown. 



Gradually attenuated from the head caudally. 



Cephalic plate longer than wide in ratio of 7 :4.75; strongly nar- 




656 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept. 



rowed caudally, posterior margin truncate. Basal plate moderately 

 narrowed, wider anteriorly than long in ratio of 3 : 2 ; pleurse exposed 

 in usual manner. 



Antennae not attenuated distally, all articles excepting ultimate 

 obconic; ultimate article a little shorter than the two preceding 

 together; length 3.2 mm. 



Claws of prehensorial feet when closed reaching but slightly beyond 

 front margin of head; presternal teeth pale, obtuse; median furrow 

 of presternum wide, shallow, not well marked posteriorly; femora with 

 a stout, blunt black tooth, the next two joints with small, black 

 tubercle-like teeth, the claws wdth an acute tooth. 



Anterior prgescuta short but all distinctly exposed, the median and 

 posterior ones long. A number of anterior dorsal scuta with a distinct 

 median sulcus between the two lateral sulci. 



The anterior ventral scuta with a deep median sulcus which does 

 not attain the margin. 



Anterior spiracle large, oval, subvertical, the second and third of 

 similar form but smaller, those following circular, rapidly decreasing 

 in size, those of the middle and posterior region being very small. 



Last ventral plate wide, strongly narrowed caudally, the sides 

 straight. Last pleurae inflated, haidng along the edge of the ventral 

 plate on each side a row of 4 or 5 very small pores and at a distance on 

 middle part a clearly larger isolated single pore. 



Anal pore moderate. 



First pair of legs much shorter and more slender than the second. 

 Anal legs stouter and much longer than the penult pair. 



Pairs of legs 41( !). Length 22 mm. ; width 1 mm. 



Locality. — Pacific Grove, California. 



One male. 



This species cannot well be identified with the M. limatus of Wood, 

 which is apparently a much larger form. Aside from other minor 

 differences more or less uncertainly indicated by Wood's description, 

 the number of legs of limatus is given as "43-44," indicating that sev- 

 eral specimens were examined. The number 44 is, of course, an error; 

 but it is practically certain that the number of pairs of legs, which so 

 far as known is absolutely fixed for each species in this genus, was 43, 

 and not the unusual number 4L 

 Linotsenia rubelliana sp- nov. 



Color in life bright red, fading in alcohol to a uniform brown, the 

 antennae alone remaining somewhat brighter. 



Cephalic plate narrowed anteriorly, in front subnarrowly rounded, 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 657 



behind widely truncate. Frontal plate clearly separated. Prebasal 

 plate well exposed. Basal plate twice wider than long, with no indi- 

 cation of a median furrow. 



Antennae short, attenuated distally, the ultimate joint little shorter 

 than the two preceding together; all articles sparsely hirsute with 

 short fine hairs. 



Claws of prehensorial feet when closed falling much short of the 

 front of the head; femora unarmed; tooth of claw large, acute; front 

 margin of presternum deeply excavated. 



All ventral scuta marked with a distinct median furrow, from the 

 posterior end of which extends outward over each half to the sides a 

 shallow oval impression in front of the posterior margin. 



Anterior spiracle moderate, a little elongate subvertically, the second 

 similarly shaped and but little smaller; others circular, very gradually 

 decreasing in size caudally. 



Last ventral plate very wide; sides convexly rounded, strongly 

 converging caudally. 



Last pleurae much enlarged; pores serially arranged along and be- 

 neath the last ventral plate. 



Anterior pair of legs distinctly shorter and more slender, the legs 

 regularly increasing in size from the first to about the sixth pair. 



Anal pair of legs scarcely shorter than the penult, a little more slen- 

 der, armed with a claw. 



Pairs of legs 71-75. Length 60-82 mm.; width of largest specimen 

 2.2 mm. Length of antennae of largest specimen 4 mm. 



Locality. — Pacific Grove and Palo Alto, California. 



This large and handsome species cannot be the form described by 

 Wood under the name epileptica from an individual captured near 

 Puget's Sound. The latter species is apparently much more like m- 

 perialis Brol., the type of which comes from near the same locality. 

 According to the published descriptions and figures, these species agree 

 with each other and differ from rubeUiana, among other points, in 

 having the prebasal plate covered and in the larger number of legs 

 (81-83 pairs).

BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



The material treated in the following pages is contained in the 

 collections of the Academy, the United States National Museum and 

 of Mr. Morgan Hebard, of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. The material 

 studied consisted of two hundred and twenty-seven specimens, repre- 

 senting forty-six species and thirty-one genera, of which one genus and 

 twelve species are described as new. The author wishes to thank Dr. 

 W. H. Ashmead, of the U. S. National Museum, and Mr. Hebard for 

 their kindness in permitting the use of material. 



Subfamily ACRYDIIN.E (Tettigince auct.). 



Section Oladcnotae. 



DASYLEUROTETTIX i n. gen. 



Allied to Diotarus and Trachytettix Stal, but differing from the former 

 in the presence of tegmina and wings, the rugulose vertex, deplanate 

 and scabrous pronotum, and the truncate character of the cephalic 

 margin of the same. From Trachytettix it is separated by the form of 

 the antennee, the unspined vertex, the longer cephalic femora and the 

 position of the antennae. 



Form depressed, subquadratc in transverse section at the hmneral 

 an^le ; sm-face scabrous. Facial scutellum with a V-shaped longitudi- 

 nal excavation, carinae distinct, subparallel; antennae placed against 

 the carinae of the facial scutellum and distant from the e^^es, apex of 

 width equal to the remainder of the appendage, vertex broad, about 

 twice the width of one of the eyes. Pronotum truncate cephalad, pro- 

 duced caudad beyond the tips of the caudal femora; humeral angle 

 prominent. Cephalic femora nearly three times as long as wide. 

 Caudal femora heavy and with the paginae moderately sculptiu-ed. 

 Po3 terior metatarsi distinctly longer than the third tarsal joints.

cate and without a distinct frontal carina; median carina of the vertex 

 low, slightly projecting ccphalad; facial scutellum longitudinal, sub- 

 parallel, the margins arcuate and the costa distinctly sinuate above 

 and below; antcnnse inserted on a level with the ventral margin of 

 the eyes, placed against the facial scutellum, when extended caudad 

 reaching to the humeral angle of the pronotum; eyes subpja'iform in 

 outline, moderately prominent. Pronotum strongly depressed, arcuate 

 cephalad, closely and uniformly scabrous, obscurely lineato-rugose ; 

 cephalic margin truncate; humeral angles broad, extended, depressed; 

 lateral lobes with the elytral sinus moderately deep, inferior sinus deep 

 and acute, caudal angle produced and apically truncate; lateral 

 carina scabro-denticulate, obsolete cephalad of the humeral angles; 

 median carina depressed, arcuate cephalad, caudad of the hvimeral 

 angles irregularly undulate; caudal process long, subulate, extending 

 caudad of the tips of the caudal femora. Tegmina cylindrical ovate, 

 the surface finel}- tubercidate. Wings large, extending slightly beyond 

 the apex of the caudal process of the pronotum. Ovipositor valves of 

 the female rather short, thick, serrato-dentate. Cephalic femora mod- 

 erately undulate dorsad and ventrad. Median femora undulate dor- 

 sad, trilobate ventrad. Caudal femora short, inflated, femoral lobe 

 short and thick, dorsal carina with several subobsolete points, ventral 

 carina with several subobsolete lobes, external pagina and dorso-lateral 

 face decorated with strong diagonal scabrous ridges; tibiae strongly 

 spined, the canthi minutely serrate; metatarsi slightly exceeding the 

 remaining tarsal joints in length, pulvilli subequal in length. 



General color bistre, the wings with the cephalic margin and a large 

 rounded spot covering the great part of the wing mummy brown, 

 median limbs barred with cinnamon, caudal limbs more or less regu- 

 larly blotched with obscure cinnamon. 



Measurements. 



Length of body, 10.7 mm. 12 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 12.5 " 13 " 



Greatest width of pronotum, 4.8 " 5.2 " 



Length of posterior femora, 6.5 " 7 " 



This curious genus and species is represented by a series of five males 

 and nine females, all of which are from Mount Coffee. Little variation 

 is exhibited by the series, a slight difference in the intensity of the 

 scabrous character of the pronotum being all that is noteworthy. I 

 take pleasure in dedicating this species to my friend Mr. Rolla P. 

 Currie, of the U. S. National Museum, who collected the types.

Mount Coffee, Liberia. April, 1897. (R. P. Currie). [U. S. N. M.] 

 Three females. 



These individuals seem to agree very well with Bolivar's description 

 except that they are somewhat larger. Two of the three specimens 

 have the caudal process of the pronotum produced, the remaining indi- 

 vidual having the caudal femora hardly exceeded by the pronotum. 

 These two individuals possess well-developed wings, which extend 

 beyond the process of the pronotum. 



The genus Pantelia includes three species: P. horrendus (Walker^)

 median boss in the interhumeral region, two series of paired protuber- 

 ances placed caudad; caudal process extending beyond the caudal 

 femora a distance equal to their length. Tegmina elongate, acuminate , 

 apex narrowly rounded, surface coarsely reticulate. Wings reaching to 

 the tip of pronotal process. Cephalic femora with the carinse undulate. 

 Median femora slenderer than the cephalic and with the carinse undu- 

 late. Caudal femora rather slender, sparsely granulate, carinse not 

 undulate or dentate, femoral lobe low and subobsolete, external pagina 

 and dorso-lateral face mth strong obhque sculpture; tibiae with the 

 margins expanded, lamellate, unarmed but very finely serrate; meta- 

 tarsi about half again as long as the remaining tarsal joints. 



General color bistre, obscm-cly marked on the lateral carinse and the 

 pronotal spines with ferruginous. Cephalic and median limbs with 

 several obscm-e bands of wood brown. Caudal tai-si, margins and 

 proximal portions of the tibise and two obscure bands on the dorsal 

 aspect of the femora wood brown.

 and from these two species it can readily be distinguished by the 

 greater size and acute caudal process of the pronotum. 



Size medium; form depressed; surface scabrous. Head with the 

 occiput not elevated above the level of the pronotum; vertex truncate, 

 about equal to one of the eyes in width, median carina projecting con- 

 siderably beyond the cephalic margin, lateral carina? distinct but by 

 no means as apparent as the median, no frontal carina present; frontal 

 costa forked slightly above the ocelli, rami considerably divergent, 

 moderately arcuate when viewed laterad and sinuate doread; antennae 

 inserted on a level with the ventral margin of the eyes; median ocellus 

 placed distinctly ventrad of the antennse, paired ocelli placed between 

 the middle of the eyes; eyes subovoid, moderately prominent. Pro- 

 notum depressed above, subconcave; cephalic margin very broadly 

 and obtusely angulate; humeral angle not prominent; caudal process 

 not exceeding the apex of the abdomen and not reaching the tips of 

 the caudal femora, gradually acuminate to a short distance from the 

 apex where it becomes sharply acuminate with the apex hastate and 

 slightly subulate ; posterior angle of the lateral lobes moderately pro- 

 duced and rectangularly extended when viewed dorsad, apically trun- 

 cate, inferior sinus rectangulate, elytral sinus represented by a very 

 slight emargination; median carina slight, cephalad of the humeral 

 angles very slightly arcuate and elevated, undulate caudad; lateral 

 carinse obsolete cephalad, arcuate caudad of the humeral angles. No 

 tegmina or wings present. Cephalic and median femora not appreci- 

 ably undulate. Caudal femora short, strongly inflated, dorsal and 

 ventral margins evenly arcuate, femoral lobe short, blunt, external 

 pagina and dorso-lateral face with distinct but rather low sculpture; 

 tibia well supplied with low blunt spines, canthi sparsely and weakly 

 serrulate; metatarsi equal to the third tarsal joint in length, pulvilli 

 low.

Carrillo, Costa Rica. [Hebard Coll.] One immature male. 



This individual presents several characters which are more or less 

 at variance with Morse's figure, the head being more compressed and 

 with the carinse of the vertex developed into distinct erect processes, 

 and the median carina of the pronotum has but two distinct undulations. 

 As the specimen is immature these differences in all probability are 

 due to the stage of the insect.

Differing from either of the previously known species of the genus 

 in the unarmed margins of the cephaHc process, and in the smaller 

 size. The generic diagnosis given by Bolivar will require some modi- 

 fication to include this form, as the antennae are inserted between the 

 eyes and the metatarsi of the caudal limbs are distinctly longer than 

 the third tarsal joint. 



Size rather small; form elongate; sm-face finely granulose. Head 

 with the cephalic process produced a distance before the eyes equal 

 to the greatest length of one of the latter, depressed dorsad, acute, the 

 apex rounded, margins entire and carinate, median carina distinct; 

 face distinctly declivent; frontal costa forked slightly cephalad of the 

 ocelli; rami slightly divergent; median ocellus inserted on a level with 

 the ventral margin of the eyes, paired ocelli placed directly between 

 the eye; eyes subtrigonal, hardly prominent; antennse short, very 

 slender, apex acute, inserted directly between the eyes and equi- 

 distant from them and the frontal costa. Pronotum slender, very 

 elongate, caudal process extending beyond the tips of the caudal 

 femora a distance about equal to their length, very slightly subu- 

 late; cephalic margin very broadly obtuse-angulate ; dorsum slightly 

 arched transversely; median and lateral carinse distinct, the inter- 

 humeral region bearing a pair of short accessory carinas placed on 

 each side of the median carina; lateral lobes wdth the posterior angle 

 acute, inferior sinus rectangulate, elytral sinus slight. Tegmina 

 cylindrical ovate. Wings extending slightly beyond the apex of the 

 caudal process of the pronotum. Cephalic and median femora with 

 their margins very slightly undulate. Caudal femora slender, margins 

 evenly curved, genicular spine distinct and acute, femoral lobe distinct, 

 external pagina with distinct but irregular diamond-shaped sculpture; 

 tibiae slightly sinuate, armed apically with distinct spines, canthi 

 minutely serrulate; metatarsi equal to the remaining tarsal joints in

These specimens fully agree mth Bolivar's description, except that 

 the pagina of the caudal limbs are elevated into plicate ridges as in 

 lohulatus. From lohulatus, however, they differ in the partially hidden 

 teginina, the sinuate ventro-caudal margins of the pronotum and the 

 more apparent median carina. As the original description was based 

 on a female these specimens are materially smaller than the measure-

This species has been recorded from Burma by Brunner,^ and if he

 far as the character of the median femora goes, the specimens men-

 have the median femora heavier and with the carinse more arcuate 

 than in the cephalic pair. The cephalic margin of the pronotum is

ters of the cerci and the coloration of the hmbs, however, place it in 

 magna, the aljsence of the facial decoration in Burr's species possibly 

 being due to the fact that his specimens were from Mexico, and for that 

 reason representing another species. As far as can be made from 

 Gigho-Tos' diagnosis of the female this specimen is his species,

The female specimen agrees very well with the original description, 

 except that the size is slightly less. The subgenital plate of the male 

 is more produced and acute than in tigris, while the fastigium is more 

 distinctly truncate, wdth a very slight median emargination which is 

 more apparent in the male than in the female. The orange maculation 

 on the dorsal surface involves two segments in the male instead of one 

 as in the female, and the lateral lobes of the pronotum are subequal in 

 depth, not produced ventrad as seen in M. tigris.

Luebo, Congo. (D. W. Snyder.) [U. S. Nat. Mus.] One male,

As far as can be determined from Karsch's rather meagre descrip- 

 tion of a female, the above specimens represent his species. Differ- 

 ence is noted in the unicoloroiis face, the limbs, however, being suffused 

 with blackish, which is limited on the caudal femora to the distal half. 

 The male is gaily colored as in T. zebra and is but slightly smaller, but 

 the gense are solid yellow^ish from the eye down, the caudal margin of 

 the lateral lobes of the pronotum are more broadly yellowish than the 

 cephalic, the ventral margin is blackish, and the lateral aspect of 

 the proximal abdominal segments are almost solid black. The apex 

 of the male abdomen is strongly clavate, recurved and directed cepha- 

 lad; the subgenital plate is inflated, subcylindrical, elongate; cerci 

 simple, styliform, hidden under the subgenital plate.

*^ This condition may be due to the artificial compressing of the abdomen, 

 but it is ver\' evident tliat the width is by no means as great as in the female of

This specimen is equal to Burmeister's and Brunner's maximum 

 measurements and is considerably larger than two individuals of the 

 same sex from Carcarana, Argentina, in the collection of the Academy. 

 The Sapucay specimen, also, has the rostrum longer than in Burmeis-

Closely allied to C. costulata but differing in the longer and subequal 

 rostrum, the more marked longitudinal strigse and the heavier antennae. 



Size medium ; surface of the body with distinct longitudinal strigae, 

 weaker on the pronotum than elsewhere. Head elongate, tapering; 

 rostrum of the male about equal to the length of the head, of the female 

 slightly longer than the remainder of the head, tapering in the male 

 with a rather blunt apex, subequal in the female, apex rather blunt 

 and subcruciform when \'iewed cephalad; antennae equal to the ros- 

 trum in the male, about two-thirds the length in the female, basal 

 joint slightly less than half the length of the eye; eyes subelliptical ; 

 face very slightly concave. Pronotum elongate, slightly broader 

 caudad than cephalad, limbs inserted very slightly caudad of the

It does away completely with the heretofore unnecessary gearing 

 required for the revolutions, this being accomplished by a double 

 rotating motion produced by the twisting of rawhides or rope. Tliis 

 to-and-fro motion gives a more level precipitation, and the magnifying 

 bulbous end of the graduated bottle enables a measurement of the 

 smallest amounts of precipitate. The bottles are tightly corked, tims 

 preventing the mixture of the precipitate with the supernatant liquid, 

 and serving as a safeguard in revohang infectious material.

I. — Introductory and Historical, 



The phylogenetic relationships of Dinophilus have presented a per- 

 plexing problem to morphologists since the establishment of the genus 

 by Oscar Schmidt in 1848. The various views as to its systematic 

 position may be conveniently classed under three heads: (1) those 

 referring Dinophilus to the Turbella ia; (2) those referring it to the 




688 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Nemertina, and (3) those referring it to the Annelida, or to some 

 position intermediate between the annelids and the rotifers. The older 

 writers, with the exception of van Beneden, referred the genus to the 

 Turbellaria, on account of its ob\aous external resemblances to that 

 group. Among these authors may be mentioned Schmidt (1848) (who, 

 however, later changed his opinion). Max Schultze (1849), Diesing 

 (1874), Mereschkowsky (1879), Korschelt, in his first paper on Dino- 

 philus (1882), and Weldon (1886). 



In 1861 van Beneden described a species from the coast at Ostende, 

 and referred the genus to the nemerteans, principally, it would seem, 

 on account of the character afforded in the possession of a proboscis. 

 Of recent wTiters who have inchned to this opinion we have only 

 Verrill (1895), who, however, does not enter into a discussion of the 

 relationships of the group, but only pro\"isionally refers it to the 

 nemerteans. 



The first to place Dino'philus among the annelids was Schmarda 

 (1861), who described a species from the coast of South America, and 

 assigned it to a place in the Oligochsete family of the Naidae, next to 

 the primitive genus Mlosoma. The claims of Dino'philus to a place 

 among the annehds have, however, been based chiefly on its remark- 

 able resemblance to certain annelid larvse, especially those of the poly- 

 trochal type. The first to call attention to this fact was ]\Ietschnikoff 

 (1866), who in his paper on Apsilus vrrote concerning the systematic 

 position of Dinophilus: "Dass Dinophilus als eine stationare Anneliden- 

 larva zu betracten ist, und mithin zu der Anneliden ebenso xde Appen- 

 dicularia zu den Ascidien sich verhalt." He also notices some resem- 

 blances to certain rotifers. As a cm-ious parallel to this \^ew may be 

 cited Oscar Schmidt's (1882) comparison of the position of Dinophilus 

 among the annelids to that of Axolotl among the true salamanders. 



Graff (1882), in his fine monograph on the Turbellaria, removes 

 Dinophilus from the Turbellaria, and considers it as more properly 

 belonging near the Annelida. 



Lang (1884) places Dinophilus in the line which leads through the 

 Archiannelida to the rotifers. Harmer (1889) also regards Dinophilus 

 as nearl}^ related to the Archiannelida; Repiachoff (1886) considers it 

 a true annelid, as does Korschelt (1893); while of the most recent 

 WTiters Schimkewitsch (1895) considers Dinophilus as affording char- 

 acters which relate it to both the rotifers and annelids. 



These various \dews have been based almost entirely on anatomi- 

 cal evidence, since but three papers deal with the embryology, ^dz.: 

 Korschelt (1882), Repiachoff (1886) and Schmike^ntsch (1895). 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 689 



Ivorschelt studied the living egg and described the manner in which 

 the eggs were laid, the early stages of the cleavage, an epibolic gastrula- 

 tion, and observed that at hatching the young Dinophilus closely 

 resembles the adult. Repiachoff's paper is more complete as regards 

 the embryolog}', giving numerous figures of the cleavage and sections 

 of the gastrula. Two important discoveries are to be attributed to 

 this investigator, viz. : That the mesoderm arises from a pair of meso- 

 blast cells situated posterior to the blastopore, and that a considerable 

 portion of the ectoderm of the adult arises from a pair of large cells 

 situated at the posterior end of the embryo and derived from the largest 

 cell of the 4-cell stage. Schimkewitsch follows along the same lines 

 as Repiachoff, and does little more than confirm the latter's results, 

 though the figures given by Schimkewitsch are much in advance of 

 those given b}^ Repiachoff. These authors, Korschelt, Repiachoff 

 and Schimkemtsch, attempted to compare the cleavage of the Dino- 

 philus ovum with that of the rotifers and consequently failed to prop- 

 erly interpret it. 



In view of the fact that so little is at present known concerning the 

 early development of this form, the evidence as to its relationships 

 being principally anatomical, it has seemed highly desirable to study 

 the embryology thoroughly, from the earliest cleavage on. 



The present paper is concerned almost wholly with the cell-lineage. 

 This has been done for two reasons : first, because such a careful studj^ 

 of the cleavage as is involved in a study of the cell-lineage gives a firm 

 and secure basis for work on the later development; and second, 

 because the study of the cell-lineage of mollusks and annelids has 

 brought to light such striking resemblances that there can scarcely 

 be any doubt that they are of phylogenetic significance. 



II. — Material and Methods. 



The species of Dinophilus with which this paper is concerned has 

 not been determined with certainty. Both sexes correspond closely 

 to the description given by Korschelt (1882) for the species found by 

 him in aquaria at Freiburg, and named by him Dinophilus apatris. 

 Repiachoff (1886) has supposed that this species is identical with D. 

 gyrociliatus 0. Schmidt. The individuals of the species found in the 

 aquaria at the University of Pennsylvania agree with D. apatris, anrl 

 differ from D. gyrociliatus in lacking the last or perianal circle of cilia, 

 and also appear to differ from D. gyrociliatus in another important 

 respect, i.e., in having no segmental orgaas, E. Meyer (1887) figured 

 for the females of D. gyrociliatus fi\'o pairs of ncphridia of the type found 




690 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



in annelid larvae (protoncphridia). Careful study of fixed and living 

 material has thus far afforded me no evidence whatever of nephridia 

 of any sort. 



The ova which were studied in the preparation of this paper were 

 collected from the sea-water aquaria in the vivarium of the University 

 of Pennsylvania during the months of January to May, 1902. 



The ova are laid in gelatinous capsules as described by Korschelt for 

 D. apatris, each capsule containing three to seven ova of two sizes, the 

 smaller about one-third the diameter of the larger. The smaller ova 

 give rise to the minute and degenerate males, while the larger ova 

 give rise to the female individuals. The number of the large female 

 ova exceeds that of the male. In fifty capsules 214 ova were counted, 

 of which number 79 were male ova and 135 female. These latter have 

 been the object of my investigation, the small size (ca. 30 micra in 

 diameter) and smaller number of the male ova rendering them much 

 less favorable for study. The capsules were found attached to the 

 various sea-weeds in the aquaria, and particularly to the Ulva. A 

 quantity of the sea-weed was taken from the tanks in which the animals 

 were found to be most abundant and squeezed over a large watch 

 crystal. The eggs thus washed out from their capsules, together with 

 much vegetable debris, soon settled to the bottom of the watch crystal, 

 from which they were picked out, under a lens, by means of a fine- 

 pointed pipette and transferred to a small vessel. The vessel found 

 most useful for this purpose was made from the hemispherical bottom 

 of a small test-tube cemented to a slide. The ova collected in this 

 manner proved to be in all stages of development, from the unseg- 

 mented ovum to an embryo ready to escape. 



The ova were in all cases killed with Kleinenberg's stronger picro- 

 sulphuric fluid, and after washing in 70 per cent, alcohol, were stained 

 with Conklin's (1902) picrohsematoxylin. This method of fixing and 

 staining has proved satisfactory with so many forms that it was con- 

 sidered advisable, in view of the scarcity of the, material, not to experi- 

 ment further. The ova were then dehydrated, cleared in cedar oil 

 or xylol, and mounted in balsam under covers supported by thin glass 

 feet, thus providing a space in which the eggs may be rolled about by 

 displacing the cover glass. 



It has been noted by several observers that Dinophilus practically 

 disappears at the approach of warm weather, and this fact was found 

 to be true in this case also. This is interpreted by Korschelt to mean 

 simply that the period of sexual activity has come to an end. How- 

 ever, species of Dinophilus have been found at Wood's Hole, Massachu- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 691 



setts, during the summer months by Verrill (1895) and by Miss Moore 

 (1899), so that it would appear that some few individuals lived over 

 the summer. 



The animals found in the aquaria were probably imported on sea- 

 weed gathered at Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, or at Sea Isle, N. J., 

 and owing to the favorable conditions afforded by the aquaria they 

 multiplied and became abundant During the past three seasons, 

 however, Dinophilus has not become abundant until late in the autumn 

 or in the early winter. The largest number of ova were gathered in 

 January and February, the number diminishing from that time, until 

 by May their number was so small that it did not pay to collect them. 

 During the past three years the animals have nearly all disappeared 

 by the middle of June.

Ill . — Nomenclature . 



The nomenclature adopted in this paper is that modification of 

 Wilson's system (1892) used by Conklin (1897), with the further modi- 

 fication adopted by Child (1900) in prefixing coefficients to the macro- 

 meres, as well as to the micromeres. The macromeres are designated 

 by capitals, the micromeres by small letters. 



When the cleavage plane of two cells approximates the direction 

 of the loxodromic curve shown in text fig, I, A, it is dcxiotropic ; when 

 it approximates the direction of that shown in text fig. I, B, it is 

 leiotropic. 



The number of the quartette is indicated by a coeflficient. Thus 1 a 

 is the member of the first quartette located in the A quadrant. The 




692 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



product of a division which lies toward the animal pole receives the 

 exponent 1, that toward the vegetal pole the exponent 2. Thus la^ 

 lies nearer the animal pole than la^. If the cleavage is meridional 

 the right cell, as seen by an imaginary observer located at the animal 

 pole, receives the larger exponent. Thus la*-^ lies to the right of la^-. 



The macromeres receive a coefficient corresponding to the number 

 of the quartette to which they last contributed. Thus 4 A last gave 

 rise to 4a. 



When cells arise whose origin and fate are similar to those of annelids 

 or mollusks which have already received special names, as, for example, 

 the " trochoblasts " or the ''intermediate girdle cells," I have made 

 use of these names. I do not, however, wish to imply that the cells 

 are necessarily homologous with those to which these names were first 

 applied. 



The animal pole is that point at which the polar bodies are given 

 off, the point opposite is the vegetal pole. 



IV. — History of the Cleavage. 

 (1) Un segmented Ovum. 



^ly observations on the unsegmented ovum have unfortunately been 

 confined entirely to fixed and stained material. Since in each lot of 

 material all stages were found, from the unsegmented ovum to the 

 larva about to hatch, a considerable amount of time and labor would 

 have been involved and many ova lost in selecting for study the few 

 which were still in an unsegmented condition. The ova are approxi- 

 mately spherical and not elongated in one dimension, as Korschelt 

 describes them in D. apatris. Measurements of the diameters of six 

 unsegmented eggs were respectively 108 micra, 100 micra, 90 micra, 

 96 micra, 92 micra and 100 micra, giving as the average diameter of 

 the egg 97.66 micra. These measurements nearly approach those 

 given by Korschelt for D. apatris, i.e., Ill micra x 92 micra. 



Closely smTounding the ovum is a delicate wrinkled vitelline mem- 

 brane. The protoplasm in the living ovum is nearly opaque, this 

 opacity being due to the presence of minute dcutoplasmic spheres uni- 

 formly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These deutoplasmic 

 spheres give to the stained and mounted ova a darkly granular appear- 

 ance, which in many cases makes both mitotic figures and cell outlines 

 difficult to distinguish. Fig. 1^ shows the ovum just after the extrusion 

 of the second polar body. The latter is spherical in shape and about 

 half as large as the first polar body, which is somewhat ovoid. In 

 the first polar body a faint nucleus can be made out, but none in the 



iSee Plates XLIII-XLVIII. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 693 



second. Neither of them have been seen to divide. The polar bodies 

 in Dinophilus, as in all animals, mark the animal pole, but arc, however, 

 not a reliable means of orienting the later stages, since through some 

 cause they tend to become displaced and are ultimately taken into the 

 cells over which they happen to lie. In fig. 8, for example, the first 

 polar body is already sinking into the cell Ic, while the second is still 

 free. 



In fig. 1, beneath the polar bodies lies the female pronucleus, formed 

 of four nuclear vesicles, each vesicle resembling a small nucleus in 

 appearance, having a distinct bounding membrane and containing 

 small granules of chromatin of varying sizes. Below the vesicles, and 

 comaimng them as in a cup, is a large hemispherical aster. Somewhat 

 below and to the right of the center of the ovum lies the male pro- 

 nucleus with its accompanjdng aster, which lies on the vegetal pole 

 side of the nucleus. 



The stage next studied is represented in fig. 2, where the two pro- 

 nuclei are seen to h&ve come together. The male pronucleus is prob- 

 ably the large bilobed vesicle which lies on the side of the nucleus 

 toward the vegetal pole ; the female pronucleus is probably represented 

 by the eight smaller vesicles on the other side. The ovum is in the 

 early prophase of division, a large and deeply staining aster being on 

 each side of the nucleus, though no spindle fibres can yet be distin- 

 guished. 



(2) Primary Cleavages. 1-4 Cells. 



The spindle for the first cleavage is shown in fig. 3. The cell bod}- 

 has elongated and the spindle is in the anaphase, while the unequal 

 character of this cleavage is clearly indicated by the inequality in the 

 diameter of the two asters as well as by the eccentric position of the 

 spindle. The spindle is inclined at a slight angle to the horizontal 

 plane, the end which is to form the smaller cell being the lower. The 

 explanation of this is not clear; possibly the spindle was oscillating, 

 or perhaps the position of the spindle may have something to do with 

 the beginning of spiral cleavage. Unfortunately this is the only ovum 

 which I have seen in which the spindle is in either metaphase or ana- 

 phase, so that it is not aljsolutely certain that this oblique position is 

 normal. The plane of this division passes through the animal pole, 

 but lies to one side of the pole opposite. The products of this division 

 (fig. 4) are very unequal, the cell C-D greatly exceeding A-B in size. 



Immediately after division both cells prepare to divide again, but 

 the two halves of the second cleavage are not simultaneous, C-I) divid- 




694 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



ing much in advance of A-B, as fig. 5 shows. As seen in the figure, the 

 spindle in €-D has reached the late anaphase, the chromosomes lying 

 close to the centrosomes, while a double row of microsomes has ap- 

 peared on the spindle fibres. On the other hand, in A-B the spindle 

 has only just reached the mctaphase. The division of A-B is nearly 

 equal, A being sHghtly the larger product, while the division of C-D is 

 highly unequal. The spindles for both divisions are inclined in a 

 leiotropic direction, as is especially well shown by the division of 

 A-B in fig. 6, in which the left pole of the spindle is much higher than 

 the right. 



The four cells formed by the second cleavage all differ in size (figs. 6 

 and 7, text fig. II, A and B) ; while D is relatively colossal, C, B, and 

 A are more nearly alike. Of these C is the largest, A slightly smaller 

 than C, while B is the smallest of all. The enormous size of D can be 



Fig. II. A, 4-cell stage from animal pole; B. .same from right side. 



appreciated only when the 4-cell stage is viewed from the side, as shown 

 in text fig. II, B. 



The size relation of the four cells A, B, C and D appears to be some- 

 what uniLSual. In all Annelida and Mollusca investigated which have 

 unequal cleavage the left posterior blastomcre D is the largest one of 

 the 4-cell stage, except in the case of Aplysia (Blochmann, 1883; Ca- 

 razzi, 1900) and the Pteropoda thecosomata (Fol, 1875). A and B are 

 usually equal, while C is more or less intermediate between B. and D. 

 Among the Lamcllibranchia there appear to exist cases parallel to that 

 of Dinophilus. An examination of the figures given for Cyclas (Stauflf- 

 acher, 1893), for Unio (Lillie, 1895) and for Dreissensia (Meisenheimer, 

 1901) seems to indicate that in these forms B is the smallest of the four 

 cells, whOe it is fairly evident that C exceeds A in size, although I find 

 no precise statement of these facts in the text of the papers mentioned 

 above. In all these forms D is relatively enormous. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 695 



In the 4-cell stage of the Dinophilus ovum but one polar furrow 

 is usually present, that at the animal pole, formed by the junction of 

 A and C. This furrow is very long and turns to the right when seen 

 in the second cleavage plane. At the vegetal pole all four cells meet 

 at a point (figs. 6 and 7, text fig. II, A and B). The condition where 

 a polar furrow exists at the animal pole is also found in the Lamelli- 

 branchs mentioned alone ; in these, however, the fmrow is formed by 

 the junction of B and D. The phenomenon of a long polar furrow 

 existing at the animal pole in Unio is explained by Lillie (1895) as 

 being due to the fact that "the greater mass of the first blastomeres 

 is ectodermal." This explanation fits the case of Unio very well, since 

 the blastomere D which contains the greatest mass of ectoderm takes 

 part in the formation of the polar furrow, but docs not explain the 

 situation in Dinophilus, where D is entirely excluded from the polar 

 furrow. This condition is probably due to two factors: (1) the ex- 

 treme obliquity of the second cleavage spindles; and (2) to the rela- 

 tively small size of B. The inclination of the spindles in A-B and C-D 

 cause A and C to lie above B and D and so meet in a long cross furrow. 

 Were B as large as either A or C it would meet D in a furrow at the 

 vegetal pole, but since its mass is so much less than that of the other 

 cells it just touches D at the vegetal pole. 



The somewhat complex relation of the j&rst and second cleavage 

 planes to the embryonic axis will be discussed in a later section; for 

 the pm-pose of convenience in description, however, the blastomeres 

 A and B will be considered as anterior, C and D as posterior. 



(3) Segregation of Ectohlast. 4-26 cells. 



Immediately after the second cleavage of the ovum the nuclei of 

 the blastomeres resume mitotic activity. In fig. 6 asters are seen in 

 all four cells, while between A and C there are still the remains of 

 >pindle fibres to be seen. In D the asters have assumed nearly their 

 definitive position, indicating where the ends of the dexiotropic spindle 

 are to liei 



At this time there comes to light a curious and striking feature of 

 the cleavage of the Dinophilus egg, mentioned by Lang (1884) as occur- 

 ring in Discoccelis, by Lillie for Unio (1895) and by Jennings for 

 Asplanchna (1896), also by Child (1900) as occurring occasionally in 

 Arenicola at the third cleavage. This peculiarity consists in the fact 

 that the raacromeres never divide simultaneously, but always succes- 

 sively and in a regular and invariable order. This order is the same 

 as that of Utiio and Arenicola, i.e., D, C, A, B, while that of Asplanchna 




696 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



is D, C, B, A. This order of division is maintained by the macromeres 

 through five successive cleavages, and is more or less perfectly retained 

 by their descendants. This succession is well shown in the o\aim 

 represented in fig. 8, where the nuclei of the cells ID, IC, Id and Ic 

 are in the prophase of the next division, while a bundle of spindle 

 fibres still connects the nuclei of lA and la and the micromere lb is 

 scarcely yet cut off from IB. This sequence in the division of the 

 macromeres is clearly correlated with the difference in the sizes of A 

 B, C and D, since it has already been pointed out that in relative size 

 the macromeres follow^ one another in the order D, C, A, B, which is 

 also the order of their division. It is evident that this is only a special 

 instance of a widespread class of phenomena, discussed by Kofoid 

 (1894), who points out that in many ova the larger blastomeres, i.e., 

 those containing a greater amount of yolk, or rather more cytoplasm, 

 tend to divide more rapidly than do the smaller ones. This, as Kofoid 

 shows, is in contradiction to Balfour (1880), who formulated a law 

 which supposes yolk to retard the cleavage. Kofoid ingeniously 

 explains the contradiction by suggesting that "difference in the rapid- 

 ity of cleavage is apparently correlated with the greater or less absolute 

 amount of protoplasm," and that the amount of protoplasm in turn 

 may be increased through the appropriation of yolk and the ratio of 

 division may be thus indirectly hastened. In Dinophilus, however, 

 while it seems tolerably plain that the difference in the time of division 

 of the macromeres is related to their difference in size, yet the latter 

 fact at first sight appears scarcely adequate to explain the great dela;v 

 in the di\'isions of B as compared with those of A, since between these 

 two blastomeres the difference in size is comparatively slight. On 

 the other hand, it must be remembered that since the macromeres 

 have different rates of di\dsion the gap between the time of division of 

 the four blastomeres may be considerably wddcned as the cleavage 

 progresses; in other words, A may start with but a sHght lead over 

 B, yet it is, through its more rapid rate of division, enabled to increase 

 that lead in subsequent di\asions. This difference in the rates of 

 division of the four quadrants will become obvious by reference to 

 the table of cell-lineage at the back of the paper. 



The spindles for the third cleavage are inclined strongly to the right, 

 and the daughter cells, the first quartette of ectomeres, when first 

 formed lie in the furrow between the macromeres. The diameter of 

 these ceUs, as figs. 8 and 9 show, is about two-thirds of that of the 

 macromeres from which they arose. They are not, however, all of the 

 same size, the two posterior micromeres Id and Ic being equal in size 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 697 



and larger than the anterior pair la and lb which also arc equal. 

 This size relation between the members of the first quartette occurs 

 in Nereis (Wilson, 1892), Amphitrite and Clymenella (Mead, 1897), in 

 Arenicola (Child, 1900), and, as the figures appear to indicate, in Capi- 

 tella (Eisig, 1898), although Eisig states (p. 7) that the micromeres 

 are "unter sich aber annaherend gleich grosscn Zellen." Among the 

 Mollusca this size relation seems not to appear at all. 



The next cleavage, the fourth, is inaugurated by the second division 

 of ID. In fig. 8 this macromere is seen to be already in the pro- 

 phase of division, and while the other cells in the ovum are preparing 

 for division ID separates by a leiotropic division into the relatively 

 enormous cell 2d and the macromere 2D, which has now been reduced to 

 the size of its fellows (figs. 9 and 10). 2d, the "first somatoblast" of 

 von Wistinghausen (1891), which I shall label X, following Goette and 

 most recent writers on the cell-lineage of annelids, lies in the second 

 cleavage furrow slightly to the left of the mid-Hne. This cell is a most 

 valuable aid to orientation, owing to its large size and fixed position. 

 In this last division the macromere 2D, the smaller division product, 

 becomes displaced, being crowded downwards so as to be almost directly 

 below lA (figs. 9 and 10). A similar displacement of 2D occurs also 

 in Unio (Lillie, 1895), Dreissensia (Meisenlieimer, 1901), Capitella 

 (Eisig, 1898), and probably whenever the cell 2d greatly exceeds in 

 size its parent macromere. 2D subsequently returns to the level of 

 the other macromeres. 



At about the time 2d is produced the first quartette undergoes a 

 rotation in an anti-clockwise direction, so that each micromcre comes 

 to lie exactly over the macromere from which it arose (cf. figs. 8 and 

 10). This rotation is undoubtedly brought about by the division of 

 ID to form 2d, the latter cell being pushed backward and upward in a 

 leiotropic direction. In Crepidula (Conklin, 1897), Arenicola (Child, 

 1900) and in other forms a similar rotation is brought about through 

 the formation of the cells of the second quartette. 



The micromeres Id and Ic next divide, the spindles being inclined in 

 a leiotropic direction. Through these divisions there are budded off 

 from Id and Ic, on their peripheral sides, small cells of equal size, 

 Id^ and Ic^ Id^ being formed first (figs. 9 and 10). These cells, though 

 formed by a truly spiral division, come to lie laterally to their parent 

 cells and overhung by them (figs. 10, 11, and 12). A little later la and 

 lb follow in a similar division, the cells la^ and Ib^ being equal in size 

 and somewhat smaller than kP and Ic^ and come to lie in the furrow 

 below the micromeres la^ and Ib^ and to the right of them. These 

 45 




698 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



last-formed cells are minute and were at first difficult to detect, being 

 overhung by their parent cells. The four cells Id^, Ic^, la^ and Ib^ 

 correspond both in origin and subsequent fate to the " trochoblasts " 

 of annelids and to the "tm-ret cells" of mollusks, and ^\-ill be termed 

 "trochoblasts," since the cleavage resembles that of the annelids 

 rather than that of the mollusks. 



While the trochoblasts are forming, lA and IC are in division (figs. 

 11 and 12), giving rise to two other members of the second quartette. 

 The di\'ision of the two macromeres is nearly simultaneous, though C 

 Ls slightly in advance. The two micromeres 2c and 2a are nearly 

 equal in size to the two anterior cells of the first quartette. 



Coincident with the division of lA and IC is the di\-ision of X (2d), 

 the first step in the fourth cleavage (figs. 11, 12 and 13). X buds off 

 a cell of about a third of its own diameter, low down on the right side 

 (x^, figs. 12 and 13). Closely following the formation of x^ is the leio- 

 tropic division of IB to form 2b, the last member of the second quar- 

 tette, and the dexiotropic di\-ision of 2D to form the first member of 

 the third quartette, 3d (figs. 13 and 16). Thus the macromere of 

 the D quadrant has now obtained a lead of one division over the macro- 

 mere of the B quadrant, and this lead is maintained as far as the for- 

 mation of the fifth quartette. 3b is the smallest member of the second 

 quartette, w^hile 3d will prove to be the largest member of the third. 

 Soon after 3d the other members of the third quartette appear one by 

 one, 3c and 3a equal in size, and last 3b, the smallest of the four, which 

 does not appear until after the formation of the mesoblast cell 4d 

 (figs. 13 to 20). 



Meanwhile divisions arc occurring in the first and second quartettes. 

 The divisions of the former are dexiotropic and concern the four larger 

 cells only. The left products are nearly alike in size ; smaller than the 

 right products in the posterior quadrants, nearly equal to them in the 

 anterior. There is thus formed a flat cap of eight cells (fig. 14), four 

 of which lie radially and four interradially ; the former, la^-^, Ib^-^, Ic^-^ 

 Id^-^, correspond in origin and ver}^ probably in fate to the "intermedi- 

 ate girdle cells" of Nereis (Wilson, 1892), and they will hereafter be 

 called such. The four remaining cells, following the same terminology, 

 will be called "stem cells." While these last divisions are in progress 

 and the third quartette forming, 2a and 2c each buds off a small cell at 

 its apex (figs. 15 and 16, 2a^ and 2c'). According to the rule of altei- 

 nating cleavage this division should be leiotropic; in fact it is nearly 

 equatorial, though the di\'ision of 2b, which occurs later, is strongly 

 dexiotropic. The ovum represented in figs. 14, 15 and 16 is the only 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 699 



one seen which shows this division in progress. However, the subse- 

 quent position of the cells 2a^ and 2c^ shows this division to be very 

 nearly an equatorial one, though the next division of the cells 2a^ and 

 2c^ is strongly leiotropic (figs. 26 and 27). The cells 2a^ and 2c^ lie 

 above their parent cells and in contact with the stem and intermediate 

 girdle cells, at the same level with the trochoblasts. In consideration 

 of their origin and subsequent fate they will be given the name "second- 

 ary trochoblasts," which is given by Mead (1897) to cells of similar 

 origin and fate in Amphitrite and Clymenella. During these last divi- 

 sions X has given rise to a cell on its left side x^, in size similar to x\ 

 and nearly opposite that cell but at a somewhat higher level (figs. 16 

 and 18 and fig. 42). At the same time x^ is also undergoing division, 

 giving off a cell x^- at its lower side. This is the so-called anal cell 

 (Mead, 1897). 



(4) Segregation of Mesoblast. 



In the ovum represented in figs. 15, 16, and 17, a large spindle is 

 seen in 3D. In fig. 18 the spindle is in the anaphase and the cell body 

 has elongated, clearly indicating by the unequal size of its lobes the 

 very unequal character of the division products. The latter are shown 

 in fig. 24, the division having been completed. The posterior larger 

 product is 4d, the chief mesoderm cell of moUusks and polychatous 

 annelids. According to the law of alternating cleavage the spindle 

 for this division should be leiotropic; in fact it is dexiotropic. This 

 reversal in direction of the spindle can be accounted for partly by the 

 crowding downward of 4d during the process of its formation. In the 

 ovum represented in fig. 16 the spindle in 3B is nearly horizontal, while 

 in that represented in fig. 18 it is inclined almost 40° to the horizontal 

 plane. This inclination is clearly brought about by the great size of 

 both 4d and X. Abutting as it does against X, 4d is prevented from 

 attaining the level of 4D, and thus the left end of the spindle comes to 

 be the lower. Why the spindle should not be inclined leiotropically 

 at first is not clear. 



The position of 4d in front of and below X and slightly to the left 

 of the mid-line is almost precisely that of 4d in Nereis (Wilson, 1892), 

 where the conditions concerned in its formation are very similar to 

 those prevailing in Dinophilns. 



4D is now reduced to about half the size of its fellows. This great 

 reduction in size of the macromere 41) is not known among the anne- 

 lids, but among mollusks it is a fairly common condition, e.g., 

 Umbrella (Heymons, 1893), Unio (Lillie, 1895), Ischnochiton (Heath. 

 1899), Dreissensia (Melsenheimer, 1901). Trochus (Robert, 1903). 




700 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



With the formation of 4d and 3b the segregation of the germ layers 

 flow consists of 29 cells distributed as follows :

Thus in Dinophilus another example is alread}^ added to a long list 

 of forms in which the ectoblast arises from the first three quartettes 

 of micromeres, the mesoblast from the left posterior cell of the fourth 

 quartette, and the entoblast from the remaining cells. To this mode 

 of origin of the germ layers apparently the cephalopods alone form 

 an exception. Among the annelids it is at present known to obtain

only in the groups of the Polychseta and Echiuridse. The fine paper 

 of Eisig (1898) on Capitella seems to indicate that this manner of 

 derivation of the germ layers does not extend to the Capitellidse, 

 since in Capitella Eisig derives the permanent mesoblast ("coelo- 

 mesoblast") from cells of the third quartette (3c^ and 3d^), while 

 4d gives rise to larval or secondary mesoblast ("psedomesoblast") 

 and ectoderm. However, in view of the probable tendency of the ova 

 of Capitella to abnormal development, it is, I think, permissible to 

 doubt these somewhat surprising results until they are verified in the 

 same or some allied form. These results seem all the more surpri.sing 

 in view of the great resemblance which, in other respects, the cleavage 

 bears to that of the Polychseta. Among the Echiuridae, Torrey (1902, 

 1903) has found that Thalassema in its cleavage and in its mode of 

 origin of the germ layers agrees closely with the Polychseta. 




1904.1

701 



As compared with the Polychseta the origin of the mesoblast cell 4D 

 in Dinophilus occurs very early. In fact the segregation of the three 

 germ layers is completed at almost the same instant, since while 3D is 

 di\dding to form 4d, 2B is also dividing to form 3b. If, as Mead (1897) 

 urges, the mesoblast belongs to the ideal 64-cell stage, then 4d should 

 typically arise only after the 32-cell stage. As a matter of fact, it

does so arise in all the Polychseta who.se early development has been 

 investigated, and also in Thalassema (Torrey, 1902, 1903). On the 

 other hand, in Capitella 4d belongs to the 29-cell stage, while among 

 the Mollusca are several forms in which 4d is segregated before the 

 32-cell stage, e.g., Neritina (Blochmann, 1882), Crepidula (Conklin, 

 1897), Physa (Wierzejski, 1897). At the other end of the series 




702 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



stands Ischnocldton (Heath. 1899), in which the formation of 4cl is 

 delayed until the 72-cell stage. Yet, in spite of these modifications, 

 which are plainly of a ccEnogenetic nature, it is a remarkable fact, 

 as Heath (1898) has pointed out. that the definitive mesoblast pre- 

 serves its origin from 3D. 



V. — OUTLIXE OF THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. 



In order to make the histories of the Cjuartettes more intelligible, it 

 is desirable to give a brief account of the later history of Dinophihis, 

 up to the time of hatching. ]\Iy observations in regard to the main 

 points agree essentially with the account given by Schimkewitsch 

 (1895) for the White Sea form. 



After the segregation of the germ layers, i.e., at the 29-cell stage, a 

 cleavage ca\'ity of considerable size has been formed, and this cleavage 

 cavity persists up to a stage of about 54 cells when it has reached its 

 maximum size (text fig. Ill, A). The ovum is now roughly spherical 

 in outline. Very soon, however, the ectoderm cells which roof the 

 cleavage ca\dty spread out and flatten down, thus greatly red vicing it, 

 and finally causing it to be obHterated complete^ (text fig. IV, 

 A and B). This flattening of the cap of ectoderm produces a pro- 

 nounced change in the contour of the embryo, which is now decidedly 

 elongated at right angles to the egg axis, i.e., in an antero-postcrior 

 direction, and this elongation becomes more pronounced as develop- 

 ment progresses. The ectodermal cap — that is, all of the ectoderm 

 exclusive of the 2d group — now moves over the entoderm in a fon\-ard 

 direction. The various stages of this movement are illustrated in 

 text fig. IV, A, B, C and D. In the embryo A, the boundary of the 

 first quartette, marked by a dotted line, lies in a plane nearly parallel 

 to the long axis of the embryo; the apical rosette and the vegetal pole 

 are still nearl}^ opposite one another. In the embryo B the forv\ard 

 movement of the ectodermal cap can plainly be scon to have begun. 

 Embryos C, D and E show the further movements leading to the 

 closure of the blastopore, which brings the first cjuartette into a posi- 

 tion at the anterior end of the embrj'O, after ha\'ing rotated through 

 an angle of about 80 degrees. That part of the ectoderm which for- 

 merly marked the am'mal pole, the apical rosette or its derivatives, is 

 now just dorsal to the anterior pole of the embryo, while the boundary 

 of the first quartette lies in a plane almost at right angles to the long 

 axis of the embryo. This fon\-ard movement of the ectoderm is 

 brought about by the mitotic acti\aty of the cells of the 2d group 

 dorsal to X — X, viz., x', x^-x*, x^-x^, etc.. and probably also of cells de- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 703 



rived from the intermediate girdle cell of the D quadrant. Mead (1897). 

 Treadwell (1901) and Torrey (1903) have shown that in the annelids 

 Amphitritc, Podorkc and Thalasscma respectively cells from this region 

 wander out through the dorsal gap of the prototroch and contribute to 

 the dorsal ectoderm of the trochophore. The thinness of the dorsal 

 ectoderm of the Dinophilus embryo after the closure of the blastopore 

 bears witness to the great mitotic activit}^ in this region (compare figs. 

 54 and 56 and fig. 58) . Wliile this forward movement is taking place the 

 ectoderm is increasing in lateral extent, as comparison of the embryos 

 illustrated in text fig. IV readily shows. At the same time on the ven- 

 tral side cells of the ventral plate have covered over the mesomeres, 

 so that now the entoblast is completely enclosed with the exception 

 of a small area at the vegetal pole, the blastopore. This soon closes, 

 the ectodermal cells fusing so smoothly as to leave no visible trace of 

 their union. ^Meanwhile the entodermal cells have undergone a 

 change in that their lower or vegetal pole ends have become progres- 

 sivel}' smaller as the blastopore closes, while their upper or animal pole 

 ends have become correspondingly larger. During this change in 

 shape of the entomeres their nuclei recede from the surface and move 

 inward (figs. 53-56). 



The stomodseum appears as a shallow depression of the ectoderm 

 at the point where the blastopore closed (fig. 58). The ventral 

 plate now begins to grow forward very rapidh', pushing the stomo- 

 dseum before it until the latter reaches a subterminal position, the 

 position of the definitive mouth (fig. 59, st.). The stomodseal invagina- 

 tion now deepens from a shallow depression to a finger-like inpushing, 

 directed somewhat backward. In fig. 59 the posterior wall of the 

 stomodaeum is seen to have thickened; this mass of cells (pro.) is the 

 rudiment of the proboscis. In fig. 60 this organ (pro.) has assumed 

 essentially its tlefinitive structure and relations. From the stomodaeal 

 invagination is formed all of the alimentary canal anterior to the 

 -stomach, including the ^'ormagen or proventriculus. 



While these changes arc taking place the entodermal cells have been 

 slowly dividing and have arranged themselves about a centrally situ- 

 ated cleft, the rudiment of the lumen of the future stomach and intes- 

 tine (fig. 59, sto.l.). As the development progresses the entodermal 

 cells assume the arrangement and appearance of an epithelium, while 

 at the same time the lumen of the future stomach increases in extent. 

 In fig. 60 the entoderm cells are now seen to form a cuboid al epithelium, 

 while the lumen of the stomach is a long and narrow cleft, extending 

 obliquely downward and forward. From the posterior end of the 




704 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



stomach projects a short diverticiihim, the rudiment of the intestine 

 (int. 1.). 



The proctodseum appears, at the time that the stomodgeiim has 

 assumed its final position, as a simple thickening of the ectoderm at the 

 posterior end of the body (fig. 59, pr.). At a later stage a small depres- 

 sion appears in this thickening (fig. 60, pr.). The proctodseum prob- 

 ably forms only the terminal portion of the intestine, or anus. Fusion 

 of the proctodseum and stomodseum with the entodermal portion of 

 the aHmentary tract does not take place until very shortly before 

 hatching. 



The rudiment of the brain appears early. Just after the blastopore 

 has closed, the ectoderm at the anterior end of the embryo is thicker 

 than elsewhere, presenting the appearance shown in optical section 

 in fig. 58. The cells of this region multiply rapidly, and the ectoderm 

 here soon becomes many-layered (fig. 59). At a later period (figs. 60 

 and 61) a transverse band of nerv^e fibres (br.com.) is seen below 

 and in contact ^dth the ectoderm at this point, while the nuclei of the 

 deeper layers have become very nmnerous. The latter undoubtedly 

 constitute the nuclei of the ganglion cells, while the band of nerve 

 fibres constitutes the commissure connecting the lateral lobes of the 

 brain of the adult. The brain is now essentially similar to that of the 

 adult, which remains throughout life in contact with the ectoderm of 

 the head. 



The fiu-ther changes before hatching consist principally in the elonga- 

 tion of the body and the formation of somites. The rapid growth of the 

 ventral plate causes the embr^'o to bend strongly toward the dorsal 

 side, as is shown in fig. 60, though here the flexure is not nearly so great 

 as it becomes at a still later period. This rapid growth of the ventral 

 ectoderm is apparently not compensated for by a corresponding 

 growth of the dorsal ectoderm until shortly before hatching. The 

 head is separated from the trunk by a constriction at a stage corre- 

 sponding to that illustrated in fig. 59, that is, as soon as the stomodseum 

 has taken up its final position at the anterior end of the embryo. The 

 trunk segments do not appear until the body begins to elongate, when 

 the constrictions which mark them off appear successively from in 

 front backward. In the embryo shown in horizontal section in fig. 

 61, one trunk segment, the first, is clearly shown, while two more are 

 indicated posterior to this one.

VI. — History of the First Quartette. 

 (1) The Cross and the Intermediate Girdle Cells. 



At the time of the formation of the mesoblast cell 4d, the first quar- 

 tette consists of twelve cells — four stem cells, four intermediate girdle 

 cells and four trochoblasts (fig. 14). According to the ideal scheme 

 the trochoblasts should by this time have divided once, but their rate 

 of division is very greatly retarded, obviously in correlation with the 

 comparatively late period at which they become functional. 



The stem cells are the next to divide. Even before 4d is formed, the 

 posterior stem cells (Id^-^ and Ic^-^) are preparing for a Iciotropic 

 cleavage (fig. 14). These divide and la^-^ and Ib^-^ soon follow; the 

 upper (left) products resulting from the division are four small cells 

 of equal size, forming a quatrefoil at the animal pole, the ''rosette" 

 of Nereis (Wilson, 1892) and other annelids (fig. 20). 



While the rosette is forming, the intermediate girdle cells arc also 

 engaged in a leiotropic division which is unequal in all save the D 

 quadrant (fig. 20). In the A, B and C quadrants the right and periph- 

 eral product is a small cell, to which, in consideration of its origin and 

 probable fate, has been given the name ''accessory trochoblast," a 

 term applied by Heath (1899) to cells of Ischnochiton of similar origin 

 and fate. 



While the division of the stem cells and intermediate girdle cells is 

 in progress the trochoblasts also divide (figs. 20, 21, 22 and 29). 

 Ic^ and Id^ usually divide at nearly the same time, although in fig. 14 

 Ic^ is the only trochoblast showing a spindle; la^ follows more or less 

 closely on Id^ and Ic^, while Ib^ is always delayed. The division is 

 meridional in the posterior trochoblasts ; in the anterior pair the plane 

 of division, although very nearly meridional, is nevertheless inclined 

 sufficiently to indicate a dcxiotropic cleavage (fig. 29)'. 



Returning to the stem cells, the posterior pair of these are found to 

 be again in mitotic activity, their spindles having reached the meta- 

 phase before the last division of Ib^-^ is fully completed (fig. 20). 

 These spindles are not spiral, but truly radial in position. Their 

 central ends lie at a higher level than their peripheral ends. 



This division marks the beginning of bilateral cleavages in tiie first 

 quartette, though these do not appear in the intermediate girdle cells. 

 In fig. 20 the symmetrical position of the spindles in Ic*-^ and Id^-^ is 

 obscured owing to the clockwise rotation of the first quartette, caused 

 by the formation of x^ in a dexiotropic direction. In fig. 25 may be 

 seen the products of this division: of these the peripheral products 

 are slightly the larger, and are ovei'lappod by the central products. 




706 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Oct. 



owing to the oblique position of the spindle. Meanwhile the first 

 quartette has rotated in an anti-clockwise direction, being thus restored 

 to its original position. Next la^-^-^ and Ib^-^-^ divide, the spindles in 

 their cells being also truly radial, with the central ends the higher. 

 The cell pattern produced by these divisions is similar to that first 

 found by Wilson (1892) in Nereis, Polymnia, Spio and Aricia, and 

 called by him "the cross." The characteristic feature of the cross is 

 the radial divisions of the stem cells. This, as has just been described, 

 is also the case in Dinophilus, but the cell pattern is marred by the 

 belated division of Ib^-^-^, which does not occur until the basal cells of 

 the posterior arms of the cross are again in division (fig. 30). The 

 cross is formed also in Amphitrite, CbjmeneUa and Lepidonotus (Mead, 

 A B 



Fig. V, A, the "cross" of Nereis, copied from Wilson (1892); B, diagram of the 

 "cross" of Dinophilus. The four quadrants are represented as having 

 divided simultaneously. 



1897), Capitella (Eisig, 1898), Arenicola and Sternaspis (Child, 1900), 

 and Podarke (Tread well, 1901). In Podarke the spindles are slightly 

 dexiotropic, and in Chcetopterus (Mead, 1897) they are so much so 

 that the cross is not formed at all. In Dinophilus the spindles are 

 truly radial, no trace of the spiral type having been observed. The 

 comparison of the Dinophilus cross and that of the polychaetous annelid 

 Nereis will be made clear by reference to text fig. V, A. and B. 



The radial spindles forming the cross mark the appearance of bilat- 

 eral cleavage in the first quartette. Not only is the cross in itself a 

 symmetrical structure, but it is bilaterally symmetrical with respect 

 to the median plane of the embryo, and this is, as Wilson pointed out 

 in Nereis (1892), "an adult bilaterality foreshadowed, long before 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENX'ES OF PHILADELPHIA. 707 



bilateral divisions begin, in the arrangement of the cells." In other 

 words, the adult bilaterality is expressed in the arrangement of the 

 fom- cells la'-^-, Ib^-^-, Ic^-^-^ and Id^-^-^ brought about through spiral 

 cleavages, and in fact foreshadowed in the 8-cell stage. These facts 

 have all been shown to be true for all the forms in which a cross occurs, 

 and need not be dwelt upon here. 



While the anterior stem cells are dividing to form the anterior arms 

 of the cross, new sp'indles appear in the intermediate girdle cells la^-^-^ 

 and Ic^--^ (figs. 25, 26 and 27). These cells then give rise at their 

 peripheral margins to tin}^ cells with a deeply staining nucleus (figs. 

 30, 31 and 32). The direction of these divisions is somewhat uncer- 

 tain, but judging by the position of the smaller products it is dexio- 

 tropic in la*-^-^ and Iciotropic in Ic^-^-^- Later Ib^-^-^ gives rise to a 

 similar cell (figs. 37 and 41). This division is unmistakably dexio- 

 tropic. It is of interest to note that in Amphitrite (Mead, 1897) and 

 Arenicola (Child, 1900) these same cells should also be small and pro- 

 vided with a densely staining nucleus. In Thalassema (Torrey, 1902, 

 1903) these cells are truly rudimentary, and it seems quite probable 

 that such is the case in Dinophilus also, judging from their minute- 

 ness and staining reactions. 



Closely following the division of Ib'-^" to form the right anterior 

 cross arm, indeed almost simultaneous with this division, is that of 

 the posterior basal cells of the cross. The plane of this division is 

 meridional, as is also the case in the annelid cross, but differs from the 

 latter in that the division is an asymmetrical one, since the left product 

 of the left posterior basal cell is very much smaller than the right 

 product, while the products of the right posterior basal cell are equal 

 (figs. 30 and 37). This curious divergence from the annelid type I 

 a,m at present unable to explain. Possibly a further study of the 

 cleavage and of the history of the individual cells of the cross might 

 offer a solution of the problem. Closely following the divisions of the 

 posterior basal cells comes the division of the posterior terminal cells. 

 The spindles for this division are meridional, and the upper and central 

 products of this division are minute cells, which lie abo^'e their parent 

 cells as shown in figs. 37, 38 and 39. These correspond in origin to the 

 "nephroblasts," which in Nereis (Wilson, 1892) form the head kidney 

 (or possibly slime glands), and which in Amphitrite (Mead, 1897) give 

 rise to the large mucous glands of the umbrella of the trochophore. In 

 Fodarke (Treadwell, 1901) these cells are also minute and occupy 

 relatively the same position as in Dinophilus. Treadwell describes 

 small cells of the first quartette which sink through the ectoblast and. 




708 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [C)ct., 



reaching the cleavage cavity, there degenerate. Torrey (1902, 1903) 

 suggests that among these small cells are those two mentioned above, 

 viz., ld^-i-2-2-1 and Ic^-^-^-^-^ In Clymenella the ncphroblasts are also 

 small and form part of the dorsal ectoderm of the head, as they do in 

 Arenicola. "UTiat the fate of these cells is in the case of Dinophilus 

 I do not know. 



The .significance of the annelid and molluscan crosses and of bilateral 

 cleavage in general has been most thoroughly discussed by recent 

 writers on cell-lineage, and on this particular point I have nothing to 

 add. Since, however, it is generally agreed that bilateral cleavages 

 are not directly referable to purely mecharjcal causes, but are the 

 result of unknown factors, which cause the throwing back of the 

 bilatcrality of the adult upon the embryo, it is remarkable that this 

 appearance of the adult bilaterality should have occurred in the same 

 cell generation, in the same direction, and resulting in the same 

 cell pattern as in the Polychseta. This resemblance is still further 

 continued in the direction of division of the posterior cross arms. 



The rosette cells at the time of their formation lie in the furrows 

 between the stem cells, but almost immediately afterward they move 

 in a clockwise direction (cf. la^-^-^ and la^-^-^ in fig. 20), so that the cells 

 now lie interradiallv, instead of radially, as in the annelid cross (text 

 fig.V,B). 



At a stage numbering between one hundred and one hundred and 

 fifty cells, the rosette divides dexiotropically and equally. Its cells, 

 which possibly later undergo another division, form a cluster of cells 

 much smaller than those surrounding it, and can be thus distinguished 

 nearly to the time of the closure of the blastopore. As far as my 

 observations on both fixed and living material extend, the rosette 

 never bears cilia. In Capitella also an apical tuft of cilia is never 

 present, though the rosette is formed as in other Annelida. 



The further history of the first quartette is comparatively simple. 

 The forward movement of the cells of the first quartette has already 

 been described (see text fig. IV, A-E). The limits of the first quar- 

 tette have been determined by two landmarks, the cells 2a^-^-^ and 

 2c^-^-^ on the right and left sides respectively, and that chain of small 

 cells which I have identified as the prototroch. These latter extend 

 over the sides, passing just anterior to the cells 2a^-^-^ and 2c--^-', and 

 around the ventral side as a continuous row, but on the dorsal side 

 there is the wide gap so often found in the early stages of the trocho- 

 phore larva, and due to the same cause, viz., the non-participation of 

 the products of 2d in the formation of the prototroch. Owing to this 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 709 



fact I have not been able to trace with certainty the dorsal posterior 

 limits of the first quartette. On the ventral side the boundary of 

 the first quartette is indicated in fig. 55 by the most anterior row of 

 small cells, and curves forward in a semicircle in front of the blastopore. 

 The position and general outline of the first quartette are sufficiently 

 indicated in text fig. IV, E. It covers like a cap the anterior end of the 

 embryo and corresponds to the umbrella of the trochophore. 



At the time of the appearance of the stomodaeum the ectoderm at the 

 anterior end of the embryo is seen (fig. 58) to consist of high columnar 

 cells, while the ectoderm cells covering the rest of the embryo — except 

 at the posterior end, where are the still large remnants of the X cells — 

 are cubical or flattened. The centre of this thickened area is not pre- 

 cisely the anterior pole of the larva, but slightly dorsal to that point, at 

 which place the descendants of the rosette were last recognized. This 

 thickening is the rudiment of the brain of the adult. At a later stage 

 the cells of the thickened area have multiplied and become so closely 

 ■crowded together that their outlines are barely distinguishable. In fig. 

 ■59 the brain rudiment has increased both in thickness and extent, and 

 has at the same time moved somewhat dorsad owing to the rapid 

 growth of the ventral plate. In fig. 58 the thickened area represents, 

 as comparison with text fig. lY. E, will show, less than half of the first 

 quartette; in fig. 59 it has increased to nearly twice its former area. 

 Fig. 60 shows the brain in sagittal section at a slightly later stage. On 

 the dorsal side, just behind the brain, is a deep furrow which in the 

 adult separates the head from the trunk. The lateral extent of the 

 brain is shown in fig. 61, a horizontal section of a stage more advanced 

 than that shown in fig. 60. In this embryo the brain already shows 

 signs of its bilobed character. From these figures it can be seen that 

 nearly the whole of the first quartette is involved in the formation of the 

 l^rain, if we assume that the second preoral ciliated band of the adult 

 arises from the trochoblasts, as is probably the case, since the brain 

 rudiment is limited posteriorly by the constriction which separates 

 the head and trunk; while the second preoral ciliated band of the adult 

 (prototroch) appears on the elevation of the head just anterior to this 

 constriction. 



The cell origin of the cerebral ganglia among the mollusks has been 

 very fully described by several recent investigators (Conklin, 1897; 

 Holmes, 1900; Mcisenheimer, 1901; Robert, 1903); among the anne- 

 lids by von Wistinghausen (1891) and by Wilson (1892) for Nereis,

erroneous, and believed that the cerebral cranglia arise from the cross. 

 Later investigators have been unable to either prove or disprove this 

 statement. It is at least certain that the brain is formed from the 

 first cjuartette of micromeres, and its first rudiment is found in the 

 neighborhood of the rosette. These facts, however, can be gathered 

 from the works of the older investigators (Hatschek. Salensky, et al). 

 In Dinophilus the rudiment of the cerebral ganglia involves more 

 than the cells of the cross alone. Its development, however, is typi- 

 cally annelidan, since the ectodermal thickening which represents the 

 earliest rudiment of the brain appears beneath the rosette, which in 

 the trochophore bears the apical tuft of cilia. This rudiment then is 

 to he regarded as the ontogenetic representative of the " Scheitelplatte" of 

 the annelid trochophore. 



(2) The Prototroch. 



The head of both the larval anrl adult individuals of Dinophilus 

 gyrociliatus (apatris) is encircled by two narrow transverse bands of 

 long cilia, similar to those which are found on the metameres of the 

 trunk, as illustrated in text fig. Yl. Both of these bands are preoral; 

 the first being situated just anterior to the eyes, the second surrounds 

 the head near its juncture with the trunk, and passes ventrally just 

 anterior to the mouth. This seconrl preoral band corresponds in posi- 

 tion and function to the prototroch of the trochophore. It first appears 

 at a stage nearly corresponding to that figured in fig. 59 as two delicate 

 tufts of cilia on each side of the head. 



The history of the cells composing this second preoral ciliated band, 

 which I have already taken the liberty of calling the prototroch, will 

 be considered under the head of the first quartette. I have done this 

 chiefly because of the important place given in the literatm-e of cell- 

 lineage to those components of the annelid prototroch and the mollus- 

 can velum derived from the first fpiartette, the "primary trocho- 

 blasts" (Mead, 1897). 



At the 29-cell stage the primary trochoblasts are already beginning 

 to divide (figs. 14 and 15). The division is ecpial in all. The posterior 

 pair divide meridionally, while in the anterior pair the spindle is in- 

 clined from the horizontal plane in a dexiotropic direction. While 

 the posterior pair begin to divide as early as the stage shown in fig. 14 

 (26 cells), Ib^ does not complete its division until a stage numbering 

 54 or more cells is reached. Meanwhile the cells of the second quar- 

 tette in the A and C quadrants have each given off a small cell above, b}' 

 a nearly equatorial cleavage (figs. 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19). 2b later also 

 divides, but this cleavage, instead of being ((piatorial. is stronglv dexio- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 711 



tropic, as it should be, following the law of alternating cleavage (fig. 29). 

 While this division is in progress, the lateral cells of the second quartette 

 are again in division (figs. 26 and 27). This division is leiotropic; its 

 result is that a cell similar to but smaller than 2a^ and 2c^ is placed to 

 the left of these cells. Lastly, 2b^ divides similarly, the products being 

 shown in fig. 41. For the six cells thus formed from the second quar- 

 tette, 2a\ 2a^\ etc., I have adopted IMead's name of "secondary trocho- 

 blasts," though they arc not precisely identical in origin with those 

 to which Mead gave this name. At a stage of about 81 cells the second- 

 ary trochoblasts 2a^ and 2c^ divide leiotropically and equally (figs. 34 

 and 35). No doubt 2b^ also follows suit, though I have not seen this 

 division. 



The origin of the "accessory trochoblasts" la^-^-, etc.. by the dexio- 

 tropic division of the intermediate girdle cells has already been de- 

 scribed. There is now an irregular row, formed of 22 small cells, 

 which encircles the embryo at a level just between the first and second 

 quartettes. These cells are arranged as follows, passing from left to 

 right: ld2-2-lcPi-2a2-i-2ai-2-2aii-la2-2, etc. It is very probable that 

 the accessory and primary trochoblasts soon divide again, since in 

 the embryo from which fig. 50 was drawn Ic^-^ and Ic^-^-^ were both 

 undergoing an equal and meridional division. The row of cells thus 

 formed is clearly distinguishable up to the closure of the blastopore, 

 and it was by means of this row^ as well as by the large size of 2a- --^ and 

 2c^-^-^ that I have been able to trace the boundary of the first quartette, 

 as shown in text fig. IV, A. The trochoblasts are very transparent, 

 and become elongated in the direction of the cell row. 



At the stage shown in fig. 55 the prototroch is nearly transverse to 

 the long axis of the embryo, as is also shown by the dotted line in text 

 fig. IV, E, but in front of the blastopore it bends sharply forward in a 

 semicircle. In these figures the trochoblasts are represented by the 

 most anterior row of that group of small cells lying just anterior to 

 the blastopore. Beyond the stage represented in fig. 55 I have not 

 been able to trace this group, since all the cells of the ectoderm, through 

 rapid mitosis, soon become nearly uniformly small in size. In fig. 44, 

 where the trochoblasts were last identified, they were on the ventral 

 side, but a short distance anterior to the blastopore, and passed up on 

 each side in a row nearly transverse to the long axis of the embryo (cf. 

 text fig. IV, E). Since the stomoda'um appears at the point where 

 the blastopore closed and is then pushed forward through growth of 

 the ventral ectoderm (ventral plate), it follows that the trochoblasts 

 must still remain as a more or less transverse row passing in front of 

 the stomoda.nim. At the close of the ( nihryonic life, when the trans- 




712 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Oct., 



verse ciliated bands characteristic of the embryo are acquired, among 

 these is one which passes around the head just in front of the mouth, 

 and occupying precisely the position that the row of trochoblasts 

 would be expected to assume after the growth changes which have 

 taken place. It must either be supposed that the ciliated ring in 

 question is derived from the trochoblasts or else from other cells 

 occupying a very similar position. Of the two hypotheses the latter 

 appears to me much the more probable, especially in view of the per- 

 sistence of the prototroch in many annelid larvae, where it encircles the 

 head, passing ventrally just anterior to the mouth, its position thus 

 essentially coinciding with that of the second preoral ciliated band of 

 Dinophilus. 



The cell origin of the annelid prototroch has been determined in 

 Nereis (Wilson, 1892), Amphitrite and Clymenella (Mead, 1897), Areni- 

 cola (Child, 1900) and Podarke (Treadwell, 1901). Among the mollusks 

 the precise cell origin of the velum has been determined in but two 

 forms, Ischnochiton (Heath, 1899) and Trochus (Robert, 1903), 

 although in two other forms, Crepidula (Conklin, 1897) and Planorhis 

 (Holmes, 1900), the origin of the velum has been determined with con- 

 siderable, if not absolute, certainty. Below is given, for the sake of 

 convenience in comparison, a table of the components of the proto- 

 troch and velum in the A quadrant of those forms in which it has been 

 most carefully worked out. The components of the prototroch of 

 Dinophilus are added for comparison.

All the forms mentioned have the primary trochoblasts in common; 

 in all, except Nereis, the gaps between the four groups of primary 

 trochoblasts are closed partly or entirely by cells derived from 2a\ 2c^ 

 and 2bS' Ischnochiton, Podarke and Dinophilus agree in that the cells 

 la^-2-^, lb^-^-2 and Ic^-^-^ participate in the prototroch. In common 

 with the annelids, there is also a dorsal gap in the prototroch, owing to 

 the fact that none of the cells of the D quadrant, except the primary 

 trochoblasts, take part in its formation. 



Dinophilus differs from all the other forms in (1) the small size of 

 the primary trochoblasts, (2) that at least the posterior pair of the 

 primary trochoblasts probably divide twice meridionally, and (3) in 

 that 2a2-^, 2b^-^ and 2c'-^ also take part in closing the gaps between the 

 groups of primary trochoblasts in the quadrants A, B and C. These 

 differences, however, are of slight importance compared with the great 

 and striking similarity to the annelids manifested in the origin of the 

 cells which almost certainly form the second preoral ciliated band of 

 the adult Dinophilus. In the light of this similarity the conclusion 

 is almost unavoidable that the second preoral ciliated hand of Dino- 

 philus is truly the homologue of the annelid prototroch. 



The peculiarities in the formation of the Dinophilus prototroch 

 become readily comprehensible if the character of the end result, 

 i.e., the second ciliated band, be considered, and also the time at 

 which this organ comes into functional 

 activity. The cleavages in-\-olvcd in the 

 formation of the prototroch are thus clearly 

 seen to be of prospective significance, or 

 morphogenetic. 



The ciliated bands of the larval or adult 

 Dinophilus are, as compared with the pro- 

 totroch or velum of such forms as Amphi- 

 trite, Arenicola, Podarke, Ischnochiton or 

 Trochus, relatively narrow tracts (text fig. 

 VI), consisting of but a few rows of long 

 cilia, as shown in the figures of Korschelt 

 (1882) or Meyer (1887). Moreover, these 

 tracts probably do not become functional 

 until late in embryonic life. Conklin 

 (1897) has shown that the size of the pro- 



toblast of an organ is related not only to the siz( • f that organ, but 

 also to the time at which it becomes functional. In the light of this 

 fact the small size of all the trochoblasts is easily ex [liaincd.

The two meridional cleavages of the primary trochoblasts and the 

 participation of 2a^-\ 2b^-^ and 2c--^ in the prototroch tend toward the 

 same end, i.e., the production of a narrow band of small cells. 2a. 2b 

 and 2c, instead of each giving off one large cell to the prototroch 

 which subdivides into four cells, covering a broad area, each lays 

 down side by side two small cells, which may then diAdde meridionally 

 (or nearly so) without \dolation of the law of alternating cleavages, and 

 thus increase the length of the prototroch, but not its breadth. 



VII. — History of the Second and Third Quartettes. 

 (1) 2d (=Z). 

 The origin of 2d ( = X) has already been described. The size of this 

 cell is enormous as compared with that of the other cells of the embryo. 

 This relatively enormous size recalls the conditions found among the 

 lamellibranchs, Cijclas (Stauffacher, 1893), Unio (Lillie, 1895) and 

 Dreissensia (Meisenheimer, 1901), and among annelids in Arenicola 

 (Child, 1900), and also in Clepsine (WTiitman, 1878). The first two 

 divisions of this cell have already been described ; the products of these 

 divisions and the first product of the third division, x^, are shown in fig. 

 42. In this figure it is seen that x^ and x^ are not precisely symmetrical 

 with respect to X, either in size or position, since x^ is somewhat larger 

 than x^ and placed at a higher level on X. x^-^ lies precisely in the 

 ventral mid-line, x^ lies dorsally to the left, as viewed from behind, 

 and has been formed by a dexiotropic division of X. The approaching 

 division of x^-^ and x^-^ as shown in the figure is of interest, since x^-^ 

 is the first cell in the embryo to \dolate the law of alternating cleavages, 

 inasmuch as the spindle for this division has the same direction as 

 that which formed x^-^. This reversal of the spindle in x^-^ was first 

 pointed out by ]\Iead (1897) for Amphitrite, and was also found by 

 Child (1900) in Arenicola. The products of this division and the cor- 

 responding one of x^ are shown in fig. 43. In this figure are also shown 

 the spindles for the fourth cleavage of the X group. Two points are 

 to be noted in this cleavage : (1) the division of x^ has eyidently pushed 

 x^ toward the left (right in the figure), bringing it almost into the mid- 

 line ; and (2) X is dividing into bilaterally placed halves. This bilateral 

 division of X is a striking and constant feature of the unequal type of 

 cleavage among the polychaetous annelids. A similar division occurs 

 in the lamellibranchs, but appears at the fifth cleavage, instead of at 

 the fourth. All the products of the fourth cleavage of X are shown 

 in fig. 44. x**-^ has budded off a small cell below; x^-^ has divided into 

 nearly equal parts by a meridional cleavage; while x^ has split into 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 715 



unequal parts, the left product being the greater, and occupying a 

 median position in the cleft between X and X. The cell x^-^-^ is now 

 nearly equal to x^-^-\, and their next two divisions (figs. 47 and 49) 

 are bilaterally symmetrical. The same may be said of the small cells 

 x^-i-^ and x'-^ (figs. 41 to 48). While I have not followed the history 

 of these latter cells further, it is extremely probable that their divisions 

 are also bilaterally symmetrical. There is here then an iastance of a 

 symmetrical arrangement of cells derived by asymmetrical divisions, 

 examples of which are found in the annelid and molluscan crosses, and 

 in the X group of Amphifrite (Mead, 1897) and Arenicola (Child, 1900), 

 and probably also in many other forms. While x^-^-^-^ and x^-^-^ are 

 almost equal, x---' is really somewhat the smaller of the two; and in 

 this connection it is of interest to remember that on this side, the left, 

 next to x^-^-^, lies the largest member of the third quartette, viz., 3d. 

 Returning to figs. 44 and 45, the cells x^-^-^ and x^-^ are seen to have each 

 given off a minute cell toward the vegetal pole. These cells are also 

 shown in figs. 38 and 39. 



The products of the bilateral division of X, called by Wilson (1892) 

 the "posterior proteleblasts," and by Child (1900) the "posterior stem 

 cells," undergo a series of bilateral divisions. The first is shown in 

 figs. 45-47, X* and x*. These cells have pushed forward x^-*-^-^ and 

 x^-^ -^ The cells formed by the next division of the posterior stem 

 cells come to lie together near the median plane, and are also budded 

 off toward the animal pole. Meanwhile x^-^ has been divided into equal 

 parts by a meridional plane, and these three cells assume a symmetrical 

 arrangement (fig. 48). I regret that I have not followed the division 

 of the members of the X group beyond this point. Figs. 53 and 55 

 show what is probably the next division of the posterior stem cells, 

 by means of which two large cells, x^-x", are separated off ventrally 

 and laterally. After the closure of the blastopore the posterior stem 

 cells each undergo a further subdivision into two cells by a meridional 

 cleavage. The four cells thus formed resemble in appearance the 

 "posterior teloblasts" of Nereis (Wilson, 1892). 



The lineage of those cells which lie on the vegetal pole side of the 

 posterior stem cells was followed as far as is indicated in the figures, but 

 a consideration of their cleavages is of little value, inasmuch as there 

 is no sign of a paratroch at the time when the blastopore closes, and 

 the cells on the ventral side of the embryo have by this time become 

 so small and thin as to be very difficult to distinguish satisfactorily. 



There are two points in connection with the cleavage of X which 

 require special mention. The first of these conceras the first four 




716 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



cleavages of X. These cleavages are essentiall}^ the same as those of X 

 in Ainphitrite and Clymenella (Mead, 1897) and Arenicola (Child, 1900). 

 This similarity extends not only to the direction of the cleavages, 

 but also to their products, which bear to one another a very similar 

 size relation. This striking resemblance cannot be ascribed to the 

 effect of alternating cleavages, since at the third cleavage this law is 

 violated in x^-^ at the fourth in X. The divisions of X in Dinophilus 

 and Nereis (Wilson, 1892) differ no more than do the corresponding 

 divisions in Nereis and other annelids {Amphitrite, etc.). These differ- 

 ences are, that in Nereis x^ is formed exactly in the dorsal mid-line, 

 and that the division of x^ is delayed, and is nearly equal when it occurs. 

 In all the Polychseta whose cytogeny is known (except Podarke) bilat- 

 erality appears in X at the fourth cleavage. It may then be said of 

 Dinophilus that bilaterality appears in the cell X in the same cell genera- 

 tion as in all polychcetous annelids investigated having the unequal type 

 of cleavage, and appears in x^ at the same cleavage as in at least three 

 polychcetous annelids. 



The second point concerns the arrangement of the cells of the X 

 group. In Nereis the main body of the descendants of X are so dis- 

 tributed that they come to lie on the vegetal pole side of the stem cells, 

 the latter remaining near the prototroch. In the other Polychaeta, up 

 to the time of the closure of the blastopore, the descendants of X are 

 uniformly distributed about the posterior stem cells, so that up to a 

 late stage the latter occupy a central position with regard to their 

 products. In Dinophilus, on the other hand, the greater part of the 

 descendants of X, up to the time when the blastopore is closed, are 

 distributed dorsal and lateral to the posterior stem cells. This pecu- 

 liarity is related to the peculiar shifting of areas, which has already 

 been briefly described in the chapter on the later development. This 

 distribution is not due entirely to a difference in the direction of the 

 division of X — though in Nereis two cells, x^ and x^, are budded of!" 

 toward the vegetal pole — but to a shifting of the cells among them- 

 selves. For example, in Amphitrite the cells x^ and x^ shift to the 

 vegetal pole side of X, while in Dinophilus the same cells always retain 

 a lateral position. 



The further history of this group, as far as I have been able to trace it, 

 is as follows. At a time near the closure of the blastopore, as shown in 

 fig. 55 and text fig. IV, E, the first quartette has been shifted forward 

 through nearly 90 degrees, being pushed forward through the forma- 

 tion of x^-x*, x'^-x"', etc., untU the descendants of these cells cover the 

 dorsal surf^ice of the embryo up to the limits of the first quartette and 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 717 



also cover a large portion of the lateral surface. Behind the blastopore 

 the descendants of X form a small group of cells, which in fig. 53 have 

 not yet covered in the primary mesoblasts. Mitotic activity in this 

 region has been very slight, as may be gathered from examination of 

 the optical section shown in fig. 54. The effect of active mitosis in 

 the posterior dorsal region is perceived in the thinness of the ectoderm 

 in this region. The X cells posterior to the blastopore appear to ad- 

 vance and fuse with the other ectoderm cells surrounding the blasto- 

 pore. Whether they actually form part of the blastopore I cannot at 

 present say, but judging from their position in fig. 55 it seems probable 

 that they do. The stomodseum is formed, as has already been stated, 

 at precisely the point where the blastopore closed. It then moves 

 rapidly forward to occupy the position shown in fig. 59. This move- 

 ment is caused b}"" the growth of the cells posterior to the blastopore, 

 which up to this time have been slow in dividing, as well as bj^ new 

 additions from the posterior stem cells. This ventral plate of cells 

 derived from X corresponds in origin and position to that group known 

 among the annelids as the "ventral plate." Examination of the ven- 

 tral side of an embryo at this stage shows numerous mitotic figures, 

 and the rapid growth of this region is testified to by the thinning of 

 the ventral ectoderm and by the dorsal flexure shown in figs. 59 and 60. 

 From this time on, it is e\ddent that the further growth of trunk 

 ectoderm is due entirely to growth of the cells of the X group, for, since 

 the appearance of the segments from in front backward indicates ter- 

 minal growth, it is evident that the descendants of X can alone be 

 concerned. 2d or X, then, contributes at least the larger part of the 

 trunk ectoderm, as is the case in all the polychaetous annelids whose 

 cell lineage has been studied. A larva of four segments is shown in 

 horizontal section in fig. 61. By comparison of this figure, which is 

 drawn to the same scale as the other figures, an adequate idea can be 

 obtained of the relatively enormous extent of the trunk ectoderm. 

 When it is recollected that this latter is formed principally, if not exclu- 

 sively, from 2d, without any addition of food material from the exterior, 

 the colossal size of 2d is very readily comprehended. A very similar 

 case is found in the development of Arenicola. In this form, as 

 already remarked, the first somatoblast is also unusually large, and 

 furnishes material for the first three segments of the adult worm. In 

 Dinophilus direct development has wholly supplanted the larval type, 

 since the material stored up in 2d forms six body segments, the 

 total number found in the adult. 




718 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



(2) 2a, 2b and 2c and the Third Quartette. 



The divisions of the cells 2a, 2b and 2c up to an advanced stage have 

 been described in dealing with the history of the prototroch. There is 

 left but one division to record, which I have observed only in 2a^-^ and 

 2c^-2. This division is shown in figs. 34 and 35. The plane of the 

 division is nearly equatorial, but inclined slightly in a leiotropic 

 direction in the C quadrant, in a dexiotropic direction in the A quad- 

 rant. Of the two products the lower is somewhat the smaller. I have 

 never witnessed a corresponding division in 2b^-^, but it very probably 

 occurs. The position and small size of this cell make it difficult to 

 study in the later stages. The two products of 2a^-^ and 2c^-^ respec- 

 tively are quite conspicuous up to an advanced stage, although they 

 probably divide into smaller cells just before the blastopore closes. 



The origin of the third quartette has been dealt with in the descrip- 

 tion of the cleavages. 3d is the largest cell in this quartette, 3b the 

 smallest, while 3a and 3c are intermediate in size. At the 40-cell stage 

 3d divides equally and leiotropically. The products of this division 

 are shown in fig. 22. A little later 3c divides, but in quite a different 

 manner, budding off a small cell toward the animal pole. The plane 

 of the division is equatorial (fig. 26). Next 3a also buds off a cell 

 toward the animal pole, the spindle being nearly vertical, though the 

 position of the products indicates a leiotropic division. 3b divides 

 some time after 3a, and here the spindle is decidedly leiotropic (fig. 34). 

 It is interesting to note that both 3b and 2b, in their respective quar- 

 tettes, are the most conservative in retaining the primitive direction 

 of their divisions. While 3a is in division, spindles are seen in 3d^ and 

 3d^ (fig. 27). These cells bud off tiny cells toward the animal pole (fig. 

 32). Of these latter that derived from 3d^ is the smaller. The spindles 

 for this division are nearly vertical, but sufficiently inclined to make the 

 division leiotropic, in direct violation to the law of alternating cleav- 

 ages. Even before 3b has completed its first division 3c has budded 

 off another cell toward the animal pole, the spindle being inclined 

 dexiotropically, as it should be according to the law of alternating 

 cleavages (fig. 34). With this di\dsion, or rather the one which follows 

 it, i.e., that of 3b, I have ceased to follow the cell-lineage of the entire 



egg. 



In fig. 53 the position of the cells 2a--i, 2a----, 2c-2-i, and 2c2-2-2 is 

 clearly seen. Each pair of cells form a portion of the lateral margin 

 of the blastopore; 2a^-^-^ and 2c^-^\ which formerly were above, that 

 is, to the animal pole side of 2si^-^-^ and 2c---, now lie anterior to them. 

 They still, however, maintain their relative position in the ectoderm, 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 719 



and their changed relation to the entoderm and the X group is the 

 result of the shifting of the ectoderm already described. A clear idea 

 of the change of position of the cells in question may be obtained from 

 a glance at text fig. IV, A-D. The corresponding cells in the B quad- 

 rant have not been seen. Doubtless 2b^-^ divides, as do 2a2-- and 2c^-^, 

 though at a much later period, but the products of such a division are 

 not to be recognized in fig. 53. In the embryo represented in the 

 figure the trochoblasts can plainly be discerned dorsal to 2a^-^-^ and 

 '2c^-^-S' on the ventral side of the embryo they form an irregular cell 

 row. Below this there is a group of small cells which presents to the 

 eye no definite arrangement. These represent the descendants of 

 2b^-^; 3a and 3b. Posterior to the blastopore are those cells which in 

 annelids form the ventral plate. These cells barely cover the posterior 

 face of the primary mesoblasts. Just posterior to 2a^-^-^ and 2c^-^-^ are 

 one or two small cells on each side whose lineage has not been deter- 

 mined, but which are probably descendants of 3d and 3c, Tmriing to 

 fig. 55, the relations of the cells surrounding the blastopore are much 

 less clear. On each side of the anterior portion of the blastopore are 

 two cells slightly larger than those surrounding them. These are 

 probably the descendants of 2a2-2-\ 2si''-^-\ 2c'-^-'- and 2c2-2-2. The 

 blastopore has meanwhile narrowed to an irregular cleft, the cells 

 anterior to it forming a seam, while the cells of the ventral plate have 

 only advanced sufficiently to cover in one of the mesoblasts and part 

 of the other. All of the cells which constitute the rim of the blastopore 

 are small and extremely thin and transparent, making their outlines 

 very difficult to discern, and the exact lineage of any of these impossible 

 to determine. From a comparison of figs. 53 and 55 it is seen that the 

 cells of the ectoderm have crowded toward the vegetal pole from all 

 directions, but especially from the sides. It is also evident that the 

 anterior portion of the margin of the blastopore, between 2a?'^-^ and 

 2c^ -^ is composed of the descendants of 2b^-2, 3b and 3c; that the 

 lateral margin is at least partly composed of the descendants of 2a and 

 2c, unless the small cells which form the blastopore rim in fig. 55 have 

 all slipped in around 22i^-^-^, 2a---, 2c^-^-^ and 2c---. It seems probable 

 that this is not the case, but that the small cells comprising the lateral 

 margin of the blastopore are derived from the second quartette. It is, 

 however, fairly certain that some small cells have pushed in between 

 the descendants of 2a and 2c and the cells of the X group. These must 

 be the descendants of 3c on one side and 3d on the other. 



In Nereis, Wilson (1892) described these cells 2a^ 2c- and 2b^ as 

 ^'stomatoblasts," since they converge to form an arc of cells as the 




720 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



blastopore closes, and are concerned in the formation of the stomo- 

 dseum. Mead (1897) states that in Ajnphitrite 2a^ 2b2 and 2c^ come 

 to occupy positions similar to the "stomatoblasts" of Nereis, but is 

 in doubt as to their precise fate. In Capitella, Eisig (1898) finds that 

 the margin of the blastopore is composed entirely of the products of the 

 second quartette ("oesophagoblasts"). In Podarke (Treadwell, 1901) 

 at least one cell from the second quartette forms a portion of the stomo- 

 dgeal wall, as do also products of 3a, 3b and 3c. In Arenicola (Child, 

 1900) eight products from the third quartette function as stomato- 

 blasts and form an arc of cells similar to that formed by the stomato- 

 blasts of Nereis. 



Various conditions are found among the MoDusca. In Ischnochiton 

 (Heath, 1899) products of both the second and the third quartettes 

 take part in the formation of the blastopore lips; this appears to be 

 also the case in Planorhis (Holmes, 1901), while in Trochus (Robert, 

 1903) the lips are formed at first by cells derived from both the second 

 and third quartettes, but later the products of the second quartette 

 are excluded from the rim of the blastopore. 



In conclusion, it may be said that in Dinophilus no one set of cells 

 can be denominated stomatoblasts, but that products from both the 

 second and third quartettes take part in the formation of the blasto- 

 pore rim. The products of 2b^-^, 3a and 3b, since they lie immediately 

 in front of the blastopore, probably contribute to the formation of the 

 stomodseum. The fate of the cells 2a^---^ 2a^-^-^, 2c^-2-^ and 2c^-^-- is 

 problematical. It is possible that they, too, contribute to the forma- 

 tion of the stomodseal wall. On the other hand, it seems pretty certain 

 that but a small part of 3c and 3d contribute to the formation of the 

 stomodseum. Their position, just anterior to the cells of the X group, 

 which is not materially altered during the shifting of the ectoderm., 

 together with their large size, makes it possible that they contribute 

 largely to the lateral ectoderm of the head. 



Mesoblast of ectodermal origin (larval mesoblast, Lillie; paedomcso- 

 blast, Eisig) has been described for a number of Mollusca, and the 

 annelids Podarke (Treadwell, 1901), Capitella (Eisig, 1898), Aricia 

 (Wilson, 1898) and Thalassema (Torrey, 1903). Schimkewitsch (1895) 

 describes cells from the ectoderm in the anterior part of the Dinophilus 

 embryo as migrating into the body cavity and there contributing to 

 the mesenchyme. Certain cells, of whose exact lineage I am ignorant, 

 belonging to the first quartette, do invaginate (figs. 57 and 58), and it 

 is quite possible that one or more of them may give rise to the mesen- 

 chyme of the head and the mouth segment region; but it is my belief 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 721 



that ectomesoblast, if such exists, is very small in amount, and that 

 the greater part, if not all, of the mesenchyme of the adult as well as 

 the ovaries are formed from 4d. 



VIII. — History of the Fourth and Fifth Quartettes. 

 (1) The Entomeres. 



The entoderm, at the time 4d is formed (fig. 17), consists of 2A, 2B, 

 IC and 3D. The origin of the third quartette and the primary meso- 

 blast cell 4d have already been described. The other three members 

 of the fourth quartette arise by an equal and leiotropic cleavage. 

 Figs. 23 and 24 show the origin of 4c, fig. 29 that of 4a, while figs. 33 

 and 41 show 4b already formed. At the 72-ceU stage 4D has divided 

 dexiotropically into 5D and 5d (fig. 33), the latter product being the 

 smaller. The inequality of this di\dsion compensates, so to speak, for 

 the inequality of the division preceding, since at the completion of 

 the seventh cleavage the original macromeres 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D are 

 alike in size. After the division of 4D, 4C, 4A and 4B divide equally 

 and dexiotropically to form the fifth quartette (figs. 51 and 52). The 

 original macromeres now form a cross, the arms of which lie radially. 

 Since up to the last division the macromeres lay interradially, it is 

 e\ddent that a rotation of the macromeres through an arc of 45 degrees 

 has been brought about. This rotation has taken place in an anti- 

 clockwise direction, viewing the ovum from the animal pole, as can be 

 seen by a comparison of figs. 50 and 52. This movement is due to the 

 reduction in size of the macromeres and their superficial position at 

 the seventh cleavage. During this cleavage the members of the fifth 

 quartette are, on the other hand, held in place by their greater surface 

 contact with the surrounding cells of the egg, so that the macromeres 

 oA, etc., are rotated, as were the members of the first quartette at the 

 time of their origin. A similar rotation apparently occurs also in 

 Amphitrite, Clymenella (Mead, 1897) and Arenicola (Child, 1900). 



After the division of the fourth quartette the entomeres cease divid- 

 ing and enter a resting stage which continues until after the closure of 

 the blastopore. They now form a thick, roughly ovoid mass of cells, 

 fourteen in number. At the centre of this mass on the ventral side 

 (fig. 52) lie the four macromeres, 5D posterior, 5B anterior, while 5C 

 and 5A lie lateralh'. Alternating with the macromeres are the four 

 members of the fifth quartette, while at the outer ends of the cross 

 formed by the macromeres lie the three pairs of entomeres belonging 

 to the fourth quartette. This relation is very similar to that described 




722 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



by Wilson (1892) for Aricia. In both cases this arrangement is prob- 

 ably brought about by the mechanical processes involved in spiral 

 cleavage. Each cell approximates in shape a four-sided prism, the 

 nuclei lying in the lower ends of the cells, near their ventral surface. 

 As the blastopore narrows, however, these nuclei begin to move 

 inward (figs. 54 and 56). This movement is associated with a change 

 in shape of the entomeres, which in turn is part of the process of gas- 

 trulation. As the blastopore lips draw together (figs. 53 and 55) the 

 lower or vegetal pole ends of the entomeres grow smaller, while the 

 upper or animal pole ends become larger (figs. 54 and 56). These cells 

 thus change from a prismatic to a pyramidal shape. Viewed in a sagit- 

 tal optical section their outlines radiate fanwise from the blastopore 

 (fig. 56). This condition is figured by Repiachoff (1886) and also by 

 Schimkewitsch (1895). This peculiar phenomenon may be a remi- 

 niscence of a time when the type of gastrulation was embolic and not 

 epibolic, and the latter condition may have been brought about by 

 acquisition of food yolk diu-ing the phylogeny. Such acquisition of 

 yolk is a secondary character commonly associated with a change 

 from larval to direct development, and it is perfectly possible that a 

 change from emboly to epiboly may have been brought about in this 

 manner. The nuclei have meanwhile undergone changes in structure 

 as well as in position. The chromatin, which before was distributed 

 in the nuclear vesicles in the form of small granules, is now concentrated 

 in each vesicle in one deep staining chromatin nucleolus (fig. 56). This 

 condition is not an uncommon one in resting cells, and is also seen in 

 the entomeres of Crepidula (Conklin, 1897, figs. 52, 53 and 54). 



The fm-ther history of the entoderm I have not been able to follow 

 in detail. At a period when the stomodseum has assumed the position 

 of the definitive mouth, the entoderm cells are seen to have multiplied 

 somewhat and to have assumed an arrangement qmte different from 

 that found in earlier stages. In fig. 57, which is a horizontal, optical 

 section of a stage when the stomodseum is just making its appearance, 

 the entoderm cells have still the radial arrangement which they as- 

 sumed at the time of the closure of the blastopore. In fig. 59, a sagittal 

 section of a much later stage, the arrangement is totally different; 

 the entoderm cells have multiplied and are now arranged in a more 

 or less definite layer about a small central lumen. 



(2) The Mesomeres. 



At the 29-cell stage 4d is but just formed and lies on the lower side 

 of the clea\dng ovum, below and in front of X and to the left of the 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 723 



mid-line. Very soon after its formation 4cl divides again. This divi- 

 sion parts it, by a bilateral cleavage, into two equal cells, the primary 

 mcsomeres M and M. This division is illustrated in figs. 28 and 44. 

 The primary mesomeres remain undivided up to the 72-cell stage, when 

 they undergo a division of great interest. This division is shown in 

 figs. 33 and 36. By it two small cells are budded off anteriorly toward 

 the vegetal pole, and close to the line of juncture of the two mesomeres. 

 This division is, however, not bilaterally symmetrical, but is, on the 

 other hand, plainly dcxiotropic, and follows the law of alternating cleavages. 

 The product of the left mesomere thus lies in the furrow formed by 

 the juncture of the two mesomeres and the entomeres 5D and 5d. 

 The product of the right mesomeres, on the other hand, lies between 

 its parent cell and 5D. The next division of the mesomeres (fig. 50) 

 is also not symmetrical. By this division the left mesomere buds off 

 a small cell on its left anterior surface, that is, leiotropically ; on the 

 other hand, the right mesomere violates the law of spiral cleavage by 

 dividing in the same direction as before and placing a small cell to 

 the left of its first product (fig. 50). The next division marks the 

 beginning of true teloblastic cleavages. Each mesomere in this divi- 

 sion buds off dorsally and laterally a small cell. Just how many of 

 these divisions occur before the closure of the blastopore I cannot say, 

 but probably not more than two. After the closure of the blastopore 

 the mesomeres begin to shift apart, moving laterally, forward and 

 somewhat dorsally. In the horizontal optical section shown in fig. 57 

 they have reached a position which, I think, is their final one. In this 

 movement they not only have changed their position with regard to one 

 another, but also with regard to the median plane of the embryo. Up 

 to the time of the closure of the blastopore the mesomeres are situated 

 at the left of the ventral mid-line, but, as shown in fig. 57, at the 

 close of this movement the mesomeres are bilaterally situated with 

 respect to the median plane of the embryo. 



The cavise of this shifting apart is not clear, but I think it is to be 

 explained by the peculiar shape of the entomeres. These are, at the 

 time the blastopore closes, pyramidal in form, with their apices at 

 the blastopore. This point, as will be seen by reference to figs. 53 

 and 55, is just anterior to the junction of the mesomeres. After the 

 ectoderm of the ventral plate has enclosed the mesomeres, they are 

 subjected to a pressure from the ectoderm which tends to force them 

 inward against the narrow ends of the entomeres. These latter press 

 in between the mesomeres and wedge them apart. They are, however, 

 prevented from passing backwards, and in fact compelled to move 




724 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADE:MY OF [Oct., 



forward, ])y contact with the cells of the X group. In Thalassema there 

 occurs a similar shifting apart of the mesomeres, which Torrey (1903) 

 also explains as being caused by pressure of the entomeres. 



The position occupied by the mesomeres is at first sight somewhat 

 different from that occupied by similar cells among the mollusks and 

 annelids. In the majority of these forms the mesomeres, soon after 

 their formation, are invaginated into the cleavage cavity. In Dino- 

 philus they remain on the exterior until covered by ectoderm, when 

 they move laterally to the entoderm. There was, however, at an 

 early stage a cleavage cavity between the ectoderm and the entoderm, 

 and had the mesomeres moved into it, then their behavior w^ould have 

 been that of the corresponding ceUs in most mollusks and annelids. 

 As it is, their migration into the cleavage cavity is postponed until a 

 later period of the history of the embryo, but their final position is 

 not essentially different from that of other forms. 



In fig. 57 a band of mesoblast ceUs is seen on each side of the ento- 

 derm, running forward from the mesomeres, which are in division. 

 The mesoblast is also shown in fig. 59 ventral to the entoderm. 



The later history of the mesoblast has not been followed out in detail. 

 It is my hope to be able at a later period to determine precisely to 

 what organs and tissues the mesomeres contribute, but it seems fairly 

 certain that they give rise to the mesenchyme and sex organs (ovaries) 

 of the adult. 



Of especial interest would be the fate of the first two products of 

 each mesomere, in the light of the discovery made by Conklin (1897) 

 that part of 4d is in Crepidula entodermal. 



Following Conklin's discovery, Wilson (1897) in Nereis, Treadwell 

 (1901) in Podarke and Torrey (1903) in Thalassema found that part 

 of the mesomeres in these forms was entodermal. I have not been 

 able to follow^ out the fate of the first two products of each meso- 

 mere, since their small size and position causes them to become inextri- 

 cably blended with the ectodermal cells surrounding the posterior lip 

 of the blastopore. The position of three of these cells in the mid-line 

 suggests, however, that their fate nia.y be different from that of the 

 other products of the mesomeres. 



IX.— Axial Relations. 



The discussion of the axial relations of the DinopMlus embryo falls 

 naturally under two heads, viz.: (1) The relation of the first and second 

 cleavage planes to the future median plane of the adult, and (2) the 

 shifting of areas which occurs in relation to the closure of the blasto- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 725 



pore. Both of these questions have received much attention from 

 embryologists, and have been so thoroughly discussed by the writers 

 on cell-lineage that it would be superfluous for me to attempt here to 

 treat the subject at length, and so I shall confine myself to stating what 

 these relations are in the Dinophihis embryo and to comparing them 

 with a few other forms. 



As alread}^ mentioned, the cell 2d is of very great value as a landmark. 

 From its origin up to the time w^hen the last traces of it are seen, it 

 marks the posterior end of the embryo. Of course it may be said that 

 since the first three cleavages are of the spiral type, and not of the 

 bilateral type, and since x^ and x- arc not exactly equal in size, that the 

 centre of 2d before these cleavages could not well be situated at the 

 same point as that of 2d after them. This, however, is not a point of 

 practical importance. To all intents and purposes the centre of the 

 cell 2d lies in the future median plane of the embryo. The animal and 

 vegetal poles lie in this plane, so that its relation to the cleaving egg 

 can now be determined. 



2d, after its formation, lies in the furrow between Ic and ID. A 

 glance at the figures from fig. 10 to fig. 33 shows that the second cleav- 

 age plane between the macromcres, up to the 72-ccll stage (fig. 33), very 

 nearly coincides with the median plane of the embryo, since both 2d 

 and the vegetal pole lie in this furrow. At the 72-cell stage, however, 

 these relations are beginning to undergo a change. As described under 

 the history of the entomeres, the macromeres undergo a rotation 

 through 45 degrees, bringing 5D and 5B into the former plane of the 

 second cleavage. This point will be made clear by reference to figs. 

 50 and 52. The median plane of the embryo and adult then passes 

 through 5B and 5D, and forms an angle of 45 degrees with the plane of 

 the second cleavage between the original macromeres. In conclusion, 

 it follows, since 2d marks the posterior region of the embryo, and since 

 during the early cleavage stages it lies in the furrow between the pos- 

 terior macromeres, that the second cleavage plane does coincide in a 

 general way with the future sagittal plane of the embryo, although it 

 is evident that at the 4-cell stage the cleavage plane between C and I) 

 must pass to the right of the sagittal plane of the embiyo. This 

 result is at variance with the results obtained among the Annelida by 

 most writers, though Wilson (1892) found that the second cleavage 

 coincides with the sagittal plane of the future embryo. Much import- 

 ance, however, cannot be attached to these relations of the entomeres 

 with the embryo, since they arc the result of shif tings between the 

 macromeres and micromercs, which may occur at an early period. In 




726 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Dinophilus, for example, the members of the first quartette when' first 

 formed lie in the furrows between the macromeres ; at the next cleav- 

 age they are shifted in a sinistral direction, so that they lie precisely 

 over their parent macromeres (cf. figs. 8 and 10), and this relative 

 position is retained up to the formation of the fifth quartette. In 

 Amphitrite (Mead, 1897) and Arenicola (Child, 1900) this sinistral 

 rotation does not bring the micromeres so precisely over the corres- 

 ponding macromeres. 



In considering the relation of the cleavage plane with the embryonic 

 axis, the micromeres are of far more importance than the macromeres. 

 An examination of the figures of the later cleavages will show that the 

 planes of the first and second cleavages as traced over the entire embryo 

 do not coincide with its transverse and sagittal planes, but that here 

 the rule laid down by Lillie (1895) holds good, viz.: "The members of 

 the odd generations of ectomeres, as well as the entomeres, are 

 distributed two each, right and left of the middle line; those of the 

 even generations are placed anterior, posterior, right and left." 



The shifting of the axis, which is largely concerned in bringing about 

 the closure of the blastopore, has been already described in chapter V. 

 It was there spoken of as a forward movement of the first quartette, 

 or rather of the ectoderm of the anterior half of the embryo. This 

 shifting, I think, might better be looked upon as a shifting backward 

 of the ectoderm of the posterior half of the embr3'o. considering the 

 animal pole as the fixed point. In the first case the blastopore would 

 be closed from in front backward; in the latter from behind forward, 

 which brings it into line with what we know of other forms. In either 

 case the egg axis is bent through an angle of nearly 90 degrees, but not 

 quite, since the am'mal pole is, as Wilson (1892) showed to be the case 

 in Nereis, probably slightly dorsal to the anterior pole of the embryo. 

 This shifting of areas during the process of gastrulation is almost pre- 

 cisely similar to that which occurs in Crepidula, as described by Conk- 

 lin (1897). There is in that form a bending of the egg axis through 

 90 degrees, and also caused by rapid growth of the cells of the D quad- 

 rant, which pushes forward the ectoderm of the aboral sm-face over the 

 entoderm, the vegetative pole being apparentl}^ the fixed point. This 

 condition is attributed by Conklin to the accumulation of yolk in the 

 entoderm cells, and doubtless this is the cause of the similar relations 

 existing between entoderm and ectoderm in Dinophilus, the solid 

 yolk-laden mass of entoderm cells altering their form and relative 

 positions but little, while the ectoderm is shifted over them.

X. — The Phylogenetic Relationships of Dinophilus in the 

 Light of Its Early Development. 



In this chapter I wish to briefly compare the early development of 

 Dinophilus with that of other groups, and to consider what light a 

 study of its cell-lineage sheds on its systematic position. That the 

 study of cell-lineage is of value in determining relationship has been 

 abundantly shown by the results accomplished in this particular branch 

 of zoological research. These have in a most striking degree corrobo- 

 rated the results attained by the study of comparative anatomy, and 

 have further shown that in a large number of forms, representative of 

 large and important groups, the characters of the various forms as 

 manifested in the cleavage are as constant as the anatomical characters, 

 and must therefore be as truly inherited. Furthermore, since coeno- 

 genetic changes may be supposed to affect the later stage of develop- 

 ment first, w^e may expect to find the earlier stages retaining longer their 

 primitive characters, although even the earliest stages have been 

 affected by precocious segregation and are no longer highlj' primitive. 

 The study of the early development cannot be regarded as a sure or 

 certain guide in determining relationship in every case, yet it ma}^ 

 I think, be very properly called to aid in the determination of the 

 relationships of doubtful forms. In the case of Dinophilus, the cleav- 

 age has presented such startling and accurate resemblances to the 

 chsetopod annelids that it seems impossible that they do not indicate 

 relationship, for so many and minute correspondences could hardly 

 have arisen independently. I have already stated these resemblances 

 separately, but wish here to bring them together, in order that their 

 force may be more apparent. 



In the first place the manner of origin of the germ layers — ectoderm 

 arising from the first three quartettes, mesoderm from the left posterior 

 member of the fourth quartette, and entoderm from the remaining 

 cells — brings Dinophilus into a list of forms already large and still 

 increasing, containing members of the LamelHbranchia, Gasteropoda, 

 Polychseta and Echiuridae. In common with many Annelida and 

 Mollusca the larger part (or all) of the ectoderm of the trunk is 

 derived from one cell, the posterior member of the second quartette. 

 A little later the resemblances to the annelids become more marked. 

 In the development of the second preoral ciliated band of Dinophilus 

 is recognized the prototroch of the trochophore, and the earliest rudi- 

 ment of the brain appears at the same point as the annelid "Scheitel- 

 platte." There are, however, in the cleavages themselves resem- 

 blances to the cleavage of the polychate annelids which are most 




728 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



striking, viz., in the origin of the bilateral cleavages. In the cross 

 and in the products of 2d the transition from the spiral type of 

 cleavage to the more specialized bilateral type occurs in precisely 

 the same cells and in precisely the same directions as in the Poly- 

 chaeta. Moreover, the second bilateral divisions of the cells of the 

 posterior arms of the cross continue this resemblance. All these 

 characters, if such they may be called, when viewed as a whole, 

 point in no uncertain way to a descent from the annelid stem, and at 

 a point not far from that at which the Pol3^choeta arose. 



If we consider, as I think at present we must, that the trochophorc 

 is a larval form common at least to the Annelida, we cannot regard the 

 development of Dinophilus as primitive. This view is upheld by many 

 features of the cleavage, especially by the many departures from the 

 spiral type exemplified in the divisions of the primary trochoblasts 

 and many other cells, and also in the discrepancy between the size of 

 2b and 3b as compared with their sister cells. Further evidence of 

 secondary change is found in the enormous size of 2d and 4d, which 

 have acquired a very large amount of cytoplasm in order to supply 

 material to build up the trunk region, which in the trochophore is 

 ordinarily acquired from the exterior through active feeding. Besides 

 these there is the retarded development of the adult organs, which do 

 not become functional until the animal is nearly ready to hatch, but 

 which must have been primitively functional at a much earlier period. 

 Such organs are the intestine and prototroch. The latter, together 

 with the rosette, and possibly the perianal band of cilia, which may 

 represent the paratroch, are the sole relics of organs peculiar to the 

 trochophore. It is to be regarded as doubtful if even these would now 

 be recognizable, were it not for the fact that these are also concerned 

 in the formation of adult organs. How quickly such a larval organ as 

 the prototroch may disappear is illustrated in the development of 

 Sternaspis (Child, 1900), where the prototroch has entirely disappeared, 

 though this larval organ is highly developed in related forms. Thus 

 in the light of the cleavage, as well as in that afforded by the more 

 recent work on the anatomy of Dinophilus, Metschnikoff's conjecture 

 appears almost prophetic. Dinophilus probably is to be regarded as a 

 "stationare Annelidenlarva," but one in which the larval stage has 

 become an end stage toward which the development tends and which 

 has become correspondingly modified.

Postscript. 



Since the above paper was presented for publication there have come 

 to hand two papers by Prof. John H. Gerould: " The Development of 

 Phascolosoma " (Arch. Zool. exp. et gen. 11, 2, 1904) and " Studies on 

 the Embryology of the Sipunculidse : I. The Embryonal Envelope 

 and Its Homologies " (Mark Anniversary Volume, Art. XXII). In 

 the former of these two papers Prof Gerould shows that in Phasco- 

 losoma the ectoderm arises from the first three quartettes of micro- 

 meres, the mesoderm from 4d, and the entoderm from the remaining 

 cells, thus adding a representative of the SipunculidjE to the list of 

 forms mentioned in section IV (4) of the present paper. The author 

 further points out the presence of a typical annelid "cross" and 

 ^'rosette" in Phascolosoma , that the prototroch of the larva is formed 

 from the sixteen "primary trochoblasts," and that the "somatic 

 plate" arises from 2d. The .second paper mentioned, among other 

 interesting facts concerning the relation of the larva of Sipuncidus 

 and Phascolosoma, establishes the homology of the "serosa" of 

 Phascolosoma with the prototroch of SipunculKs.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURE OF THE LARVA OF PARAGORDIUS. 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR., 

 Professor of Zoology in the University of Texas. 



The embryology of the Gordiacea is a subject full of mystery and 

 interest, notwithstanding the attempts at its solution. It is one 

 fraught with technical difficulties, and one where the obtaining of 

 material is usually a matter of chance. With a peculiar delight then, 

 after many vain attempts to collect the eggs, I found in March and 

 April of the present year numerous adults of both sexes, with egg- 

 strings in abundance, of Paragordius varius (Leidy) in a small stream 

 that passes through the town of Austin, Texas. 



Ovipositing females were brought to the laboratory, and the egg- 

 strings kept for weeks in small jars of water aerated by plants. The 

 full-formed larval stage is reached in from ten to twelve days, and 

 these larvse live for more than a week longer before they leave the 

 egg-membranes. After leaving the latter they live for only a few 

 days unless they reach their proper host. 



In Texas, as in Pennsylvania, the last host is the large cricket 

 (Acheta ahhreviata) ; in this host are found individuals from about one- 

 third the ultimate size to the adult stage. As is well known for all 

 the species of Gordiacea, the adults leave their terminal hosts and come 

 into the water, where the eggs are fertilized and laid. Whether the 

 cricket is the only host of Paragordius varius, or whether there is a pre- 

 ceding one into which the larva first enters, I have not yet been able 

 to determine. Attempts were made to infect crickets with larvse, by 

 crushing the egg-strings containing the latter so as to liberate the larva', 

 and placing drops of water filled with the larvse upon grass fed to the 

 crickets. None of the adult crickets lived longer than a month in 

 confinement; and each one out of about 75 kept under observation 

 was examined in vain at the time of its death for Paragordius larvae. 

 Crushed egg-strings were placed in water containing Amphipods 

 (Gammarids) ; at the end of two weeks the Amphipods showed numer- 

 ous larvse encysted in the intestine and musculatm-e, but these larvse 

 underwent no further development. Terrestrial Isopods (Oniscus) 

 found in damp places were placed in contact with water containing 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 739 



larvae, and such water was dropped upon their mouths; two weeks 

 later a single one of them showed a single larva in the intestine, en- 

 cysted but dead. Pieces of egg-strings were placed in aquaria with 

 brook minnows ; the fish some three weeks later showed larvae encysted 

 in the intestine, and a few in the muscles, but here again no further 

 development of the larvse was obtained. Finally infection attempts 

 were made with tadpoles of Bufo. The first lot of tadpoles were small 

 (but operculum present), and crushed egg-strings were placed in their 

 water on April 12; most of the tadpoles died between the 16th and the 

 18th of April, the last on the 19th; the autopsy showed large numbers 

 of larvse (not encysted) in the intestine, but most if not all of the larva) 

 were dead. About the same results were reached with two other lots. 

 Larvae placed in water containing mosquito larvae {Culex) encysted 

 themselves in the mosquitoes and soon caused their death. 



These results are, of course, quite indecisive, except in showing that 

 mosquito larvse and toad tadpoles cannot be normal hosts of the 

 parasites. So I have not been able to secure the early post-larval 

 development of Paragordius, and in the present contribution shall 

 deal with that literatm-e only which concerns the development up 

 to the larval stage. 



Since the ultimate host is a land insect, while the parasites are at 

 first aquatic, it is of value to determine how long the mature worms 

 can withstand desiccation. One adult female within a few hours after 

 emerging from a cricket was placed in a dry dish ; four hours afterward 

 she was alive, but with dry cuticle; eighteen hours afterward she was 

 shriveled up and did not resuscitate on being placed in water. Several 

 adult females, a few hours after escaping from crickets, were placed in 

 an open dish on moist filter paper; twenty-four hours afterward they 

 were still alive though the body surface was dry, and on placing them 

 in water they lived for several days. Egg-strings when dried shrivel 

 up and the eggs die quickly. 



Portions of egg-strings at timed periods were preserved in three 

 fixatives: Zenker's fluid, made up of 5 per cent, of corrosive sublimate 

 and 5 per cent, of glacial acetic acid in :\Iuller's solution (bichromate 

 of potash 2 parts, sulphate of soda 1 part, water 100 parts) ; a mixture 

 of 95 per cent, alcohol, 3 per cent, nitric acid, and aqueous solution of 

 corrosive sublimate in equal parts; and a mixture of glacial acetic 

 acid 10 parts, and 95 per cent, alcohol 90 parts. The fixation with 

 Zenker's fluid is by far the best of these, producing no distortion and 

 preserving admirably doJicate cellular details. To my surprise I found, 

 contrary to the results of other workers, that the ova, despite their 




740 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct.. 



membranes, are readily penetrated, and that all alcoholic and strong- 

 acid sohitions are to be avoided. Flemming's fluid (osmic acid, acetic 

 acid and chromic acid) penetrates easily, but blackens the tissues too 

 quickly. A fixation of three to twenty hours in Zenker's fluid is 

 followed by rinsing in distilled water for fully the same length of time ; 

 then the egg-strings are brought through successive alcohol grades up 

 to 83 per cent. They remain in the latter for several days, then arc 

 brought down gradually to distilled water. With each egg-string in a 

 narrow, round-bottomed vial, I take a glass rod and thoroughly crush 

 the egg-string in water after it has been well hardened in alcohol ; thus 

 the eggs are easily freed from each other and none are lost. An 

 aqueous stain is then poured upon them; and for material fixed in 

 Zenker's fluid I found Delafield's hsematoxyline, diluted with an equal 

 volume of water, for two to three hours, the best. The ova, still within 

 the same \'ial, are brought up through successive grades of alcohol to 

 absolute alcohol, half an hour in each grade; then into a mixture of 

 equal parts of absolute alcohol and xylol ; then into pure xjdol. They 

 are then mounted in Canada balsam. These methods have been given 

 in detail, because only after numerous failures have I been able to 

 secure fine preparations. In the structure of the larva much can be 

 determined by study of it in life. And one can best investigate the 

 armature of the proboscis by causing it to be permanently evaginated 

 through treatment with a rather strong aqueous solution of caustic 

 potash ; this swells up the whole body. Sections were made of numer- 

 ous egg-strings, but the paraffine imbedding causes great distortion 

 of the cells, and it is necessary to imbed for several hours. The 

 whole mounts of the ova and larvae were the most instructive. 



1. The Early Development. 



The structure of the adult reproductive organs has been previously 

 described by me (1903) in detail, and it is necessary here to recall only 

 a few points to make the development clear. The ovaries are a pair 

 of long tubes extending nearly the entire length of the body, each con- 

 sisting of a longitudinal tube, the "uterus" of the authors, and of very 

 numerous lateral diverticula or pouches, "ovaries" in the narrow 

 sense, each of which communicates by an aperture with the uterus. 

 The posterior ends of the two uteri are ciliated, and are termed the 

 oviducts, and these open into the atrium, into the anterior end of 

 which opens also the large receptaculum seminis. The end of the 

 intestine communicates with the atrium, and from that point to the 

 posterior end of the body extends the tubular cloaca, with the cloacal 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 741 



aperture between the three tail lobes. The atrium is Hnecl with a 

 glandular epithelium, as is also the proximal end of the cloaca; the 

 remainder of the cloaca bears a cuticular lining. 



The egg-cells contained in the lateral diverticula of the ovaries 

 of adult females (individuals whose external cuticula is of a dark color) 

 are all ovocytes of the first order at the end of the growth period (fig. 1, 

 PI. XLIX). The nucleus is more or less central in position, contains 

 one large deeply staining nucleolus, and a nuclear sap which shows no 

 trace of chromatin and only in a few cases exceedingly delicate linin 

 fibres: even strong iron haematoxyline stains fail to demonstrate chro- 

 matin particles. The cell-body evinces a zone of yolk globules (shaded 

 in figs. 1 and 15), placed near the periphery; while the cytoplasm is 

 coarsely alveolar, and the meshes of very regular size in the perinuclear 

 area. 



While these ovocytes are passing from the "ovaries" to the "uteri," 

 but before they have entered the latter, their nuclei are in prophases 

 of the first maturation mitosis; such stages are shown in figs. 2-5. 

 The nucleolus becomes smaller and stains less intensely, while there 

 appear, usually close to it, chromosomes in the form of long loops 

 (figs. 2, 3) ; these do not first appear simultaneously, but successively. 

 These chromosomes shorten into the form of minute dumbbell-shaped 

 bodies, seven in number (fig. 4), and for the first time is seen in the 

 nucleus an achromatic network (fig. 5). These are bivalent chromo- 

 somes, as shown by their shape and by the fact that there are fourteen 

 single chromosomes in the cells of the embryo. Two points are 

 remarkable in regard to them: first, that no trace of them is to be seen 

 in the preceding rest stage; and second, that they appear in succession 

 close to the nucleolus, and later are frequently found in a compact 

 group — a condition infrequent in a prophase. The evidence is that 

 these chromosomes come out of the nucleolus, and that during the rest 

 stage they are contained within it. Such a condition has recently 

 been demonstrated for the egg of Asterias by Hartmann (1902); but 

 that it is by no means a usual condition in Metazoa, on the contrary is 

 decidedly unusual, was previously shown by me (1898). As the ovo- 

 cyte enters the uterus the seven double chromosomes are arranged in 

 the equator of the first polar spindle (fig. 6; fig. 7, a pole view of the 

 spindle); this has the form of the corresponding spindle of Ascaris, 

 and no centrosomes arc demonstrable. As the ovocytes, closely com- 

 pacted together, are propelled rapidly backward along the uteri and 

 so through the oviducts into the atrium, the spindle moves gradually 

 nearer the periphery of the egg. 




742 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



The females are impregnated with sperm, and the receptaculum 

 seminis filled with a great mass of it, before the ovocytes enter the 

 uteri, so before the first polar spindle is formed. This I have proved 

 by examination of numerous adult females. There is an intimate 

 coition, the male placing his cloacal aperture against that of the female ; 

 and the sperm has to traverse the length of the cloaca before reaching 

 the receptaculum. Ova w^ill apparently not develop unless fertilized, 

 for there was no development at all in the egg-string of a female whose 

 receptaculum was wdthout spermatozoa. In the testes of the adult 

 male only mature spermatozoa arc present, and in this species there 

 appears to be no spermatophores. 



When the ovocytes reach the atrium they become surrounded by 

 the minute flagellate spermatozoa issuing from the receptaculum, 

 and in the posterior part of the atrium and the proximal end of the 

 cloaca the sperm enters the egg (fig. 6). The pole spindle is now ex- 

 centric; the spermatozoon enters usually at a point of the periphery 

 furthest removed from the spindle, but sometimes quite near it (fig. 

 6). On strongly destained hsem.atoxyHne preparations the spermato- 

 zoon head is sharply distinguishable. The ovocytes are propelled 

 backward within the cloaca compacted into an egg-string. While the 

 ovarian egg has a limiting membrane of very delicate nature, the egg 

 in the proximal part of the cloaca has a thicker membrane that stains 

 with haematoxylinc (fig. 6) ; this increases in thickness as the egg pro- 

 gresses backward and becomes the outermost envelope of the egg 

 (figs. 8, 10). At the posterior end of the cloaca each egg shows a 

 spermatozoon within the cell membrane, and the first polar spindle 

 at the periphery of the cell (fig. 8). At this stage the egg has two 

 membranes: the outer, thinner one staining with chromatin stains, 

 already mentioned, and a thicker inner one that stains faintly with 

 cytoplasmic stains (fig. 8) ; both are closely adherent to the cytoplasm. 

 But where the polar spindle touches the periphery these membranes 

 are not present. It is probable that both these, membranes are pro- 

 ducts of the cytoplasm, and not of any gland cells of the genital passages 

 (as I had previously opined), else one could not explain their absence 

 in the region of the polar spindle. The outer membrane has at its 

 inception probably a glutinous nature, serving to hold the eggs 

 together in a string. 



The eggs pass out of the cloaca in a cylindrical continuous string, 

 iLSually much convoluted, and in the first few daj's snowy white; the 

 worm may occupy as much as twenty-four hom-s in the discharge of 

 its egg-string, and then, ^\dth its body flaccid and flattened, it expires. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 743 



The first pole-body is cut off by the egg shortly after the expvilsion 

 from the body, and when it is cut off the two cell-membranes separate 

 it from the surface of the egg (fig. 9). Shortly afterward these two 

 membranes swell, probably by osmotic action of the surrounding water, 

 and together compose a double membrane removed from the surface 

 of the egg (fig. 10), while the cytoplasm has formed a third delicate 

 membrane which remains adherent to it. By this means the first polar 

 body becomes removed from the surface of the egg. The ovocyte of 

 the second order (fig. 10) shows the second polar spindle, like the first 

 in form, and without an intervening rest stage, and this also contains 

 seven chromosomes (fig. 11). The chromosomes are too minute to 

 allow a deterinination of which of these is the reduction division ; the 

 second polar body is then cut off (fig. 12), but remains adherent to the 

 egg, and the stage of the ovotid is reached. 



During the process of formation of the second polar body the sper- 

 matozoon is changing into the sperm nucleus (figs. 10, 12), in that its 

 head becomes a rounded chromatin mass lying within a clear vacuole. 

 Quite frequently there is polyspermy, but I have no evidence that such 

 cases develop into embrj^os. When the second polar body is cut off 

 we find the sperm nucleus in the form of a large spherical nucleus, with 

 a nucleolus and a linin network; and the egg nucleus in a less advanced 

 stage (fig. 13). Finally the two nuclei are seen, both in the rest stage 

 (fig. 14). It is remarkable, and to my knowledge unique in the known 

 cases of fertilization, that the two pronuclei are unequal in volume 

 in the rest stage (fig. 14), as also in the prophases of the first cleavage 

 (fig. 15); not a single case was found in which they were of equal 

 volume. The smaller one appears to be the egg nucleus, because in 

 most cases it is the one nearest the second polar body. Its smaller 

 size is probably due to the fact that it is formed in less time than the 

 sperm nucleus, and that the period is very short between its rest stage 

 and the formation of the first cleavage spindle. 



Fig. 15 shows the two pronuclei in the prophase of the first cleavage, 

 the sperm nucleus being the one at the left hand ; the nuclear membrane 

 of each has disappeared at the point where there is an accumulation 

 of finely structured cytoplasm, resembling the "archoplasm" of the 

 similar stage in Ascaris. Each pronucleus contains a linin network 

 and seven minute chromosomes; these are shown in the drawing much 

 less distinctly than in the preparation, where the chromosomes are 

 stained intensely blue and the linin very faintly. The first cleavage 

 spindle (fig. 16) contains 14 chromosomes (only 12 seen in this figure), 

 and the spindle, unlike the polar spindles, is pointed at each end; but 




744 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



neither at this stage nor at any of the later ones have I been able to 

 determine the presence of centrosomes. 



The double egg-membrane, which we saw had become separated 

 from the surface of the egg, is still present and continues to include 

 the embryo until the lar\'al stage ia a week old or more. It is a com- 

 plete protection for the egg against any bacterial organisms. 



In the matter of the cleavage I have spent much time in the en- 

 deavor to work out the cell-Uneage, but have been unable to do so. 

 The egg hi spherical ; the second polar body varies in its position with 

 regard to the axis of the first cleavage spindle; the yolk appears to 

 be rather uniformly distributed near the periphery. So there is no 

 means of orientation of the uncleaved egg. The cleavage is total and 

 adequal (figs. 17-21). The two blastomeres of the 2-ccIl stage are 

 almost equal in volume^ but one is always slightly larger than the 

 other (fig. 17). In the 4-€ell stage (fig. 18) there are two larger blasto- 

 meres and two smaller ones, but the difference is very slight. The axes 

 of the spindles in the 2-cell stage may be parallel or not, and the cells 

 may divide simultaneously or successively. In the 4-ceIl stage it is 

 meet frequent that a line connecting the two smaller blastomeres is 

 perpendicular to one joining the two larger, in such a way that all fom- 

 blastomeres do not lie in one plane; they apparently never arrange 

 themselves in the T-shape so characteristic of Ascaris. Then the 

 blastomeres are not spherical, but so moulded by mutual contact that 

 it is exceedingly difficult to determine their relati^-e volumes. Again, 

 the blastomeres of the 4-ceU stage may di^-ide simultaneously or not. 

 For these reasons I have fovmd it impossible to work out the cell- 

 Uneage, without, however, wishing to imply that it may not be per- 

 fectly determinate. 



A cceloblastula (fig. 20) is formed at an early cleavage, sometimes 

 as early as six blastomeres, almost always at the 8-cell stage (fig. 19), 

 At the 16-ceU stage (fig. 21) the cleavage-ca\-it\' is large. On optical 

 sections one pole of the blastula shows cells somewhat larger than 

 those of the opposite pole. 



While there are but a relatively small nmnber of blastomeres, an 

 invagination of the larger-celled wall of the blastula commences and 

 leads to the establishment of a typical invagination gastrula (figs. 22- 

 27). All the lining (mesentoderm) of the gastroccel is not formed by 

 an inpushing of the wall of the blastula, but it appears rather that only 

 a small number of cells are invaginated, and that by the cell diM'sion 

 of these the mesentoderm increases in amoimt. The orifice of the 

 invagination, the blastopore is verj' narrow, and in a position that 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 745 



corresponds with the ventro-posterior end of the larva ; and the end 

 toward which the mesentoderm turns (figs. 23, 24, 26) is anterior; so 

 we can now distinguish anterior and posterior, dorsal and ventral, right 

 and left. The invaginated layer of cells is a mesentoderm, because from 

 it comes both the mesenchym and the entoderm, as shown in figs. 25-27, 

 where the mesenchym cells are shaded. From that area where the 

 mesentoderm joins the ectoderm (the outer cell-layer) takes place a 

 proliferation of cells of the mesentoderm, leading to the formation of 

 loose cells and masses of cells, the mesenchjTn, lying within the cleavage- 

 cavity. Fig. 23 shows just at the blastopore two particularly large 

 blast omeres, which I first took to be mesenchym pole cells; but I 

 found them in only one case, and do not believe there is a proliferation 

 from a pair of pole cells, though the proliferation comes from the region 

 near the blastopore. In no case was there any e^'idence of formation 

 of the mesenchym from the side of the ectoderm; in these stages the 

 mitotic spindles of the ectoderm cells lie always parallel to their free 

 surface, never perpendicular to it, as would be necessarv for the forma- 

 tion of mesenchym. Particularly decisive in this matter are cases like 

 that shown in fig. 25 — mesentoderm cells dividing at right angles to 

 the surface of the mesentoderm. This embn-'onic tissue is properly 

 mesenchym and not mesoderm, since the cells do not arise as an epi- 

 thelium or in compact masses, but separately; and cases like that of 

 fig. 27, where they appear for a time to compose solid masses, are delu- 

 sive and due to the difficulty of distinguishing the cells. At no stage 

 up through the larva do these cellular elements become epithelia. 



The remainder of the early development may be traced rapidly, and 

 simply in order to clarify the organization of the larva. The blastopore 

 closes early {BL, figs. 24-29), or remains as a very narrow opening. 

 The entoderm grows fonvard and is largest at its apex (fig. 26) ; this 

 portion of the entodermal canal will become the gland of the larva 

 (figs. 28-30, GL). By cell division the few first-produced mesen- 

 chym cells form more numerous smaller elements within the 

 cleavage-ca\'ity, shown as the shaded cells in figs. 26-32. The 

 next notable change is that at a point nearly opposite the blasto- 

 pore {Bl.) the ectoderm thickens (fig. 28), becoming two to three 

 cell-layers deep, whereas elsewhere it has become much thinner; at 

 this stage also the anterior end of the entodermal canal is becoming 

 constricted off from the remainder. In the next stage the thickened 

 ectoderm mass commences to invaginatc (fig. 29), this being the co^u- 

 mcnccmcnt of the proboscis; at the inner surface (that surface border- 

 ing on the cleavage-cavity) this invaginated ectoderm shows an aiuiular

proliferation {Di., fig. 29), which is the perceptible beginning of the 

 diaphragm of the larva. Now also the anterior portion of the ento- 

 clermal canal is nearly cut off from the posterior, it is the immature 

 condition of the larval gland {Gl.) ; sometimes, as in fig. 29, its anterior 

 end is pointed and in contact with the ectoderm of the proboscis, and 

 probably this pointed end represents the beginning of the tube duct 

 of the gland; at least I have no further evidence as to the mode of 

 development of the duct. Fig. 30 shows the ectodermal invagination 

 further progressed, and the gland {Gl.) completely cut off from the 

 intestine {In.); the mesoderm cells are nmnerous. In the stage of 

 fig. 31 the embryo is bent upon itself, comma-shaped, since the growth 

 is not of volume but of length, and the double egg-membrane prevents 

 growth in a straight line. The embryo is bent in the region of the 

 diaphragm {Di.). The diaphragm and the whole proboscis anterior 

 to it is ectodermal, except for a few mesenchym cells (shaded) that 

 have now become young muscle cells. Behind the diaphragm, all 

 that region which may be termed the "trunk," we find entoderm com- 

 posing the embryonic intestine {In.) and gland {GL), mesenchym 

 (shaded), and a thin layer of ectoderm which, on the ventral surface 

 near the diaphragm, is thickened (embryonic nervous epithelium). 

 Fig. 32 is an immature larva with the armature of the proboscis 

 developed. 



During these stages the ectoderm of the surface of the body becomes 

 very thin, and its component cells fewer in number (compare figs. 27 

 and 31) ; this is evidently due to a participation of the whole ectodermic 

 layer in the proboscidial invagination. In the intestine also the nuclei 

 move to the two ends (compare figs. 29 and 32), so that elsewhere 

 the intestinal wall becomes very thin. The blastopore is completely 

 closed, but its position still marked by the angle of junction of the 

 ectoderm (hypodermis) and entoderm (intestine). The gland loses 

 its central lumen. 



2. The Larva (Plate L). . 



The larva is still included within the double egg-membrane, and is 

 not noticeably larger in volume than the egg-cell, so that during all 

 this time it can have taken no nourishment from without. 



A transverse diaphragm (fig. 26, Di.), the margins of which are 

 fused with the hypodermis {Hy.), separates the body into two regions 

 an lanterior proboscis and a posterior head-trunk. The diaphragm is 

 with difficulty demonstrable, somewhat thicker than the hypodermis, 

 and staining slightly with hsematoxyline ; on its anterior surface are 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 747 



a few nuclei, of which four central ones are notably conspicuous. 

 It is traversed only by the duct {Gl.d.) of the gland {GL). It is 

 owing to the presence of this diaphragm that movements of the 

 proboscis cause no movements whatever of the fluid within the cavity 

 (archicoel) of the head-trunk. 



The proboscis is seen in evaginated condition in fig. 36, in contracted 

 in fig. 37. The evagination is due to the contraction of longitudinal 

 muscles {Mus.) lying beneath the body w^all and reflected over the 

 axial stalk of the proboscis. A contraction of these muscles evaginates 

 the armature, partly perhaps by a direct pull, partly perhaps by pro- 

 ducing a pressure upon the fluid contained within the cavity of the 

 proboscis. A comparison of figs. 36 and 37 furnishes the best repre- 

 sentation of the mechanics of this process. When the armature is 

 evaginated the wall of the proboscis shows its annular folds very close 

 together (fig. 36); when retracted, further apart and less numerous. 

 What causes the retraction of the armature is difficult to decide, but 

 it is perhaps due to the tension of certain long cells {Fib.) lying at the 

 base of the axis. 



The hypodermis of the outer wall of the proboscis is exceeding!}^ 

 thin from the diaphragm to the base of the third row of spicules (5p. S) 

 of the armature, and contains not more than one or two nuclei. On its 

 outer surface is a thicker homogeneous cuticula which does not extend 

 over the armature region. Cuticula and hypodermis together compose 

 a very thin outer wall which is thrown into folds, so that the larva 

 appears to be superficially annulated. As well as I could determine 

 these folds are temporary, and their number changes with movements 

 of the proboscis, though the annulations are always present. There 

 are no circular muscles to produce them. The hypodermis is thickened 

 below the spicules and stilets which compose the armature, and shows 

 one nucleus at the base of each stilet and each spicule ; at the base of 

 the stilets {St., figs. 36, 37) the hypodermis becomes continuous with 

 the axial ectodermic cell mass. 



The armature, best studied in life or on individuals treated with 

 caustic potash, shows three rows of spicules and three stilets (figs. 

 33-37). The first row of spicules {Sp. 1) is composed of a circle of 

 six spicules, namely, a pair of dorso-lateral and a pair of dorso-ventral 

 spicules, and a pair of lateral ones considerably larger than the others. 

 The second row {Sp. 2) is made up of a circle of four spicules, a dorso- 

 lateral and a ventro-lateral pair lying Ijcneath the corresponding pairs 

 of the first row; these are the smallest of all the spicules. The spicules 

 of both of these rows arc flattened, pointed cuticular plates, wiXh 




748 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



Slightly thickened margins. The third row of spicules (Sp. 3) is com- 

 posed of a circle of needle-like spines, seven in number: one dorsal, 

 one pair of dorso-lateral, one pair of dorso- ventral, and one pair of 

 closely approximated ventral spicules. All these spicules project 

 backward when the armatm^e is evaginated. The three stilets point 

 forward; one of them is ventral {St.v., figs. 33-35), and the others 

 dorso-lateral (St.d.). Each is a slender rod, with the proximal end 

 widened, but with a depression on each side of the expansion (there 

 shaped like a human red blood corpuscle) ; and with the distal end also 

 expanded and bearing on its median surface a series of fine parallel 

 ridges. The stilets surround a delicate canal, at the base of which 

 opens the duct of the gland (Gl.d.). The whole armature is an exqui- 

 site device for the penetration of the tissues of the host, and for moving 

 through them — the stilets penetrating, the spicules by their gripping 

 pulling the larva forward. One does not know which to admire more, 

 the perfection of the larva for occasioning torture or the beneficence 

 of the Providence allowing such torment. 



The axis of the proboscis is separated from the outer wall by a space, 

 archico?!, and is composed of a cord of cells extending from the base of 

 the stilets to the diaphragm (figs. 36, 37). That part of this cord 

 nearest the stilets passes over continuously into the hypodermis, and 

 is composed of a mass of cells without perceptible boundaries, contain- 

 ing a number of large nuclei. So far as I can determine these are sim- 

 ply undifferentiated cctodermic cells. The other end of the cord is 

 made up of a number of long spindle-shaped cells (Fib.), attached at 

 one end to the diaphragm ; these may serve as elastic retractors of the 

 evaginated armature. 



The musculature of the proboscis is composed exclusively of longi- 

 tudinal fibres {Mus. of figs. 36 and 37), the only faintly shaded struc- 

 tures in these drawings of the proboscis. These muscle cells are too 

 minute for any determination of their finer structure ; one can simply 

 determine their long spindle shapes, the presence of nuclei in them, and 

 the fact that they do not form a continuous layer, but are separated 

 from one another though parallel. Their arrangement is shown in figs. 

 36 and 37. 



All this region anterior to the diaphragm has been called by me the 

 proboscis, because evidently the whole is simply an organ for penetra- 

 tion and locomotion in the host, even though it composes about one- 

 half of the body. There is no entoderm in its constitution (except 

 the duct of the gland body situated behind the diaphragm), and mesen- 

 chvm onlv in the form of the musculature ; all the remainder is ectoder- 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF nULADELPHlA. 749 



mic. It has no intestine, and no nervous system, unless, indeed, the 

 large cells of the axis may be considered embryonic nerve cells, or some 

 of the cells on the anterior surface of the diaphragm. It is not com- 

 parable with a head, nor is it to be regarded as a segment of equal 

 morphological value with the head-trunk. The proof is yet wanting, 

 but it will probably be found that this proboscis is the essential larval 

 organ, disappearing more or less completely before the adult condition. 

 and that the head-trunk is the persisting i-egion. 



The posterior head-trunk (fig. 36) is bent upon the proboscis, as the 

 larva lies within the egg-membranes, but by the action of the longi- 

 tudinal muscles the whole body may be straightened. Its hypodermis 

 and cuticula is of the same structure as that of the posterior portion 

 of the proboscis, except for the presence of two pairs of cuticular 

 hooks (JY.). placed right and left on each side of the posterior end, 

 and for the presence of a thickening of the h>-podermis. This thicken- 

 ing (Nv.) lies ventral just behind the diaphragm, and shows a double 

 row of large nuclei, one row to the right and the other to the left of the 

 median line, and each row with foiu- to five nuclei. This thickening 

 is to be regarded as the nervous system of the larva. It is an ectoder- 

 mal thickening of definite form in everj- larva; and its ventral position 

 corresponds with the position of the nerve cord of the adult. There 

 are no other parts of the larva which can be considered nervous, unless 

 the large h}-podermal cells composing the axis of the proboscis have 

 that function — against which assumption a number of objections 

 might be urged. This thickening is then a double row of neuroblasts, 

 recognizable only on carefully stained preparations ; nerve fibres cannot 

 be determined. 



The longitudinal muscle-cells (Mus.) lie just beneath the hA-podermis, 

 and terminate anteriorh- against the diaphragm. The)- have the same 

 appearance as those of the proboscis, but are more difficult to perceive, 

 particularly those of the doi-sal side. Here also there is no trace of 

 circular muscles. 



In the archicoel, at the anterior end of the head-trunk, is placed a 

 large gland (Gl.), which, as we have seen, arose as an abstriction from 

 the entodermal canal. By a long duct (fig. 36, Gl.d.) it is connected 

 with the exterior at the base of the stilets (St.) of the proboscis. This 

 gland lies free within the archiccel, and contains about eight large 

 nuclei; cell boundaries are barely distinguishable, and the cytoplasm 

 is dense and stains uniformly. The long, convoluted duct can usually 

 be found only in life, when it appears as a perfectly clear, convoluted 

 line. On a few preparations, however, its portion within the gland 




750 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



body was deeply stained by hsematoxyline. It arises near the pos- 

 terior end of the gland body, extends through the length of the latter, 

 then piercing the diaphragm extends forward through the archiccel 

 of the proboscis, i.e., on the surface of the axial stalk. Whether this 

 extremely delicate canal is intercellular or intracellular in the gland 

 body, I could not ascertain ; if it were intercellular it would represent 

 a portion of the gastroccelic cavity. As to the function of this gland, 

 the position of its external aperture at the base of the stilets would 

 point to its being a poison gland. There is no good reason for judging 

 it to be an excretory organ; and indeed we shall see that what are 

 probably excretory masses become stored up within the cavity of the 

 intestine. 



The intestine {In., fig. 36) of the larva is a closed tube, terminating 

 blindly at its anterior end, and at its posterior connecting with the 

 cuticula of the body wall without external opening; this latter point 

 corresponds with the blastopore {BL). This posterior end of the in- 

 testine appears as a narrow, solid stalk, with two or four nuclei apposed 

 to its surface. The wall of the remainder of the intestine is very thin, 

 except at the opposite ends where it is thickened and embraces several 

 large nuclei. Within the intestinal lumen are always present usually 

 two, sometimes more, largo globules {Glo.) of a pale brownish color 

 and viscid consistency. These appear first when the larva is not quite 

 mature as a thinner fluid, but subsequently accumulate as homo- 

 geneous, rounded globules. These cannot represent food substance, 

 for the blastopore is closed and the intestine has no connection with 

 the exterior. It is then probable they represent products of metabolic 

 waste, in which case the intestine of the larva would serve as an excre- 

 tory reservoir. 



Within the archiccel, just at the posterior end of the head-trunlc, is a 

 mass of a few small cells {Mus.), evidently mesenchym cells that have 

 not become specialized; they are embryonic, and may be germ cells. 



Finally, the body-cavity of the larva is an archiccel, without floating 

 cells and apparently without connective tissue. There are no meso- 

 dermal epithelia (mesothelia) ; and the only transverse septum of 

 the body, the diaphragm, is ectodermic. 



3. Previous Work. 



I have not seen the papers of Grube (1849) and Meissner (1856), nor 

 yet the last paper on the early development, one in Russian by Tretia- 

 ivow (1901). 



Leidy (1850, 1870) gives a very superficial account, with no figures, 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 751 



of the formation of the larva; he noted the proboscis invagination, 

 and the spicules ("filaments") of the armature. 



Villot (1874) was the first to give an extended account of the develop- 

 ment of the larva. He described the formation of the egg-string 

 ("nid amentum"), and the appearance of the egg-envelopes; and 

 "describes the polar bodies as being very variable in number, form and 

 volume. He found the segmentation to be total and equal and leads 

 to a "germe" formed of two concentric spheres (the process of which 

 was not determined), ectoderm and entoderm respectively. He noted 

 the ectodermal invagination at the anterior end of the embryo and in- 

 terpreted it to be the beginning of the "head" (equivalent to my term 

 "proboscis"). His fig. 49 is the most detailed sketch yet given of the 

 structure of the larva. The whole armature of the proboscis is de- 

 scribed very accurately. But he describes an anterior mouth com- 

 municating by an cesophaguo with a posterior intestine, and the latter 

 by an open anus with the exterior — failing to see the diaphragm, and 

 mistaking for an oesophagus the solid axial cord of the proboscis. He 

 saw correctly the gland and its duct, but interpreted it as an excretory 

 organ. The musculature is noted, and the body-cavity described as 

 filled with cells. His second paper (1891) is mainly a criticism of the 

 work of Camerano. 



Camerano (1889) studied the development not quite to the point 

 of the larval stage, figures the chromosomes and certain details in the 

 formation of the polar bodies, which he finds to be two in number. 

 The earliest penetration of the spermatozoon he did not see, but 

 describes a succession of stages of the two pronuclei, and figures them 

 as of unequal size. The early cleavage he finds to be quite variable in 

 different eggs, though holoblastic. In regard to the process of gastru- 

 lation his results are entirely different from mine. He finds the embryo 

 at the end of the cleavage to be a flattened plate, not a sphere, a disk 

 composed of two layers of cells — a sterroblastula. This plate becomes 

 quadrangular instead of circular in outline ; then an invagination takes 

 place at one end of the plate, which he interprets as a prostoma, and 

 concludes the sterroblastula to have become a coelogastrula. I can 

 only interpret Camerano's results as follows: First, that the strong 

 fixatives employed produced flattening of the embryos, which I have 

 frequently observed after fixation with acetic acid or strong alcohol; 

 second, that he did not see the gastrula invagination at all (which 

 would take place at the stage of his figs. 43 to 45), and mistook the 

 ectodermal proboscidial invagination for the gastrula cavity. 



Villot was in error in describing the true larva as the "etat embry- 




752 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



onnaire" or "premiere forme larvaire," and the immature worm found 

 as a parasite in insects the "etat larvaire proprement dit" or "deux- 

 ieme forme larvaire." Camerano and Vejdovsky (1894) are quite 

 right in insisting, in opposition to Villot and von Linstow, that the 

 organism as it leaves the egg-membranes is the larva, and that there 

 is no second larval stage. That stage is the larva which is equipped ' 

 ■^•ith a temporary larval organ, the proboscis ; all later stages, as far as 

 they are known, are but progressions toward the adult condition. 



4. Conclusions. 



The opinion I had previously expressed (1903) from a study of the 

 adult anatomy of Paragordius was as follows: "With the Nematoda 

 the Gordiacea have in common only one important structwe, the 

 tubular genitaha and their opening into the cloaca. With the Annelida 

 they agree in the structure and innervation of the musculature, and 

 in having dorso-ventral mesenteries which divide body-cavities 

 bounded by cell-layers. But there is good reason for doubting the 

 homologies of these mesenteries and body-cavities in these two groups 

 of animals. They differ from the Annelida in showing no trace at all 

 of true metamerism (either in the nervous system, the body-cavities, 

 the genitalia or the body wall) ; in the absence of a cerebral ganglion, 

 of a vascular system, of setal sacks or extremities ; and very markedly 

 in the structure of the genitalia. In ^dew of these facts the Gordiacea 

 cannot be regarded as even highly degenerate Annelida, as Vejdo^•sky 

 has done, nor yet as modified Nematoda, the view of most of the 

 writers, but must rather be considered a group of isolated position, 

 as Grenacher, von Siebold and Villot have regarded them." 



The present study of the early development confirms this view, but 

 shows that there is considerable correspondence of the cleavage and 

 gastrulation processes with those of the Nematoda. The middle germ- 

 layer is not a connected mesoderm, but a mesenchym of disconnected 

 cells, arising from the mesentoderm close to the blastopore. 



The larva has two marked peculiarities. First, by a transverse 

 septum, the diaphragm, the body is partitioned into an anterior 

 proboscis and a posterior head-trunk. This proboscis is entirely ecto- 

 dermal except for mesenchymatous muscles, and lacks any nervous 

 system, excretory system, and any portion of an intestine. Though 

 it composes half the body, it is probably a purely larval organ that 

 takes no part in the adult structure; the diaphragm marks the future 

 boundary of the adult head, and the proboscis is precephahc. A sup- 

 port for this ^^ew, apart from good anatomical considerations, is to 




190-1-] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 753 



be found in the work of Vejdovsky (1894), ])articiilarly his fig. 17; this 

 represents an outUne of the head of an immature individual, showing 

 at the tip of the definitive head the still persisting proboscis with a 

 transverse septum. The future head and trunk proper then lie behind 

 the proboscis of the larva, and this head-trunk becomes the complete 

 body of the adult; this we can say certainl}^, even though the early 

 post-larval development is entirely unknown. 



This head-trunk has a wall like the proboscis, a h^^podermis with 

 cuticula, and longitudinal mcsenchymatous muscle fibres. There is 

 no coelom. no peritoneum or mesenteries. The nervous system is 

 simply a ventral thickening of the hypodermis. In the head-trunk 

 is found the second striking pocviliarity of the Paragordius larva — a 

 gland connecting by a long duct with the anterior end of the proboscis. 

 This gland is entodermal, arising as an abstriction from the anterior 

 end of the entodermal tube. In point of origin it resembles an entero- 

 coel, a mesoderm sack, and its early lumen is a portion of the gastroccel. 

 But there the resemblance ceases, for it becomes a gland, evidently 

 secretory and not excretory, which later develops a duct to the exterior. 

 Its origin is unpaired. The only forms which show a similar unpaired 

 cnteroccel arising from the anterior end of the entoderm tube are the 

 Holothurians, and there an outgrowth of a portion (hydrocoel) of the 

 hydro-enterocoel connects it, in the form of the stone canal, with the 

 exterior. But it would be a rash comparison, in no way justified, 

 between a Gordiacean and a Holothurian. This gland probably 

 continues to a late stage of the development under the form of the 

 "braune Driise" of Gordius, described by Vejdovsky, but is not 

 homologous with the problematical ''supraintestinal organ" that I 

 found in the adult of Paragordius. 



When we consider this ectodermal proboscis, the cctodermic dia- 

 phragm and the enteroccelic gland; the absence of any coelomic 

 cavities, ciliary wreaths and excretory organs; the lack of a mouth 

 and the mesenchymatous musculature, we must conclude this union of 

 characters to make the Gordiacean larva unique, not closely comparable 

 with any other larva. 



If my interpretation of the larva is correct, then the early post-larval 

 development, which has yet to be studied, should show the mouth 

 arising in the plane of the diaphragm, probably as an ectodermic 

 stomodffium; the dorsal commissure of the brain developing in the 

 same region; and the reproductive organs arising from the small 

 mass of mesenchym cells at the posterior end. But the point of most 

 importance that remains to be investigated is the first origin of that 




7.54 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



tissue so peculiar to the Gordiacea, the "parenchj-m," and its arrange- 

 ment into layers. Not until that is done can the structure of the adult 

 be adequately interpreted.

NEW, RARE OR LITTLE KNOWN SCOMBROIDS. No. L 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



The present paper is one of a series now in preparation, which will 

 be intended to give accounts of the more interesting Scombroids con- 

 tained in the collection of the The Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia. While a few of the species appear to be new, others are 

 rare, and some are of value in establishing identifications of older 

 naturalists. I have framed complete descriptions of some species 

 which have at all times needed elucidation, while a number of others 

 are supplemented with notes. Changes in nomenclature which appear 

 necessary are given. In such cases some are due entirely to a rigid 

 adherence to the original orthography. In the introduction of several 

 new subgenera it may be remembered that where transitional forms 

 occur, like those in the older conception of Caranx, the better defined 

 groups, possibly of different lines of descent, had at least best be 

 indicated even if only provisionally.

 slightly convex above and below. Snout long, conic, sides becoming 

 compressed, and top of head flattened anteriorly. Eye high, nearly 

 touching upper profile, and a little anterior. Mouth moderate, its 

 gape reaching about half way in space between tip of snout and front 

 rim of pupil. Preorbital long, of about e^-en width, and groov^ 

 extending about opposite middle of eye. Maxillary when exposed 

 reaching front rim of orbit, but when mouth is closed reaching front

 leaving a large flap at lower corner, and extending forward till nearly 

 opposite posterior nostril. Shoulder girdle furnished with two broad 

 fleshy processes with a rather broad space between. Isthmus long and 

 thin, but without a sharp edge. Rakers 13 + 23, long, though a little 

 shorter than longest filaments, or about equal to space between tip 

 of snout and posterior nostril. Rakers compressed, rather attenuate,

Color when fresh in arrack, blue-black above, with many round deep 

 or darker spots than body-color, and area above well separated from 

 lower surface of bodj'" by a sharp line of demarcation which reaches 

 lateral line below first finlets. Sides of head, trunk, and caudal pedun- 

 cle, together vAih. all of lower surface of body, silvery- white. Dorsal,

 I found a small Leiognathus ly\ inches in length. It was taken from 

 the gullet. 



I provisionally adopt the name Scomber kanagurta, though derived 

 from Russell's Indian fish^ and based on that of the Red Sea by Riippell, 

 who subsequently described S. chrysozonus^ and S. microlepidotus^ 

 from the same place. Kner recorded the latter from the Nicobars 

 and Hong Kong,* and Bleeker from Pinang.* Dr. Steindachner con- 

 siders both identical with S. loo,^ and Day^ united all three with 

 S. kanagurta, S. moluccensis,^ and S. reani,^ though Dr. Klunzinger 

 separated S. microlepidotus, retaining S. kanagurta and S. chnjsozonus 

 as distinct. 



Dr. Meek records microlepidotus from Aden.^° One of his examples 

 now in the Museum of Stanford University I have examined. It has 

 exceedingly long gill-rakers, the longest almost equal to snout and one-

 der girdle inside gill-opening nearly smooth and with obsolete pro- 

 cesses. Later Dr. Meek kindty examined the other examples, which 

 are at present in the Field Columbian Museum, and informs me that 

 the gill-rakers are long, and numerous, longest reacliing from tip of 

 snout to middle of pupil, 2^ to 2|- in head.

On comparison with a single cxamjjle from Newport (Rhode Island) 

 collected by Samuel Powel, and agreeing with Goode's figure,^^ this 

 difference is still carried out. However, the Newport example is only 

 about 12^ inches long, and thus it may be accounted for by age. 

 Goode's figure does not show the keel above the base of the pectoral 

 fin and parallel with the upper margin of the same fin. It is more 

 distinct and extends further posteriorly in my Italian example. 



I retain Rafinesque's name provisionally until more material is 

 compared, as it is possible that the East Indian form'^ may be difTcrent.

Two examples from the island of St. Thomas, West Indies. They 

 agree, and both difTer from the following example in the smaller 

 head, which is at least 3§ in its own length and that of the trunk.

I provisionally retain this as a distinct form from that of the Atlantic. 

 Cantor's fish may be identical, though East Indian and Micronesian 

 examples need comparison. The single example from Honolulu, now 

 before me, has a larger head than the West Indian examples, being 

 contained less than 3^ or about 3| in the length of head and trunk. 

 Dr. Giinther's figure^^ of an example from the Seychelles shows the 

 pectoral high in position, its origin level with the upper margin of the 

 eye, a character which I have not observed as yet in any examples of 

 Pelamys.

Some Practical Color Tests. — Dr. Henry Emerson Wetherill 

 explained a series of charts illustrating practical color tests as applicable 

 primarily to man, although the charts can be used for work in other 

 fields. 



An ante-mortem blood-color scale represents the amount of Oxy- 

 haemoglobin -^ith 100 per cent, as normal. It is made circular to facili- 

 tate its use. There are perforations between the adjacent colors so 

 that they may be the better matched. A similar series of colors repre- 

 sents the blood twenty-four hours after death. 



The relative humidity of the air is illustrated by a moisture scale, 

 which can also be used to measure the amount of cutaneous excretion. 



The colors of the m-ine are represented by two charts, and a scale for 

 the colors of the feces enables one to report numerically the conditions 

 as found. 



An improvement of the Dimethylamidoazobenzol test for HCL 

 was shown, and remarks made on its application. 



These scales serve as standards of comparison. A classification was

THEJ ORTHOPTERA OF THOMAS COUNTY. GEORGIA, AND LEON COUNTY, 

 FLORIDA. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



The material on which the following study is based comprised over 

 three thousand specimens, of ninety-four species. The majority of 

 this extensive series is contained in the collection of the junior author, 

 but a thoroughly representative series is in the collection of the Acad- 

 emy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, part being collected by Rehn 

 and part presented by Hebard. 



The series studied contains material taken on dates extending from 

 December, 1902, to April, 1904. The junior author resided at Thomas- 

 ville from December, 1902, to May, 1903, and from late November, 

 1903, to early April, 1904. During the summer of 1903 a collector 

 was employed to work in the vicinity of Thomas ville, and a very good 

 series of the summer and early autumn species obtained. The senior 

 author spent from March 14 to April 5, 1904, with Mr. Hebard and 

 they together examined considerable of the surrounding country. 

 Several trips were made over the State line into Leon county, the 

 adjoining portion of Florida, one in 1903 and two in 1904. 



The critical portion of the following paper is almost entirely the work 

 of the senior author, while the field notes, which are followed by M. H., 

 are the work of the junior author, but they agree in all the state- 

 ments made. 



As a general description of the country is usually of great value in 

 a faunistic paper, we have summarized the principal features of the 

 region under consideration and also made some notes on the occurrence, 

 time of abundance and local environment of a number of the more 

 interesting species of Orthoptera. 



Thomasville, Georgia, the county seat of Thomas county, is situated 

 in the southwestern part of the State, some twelve miles distant from 

 the Florida line and about fifty miles from Alabama. The surrounding 

 country is gently rolling and covered with fine pine forests, and divided 

 into large plantations, many of which have the greater part of their 

 area cleared and under cultivation, the chief crops being corn and 

 cotton. Sweet potatoes, sugar cane and peanuts are also extensively 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 775 



produced. The pine forests are usually wholly composed of the long- 

 leaf variety, but here and there a forest of nothing but the short-leaf 

 pine is to be found. In the pine woods there are hardly any other trees 

 excepting occasional oaks, sweet gums and dogwoods. These woods are 

 very open and there being hardly any undergrowth, a wagon may be 

 driven through them almost an}n\'here. The ground is in nearly all 

 places thickly carpeted with wire-grass and other small plants, with 

 here and there a dense clump of gall-berry bushes, while everywhere 

 the long pine needles are thickly scattered. Throughout these woods 

 the yellow jasmine grows in great luxuriance and when in flower is 

 most beautiful. In each depression of the land a stream is to be 

 found, called in this country a "branch." These streams are almost 

 invariably filled with a thick growth of magnolias, bay, black gum, 

 tulip, beech and other trees, while the undergrowth of blackberry, 

 grape and other vines is usually very dense, and an occasional thicket 

 of pipe cane adds to the difficulty of following the course of one of 

 these streams. To this must be added the fact that in many places 

 the ground on both sides of the "branch" is boggy and there are 

 muddy holes covered by sphagnum between the roots of the trees. 

 There are a few places where the pine forests have been cut down and 

 the land left uncultivated; in these situations has sprung up a dense 

 growth of scrub oak, which has completely choked out almost all other 

 vegetation. In other unreclaimed fields the short-leaf pine thrives, 

 and less frequently one finds a heavy growth of young long-leaf pines. 



The Ocklockonee river flows within five miles of the town, and is a 

 stream about thirty feet in width during the dry part of the year, but 

 during the heavy rains it spreads for a mile or more over the nearby 

 country, which is in most places low and swampy. 



Along portions of the river bank are dense swamps of gum, cypress 

 and other trees. Through these swamps run numerous ridges of clay 

 and sand with here and there shallow lagoons, which with the great 

 height of the trees and the numbers of fallow and mouldering logs 

 lend to these bottoms a very wild aspect. These places are the only 

 situations in this part of the country where deer, wildcats and an occa- 

 sional bear may be found. The character of the country just across 

 the line in Leon county, Florida, differs noticeably from that about 

 Thomasville. It is more rolling, with small lakes in every depression. 

 This country is unhealthy, for in the summer these lakes dry up expos- 

 ing to the sun a great amount of decayed vegetable matter. The 

 largest lakes near Thomasville are lamonia and Miccosukee. They arc 

 distant from the town about fifteen and eighteen miles respectively. 




776 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC.^ 



The former, although some miles long, occasionally goes dry in a>ery 

 short space of time, and fills up again with as great rapidity. The 

 water has been found to flow in and out through a subterranean pas- 

 sage, and once, when the lake went dry, a peculiarly marine fish was 

 taken from the opening through which the water had receded. This 

 opening was filled with a great number of fish, although they had been 

 left dead by the thousand on the bed of the lake when the water dis- 

 appeared. 



The soil of this region is rich, but not deep, the red clay, which is 

 everywhere, often being within a few inches of the surface of the high 

 ground where, however, the crops seem to grow as well as anywhere. 



The Orthoptera of the country around Thomasville is best repre- 

 sented in the pine woods. Here among the wire-grass and pine needles 

 which carpet the ground many interesting species are to be found. 

 In early December, before the frosts have thinned their numbers, 

 Amblytropidia occidentalis, Aptenopedes sphenarioides and Radinotatum 

 brevipenne are most abundant through these forests; Schistocerca 

 damnifica, Melanoplus keeleri, M. nigrescens and M. scudderi are then 

 by no means common but more restricted to colonies. Among the 

 really scarce species are Melanoplus sylvestris and Gymnoscirtetes 

 pusillus. By December Orphulella pratorum, which swarms in the 

 open spots of the woods in the fall, becomes quite scarce, as is the case 

 with Arphia xanthoptera, and to a considerable extent that of Dicty- 

 ophorus guttatus. By the end of December almost all Orthoptera dis- 

 appears owing to the cold weather, and diu-ing the following two months 

 the conditions usually remain the same. In March, at the advent of 

 warm weather, Amblytropidia occidentalis and Aptenopedes sphena- 

 rioides are again very plentiful and Schistocerca americana appears 

 common in certain localities, while *S'. damnifica and Arphia sulphurea 

 are generally noticed. The Forficulidce is represented by several 

 species, only one of which. Labia burgessii, is abundant. Infrequently 

 Labia minor and Anisolabis annulipes are found, and occasional small 

 colonies of Labia guttata and Spongophora brunneipennis located. 

 These colonies are usually found in dead magnolias or other hardwood 

 trees, but occasional specimens may be taken from bark on pine logs. 

 The BlattidcB is represented by Ceratinoptera luiea, which is sometimes 

 very common among the dead leaves under oaks, sweet gums and 

 hickories. In the pine logs between December and March many imma- 

 ture Ischnoptera may be taken by peeling off the loose bark ; mature 

 individuals begin to appear about the middle of April, and by May 

 most specimens are fully developed. The most plentiful species of 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 777 



Maniidce is StagmomatUis Carolina and its favorite habitat is a black- 

 berry bush or other low growth, occasionally in the pine woods, but 

 more often in branches and fields. The slender Thesprotia gramini^ 

 is a purely pine woods species, and is found among the wire-grass, 

 where it is so well protected by both form and coloration as to almost 

 defy detection. In the spring Coiwccphalus appears in numbers in the 

 broom sedge and other grasses throughout the pine woods. The 

 GryUidce in the fall before the frosts is represented by a few species, 

 of which Xemohius amhitiosus is most plentiful, and it may be found 

 in diminished numbers throughout the winter. Under rubbish Gryllus 

 are common, and Orochari^ gryllodes may be found hibernating under 

 signs on oak trees. During the spring, in certain restricted localities, 

 Falcicula hcbardi is quite plentiful among the wire-grass, and later in 

 the summer Hapithit^ brevipennis, while (Ecanihus appears frequenting 

 the bushes and shrubs, especially those growing on the sides of the 

 branches. The Orthoptera found in these branches differs greatly 

 from that of the pine woods. Here in the late fall hardly anything is 

 to be found except Nemobiiis caroliniis and exiguus which are plenti- 

 ful, the former in beds of sphagnum only; and some Paroxya floridiana 

 restricted to a few sunny spots. In the spring, however, Tettigidea 

 lateralis is very common in all grassy spots, and in certain localities 

 Tettigidea spicata is found. In other locations Acrydium arenosum, 

 Parateitix texanus and Neotcttix fcnwraius may be taken, the best 

 places being where these streams empty into a lake or flow through 

 low sandy stretches of fields. The species of Acrididce found in the 

 fields just before the hea%y frosts are Chortopliaga viridifasciata, 

 Melanophis propiiiquus and Orphulella pratorum, all in great numbers; 

 Psinidia fenestrali^, Mdanoplus atlanis and Spharagemon wyomingi- 

 anum are moderately common earlier but soon disappear, while Dichro- 

 morpha viridi^, which swarms in the summer, is not in evidence. 

 Among the species found during the summer months are Hippiscus 

 phcenicoptenis, H. rwjosiis, Spharagemon bolli, Dissosteira Carolina and 

 Trimerotropis citrina. 



Tamily FORFICULID^. 

 Labidara bidens (Olivier). 



This species is apparently not uncommon at Thomasville, as speci- 

 mens were taken May 2, 21, 26 and 29; August 12, and a series of eight 

 the first w.'ck in October, 1903. These individuals are indistinguish- 

 able from Cuban spccuneas, and exhibit coasiderablo variation in 

 size, but in color are quite coastant.

These specimens were taken in hot weather only and were attracted 

 to the arc hghts. (M. H.) 



Anisolabis annulipes (H. Lucas). 



Specimens of this species taken at Thomas\dlle, December 24, 1902 

 (under pine bark), August 20, September 9, December 9, 1903 (in 

 house), and March 23, 1904, are the first individuals recorded from the 

 United States. In one individual (December 9) the maculations on 

 the limbs are rather weak. 



The few specimens of this species taken were all met wdth accident- 

 ally. It appeared to be at all times very scarce. (M. H.) 

 Spongophora brunneipennis (Sen'ille). 



A number of specimens (ten) of this species were taken at Thomas- 

 ville under magnolia bark, December 10, 11 and 13, 1903. They are 

 equally divided between the sexes and are constant in size and colora- 

 tion. An immature specimen was also taken under pine bark in Leon 

 county, Florida, on April 7, 1903. 



All the specimens of this species were taken from under the bark of a 

 dead magnolia tree. They were found in colonies of three or four 

 huddled closely together, and upon the bark which concealed them 

 being pried off they made vigorous attempts to escape. The speci- 

 mens of this species taken, with hardly an exception, were under 

 bark five or more feet from the ground, where the decayed wood was 

 dry and pithy and no't as far gone as that at the foot of the tree. 

 (M. H.) 



Labia minor (LinnEeus). 



A specimen of this species from Thomasville, but without further 

 data, was examined. 



Labia guttata Scudder. 



Three female specimens of this species have been examined from 

 Thomasville, one taken January 1, 1903, another January 24, 1903, 

 and the other in Georgia pine woods on ]\Iarch 1, 1904, 



A scarce species in this locaHty, taken from under the bark of dead 

 pine logs. In 1904 but one colony, consisting of four or five specimens, 

 was discovered, although dimng the year many logs were thoroughly 

 examined, (M, H.) 

 Labia burgessii Scudder. 



This species is quite common at Thomasville under the bark of dead 

 trees. A series of over a hundred and fifty specimens, representing 

 the adult condition of both sexes and immatm'e forms, has been exam- 

 ined. This series plainly demonstrates that there is considerable 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 779 



variation in the size of the adults of both sexes, but coloration appears 

 to be quite uniform, such difference as is apparent being due to the 

 extension of the abdomen, which causes the insect to appear more of a 

 chestnut color than is the case when in normal position. The speci- 

 mens were all taken in the months of December and March. 



This species is seldom to be met with, but when found is almost in- 

 variably in very large numbers. In 1903 a few specimens were taken 

 in the woods about Thomasville, and one colony of over forty specimens 

 was discovered in Leon County in a dead pine log under the loose 

 bark. In 1904 but one colony was observed; this was in the trunk 

 of a large magnoha which, though long dead, was still standing. The 

 specimens were all taken from the trunk less than five feet above the 

 ground where the wood was soft, damp and pulpy and the bark loose. 

 By visiting this tree several times and picking off all the loose bark and 

 soft wood over one hundred and fifty specimens were obtained, the 

 specimens usually found singly. This was the same tree on which 

 Spongophora hrunneipennis was found. Quite a number of immature 

 specimens of S. hrunneipennis were taken among individuals of this 

 species. (M. H.) 



Family BLATTID^. 



Ischnoptera inaequalis Saussure and Zehntner. 



Immature specimens of what appears to be this species were taken 

 at Thomasville, on March 23 and April 9, 1904. The individuals taken 

 on the latter date were from Linton's Pond, a body of water several 

 miles southeast of Thomasville. All were on oak. A single adult 

 male was taken at Thomasville, on May 6, 1903, and this appears to 

 be unquestionably incequalis. Blatchley has recently recorded this 

 species from Indiana, and with the original localities — North Mexico 

 and Texas — and Costa Rica, we have some idea of the distribution of 

 the species. The immature Thomasville specimens arc in such condi- 

 tion that the identification is attended by a little uncertainty, but no 

 other known North American species agrees with them as fully as 

 incequalis. 



All the immature specimens taken were found under advertising 

 signs on white oak trees only, and were extremely rapid in their move- 

 ments. (M. H.) 

 Isohnoptera johnsoni Rehn. 



This species is represented in the Thomasville collections examined 

 by an adult male taken July 23, 1903, and a series o!" immature indi- 

 viduals taken December 1, 1903, March 1, 23 and 25, and April 9, 

 1904. The immature specimens were all taken under sign? on trees 




780 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



or under bark. Naturally some little uncertainty is attached to the 

 identification of the specimens, but they can safely be considered 

 johnsoni. Some individuals possess light narrow lateral margins to 

 the pronotum, mesonotum and metanotum. 



All the immature specimens taken were found under sigas on oak 

 trees in company with immature individuals of other species of Isch- 

 noptera. \Mien revealed the majority in their hurry fell from the tree 

 and hid in the leaves at its foot, but a few, relying in their protective 

 coloration, would press themselves closely to the bark and remain 

 motionless. (M. H.) 

 Ischnoptera nhleriana Saussure. 



Adult Thomasville specimens of this species taken ]\Iarch 23, April 6, 

 May, July 10 and 25, 1903, have been examined. They fully agree 

 with specimens from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Data with 

 some specimens informs us they were taken from under pine bark. 



This is the most abundant roach found in this region imder the bark 

 of dead pine logs. It was hardlv ever met with except on pine. 

 (M. H.) 



Ischnoptera major (Saussure and Zehntner). 



A large series of immature individuals, some nearl}' adult, we refer 

 to this species. The larger specimens are undoubtedly major, but the 

 smaller ones may represent other species as well. The localities 

 represented are Thomasville, T}i;y Plantation and the Ocklockonee 

 river, and the dates range from February to October. 



Almost all the immature specimens taken of this species were from 

 under the bark of dead pine logs. (M. H.) 



Ceratinoptera lutea Saussure and Zehntner. 



Several immature specimens of this species were taken at Thomas- 

 ville on December 31, 1902. 



This species is occasionally very abundant in dead oak leaves. 

 Many immature specimens were also seen under signs on trees, espe- 

 cially on sweet gum, in company with immature specimens of Isch- 

 noptera. fM. H.) 

 Periplaneta americana (Linnseus). 



This omnipresent species is represented in the collections by a num- 

 ber of Thoma3\'ille specimens taken in April, June and December. 

 Periplaneta truncata Krauss. 



This species, which was prexdously known from the United States 

 by one record from ^''ictoria, Texas, ^ is represented by two females

1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 781 



from Thomasville, taken in October, 1903, and on January 9, 1904. 

 These individuals, as is the ease with the Texan specimens, are 

 referable to the "var. a" of Saussure and Zehntner. 



The specimen of this species which was taken on January 9, 1904, 

 I found dead on the sidewalk of Jackson street, under a large live oak. 

 (M. H.) 



Family MANTID^. 

 Stagmomantis Carolina (Johansson). 



This species is represented in the collection by immature individuals 

 taken in July and August, and adults taken in August, September and 

 October. 



Gonatista grisea (Fabricius). 



A single specimen of this species from Thomasville was examined. 

 It was taken in early winter resting on the dead leaves of a small water 

 oak. 



Thesprotia graminis (Scudder). 



This species is represented in the Thomasville materia! by two 

 somewhat immature individuals taken August 19 and September 30, 

 1903. 



This species is found in the wire-grass which carpets the pine forest, 

 and which it so closely resembles that the closest scrutiny is required 

 to reveal its presence. (M. H.) 



Family PHASMIDiB. 

 Anisomorpha buprestoides (Stoll). 



This species is represented by specimens taken at Thomasville, 

 March 20, 1903, and at Tyty Plantation, Thomas county, December 

 12. 1903. The latter individuals, a pair, were taken on pine in coitu. 



A number of half-grown specimens of this species were taken by 

 beating the gall-berry bushes growing near a "branch" which crosses 

 the river road nearly two miles from town. (M. H.) 



Family ACRIDID.^. 

 Acrydium arenosum (Burmeister). 



This species is found common in the vicinity of water, on sandy 

 beaches and wet soil, but probably is local in its distribution even in 

 such environment, as it was taken at but three points. In a piece of 

 bayou country, amid cypress and black gum, on the Ocklockonee 

 river west of Thomasville, this species was taken on February 29, March 

 29 and April 1 and 9, 1904. In the vicinity of a small lake in northern 

 Leon county, specimens were taken on March 21, 1903, and March 22, 

 1904. The series examined consists of sixty specimens, and exliibits 




782 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



a great amount of variation in the rugosity of the pronotum, the char- 

 acter of the median carina of the pronotum, and a slight amount of 

 color variation, the latter chiefly in the intensity of the pair of spots 

 posterior to the humeral angles. 

 Neotettix bolteri Hancock. 



A single specimen of what appears to be this species was taken in 

 Leon county, March 22, 1904, in swampy ground at the edge of a small 

 lake. 



Neotettix femoratus (Scudder). 



A variable and interesting series of specimens from Thomasville, 

 taken in late June, early July, September and October, 1903, and 

 April 9 and 10, 1904, are referable to this species. While a great 

 amount of variation is exhibited by the specimens examined, they 

 appear, after comparison with the type, to represent Scudder's species. 

 Three individuals belong to a type with the posterior portion of the 

 pronotum elongate. 



This species, during the summer, was found moderatelv plentiful. 

 (M. H.) 



Paratettix texanus Hancock. 



Three Thomasville specimens, two males, one female, are contained 

 in the series examined. They were taken on marshy meadow or sandy 

 beach at Linton's Pond on March 21, April 10, 1904. This species has 

 been recorded from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and South 

 Carolina. Its status appears to be more likely that of a mere subspecies 

 of P. cucullatus. 

 Tettigidea spicata Morse. 



This species is represented by a series of seventeen specimens taken 

 at two localities in Thomas county. At one point about two miles 

 west of Thomasville, in wet pine woods, it was taken on December 14, 

 1903, April 9, 1904; while on February 29, March 29 and April 1 it 

 was taken in bayou country along the Ocldockonee river. A form 

 with the pronotum elongate is represented by four specimens, two of 

 each sex. 

 Tettigidea lateralis (Say). 



This species was very abundant in moist localities in Thomas and 

 Leon counties. In bottom land as well as on sandy stretches and 

 moist meadow this interesting little locust was noted. Specimens 

 examined were taken in the months of February, IMarch, April, July, 

 August and September. The series examined, over one hundred and 

 thirty in number, exhibits a considerable amount of variation in size 

 and in the angulation of the anterior margin of the pronotum. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 783 



Radinotatum brevipenne (Thomas). 



This interesting and peculiar species is mainly a common inhabitant 

 of pine woods in Thomas and Leon counties. It lives among the dried 

 needles and apparently depends for safety more on protective resem- 

 blance and coloration than on anything else, as the saltatorial powers 

 are limited and the flight organs useless. Three color types are repre- 

 sented in the series of one hundred and eleven specimens examined, 

 one type being uniform brownish of varying shades, another brownish 

 with the dorsal surface of the head, pronotum and tegmina grass green, 

 and the third brownish with the lateral aspect greenish. From the 

 material examined it would appear that around Thomasville the species 

 is represented by mature individuals in late spring and early summer 

 (April to Jul}'), September individuals being extremely small, while 

 a large number of November, December and March specimens show a 

 gradual increase in size. The peculiar character of the subgenital 

 plate of the male is pronounced in specimens taken in November. 

 Color notes from life: Green phase, nymph, Thomasville, Georgia, 

 November 30, 1903; color of the dorsal surface, antennae, eyes, mandi- 

 bles, labrum, median and anterior limbs, posterior tibise and tips of the 

 posterior femora wood brown; lateral aspects, face, meso- and meta- 

 sternum and posterior femora (except the distal portions) apple green. 

 Brown phase, nymph, Thomasville, Georgia, November 30, 1903; gen- 

 eral color wood brown, obscurely and rather irregularly lined and spot- 

 ted with broccoli brown, a rather distinct postocular and pronotal 

 streak being developed; posterior femora with the apical portions 

 blackish. The color of adult males is grass green on the dorsal surface 

 of the pronotum and tegmina, the abdomen, lateral aspect and dorsal 

 surface of the femora as in the immature ; inferior margin of the lateral 

 lobes of the pronotum pale ochraceous. The adult female is uniform 

 wood brown, except the eyes, which are umber obscurely spotted with 

 darker brown. One adult female, however, has a green and brown 

 coloration, but the pattern is exactly the reverse of that found in the 

 males, the green being lateral instead of dorsal. Several specimens 

 examined are strongly overcast with blackish spots. 



I noticed many immature specimens of this species pale straw brown 

 in color, and one or two specimens taken were profusely marked with 

 small black dots. On April 7, 1904, I noticed several mature males of 

 this species in the sprouting broom sedge at the edge of the golf course 

 near thick woods. Returning to this place two days later, I took a 

 number of mature males and several females almost adult. These 

 males were nearly all of the green form, while the females were entirely 




784 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



brown. Returning to this place on the next day, I at last succeeded in 

 taking a mature female. {M. H.) 



Syrbula admirabilis (Uhler). 



Seven specimeiLS of this species taken at Thomasville, in 1903, have 

 been examined. Four of the seven are immature and were taken on 

 June 30, July 6, 7 and 16. The fom- adults were taken June 30 (d^), 

 July 6(9), September 30 ( 9 ) and December 14 ( 9 ). An interesting 

 feature noticed in this series, and substantiated by other material 

 from the Middle Atlantic States, is the transition from a depressed 

 cnsiform antennae in the immature form to a slender, subfiliform type 

 in the adult. From a phylogenetic standpoint this fact would indicate 

 a type with ensiform antenna), like Mefmiria, as the ancestor of the 

 genus Syrbula. 



I captured one female specimen of this species in damp low pine 

 woods in December. (M. H.) 

 Amblytropidia occidentalis (Saussure). 



This modestly colored but lively species is almost without exception 

 found in pine and black gum woods, but in pine woods the species is 

 more abundant than elsewhere, being found in association with Radino- 

 tatum and Aptenopedes. The series examined contains ninety-eight 

 specimens from Thomas and Leon counties, and exhibits a great amount 

 of variation in color and some in structure. In some female speci- 

 mens the pronotum is more expanded than in others, and the head also 

 appears slightly stouter. The amount of color variation is remark- 

 able, though confined to browns and grays. From an extreme black- 

 ish-brown form all intergrades are present to types of a uniform sienna 

 and ashy gray. Some individuals are obscurely lined on each side of 

 the median carina of the pronotum. The following color notes are 

 from life: Female, Thomasville, November 30, 1903; general color 

 mars brown and mummy brown spotted and streaked; eyes broccoli 

 brown; posterior femora laterally mars brown, darkest dorsally, above 

 wood brown with a few mars brown spots, beneath pinkish-vinaceous, 

 internally milky white blotched with blackish and dull brown; posterior 

 tibiffi basally wood brown becoming bluish-black apically; abdomen 

 with the dorsal surface pale ochraceous-rufous, laterally wood brown 

 washed blackish basally, each segment with the apical margin milky 

 white; inferior surface pinkish-vinaceous. Female, Thomas\'ille, No- 

 vember 30, 1903; similar to the specimen described above, except that 

 the dorsal surface is overcast wdth a pale whitish suffusion and the 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum, the pleura and the gense and postocular 

 regions of the head are suffused with dull orange-rufous. The only 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 785 



immature specimen in the series examined was taken on November 30. 

 The adults were taken on dates extending from the latter part of 

 October to the early part of April. 



This species of the pine forest, although it is singularly protected by 

 its coloration when in its favorite haunt among the pine needles, is, 

 nevertheless, a most wary and active species. Both males and females 

 fly Avith the greatest rapidity and when alarmed will keep on the wing 

 for a considerable distance. When approached quietly they will 

 spring up with great speed, but onl}^ fly a short distance. DiA-ing 

 into a tuft of wire-grass and pine needles, they seem to literally glide 

 down to the most obscure place at the roots of the grass, where, 

 although perfectly hid, they remain alert and upon the approach of 

 anything make another rapid flight to some still safer place. I have 

 never been able to ascertain how these insects are able to start out of 

 the center of a thick tuft of grass at full speed and dive into the very 

 center of another in the space of time required by them. This is the 

 only species I know of that can slip out of one's hand when, after 

 approaching wdthin a few inches of the specimen, one pounces upon it. 

 It can not only do this, however, but can escape with such speed that 

 track of it is very easily lost. (M. H.) 



Orphulella pratorum Scudder. 



This species is, judging from the amount of material examined, 

 exceedingly abundant at Thomasville from late June to late October, 

 but particularly in September; while individuals taken in November, 

 December, May and early June show its presence then, but probably 

 not in such numbers as in summer and early fall. The series examined 

 numbers four hundred and twenty-four specimens and represents all 

 types and shades of coloration, as well as illustrating the great diversity 

 in size exhibited by specimens of the female sex. 



Dichromorplia viridis (Scudder). 



This species is represented by a series of one hundred and forty-three 

 specimens from Thomasville, taken in the months from June to 

 December inclusive. As usual in the species, great variation in size 

 is exhibited by the series, and both color forms are represented, the 

 green being greatly in the majority. 



Arphia xanthoptera (Burmeister). 



This species is represented in the material studied bj^ four specimens, 

 one male and three females, taken at Thomasville, March 16, Septem- 

 ber 24, November 30 and December 10. 



Between December and March a stray specimen of this species may 

 occasionally be met with in the oak and hickory woods. (M. H.) 




786 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ^DeC, 



Arphia granulata Saussure. 



A male and female of this species from Thomas\'ille, taken May 27, 

 1903, have been examined. 



Arphia sulphurea (Fabricius). 



Specimens of this species were taken in Leon county, and at Thomas- 

 \dlle, in ^larch and April, in pine woods. An immature specimen 

 taken in January has also been examined. 



This species appeared to be moderately common in the spring of 

 1903 in pine woods with many scrub oaks about. I found the imma- 

 ture specimens of this species plentiful throughout the winter months 

 in dead leaves under oak, hickory and sweet gum trees. (^I. H.) 



Chortophaga viridifasciata (DeGeer). 



This common species is represented by a series of ninet3'-two speci- 

 mens, the brown phase outnumbering the green form. The series 

 covers adult specimens taken in everv^ month of the year. 



I have found this species late into December in colonies along the 

 edge of woods. (M. H.) 



Hippiscus phoenicopterus (Burmeister). 



The species is represented by specimens taken in ^lay (27th) and 

 June (2d and 8th), 1903, at Thomas\ille. 



Hippiscus rugosus (Scudder). 



A single specimen taken at Thomasville on August 13, 1903, I have 

 referred to this species. It has, however, cinnabar wings, but struc- 

 turally is inseparable from Pennsylvania specimens of rugosus. 



Dissosteira Carolina (Linnseus). 



This species is represented by specimens from Thomasville taken 

 May 25 and 26, June 8 and 12, and July 27, and from Metcalfe taken 

 September 17. One specimen taken July 27 is immature. 



Spharagemon boUi Scudder. 



A single male specimen of this species is included in the material 

 examined. It was taken at Thomas^dlle, July 14, 1903. 



Spharagemon coUare wyomingianum (Thomas). 



A series of nine Thomas\ille specimens are assigned here with some 

 uncertainty. They agree with New Jersey specimens of wyomingianum 

 except for the sharper fastigium, which also forms a more acute angle 

 with the face. Considerable color and minor structural variations 

 are exhibited by this series. The specimens were taken in June, July, 

 August and November. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 787 



Psinidia fenestralis (Serville). 



This sand-loving species is represented by a series of eighteen speci- 

 mens taken on dates extending from June to November. 



I took one specimen of this species on November 30, a mature female 

 so battered and worn it could scarcely fly. (M. H.) 

 Trimerotropis citrina Scudder. 



This species which is here recorded from the Southeastern States for 

 the first tune, Is represented by a series of sixteen specimens taken at 

 Thomasville and Metcalfe, ilay, June and September are the months 

 represented by the material studied. 

 Dictyophorus guttatus (Stoll).^ 



This large and striking species is fairly numerous in southern Georgia, 

 and attains full size b}'- August. Several imagos taken in August, 

 September and October have been examined, one male being of small 

 size. Another comparatively small male from Brunswick, Gljmn 

 county, Georgia, is in the collection of the Academy. 



I have found very j^oung specimens of this species as early as the 

 first week in April. They were then in colonies of a dozen or more in 

 the pine woods. (M. H.) 

 Stenaoris' cWorizans Walker. 



This cat-tail loving species is represented by several Thomasville 

 specimens and eight individuals from Leon county, Florida. The for- 

 mer series was taken on March 7. 1903. and March 25, 1904, the exact 

 locality being a large boggy meadow cut by numerous streams, formerly 

 covered by a dammed body of water locally known as Mitchell's Pond. 

 Several specimens were also noticed, but not taken, at a large pond sev- 

 eral miles north of Thomas\'ille. The Leon county specimens were all 

 taken on the margins of a large pond in the extreme northern part of 

 the county, within half a mile of the Georgia line, on March 21, 1903, 

 and March 22, 1904. 



But four of the series examined have the white lateral line distinct, 

 the others being almost unicolorous, two, however, having the upper 

 surface sufTused with rosaceous. 



I found this interesting species the most numerous among the cat- 

 tails growing in the de ep water at the edge of the pond. When alarmed 



r ^ It is evident that StoU's Gryllus guttatus (Natuurl. Afbeeld. Beschr. Zabel- 

 .tpringhinen, Trek-springhanen, Krekels en Kakkerlakken, p. 23, and Register, p. 

 12, PI. X6, fig. 34) is the same as Thunbcrg's Didyophorus reticulatus, and is two 

 years earlier. 



^ This generic name is revived in place of ArniHa St&l, which it antedates by 

 three years. It was proposed {Catal. Derm. Salt. Brit. Mus., IV, p. 651, 1870) 

 for three species, lanceolata concolor and chlorizans the latter of which can 

 be selected as the typo. 




788 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



it would at once fly swiftly and silently away to the stem of a cat-tail, 

 apparently in a safe place, and would then, when approached, dodge 

 around to the opposite side and remain motionless, pressing itself to 

 the stem, which I noticed would almost invariably be the same color 

 as itself. It could then be taken by a stealthy approach and a 

 quick grasp of the hand, for it seemed to rely on its resemblance to its 

 support and would not take wing unless alarmed by a quick movement 

 or a too close approach. When badly alarmed I noticed several speci- 

 mens fly up into the trees and hide on the small twigs, as they had before 

 done on the cat-tails. Not one of the species was to be found on the 

 brownish rushes where Leptysma was common, which latter species 

 was precisely the color of its surroundings. The flight of this species is 

 much stronger and more rapid than that of L. marginicollis , and owing 

 to this fact and the locality in which it is found, it is quite difficult to take 

 a specimen when thoroughly alarmed. Those specimens seen on the 

 meadow where Mitchell's Pond had once been were afforded poor cover, 

 as the grass was short, and I noticed that they would almost always 

 take flight when I was still a number of feet distant, no matter how 

 cautiously I approached. (M. H.) 



Leptysma marginicollis (Serville). 



This species, which is somewhat similar in habit to the preceding, is 

 represented by specimens taken at Thomasville during March and in 

 Leon county on March 22, 1904. 



This species was most numerous among the dried rushes on the edge 

 of the pond in Leon county mentioned as the habitat of the preceding 

 species. The specimens were easily alarmed by a quick movement, but 

 could be easily approached and grasped if this was done in a slow and 

 careful manner. They were as well protected by their color on these 

 brown rushes as the S. chlorizans were with their bright green colora- 

 tion on the cat-tails whose stems were the same color ; the latter species, 

 however, showed much less confidence in its concealment and was 

 much more difficult to approach. (M. H.) 

 Schistooerca amerioana (Drury). 



This elusive and powerful species is represented by eight specimens 

 taken at Thomasville in January, March, May, October and December. 

 Leon county is represented by specimens taken in March. 



Much of the time this species is common in the open pine woods. 

 Its fhght is powerful and it usually takes refuge on the pine trunks 

 over eight feet from the ground. Its color blends remarkably with the 

 bark, and it, remaining motionless, with hind femora drawn closely to 

 the body ready to spring, does not take flight until closely approached. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 789 



Like the two preceding species, even the heaviest females fly well, and 

 I have never seen one jump except when in such close quarters that 

 flight was impossible. (M. H.) 



Schistoceroa damnifica (Saussure). 



An interesting series of fifty specimens of this species is included in 

 the material studied. The females are all larger than Northern speci- 

 mens, and have the median stripe of the pronotum more obscure. 

 The males, however, are very similar to New Jersey representatives, 

 except that the tegmina appear to be slightly longer. The material 

 comprises adults taken in every month in the year except August. 



The males of this species are active and are found common in the dead 

 leaves under scrub oaks, hickories, sweet gums and other trees in the 

 pine woods. They fly well and are so much the color of their surround- 

 ings that they are very hard to follow. The females are, on the other 

 hand, invariably large and unwieldy, and seem to find great difficulty 

 in even jumping, and they very seldom fly. (M. H.) 



Gymnoscistetes pusillus Scudder. 



This very peculiar species was found by Mr. Hebard to be fairly 

 common in one locality near Thomasville, and a series of twenty-one 

 individuals, sixteen males and five females, are included in the series 

 studied. They are quite constant in size, but in a number of other 

 characters considerable variation is exhibited. The anterior and 

 posterior margins of the pronotum are truncate in some, emarginate 

 in others ; the number of spines on the external margins of the posterior 

 tibiae varies from eight to ten; the median carina of the pronotum is 

 quite distinct in some, absent in others, while the inferior portion of 

 the frontal costa varies greatly in the strength of the constriction. 

 Color is rather constant, such variation as is exhibited being in intensity 

 and not pattern. The females are uniformly lighter in color than the 

 males. 



The following color notes were made from a fresh male specimen: 

 Dark lateral bars seal brown, light lateral bars pale glaucous green be- 

 coming emerald-green on the meta- and mesopleura; dorsal surface 

 a semi-metallic drab becoming quite pale toward the dark lateral 

 bars ; eyes of the same color as the dark lateral bars, obscurely spotted 

 with drab; antennae of the same color as the dorsal surface, strongly 

 suffused with blackish apically; limbs very pale yellowish-green 

 minutely blotched with umber. 



I took one specimen of this species in the wire-grass of the pine forest 

 near town on November 30, 1904, but although I searched the locality 




790 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



carefully for several days no more were taken. A short time later I 

 discovered a colony of this species in a similar situation on the river 

 road, about two miles from town. They were very difficult to capture, 

 as it took the most intent searching before a specimen could be found, 

 and even then it was by no means an easy matter to make the capture, 

 for these small grasshoppers are masters of the art of jumping. They 

 can jump so quickly that OTsdng to their color the eye cannot follow 

 them, and the strangest thing is that they can jump in any direction 

 with such rapidity that it is wholly impossible to see in which dhection 

 they have gone. They jump from one tuft of wire-grass to the top of 

 another tuft and there cling tightly to the highest straw ready to make 

 another leap. Although they are so small I have seen them frequently 

 spring several feet. The females, although much heavier than the 

 males, are almost equally agile. This species has the habit of edging 

 around its support when approached and remaining motionless with 

 hind femora drawn close to the bod^^ It can be seen, however, to 

 be watching that which has alarmed it most closely, and on the first 

 quick movement or on too near approach it jumps at once. (M. H.) 



Melanoplus scudderi (Uhler). 



It was with considerable surprise that this species was recognized 

 in the collections, as the distribution of it is thus extended a consider- 

 able distance southward. Six male and sixteen female specimens from 

 Thomas^alle have been examined, taken November 30, 1903, Decem- 

 ber 1, 3, 5, 6 and 10, 1903, and December 14, 1902. There is consider- 

 able A-ariation in the coloration, some being unicolorous, others 

 sprinkled with small blackish dots and maculations. 



Color of live male: Thomasville, November 30, 1903; general colors 

 burnt umber and cinnamon mingled in a pepper-and-salt combination, 

 the paler tint predominating toward the lower surface ; lateral bar on 

 the upper part of the prozona seal brown ; posterior femora with the 

 external bars not very distincth^ marked, the internal bars milky 

 pink and dull seal brown, the whole overcast with the general "pepper- 

 and-salt" suffusion; posterior tibise scarlet vermilion ;' under surface 

 of the body and posterior femora gamboge yellow suffused anteriorly 

 and posteriorly vdih gray-brown, clear on the basal segments of the 

 abdomen. Female : color much as in the male, but the under surface 

 duller and the pronotum dorsalh' suffused with fawn color and the 

 lateral bar on the prozona rather indistinct; antennse reddish-brown, 

 grading from poppy red at the base to maroon apicalh'. 



This species is moderately plentiful during the fall months in the 

 pine woods. Its color blends almost exactly with the pine needles, 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 791 



and it is for this reason that, although it is a slow species at taking 

 alarm and poor at jumping, it is sometimes hard to capture. (M. H.) 



Melanoplus sylvestris Morse. 



This recently described species is apparently represented by three 

 female specimens taken at Thomasville and Metcalfe in September, 

 November and December, 1903. The original specimens were all from 

 western North Carolina. When compared with specimens of M. 

 islandicus, females of sylvestris can be separated by the precurrent 

 median carina of the pronotum, the broader metazona, the more pro- 

 nounced sulcation of the frontal costa, and the more quadrate interval 

 between the mesosternal lobes. 



Found in the same places as the preceding species, but more agile 

 and easily alarmed. Its coloration affords it even greater protection 

 than that of M. sciidderi. (M. H.) 

 Melanoplus nigrescens (Scudder). 



A series of fifteen males and seventeen females represents this large 

 and rather striking species. All the specimens are from Thomasville, 

 and were taken in November and December. Considerable variation 

 is exhibited in the shape of the cerci of the males. 



Color of live specimens: Female; Thomasville, November 30, 1903; 

 general color mummy brown, the "pepper-and-salt" effect caused by 

 a minute speckling of pale wood brown, postocular streak clear 

 mummy brown, eyes mars brown, antennae with the base wood 

 brown and the apical portion vandyke brown; tegmina with the 

 anal field clear wood brown, discoidal and costal regions mummy 

 brown; stripe on the metapleura and the paler bars on the hind 

 femora ecru drab, dark bars on the femora seal brown; posterior 

 tibiae blackish basally, dull maroon apically. Male; Thomasville, 

 November 30, 1903; general color clove-brown becoming dull umber 

 on the anal field of the tegmina ; lateral lobes of the pronotum 

 and lower part of head deep blue-gray blending into the general tint 

 of the upper surface; eyes mottled clove brown and wood brown; 

 stripe on metapleura and pale bars and spots on posterior femora 

 almost pm-e white, suffused slightly with grayish toward the dorsal 

 surface; dark bars on the posterior femora and base color of meso- 

 and metapleura solid black; anterior and median limbs similar to 

 the lower part of the head in color; posterior tibiae apically poppy red, 

 dull on the superior surface, basal portion blackish with a dull rcddish- 

 pregenicular annulus; surface of the mcso- and metasternum dull 

 glaucous green, of the under surface of the abdomen gamboge yellow. 




792 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



During November and December I have found this splendid species 

 in colonies among the pine woods. It preferred the vicinity of the 

 scrub oaks, and it was among these that I found a group of over a dozen 

 specimens of this species within the space of a few square yards. The 

 males seemed peculiarly unwary, and occasionally one would be almost 

 trodden before it would jump. Earlier in the season, during the warm 

 fall weather, they probably exhibited much greater activity, for I 

 noticed them to feel cold severely and the slightest cooler weather 

 would greatly thin their numbers. All the specimens I took were 

 probably at their prime several weeks earlier, and from this I conclude 

 that the best time to take this species is toward the latter part of 

 October and during early November. The females were more unwieldy 

 than the males but were very powerful. Both sexes, owing to the 

 shortness of their wings, were wholly unable to fly. (M. H.) 

 Melanoplus keeleri (Thomas). 



This species is represented by a series of twenty males and twenty- 

 nine females taken at Thomasville in September, October, November 

 and December. The intensity of the coloration is quite variable. 



This species is found in the same locality and at the same time as 

 the preceding species, but in greater numbers. The males are much 

 smaller than the females, and are therefore less powerful, but they are 

 able to fly well and are occasionally quite shy. The females are usually 

 unable to fly at the time I was collecting as it was late in the season, 

 and all were more or less worn. (M. H.) 



Melanoplus clypeatus (Scudder). 



Four female specimens of this species from Thomasville, taken 

 August 3 and December 17, 1903, have been examined. They have 

 longer tegmina (22-22.5 mm.) than the female measured by Scudder. 



Melanoplus propinquus Scudder. 



This is the most abundant species of the genus at Thomasville, and 

 in consequence it is represented by a very large series — three hundred 

 and forty-eight in number. The months represented by the material 

 are January, INIay, June, July, August, September, October and De- 

 cember. 



This species has almost the exact habits of its close northern ally, 

 M. femur-ruhrum. It is found in great numbers in all open country 

 during the summer and fall and is quite plentiful even in the spring. 

 (M.H.) 



Melanoplus atlanis (Riley). 



This destructive species is represented by five male individuals 

 from Thomasville, taken in April, July, October and December. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 793 



This species is common in the corn fields ckirino; -svarm weather. 

 (M. H.) 



Paroxya atlantioa Scudder. 



A series of thirteen specimens were taken at Thomasville and Tyty 

 Plantation in June, August, October and December. The males agree 

 very well with two specimens of that sex, one from Ormond, Florida. 

 the other from Florida without further data. 



Found along the branches. (M. H.) 



Paroxya floridiana (Thomas). 



This marsh-loving species is abundant at Thomasville in late summer 

 and fall, and is represented by a series of one hundred and sixty-five indi- 

 viduals, taken in July, August, September and December. Consider- 

 able variation in color is exliibited by this assemblage, as is usual in 

 the species, but the extremes are connected by numbers of intermedi- 

 ates. 



Found in great abundance along all streams and in all damp spots 

 during the warm weather. I took quite a series of tattered specimens 

 of this species in a sheltered spot along the edge of a branch in Decem- 

 ber, 1903. (M. H.) 

 Aptenopedes sphenarioides Scudder. 



This beautiful and common species is found usually in the pine woods 

 among the dead needles and wire-grass. The series comprises two 

 hundred and fifty-six specimens, about equally divided between the 

 sexes. The months represented by the material are January, Febru- 

 ary, March, April, June, August, September, October, November and 

 December. The species was observed in Leon county in the latter 

 part of March. Some individuals possess but one tegmen, and in a 

 few individuals both tegmina are missing. This latter condition ap- 

 pears to be abnormal, as the specimens are otherwise inseparable^ 

 and arc quite distinct from a specimen of altera from Miami, Florida. 

 After comparing the types of A. clara Ilehn^ with individuals of 

 sphenarioides, the former is seen to be immediately distinguishable by 

 the peculiar cerci. Two color phases are present, one purplish-brown,, 

 the other a rich paris green. The following notes have been made from 

 living adult specimens. Green phase: female; Thomasville, November 

 30, 1903; general color paris green, on the under surface becoming pale 

 and on the sides of the abdomen suffused with whitish; eyes mummy 

 brown; antennie dull crimson, infuscatc apically; lateral line on the 

 pronotum and tegmina composed of two colors, above peach blossom

794- PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



pink, below blackish; lower margin of the pronotum very narrowly 

 lined with white ; anterior and median femora of the body color ; tibiae 

 dull crimson; posterior femora with the lateral face of the body color, 

 darkest above; inferior carina white, superior carina bicolor similar 

 to the tegmina, genicular arches black; posterior tibiae glaucous blue, 

 spines whitish with the tips black. Green phase: male; Thomas ville, 

 November 30, 1903; general color of the upper surface paris green 

 becoming apple green on the sides and under surface; eyes mummy 

 brown finely sprinkled wdth wood brown; lateral lines practically the 

 same colors as in the female, except that the rosy tint Ls paler on the 

 pronotum than on the tegmina; abdomen with the median portion 

 dull salmon flanked with pure black, the latter carrying a small white 

 spot at the apical margin of each segment; in other respects similar 

 to the female. 



Brown phase: female; Thomasville, November 30, 1903; general 

 color of the dorsal surface broccoli brown, overcast with an irregular 

 hoary suffusion of ecru drab, this being limited to the median portions 

 of the segments on the abdomen; lateral lines much as in the green 

 phase, but more subdued and the usual pinkish stripe on the tegmina 

 rather brownish; face, eyes, genae, lateral lobes of the pronotum, 

 pleura and external faces of the posterior femora, as well as the anterior 

 and median limbs, vandyke brown obscurely scrumbled with broccoli 

 brown ; lower margin of the pronotum and lower carina of the external 

 face of the posterior femora whitish ; posterior tibiae maroon. Brown 

 phase: male; Thomasville, November 30, 1903; general color much as 

 in the female, but the hoar}^ suffusion weaker; lateral line well marked 

 and more ecru than pinkish; pronotum with the blackish tint weak; 

 the inferior external carinae of the posterior femora with a broken white 

 line; superior face of posterior femora scrumbled wood brown; an- 

 tennae whitish. Nymph ; November 30, 1903 ; general color wood 

 brown obscurely lined and spotted with mummy brown; upper portion 

 of lateral lobes of the pronotum and postocular region blackish. 



I have always found this species prevalent except during the cold 

 weather of late December, January and the greater part of February. 

 This species is to be found almost every^'here in the pine woods, but 

 is more abundant where the wire-grass-grows heaviest near the 

 ''branches." The males are very active, springing with alacrity and 

 often alighting on weed stalks and \dnes a foot or more above the 

 ground, where they remain motionless but watchful, ready to spring 

 to another place if approached. The females, being much heavier, arc 

 less spry, but nevertheless sometimes difficult to capture. (M. H.)

 Arethaea phalangium (Scudder). 



A single male individual of this species was taken at Thomasville, 

 June 29. 1903. 

 Scadderia texensis Saussure and Pictet. 



This is the commonest species of the genus in the vicinity of Thomas- 

 ville, and it is represented by a series of twenty-eight specimens repre- 

 senting both sexes. They were taken in May, June, July, September 

 and October. 



Scudderia furcata Brunner. 



One female and three male specimens represent this species. They 

 were taken at Thomasville in the second week of October and Decem- 

 ber 14, 1903. 



The specimen taken in December was beaten from gall-berry bushes 

 in the pine woods, and was in a battered condition. (M. H.) 

 Scudderia cuneata Morse. 



This recently described species is represented by two male individ- 

 uals taken at Thomas\dlle, on August 17 and September 10, 1903. 

 This record extends the range of the species east of the type locality — 

 Alabama. 



Amblycorypha oblongifolia (DeGeer). 



This species is represented by four Thomasville specimens, two males, 

 two females, taken July 29. August 4, 8 and 26, 1903. The males 

 have the tympanum of the tegmina narrower than in Maryland, Dela- 

 ware and Pennsylvania specimens of the species, but nevertheless 

 do not appear separable. 

 Amblycorypha uhleri Stil. 



One male and one female representative of this species have been 

 examined, both taken at Thomasville, one on July 16, 1903, the other 

 in the second week of October, 1903. 



Belocephalus subapterus Scudder. 



One female specimen of this species was taken at Thomasville, 

 August 24, 1903. This is the first record outside of the State of Florida. 

 Conocephalus atlanticus Brunner. 



A scries of three males of this species from Thomasville have been 

 examined. They were taken September 12, 15 and 17, 1903, and on 

 comparison with paratypes prove inseparable. 

 Conocephalus retusus Scudder. 



A single female taken at Thomasville, September 17, 1903, is referred 

 to this species. The specimen has the tegmina and ovipositor slightly 




796 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



longer than Scudder's original measurements, but the specimen appears 



to belong here. 



Conocephalus mexicanus Saussure. 



Two female specimens of this species were taken at Thomasville, 

 December 3, 1903, in undergrowth in pine woods, and on March 10, 

 1904. 



Both specimens taken were in good condition; the first was taken 

 among the dead brown leaves of a hickory in the pine woods, where it 

 was very conspicuous on account of its bright green color. (M. H.) 



Conocephalus fuscostriatus Redtenbacher. 



. Three male Thomas\alle specimens of this species have been exam- 

 ined. One is without date, the others were taken March 16 and April 

 4, 1904, and all are typical representatives of the species. 



This species appeared early in March and was soon plentiful in the 

 woods, especially in the broom sedge in damp locations. The speci- 

 mens, when pursued, always took to wing and made off with a strong 

 but zigzag flight, never alighting until quite a distance had been tra- 

 versed. I followed one specimen for several hundred yards across a 

 field and finally lost sight of it, as it had flown up until some forty feet 

 above the ground, and could not be followed by the eye in the twilight. 

 The males begin their serenade just as dusk begins to fall and keep up 

 a continuous zeeeee late into the night. Their song is, however, not 

 nearly so ear-splitting as that of C. mexicanus. (M, H.) 



Orchelimum glaberrimum (Burmeister). 



This large species is represented by a series of thirty-one individuals 

 representing both sexes. They are all from Thomas ville, taken in 

 August and September, 1903. A considerable amount of variation 

 is exhibited in the intensity of the brown markings on the pronotum. 



Orchelimum nitidum (Redtenbacher). 



A series of fifty-seven specimens of both sexes represents this species. 

 They are all from Thomas ville, taken in August and September, 1903. 

 The remark made under 0. glaberrimum regarding markings on the 

 pronotum applies with equal force to this species. 

 Orchelimum nigripes Scudder. 



A single female of this species was taken at Thomas ville on August 

 4, 1903. This is the first record for the Gulf States. 



Orchelimum cuticulare Serville ? 



A single male individual, taken at Thomasville on August 28, 1903, is 

 v?ry doubtfully referred to this species.

Xiphidion fasciatum (DeGeer). 



This widely distributed species is represented by a series of ninety- 

 five specimens, all from Thomas ville. The months represented are 

 June, August, September, October and December (one specmien), 1903. 



I took but one specimen of this species, that in December. 1903. It 

 was procured among tall grass in a swamp}^ hollow. (M. H.) 

 Xiphidion brevipenne Scudder. 



Tliree females and four males of this species from Thomasville have 

 been examined. They were taken in August, September. October 

 and December, 1903. 



The single specimen of this species which I took in December, 1903, 

 was secured in the damp undergrowth of the pine woods near a 

 ''branch." (M. H.) 



Xiphidion saltans Scudder. 



Two females and five males of this species are included in the mate- 

 rial studied. They were taken at Thomas^dlle in September, October 

 and November, 1903, the one taken in the latter month being from 

 meadow land. 



Odontoxiphidium apterum Morse. 



This recently described genus and species is represented by a series 

 of twenty males and twenty-two females, all from Thomasville, taken 

 in September, October, November and December, 1903. Those indi- 

 viduals bearing information in addition to the date and locality are 

 labelled as having been taken in undergrowth in pine woods. The 

 series agrees very well with the description, exhibiting the color varia- 

 tion noted in the original series. 



The specimens which I took of this species were all captured in the 

 wire-grass of the pine woods. Although active, they were easily cap- 

 tured. (M. H.) 



A male specimen of this species from Brunswick, Glynn county, 

 Georgia, taken September, 1881, is in the collection of the Academy. 



Atlanticus gibbosus Scudder. 



As far as can be determined from the very inadequate description 

 and the immature condition of the majority of the twelve specimens 

 examined, I should refer the representatives of this genus to gibbosufi. 

 But one individual, a female, is fully grown, the others being in such 

 condition as make them almost useless for study. The dates repre- 

 sented are :\Iarch 16, 17, 22, 23, 24 and 29 April 9, July 23 (adult) and 

 December 10, all from Thomasville. 



In December, March and April I have found immature individuals 

 of this species plentiful in the pine woods, where they live among the

 oiGymnoscirtetes pusillus. (M. H.) 

 Ceuthophilus virgatipes n. sp. 



Types: d^ and ? ; Thomasville, Thomas count}', Georgia. August 

 13, 1903. Collection of Morgan Hebard. 



Closely allied to C. secretus Scudder, but differing in the longer 

 median internal calcaria and the much shorter ovipositor. Relation- 

 ship also exists with C. varicator Scudder, but that species has the 

 first tarsal joint as long as the others united, as well as having a long 

 ovipositor. 



Size medium; body compressed. Head wdth the occiput declivent, 

 vertex somewhat flattened ; interspace between the eyes equal to the 

 long diameter of one of them; eyes inverted subpjTiform; antennae 

 rather short and rather heavy, but slightly longer than the body; 

 terminal palpal joint distinctly longer than the third. Pronotum 

 strongly compressed ; anterior margin wnth a slight median emargina- 

 tion, posterior margin truncate ; lateral lobes slightly longer than high, 

 inferior margin moderately arcuate, the anterior angle by no means as 

 apparent as the posterior; surface of the pronotum as well as the 

 mesonotum and metanotum obscurely tuberculate, more pronounced 

 in the female than in the male. Abdomen strongly compressed, the 

 exposed portion of each segment roughened and picked. Cerci short, 

 thick basally, tapering. Ovipositor short, thick basally, apical half 

 subequal, margins almost straight, superior angle produced into a dis- 

 tinct spiniform process, internal valves wdth five apical spines. Ante- 

 rior femora a third as long again as the pronotum, armed on the ante- 

 rior inferior margin with 3-0 spines, unarmed on the posterior margin. 

 Median femora about equal to the anterior in length, armed on the 

 anterior margin with three spines which are larger in the female than 

 in the male, and increase in size distally, posterior margin armed with 

 two or three spines. Posterior femora thick and short, strongly bullate, 

 the apical third slender, inferior margins with irregularly disposed 

 serrations, intervening sulcus comparatively broad; posterior femora 

 distinctly more than a tenth longer than the femora, not bowed, spm-s 

 large, median calcaria extremely long, the internal equalling the meta- 

 tarsus; second and fourth tarsal joints subequal, third decidedly less 

 than half the length of second; metatarsus shorter than the other

Family GRYLLID^ 

 Gryllotalpa borealis Burmeister. 



Several specimens of this species from Thomasville have been exam- 

 ined, taken March 25, August 31 and September 11, 1903. An indi- 

 vidual was taken just over the line in Leon county, Florida, on March 

 17. 1903, in a very peculiar situation — a distance up a cherry tree. 

 Tridactylus terminalis ScuUder. 



Two individuals of this species were taken at Linton's Pond, near 

 Thomasville, one on March 18, and the other April 10, 1904. The 

 exact locality was a sloping sandy beach constantly dampened by 

 the flow of several springs, situated in an overhanging bank and close 

 to a stream. 



Diligent search revealed two other specimens of this species, but 

 owing to the absence of a net at the time they readily escaped. (M. H.) 



Ellipes minuta (Scudder). 



This species was found in several places in the vicinity of Thomasville 

 and in Leon county. The locations are moist meadow land or sandy 

 beaches, and here this active little species was very numerous. At 

 Linton's Pond it was taken on April 10, and in northern Leon county 

 on March 22. Nine specimens have been examined. 



Cycloptilum squamosum Scudder 7 



A single male specimen is questionably referred to this species. It 

 was taken at Thomasville, August 13, 1903. The condition of the 

 specimen is such that accurate identification is impossible, but the 

 description of squamosum contains nothing radically different from 

 the specimen examined. 

 Nemobiua maculatus Blatchley. 



This species is represented by a scries of fifteen individuals of both 

 sexes, taken at Thomasville. The months represented are June, July, 




800 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



August, September, October, November and December, As is usual 

 with the species of this genus a great amount of variation in size is 

 noticed in the series. 



All the specimens of this species which I took were captured among 

 the weeds of an unused field and in the grass in our yard. The males 

 stridulate continually, and their constant creeee-creee-creee may be 

 heard from every side on a warm day. This species fills the place 

 which is occupied by Nemobius fasciatus in the North. (M. H.) 



Nemobius socius Scudder. 



This striking form is represented by one male and ten female speci- 

 mens, all taken at Thomasville in May, June, July and September. 

 But two of the specimens are brachypterous, the other nine possessing 

 caudate wings. 



These specimens were collected at night about the arc lights, to which 

 they were attracted by the light. (M. H.) 



Nemobius ambitiosus Scudder. 



The beautiful but subdued coloring of the male of this species makes 

 it an easily recognized form, and a series of thirty individuals of both 

 sexes have been examined. They were taken at Thomasville in Febru- 

 ary, March, April, October, November and December. In the spring 

 of 1903 several individuals were taken in Leon count3\ There is some 

 variation in the depth of color in the females, ranging from dull black- 

 ish to blackish brown and umber. 



This beautiful species is ever present, being astir on the coldest 

 winter days. I heard one specimen stridulating in the pine straw on a 

 morning when the mercury had just risen above freezing. The sound 

 produced by the males is quite different from that of any other species, 

 but it would be indeed difficult to describe the pitch which makes it so. 

 (M. H.) 



Nemobius cubensis Saussure. 



This species, which bears quite a superficial resemblance to N. socius, 

 is represented in the collection by five specimens, one male and four 

 females, the male individual being referred here with a little doubt. 

 All the specimens were taken in J\Iay and June, 1903, at Thomasville, 



Nemobius exiguus Blatchley. 



It was with considerable surprise that this species was recognized 

 in the material studied, but a series of forty-seven specimens appear 

 to be perfectly referable to this species, previously known only from 

 Indiana. Thomasville individuals were taken in January, February 

 and December, and one specimen was collected at the Ocklockonee 

 river on March 29. 1904. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 801 



This species was verj' plentiful in certain localities in the pine woods 

 along the branches, where the ground was low and marshy. The series 

 of forty-seven could easily have been doubled. (M. H.) 



Nemobius carolinus Scudder. 



Thirteen specimens, five males and eight females, represent this 

 beautiful species. They were all taken at Thomasville in December 

 on sphagnum. 



All of these specimens were taken at Thomasville during December 

 in beds of sphagnum. The specimens were wary, and when in danger 

 would hide in the sphagnum, from which they could then be easily 

 taken. The bright lacquer color of the head, legs and body of these 

 distinguished them at a glance from all other species. (M. H.) 



Gryllul pennsylvanicus Burmeister. 



Four specimens of this species are contained in the collection, two 

 males and two females, from Thomasville, taken on August 29, 1903. 



Gryllus rubens Scudder. 



This species, which was described from a single female individual 

 from Auburn, Alabama, is represented by a series of sixty specimens, 

 almost equally divided between the sexes. They are all from Thomas- 

 ville, taken in July and August; one immature individual, however, 

 having been taken in March. A great amount of variation is exliibited 

 in the intensity of the color pattern, some individuals having the dull 

 reddish markings on the lateral portions of the pronotum obsolete, 

 and the red on the posterior femora is more extensive in some individu- 

 als than in others. 



Gryllus luctuosus Serville. 



Specimens of this species from Thomasville, taken in ]\Iay and June, 

 1903, have been examined.

This species is represented by a series of one hundred and twenty- 

 two specimens from Thomasville. The months represented are June, 

 vSeptcmber and October. Considerable variation is exhibited in the 

 pattern and intensity of the black markings on the basal joints of the

This interesting species is represented b}' a series of fifteen males, ton 

 females and fom- immature individuals. Tlie months represented are 

 March, April and July. The immature indi\dduals are considerably 

 darker and more wine-colored than the adults, and are longitudinally 

 striped with dark brown which gives them a rather peculiar appearance. 



This species, although restricted to colonies among the wire-grass 

 of the pine woods, may be taken in numbers at the right time of year. 

 Although very active and resembling the wire-grass closely in color, 

 they are easy to capture with the aid of a net. I noticed them to jump 

 from clump to clump of the grass, clinging to the topmost blades. 

 Both sexes are equally agile. (M. H.) 

 Hapithus brevipennis Saussure. 



This species, which was described from Georgia and Louisiana, is 

 represented by three adult males, two adult females and three imma- 

 ture individuals from Thomasville. The months represented are July, 

 August and October. The males have the stripe on the margin of the 

 dorsal field much more richly colored than in the females. 

 Orocharis gryllodes (Pallas). 



This beautiful species is represented b}' a series of four male and seven 

 female specimens, taken at Thomasville in December, 1903. One 

 female individual is uniformly colored as in the males, but the others 

 are sprinkled -uath umber. This species is easily separated from 0. 

 saltator by the broader and subequal pronotum and the greater number 

 of rami of the mediastine vein. 



All of these specimens were taken from under sign boards on oak 

 trees, where they were evidently hibernating. On one occasion several 

 specimens were taken from under the same sign. (M. H.)

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF EARTHWORM (DIPLOCARDIA LONGA) 

 FROM GEORGIA. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Forming part of a small collection of earthworms gathered by Mrs. 

 T. W. "Walker in Pulaski county, Georgia, and secured for the Academy 

 through the interest of Mr. Joseph Willcox, are seven specimens of a 

 hitherto unnoticed species of Diplocardia. Its most distinctive feature 

 is found in the coexistence of the second gizzard and the first pair of 

 spermathecse in the same somite, in which respect it is unique among 

 known species of the genus. In the presence of the gizzards in somites 

 VI and YII it resembles D. michaelseni, but differs from that species 

 in the possession of three pairs of spermathecse. The latter character 

 and numerous others which appear in the following description evi- 

 dently ally it to the communis group, but the great number of segments, 

 high level of the nephridial openings, form of the spermathecse, etc., 

 are diagnostic. 

 Diplocardia longa n. sp. 



Size of D. communis; length in moderate extension up to 275 mm.; 

 diameter at VII 5 mm., behind the clitellum 4 mm. Number of seg- 

 ments 270 to 330. Form slender, terete throughout ; diameter increas- 

 ing to VII, then diminishing to the clitellum which is slightly enlarged 

 and prominent, then narrowing a little and remaining nearly uniform 

 to near the end, where a slight club-shaped enlargement precedes a 

 final shrinkage to the anal ring. 



Frost omium verj^ short, broad and nearly truncate, in most speci- 

 mens scarcely projecting beyond the peristomium into which it is 

 tenoned for about one-half the length of the latter. The exact form, 

 however, differs in the several specimens ; in some the two sides nearly 

 meet within the peristomium ; in others they arc more nearly parallel 

 and may be continued by grooves nearly to the posterior border of the 

 latter, or they may merge into transverse grooves. Both prostomium 

 and peristomium are much marked above with longitudinal wrinkles 

 and the former has a deep ventral furrow. 



The somites increase in length to VII, and then diminish to about 

 one-half in the postclitellial region, after which they change but little 




804 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



till the posterior end is approached. Somites II and III are simple; 

 IV is biannulate, with the furrow just behind the setae and consequently- 

 nearer to the posterior margin; V has a median setigerous annulus 

 partially cut off from the larger annulus. The remaining preclitellial 

 segments are conspicuously triannulate, the middle or setigerous annu- 

 lus being the narrowest but most prominent. Occasionally the first 

 annulus is again subdi^dded into two. When the clitellum is present, 

 as in most of the specimens, the segments of this region are smooth 

 and undi\dded, dorsally at least, but in irmnature worms the annula- 

 tion appears here also. In all but the most posterior of the postclitellial 

 somites also the triannular structure is apparent, but is generally in- 

 conspicuous except in the more anterior ones or those strongly con- 

 tracted. 



The usual four pairs of setae are present on all somites except the 

 peristomium, a few preanal, and XIX, the latter of which lacks the 

 ventral pairs only. All are strictly paired and strongly ventral in 

 position, but the intervening spaces vary somewhat. On XVI the 

 setal formula is a-b < \ a-a, a-a = 2\ c-d, a-h = f c-d, b-c < a-a, d-d = 

 about f semi-circumference. Ordinary setae stout, sigmoid, blunt- 

 pointed, thickened distad of middle, the outer end slightly sculptured 

 with a reticulum of fine lines giving to the setae an appearance of being 

 covered with delicate scales. Spermathecal copulatory setae (the 

 ventral ones on VII, VIII and IX) similar but with much bolder sculp- 

 turing and apparently unaccompanied by special glands. Penial setae 

 (the ventral ones on XVIII and XX) capillary, tapering, somewhat 

 thickened within the body-walls, with slight sinuous curvatures, 

 especially near the end, which may be slightly hooked. They are 

 about twice as long, or somewhat more, than the ordinary setae, and 

 only I to i as thick. Near the end is a sculptured region marked with 

 close transverse lines appearing as fine notches on the profiles, but the 

 end itself for a considerable distance is smooth or longitudinally 

 striated. 



Dorsal pores begin at ^ or usuall}^ ^j and are conspicuous. The 

 position of the nephridiopores is remarkable in being widely removed 

 from the dorsalmost seta; while the former are situated at approxi- 

 mately the two ends of the transverse diameter of the body the latter 

 are fully 15° to 30° below these points. Successive nephridiopores 

 are usually alternately at a little higher and lower level and are on the 

 extreme anterior borders of the somites — almost in the furrows — the 

 first on III. Spermathecal pores are less easily found. They occur 

 in line with seta a on the anterior part of somites VII, VIII and IX, 

 and are consequently prcsetal and postseptal. 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. SOo 



Though present in all but one, the clitellum is perfectly developed 

 only in the largest specunen. It covers seven segments, XIII to XIX 

 inclusive, and is completely annular and of uniform thickness on the 

 first five, but interrupted or much thinner on the middle ^•entral region 

 of the last two. On the posterior clitellial and several of the immedi- 

 ately succeeding segments occur certain papillse and grooves utilized 

 during copulation. Two pairs of papillte, situated on the posterior 

 part of XVII or on ^yyjf and on the posterior part of XX or ^^i ' ^^'^ 

 constant on all of the specimens; a third pair situated on XXI or ^j^j 

 is complete in one specimen, represented by a median papilla in one, 

 by the left only in three specimens, by the right only in one. and is 

 totally absent in the seventh, in which, however, indistinct thickened 

 areas appear in the median field of ^^^^^ and -^^^. In one specimen a 

 small median papilla is present on XVII between those of the pair. 

 WTien the papillae overlap the contiguous borders of two segments, 

 which is the normal condition, the affected furrows are obliterated 

 ventrally. In most cases the first pan of papillae are much the largest 

 and the third the smallest, but in this respect also they are variable. 

 All of the papillae are low, broad disks of an irregular elliptical or some- 

 times circular form. The central portion is more translucent and 

 either elevated or depressed above the more opaque, firmer rim which 

 contains a circle of glands. The entire structure of these papillae 

 indicates that in addition to a secretory adhesive function of the rim 

 the center acts as a true vacuum sucker. Just anterior and posterior 

 to each pair of suckers transverse grooves usually extend across the 

 venter and other shorter and less constant ones may occur. A'ery con- 

 stant and conspicuous are a pair of longitudinal grooves reaching in the 

 line of the ventral setae from the middle of X^TII to the middle of XX. 

 Each groove consists of three parts: a short anterior section reaching 

 from the setae of XVIII to the furrow ^x^x^' ^ longer middle section 

 extending for the entire length of XIX, and a short posterior section 

 completing the groove to the setae of XX. All three sections are 

 strongly curved, the anterior and posterior with the convexity outward, 

 the middle with the convexity directed inward. At the point of junc- 

 tion of the anterior and middle sections, in the furrow -^j^ ' ^^^ groove 

 enlarges into a small triangular sinus containing a minute papilla upon 

 which the male pore opens. This is perhaps situated rather more on 

 XIX than XVIII. At each end of the groove and just external to the 

 closely approximated penial setae of somites XVHI and XX are the 

 external openings of the two pairs of prostate glands, the secretion of 

 which is therefore brought to the sperm by means of this groove. The 




806 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



female pores are situated close together between the ventral setse of 

 XIV, but a'-e invisible in surface \'iews. 



* No complete coelomic septa exist anterior to ^?j , this space being 

 largely occupied by the radiating pharyngeal muscles; ^^^ is slightly 

 thickened, ^^^ and ^n about twice as thick, and ^^^^ to ^ each about 

 four times as thick as ordinary septa and extremely muscular. From 

 ^ to ^j^ the septa are strongly funnel-shaped and "nested." The 

 pharynx occupies III and IV, a short oesophagus Y, the strongly mus- 

 cular gizzards VI and VII ; then follows a straight narrow canal which 

 appears to lack calciferous pouches, but is slightly enlarged with yel- 

 lowish, thickened and very vascular walls in the posterior part of X 

 and presents a similar but less pronounced structure in XI. The true 

 sacculated intestine begins in XVIII. The anus Ls a wide vertical 

 slit. The brain is transverse, about five times as wide as long, without 

 median constriction or any lobing, and is situated in II. The ventral 

 cord is remarkable for the complete and extremely thick muscular 

 sheath, which equals ^ the diameter of the cord proper at a ganglionic 

 enlargement. Although present in other species of Diplocardia, the 

 muscular sheath is in this one thicker than usual. Apparently there 

 are no peculiarities of the vascular system. Unlike the type species 

 the dorsal vessel is single and undi\'ided throughout in the three exam- 

 ples dissected. Strongly enlarged hearts occur in XIII, and a slightly 

 enlarged pair in XII. The nephridia begin in III, and appear to be 

 present in every succeeding somite. Except for the first five pairs, 

 which are more compactly coiled and of smaller size, the}' have the 

 long-looped form described for other species of the genus. 



Three pairs of spermathecse exist in the anterior parts of somites 

 VII, VIII and IX, attached to th^ body floor at the base of the corre- 

 sponding septa, behind which they rise freely to a high level, though 

 occasionally they pass through the neural arch of the 

 septum nto the preceding somite. All of the sperma- 

 thecse have the pouch and stalk very distinctly differ- 

 entiated and are especially characterized by the great 

 length of the latter and the very low position of the 

 diverticulum which arises from its lateral s'de at the 

 point at which it enters the body wall. The pouch 

 has in general the form shown in fig. 1, which represents 

 the second spermatheca, and in all of the specimens 

 examined is strongly flattened latera ly. The stalk is 

 Y\„_ I at least as long as and usually longer than the pouch, 



and also more or less flattened by the pressure of the 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 807 



neighboring organs. The flat, spreading diverticulum opens into the 

 base of the stalk by a short, narrow duct. In three specimens dis- 

 sected the pouch increases in size successively from the first to the 

 third spermatheca and the diverticulum diminishes correspondingly. 

 While completely divided into two or even three lobes in the first, 

 the latter is in the second and third cither simple or very faintly 

 bilobcd. 



The testes occupy the usual position in somites X and XI, and two 

 pairs of sperm sacs are borne on the anterior face of septum ^ and 

 the posterior face of septum ^. The latter are much and deeply 

 lobulated, having the aspect of dense tufts of broadly clavate or stalked 

 spheroidal bodies. The sperm funnels lie in somites X and XI attached 

 to the posterior septa near the coelomic floor and close to the ventral 

 nerve cord. They are of simple form and consist chiefly of a pair of 

 broad lobes partly folded together like the two lobes of a Dioncea leaf. 

 After penetrating the septa the vasa deferentia plunge at once into the 

 longitudinal muscular layer of the body wall which they penetrate 

 to a depth of about | of its thickness, and continue at this level in 

 the line of the ventral setse to a point near the male gonopore, when 

 they bend sharply outward toward the surface. Throughout their 

 course the two vasa deferentia of each side lie side by side, but arc 

 perfectly distinct until quite at the external orifice, where they coalesce 

 at a common opening. The ovaries are conspicuous, fimbriated, fan- 

 shaped structures consisting of niunerous 

 chains of ova attached to the posterior face 

 of septum -xiir Trumpet-shaped oviducts, 

 the mouths of which are formed very much 

 like the sperm funnels, perfoiate the septiun 

 xiV' ^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ penetrate the body floor 

 obliquely backward and inward. Near the 

 external surface they bend sharply toward 

 the median line and open in the setse zone on 

 the ventral surface of XIV, separated by an 

 interval of about \ a-a or less than the 

 transverse diameter of the nerve cord with 

 its sheath. The external pores are so 

 small that they can be detected only ;n sec- 

 tions. The prostate glands (fig. 2) are large 

 and conspicuous, and are variously folded 

 sharply back and forth several times within 

 the limits of the single segments XMII 




808 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



and XX which the two pairs respectively occupy. The glandular- 

 portion and the muscular duct are sharply differentiated, and the 

 latter arises directly from the end of the former. The former is 

 about three times as thick and three and one-half times as long as 

 the latter, cylindrical and tubular, with a distinct lumen throughout 

 and thick walls composed of gland cells in various stages of activity. 

 The integuments are translucent and the colors dull in Hfe. The 

 anterior and usually the extreme posterior ends are hair brown, varying 

 in shade ; the clitellum is russet, and the remainder of the body nearly 

 salmon pink or sometimes ecru. Through the less pigmented portions 

 of the skin the blood vessels show conspicuously of a deep purple color. 

 These worms are very sluggish, but may be stimulated to greater ac- 

 tivity by exposure to light, which they seek to avoid. They occur 

 in moi-t sandy soil.

NEW CLAUSILIID^ OF THE JAPANESE EMPIRE— X. 

 BY HEXRY A. PILSBRY. 



In this tenth^ article upon Japanese Clausiliidce, the species discov- 

 ered by J\Ir. Nakada in the Ryukyu Islands and by Mr. Azuma in 

 Satsiima and its islands, are dealt with, together with a few forms from 

 other parts of the empire. The two collectors mentioned, working 

 under Mr. Hirase's direction, have about doubled the number of land 

 mollusks known from the Ryukyu Islands. Tokunoshima has proved 

 particularly rich. The transition from the Ryukyuan fauna to that 

 of Japan proper is found :'n Yakujima and Tanegashima, Osumi, and 

 in the Koshikijima group, south of Satsuma. In these islands there 

 is a strong Ryukyuan strain, but the Kyushu faunal element predomi- 

 nates. 



In the Ryukyu group the Clausiliidce are present in abundance. 

 Except Stereophcedusa , none of the Japanese groups are represented, 

 the species I formerly referred to Hemiphcsdusa being so far specialized 

 that they may more properly be segregated as separate groups. Luchu- 

 phcedusa and the Zaptychoid forms predominate. Some of them are 

 wonderfully specialized, Diceratoptyx, for instance, has almost lost 

 the lunella, which remains as a minute vestige only ; the lower palatal 

 plica has been crowded upward, and its place taken by the dilated 

 subcolumellar lamella. Oligozaptyx and some Luchuphadusas are 

 almost equally modified in other directions. As a whole, the Clau- 

 siliidce are more specialized than those of either China or Japan, 

 and bear out the proposition I have elsewhere advanced, that insular 

 faunas age more rapidly than those of larger or continental areas.

This rib-striate little Megalophcedusa is related to C. hiraseana. It 

 differs in being much smaller, light colored, not quite so coarsely 

 sculptured, with emerging subcolumellar lamella. C. nagashimana 

 of the neighboring province Satsuma is more closely related, but that is 

 also a large dark form. Both of these species differ widely from 

 C. cymatodes in the shape of the clausilium, which in cymatodes is very 

 obtuse at the distal end. The number of palatal plicae will probably 

 prove to be variable.

 though it does not reach the lip-edge. 



Another specimen, evidently from a more moist locality, is eroded, 

 dull whitish, partially overgrown with green algse. The subcolumellar 

 lamella is immersed, and the superior lamella is separated from the 

 spiral. The clausilium is like that of C. hiraseana. Without a larger 

 series of specmiens it is impossible to tell whether this represents 

 another race or not.

 the striae a little closer on the back of the last whorl. Whorls 9^ or 

 10, the first one globose, sometimes self-amputated. The attenuated 

 early whorls are very convex, the later ones less so, and the last whorl 

 is somewhat flattened laterally, \^^[th a noticeable impression marking 

 the position of the principal plica. The aperture is trapezoidal-ovate, 

 somewhat oblique, the peristome reflexed, slightly thickened, con- 

 tinuous and well raised across the parietal wall. The superior lamella 

 is small, marginal and oblique, continuous with the spiral lamella, 

 which is very high within and penetrates across the ventral side. The 

 inferior lamella recedes deeply, and within the back ascends obliquely, 

 and is nearly straight. It is far smaller and lower than the spiral 

 lamella, but penetrates as deeply. The subcolumellar lamella emerges 

 to the lip-edge. The principal plica is very long, reaching nearly to

812 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. 



In this HemiphcBdusa of the group of C. aulacophora the pUcse and 

 lamellae penetrate very deeply — across the ventral side — and the 

 lunella stands in a ventral position, above the columellar margin of the 

 peristome. In C. aulacophora and C. pigra the lunella is lateral, but 

 of the same shape. C. ventriluna is very closely related to C. cary- 

 ostoma and C. c. jayi, which have the armature similarly deep-seated ; 

 but neither of these forms has a perfect lunella uniting the two palatal 

 pHcse. 



The clausilium is not thickened distally as in Tyrannophcedusa, but 

 otherwise C. ventriluna has much in common with C. {Tyr.) aurantiaca. 



Other specimens from Tsushima, Awa (Shikoku), are smaller than 

 those from Yasuda-mura, and the superior lamella is either separated 

 from the spiral lamella or but weakly connected therewith. The prin- 

 cipal plica is a little shorter inside. In some of the specimens the sub- 

 columellar lamella emerges to the lip-edge, and is bounded by furrows. 

 In others it is immersed or very feebly and slightly emerges. These 

 shells are No. 1,187 of Mr. Hirase's collection.

 the last somewhat flattened peripherally. Aperture rhombic-ovate, 

 somewhat oblique, the peristome continuous, reflexed and somewhat 

 thickened within; the parietal margin weU raised, straight or a little 

 emarginate over the superior lameUa. Superior lamella slightly 

 oblique, compressed, marginal, continuous with the spiral lamella, 

 which extends inward scarcely to the middle of the ventral side. 

 Inferior lamella deeply receding, straightly ascending within the back, 

 not penetrating quite so deeply as the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar 

 lamella very weakly emerging. Principal plica not long, dorsal and

Clausilia hosayaka n. sp. PI. LV, figs. 61, 62, 63. 



Shell slender, regularly tapering from the penultimate whorl, the 

 upper third attenuate, apex obtuse ; thin but moderately strong, light 

 brown. Surface glossy, very finely striate. Whorls about 13^, mod- 

 erately convex, the last somewhat flattened on the back. Aperture 

 small, oblique, squarish-piriform, the peristome reflexed, somewhat 

 thickened within, continuous, the parietal margin shortly raised, and 

 emarginate above the superior lamella. Superior lamella compressed, 

 only slightly oblique, continuous with the spiral lamella, which pene- 

 trates to the middle of the ventral side. Inferior lamella receding, visi- 

 ble in the aperture as a small fold, straightly ascending within the back, 

 penetrating a little further inward than the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar 

 lamella either emerging to the lip-edge or immersed. Principal plica 

 short, chiefly dorsal. Upper palatal plica short, oblique, not connected 

 with the very weak lateral lunella, which is obsolete below, and curves 

 inward above or coimects with a short, weak second palatal plica. 

 There is no lower palatal plica.

By its palatal armature this species belongs to the Hemiphaedusan 

 group of C. sublunellata. It is readily distinguished from other known 

 species of that group by the greater number of whorls and more slender 

 spire. The lunella is very feebly developed, and probably will be 

 found to be sometimes obsolete, as in some other species of the group.

Shell fusiform, much attenuated above, very solid and strong; pale 

 yellow, somewhat glossy, closely and finely striate. Whorls 9, the first 

 quite small, the rest convex, the last whorl somewhat flattened. The 

 aperture is ovate and projects shortly free; peristome white, reflexed 

 and thickened within. The superior lamella is marginal, low and 

 oblique, continuous with the spiral lamella, which penetrates to a 

 point above the sinulus. The inferior lamella recedes deeply, is straight 

 and oblique within, and thickened at the lower end. It does not pene-

trate quite so far as the spiral lamella. The subcolumcllar lamella is 

 deeply immersed. The principal plica is dorsal and lateral, approach- 

 ing the lip. There is an oblique series of about 5 small, slender jialatal

I formerly included the species of this section in Hemiphcedusa, from 

 which they differ totally in the form of the clausilium, and in the spir- 

 ally ascending inferior lamella. C. excellens, of which the clausilium

 to IjuchuphcBdusa. The other species are closely related. 

 Clausilia okinoerabuensis n. sp. PI. LII, figs. 13, 14. 



Shell subcylindric below, the upper half tapering and somewhat

 strongly striate, the striation coarser on the back of the last whorl. 

 Whorls 10, the upper 3 smooth. Aperture ovate-piriform, the perLs-

 the superior lamella, and very indistinct traces of crenulation near it. 

 Superior lamella marginal, small, subvertical, continuous with the 

 spiral lamella which penetrates to the left side. Inferior lamella form-

 finely striate, the last whorl becoming coarsely striate behind. Aper- 

 ture broadly piriform, white. Peristome with the outer and basal 

 margins well reflexed and thickened within; columellar and parietal 

 margins beautifully crenulate. Superior lamella marginal, compressed , 

 continuous with the spiral lamella, which penetrates past the aperture 

 to the left side. Inferior lamella forming a rather small, subhorizontal 

 fold in the aperture, with an accessory fold below it extending to the 

 margin; as long inside as the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar lamella 

 emerging to the lip-edge, decidedly shorter inside than the other lamella. 

 The principal plica is long, visible in the throat, extending across the 

 ventral side. The upper palatal plica is very oblique. Lower palatal 

 pHca long and angularly bent, a very oblique and rather long lunella 

 arising from the angle. It lies in a sub ventral position.

This fine species is related to C. callistochila, from which it differs in 

 the following peculiarities: The striation is finer; the inferior lamella is 

 more distinctly doubled below ; the lunella is longer and more ventral 

 in position, and the clausilium has a larger process at the apex. It is 

 also related to C. una Pils., of Goto, Hizen; but in that species the 

 lunella is shorter and lateral, and the clausilium is much less specialized, 

 being much like that of Stereophcedusa. 



C. aziimai is one of the finest species collected this j'-car by Mr. Azuma 

 in the islands of Satsuma. 



Clausilia una, which I formerly placed in Stcreophadusa, should 

 probably be transferred to Luchuphcedusa or to a separate and special 

 section allied to Luchuphcedusa, characterized by the unspecialized 

 clausilium, while all other structures are Luchupha;dusoid. 

 C. azumai idiopylis n. subsp. PI. LII, fig. 8. 



Somewhat smaller than C. azumai and dull reddish-brown; inner 

 lip less strongly crenate; inferior lamella thickened but not distinctly

Clausilia nakadai n. sp. PI. LII, figs. 9. 10, 11. 



Shell fusiform, moderately attenuate above ; yellow, the worn early 

 whorls whitish, nearly lustcrless, finely striate. Whorls 10, convex, the 

 latter half of the last flattened. Aperture piriform, white within, with 

 distinct, slightly retracted sinulus. Peristome broadly reflexcd, with 

 a fold or doubling behind, thickened within. Columellar and parietal 

 margins crenulaied. The superior lamella is compressed, vertical and 

 marginal, and continuous with the spiral lamella, which is very high, 

 and penetrates past the ventral side to the middle of the left side. 

 The inferior lamella projects as a very strong columellar fold in the 

 aperture, and penetrates inward slightly farther than the spiral lamella. 

 The subcolumellar lamella emerges to the lip-edge, and penetrates as 

 deeply as the spiral lamella. The 'principal plica extends nearly to the 

 lip, and enters deeply. There is a rather long, oblique upper palatal 

 plica, and an obliquely ascending and entering lunella arising from 

 the summit of a long, angularly bent lower palatal plica ; all Ijang in a 

 nearly ventral position. The lower end of the lower palatal plica is 

 visible in the aperture in an oblique view.

C. nakadai is intermediate between C. caUistochila and C. oshimoe in 

 size, geographic position and morphology. The aperture resembles 

 that of oshimce in shape, but is wider, and the right lip is more crenu- 

 lated. The lamellEe are not quite so long as in oshimce. The lunella 

 is better developed than in either of the other species, .and the lower 

 palatal plica is far shorter than in C. oshimoe, but differs from that of 

 caUistochila in shape. 



This handsome Luchuphoedusa is named in honor of Mr. Nakada, 

 who has brought to light more Riukiuan land snails than all other

 closely and finely crenulate (the crenulation sometimes subobsolete). 

 Superior lamella marginal, rather small, continuous with the spiral 

 lamella, which penetrates to the middle of the left side. Inferior 

 lamella forming a prominent columellar fold, more or less distinctly

The clausilium is well curved, spatulatc, with a thick rib near the 

 columellar side of the distal half, continued and ^projecting finger-like at 

 the apex; proximally it tapers into the filament, and is not emarginate. 



The shell is short, oblong, of few whorls (6-6^ in the species known), 

 the summit very obtuse, entire. Superior continuous with the spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella stronghj spiral within, bifid below. Upper 

 and lower palatal plicae long, the latter united with an oblique lunella. 



The only species now known has a crenulate lip, like Luchuphcedusa, 

 and the palatal armature and clausilium are similar in the two groups ; 

 but in Luchuphcedusa the shell is shaped like ordinary Clausilias, while 

 in Oophcedusa the thick-set shell is not in the least attenuate above,

 which also emerges to the lip-edge. Subcolumellar lamella emerging. 

 Principal plica extending from the middle of the dorsal side to a point 

 above the sinulus, visible through from the outside. Upper palatal

 convex, the first 3 or 4 cylindric, the penultimate whorl swollen as seen 

 dorsally, last whorl flattened, convex below, not noticeably different 

 in sculpture. Aperture ovate, subvertical, the peristome white, 

 re flexed and thickened within, continuous in a slightly raised ledge 

 across the parietal wall, a little sinuous or notched at the position of the 

 superior lamella. Superior lamella decidedly oblique, marginal, con- 

 tinuous within with the spiral lamella, which penetrates inward to the 

 middle of the ventral side. Inferior lamella appearing in front as a 

 strong, subhorizontal fold crossing a much more oblique callous colu- 

 mellar fold which continues weakly upon the lip; the whole appearing 

 as two nodules. Within the back the inferior lamella is strongly 

 spiral but not very high. It penetrates inward more deeply than the 

 superior lamella. The subcolumellar lamella emerges to the lip-edge. 

 The principal plica is very short and lateral. Palatal plicoe 4, strong, 

 somewhat oblique and parallel, the lower one a little arcuate, the two 

 intermediate plicae shorter than the others.

The broadly truncate summit and robust stature distinguish this 

 from C. hickonis. C. fulioni Sykes, which is merely a weakly charac- 

 terized variety of C. vasta Bttg., differs by its more straightly ascending 

 inferior lamella as well as by the entire apex. 



Zaptychoid phylum. 



The material brought together by Mr. Hirase's collector in the islands 

 of the Ryukyu curve this year, enlarge our knowledge of this phylum 

 to such a degree that a revision of the group is required. 



The entire series of Zaptychoid Clausiliae consists of small, often 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 823 



very small, species, few-whorlcd, with a clausilium very deeply excised 

 on the coliiniellar side of the filament, and abruptly bent and twisted 

 there. The closing apparatus is always lateral or dorso-lateral, the 

 lamellae rarely penetrate as far as the middle of the ventral side, and 

 the spiral lamella is usually low. 



The sections Oligozaptyx and Diceratoptyx constitute two new second- 

 ary phyla, independently evolved from the typical group. In both 

 the clausiliiun is notched, and the whole structure shows great speciali- 

 zation. Another line of differentiation is represented by the sections 

 Metazaptyx and Parazaptyx, in which the inferior lamella has become 

 spiral, thereby obstructing the throat, and the clausilium is strongly 

 curved. In Parazaptyx the clausilium is further modified in a peculiar 

 and unexampled manner. Then we come to a series of groups in which 

 the shell is without accessory plicae and lamellae, and now defined as 

 Hemizaptyx and Stereozaptyx. The species of these groups I had 

 formerly appended to various sectional divisions as aberrant forms. 

 The evidence now at hand indicates that they are either degenerate 

 or primitive branches of the Zaptyx phylum. Stereozaptyx may 

 well be a secondarily simplified form of Parazaptyx, in which the 

 accessory plicae and lamellae have been obliterated in the general and 

 extreme thickening of the shell walls. If so, immature shells might 

 possibly still show some trace of them. 



The interrelations of the subordinate groups and their approximate 

 phylogeny, so far as I understand the recent and fossil forms now 

 known, may be represented by the following diagram. The names of 

 those groups of which the position is hypothetical are in italics.

 half of the clausilium flat. Oshima, . . . . C. munus. 



Clausilia purissima n. sp. PI. LV, figs. 47. 48, 49. 



Shell slenderly fusiform, rather thin, transparent, with a greenish 

 tint, the surface polished, with a brilliant gloss, faintly marked with 

 slight growth-wrinkles. Spire regularly tapering to the obtuse apex, 

 the lateral outlines nearly straight. Whorls 10, convex, parted by a 

 wTll-marked suture, the last whorl a little compressed laterally. Aper- 

 ture oval, the peristome slightly expanded, a little thickened, continu- 

 ous, the parietal margin barely free, short and straightened. Superior 

 lamella marginal, rather high and thin, oblique, continuous with the 

 spiral lamella, which penetrates about to the middle of the ventral 

 side. Inferior lamella hardly visible in a front view, receding, 

 straightly ascending, shorter within than the superior lamella. Sub- 

 columellar lamella very deeply immersed, penetrating inward about 

 as far as the inferior lamella. Principal plica short, dorso-lateral, 

 visible in the throat, penetrating slightly past a lateral position. 

 Upper palatal plica short, dorso-lateral. Lunella oblique, straight, 

 strongly curving inward at the lower end, not quite reaching the upper 

 palatal plica. 



Length 12.3 to 12.8, diam. 2.3 mm. 



Clausilium (fig. 47) parallel-sided, the apex rounded; abruptly and 

 deeply excised on the columellar side of the filament. 



Miyakejima, Izu. Types No. 85,731, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,089 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



In this exquisite species the shell is so pellucid that the plicse, lamellae 

 and axis may be seen through. It is not closely related to any known 

 species, but seems to belong to a group characteristic of the islands 

 south of Kyushu. It is with some doubt, however, that I place C. 

 purissima in the group Hcmizaptyx. It may belong to Hemiphadusa. 



Clausilia asperata n. sp. PL LV, figs. 42, 43, 44. 



Shell fusiform, the spire noticeably attenuated above, moderately 

 strong, grayish-brown; glossy; very finely striate, the back of the last 

 whorl sculptured with narrow, widely spaced riblets. Whorls 8^ to 9^, 

 convex, the last tapering. Aperture ovate, the peristome thin, ex- 

 panded and reflexed, shortly free and projecting above. Superior 

 lamella small, marginal, continuous with the spiral lamella, which is 

 rather high within, and penetrates nearly to the middle of the ventral 

 side. Inferior lamella deeply receding, not visible from in front; 

 inside it is nearly straight, thickened and quite high; penetrating a 

 little less deeply than the spiral lamella. The subcolumellar lamella 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 827 



is wholly immersed. Principal plica short. The upper palatal plica 

 is extremely short, a mere enlargement of the summit of the narrow 

 lunella, which is straight above, curved inward below. 



Length 11.2, diam. 2.3 mm.; whorls 9^ (figs. 43, 44). 



Length 9, diam. 2 mm.; whorls 8^ (fig. 42). 



The clausilium is parallel-sided, nearly straight, rounded at the apex, 

 excised on the columellar side of the filament. The palatal margin 

 is recurved and dilated. 



Shimo-Koshikijima, Satsuma. Types No. 87,606, A. N. S. P., from 

 No. 1,242 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is the only Zaptychoid form yet known from the Koshi- 

 kijima group. It is related to C. -pinto from Tanegashima, but differs 

 in the anteriorly projecting aperture, thinner lip, less solid shell, 

 immersed subcolumellar lamella and the somewhat differently shaped 

 clausilium. Moreover, the back of the last whorl is sculptured with 

 spaced riblets, while the rest of the shell has very close, delicate strise, 

 becoming imperceptible above the middle of the shell. The largest 

 specimen (figs. 43, 44) is extensively worn, and therefore figured in 

 outline. The sculpture is well shown in fig. 42. 

 Clausilia hyperaptyx n. sp. PI. LVI, figs. 85, 86, 87, 88. 



The shell is fusiform, glossy, dark reddish-brown, weakly, finely 

 striate, the back of the last whorl densely and sharply striate. Upper 

 half of the spire rapidly tapering to a rather acute apex. Wliorls 7^. 

 Apertm-e like that of C. hyperoptyx, but the peristome is somewhat 

 more widely expanded. Superior lamella continuous with the spiral 

 lamella, which penetrates to the middle of the ventral side, and is 

 much dilated within. There is no fulcrum or parallel lamella. The 

 inferior lamella recedes deeply, is high, strong and nearly straight 

 within the last whorl, and penetrates nearly as deeply as the spiral 

 lamella. The subcolumellar lamella emerges. The principal plica is 

 a half whorl long, dorsal and lateral. The upper palatal plica is short, 

 and lies mainly inward from the upper end of the lunella, with which 

 it is scarcely connected. The lunella is slightly arcuate. There are 

 no sutural plicce. 



Length 10.9, diam. 2.3 mm. 



Length 10, diam. 2 mm. 



Clausilium (PI. LVI, figs. 85, 87, 88) rather long, parallel-sided, the 

 two sides very strongly recurved (see fig. 85), the columellar side is 

 narrowly thickened; the distal end is somewhat acuminate.

This species closely resembles C. hyperoptyx in color and sciilpturc, 

 but is somewhat more obese, with more acute apex, and it is quite 

 different in internal structure and in the shape of the clausilium. It 

 is not closely related to any other species now known. 



The clausilium resembles that of C. munus in shape, except that in 

 munus it is fiat, not rolled back on the two sides. 



Section ZAPTYX Pilsbry, s.str. 

 Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1900, p. 672. 



To the definition of this group may be added : Inferior lamella but 

 slightly curved and obliquely ascending within the last whorl; superior 

 and spiral lamellae sometimes continuous; end of the clausilium 

 rounded. 



The following species belong to this group : 



C. hirasei Pils. Kagoshima and Sakm-a Island, Satsuma. 



C. kikaiensis Pils. Kikaiga-shima, of the Oshima group. 



C. sarissa Pils. Okinoerabu-shima, of the Oshima group. 



C. hyperoptyx Pils. Ryukyu. 



C. hyperoptyx yoronfimana Pils. Yoronjima. 



C. yaeyamensis Pils. Yaeyama. 



It is likely that C. strictaluna Bttg., of Kyushu, a species I have not 

 seen, will prove to belong to Zaptyx; but the clausilium Ls still unknown. 



Clausilia hirasei Pils. PI. LVI, figs. 64, 65, 66. 67. 

 Acad. Xat. Sci. Phila., 1900, pp. 446, 673. 



The original figure was in outline, and new ones are now given for 

 comparison with the other species herein described. 



The clausilium (figs. 66, 67) is more dilated on the palatal side of 

 the filament than in C. hyperoptyx, C. sarissa, or other related species. 



The types were from Kagoshima, Satsuma. The specimens now- 

 illustrated are from Sakura Island, in Kagoshima Bay. It is not 

 known from any other localities.

piriform, the peristome very narrowly reflexed, whitish. Superior 

 lamella small and low, widely separated from the low short spiral 

 lamella. Inferior lamella receding, not visible in a front view; low and 

 obliquely ascending within. Subcolumellar lamella emerging, very 

 slender, rising angularly on the palatal wall below the lunella. A short 

 fulcrum and parallel lamella are present. Principal plica dorsal and 

 lateral, visible in the aperture. Upper palatal plica extremely short, 

 weakly connected with the lunella, which is straight above, but curves 

 inward slightly at the lower end. There are three short sutural plicae, 

 the middle one often inconspicuous. 



Length 9, diam. 2.1 mm. 



Length 7.2, diam. 1.7 to 2 mm. 



Clausilium (PL LVI, figs. 68, 69) rather long, parallel-sided, rounded 

 at the apex, deeply excised at the columellar side of the filament. 



Kikaiga-shima. Osumi. Types Nos. 79,728 and 80,787, A. N. S. P., 

 from Nos. 557 and 5576 of ^Ir. Hirase's collection. It has also been 

 found by ^Ir. Nakada at Tokuno-shima, Osumi (No. 1,203 of Mr. 

 Hirase's collection). It will probably turn up on the intermediate . 

 islands of the Oshima subgroup. 



This species is closely related to C. hyperoptyx of Ryukyu (Okinawa), 

 but it differs in the less swollen embryonic whorls, shorter upper palatal 

 phca, less developed superior lamella and usually smaller size, though 

 the largest specimens of kikaiensis are equal to hyperoptyx. C. hirasei, 

 from Satsuma, along Kagoshima Bay, is a decidedly wider shell, with 

 less attenuated spire. The clausilium in C. kikaiensis resembles that 

 of C. hirasei and C. sarissa, but it is decidedly less dilated on the palatal 

 side of the filament than in C. hirasei. 



I formerly considered the Ivikai specimens to be a \aricty of C. 

 hirasei (these Proceedings for 1901, p. 465), but further study of much 

 larger series of both forms shows that their differential features are 

 constant. They are rather widely separated geographically. 



Clausilia sarissa n. sp. PI. LVI, figs. 72, 73, 74, 75. 



Shell cylindric below, tapering and a little attenuated above ; brown, 

 the fully adult shells marked with whitish or creamy lines and streaks. 

 Surface somewhat glossy, very faintly striatulate, nearly smooth, the 

 last third of the last whorl sharply, finely striate. Whorls 8, quite 

 convex. Aperture ovate, the peristome narrow, reflexed, and in fully 

 adult shells somewhat thickened at the edge. Superior lamella small, 

 vertical, not continuoas with the low small spiral lamella. Inferior 

 lamella receding, visible only in an oblique view in the aperture, high

and a little curved within, not continued parallel to the spiral lamella, 

 but a very small inserted lamella {I. inserta) appears near the end of 

 the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar lamella wholly immersed. There 

 is a fulcrum and a parallel lamella. Principal plica short, dorsal 

 and lateral, visible in the mouth. Upper palatal plica short, joined 

 in the middle to the long lunella, which is straight above, curved in- 

 ward below. A single sutural plica is developed, with the trace of a 

 second upper one. 



Length 10, diam. 2.2 mm. 



Length 9, diam. 2.3 mm. 



Clausilium (PI. LVI, figs. 72, 73) parallel-sided, rounded at the apex, 

 deeply excised on the columellar side of the filament. 



Okinoerabushima, Osumi. Types No. 87,613, A. N. S. P., from No. 

 1,253 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species resembles C. hirasei, but differs in the decidedly stronger 

 strjation of the last whorl behind the lip, the wider peristome, immersed 

 subcolumellar lamella, the more convex whorls and the poorer develop- 

 ment of sutural plicae. It is nearly opaque. As in C. hirasei, the 

 inferior lamella is interrupted within. The palatal side of the filament 

 is less dilated above than in C. hirasei. The specimen figured has a 

 thicker peristome than most of those sent. The figure is too distinctly 

 streaked. 

 Clausilia hyperoptyx Pilsbry. PI. LVI, figs. 76, 77, 78, 79. 



Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1900, pp. 446, 472; 1901, pp. 423. 



The statement in the original description that the "upper palatal 

 plica is veiy short" was an error, which the figure (PI. 14, fig. 12) 

 corrects. The upper palatal plica is rather long, united in the middle 

 with the lunella. The superior lamella is higher, better developed than 

 in C. hirasei and C. kikaiensis. The tapering spire is distinctly attenu- 

 ated above, but the apex is larger than in the related species; and the 

 striation is better developed than in C. hirasei or C. kikaiensis. It is 

 known only from Great Ryukyu Island (Okinawa); the specimens 

 reported from Yaeyama prove to be specifically different. 



Length 9 to 10, diam. 2 mm. 



The clausilium (PI. LVI, figs. 76, 77) is rather wide, rounded distally. 

 It is wider than that of hirasei, kikaiensis or sarissa. 



Clansilia hyperoptyx yoronjimana n. subsp. 



The superior and spiral lamellae are more or less completely discon- 

 nected, and the lunella joins the middle of the short upper palatal plica, 

 as in C. hyperoptTjx; but the shell is perceptibly wider, and the last

 transparent.

Clausilia yaeyamensis n. sp. PI. LVI, figs. 80, 81, 82. 83. 84. 



Shell cylindric below, regularly tapering from the penultimate 

 whorl to the apex; dark chestnut, paler near the apex. Surface glossy, 

 evenly, finely and sharply striate, the back of the last whorl a little more 

 irregularly so. Wliorls 8^, the earlier ones quite convex, the later 

 much less so. Aperture piriform, the peristome expanded, whitish. 

 Superior lamella rather high, compressed, weakly continuous with the 

 spiral lamella, which penetrates nearly to the middle of the ventral 

 side. Inferior lamella deeply receding, nearly straight and obliquely 

 ascending within, shorter than the spiral lamella. Subcolumellar 

 lamella emerging. A parallel lamella and fulcrum present. Principal 

 plica about one-half a whorl long, dorsal and lateral, visible in the 

 aperture. Upper palatal plica very shoi't, connected with the straight 

 lunella, which bends inward at its lower end. There are two sutural 

 plicae.

Yaeyama, Ryukyu. Types No. 80,963 and 87,561 , A. N. S. P., from 

 No. 4576 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is related to C. hypcropiyx, from which it differs in the 

 even striation and very short upper palatal plica, and the weakly 

 continuous superior and spiral lamellae. The clausilium closely resem- 

 bles that of C. hyperoptyx. I reported this species under the name 

 hyperoptyx in these Proceedings for 1901, p. 651, not having at that 

 time opened the specimens. C. hyperoptyx has not been found on 

 Yaeyama, and probably does not occur in the southwestern group of 

 islands. 



Section METAZAPTYX nov. 



Similar to Zaptyx, except that the inferior ilamella ascends spirally 

 within and in the mouth is visible as a fold approaching the superior 

 lamella; the base of the shell is somewhat sack-like. The clausilium 

 is broad, strongly curved distally, shorter than thatof Zaptyx, and 

 rounded at the apex.

The few species now known of this group are scattered over a wide 

 expanse : 



C. hachijoensis Pils. Hachijo-jima, Izu group. 



C. dcemonorum Pils. Kikaiga-shima, Oshima group. 



C. dcemonorum viva Pils. Tokuno-shima, Oshima group. 



C. pattalus Pils. Tarama-jima, Oshima group. 



CJpattalus miyakaensis Pils. Miyaka-jima, Oshima group. 

 Clausilia pattalus n. sp. PI. LVII, figs. 93. 94. 95, 96, 97. 



Shell cylindric below, tapering from the penultimate whorl in a long, 

 somewhat attenuate spire; brown, becoming whitish at the apex. 

 Surface glossy, finely and rather weakly striate, becoming finely and 

 sharply striate on the last third of the last w^horl. Whorls 8^ to 9, 

 convex, the second disproportionately long, the last compressed laterally, 

 very convex beneath. Aperture irregularly ovate, the peristome 

 whitish, re flexed, somewhat thickened within. Superior lamella small 

 marginal, continuous with the low spiral lamella, which penetrates to 

 a point above the columellar lip. Inferior lamella deeply receding, 

 scarcely visible in a front view, but seen in an oblique view as a small 

 fold approaching the superior lamella; within it ascends spirally, and 

 penetrates as far as the spiral lamella. The suhcolumellar lamella is im- 

 mersed. Fulcrum and parallel lamella are developed. Principal plica 

 about one-third of a whorl long. Upper palatal plica rather long, 

 connected in the middle with the lunella, which curves inward below. 

 There are two sutural plicae, the upper one weak or indistinct. 



Length 11.2, diam. 2.5 mm.; whorls 9. 



Length 10, diam. 2.3 mm. ; whorls 8^. 



Clausilium (PI. LVII, figs. 93, 94, 95) rather short, parallel-sided, 

 the distal end very strongly curved ; the apex is blunt, tapering a little 

 on both sides. It is somewhat thickened along the palatal side, and 

 is very abruptly and deeply excised near the filament. 



Taramajima, one of the Miyako subgroup of the Southwestern 

 group. 



Types No. 87,639, A. X. S. P., from No. 1,301a of Mr. Hirase's col- 

 lection. 



This species is stronger than C. dcemonorum viva, from which it differs 

 in the immersed subcolumellar lamella, the less dilated, more immersed 

 inferior lamella, and the better development of the peristome and inter- 

 nal lamellae. There are also differences in the shape of the clausilium. 

 C. pattalus miyakoensis n. subsp. 



Shell thinner, paler, and often smaller than C. pattalus, with the supe- 

 rior lamella smaller. All of the lamellae and plicae are weaker.

Asjthe differences between these specimens and those from Tarama- 

 jima, though slight, are constant, I have thought it best to signalize 

 them by a name. 



Clausilia daemonorum Pils. PL LVII, figs. 98, 99. 

 Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1902, p. 381. 



Having only fossil specimens without the clausilium, I described 

 this species originally as a Stereophcedusa. Recent discoveries by Mr. 

 Hirase have now made it clear that there exists a group of species 

 closely related to Zaptyx, in which the inferior lamella is spiral within. 

 The types of C. dcemonorum show, now that they are more per- 

 fectly cleaned, two sutural plicce, which I did not see when originally 

 describing the species. 



C. dcemonorum differs from C. kikaiensis in the more swollen, sack- 

 like base, larger superior lamella and the less immersed, spirally ascend- 

 ing inferior lamella. 



The species is apparently extinct in the type locality, Kilcaiga-shima, 

 a small, low island which has been pretty thoroughly examined for 

 land shells; but a closely related living form has been sent from 

 Tokunoshima. 



The figures are drawn to a smaller scale than the others on the same 

 plate. 



C. daemonorum viva n. subsp. PI. LVII, figs. 89, 90, 91, 92. 



Shell cylindric below, tapering from the penultimate whorl to the 

 apex, pale yellow or brownish-yeUow, more or less transparent; thin. 

 Surface glossy, with low wrinkles of growth, and behind the lip some 

 stronger stria>. \\Tiorls 8^, those of the spire quite convex, the last 

 two somewhat flattened; last whorl compressed laterally, very convex 

 and sack-like below. Aperture trapezoidal-ovate, the sinulus a little 

 retracted; lip thin, expanded and narrowly reflexed, white. Superior 

 lamella marginal, small, vertical and compressed, continuous with the 

 spiral lamella which is low and delicate. Inferior lamella receding, 

 forming a high compressed fold and approaching the superior lamella 

 in the throat ; within the back of the last whorl it is dilated and ascends 

 in a broadly spiral curve. It is short within, and does not run parallel 

 to the spiral lamella. The subcolumellar lamella emerges. The ful- 

 crum and parallel lamella are very small. The principal plica is about 




834 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



one-third of a whorl long. The upper palatal plica is very short, and 

 connected with the very oblique and curved lunella. There are two 

 weak sutural plicae. 



Length 9.8, diam. 2.2 mm. 



Length 9.5, diam. 2 mm. 



The clausilium (PI. LVII, figs. 90, 91) is rather short, wider below 

 than above, and strongly curved near the rounded apex; it is abruptly 

 and deeply excised near the filament, as usual. 



Bomayama, Tokunoshima, Osumi. Tj-pes No. 87,588, A. N. S. P., 

 from No. 1,201 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This little Clausilia has much in common with the fossil C. dcemono- 

 rum of Kikaiga-shima, but it is somewhat less specialized in having the 

 superior and spiral lamellae continuous. The upper of the two sutural 

 plicae is very weak, and in some specimens hardly perceptible. In one 

 opened I saw a very weak lamella inserta. 



Section PARAZAPTYX nov. 



The shell is similar to Zaptyx, except that the inferior and subcolu- 

 mellar lamellae ascend spirally, as in Metazaptyx; fulcrum and parallel 

 lamella and sutural plicae are absent. The clausilium is wide, tapers 

 strongly to the apex, and is strengthened by a transverse lamellar rib on 

 the convex side. 



The extraordinary clausilium of this group finds no parallel in 

 Asiatic Clausiliidos. Parazaptyx is another of the highly specialized 

 phyla of the Riukiu Islands which give evidence of the ancient origin of 

 these insular faunas. 



In its spirally ascending lamellae and wide clausilium, this Section 

 resembles Metazaptyx, but it is like Hemizaptyx in lacking accessory 

 plicae, and the clausilium is unique. 



Clausilia thaumatopoma n. sp. PI. LVII. figs. 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. 



Shell cylindric below, the upper half tapering and a little attenuated 

 near the apex; brown, the apex pale. Whorls 9, convex, the first two 

 smooth, the second w^horl disproportionately wide; third and subse- 

 quent whorls closely, finely and sharply striate, shining, the striation 

 coarser behind the lip. The aperture is trapezoidal-ovate, retracted 

 at the sinulus, not projecting, brown inside ; the peristome is pale-edged, 

 very narrowly reflexed, obtuse but hardly thickened. The superior 

 lamella is subvertical, marginal, rather high, and continuous with the 

 low spiral lamella, which penetrates to the middle of the ventral side. 

 The inferior lamella recedes very deeply, and is not visible in a front

view, though seen obHquely from the base it appears as a rather high 

 thin lamella. Within it ascends in a widely spiral curve. The sub- 

 columellar lamella emerges to the lip-edge, and ascends in a sigmoid 

 curve. The principal plica is about a half whorl long, dorsal and 

 lateral. The upper palatal plica is very oblique, and weakly joined 

 to the lunella, which is oblique, straight above, arcuate, curving inward 

 below. 



Length 10.5. diain. 2.5 mm. 



Clausilium (PI. LVII, figs. 100, 101, 104) short and wide, well curved, 

 at the distal end tapering to a blunt apex, somewhat excavated on the 

 palatal side. It is deeply excised on the columellar side of the filament. 

 On the outer, convex surface there is a transverse plate extending from 

 side to side.

Externally this species is much like the striate species of Zaptyx, 

 but the sigmoid lamellae and unique clausilium distinguish it. 



Section OLIGOZAPTYX nov. 



The shell is very small, fusiform, with no superior lamella. The 

 inferior lamella forms a squarish fold in the throat and the subcolu- 

 mellar lamella is obsolete below. There is a long lower palatal plica 

 and short upper united with the lunella. Sutural plicse and a lamella 

 fulcrans are developed. The clausilium is notched on the palatal side 

 of the projecting apex, and excised on the columellar side of the fila- 

 ment. 



Type C. hedleyi. 



In this extraordinary phylum the clausilium resembles that of 

 Diceratoptyx, while the palatal armature is totally unlike any other 

 known Zaptychoid form by the development of a large lower palatal 

 plica. The whole closing apparatus is of a highly evolved type. 



Clausilia hedleyi n. sp. PI. LVII, figs. 105-110. 



Shell very small, fusiform, attenuated above, amber-colored, trans- 

 parent; ahnost smooth, with a brilliant gloss, the last whorl slightly 

 striate behind the lip. Whorls 7f , convex, the last narrow and taper- 

 ing downward. Aperture projecting free in front, piriform, the white 

 lip narrowly reflexed. Superior lamella obsolete, represented merely 

 by a slight thickening of the peristome. Spiral lamella small, low and 

 short, lateral. Inferior lamella receding, forming a strongly projecting 

 squarish and bifid fold in the throat, low within. Subcolumellar

lamella wholly immersed, subobsolete. Principal plica long, extending 

 from a ventral position nearly to the aperture. Lunella lateral, united 

 to the middle of a long, curved lower palatal plica, and with its upper 

 end continued inward in a shorter upper palatal plica, much as in C. 

 platydera and its allies. There are two minute sutural plicae and a 

 short lamella fulcrans. 



Length 7.8, diam. 1.7 mm. 



Clausilium (PI. LVII, figs. 105, 106, 107, 108) rather short, parallel- 

 sided, abruptly bent at the apex and twisted into a sort of spout, 

 notched on the palatal side of the projecting apex. 



Tokunoshima, Osumi, at Matsubara. Types No. 87,589, A. N. S. P., 

 from No. 1,202 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This is one of the smallest as well as one of the most specialized of 

 Asiatic Clausilise. It is named in honor of my friend, Charles Hedley. 



The clausilium is both abruptly curved and twisted near the apex, 

 so that its true shape is not easily conveyed by figures. The apical 

 end, however, is well shown by figs. 105 and 108, while it is seen much 

 foreshortened in figs. 106 and 107. 



Section DICERATOPTYX nov. 



The glossy shell is Zaptychoid, the superior lamella developed, 

 inferior lamella receding, calloused below. Subcolumcllar lamella 

 rising high on the palatal wall, dilated in a lateral position. Upper 

 palatal plica very long, an extremely short lunella descending from near 

 its inner end. Lamella fulcrans and parallela and sutural plicae are 

 developed. Clausilium deeply excised as usual at the filament, and 

 with a deep notch excavated near the apex on the palatal side. 



The very long upper palatal plica and diminutive lunella, and the 

 peculiar clausilium, are characteristic. The dilated subcolumcllar 

 lamella, which rises high on the palatal wall, takes the place of a lower 

 palatal plica. 



The clausilium resembles that of Oligozaptyx, but the notch near the 

 distal end has been independently evolved in the two groups ; that of 

 Diceratoptyx being adapted to fit over the dilated subcolumcllar lamella, 

 while in Oligozaptyx the notch fits over the lower palatal plica, and 

 has been evolved with the evolution of the latter. 



The internal structure is i^artially shown in PI. LVII, fig. 113: /, 

 fulcrum; p, parallel lamella; sp, spiral lamella; inf, inferior lamella; 

 sc, subcolumcllar lamella. The characteristic dilation of the latter 

 is well shown, as well as its course upon the palatal wall of the shell, 

 through which it is seen by transparence.

Clausilia cladoptyx n. sp. PI. LVII, figs. 111-11.5. 



Shell cylindric below, the upper half regularly tapering; amber or 

 brownish-amber colored; almost entirely smooth, with a varnish-like 

 gloss. "Wliorls 9, quite convex. Aperture ovate; peristome reflexed, 

 slightly thickened. Superior lamella small, vertical, marginal, con- 

 tiguous to or continuous with the spiral lamella, which penetrates 

 nearly to the ventral side. Inferior lamella more or less receding, 

 forming a very strong fold in the throat, ascending in a very broad 

 sigmoid plate, abruptly diminishing to a small thread above, which 

 revolves parallel to the spiral lamella, but does not penetrate so deeply. 

 Subcolumellar lamella emerging to the lip-edge; inside it dilates, rising 

 in an angle in a lateral position. Outside of the spiral lamella there are 

 two short equal, parallel lamellae (lamella fulcrans and I. parallela). 

 The principal plica is dorsal and lateral, visible in the throat, and nearly 

 a half whorl long; below it there is a very long upper palatal plica, 

 which at its inner end gives out a very short oblique branch downward, 

 the lunella. Below this there is a short palatal plica, at least in some 

 specimens. Above the principal plica there are two sutural plicae, 

 the lower one well developed, the upper small. 



Length 10, diam. 2.2 mm. 



Length 9, diam. 2 mm. 



The clausilium (PI. LVII, figs. Ill, 112) is short and wide, parallel- 

 sided ; there is a deep semicircular notch near the apex on the palatal 

 side, and a deep excision on the columellar side of the filament. A 

 marginal rib runs along the columellar side from the excision to the 

 notch.

REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



Sixteen meetings have been held during the year, on the first and 

 third Tuesdays from October to May inclusive, with an average attend- 

 ance of thirty-six. Verbal communications were made by Messrs. 

 A. E. Brown, Sharp, Keeley, Calvert, Chapman, Pilsbry, Fowler, 

 Stone, Borden, Goodspeed, Phillips, Conklin, Nelson, Willcox, S. Brown, 

 Moore, Wetherill, ]\Iiss Wardle and Miss Keller. 



Fifty-two papers were presented for publication, as follows : James

 and G. H. Parker, 1; Everett F. Phillips, 1; R. V. Chamberlin, 1; 

 Charles W. Johnson, 1; Albert M. Reese, 1. 



One of these, Fowler's Fishes of Sumatra, forms the concluding num- 

 ber of Volume XII of the Journal, six were returned to the authors, two 

 were transferred to the Entomological Section, one is held under 

 consideration, four have been accepted for publication in the volume 

 for 1905, and the others constitute the current volume of the Pro- 

 ceedings. 



A paper by Edward G. Conklin, Ph.D., entitled The Organization 

 and Cell-Lineage of the Ascidian Egg, to form the first number of the 

 Journal, \'olume XIII, is going through the press, and will be ready 

 for publication as soon as five of the plates in color, now being prepared 

 in Germany, are received. 



Eight hundred and ninety-five pages of tlie Proceedings and 59 

 plates, 70 pages and 22 plates of the Journal, 352 pages and 20 plates 

 of the Entomological News, 299 pages and 20 plates of the Transactions 

 of the American Entomological Society (Entomological Section of the 




840 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



Academy), and 353 pages illustrated by 60 plates of the Manual of 

 Conchology have been published. 



The issues of the Proceedings and Journal have been distributed as 

 follows : 



Proceedings, delivered to members, 498 



" exchanged, 560 



" to subscribers, 40 



1,098 



Journal, exchanged, 72 



" to subscribers, 34 



106 



The decrease in the number of copies of the Proceedings sent out is 

 due to a careful revision of the Exchange List, those societies being 

 dropped, after due notification, from whom it is unlikely that a return 

 will be received. 



Sixteen members and two correspondents have been elected. The 

 deaths of sixteen members and four correspondents have been an- 

 nounced. The following have resigned their membership: William J. 

 Scott, Norris J. Scott, H. B. Gross, 0. S. Paxson, WilHam D. Joyce, 

 William R. Reineck, C. M. Thomas and H. H. Furness. 



In consequence of a decrease in the membership of the Conchological 

 Section it ceased to exist in March, and the publication of the Manual 

 of Conchology, the property of the Section since the death of the first 

 editor, Mr. George W. Tr\^on, Jr., has been assumed by the Academy. 

 The w^ork will be continued under the direction of Henry A. 

 Pilsbry, Sc.D. Mr. S. Raymond Roberts, formerly Treasurer of the 

 Conchological Section, has kindly consented to retain the financial 

 administration of the Manual, and has reported on the receipts and 

 expenditures since the dissolution of the Section. 



Dr. Charles B. Penrose was elected a member of the Council to fill 

 the vacancy caused by the absence of Mr. Charles H. Cramp, 



The resignation of Mr. Harold Wingate from the Committee on 

 Accounts, because of removal from the city, was accepted. 



The meetings of a nmnber of related societies continue to be held 

 in the rooms of the Academy. 



I desire to acknowledge my obligation to ]\Ir. William J. Fox for 

 most efficient assistance in the preparation and distribution of the 

 publications and in other matters connected with my office.

Recording Secretary. 




1904.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 841 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



During the past year, as usual, the bulk of the correspondence with 

 scientific societies and institutions was concerned with the exchange 

 of periodical publications, the number of which acknowledged shows 

 a material increase. Several proposals to exchange publications were 

 referred to the Publication Committee, and requests for the loan of 

 collections or offers of specimens to the Curators. 



The year has been noteworthy for the number of deaths of prominent 

 scientific men and for the importance of its international congresses of 

 learning. Formal notices of no fewer than eight deaths of Presidents 

 of societies and Directors of museums were received and duly acknowl- 

 edged in letters of condolence. 



Invitations to the Academy to participate were received from the 

 Organizing Committees of four international congresses, but in each 

 case, beyond an expression of interest, no formal action was taken by 

 the Academy and no delegates were appointed. 



The deaths of four distinguished correspondents — Karl A. Zittel, 

 Hcmy M. Stanley, R. A. Phillippi and Eduard von Martens — occurred 

 during the year and were announced from the Chair. In the election 

 of Profs. A. A. W. Hubrecht, of Utrecht, and Frantisek Vejdovsky, of 

 Prag, the high standard of scientific attainment now required by the 

 Academy as a condition of corresponding membership is maintained. 

 Fourteen correspondents have contributed their photographs, accom- 

 panied in most cases by biographical sketches. 



Following are the statistics of the year's correspondence:

shelves with these Hsts leaves nineteen works unaccounted for. With 

 the exception of two volumes of bound pamphlets and four of somewhat 

 antiquarian interest, they are recent works of small pecuniar}' value 

 which can readily be replaced. 



That a like account of stock may be taken of the journals and 

 periodicals it will be necessary that a similar shelf-list be made of this 

 department. This will be a work of some magnitude and of undoubted 

 importance. It is hoped that it may be accomplished next 3'^ear. 



Ten hundred and twenty-six volumes have been bound, and 72 maps 

 trimmed, backed with linen and added to the collection. 



A collection of twenty-six catalogues, announcements, etc., issued by 

 the University of Athens, were transferred to the library of the Univer- 

 sity of Pennsylvania; 3 volumes and 13 pamphlets on theology to the 

 Seminary of St. Charles Borromeo, 19 volumes and 175 pamphlets 

 on niLscellaneous literature to the Free Librar}' of Philadelphia. An 

 accumulation of 103 State documents, in no way related to the 

 Academy's work, were returned to Harrisburg. 



A set of fine mahogany cases, formerly containing the library of the 

 late Dr. Charles Schaeffer, has been presented to the Academy by Mrs. 

 Schaeffer. They have been placed in the Council room, replacing those 

 received in 1895 wdth the Meigs librar}^, and greatl}' improve the 

 appearance of the apartment. 



As heretofore, I am glad to acknowledge the intelligent service of 

 my assistant, Mr. "William J. Fox, in all departments of the library 

 work.

REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The collections in the care of the Curators are in an excellent state 

 of preservation, with all the data carefully recorded. During the 

 past year important progress has been made in the details of arrange- 

 ment and identification. 



Additions and alterations to the heating plant have permitted the 

 heating of the Museum. ^lany needed repairs have been made to 

 the roof and other parts of the building. 



Additional window-shades have been placed in the ^luseum and in 

 the alcoholic department to protect the specimens from the light. 



The Council room has been completely renovated and handsomely 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 815 



furnished with mahogany book cases, the gift of !Mrs. Charles Schaeffer, 

 who has Hkewise presented a lantern and screen. 



The groinids adjoining the ]\Iuseum have been sown with grass and 

 carefully tended during the 3^ear, greatly improving their appearance. 



In the ^luseuin the installation of plate glass and mahogany cases 

 has continued, 3,500 cubic feet of exhibition space having been pro- 

 vided dining the year for mammals, birds and invertebrates. An 

 oak wall-case has been placed in the Archaeological department and 

 the woodwork of most of the old cases has been refinished. Numerous 

 storage cases for birds, mammals, insects, plants and mollusks have 

 been purchased. 



Through the liberality of ^Ir. Clarence B. Moore, ^lessrs. Stewardson 

 Brown and H. W. Fowler were sent on a six-weeks' trip to the south- 

 western Florida keys in search of specimens of Liguus to supplement 

 a valuable series collected and presented by Mr. Moore from the 

 eastern and western coasts and adjacent keys. Though unsuccessful 

 in its immediate object, the expedition obtained valuable collections 

 of fishes, plants, etc. Later Mr. Moore sent out a second expedition, 

 securing a series of the desired mollusks. 



Dr. H. A. Pilsbry spent two months in Cuba investigating the mol- 

 luscan fauna in the interests of the Academy, and Mr. J. A. G. Rehn 

 was engaged for one month in collecting insects and birds in southern 

 Georgia. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore has added a number of valuable specimens to 

 his collection of Indian antiquities from Florida. Among other notable 

 gifts of the year may be mentioned a large series of Indian implements, 

 plants, birds and minerals, the collection of the late Dr. Charles Schaeffer, 

 presented by Mrs. Schaeffer, a collection of ethnological material from 

 Lieut. Frederick Schober, and numerous valuable specimens of mam- 

 mals, birds and reptiles from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia. 

 Several important collections have also been secured by purchase. 



Besides the work detailed in the appended reports of the Sections, 

 Mr. Fowler has continued the arrangement and identification of the 

 fishes, and made numerous local collections. 



Dr. Moore has cared for and added to the helminthological collection. 



Dr. Pilsbry and Mr. Vanatta have made important advances in the 

 identification and arrangement of the mollusca. The report of the 

 Special Curator of this department is added. 



Mr. Rehn has cleaned the greater part of the small mannnal skulls 

 belonging to the Rhoads and Bunnell collections, upward of 3,000 being 

 thus added to the study series.

Mr. Stone, with the assistance of the Jessiip students, has rearranged 

 the entire series of reptiles and batrachians, reUeving their overcrowded 

 condition, and has labelled and tagged with metal numbers the entire 

 series of Garter Snakes, as well as all recent accessions. Twelve 

 thousand metal tags have been prepared and the work of tagging the 

 whole collection will be pushed as rapidly as possible. 



Miss H. N. Wardlc has been constantly engaged in labelling, cata- 

 loguing and arranging the archaeological collections, rendering them 

 much more instructive to the student and visitor. 



The preparator, Mr. McCadden, has mounted a number of mammals, 

 notably an African Buffalo, and has prepared many specimens for the 

 study collections. 



Besides the services rendered by the ]\Iuseum staff and the students 

 of the Jessup Fund, the Curators are indebted to Dr. Philip P. Calvert, 

 Mr. Erich Daecke, Mr. H. W. Wenzel, Mr. H. L. Viereck and Mr. E. T. 

 Cresson, Jr., for assistance in the Entomological department. 



The Anti-Tuberculosis Society, Philadelphia Botanical Club, Nomen-

Report of the Special Curator of the Department of Mollusca. 



The accessions to the collection of mollusks during 1904 have ex- 

 ceeded in number those of any year since the reception of the A. D. 

 Brown collection in LSS7. Specimens have been received from 78 

 sources, the most valuable or extensive being the following: 



A series of 330 lots of shells from the keys and adjacent mainland of 

 Florida, from ]Mr. Clarence B. ]\Ioore, part collected by his own party, 

 part by others sent by him to collect mollusks. This is by far 

 the most extensive series of mollusks ever obtained on the Florida 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 847 



keys. The specimens have been determined and studied, and it is 

 hoped that the results, suitably illustrated, will be published during the 

 coming year. 



A series of Japanese mollusks, some 650 lots, received from ]\Ir. Y. 

 Hirase, of Kyoto, has also been studied, but only the new forms have 

 been published, comprising about 140 new species and about 30 new- 

 subspecies. 



Mr. J. H. Ferriss has generously divided his valuable Arizona col- 

 lections w4th us. The study of this material, with that collected by 

 Mr. Ferriss and the Special Curator in 1903, is nearly complete. An 

 unexpectedly large number of new and interesting forms were found. 



Early in the year an attempt was made to increase our collection of 

 fresh-water bivalves of the genus Pisidium. Some 70 lots were 

 obtained from various correspondents, 10 of them cotypes and a large 

 number of them topot}'pes. With the specimens already in our pos- 

 session, these additions probably make our collection the most com- 

 plete in existence. 



A series of the mollusks of the Alabama river system, collected this 

 year by Mr. H. H. Smith, has been purchased. It consists of about 

 17,000 specimens. These remain to be determined and installed. 



During the spring the Special Curator explored a portion of central 

 Cuba for mollusks, obtaining a collection of some 500 lots, about 10,000 

 specimens. This collection also remains to be studied. 



The chief work in the Museum has been the revision of the African 

 Achatinidce. ]\Iuch other work of correction and relabelling has been 

 done in connection with studies on new material. 



Four papers have been published in the Proceedings of I'the Academy 

 by the Special Curator, one with Mr. Vanatta, and one in conjunction 

 with Mr. Hirase, while ten have been published by the Special Curator 

 in the Nautilus. These have chiefly dealt with the classification and 

 description of new material. 



The time of the Special Curator has been largely occupied, as hitherto, 

 in the publication of the Manual of Conchology. The volume for this 

 year treats of the African family Achatinidce. 



The efficient assistance of Mr. E. G. \'anatta in the work of the 

 department throughout the year should be acknowledged.

REPORTS OF THE SECTIONS. 



MiNERALOGICAL AXD GEOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The Section has this year kept up its meetings and field excursions 

 even more zealously than last year, vnth about double the number of 

 communications, one-third larger attendance on the meetings, 

 one-half more on the excursions, and an increase of more than 

 one-quarter in membership. 



There have been nine meetings, with an average attendance of over 

 11. Communications were made by Miss Emma Walter, on old 

 stream-beds; by B. S. Lyman, on the immense time indicated 

 by erosion; by Prof. B. L. Miller, on graphite occurring in Chester 

 County, Pa.; by B. S. Lyman, on the Bechtel graphite mine, near 

 Boyerstown, Berks County, Penasylvania ; b}' Miss Mary S. Holmes, 

 on the Virginia Natural Bridge; by B. S. Lyman, on topography 

 an aid to geology; by Miss Emma Walter, on clay near Saylorsburg, 

 Monroe County, Pennsylvania; by Mr. F. J. Keeley, on the trap of 

 Cape Ann, Massachusetts; by Miss Mar}^ S. Holmes, on some prob- 

 lems suggested by the excursion along the Perkiomen; by Mr. T. 

 Chalkley Palmer, on serpentines of Delaware County, Pennsylvania; 

 by Mr. F. J. Keeley, on serpentines under the microscope ; and about 

 20 shorter communications, besides various discussions. 



There were 7 field excursions, with an average attendance of 43. 

 The excursions visited: 1. The crystalline rocks and their minerals, 

 particularly kaolin, between Hockessin, Delaware, and Kennett 

 Square, Chester County, Pennsylvania; 2. The crystalline rocks near 

 Glen i\lills and Lenni, on Chester Creek, and at Mineral Hill, Delaware 

 County, Pennsylvania; 3. The crystalline rocks near Avondale, Strath- 

 Haven, Rose Valley and Media, Delaware County, Pennsylvania; 

 4. Portions of the New Red Perkasie shales and Pottstown shales and 

 trap, from Lodel Creek to Spring Mountain, near the Perkiomen, and 

 Schwenksville, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; 5. Portions of the 

 New Red Norristown shales and Gwynedd shales, and some of the 

 gneiss southward, between Noble Station and Doylestown; 6. The 

 crystalhne rocks near Newtown Square, Delaware County, Pennsyl- 

 vania; 7. The crystalline rocks between Newtown Square and Media, 

 Delaware County, Pennsylvania. 



The membership of the Section has increased by ten in all, namely, 

 seven contributors and three members of the Academy, one of whom 

 became a member through his interest in the Section. The Section 




1904.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 849 



now contains 27 members of the Academy and 21 contributors, or 48 

 in all. 



The following officers of the Section have been elected for the yesxv

Director. 



The Biological and Microscopical Section. 



The numerical strength of the Section is the same as that of last 

 year, two members having withdrawn and two having been admitted. 



The interest in the regular sessions has been increased by the dis- 

 cussions at the informal meetings which have formed a pleasant feature 

 of the year's work. Numerous communications have been made, 

 among which may be especially mentioned those of Mr. F. J. Keeley on 

 various accessories of microscopic manipulation; by Mr. T. C. Palmer on 

 Trachelomonas; by Dr. D. E. Owen on dredgings in Saco Bay, and by 

 ^Ir. Hugo Bilgram on Myxomycetes. Every member present has made 

 an effort to offer at each meeting some object or subject which, if not 

 new, has at least stimulated the work of others. A special topic which 

 has occupied the attention of the Section is that of the microscopic 

 structure of rocks. 



The Conservator reports that the instruments belonging to the Sec- 

 tion arc in good working order, and the following additions have been 

 made during the past year : One Zentmayer Portable Histological Stand, 

 one Dissecting Microscope, one Beck Microscope Lamp, one Acme 

 ^licroscope Lamp, one Balance, two large Slide Cabinets with Drawers, 

 four small Slide Cabinets with Trays, some miscellaneous accessories 

 and over 500 mounted slides, all presented by Mrs. Charles Shaeffcr. 

 One hundred and fifty-eight slides, prepared by L. Woolman, were 

 presented by Ur. F. J. Keeley. 



One Tolles -Vincli Objective was purchased.

 been published in the Entomological News and Proceedings of the Ento- 

 mological Section. This journal has been continued and Volume XV 

 completed with 352 pages and 20 plates. One hundred and five book 

 or Schmitt boxes have been purchased, and three of the new tin pest- 

 proof cases to hold them. Rearrangements have been made of por- 

 tions of the collections and new material added by gift, purchase and 

 exchange, to the number of over 7,000 specimens. The collection of 

 Orthoptcra has been increased by the presentation of nearly 500 

 specimens, the gift of Mr. Morgan Hebard. This order has also been 

 enriched by the reception of over 700 specimens from Dr. Henri de 

 Saussure, containing manj^ genera and species new to the collection. 



Valuable additions have been made to the cabinets by purchase, 

 including 766 Orthoptera from Japan and the Loo Choo Islands ; 274

The Botanical Section. 



During the year much progress has been made in the arrangement 

 of the Herbarium, the collections now being in better condition and 

 more readily accessible than ever before. 



The erection of new cases in the centre of the south herbarium room 

 has resulted in the rearrangement of all the flowering plants, thus 

 relieving the congested condition of many of the cases. 



The large case containing seeds, etc., formerly in the south room, has 

 been moved to the north gallery room, where it is readily accessible 

 to any one desiring to stud}'^ its contents. 



Over 18,000 sheets have been added to the collection during the 

 year, acquired principally by purchase and exchange, although many 

 liberal donations have been received. 



These include the herbarium of the late Dr. Charles Schaeffer, con- 

 taining his collections for many seasons in the British Columbia 

 region, presented by Mrs. ]\Iary S. Shaeffer ; and the gift by Dr. Ida 

 A. Keller of her entire herbarium, including a number of plants from 

 Europe. 



Smaller collections were received from ]\Ir. Charles S. Williamson, 

 from the eastern United States; Mr. Benjamin H. Smith, from south 

 Florida; the United States National IMuseum and Messrs. Witmer 

 Stone, E. G. Vanatta, Dr. Campbell E. Waters, Edward Potts, Henry S. 

 Conard, and the Conservator. These are noted in detail in the 

 Additions to the Museum. 



The Section has purchased a collection of 178 sheets of Washington 

 plants from Mr. Henry S. Conard, and 365 sheets of California plants 

 from Mr. A. A. Heller, the collections of the past season, containing 

 many novelties. 



The important collection made by Mr. Herbert H. Smith in the 

 Santa Marta region of Colombia has been purchased by the Academy, 

 and numbers 2,500 sheets; also the West African collections of Dr. 

 Pritzel, numbering 1,776 sheets, "and the herbarium of Alexander 

 MacElwee, acquired through purchase and exchange, mmibering 

 approximately 10,000 sheets, a considerable proportion of which are 

 mounted. 



The Academy's expeditions added 450 sheets, as follows : 



Thomasville, Georgia, 50 sheets, collected by Mr. J. A. G. Rehn; 

 Cuba and southern Florida, 125 and 25 respectively, collected by Dr. 

 H. A. Pilsbiy, and from the Florida keys, 250 sheets, collected by the 

 Conservator. 




852 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dcc, 



All the specimens received have been poisoned, and a considerable 

 number mounted and distributed through the Herbarium. 



The series of field excursions conducted during April and early. May 

 by the Conservator were largely attended. 



j\Iuch assistance was rendered during the year to students and 

 visiting botanists desiring to consult the collections. 



The Philadelphia Botanical Club has continued to hold its meetings 

 during the year, its members having contributed over 400 sheets to 

 the local Herbarium, which collection has been placed in excellent 

 condition through the unremitting labors of Mr. Samuel S. Van Pelt. 



At the meeting of the Section held December 13, 1904, the following 

 were elected as officers for the ensuing year: 



Director, ]Mr. Benjamin H. Smith. 



Vice-Director, Mr. Joseph Crawford. 



Recorder, Dr. Ida A. Keller. 



Secretary, Mr. John T. Pennypacker. 



Treasurer and Conservator, . . Stewardson Brown. 

 Respectfully submitted, 



Stewardson Brown, 



Conservator. 



The Ornithological Section. 



The ornithological collections of the Academy were never in better 

 condition nor more accessible to the student than at present. 



During the past year three additional exhibition cases have been 

 erected in the new gallery, permitting the transfer of the entire series 

 of Raptorial birds, as well as the Pigeons. The rearrangement and 

 labelling of the former group has been completed and many duplicate 

 specimens not required for exhibition have been arranged in the study 

 series. At the present time only the Passerine and Picarian birds 

 remain in the old building, and the majority of these will be transferred 

 next year. 



Thirteen additional tin storage cases and ten wooden cases have been 

 provided for the accommodation of the study collection, greatly 

 facilitating the arrangement of many groups, especially the birds of 

 prey, and providing needed space for the numerous accessions. 



The Conservator has examined practically all the large bird skins 

 during the year, and carefully rearranged the old unmounted material 

 which has been listed to facilitate consultation. 



Many important additions have been made to the collection, fore- 




1904. 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



853 



most among which is a series of 360 Philippine birds purchased by the 

 Academ)^; a handsome collection of mounted Humming-birds, the gift 

 of Cah-in Pardee, Esq., and collections from the West Indies, Colorado 

 and California, presented respectively by Dr. J. Percy Moore, Robert 

 T. Young and W. 0. Emerson. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club has continued to hold its 

 meetings at the Academy, and has done much to stimulate ornitho- 

 logical study. The collections have been largely consulted during the 

 year, and considerable assistance has been rendered to visiting orni- 

 thologists. 



The Conservator would acknowledge valuable assistance in the care 

 of the collections to Mr. Paul L, Lorrilliere. 



At the annual meeting of the Section, held December 19, 1904, the
