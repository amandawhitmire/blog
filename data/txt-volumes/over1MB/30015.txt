Original Centers Concerned in North Arnerican Plant Dispersal. — 

 John W. Harshberger, Ph.D., remarked that the northern part of 

 North America was covered during Miocene times with a dense forest 

 of trees, the living representatives of which include the sequoias, mag- 

 nolias, oaks, eucalyptus and species of the genus Cinnamoynum and 

 certain palms, and that these extended as far north as Greenland. 

 As early as the close of the Cretaceous period we find an indication of 

 the separation of the American flora into an eastern and a western 

 division. In the eastern division, the deciduous trees perhaps predomi- 

 nated ; in the western, the coniferous vegetation formed a large per- 

 centage of the floral elements. The great continental glacier de- 

 stroyed this forest in the north, but remnants of it remained in the 

 south . 



At the close of the glacial period, the following centers of distribu- 

 tion of plants might have been recognized : first, the deciduous forest 

 in the east; second, the prairie flora at the center of the continent; 

 thii-d, the great coniferous forest of the Pacific northwest; fourth, the 

 desert or xerophytic flora of the Mexican tableland; fifth, the great 

 American tropic flora which occupied at one time an Antillean conti- 

 nent that later broke up into several physiographic units, viz., the 

 islands of the Greater Antilles, Central America and northern South 

 America. Wliile this Antillean landmass existed, Mexico was sepa- 

 rated from it. 



With the disappearance of the glacial ice sheet, the equilibrium 

 between these separate floras was disturbed. The tundra vegetation 

 and other Arctic species occupied during the glacial period the margin 

 of the great ice sheet. These plants migrated north to the Arctic 

 regions, but many remained behind to form the vegetation of sphagnum 

 bogs and alpine summits of the higher mountains. The deciduous 

 floras spread northward and northwestward, such plants as Populvs 

 tremuloides and Betula papyrifera reaching to Cook Inlet, Alaska. 

 The prairie flora spread northward, reaching Saskatchewan, and south- 

 ward to Texas. The Pacific coast conifers spread northward to Cook 

 Inlet, Alaska, eastward to the Rocky Mountains and then' southward, 

 supplying one of the elements of the Rocky jMountain flora. The 

 Mexican xerophytes — yuccas, agaves, cacti and the like — spread north- 

 ward into a territory which was before the glacial period characterized 

 by a more humid climate (hence the presence of many eastern decidu- 

 ous trees), and which later assumed an arid climate with the consequent 

 destruction of the deciduous element and the spread of the coniferous 

 associations. The tropic center of northern South America, the West 

 Indies, and Central America supplied part of Florida and much of low- 

 land Mexico with tro]:)ic plants. The differences, now found, being 

 emphasized b}^ the separation of the islands from each other and the 

 isolation of the floras by physiographic changes. 



A study of the several regions above mentioned emphasizes the 

 fact, that centers of distribution are determined by the following cri- 

 teria: location of the greatest differentiation of type; of dominance or 

 great abundance of individuals; of the presence of peculiar endemic 

 forms; of the continuity and convergence of lines of dispersal.

ANNOTATED LIST OF THE TYPES OF INVERTEBRATE CRETACEOUS FOSSILS 



IN THE COLLECTION OF THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL 



SCIENCES, PHILADELPHIA. 



BY CHARLES W. JOHNSON. 



The following list of types and figured specimens was made during 

 1902. Leaving Philadelphia early the following year, I have been 

 unable until the present time to verify some of the notes on syn- 

 onymy, etc. No attempt has been made to fully work out the syn- 

 onymy, so that only the published synonyms bearing on the types are 

 given, usually where recent generic changes have been adopted. The 

 generic position of many of the species is doubtful, as they are based 

 on casts often lacking essential characters; the grouping of some of 

 the species in families is therefore only provisional. Although a very 

 thorough study was made of all the cretaceous material, a few types 

 which should be in the collection are missing. I have not recorded 

 these, as they may be found upon further search.

 Represented by three specimens; the smaller one, and not the speci-

 one figured by Conrad.

 Syn. Org. Rem., 64, pi. 3, f. 8 ; pi. 13, f. 6, 1S34. 



Represented by 16 specimens accompanied by Morton's original 

 label (No. 393), but the specimen is not numbered and the figure is too 

 poor to positively identify. 



Cuoullaea antrosa Morton, Syn. Org. Rem., 65, pi. 13, f. 6, 1834. 



A specimen marked "type" in Gabb's handwriting. 



Cucullaea tippana Courad, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., Ill, 2 ser., 328, pi. 35, f. 1, 1858. 

 CucuUsea capax Conrad, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., Ill, 2 ser., 328, pi. 35, f. 2, 1858. 



Both C. tippona and C. capax will probably prove to be synonyms 

 of C. vulgaris Morton. 

 Cucullaea maconensis Conrad, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., IV, 2 ser., 281, pi. 47, f. 20, 1860. 



Type of the genus Trigonarca Conr. (Am. Jour. Conch., Ill, 9, 1867). 



Cucullaea neglecta Gabb, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1861, p. 326. 



The species is based on a number of specimens; the actual type can- 

 not be defined. Whitfield considers it the same as C. antrosa Morton. 

 If so it is the j^oung. 



Cucullaea transversa Gabb, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1861, p. 326. 



The specimen figured by Whitfield as Trigonarca transversa (pi. XII, 

 figs. 14, 15) is not the type. I found the true type in a drawer contain- 

 ing material marked "Gabb collection." This is not the C. transversa 

 Rogers, 1839, and being preoccupied, I propose the name of C. gahbi 

 for this species.

CucuUaea alabamensis Gabb. 



Idonearca alabamensis Gabb, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1876, p. 31.5. 

 The type, a characteristic specimen of Prairie Bluff, Alabama, is so 

 altered by the work of the boring sponge (Clione) that all shell charac- 

 ters are obliterated. It is probably a synonym of C. vulgaris or 

 tippana.

Area (Macrodon) eufalensis Gabb, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., IV, 2 ser., 398 

 pi. 68, f. 39, 1860. 



Whitfield's so-called type (pi. 12, fig. 5) may represent another 

 species or the same as Conrad's, but the exterior is so eroded that spe- 

 cific characters are obliterated. 

 Nemodon eufalensis Conrad, 1869 (not of Gabb). 



Conrad's type of the genus Nemodon {Am. Jour. Conch., Ill, 9, and 

 V, 97, pi. IX, f. 16). This is a very different species from Nemodon 

 eufalensis Gabb. I therefore propose the name of N. conradi for this 

 species.

The specimen figured by Whitfield (pi. XII, figs. 1, 2) as probably 

 from Haddonfield, New Jersey, is more likely to be from Snow Hill, 

 North Carolina. The micaceous "marl" from Haddonfield is harder,

Tliis is now considered a synonym of G. corrugata Say. 

 Gryphaea mutabilis Morton, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., VI, 81, pi. IV, f. 3, 1828. 



Dr. Dall is wrong in considering this a synonym of Ostrea compressi- 

 rostra. The specimen he refers to might be that species, but the type 

 is not; it is a broad, flattened form of G. convexa Say, which is consid- 

 ered by most authors to be the same as Lamarck's G. vesicularis. 

 Gryphaea convexa (Say). 



The specimen figured by Morton (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci., VI, 79, pi. 4, 

 figs. 1, 2, 1828). 



Gryphaea bryanii Gabb, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1876, 321. 



The specimens figured by Whitfield (pi. 27, figs. 6-9) are not the types, 

 but probably a suite of co-types presented to the Academy by Gabb. 

 Specimens marked "type" in Gabb's handwriting I found in the 

 drawer marked "Gabb collection" above referred to.

In the drawer containing the "Gabb collection" above referred to, 

 I found the types of this species, which were not studied by Prof. Wliit- 

 field when writing his monograph. These show, as Gabb says, a resem- 

 blance to Tornatella bullata Morton, but is a smaller species, "the spire 

 higher," etc. The "two folds on the columella" are very distinct. 

 The specimen figured by Wliitfield (pi. XX, figs, o, 6) as the type of 

 "Cinulia cvoidea" Gabb, is a specimen of A. cntacea. Not having the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 19 



types of this species probably led Prof. Whitfield to describe the type 

 of A. ovoidea Gabb, as a new species, " Actoeon suhovoides," although 

 the original label was present. Both of Gabb's species arc well de- 

 scribed, and in the true types all the characters in the original descrip- 

 tions are clearly shown. There are also in the Academy's collection 

 the specimens figured by Whitfield on pi. 19, figs. 9-12.

The type of this species is what Gabb figured by mistake for the 

 type of Delphinula lapidosa Mort. (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. IV, 2 ser., 

 300, pi. 48, figs. 5a, b. With the specimen there is an original label 

 in Gabb's hand\^Titing, " Sti'aparolus deplanatus Gabb, Cretaceous, 

 Ala." On the specimen is wTitten the word '' type." This seems 

 to be a good species, the characters of which are well shown in 

 the figure referred to. It is more depressed than S. lapidosus, the 

 body whorl being almost uniforml}^ rounded above and below. 

 While practically an internal cast, the spire still has some of the shell 

 (altered to calcite) remaining, which shows a slight crenulation below 

 the suture. The specimen evidently came from Prairie Bluff, Alabama. 

 I have been unable to find a description.

I have been unable to positively determine the tj^pe of Rostellaria

 bered (219) in Morton's handwriting (as most of his types are) agrees 

 well with the description but not with the figure. It is a cast, and 

 characteristic of the material from Prairie Bluff, Alabama. Three 

 specimens (one nearly perfect) from Snow Hill, North Carofina, which 

 Conrad has doubtfully referred to this species, on an original label, but 

 which he has described and figured erroneously as ^'Anchura rostrata 

 Morton" (Kerr's Geol. N. C, App., 12, pi. 2, f. 28), with a reference to 

 Gabb's description and figure of Alaria rostrata. It is an entirely 

 different species from the one described by Gabb, having an expanded 

 lip like that figured by me (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., 1898, p. 463, f. 3), 

 the entire lip showing one or two small projections below. Whether 

 the form figured by Conrad or the one figured by Whitfield (pi. 14, 

 figs. 7, 8) is the R. pennata of Morton I am unable to say.

A CONTKIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORTHOPTERA OF SOUTH 

 AND CENTRAL FLORIDA. 



BY JA^IES A. G. REHX AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



The material on which the following study is based is almost entirely 

 the property of the junior author, the greater portion having been 

 collected by him on trips taken in the months of January and February, 

 1903 and 1904. The localities represented are Tampa, Hillsboro 

 county; Chokoloskee and Key West, Mom-oe county; and Miami, Dade 

 county. 



The specimens examined number 783, the species seventy-eight, of 

 which seven are new, and several Cuban types are here recorded from 

 the United States for the first time. A A^ery representative series of 

 the material has been presented to the Acadenw. 



The field notes given after the species are entirely the work of the 

 junior author, and are followed by the initial of his name. The brief 

 descriptions of the localities visited, with other facts of interest from 

 the standpoint of this paper, are also by him. 



Tampa, Hillsboro County, Florida. 



During my brief stay in Tampa (January 16 and 17, 1904) I had 

 time for only a few expeditions, and found that from the Tampa Bay 

 Hotel good collecting grounds were not easy to reach. Chilly weather 

 also hampered me decidedly, as in South Florida the weather had been 

 so cool that Orthoptcra was scarce, except in the most sheltered places. 

 There are many marshy spots along the shore of Tampa Bay, and in 

 these few specimens of Orthoptera were to be found. In the driftwood 

 along the shore I also captured a few Forficulids and Blattids, and 

 noticed a small cricket of a pale straw color which I was unable to 

 capture. Back from the bay the country is flat, and for the greater 

 part open with frec^uent shallow ponds, around the edges of which the 

 grasses grow rank, and in these I took numerous specimens. The 

 occasional woods of scattering pines proved unproductive at this time 

 of year, but along their borders the dead pine stumps yielded a number 

 of Eurycotis floridana. A vacant lot near the hotel yielded in addition 

 a few specimens of Ncmohius. 




30 proceedings of the academy of [jan., 



Key West, Monroe County, Florida. 



I arrived at Key West on January 18, at 4 P.M., and loft on the 20th, 

 but during this time I collected every spare moment, and although the 

 Key was dry and a high wind kept the white coquina dust flying in 

 clouds, collecting proved quite productive. During the fall months 

 the collecting must be of the best. 



Key West is one of the numerous small islands off the Florida coast, 

 and is situated on the edge of the Gulf Stream, ninety miles northeast 

 of Havana, Cuba. The surface of the Key is composed almost wholly 

 of coquina and is perfectly flat. The greater part is covered with a 

 dense scrub growing to a height of from fifteen to twenty feet, in which 

 very few Orthoptera could be found. The lagoons extending along 

 parts of the shore were also improductive, but there are a few portions 

 of the island near tlie city where the country is more open and the 

 scrub is interspersed with occasional gumbo-limbo trees, and in such 

 location the collecting was excellent. Here not only was Acrididas 

 abundant in the grass, but I also found the Blattidse and Forficulidse 

 abundantly represented under the loose chunks of coquina. 



I noticed many immature Gonatista grisea scurrying about on the 

 gumbo-limbo trees, and at their roots captured several Anisomorpha 

 buprcstoides. Here and there are small shallow ponds, around the 

 edges of which peculiar weeds flourish on the bare coquina. 



Miami, Dade County, Florida. 



I spent several weeks in Miami in the winter of 1903, but did no 

 collecting of any importance in Orthoptera until February, 1904, when 

 I was there from February 5 to February 9, and found Orthoptera 

 plentiful. Near the town there are four different localities in which to 

 collect: the thick jungle or "hammock," the open pine woods, the salt 

 marshes, and the Everglades. In the "hammock" most insects are 

 abundant, but Orthoptera are scarce. I took several species here on 

 the weeds, under the bark of the oaks, and in the small open spaces. 

 The open pine woods are filled with Orthoptera, and many species 

 were to be found among the low vegetation and pine needles. 



The dead pine logs, upon their bark being peeled off, also disclosed 

 several interesting species. These pine woods extend along Biscayne 

 Bay between the Everglades and the "hammocks" along the shore. 

 The salt marshes are to be found here and there along the shore of the 

 bay, but are quite distant from the hotel, and owing to the shortness 

 of my stay I was unable to visit them. The Everglades are so difficult 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 31 



to penetrate that I found it impossible to collect there. Along their 

 edge no Orthoptera could be found. Many species of Orthoptera were 

 to be heard in the grounds of the Hotel Roj^al Palm after dark, and I 

 made a number of interesting captures there. 



During the summer of 1903, Mr. W. S. Dickinson collected for me 

 in this locality and reported Orthoptera to be scarce in most places. 



The material from Chokoloskee, Monroe county, was purchased, 

 and therefore I can give no notes for it. 



Family FORFIOULID^. 

 labidura bidens (Olivier). 



A single small male of this species is contained in the Miami collec- 

 tion, taken July 11, 1903. It is considerably smaller and lighter than 

 males from Thomasville, Georgia, and has the anal segment almost 

 unarmed. 



Anisolabis maritima (Bon.). 



A female of this species from Key West, taken January 19, 1904, and 

 another from Miami, taken February 9, 1904, have been examined. 



Key West. — This specimen was taken from under a coquina boulder, 

 which also disclosed a number of Ariisolabis annulipes. (H.) 



Miayni. — Taken from a stone w^all. (H.) 

 Anisolabis annulipes (H. Lucas). 



A series of fifty-three specimens from Miami taken during the sum- 

 mer of 1903, and a Key West series of nineteen taken January 19, 1904, 

 represent this species. Considerable variation exists in the width and 

 intensity of the femoral annuli, and in some specimens they are almost 

 wholly lacking. 



Key West. — All of these specimens were taken from under coquina 

 boulders along a new road being built on the outskirts of the town. 

 They were found several at a time, often in company with one or two 

 large scorpions. (H.) 



Labia burgessii Scudder. 



Nine specimens from Tampa, taken January 17, 1904, and fourteen 

 from Miami, taken February 6, 1904, are identical with specimens from 

 Thomasville, Georgia, 



Specimens from both localities were taken from under the bark 

 of dead pine logs, those from Miami all being taken from the same 

 log. (H,) 



Labia guttata Scudder. 



A single female of this species was taken at Tampa, January 17, 1904, 




32 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Taken from under a sign on an oak in company with a number of 

 Periplaneta australasicc . (H.) 



Family BLATTID^. 

 Blattella germanioa (Linureus). 



Four specimens of this species from ]\Iiami have been examined. 

 Blattella adspersicollis (Stal). 



Four specimens of this West Intlian and tropical American species 

 have been examined from Miami, taken February 6, 1903, and Febru- 

 ary 1, 1904. This is the first record of the species within the United 

 States. 



The specimen captured on February 6, 1903, I took on the porch of 

 the Hotel Royal Palm in the early morning. All the others w^ere found 

 under signs on the pine trees in the town. (H.) 



Ceratinoptera lutea Saussure and Zehntner. 



An adult was taken at Tampa, in the driftwood along the shore of 

 Tampa Bay, on January 17, 1904, and one in Key West on January 20, 

 1904. The specimen taken at Tampa was so recently emerged from 

 the larval state that it had not then become hardened. (H.) 



Temnopteryx deropeltiformis Brunner. 



An adult female of this species was taken at Miami on the 5th of 

 August, 1903. This record considerably extends the range of the 

 species, Indiana being the only State from which it has previously 

 been recorded. Brunner's original description merely credited the 

 species to North America. 



Eurycotis floridana (Walker). 



This ill-smelling species is represented liy a series of twenty-eight 

 individuals in all stages of development, thirteen being adult. Tampa 

 specimens were taken January 16, 1904; Key West individuals on 

 January IS and 19, 1904; and ]\Iiami representatives on Feliruary 6, 

 1904, and July 1 and August 11, 1903. 



The greater portion of the immature individuals are of the sabaliana 

 type, with the lateral margins light-colored. In some specimens this is 

 quite marked, in others very obscure, and in a number absent; two 

 adults are noteworthy as retaining indistinct traces of this early color 

 pattern. 



I found this species moderately common under the bark of dead pine 

 stumps and logs both at Tampa and Miami. In Key West it fairly 

 swarmed under the coquina boulders in the woods, one rock often 

 disclosing a dozen, the greater part immature but ranging from tiny 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 33 



young to huge females bearing large oothecse. All would immediately 

 scuttle away, making a rustling sound in the loose pebbles. When 

 seized these insects emit a vile-smelling oily fluid.- The females always 

 produced far more of this than the males. (H.) 



Periplaneta americana (Linnaeus). 



This species is represented by an adult female and four immature 

 individuals taken at Tampa, January 17, 1904. 

 Periplaneta australasise (Fabricius). 



Three adults from Miami, taken July 11 and 21 and August 23, 1903, 

 and three adults and seven nymphs taken at Tampa, January 17, 1904, 

 represent this species. 



All the specimens from Tampa were taken from under a tin sign on 

 an oak tree. (H.) 

 Pycnoscelus surinamensis (Linnsus). 



This tropical species is represented by a scries of sixty-four adult and 

 immature specimens. But one specimen was taken at Tampa, a. 

 nymph, on January 17, 1904, and it would appear from this that the 

 species is not so common that far north. Miami is represented by 

 specimens taken in January, February and during the summer, while 

 Key West individuals were all (fourteen in number) taken January 

 19 and 20, 1904. 



I have always found this species plentiful at ]\Iiami under stones 

 and rubbish. In Key West it was very abundant under coquina boul- 

 ders in the woods. I have noticed that they usually attempt to escape 

 by burrowing. (H.) 



Plectoptera poeyi (Saussure). 



This Cuban type is represented by a series of eight specimens taken 

 at Key West on January 19, 1904. These specimens are the first of 

 the species with exact data recorded from the United States. 



Family MANTIDJE. 

 Stagmomantis Carolina (Jolianuson). 



One immature female, beaten from scrub at Key West on January 

 20, 1904, belongs to this species. Several males were taken at Miami 

 on February 4, 1903, attracted to light. 



^ Gonatista grisea (Fabricius). 



Six immature individuals from Key West, January 19, 1904, and 

 one from Miami, February 6, 1904, are referable to this species. 



Key West. — The immature specimens of this species were abundant 

 upon the trunks of the gumbo-limbo trees. They ran about with

great swiftness, but when resting pressed themselves close to the bark, 

 which they exactly resembled. 



Miami. — I found a few immature specimens on the trunk of a tree 

 in a swampy spot near the Miami river. (H.) 

 Thesprotia graminis (Scudder). 



This species is represented by an immature specimen from Tampa, 

 taken January 17, 1904, another from Key West, taken January 18, 

 1904, and six mature or nearly mature individuals from Miami, taken 

 in February, March, July and August. 



I have usually found this species in the pine straw of the pine woods, 

 which it so closely resembles as to be invisible when stationary. (H.) 



Family PHASMID^. 

 Anisomorpha buprestoides (Stoll). 



Three specimens of this species were taken at Key West on January 

 19, 1904, and one adult has been examined from Miami, taken August 

 5, 1903. 



Specimens from Key West were taken from among the roots of 

 gumbo-limbo trees. A pair taken on January 19 were in coitu. (H.) 



Family AORIDID^. 

 Apotettix minutus n. sp. (PI. I, flgs. 3 and 4). 



Type : c? ; Miami, Dade county, Florida. February 6, 1904. Col- 

 lected by Morgan Hebard. 



Allied to A. rugosus (Scudder), but very considerably smaller, with 

 the median carina of the pronotum very slightly depressed between 

 the humeral angles, the margins of the median femora scarcely undu- 

 late and the pul villi of the caudal metatarsi of subequal length.

 occiput ascending; vertex not elevated above the level of the eyes; 

 fastigium subtruncate, very slightly wider than one of the eyes, dis- 

 tinctl}^ excavated laterad, cephalic margin distinctly carinate and 

 romided in toward the median carina; median carina of fastigium dis- 

 tinct, extending back to the middle of the eyes and projecting cephalad 

 beyond the margin of the fastigium ; frontal costa slightly and regu- 

 larly divergent to the median ocellus, ventrad of which it is absent; 

 eyes moderately prominent, slightly ovate in outline. Pronotum pro-* 

 duccd, surpassing the tips of the caudal femora; median carina dis-

 late; caudal angle of the lateral lobes somewhat recurved, elytral and 

 ventral sinus deep and angulate. Tegmina elliptical, the apex acute. 

 Wings extending beyond the caudal process of the pronotum a distance 

 equal to the length of the cephalic femora. Cephalic femora with the 

 dorsal carina quite distinct but not very high, the lower margin slightly 

 arcuate, but not undulate. Median femora with the margins very 

 slightly undulate, the dorsal more so than the ventral. Caudal femora 

 quite robust, inflated, femoral lobe rectangulate and not elevated, 

 external pagina and dorso-lateral face with strong diagonal folds;

The t}'pe is the only specimen of the species which has been exam- 

 ined. 



This specimen was taken near the south bank of the Miami river, in 

 a damp spot in the ''hammock." The exact locality is about one 

 hundred yards downstream from the first bridge. (H.) 



Tettigidea lateralis (Say). 



This species was taken at Miami, February 6, 1903. 



Badinotatnm brevipenne (Thomas). 



This species apparently does not occur on Key West, as no specimens 

 were taken. Tampa is represented by sixteen specimens taken on 

 January 17, 1904, while thirteen specimens from Miami were taken on 

 January 29 and 31 and February 3, 1903, February 6 and 9, 1904, and 

 July 28, 1904. Several of the adult females arc of vciy large size. 

 The usual color forms are represented in the series. 



Specimens from Tampa were all taken in the grasses bordering the 

 shallow ponds. Those from Miami were taken in the wire-grass and 

 undergrowth of the pine woods. (H.) 



Tmxalis brevicornis (Johannson). 



A single male from Chokoloskee represents this species. 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Syrbula admirabilis (Uhler). 



A^single female of this species was taken at Miami on September 1, 

 1903. It is very much larger than specimens from the Northern States, 

 measuring forty-five millimeters in length of body. 

 Macneillia obscura (Scudder). 



. A series of eighteen specimens — six adult males, six adult females, six 

 nymphs — from Miami were taken February 6 and 9, 1904. They 

 represent both color phases, the green and the brown, the latter pre- 

 dominating, and including all except one adult female and one nymph. 

 The green female has the dorsal half of the latter lobes of the pronotum, 

 the face except the costal region and the dorsal face of the caudal 

 femora grass green, the remainder of the surface being colored much as 

 in the brown phase. 



Five nymphs from Tampa, taken on Januar}'- 17, 1904, were also 

 examined. 



I found these specimens in the wire-grass of the pine woods, over a 

 mile from town on the Everglades road. All the specimens were taken 

 within a few yards of each other, and diligent search failed to reveal 

 others in the surrounding woods. The females were easily captured, 

 but the males sprang about with alacrity. (H.) 

 Amblytropidia oocidentalis (Saussure). 



Thirteen specimens of this species have been examined : three taken 

 at Miami, February 7 and 9, 1904; eight at Cape Florida, Biscayne Key, 

 February 8, 1904; one at Tampa, January 17, 1904, and one at Choko- 

 loskce. 

 Orpbulella pratorum Scudder. 



A series of twenty-two specimens from Key West, taken January 18, 

 19 and 20, 1904, and seven individuals from Miami, taken in July and 

 August, 1903, represents this species. 



Dichromorpha viridis (Scudder). 



Eight Tampa specimens, taken January 16 and 17, 1904, and one 

 Chokoloskee individual represent this species. Both color phases are 

 present.

Allied to C. elegans Morse, but readily distinguished by the larger 

 size, longer tegmina and more brilliant coloration in the green phase. 



Size large (for the genus) ; form moderately slender. Head with the

occiput with a hardly perceptible elevation; vertex sloping very 

 slightly toward the fastigiimi; interocular space almost twice as wide 

 as the frontal costa in the male and about once and a half the width 

 in the female; fastigium moderately produced, rectangulate, with a 

 distinct semicircular excavation, margins distinctly elevated, no me- 

 dian carina present; face distinctly retreating; frontal costa slightly 

 and gradually expanding, reaching to the clypeus, sulcate through the 

 entire length; eyes ovoid, in the male very decidedly longer than in 

 infra-ocular portion of the genae, in the female slightly longer than the 

 same ; antennae distinctly longer ( c? ) or considerably shorter ( 9 ) than 

 the head and pronotum. Pronotum subequal in the male, slightly 

 expanding caudad in the female, lateral carinse very slightly constricted 

 mesad; medium carina as distinct as the lateral; cephahc margin 

 rotund ato-trunc ate, caudal margin very broadly obtuse-angulate, 

 more rounded in the male than in the female ; transverse sulcus sever- 

 ing the median carina distinctly behind the middle ; lateral lobes of the 

 pronotum with the ventral margin very broadly obtuse-angulate. 

 Tegmina falling slightly short of the apex of the abdomen, apex slightly 

 narrowed and rotundato-truncate ; costal area with the proximal lobe 

 very prominent, ulnar area of the male with about eight distinct trans- 

 verse veins. Abdomen with the subgenital plate of the male produced 

 into a distinct tubercle; cerci straight, simple, tapering. Cephalic 

 and median femora of the male somewhat inflated. Caudal femora 

 exceeding the apex of the abdomen by nearly the length of the head, 

 moderately robust, distal portion slender with the genicular region 

 enlarged; tibise with thirteen or fourteen spines on the lateral margin 

 in the male and sixteen in the female. 



Male above apple green; sides and limbs cinnamon, shading to wood 

 brown on the lower surface, eyes and a distinct brownish-black post- 

 ocular streak which also suffuses the base of the tegmina; tegmina 

 (except for the green anal area) pale drab; antennae cinnamon, 

 slightly infuscate apically; dorsal carina of the lateral face of the 

 caudal femora olive ; lateral carinae of the pronotum narrowly lined 

 with cinnamon. 



Female with the sides, face and limbs apple green; postocular streak 

 as in the male ; head above centrally apple green, flanked by bars of 

 vinaceous-ruf ous ; pronotum above vinaceous-rufous; tegmina with 

 the costal area apple green, the continuations of the postocular streak

Length of caudal femora, 12.5 " 17.5 " 



A series of five males and three females of this beautiful species have 

 been examined, all taken at Miami on July 20, 1903, except the female 

 type. The males are all uniformly colored except for the presence of a 

 median broad blackish longitudinal bar on the head, a character not 

 noticeable in the type, very distinct in two and faintly indicated in 

 two others. The females, however, exhibit a great color diversity, the 

 type representing one form; another is dull brown with little or no 

 contrasts, in fact resembling the coloration of Amblytro'pidia occiden- 

 talis; the third is cinnamon-rufous on the head and pronotum, with 

 the usual postocular streak, while the tegmina are a very delicate 

 pinkish without any longitudinal bar. 

 Arphia granulata Saussure. 



This quite distinct species is represented by a series of four from 

 Chokoloskee, two from Miami, taken February 6, 1903, and Februar}^ 

 7, 1904, and four from Key West, taken January 20, 1904. Three of 

 this series are females, and two of them from Chokoloskee are of a 

 decided blackish hue. 



Key West. — I found this species in a few sunny openings in the 

 scrub at the eastern end of the Key. 



Miami. — Specimens were taken in pine woods near the town. (H.) 

 Chortophaga viridifasoiata (DeGeer), 



A series of thirty-seven specimens represents this common and 

 widely distributed species. Miami specimens were taken in January, 

 February and July; Key West individuals on the 18th and 19th of 

 January, 1904; Tampa is represented by three specimens taken Janu- 

 ary 16 and 17, 1904. Four specimens are from Chokoloskee. 

 Dissosteira Carolina (Linuseus). 



One female from Chokoloskee, 



Scirtetica picta (Scudder). 



This beautiful species is apparently rather common at Miami in 

 July, sixteen specimens taken on the 20th having been examined. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



Two specimens taken there on February 6, 1904, were also studied. 

 The hoary suffusion so noticeable in the species of this genus is limited 

 in some individuals, and more general in others, very much as in the 

 closely related S. marmorata. 



In a few places in the pine woods this species was plentiful, but speci- 

 mens were hard to capture on account of their extreme shyness. (H.) 



Psinidia fenestralis (Serville). 



This sand-loving species is represented by a series of sixteen speci- 

 mens, taken at Chokoloskee, and Miami on February 6. 1904, and July 

 20, 1903. As a rule they are darker than northern specimens, and have 

 the transverse bars on the lateral aspects of the caudal femora more 

 pronounced. 



Dictyophorus guttatus (Stoll). 



This striking species is represented by four specimens taken at Miami 

 on July 11, 1903, and June 2, 1899, the latter collected by Dr. H. A. 

 Pilsbry, and in the collection of the Academy. A number of specimens 

 have also been examined from Chokoloskee, Tarpon Springs, Hillsboro 

 county (November, 1903), and Good all, Volusia county (August). 



Pseudopomala brachyptera (Scudder). 



A single adult female of this species from Chokoloskee has been 

 examined. This is the first record of this species from the Southern 

 States, 



Stenacris chlorizans Walker. 



This water-loving species is represented by a single individual from 

 Miami, taken January 30, 1903. A specimen from St. Augustine, in 

 the collection of the Academy, has also been examined. 

 Leptysma marginicollis (Serville). 



This elusive species is no doubt of regular occurrence in suitable 

 localities, ten specimens having been examined from Chokoloskee, 

 Tampa (January 17, 1904), Miami (January 16, 23, and February 2, 

 1899; S. N. Rhoads), and De Funiak Springs, Walton county (Febru- 

 ary 20; C. W. Johnson). All the specimens have the lateral lines 

 distinct. 



Specimens from Tampa were taken in the marshy places along the 

 bay. (H.) 

 ScMstocerca americana (Drury). 



This powerful species is represented by a series of thirteen Key West 

 specimens taken on January 18 and 19, 1904, two females from Cape 

 Florida, February 8, 1904, a single Chokoloskee individual and_a'series 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



of ten from Miami taken in July, 1903, and February, 1904. January 

 specimens from Miami are also in the Academy collection. 



Schistocerca damnifica (Saussure). 



A male from Miami taken February G, 1904, and a female from 

 Chokoloskee represent this species. 

 Schistocerca alutacea (Harris). 



Three males, two from Key West, January 20, 1904, and one from 

 Chokoloskee, represent this species. The Kej' West individuals are 

 rather uniformly colored, while the Chokoloskee specimen is striped. 



Key West. — These specimens were taken in the open bush near the 

 city. (H.) 



ScMstocerca obscura (Fabricius). 



One male from Miami taken August 12, 1903, is referred to this 

 species. 



Melanoplus puer (Scuddei). 



Twenty-nine specimens represent this peculiar species, several 

 being immature and the adults all larger than Scudder's measurements. 

 One individual is from Tampa, while the remainder are from Miami, 

 taken February 6, 7 and 9, 1904. The species was previously known 

 only from Fort Reed, Orange county, and Jacksonville, Duval county. 



Tampa. — The specimen from Tampa was taken in a grassy spot 

 near the railroad. 



Miami. — ^These specimens were taken in the undergrowth of the 

 pine w^oods both to the north and the west of the town. (H.) 

 Melanoplus keeleri (Thomas). 



A series of twenty-six individuals, evenly divided between the sexes, 

 represent this species. All are from Miami, taken in July and August, 

 1903. 



Some of the male specimens have the cerci typical of keeleri, while 

 others might with justice be referred to deletor, and it appears very 

 possible that the two species are identical. The series examined can- 

 not be separated by the cerci into two forms, one extreme running into 

 the other, while in all other characters no difference exists. The series 

 exhibits a considerable amount of color variation, and in size both 

 sexes are larger than Scudder's measurements. 

 Paroxya floridiana (Thomas). 



A male and a female from Miami, taken July 17, 1903, and January 

 23, 1899, and three females from Chokoloskee represent this species. 

 Paroxya atlantica Scudder. 



A series of fifty-five males and twenty-six females represents this 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41 



species. Miami individuals were taken in February, July and August; 

 Cape Florida specimens (two) on February 8, 1904; Tampa individuals 

 (two) on January 17, 1904, and the Key West series on January 19, 

 1904. Chokoloskco is represented by a number of specimens without 

 data. Many of the males are extremely small, and the Key West 

 series (twenty-six in number) is remarkable on account of the distinct 

 bars on the posterior femora, a feature not very marked on specimens 

 from other localities. The same series appears somewhat smaller than 

 the mainland representatives, especially the females, and possibly 

 may be an insular race worthy of separation. 



Those taken in Tampa and Miami were found in marshy spots, 

 while those from Cape Florida and Key West were found on dry ground 

 among weeds. (H.) 



Aptenopedes olara Rehn. 



This beautiful species is represented by a series of forty-one speci- 

 mens exhibiting a great amount of variation in size, and considerable 

 in color. A topotypic series from Miami were taken on February 6 and 

 7, 1904, and in July, 1903, while Key West is represented by twelve 

 specimens indistinguishable from the types, and taken on January 19 

 and 20, 1904. Several individuals from Cape Florida, Key Biscayne, 

 taken February S, 1904, are of enormous size, but cannot be separated 

 otherwise from the types. Eight specimens from Tampa, taken Janu- 

 ary 16 and 17, 1904, have the cerci slightly shorter and less falcate 

 than in Miami specimens, but the fiu-cula are as in true clara, and the 

 tendency toward sphenarioides is extremely slight. The range in total 

 length of adult males is from 19 millimeters in Miami specimens to 

 26.5 in the Cape Florida type, in adult females from 24 in small Miami 

 specimens to 34 in the largest Cape Florida representatives. 



The brown phase of coloration has been noticed in the female only, 

 the male presenting little else than variation in the intensity of the 

 green phase of coloration. 



The specimens from Tampa were taken in marshy spots along the 

 bay. In Key West I found the species among the low, dry herbage 

 near the city, and on Cape Florida in a dense tangle of vines and grasses. 

 Those from Miami were captured in the vmdergrowth of the pine 

 woods. (H.) 



Aptenopedes aptera Scudder. 



Folu- males of this species taken at Miami, February 7, 1904, have 

 b®en examined. The caudal femora of this species appear heavier 

 than in any of the other species of the genus. 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



These specimens were taken in the wire-grass of the pine woods to 

 the north of Miami. Specimens were very hard to find here, and none 

 were taken to the west of the town where, otherwise, the best collect- 

 ing was secured. (H.) 



Family TETTIGONID^. 

 Stilpnoohlora marginella (Serville). 



A single female specimen of this neotropical species from Chokoloskee 

 has been examined. It is slightly smaller than a Nicaraguan female 

 in the Academy collection, but can without hesitancy be referred to 

 this species. Scudder has recorded it from the Florida Keys. 



Soudderia curvioauda (DeGeer). 



A single female of this species was taken at Miami on July 20, 1903. 



Soudderia ouneata Morse. 



A pair of this southern species was taken at Miami on August 21 (c?) 

 and 23 ( ? ), 1903.

Allied to A. ohlongifolia, but differing in the straighter ovipositor 

 and less angulatc lateral angles of the disk of the pronotum. From 

 A. huasteca, which it resembles in the latter respect, it can be separated 

 by the very much shorter ovipositor. 



Size medium; form slender, elongate. Head short, rather broad; 

 vertex very strongly declivent; fastigium of the vertex very broad, 

 about equal to the length of one of the eyes, truncate, broadly touching 

 the frontal fastigium; eyes elliptical; antennae reaching to the tips of 

 the wings. Pronotum depressed above, distinctly expanding poste- 

 riorly; lateral margins of the disk rounded rectangulate, ratner obso- 

 lete cephalad; cephalic margin with a broad slight median emargina- 

 tion, caudal margin broadly rotundate; lateral lobes slightly deeper

This interesting species is represented by a series of five specimens, 

 three females, two males, all of which are in bad condition, three having 

 lost the caudal limbs. The specimens other than the types are all 

 from Chokoloskce, Florida. 

 Miorocentrum laurifolium (LiniiiBus). 



Two specimens, male and female, from Miami represent this species 

 in the Hebard collection. They were taken on February 5 and Sep- 

 tember 12. A single female, in the collection of the Academy, was 

 taken at Miami on February 1, 1899, by S. N. and M. C. Rhoads, and 

 another male at Braidentown^ Manatee county. 



Many specimens of this species could be heard stridulating in the 

 trees after dark, but were difficult to capture. (H.) 



Microcentrum rostratum n. sp. (PI. I, figs. G and 7). 



Type: ? ; Miami, Dade county, Florida. March 16, 1903. [Heb-

Allied to M. lucidum Brunner, from Brazil, from wh^'ch it differs in 

 the triangularly produced mcso- and metasternal lobes, and the less 

 rotundate character of the tegmina. The new form can readily be 

 distinguished from the other North American species by its much 

 smaller size and the peculiar fastigium. 



Size small; form as usual in the genus. Head but slightly punctate 

 dorsad; occiput and vertex deplanate, moderately declivent; fasti-

 rounded and not as wide as the proximal joint of the antennae; frontal 

 fastigium much narrower than the fastigium of the vertex and touching 

 the same ; eyes subspherical, moderately prominent, slightly depressed, 

 separated from one another by a space equal to the length of one of 

 them; antcnnse with the proximal joint subquadrate in section, rather 

 small. Pronotum strongly punctate, depressed above, the lateral 

 angles distinct, rectangulate, more apparent cephalad than caudad; 

 cephalic margin very broadly and shallowly emarginate, caudal margin 

 strongly arcuate ; lateral lobes distinctly deeper than long, the ventral 

 margin with an oblique cephalic sinuosity, a distinct humeral sinus pres- 

 ent. Tcgmina of the type usual in the genus, strongly punctate and 

 coriaceous, the veins not pronounced; anterior ulnar vein becoming 

 obsolete distad, the median vein reaching the sutural margin proximad 

 of the apex, mediastine vein very short; apex narrowly rounded. 

 Wings extending beyond the tegmina a distance slightly less than the 

 length of the pronotum. Mcsosternal and metasternal lobes produced 

 caudad, the angles sharp. Cephahc femora with the ventral cephalic 

 margin distinctly spined; tibiae unspined above. Median femora 

 armed as with the cephalic pair. Caudal femora short, hardly exceed- 

 ing the tip of the ovipositor, ventral margins spined; tibiae slightly

 Both are of a brownish color, which apparently is the natural coloration. 

 The tcgmina and wings are present as very small pads. 



Pyrgocorypha uncinata (Harris). 



This striking species is represented by four specimens, two from 

 Miami, one taken July 11, 1903 (immature), the other without date, 

 and two from Chokoloskee. They agree very well with Mexican 

 specimens. 



Conooeplialus mexicanus Saussure. 



Three specimens represent this species, one from Tampa, taken 

 January 15, 1904, the others from Miami, taken February 5, 1903, and 

 February 6, 1904. 



Tampa. — I took this specimen in a marshy spot on the shore of 

 Tampa Bay. 



Miami. — One specimen was captured in a bush about 9 P.M. It 

 was making a deafening noise. I saw and heard several other speci- 

 mens, but all these when approached flew swiftly aw^ay. 



Conocephalus lyristes n. sp. (PI. I, figs. 8 and 9). 



Type: 6^, Chokoloskee, Monroe county, Florida. [Hebard collec- 

 tion,] 



Apparently allied to Conocephalus truncatirostris Redtenbacher from 

 Brazil, C. exiliscanorus Davis from Staten Island, and C. bruneri 

 Blatchley from Indiana. From the former it can readily be distin- 

 guished by the slenderer head and smaller size, while the shape of the 

 fastigium will separate it from the latter species. 



Size medium; form rather slender and moderately compressed. 

 Head v/ith the occiput and vertex horizontal, the rostrum elongate 

 and produced into a rather slender, bluntly rounded process which is 

 distinctly longer than the interspace between the eyes, ventral surface 

 with a blunt basal tooth; frontal fastigium produced, but not quite 

 touching the process of the rostrum; eyes rounded ovate in outline, not 

 very prominent. Pronotum deplanate dorsad; lateral angles not dis- 

 tinct cephalad, distinct but rounded caudad; cephalic margin subtrun- 

 cate, caudal margin broadly arcuate; lateral lobes equally long and 

 broad, the ventral margin obtuse-angulatc, humeral sinus rather broad 

 and shallow. Tegmina long and narrow, very considerably surpassing 

 the caudal femora. Cerci thick, heavy and parallel, apically with a 

 strong, recurved, aculeate spine on the internal margin, dorsad of which 

 is placed another of similar character but smaller size; subgenital plate 

 with a broad apical V-shaped emargination and with short but distinct

styles. Cephalic femora unarmed, tibiae with the perforation a mere 

 slit on each face. Median limbs slightly larger than the cephalic pair. 

 Caudal femora no longer than the body, slender, genicular lobes spini- 

 form, the internal more distinctly produced than the external, distal 

 portion of the ventral margins spined ; tibiae heavy, straight and rather 

 strongly spined. 



General color tawny olive; head with a lateral line on the rostrum, 

 the ocelli and a narrow postocular line ochre yellow, eye drab, ventral 

 surface of the rostrum black ; pronotum with the lateral angles marked 

 with ochre yellow, another bar of the same color and a continuation of 

 the postocular line crosses the lateral lobes; tegmina with the radial 

 veins and the sides of the tympanum marked with blackish, a number 

 of rather faint maculations of the same color being distributed over the 

 tegmina, lateral margins of the tympanum external to the blackish bar 

 striped with ochre yellow; limb with the ventral surfaces blackish, 

 rather weak on the cephalic pair, very distinct and extending on to the 

 lateral aspects of the tibite on the caudal pair.

The type is the only adult specimen examined . An immature female 

 from Chokoloskce appears to belong to this species. The ovipositor 

 is very considerably longer than the body, slightly decurved with an 

 acute apex. 



Conocephalus hoplomachus n. sp. (PI. I, figs. 10 and 11). 



Type: 9 ; Chokoloskee, Monroe county, Florida. May. [He bard 

 collection.] 



Apparently allied to C. ensifer Bolivar from Peru, but differing in the 

 short and acuminate tegmina and wings. The blunt, broad fastigium 

 short, sublanceolate tegmina, and straight elongate ovipositor will at 

 once distinguish this species. 



Size large; form robust, limbs short. Head somewhat depressed, 

 subdeplanate dorsad, occiput and vertex horizontal; rostrum moder- 

 ately produced, extending beyond the cephalic margin of the eyes a

distance slightly less than the interocular space, apex rotund ato-trun- 

 cate, rounded and with no distinct angles; frontal fastigium broadly 

 touching the blunt ventral process of the rostrum; eyes subovate, 

 small, not prominent. Pronotum broad, rather deplanate dorsad, no 

 distinct lateral angles, a slightly marked shoulder developed over the 

 humeral sinus; cephalic margin truncate with a very faint median 

 emargination ; caudal margin truncate; lateral lobes distinctly longer 

 than deep, ventral margin rounded with a faint median obtuse angle, 

 humeral sinus distinct but not deep. Tegmina not reaching the apex 

 of the abdomen, sublanceolate, the apex very narrowly rounded; 

 longitudinal veins indistinct and almost lost in the irregular, reticulate 

 character of the cross veins, mediastine veins extending almost half 

 the length of the tegmen, median vein closely pressed to the posterior 

 radial vein and extending to the extreme apex, anterior ulnar vein 

 distinctly longitudinal in disposition and distad parallel and placed close 

 to the median vein. Wings considerably shorter than the tegmina. 

 Ovipositor very long, broad and with a hardly perceptible curve, the 

 length being almost equal to that of the body and nearly twice that of 

 the caudal femora, apex very acute; subgenital plate narrowed toward 

 the apical margin, apex triangularly emarginate. Cephalic femora 

 short, with two spines on the distal portion of the interno-vcntral 

 margin, tibiae with the aperture slit-like. Median limbs about equal 

 to the cephalic in size. Caudal femora slightly exceeding the apex of 

 the abdomen, apical portion not very slender, both ventral margins 

 spined distad, genicular lobes distinctly spined. 



General color cinnamon, two faint longitudinal lines of umber present 

 on the sides of the disk of the pronotum.

The type only has been examined. 

 Conocephalus retusus Scudder. 



A single female from Chokoloskee is referred to this species. This 

 species has never before been recorded south of Georgia. 

 Orchelimum vulgare Harris. 



A pair of this species from Chokoloskee has been examined. 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Orchelimum concinnum Scudder. 



A female from Chokoloskee is the most southern record for this 

 species, whose general range is more western. 



Orchelimum nitidum Redteubacher. 



A male individual from Chokoloskee probably belongs to this species, 

 differing from the description in several details, which, however, appear 

 to be unimportant. 



Xiphidion gracillimum Morse. 



A scries of fourteen specimens, nine males and five females, repre- 

 sents this beautiful species. Miami adult specimens were taken on 

 January 30, July 17-20 and September 12, 1903, immature specimens 

 on Februar}^ 6 and 8, 1904. A single immature male from Tampa 

 was taken January 16, 1904. Considerable variation is exhibited in 

 the intensity of the dorsal stripe. The type series of the species was 

 taken at Capron and Biscayne Bay. 



All specimens of this species which I captured were found among 

 dense weeds. (H.) 

 Xiphidion brevipenne Scudder. 



This widely distributed species is represented by one female taken 

 at Chokoloskee. 

 Atlanticus sp. 



Fourteen immatiu-c specimens belonging to a species of this genus 

 were taken at Miami on February 6 and 9, 1904, and at Tampa on 

 January 17, 1904. They apparently are not gibbosus, but are quite 

 different from the other species of the genus. 



Ceuthophilus latibuli Scudder. 



A series of eleven specimens of both sexes represents this richly 

 colored species. They were taken at Enterprise, Volusia county, 

 April 18, 1903, by Mr. Philip Laurent. The species was described 

 from Crescent Ciw, Florida, and Georgia. 



Mr. Laurent informs me that this species is found abundantly in 

 gopher holes. In one hole which he dug out the whole of the 

 bottom of the burrow was covered with them. (H.) 



Family G-RYLLID^. 

 Mogoplistes slossoni Scudder. 



A female specimen of this species, which is considerably smaller than 

 the type measurements and apparently immature, was taken at Miami, 

 February 6, 1904. The antennae have four distinct blackish annuli 

 on a chestnut ground. 




1905.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 49 



I took this specimen under a sign on an oak tree in the "hammock" 

 just across the river from Miami. One other specimen was noticed, 

 but escaped by springing from the tree. Great difficulty was experi- 

 enced in capturing the specimen without rubbing off its silver scales. 

 (H.) 



Liphoplus krugii Saussnre. 



This species was originally described from Cuba, and has never since 

 been recorded outside of that island. Seven specimens, one male, six 

 females, taken at Key West, January 19, 1904, appear to be referable 

 to this form. 



These specimens were taken from Ilex cassine by beating, in company 

 with Plectopiera poeyi and Cyrtoxipha delicatula. The specimens were 

 all secured with little difficulty. (H.) 



Liphoplus zebra n. sp. (PI. I, fig. li). 



Type : d^ ; Miami, Dade county, Florida. February 6, 1904. (Mor- 

 gan Hebard.) [Hebard collection.] 



Distinguished from L. krugii by the apparent tegmina, the smaller 

 size and peculiar coloration. 



Size very small; form depressed; surface partially, and probably 

 wholly in the perfect unabradcd insect, covered with minute scales of 

 a silvery-white color. Head depressed, the front with a distinct 

 longitudinal median incision, narrow but distinct; eyes reniform 

 in outline, subvertical; antennae considerably exceeding the body 

 in length. Pronotum scutellate, equal to half the length of the 

 body, moderately arched, the lateral portions deflected toward the 

 median line; cephalic portion considerably narrower than the caudal 

 portion, the margin truncate ; caudal margin very distinctly rotundate ; 

 lateral margins straight. Tegmina visible only as a projecting fringe 

 around the caudal portion of the pronotum, the structure apparently 

 being a fan-like set of radiating veins, margined apically l)y a narrow 

 deflected subcoriaceous area. Abdomen short, thickly covered with 

 scales. Limbs heavily scaled; cephalic and median pair very short; 

 caudal femora strongly inflated, supplied with a number of long hairs, 

 tibiae shorter than the femora and narrowed somewhat proximad, meta- 

 tarsi serrato-dentate dorsad. 



General colors vandyke brown and silvery- white, the tibiae and tarsi 

 alternately ringed with these shades; caudal femora silvery-white 

 obscvu'ely mottled with the darker color; antennae wood brown, be- 

 coming darker apically and narrowly and rather sparsely ringed with 

 a deeper shade : head probably uniform silvery-white when unrubbed ; 

 4 




50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



pronotum cinnamon darker on the lateral portions of the cephalic half, 

 the lateral lobe lined above with pale ochre-yellow and below with a 

 broad line of silvery-white scales. Tegmina bone white, the margins 

 blotched with the two predominating colors. Abdomen finely mottled 

 with the two contrasting tints. 



Measurements. 



Length of body, 5 mm. 



Length of pronotum, 2.9 " 



Caudal width of pronotum, . 1.9 " 



Length of caudal femora, 3.1 " 



Of this beautiful and peculiar species the type is the only specimen 

 which has been seen. The striking coloration is quite distinctive and 

 will immediately separate; it from L. krugii. 



This specimen I captured in the pine woods to the west of Miami, 

 It was first noticed perched on the top of a tuft of wire-grass. After 

 having swept it into the net -I very nearly lost it, for it jumped around 

 with great agility. (H.) 



Nemobius socius Seudder. 



An adult female and an immature individual from Tampa, taken 

 January 16 and 17, 1904, represent this species. The adult has the 

 tegmina but slightly longer than the head and pronotum, while the 

 wings are not visible. In all other respects, however, the Tampa 

 female is inseparable from macropterous individuals from Thomas ville, 

 Georgia. 



Nemobius ambitiosus Scudder. 



This beautiful species is represented by three specimens, two males 

 and a nymph, from Miami, taken February 6, 1904, and a pair from 

 Tampa, taken January 16 and 17, 1904. 



This species is almost invariably found in dead leaves. (H.) 



Nemobius aterrimus Scudder. 



This species, originally described from Jacksonville, Florida, is repre- 

 sented by a pair taken at Tampa on January 17, 1904. 

 Gryllus firmus Scudder. 



A single male from Miami represents this species. 

 Gryllus rubens Scudder. 



This species is represented by a series of ten males and sixteen 

 females. 



Miami specimens were taken on February 6, 1904, and August 19 

 and 21, 1903; Tampa specimens on January 16, 1904, and Chokoloskee 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



individuals in April and May, 1903. Several of the specimens are 

 smaller than the usual type and are referred here with a little uncer- 

 tainty. 



The specimens taken on February 6 were all found under boards and 

 •stones along the main street of Miami. They were captured after 

 dusk while stridulating at a great rate. (H.) 



Gryllodes poeyi (Saussure). 



This Antillean species is represented by m'ne specimens, three adult 

 males, two adult females and four nymphs, from Miami, taken Febru- 

 ary 6, 7, and 9, 1904. They are inseparable from a series of Cuban 

 and Bahaman individuals, and constitute the first record of the species 

 from the United States. 



The first evening in Miami I heard this cricket stridulating in cracks 

 between the bricks of the drive leading to the Hotel Royal Palm. 

 Marking the places, as it was then too dark to investigate, I left them 

 till the next morning. I then was able to raise the bricks and collected 

 several specimens. One specimen was taken stridulating in a crack 

 six feet from the ground between the stones which form the front of 

 the Miami Bank. This insect emits a shrill sound easily distinguished 

 from Gryllus ruhens by its higher pitch and the longer duration of the 

 stridulations. When exposed it waves its long slender antennae about 

 continually. (H.) 



Cyrtoxipha delicatula Scudder. 



A series of eight adult males, seven adult females and a nymph from 

 Key West, taken January 19, 1904, are referred to this species. An 

 adult male and a nymph were also taken at Miami, February 6, 1904. 

 This series does not wholly agree with Scudder's description, taken from 

 two males from Fort Reed and Sand Point, Florida, but as a great 

 amount of variation in the presence of pronotal hairs and considerable 

 in the length of the wings is exhibited by the specimens studied, it is 

 impossible to attempt to separate them. Saussure's C. gundlachi is 

 ■of a quite different appearance. 



Key West. — These specimens I beat from Ilex cassine with little 

 difficulty. I found no others on any other bushes, and would probably 

 have missed the species in this locality had I not happened to beat this 

 bush. I found it to be the same in the case of Plectoptera poeyi and 

 Liphoplus krugii. 



Miami. — The nymph was beaten from a bush in the "hammock," 

 and the mature specimen was taken at night when beating for Micro- 

 centrum. (H.) 




52 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Hapithus quadratus Scudder. 



This species, which has been synonymized with H. agitator by both 

 Saussurc and Scudder, appears to be quite distinct and really separable 

 from the northern H. agitator. The tcgmina of the female are some- 

 what longer and with a more complex venation, while the posterior 

 limbs are longer and distinctly colored, and as far as available material 

 o-oes the general size appears greater. Two adult females from Miami 

 were taken August 11 and 21, 1903, while two nymphs from the same 

 place were collected on February 6, 1904. One nymph was taken at 

 Key West, January 19, 1904. 



Keij West.— This specimen was taken, together with Plectoplcra 

 poeyi and Liphoplus krugii, while beating Ilex cassine. (H.) 



Orocharis saulcyi (c;ir6riu). 



This Antillcan species, here recorded from the United States for 

 the first time, is represented by two males taken at Miami, one on Feb- 

 ruary 3, the other on August 19, 1903. The very slender form and 

 structure of the tegmina will readily separate this from the other North 

 American species. 



The specimen captured on February 3, 1903, was beaten from the 

 high weeds in a waste field, (H.) 

 Tafalisca' lurida Walker. 



A single female from Chokoloskee represents this species. 



' This name was denied recognition by Saussure for lack of significance, but 

 it should replace Metrypa Brunner, having five years priority.

 depth Sf. Body strongly compressed, and of more fusiform profile. 

 Spines large, fifth longest. Second anal spine reaching past origin of 

 soft anal fin which is inserted a little behind that of soft dorsal. Ven- 

 tral equally as long as pectoral, and reaching a little beyond anus, 

 but not quite to origin of spinous anal. Pectoral broad. 



Scomberoides toloo-parah (Riippcll)^ from the Red Sea needs com-

 been greatly confused. Gray's moluccensis seems to be the oldest 

 name available for the East Indian form, with which I also identify 

 that from Polynesia.

This little-known form is well marked and easily distinguished from 

 0. sauriis by the longer maxillary and shape of the patch of vomerine 

 teeth. The form called palometa is said to have the posterior margin of 

 the infraorbital ring deeply concave. This is not true of my example, 

 as it has the posterior rim of the infraorbital nearly vertical.

 prcopercular spines. The largest example noted above agrees per- 

 fectly with the large ^lediterranean examples in the posterior position

 example from Panama (Coll. J. A. McNeil) has: Head 3; depth 3f ; D. 

 I, VIII-I, 26; A. II-I, 23; scales in lateral line 48, and remaining 

 keeled scutes 33 (81) ; pectoral 1| in head; snout 3f in head, measured 

 from tip of upper jaw; eye 3; maxillary 2^; length 9| inches. An- 

 other example from Samoa differs in: Head 3j; depth 3|; A. II-I, 

 22; 54 scales in lateral Hne, and remaining keeled scutes 35 (89); eye 

 Sh in head, measured from tip of upper jaw; snout 3^; maxillary 2f ; 

 length 7| inches. Smaller Hawaiian examples*" differ in minor details. 



I provisionally follow Dr. Giinther in identifying all these examples 

 with Bloch's crumenophthalmus, though possibly exhaustive material 

 may prove different.

THE MOVEMENTS OF GREGARINES. 



BY HOWARD CRAWLEY. 



For the proper comprehension of the movements displayed by gre- 

 garines, it is advisable first to consider the form and anatomy of the 

 animals. In a species like Porospora gigantea Van Beneden the ratio 

 of length to breadth is 50-1, whereas Lophocephalus insignis Aime 

 Schn. is nearly spherical. It is obvious that the first of these two 

 species can display movements of contortion which the second cannot. 

 These are extreme cases, but gregarines may roughly be divided into 

 long, slender and short, stout species, and in a discussion of their move- 

 ments it is well to keep in mind the limitations to flexibility imposed 

 on the latter merely on account of their shape. 



Further limitations are imposed by the anatomical structure. From 

 without inward, a polycystid gregarine displays epicyte, sarcocyte, 

 myocyte and entocyte. The epicyte is a cuticular layer, the function 

 of which is protective. It is always present, and varies considerably 

 in thickness in the different species. The sarcocyte is a layer of clear 

 protoplasm which, in a typical case, is continuous over the entire ani- 

 mal. This condition exists in such genera as Gregarina, Stenophora 

 and Amphoroides. Frequently, however, the sarcocyte is lacking, 

 except for the septum, which it constitutes, and in the immediately 

 adjacent parts. These two layers may collectively be termed the 

 ectosarc. 



The myocyte is described by some authors as a part of the ectosarc; 

 by others as a part of the endosarc (entocyte). It is made up of a 

 layer of fibrils. Of these, the more conspicuous encircle the animal 

 in a slightly spiral direction. The circular fibres are joined together by 

 longitudinal and diagonal connectives, the whole system forming a net. 



The entocyte of gregarines is probably much like that of other 

 protozoa. It is composed of soft, distinctly alveolar protoplasm, 

 liberally provided with the so-called granules of reserve. 



It will be seen from the above that the ectosarc of gregarines may 

 vary greatly in thickness. We may have a species in which both the 

 component layers are thick. On the other hand, the epicyte may be 

 thin and the sarcocyte absent. We probably have here an explanation 

 for the difference in the rigidity of gregarines. Some species, such as 




90 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Stenophora jidipusiUi Leidy, tend to maintain a certain definite shape. 

 Changes of this shape may be extensive, but are usually of short dura- 

 tion. Further, the contortions are of such a character that the true 

 form is by no means disguised, and the resumption of this true form is 

 always a very sudden process. We may conclude from this that the 

 ectosarc is stiff and elastic. Under the force of the contractile ele- 

 ments it may suffer contortion, but as soon as the force is released 

 the proper form is rcsvmied with a sudden jerk. The comparison may 

 be made with a hollow india-rubber ball, or, perhaps better, it may be 

 said that these grcgarines behave as if their ectosarc were composed 

 of india-rubber. They may further be compared with such ciliates 

 as ParamcEcium, at least in so far as regards the sudden resumption of 

 the normal contour after a deformation. 



On the other hand, gregarines like Trichorhynchus pulcher Aime 

 Schn. are highly polymorphic. Different individuals present c^uite 

 different outlines, and these outlines are subject to continual and 

 extensive changes. Their movements may not inaptly be termed 

 amoeboid. All polycystid gregarines possess what may be designated 

 as a typical outline, but it is often difficult, in these polymorphic 

 species, to determine what this typical outline may be. Their ecto- 

 sarc, while extremely flexible and extensible, does not appear to possess 

 any elasticity. In consequence, deformation may be carried to such 

 an extent as to render the typical form wholly unrecognizable, nor is 

 there ever seen that sudden resumption of the typical form so often 

 displayed by such species as Stenophora julipusilli. 



This difference appears to be due mainly to the sarcocyte. Usually, 

 in these polymorphic animals, the ectosarc consists of epicyte alone. 

 Further, the epicyte may be thin. The facts, then, are in accord with 

 what we should expect on mechanical principles. The elastic species 

 possess a sarcocyte; the polymorphic do not. It may therefore be 

 inferred that the elasticity is due to the sarcocyte, and confirmatory 

 evidence is furnished by the Monocystidea. These animals, which are 

 frequently highly polymorphic, appear generally to lack a sarcocyte. 

 The rule, however, is not absolute, since Stenophora iCnemidospora) 

 spiroholi Crawley, the protomerite of which is very flexible, possesses 

 a thick sarcocyte. 



Obviously, the ability of a gregarine to display changes of form 

 depends upon two factors.^ These are the flexibility of its ectosarc 

 and the power of the contractile elements. It has been shown that 



' There is possibly a third factor, as will be pointed out below. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



great differences exist in the first of these in different gregarincs. I 

 shall now consider the contractile element. 



This is evidently the myocyte. The evidence that the myocyte is 

 contractile is purely inferential, but none the less satisfactory. The 

 fibre is the form always taken by differentiated contractile substance. 

 Other protozoa, ciliates and flagellates, show like elements, and most 

 of the movements displayed by polycystid grcgarines are compre- 

 hensible only by assuming the myocyte to be a contractile system. 

 On the other hand, certain movements exhibited by the polymorphic 

 species cannot so readily be explained in this way, as I shall presently 

 show. 



Confining our attention for the moment to these movements for 

 which the myocyte seems an adequate cause, they are found to be dis- 

 played by all gregarines. They are, however, as we should expect, 

 far more definite in the elastic than in the polymorphic species. The 

 most usual are mere bendings of the longitudinal axis, the character 

 and extent of which appear to depend largely upon the shape of the 

 gregarine and the nature of its eclosarc. The least extensive are 

 bendings of the protomerite, which may take place in any plane. 

 These may be so slight as to be difficult to detect, or so extensive that 

 the axis of the protomerite comes to form a right angle with that of 

 the deutomerite. They readily lead to a distortion wherein the angle 

 in the longitudinal axis is formed in the deutomerite instead of at the 

 septum. This may be a right angle even in such relatively thick 

 species as Stenophora julipusilli Leidy. In Gregarina dicceli Crawley, 

 which is a vermiform gregarine with a thin epicyte and no sarcocyte, 

 this distortion becomes more evident. The protomerite and anterior 

 part of the deutomerite bend round to form a hook, the anterior surface 

 of the protomerite being directed backward. As the point in the longi- 

 tudinal axis where the original bending takes place moves further and 

 further backward, the hook becomes larger and larger until the gre- 

 garine forms a U. This U may pass into a circle and the circle into a 

 coil or a spiral. Gregarina polydesmivirginiensis Leidy^ displays con- 

 tortions of exactly the same character. Animals such as S. julipusilli 

 Leidy frequently bend double, but the circular or coiled condition can- 

 not well be assimied by any but the long slender gregarines. 



When only the protomerite is involved, the movement is frequently 

 first to one side and then to the other. This may also happen when the 

 anterior part of the deutomerite participates along with the proto- 



^ According to L^ger et Duboscq (1903), this species belongs to the genus 

 Stenophora, since it stands very close to the Stenophora nematoidesoi these authors.

merite. Occasionally, also, it is the posterior part of the deutomerite 

 which is bent, the balance of the animal maintaining its original posi- 

 tion. Yet however varied these bendings may be, they are all of them 

 only contortions whereby the longitudinal axis loses its original straight- 

 ness. 



Their cause is contractions of the myocyte. It is easy to see how 

 such contortions could be produced by a shortening of the longitudinal 

 fibres of one side, possibly aided by a contraction of the transverse 

 fibres at the place where the bendings originate. This pull on the part 

 of the myocyte is resisted by the ectosarc to a greater or less extent, 

 contingent upon its rigidity and elasticity. This is shown by the sud- 

 denness with which the ectosarc springs back to its original position, 

 which presumably takes place when the pull exerted by the myocyte 

 ceases to act. The behavior of the ectosarc in such a case is, as previ- 

 ously stated, precisely what it would be were it composed of india- 

 rubber. 



The following point is also worthy of note. When a gregarine begins 

 to curve, one side is lengthened and the other shortened. The ecto- 

 sarc is evidently capable of a certain amount of contraction, since a 

 crescentic form may be assumed with the shortened side still presenting 

 a smooth contour. But if the bending be carried to any considerable 

 extent, the inner surface folds, the number and depth of these folds 

 depending upon the shape of the gregarine and the extent of the curva- 

 ture. This shows that the power of the ectosarc to contract is limited. 



A movement of the same general character as the bending is one 

 whereby the longitudinal axis is shortened. It consists in the pulling 

 of the protomerite into the deutomerite, as one may withdraw the 

 hand into the sleeve. I have noticed this in a number of species, 

 although it is by no means so frequently seen as the bending. It is 

 displayed indifferently by animals which are progressing and those 

 which are not. As in the case of the bending, the return to the typical 

 shape, in the elastic species, is by a sudden jerk. This movement is 

 explainable by a shortening of the longitudinal fibres around a given 

 zone of the animal's body. 



There is finally the so-called peristalsis. This, as defined by Delage 

 et Herouard (1896), consists of "Contractions peristaltiques, produites 

 par un etranglement transversal qui se propage le long du corps." It 

 does not, however, admit of quite so simple a definition. It may be a 

 swelling instead of a constriction. Further, it frequently happens that 

 instead of a series of such constrictions or swellings there will be but 

 one, which passes from the region of the septum to the posterior end 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 93 



of the animal. In the typical associations, as in Gregarina, this move- 

 ment is described as passing from the anterior end of the primite to 

 the posterior end of the satellite without the slightest pause. We have 

 here a demonstration that it is not due to endoplasmic movements. 



In general, the conspicuousness of the peristaltic movement depends 

 on the character of the cctosarc. In the stiff, clastic forms this move- 

 ment is by no means common, and when it does occur it generally 

 consists of a single contraction. On the other hand, it is well displayed 

 by the polymorphic species with thin ectosarcs. In one species, 

 Actinocephalus harpali Crawley, I have frequently observed a disposi- 

 tion to rumple the edges of the body, so that they present a scries of 

 scallops. These scallops were seen to undergo slow changes in size 

 and sometimes they moved slowly backward. I take this to be a 

 peristaltic movement, although much slower than is usual. 



The cause throughout is probably contractions of the circular fibres. 

 Further, following the division which I have made, the peristaltic 

 movement comes under the head of shortenings of the longitudinal 

 axis. 



The above are all the movements involving change of shape which 

 can with absolute certainty be credited to contractions of the myocyte. 

 They result in varied and frequently considerable alterations of the 

 contour of the animal, but they can all be placed in two categories : 



(1) Bendings and curvings of the longitudinal axis. 



(2) Shortenings of the longitudinal axis. 



The two may, and doubtless frequently do, take place at once, but 

 apparently the first is by far the more frequent expression of the con- 

 tractility of the myocyte. 



There now remain for consideration a series of phenomena displayed 

 by the polymorphic forms wherein the Polycystidea approximate the 

 conditions normal to the Monocystidea. Of the several species which 

 I have observed, they are best illustrated by Trichorhynchus pulcher 

 Aime Schn. This animal changes shape as readily as Euglena or even 

 Amceha. The anterior margin of the protomerite may present a 

 straight edge, a curve or a long tongue-shaped protrusion. The pos- 

 terior end of the deutomerite may be bluntly rounded, sharply pointed 

 or even bifurcated. The animal may also be so contorted as to lose 

 all semblance to a polycystid gregarine and to present the kind of out- 

 line we associate with Amoeba. These changes take place constantly, 

 and by no means slowly, but always gradually. Stenophora spiroboli 

 Crawley, another polymorphic species, has to be watched very patiently 

 before the true form can be made out. It constantly displays contor-

tions which are most conspicuous at the anterior end, and these con- 

 tortions are of such a character that it is wholly impossible to say 

 whether a given point of the surface is protomerite or deutomerite. 

 From this end, moreover, little lobopodia were seen to arise and dis- 

 appear. 



In the case of a small gregarine from Lithohius, a very noteworthy 

 movement was seen. This expressed itself as a slight peristalsis, the 

 wave being evident at times on only one side. It was accompanied 

 by a flow, en masse, of the granules of the entocyte. This flow, start- 

 ing at the posterior part of the deutomerite, would pass forward until 

 it struck the septum. Here the granular mass was deflected backward, 

 the peristalsis being reversed at the same instant. In one case the 

 nucleus was carried forward and backward along with the granules. 

 This movement was seen both in animals that were progressing and 

 those which were not. It was displayed constantly, but was generally 

 very much faster when the animal was progressing. In one observa- 

 tion made, however, the gregarine showing this movement had its 

 progression suddenly checked by striking an obstruction, and here 

 the flow and peristalsis continued with unabated vigor. Frequently 

 when gregarines are pinched by passing through narrow places, or 

 when they bend, the entocyte is seen to flow. But in no other case 

 amongst the Folycystidea which has ever come under my notice was 

 the flowing anything like so free and extensive. These gregarines were 

 very favorable for a study of the movements of the entocyte, since the 

 number of granules was remarkably few and their flowing easy to 

 observe. 



A somewhat similar peristaltic movement was once seen in Tricho- 

 rhynchus pulcher Aime Schn. Here, the gregarine lying in one place, 

 the wave arose at the posterior end and passed forward. The move- 

 ments on both sides were not synchronous. It differed from the case 

 just described in that there was no reversal, the movement being con- 

 tinuously forward . 



The protrusion of the long tongue-shaped process by T. pulcher and 

 of the lobopodia by *S. spiroboli are not satisfactorily credited to activ- 

 ity of the myocyte. Such an action would appear to involve the spon- 

 taneous lengthening of relaxed fibres, which is scarcely possible. But 

 even if it did not, the form of the mj^ocyte, which is that of a fine-meshed 

 net, would not seem to lend itself to such movements. They would 

 necessitate an enormous elongation of a very small part of the system, 

 and would thus predicate a complexity of action which we could hardly 

 expect in so simple an apparatus. Without, however, desiring to preju- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 95 



dice the decision, it is advisable to see if an explanation may not be 

 had along different lines. 



The formation of pseudopodia in rhizopods is due to movements 

 of the endosarc, and in gregarines the endosarc is evidently mobile. It 

 may therefore be suggested that the polymorphism of certain of the 

 Polycystidea is caused in the same way as it is in Rhizopoda. An 

 endoplasmic flow, if by chance it were directed radially, would evidently 

 result in such protrusions as are actually seen in Trichorhynchus. For 

 it is to be remembered that such forms have a thin, extensible ectosarc, 

 which would offer little resistance to such a flow. The difficulty in 

 arriving at a decision is that the endosarc of most polycystids is so 

 opaque that flowing movements might take place without it being 

 possible to detect them. As I have already stated, the little gregarine 

 of Lithobius is the only species at all favorable for a study of this 

 element which has yet come under my notice. 



In the Monocystidea, however, the conditions are more favorable. 

 Flowing of the endosarc is a matter of common observation, and it has 

 generally been taken to be the cause of their polymorphism. While 

 this may be so, my own observations on monocystids lead me to ques- 

 tion it. These were made on a species of Diplocystis, a parasite of 

 Allolobophora longa. This gregarine has the form of a serpent. In 

 the cases observed movements were constant. There would appear 

 at any point of the body a swelling which passed rapidly either forward 

 or backward. The endoplasm fills this swollen part, flowing into it 

 in front and out of it behind. Two such swellings may arise simul- 

 taneously and, advancing toward each other, amalgamate. The large 

 swelling thus produced would maintain a fixed size for a moment, and 

 then from its central part two streams would start in opposite direc- 

 tions, and the swelling would rapidly disappear. In one case the 

 peripheral granules in a swelling moved along with it, while those in 

 the centre moved in the opposite direction. 



An individual of this species was observed to burst,' permitting the 

 escape of a portion of the granular contents. The ectosarc thereupon 

 contracted, and showed very plainly a series of strise, parallel and 

 spirally disposed. Evidently these stria were the expression of a 

 powerful myocyte. 



Contractions of the myocyte would produce a flowing of the endo- 

 plasm; flowing of the endoplasm would result in extensions of the 

 limiting layer. Hence, on purely a priori grounds, the one explanation 

 has as much claim to consideration as the other. In the case of the 

 phenomena just described, however, it seems far more reasonable to 




96 rilOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



credit them to muscular action. They were movements evidently to 

 be compared with the peristalsis of the Polycystidea, which, as I have 

 pointed out, cannot be credited to endoplasmic currents. Moreover, 

 they were so rapid and so evidently powerfvil that a comparison with 

 what we see in Amoeha fails. Further, if they were caused by endo- 

 plasmic movements, the myocyte is left without a function, which is a 

 most improbable supposition. 



It therefore seems more probable that the polymorphism of the 

 Monocystidea is due to muscular action. Hence, by analogy, the poly- 

 morphism of the Polycystidea should be accounted for in the same 

 way. Nevertheless, as I have indicated, this view has certain objec- 

 tions and the decision is better postponed until additional data arc 

 obtained. 



In an article on the progression of gregarines (Crawley, 1902). I 

 endeavored to show that when the protomerite of a gregarine is bont 

 to one side or the other, the siu-face of the deutomerite shows a wave 

 which passes backward and transversely at the same time. My obser- 

 vations also indicated that the extent of the bending of the protomerite 

 conditioned the extent of this wave. Further, when the bending of the 

 protomerite was first to one side and then to the other, that is, when it 

 oscillated, the transverse component of the wave on the sm-face of the 

 deutomerite was also first to one side and then to the other. I there- 

 fore regard these two manifestations of activity as due to the same 

 contraction of the myocyte. That is, a contraction wnich causes the 

 protomerite to bend causes also this wave to pass over the surface of 

 the deutomerite. 



Certain criticisms which have been made upon this paper lead me to 

 suppose that I did not bring out this point as clearly as desirable. I 

 shall therefore make use of a comparison. If we bare the forearm and 

 then slowly close the fingers tightly, a muscular wave passes upward 

 and outward along the dorsal surface of the arm. By alternately con- 

 tracting and relaxing the fingers, this wave exhibits an alternate trans- 

 verse movement. In this case, the conspicuous result of muscular 

 contraction is the closing or opening of the hand, but it is necessarily 

 correlated with the disturbance on the surface of the forearm. In the 

 gregarine, the oscillation of the protomerite is the conspicuous mani- 

 festation of muscular activity, and, under ordinary conditions of obser- 

 vation, the only one which is seen. But it is always accompanied by 

 the wave on the surface of the deutomerite. The result is that a given 

 point on the gregarine's surface pushes backward and transversely 

 upon whatever may be in contact with it. This brings about a move- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



merit of the entire animal in an opiDOsitc direction. The movement 

 will be rectilinear or zigzag, dependent on the less or greater extent 

 of the transverse movement. This last, in its turn, depends on the 

 extent of the oscillation of the protomcrite. Hence, when the grega- 

 rine is advancing in a straight line, the evidence for muscular action 

 is very slight. 



My observations also indicated that gregarines arc sticky, and that 

 they do not seem able to progress unless in contact with a surface. 

 I was therefore led to postulate the stickiness as more or less of a neces- 

 sity in progression, its role being to prevent slipping of the particular 

 part in contact with either the slide or cover-glass. Later observatioixs, 

 however, have led me to modify this opinion. Contact appears neces- 

 sary, but not necessarily contact with a continuous surface. The 

 observations were as follows: 



The host intestine was teazed on a cover-glass, under a limited 

 quantity of salt solution. The cover-glass was then inverted, and 

 supported on a ring. In this way a mount having considerable depth 

 was obtained. The results were to show that gregarines are able to 

 progress away from a surface provided they can get into contact with 

 some solid matter. One, originally moving on the surface film on the 

 bottom of the drop, pushed its way upward through the particles of 

 host intestine. In such cases, however, progression is slow and ap- 

 parently difficult, and accompanied by constant and violent contortions. 

 It may, moreover, be stated that in proportion as the environment 

 renders progression more difficult, the evidences for muscular activity 

 become more obvious. Thus, when an advancing gregarine encounters 

 a mass of loose host tissue, it frequently endeavors to bore or wriggle its 

 way through, and muscular contractions at once become very exten- 

 sive. 



The abihty of gregarines to make their way amidst particles of solid 

 in a hanging drop suggests that, in some cases at least, progression is 

 effected in somewhat the same way as that of a snail. The presence 

 of an adhesive substance on the surface may assist, but the primary 

 factor is the alterations of the contour of the surface. These are doubt- 

 less by no means so regular as those of the foot of a snail, nor is gre- 

 garine progression usually so smooth. Yet, without going into tedious 

 details, it is easy enough to see how such movements could produce 

 progression. When, however, progression is being effected on a smooth 

 surface, the adhesive substance probably plays a part. 



A curious phenomenon was once exhibited by a little gregarine of 

 Scolopocryptops sexspinosus. This is a very active species, progressing 

 7 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



continually in straight lines and curves of long radius. It would occa- 

 sionally give a sudden jerk, and advance by perhaps its own length by 

 a leap. This ability to leap was never seen in any other species. 



There finally remains for consideration what is probably a form of 

 the progressive movement. Prior to cucystment gregarincs pair, the 

 association in a genus like Gregarina being apparently only precocious 

 pairing. It may be "head to tail" as in Gregarina, or "head to head" 

 as in Pterocephalus. In either case the pair bends double at its middle 

 point, thus 1:)ringing the gregarines side by side. Before or during this 

 last, process the system begins to rotate. During the course of this 

 rotation the two individuals become more and more closely apposed 

 until a spherical form is assumed. Meanwhile a common covering 

 is secreted, the cyst formed and eventually the rotatory movement 

 ceases. 



This movement is generally mentioned by those authors who have 

 made observations on the encystment of gregarines, but no attempt ap- 

 pears to have been made to account for it. Biitschli (1881), however, 

 states that muscular contractions are to be observed at the time when 

 the two animals begin to fuse. The explanation advanced by Schewia- 

 koff, that gregarines progress by means of the extension of a stalk of 

 gelatinous fibres, is here manifestly inapplicable. Further, since 

 according to the accounts the rotation continues until after a certain 

 amount of a gelatinous investment is secreted, changes of surface con- 

 tour would not seem to be of effect. One point, however, is worthy 

 of attention. The rotation, both in nature and when the gregarines 

 arc on the slide, doubtless takes place when the animals are suspended 

 in a liquid. The only opposition which the rotation encounters is 

 then the friction of this liquid, and this would be almost infinitesimal. 

 That is, it does not seem necessary to assume that the impulse lasts 

 as long as the rotation itself. The latter, once started, would continue 

 of its own momentum for probably a considerable period of time. 



Accurate observations are, nevertheless, a desideratum, and, as I 

 have stated, these are yet to be made. I have, however, at times 

 observed a rotation on the part of solitary gregarines. One case was 

 particularly striking. The gregarines, specimens of Trichorhynchus 

 pulcher Aime Schn., holding the body bent, moved around the circum- 

 ference of a circle. The curved longitudinal axis of the animals formed 

 an arc of this circumference, the radius of which was perhaps one-half 

 the animal's length. That part of the circumference not occupied by 

 the gregarine was filled with a mass of sundry small particles, the 

 movements of which followed that of the gregarine. That is, there 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 99 



was evidently present a ring-shaped mass of invisible jelly which was 

 continuous from the anterior to the posterior end of the gregarine. 

 In this case, although the conditions for observation were favorable, no 

 cause for the motion could be detected. I have also seen individuals 

 of Stenophora julipusilli exhibit this rotation. 



These phenomena, while not in any way explaining the cause of the 

 rotatory motion, show that it is not necessarily correlated with encyst- 

 ment. It is merely one of the several phases of the mobility of gre- 

 garines, ordinarily most conspicuously in evidence at the time of 

 encystmcnt. It has been the custom to separate these several phases 

 and to treat them as w^hoUy distinct phenomena. This custom I 

 believe to be unfortunate. It appears to me that all the motor phe- 

 nomena which the Polycystidea display may be directly credited to 

 contractions of the myocyte, with the possible exception of the amoe- 

 boid movements of certain species, and the rotation. For these 

 observational evidence is required before pronouncing a final decision.

 is otherwise smooth. The aperture is narrow, sinuous, more than 

 half the length of the shell, the outer lip decidedly thickened within 

 in the middle, armed with about five tubercular or elongated teeth; 

 apex entire or nearly so. Whorls 7 to 7^. Length 11.5, diam. 5.5 

 mm.

This form has a superficial resemblance to C. cribraria, but the shape 

 of the aperture shows it to be related to C. pardalina japonica Rve. 

 ( + C. sagena Rve.). C. p. suhcrihraria is only about half the size of 

 its larger cousin, its aperture is slightly less contracted and the spots 

 are smaller, but otherwise the two forms do not differ materially. 

 Buooinum unicum n. sp. 



Shell solid but rather thin, ovate-conic, fleshy-whitish under a very 

 thin, smooth, dehiscent light olive cuticle. The last whorl has a strong 

 keel at the shoulder, above which the surface slopes up to the suture, 

 with a second obtuse keel a little nearer to the suture than to the first 

 keel. Below the shoulder keel the surface is at first slightly concave, 

 then evenly convex and rather swollen, contracting as usual below. 

 The whorls of the spu-e are terrace-like, and the last 4 at least are cari- 

 nated like the last whorl, those above being deeply eroded. Wliorls 

 6. The base is sculptured with strong spiral cords, gradually dimin- 

 ishing toward the periphery. Over the whole there is a minute sculp- 

 ture of fine spiral strise, beautifully crenulated by minute growth-strise. 

 The aperture is white within, outer lip simple and unexpanded. The 

 columellar margin is concave in the middle, straight below. The 

 anterior notch is moderately wide and deep. The inner lip is covered 

 with a white enamel, preceded by an eroded groove. 

 Length 58.5, diam. 32, length of aperture 31 mm. 

 Kisennuma, Rikuzen. Type No. 88,820, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,761 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This peculiar whelk has much resemblance in general figure to 

 Buccinum taphrium Dall, type of the section Sulcosinus. It is more 

 elongated than that, and differs further in the less spreading columellar 

 callous, the much less sinuous columella, the additional keel above the 

 shoulder, and in not having a channelled suture, though the upper keel, 

 in a more depressed shell, would define a channel. It seems to connect 

 Sulcosinus with the more normal forms of Buccinum.

 Siphonalia vanattai n. sp. PI. Ill, fig. 13. 



The shell is obcsely-fiisiform, the greatest width about median, solid 

 and strong; white, irregularly marked with dull purplish-brown spots 

 of irregular shape, and with narrow reddish-brown spiral lines, most 

 distinct behind the lip, six and equidistant or fewer by the omission of 

 some of them. Wliorls 6 (the protoconch being lost in the specimens 

 seen), longitudinally costate, 13 to 15 rounded ribs on the last whorl, 

 where they are most prominent at the shoulder, rapidly diminishing 

 below it, and not extending upon the base; sculptured throughout 

 with spiral rounded cords with threads occasionally interposed. The 

 last two whorls are subangular at the shoulder, the preceding whorls 

 being very convex. Last whorl is strongly contracted below. The 

 aperture is oblique, its length (including the anterior canal) about 

 two-thirds that of the shell, pale, dull, reddish-brown inside becoming 

 ochre-fleshy between the lirse, pure white on the bevelled edge. It is 

 rather sharply sulcate within. The outer lip is symmetrically arched. 

 Anterior canal deep and moderately recurved.

Yakushima, Osumi. Types No. 87,746, A. N. S. P., from No. 1,602

This small species resembles S. hinnulus in general contour and 

 coloration; but it is much smaller, decidedly plicate, and Urate within 

 the aperture. It does not seem to agree with any of the numerous 

 unfigured and insufficiently described forms introduced by A. Adams. 

 S. spadicea is more slender than S. vanattai. 



Twenty-seven species of Siphonalia are now recorded from Japan. 

 Of these, *S>. hyperodon Pils. is a synonym of S. mikado Melvill.^ S. 

 stearnsii Pils. is closely related to S. pseudobuccinum Melv., but seems 

 to differ by its shorter anterior canal. S. semiplicata Pils. is a syno- 

 nym of S. fusoides Rve., while S. longirostris Dkr. seems to be merely 

 a variety of the same species. Eleven species have been described 

 without figures by A. Adams. Omitting these, there remain about 

 fourteen recognizable Japanese Siphonalise.

Shell ovate-oblong, thick and solid. On the last whorl there is a 

 subsutural welt followed by a depression, then seven slightly convex 

 girdles separated by narrower spaces, each occupied by a single low 

 cord at and above the periphery, but on the base the spaces are wider, 

 with two or three cortls ; on the spire a microscopic, dense subvertical 

 striation may be seen in unworn specimens. The girdles arc very low, 

 almost flat on the latter part of the last whorl, but more and more 

 raised earlier, two strong ones appearing on the penultimate whorl, 

 where they are somewhat nodose. On the earlier whorls these two 

 girdles and the subsutural welt are set with transversely oblong tuber- 

 cles along weak vertical folds. Siphonal fasciole short and convex. 

 Whorls about 6 J, the tip minutely eroded, the first whorl smooth. 

 Last whorl tapering and a little concave below the slightly swollen 

 peripheral region. Aperture oblique, about three-fifths the total length 

 of the shell, blackish within, with a single peripheral pale line. Ante- 

 rior channel short and deep, posterior sinus narrow and gutter-like, 

 defined by a curved ascending callous cord on the lip and a small 

 callous pad on the body. Outer lip regularly arcuate, thickened 

 within and armed with six teeth in adult shells. Columellar margin 

 dilated, rather wide. Color blackish-brown, with blue spots on some 

 of the spiral girdles, the tubercles on the spire and a few bands in inter- 

 vals on the last whorl being yellowish. Behind the lip all of the inter- 

 vals between the raised girdles become yellowish, terminating in sub- 

 triangular yellow spots on the bevelled lip, seven in number.

This peculiar little whelk has been unfortunate in its biographers. 

 Dr. Gould placed it in a wrong genus and family, and used a preoccu- 

 pied specific name; and Mr. Smith, who renamed it, had not seen a 

 specimen, and left it in the genus Planaxis. Pease, in a note on Usilla 

 fusconigra, alludes to Gould's species as a member of Usilla.^ The 

 species has not been figured hitherto. 



The group Usilla has been considered a subgenus of Vexilla, and 

 located in the Purpnrince. The rather flat columella, and yellowish

bands of the shell, and the microscopic vertical lineolation discernible 

 in places on U. gouldii are in favor of this classification, while the form 

 of the shell and the other characters of the aperture remind one more 

 of Pisania or Tritonidea in the Buccinidce. Until the dentition can 

 be examined, the position of Usilla must be left in doubt. 



U. gouldii is a larger and rougher species than U. f usee nigra, with 

 the spire much more strongly sculptured. No other species are known 

 to belong to the group.

 Brown-tinged white, with two chocolate-brown bands, which are more 

 or less interrupted into spots or oblique streaks, one in the middle of the 

 upper surface and ascending upon the penultimate whorl, the other 

 immediately below the periphery. The surface is rather dull, marked 

 with growth-lines, and showing faint, fine, subobsolete spiral striae. 

 Whorls 4^, convex, the spire very small. The aperture is oblique, 

 half-round and chestnut colored inside, with a pale entering basal band 

 and wide white lip-margin. The umbilical pad is small, semicircular, 

 bounded by a furrow, and separated from the parietal callous by a rather 

 large notch.

This species differs from N. clausa by the color-belts of the shell, 

 the notch between the umbilical pad and the parietal callous, and the 

 faint line parallel with the outer margin of the operculum. It differs 

 from A^. janthostoma Desh. and N. adamsiana Dkr. by the closure of 

 the imibilicus, and in wanting strong grooves on the operculum. 



Torinia densegranosa n. sp. PI. Ill, figs. 15, 16, 17. 



The shell is rather openly umbilicate, depressed-conic, dull light 

 reddish-brown, with some indistinct darker and yellowish spots along 

 the periphery. The spire is low-conic, apex obtuse; whorls 5+, but 

 slightly convex, the last rounded peripherally. The sculpture con- 

 sists of unequal flattened spiral cords and threads, cut by very fine, 

 close and regidar radial grooves. The cords are rather wide and flat 

 except near the periphery, where two or three of them are convex and 

 slightly prominent. Four spiral cords are visible on the upper surface, 

 with a thread between the third and fourth. On the periphery there 

 are two with a thread between them. On the base there are five ; the 

 outer one smaller, with a thread on each side of it, the umbilical cord 

 coarsely crenate, the next outer one with only about half as many 

 radial incisions as the following cords. There is a fine, not very dis- 

 tinct, spiral striation over the coarser sculpture described. The aper- 

 ture is notched at the termination of the umbilical cord. The opercu- 

 lum is a conic stack of thin yellow lamell2e.

EULIMID^. 



In my Catalogue of the Marine Mollushs of Japan, p. 77, some 23 

 species of Eulima are recorded, exclusive of Leiostraca, etc. Of this 

 number "E. cumingi Sowb." may have been an erroneous identifica- 

 tion, but as the specimen upon which it was based is not now accessible 

 to me, I am unable to revise it. The original E. cumingi A. Ad.* was 

 described from ''Lord Hood's Island, South Pacific," but, as in num- 

 erous other cases, the island intended by the label may have been one 

 of the Galapagos group, for the species does not seem to differ materi- 

 ally from Eulima splendidula Sowb.,* described from St. Elena, west 

 coast of Colombia. 



The name Eulima stenostoma A. Ad. is preoccupied for a species 

 described by Jeffreys, and may therefore be ignored. There remain 

 18 species "described" by Ai'thur Adams in his absurdly inadequate 

 manner, without dimensions or mention of the varices. While nobody 

 would presume to identify specimens by these diagnoses, it is frequently 

 possible to ascertain that no one of them corresponds wholly with a 

 particular specimen in hand. To facilitate such use of the descriptions, 

 I have recast the whole of them in the accompanying table. The 

 most prominent characters of any specimen may now be compared 

 with the entire series by glancing down the appropriate colimm, with- 

 out the waste of time and diversion of attention ensuing from reading 

 over the whole descriptions.

It will of course be understood, in studying descriptions of Eulimidce, 

 that the terms "spire inclined posteriorly," "apex recurved," etc., are 

 not in themselves significant, except in species with the varices all on 

 one side. In forms with alternately right and left varices, the spire 

 will be inclined first toward one, then toward the other side, or the apex 

 either forward or backward ; and in species with irregular varices, the 

 curvature may be in any direction. Moreover, the count of whorls is 

 not especially significant except in combination witn the length of the 

 shell. As in any shell having varices, there is no certain criterion 

 of adult growth except where a number of specimens are in hand. 



Eulima bovioornu n. sp. PL ll, figs. 9, lo. 



Shell moderately solid but not thick, white and glossy, the spire 

 regularly tapering, attenuate near the apex, strongly hent to the right 

 and backward. Whorls about 13, slightly convex, the sutures but 

 lightly impressed. Varices distinctly impressed, one on each whorl, all 

 on the right side, where they form a slowly receding ascending line, each 

 succeeding one being very slightly in advance of the preceding. The 

 aperture is ovate, the outer lip obtuse, arching well forward in the 

 middle, receding above. Columella short, concave, slightly calloused 

 but without a reflexed edge.

This species is apparently a near relative of E. tortuosa Adams and 

 Reeve^ from the China Sea, but that species is, from the figure, a little 

 more slender, more attenuated near the apex, and it has a longer, verti- 

 cal and straightened columella. With a length of about 12 mm., E.

Eulima luohuana Pils. PI. II. figs. 7, 8. 

 Proc. A. N. S. P., 1901, p. 396. 



Shell rather thin, white and glossy, regularly tapering, almost 

 straight, though there is a quite perceptible curvature near the apex. 

 Whorls 10 or 11, slightly convex, the suture but slightly marked. 

 Varices slightly impressed, not very distinct, mostly separated by the 

 space of somewhat more than a whorl, and therefore quite irregularly 

 placed. The aperture is acuminate-ovate, the outer lip obtuse, arched 

 forward in the middle, retracted above and below; the columella 

 slightly concave, slightly calloused, the edge not reflexed. 



Length 11, diam. 3.7 mm. 



The specimens originally described from Loochoo (Okinawa) Island 

 had lost the apices. The description above is from perfect shells from 

 Kkaiga-shima. The varices are all on the face and right side in the 

 two type specimens, as stated in the original description, but this is 

 merely accidental; in the larger series now received there are sometimes 

 a few on the left side, though most of them are on the face, right side 

 or back, usually scattered through an arc of a third of the circle, but 

 sometimes several are in a line on successive whorls. 



This species corresponds fairly well with A. Adams' description of 

 E. valida, but that shell is said to be straight, and no dimensions are 

 given. The curvature of E. luchuana, while slight, is readily appreci- 

 able.

 scratches are visible under a lens. The varices are situated at intervals 

 of three-fourths of a whorl, each marked by a white stripe followed by

So far as I know, this species has been recorded hitherto only from 

 Australia. I have not been able to compare Australian specimens, 

 and various important details, such as the number of whorls, are not 

 mentioned in the published descriptions. No critical comparison with 

 them of the specimens from the Bonin Islands can therefore be made 

 at this time.

 flattened. Whorls 4, convex, the last very wide. Aperture oblique,, 

 rounded-ovate, pearly with brilliant green reflections within, the lip 

 with a wide, dull, whitish margin. Columella arcuate, rather thin; 

 parietal callous thin. Umbilicus bounded by an angle. Operculum,

 Ethalia guamensis Quoy. 



This species was described from a single specimen procured at Guam 

 by the naturalists of the Astrolabe.'' The figure represents the shell 

 as having the umbilicus partly closed by a callous, but neither figure 

 nor description show whether this partial closure is effected by (1) a 

 callous pillar partly filling the umbilicus, or (2) by a mere reflection 

 of the columellar margin, vaulting over a free umbilical cavity. A. 

 Adams and subsequent authors have taken the first alternative and

identified guamensis with a shell of which Trochus callosus Koch and 

 Rotella montrouzieri Souv. are varietal forms. No form of this type 

 which I have encountered agrees fully with Quoy's figures and de- 

 scription; and it is not impossible that the real guamensis yet remains 

 unidentified, in which case Ethalia vwntrouzieri will become the senior 

 name for the guamensis of most authors.

This form differs from E. g. selenomphala by having the umbilicus 

 wholly filled, both in half -grown and adult shells, by the roseate 

 callous pad, as in Helicina or Umbonium. The general shape is not 

 unlike, except that the spire is more regularly low-conic in E. g. san- 

 guinea. Moreover, the upper surface is more coarsely maculate, and 

 the base is white except near the central pad. 



Probably ''Trochus callosus Koch" of Fischer {Iconogr. Coq. Viv., 

 PI. 115, fig. 3) should stand as another subspecies of E. guamensis. 

 Rotella montrouzieri Souv. will be still another subspecies.

 the upper surface sparsely marbled with purplish and pink, suffused 

 with pink on the spire, and encircled with numerous fine lines articu- 

 lated white and pink or brown. Base white, with a few pink spots. 

 The upper surface is convex, the inner w'horls only projecting in an 

 acute little cone. Whorls 6^, convex, parted by a well-impressed 

 suture, the last whorl very wide, narrowly rounded, almost subangular 

 peripherally. The base is convex. The aperture is very oblique,

ovate, the lip thin and simple. The umbilicus is nearly filled by a cal- 

 lous mass ending in a flattened, pink lobe, reducing the umbilicus to a 

 narrow semicircular cavity, which is bounded by a rounded, overhang- 

 ing cord ending in a flattened callous at the lip.

Distinguished by its narrowly crescentic umbilical cavity, in which 

 a very large spiral pillar stands, terminating in the callous pad, and 

 nearly filling the umbilicus. In sanguinea the callous is red and com- 

 pletely fills the umbilicus in both half-grown and adult shells — or at 

 least this is the case with the type lot. 



The whole shell is more depressed than the specimens of E. g. mon- 

 trouzieri before me, in which, moreover, the callous is white. 



Fischer's figure of E. callosa {Trochns callosus) differs by its semi- 

 circular callous nearly surrounding a subcircular umbilicus.

This group is to comprise species related to Monilea, Ethalia and 

 Isanda, but with features of the columellar lip and umbilicus unlike 

 either. Minolta and its boreal ally Solariella differ by the almost or 

 quite unexpanded columellar margin. 



The group will include, besides the type, Ethalia rhodomphala Smith, 

 Isanda pulchella A. Ad., and Trochus rhodomphalus Souv.

Shell much depressed, biconvex, obtusely carinate peripherally, 

 openly umbilicate. Flesh-tinted, with a band below the suture com- 

 posed of fine obliquely radial dark red lines alternating with white 

 ones. This is followed in the middle of the upper surface by a spiral 

 series of oblique, oblong red blotches alternating with opaque white 

 ones. Below these there is a minutely white-speckled belt, and then 

 at the periphery a series of red spots. On the base, the umbilicus is 

 fleshy-whitish ; outside of this there is a red area closely mottled with

opaque white; and between this tract and the periphery there is a 

 pale zone, sometimes marked with distant radial series of two red dots 

 each. The surface is smooth except at and above the periphery, 

 where there are several spiral striip. Wliorls 5J, slightly convex, 

 parted by an impressed suture. Umbilicus circular and deep, expand- 

 ing fuimel-like at the opening, where the sloping sides are excavated 

 in the middle and fineh^ sulcate radially. Aperture oblique, subcir- 

 cvilar, the peristome obtuse, the columellar margin broadly dilated, 

 covering a small part of the umbihcus.

This species is evidently related to Ethalia rhodomphala E. A. Smith,' 

 and Isanda pulchella A. Ad.^ From the latter it differs by the much 

 wider last whorl as viewed from above, and by the less extensively 

 covered umbilicus and white callous. It differs from E. rhodomphala 

 Smith chiefly by the color of the columellar callous. This is not a 

 feature of much importance, and I w^ould rank the Yakushima form 

 under rhodomphala as a variety were it not that the name of that spe- 

 cies is preoccupied for a new Caledonian form apparently referable to 

 the same genus, E. rhodomphala Souv."

Shell curved posteriorly, the larger half nearly straight, slender, the 

 diameter contained about 11 times in the length, moderately solid, 

 lusterless; white, with more or less blackish incrustation. Sculpture 

 of 12 acute, even ribs at the small end, parted by wider concave 

 intervals; these ribs gradually become lower and wider, but usually 

 retain their predominance over subsequently acquired sculpture to 

 the end, though becoming low and obtuse. Secondary threads soon 

 appear in the intervals, and on the last third of the shell tertiary 

 threads, with some additional minor threads in some intervals, or rid- 

 ing on the slopes of the larger threads. In full-grown individuals all 

 longitudinal sculpture becomes subobsolete close to the aperture. 

 Growth-lines fine and obliquely circular throughout. The aperture is 

 circular with rather thin peristome. Apical orifice ovate, the inner

Heda, Izu, with D. coruscuyn. Type No. 88,319, A. N. S. P. 



This is probably nearer D. weinkauffi than to any other Japanese 

 species now known. It apparently belongs to the group comprising 

 D. entails, occidentale, etc., and referred to the subgenus Antalis, but 

 it is also about equally as much related to D. agassizi, a form from the 

 Panamic region in 322 to 1,020 fms. 



Dentalium (Laevidentalium) coruscum n. sp PI. V, figs. 42, 43. 



Shell well curved, thin-walled at the oral end, somewhat thickened 

 at the apex, circular in section throughout; the greatest diameter 

 contained 11 times in the length. White. The surface is polished, 

 very faintly marked with growth-lines on the larger half. The apical 

 orifice is shortly ovate, the narrow end toward the convex side of the 

 shell, where there is a slight wave of the margin.

This form is related to D. leptosceles Watson, and luhricatum Sowb. 

 from Australia. My key to the species of Loevidentalium brings it to 

 the latter species except in the matter of size, luhricatum being about 

 double the dimensions of coruscum. This discrepancy, together with 

 the widely separated habitats of the two forms, indicates specific 

 diversity. 



The curvature, measured from a chord connecting the ends, to the 

 greatest convexity of the outer curve, is 4 mm., about one-eighth the 

 length of the shell. 



Dentalium (Rhabdus) cerinum n. sp. PI. V, figs. 40, i\. 



The shell is thin, almost straight, circular in section at the anal end, 

 barely perceptibly compressed from side to side at the oral end ; slender, 

 the greatest diameter contained about 17 times in the length; trans- 

 lucent whitish. The surface is glossy, sculptured with very fine rather 

 close and regular circular impressed lines and some coarser more widely 

 spaced impressions indicating periods of growth-arrest. 



Both apertures are simple, without slit or notch.

This species is allied to D. rectius Cpr. and cequatorium Pils. and Shp., 

 but differs from both in its distinct though extremely minute annular 

 sculpture. It is a typical Rhabdus, and the first to be found in Japan- 

 ese waters. 



Siliqua intuspurpurea n- sp. PI. V, figs. 82, 33. 



Shell regularly oblong, compressed, entirely covered with a glossy 

 cuticle, green-yellow with darker olive concentric streaks, becoming 

 purple toward the beaks, which, however, are white or whitish. The 

 surface is lightly marked with growth-lines, and has a group of indis- 

 tinct rays, composed of short, minute wrinkles in the direction of 

 growth-lines, in the middle; and the dorsal surface posterior to the 

 beaks is densely sculptured with minute raised radial lines. Upper 

 and lower margins about equally convex ; posterior end slightly trun- 

 cate obliquely; anterior end rounded. Beaks at the anterior three- 

 tenths of the length. Ligament short, black-brown, and prominent. 

 Interior purple, the rib strong, straight and nearly vertical, whitish- 

 purple. Pallial sinus extending anteriorly two-fifths the total length, 

 its lower margin coalescent with the pallial line. Two cardinal teeth 

 in each valve.

The shell is oval, rather solid, white under a glossy cuticle. Drab 

 with lighter concentric streaks, becoming pale yellow near the base 

 and ends, and rather indistinctly marked with drab rays. Surface 

 everywhere closely but irregularly concentrically plicate-striate. 

 Under a strong lens a dense microscopic sculpture of papillae and lines 

 parallel to growth-lines is seen to cover the riblcts and intervals. 

 The dorsal and basal margins are about equally convex, the dorsal 

 margin anterior to the beaks is nearly straight, the anterior end being 

 rather narrowly rounded. The lunule is rather narrow, flat, bounded 

 by a slightly impressed line. The interior is pure white, dull; the pal- 

 lial sinus rather short and rounded. Teeth are rather slender. ]\Iar- 

 gins of the valves are smooth and partly covered by the inflexed 

 cuticle.

1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 119 



This delicately colored clam is remarkably handsome for so northern 

 a species. It has some resemblance to Macrocallista pacifica (Dillw.), a 

 species better known as Meretrix (or Callista) chinensis Chemn., but 

 that species is smaller, more oblong and smoother, and it is more or 

 less marked with purple. 



A somewhat larger specimen of M. chishimana, measuring length 78, 

 alt. 57, diam. 32.5 mm., was contained in a collection of shells of 

 unknown locality, but all species of Yesso and northward, which has 

 been in the Academy many years. 



Dr. William H. Dall has shown that the well-known and appropriate 

 name Callista cannot be used for this Venerid group, but I believe no 

 one has noticed that it was originally based upon the single species 

 Madra neapolitana Poli {Test. utr. Sicil, I, pp. 67 and xi, 1791). In 

 a later volume Poli added several species of Veneridce; but subsequent 

 additions do not affect a name based upon a single species. Callista 

 Poli i^ therefore a synonym of Madra s. str. 

 Lithophaga lithura n. sp. PL V, figs. 37, S8, 39. 



The shell is thin, cylindrical, brown, and sculptured with growth- 

 lines only under a smooth, thin, gray-white calcareous layer, which 

 almost completely envelopes it. The low beaks are very near the 

 anterior end. The hinge-margin is but little raised, hardly modifying 

 the cylindric contour, but the height of the shell diminishes slightly 

 toward both ends. The anterior end is narrowly rounded, the pos- 

 terior end abruptly and squarely truncate. The calcareous layer thick- 

 ened at the posterior end, where it projects, is abruptly narrowed, and 

 is excavated on the inner faces, and continued in narrow posterior projec- 

 tions. The valves arc flesh-tinted within, becoming blackish-purple 

 at the posterior end .

 and their mucronate, internally excavated, stony tails. 

 Trapezium japonicum u- sp. PI. V, figs. 34, 35, 36. 



The shell is rather solid, oblong, the altitude nearly half the length, 

 the beaks at the anterior sixth or seventh of the length. Surface dull 

 and earthy, whitish with some red or livid stains, and roughened by 

 growth-wrinkles which are most strongly marked posteriorly. Only 

 small remnants of a thin cuticle remain near the ventral margin. Dorsal

margin convex, basal margin straight or a little concave (as in Mar- 

 garitana margaritifera). Beaks low. No kmule. Escutcheon flat or 

 slightly concave, lanceolate, very long, extending to the posterior end 

 of the dorsal margin, bounded by acute elevated ridges. Interior white, 

 often stained with violet in the cavity, or with some faint rays of the 

 same color, or in some specimens it is delicately flesh-tinted, ochraceous 

 toward the lower margin posteriorly. There is always a broad dark 

 dorsal and posterior tract, dull violet in the cavity, but glossy blackish- 

 purple between the posterior adductor scar and the posterior margin. 

 There are three cardinal teeth, parallel to the long axis of the shell, in 

 the right valve, the anterior one much the larger; the posterior tooth 

 separated from the others, long and slender, lamellar. In the left 

 valve there are also three, the anterior one very small. There Ls a 

 short, strong lateral tooth in the right valve, a socket above it receiving 

 a small process of the other valve.

This does not seem closely related to any Trapezium I have found 

 described. There is a Cypricardia formosensis Dsh. enumerated in 

 Paetel's Catalog (III Abth., 94, 1890), without reference, which I 

 have been unable to trace. The name Trapezium is prior to the 

 equivalent terms Cypricardia Lam. and Libitina Schum. 

 Trapezium japonicum delioatum n. subsp. PI. v, fig. 44. 



Similar in contour to T. japonicum, but thinner and smaller. The 

 shell is partially covered with a very delicate corneous cuticle, decidu- 

 ous toward the beaks; dull ashen, in large part stained with violet. 

 Posterior half sculptiu-ed with delicate, subobsolete radial striae, scarcely 

 visible toward the margins except by being set with delicate, very 

 minute and short cuticular spines. Interior dark livid purplish 

 throughout, but darker at the posterior end. Lateral teeth very small.

Besides the differences given above, the escutcheon in this species 

 is usually very asymmetrical, being much narrower in the left valve, 

 where its limiting keel is nearly straight, while in T. japonicum it is 

 nearly symmetrical.

Pecten awajiensis n. sp. 



Shell solid, equilateral, both valves moderately convex, the right 

 valve less so ; lower half semicircular, the upper half straightly tapering. 

 Convex valve dull purplish-white with purple-brown clouding and a few 

 small white spots in the furrows. The other valve is light brown with 

 some darker zones, and more white in the grooves. 



Ears large, the posterior slightly longer. Ribs 17, high and rounded, 

 and slightly wider than the intervals in the left valve, decidedly so in 

 the right, where their margins slightly overhang the intervals. Growth- 

 striae fine, close and inconspicuous. Ears finely costellate. Anterior 

 and posterior dorsal surfaces of the main disk flattened and smoothish. 

 Interior white and strongly grooved, calloused above the muscle scar. 

 Ctenolium short, of five teeth.

 14, fig. 71), from which it differs chiefly by the much coarser and less 

 numerous ribs. 17 instead of 23 or 24. The dorsal half of the shell is 

 also more wedge-shaped than in the Singapore scallop, of which a

I. — Introduction. 



The morphology of the compound eye has puzzled zoologists for 

 years, and much work has been done on the subject, but so diverse 

 are the views held by the various investigators in the field that we are 

 far from a final solution of the problem. With a view to adding some 

 evidence from the embryological point of view this work was begun, 

 in the belief that a detailed examination of this one insect eye would 

 throw some light on the adult morphology. 



The eye of the common honey bee. Apis meUifcra; is particularly 

 favorable for embryological work, since its growth is gradual and the 

 steps of development well marked out. The material is also easily 

 obtained, and the various stages of growth can be distinguished by 

 the external appearance of the larvae and pupse. It is also favorable for 

 a comparison with the development of the eye of Vespa, which was 

 described by Patten, since it is desirable to find how far his results 

 can be verified on a closely related form. The large number of omma- 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



tidia in each eye make the preparation of sections an easier matter, 

 since it was not necessary to cut so many eyes. 



The adult ommatidium of the bee was briefly described and figured 

 by Grcnacher in his celebrated work, Sehorgan der Arthropoden (1879), 

 and has been figured in works on apiculture, but has never been fully 

 worked out in the adult condition, and no work has been done on the 

 development of the eye. Biitschli (1860) in his work on the embryol- 

 ogy of the bee discusses the formation of the eye, but does not go into 

 the subject of the development of the ommatidium. 



This work was taken up with a view to getting, first of all, a complete 

 description of the development and structure, and in addition to get 

 some light on certain problems which are of especial interest from a 

 theoretical standpoint. The innervation of the ommatidium, the 

 method of formation and fundamental plan of the ommatidium, the 

 method of modification of numerical plan and structure in the evolu- 

 tion, the arrangement of ommatidia, the homology of various cells 

 in different ommatidia, and the comparison of ommatidia with other 

 sense-organs are questions which have been much discussed, and in 

 this work an effort has been made to apply the observations made to 

 the solution of these problems. This is done not without the realization 

 that some of these things can be settled only from wide comparisons, 

 but with the thought that a piece of work which takes in the whole 

 course of development is of more value than superficial observations 

 of a large number of forms. Some of the theories are merely matters 

 of interpretation rather than of direct observation, and must remain 

 so until decisive observations are made, but in matters of this kind the 

 accumulation of evidence is of decided value. 



The formation of the optic lobes and the course of the nervous ele- 

 ments through them are problems which have not been taken up for 

 investigation in this work. Kenyon has worked out the structure of 

 the optic lobes for Apis in detail with nerve methods. The technique 

 u>sed in the present work not being suitable for the tracing of nerves, 

 only on matters concerning the nerve endings of the retinula has any 

 investigation been made in this work, and that was not done by 

 Kenyon. 



In the matter of nomenclature an effort has been made to avoid the 

 use of new names or of some of the names which have been proposed 

 by some workers who have special theories to uphold, such as calyx, 

 lentigen, corneagen, etc. In the case of the cells which surround the 

 cone I have used the name corneal pigment cells, since they have a 

 double function. In other cases I have used generally accepted names. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 125 



The plan followed in this paper is to give, first, a brief description 

 of the adult eye, so that further discussion will be more intelligible, 

 and then to take up the development of the entire eye and omma- 

 tidium, followed by a detailed description of the adult conditions, 

 since that was the plan followed during investigation, and is, perhaps, 

 the order which will be most clear to the reader. 



This work was taken up at the suggestion of Dr. Thos. H. Mont- 

 gomery, Jr., now Professor of Zoology in the University of Texas, 

 and was completed under the supervision of Professor E. G. Conklin. 

 To both I am indebted for many valuable suggestions and for help 

 throughout the work. 



II. — Methods. 



Larvse and pupse were fixed in Flemming's fluid, Hermann's fluid, 

 picro-sulphuric, picro-acetic and picric acid saturated in 50 per cent, 

 alcohol, but of these the Flemming and Hermann preparations yielded 

 the best results. For the smaller larvse it was not necessary to dissect 

 before fixation, but for older larvse and pupae the head was removed 

 to make penetration easier. For adult material, where penetration 

 is difficult, the best fixative was acetic acid, generally a 10 per cent. 

 or 20 per cent, acetic solution in 80 per cent, to 100 per cent, alcohol. 

 Kleinenberg's picro-sulphuric and picric acid in 50 per cent, alcohol 

 were also used with fair results when the head was cut in two. 



The material was all cut in paraffine, and it was found that for adult 

 material long embedding was necessary, four to eight hours, to get the 

 paraffine all through the tissues. Some material was embedded for a 

 shorter time to see whether the heat had produced any artifacts in the 

 other material which was embedded for the longer period, but in such 

 cases the lens invariably separated from the retinular layer; no differ- 

 ence was observed in the internal tissues due to long heating. 



In staining, the best results were obtained in the use of Heidenhain's 

 iron hsematoxylin, with the use of a strong mordant for a long time. 

 For material of this kind there seems to be no better stain. It was 

 found that by destaining to different degrees the various parts of the 

 eye would show differences in color, the rhabdome, for example, stain- 

 ing an intense black in rather deeply stained material. The nerve 

 fibrils of the retinula cells also stained black with this stain. Other 

 stains, such as Delafield's hsematoxylin and eosine or Bordeaux red, 

 were employed with very good results. 



For depigmenting Grenacher's solution with a somewhat greater 

 per cent, of acid was used. Parker's solution was also used, though 

 the former gave the better results.

III. — Adult Form of Eve and Ommatidium. 



Before takint^ up the emljryonic development of the eye, it may l)e 

 well to give a short description of the adult form so that what follows 

 concerning the embryology may be more clear. 



The compound eye is made up of great nimibers of similar ommatidia 

 surroimded ])y pigment cells. Among the pigment cells lying between 

 the ommatidia are large numbers of hair cells which secrete the long 

 unbranched haii's which cover the surface of the eye. The entire eye 

 is covered by a layer of chitin, continuous with the chitin of the body 

 wall. 



Each ommatidium is composed of an external lens, a crj^stalline 

 cone and a rhabdome surrounded by eight or occasionally nine long 

 retinular cells which extend from the cone to the basement membrane. 

 Besides these are two pigment cells, the corneal pigment cells, which 

 surround the crystalline cone and about twelve which run the entire 

 length of the ommatidium from the lens to the basement membrane, 

 making in all about twenty-eight cells to each ommatidium. It might 

 be well to include in this enumeration a retinular ganglion cell, since 

 there is probably one to each ommatidium. The lens is chitinous and 

 quite thick and complicated in structure, as will be shown later. The 

 crystalline cone is composed of four highly modified cells, whose nuclei 

 have almost entirely disappeared, and the cells are modified internally 

 by the accumulation of an intercellular secretion which is more dense 

 than the original cytoplasm, but not so dense as the lens. The retinu- 

 lar cells begin at the apex of the cone, and from their proximal ends at 

 the basement membrane send in neural fibres to the retinular ganglion. 

 Each of the retinular cells has decome differentiated on its inner face 

 to form a part of the rhabdome which extends from the apex of the 

 cone to the distal side of the basement membrane. This rhabdome 

 is not chitinous, but is perfectly transparent and slightly more dense 

 than the surrounding cytoplasm. The corneal pigment cells and the 

 outer pigment cells which surround the entire ommatidium serve to 

 prevent the reflection of light in the ommatidium and the passage of 

 rays of light from one ommatidium to another. 



IV.— Embryology and Structure in Detail. 



1. The Entire Eye. 



The eye arises as a thickening of the hj^podermis on the side of the 

 head just posterior to the place where the antennae arise and just 

 over the optic ganglia. This thickening takes place before the larva 




1905.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



12^ 



is hatched from the egg and the newly hatched larva shows it clearly; 

 the boundaries of the eye are not as well marked as they become by 

 the time the larva is one day old. The optic ganglia are formed at 

 this time, as they arise very early in the development, but the retinu- 

 lar ganglia are not formed until a- later larval period.

This thickened laj-er of the hypodermis of the newly hatched larva 

 consists of columnar cells with their nuclei arranged at different levels, 

 giving the eye a pseudo-striated appearance. The cells at this time 

 all extend the same distance, so that the eye arises from a strictly one- 

 layered condition. At this time there is no connection with the optic

ganglia. During the larval growth the eye increases greatly in size 

 and mitotic figures are abundant, the mitosis always d viding the 

 cells lengthwise, so that the one-layered condition is retained until 

 the close of the larval period. 



During the semipupa stage, after the larva is sealed up by the 

 workers of the hive but before it assumes the true pupa form, the one- 

 layered epithelium gives place to a condition in which all the cells do 

 not extend all the way from the outer surface to the basement mem- 

 brane. This is brought about by the lengthening of some cells, the 

 shortening of others and by the rearrangement of the cells in a manner 

 to bf) described later. By the time the head has attained the size and 

 shape of the adult, the cells have arranged themselves so that the 

 ommatidia are completely formed and no more mitoses occur. The 

 development of the ommatidia from now on consists of the differentia- 

 tion of the cell elements until they assume their adult form. The 

 development of the eye as a W'hole consists of a thickening of the organ 

 and the laying down of a chitinous lens over the surface. 



At the sides of the eye of the young pupa the appearance is as shown 

 in text fig. 2, and the cells which correspond to the corneal pigment 

 cells around the ommatidia are quite numerous and shade off gradually 

 into the cells of the hypodermis over the rest of the head. As the eye 

 increases in thickness by the lengthening of the ommatidia there ap- 

 pears a dipping in of the cells of the border, so that there is an invagi- 

 nation all around the eye where the secreting surface of the hypodermis 

 is pulled down. This is shown by a thin sheet of chitin which runs 

 around the eye (seen in section, text fig. 1) in the late pupa and adult 

 eye. This chitin is similar to the chitin of the body proper, but not 

 like that over the eye. This invagination must not be confused with. 

 such an invagination as is described by Patten for the formation of the 

 lens layer, for the ommatidia are here completely formed and the cor- 

 neal pigment cells have moved to their place at the proximal end of 

 the cone before the dipping of the cells here described takes place. 



In the formation of the optic ganglia, which takes place by the 

 invagination of cells of the hypodermis, there is formed a brain sheath 

 — a sheath of cells covering the ganglia and still continuous with the 

 hypodermis at the edge of the eye. This layer of cells runs along 

 proximal to the basement membrane and very close to it in the pupa 

 stage. As the retinular ganglia take on their final shape these cells 

 are pushed away from the basement membrane, and are seen in the 

 adult eye as strands of cytoplasm woven in among the nerve fibres 

 between the basement membrane and the retinular ganglion. The 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 129 



nuclei of these cells are smaller and are easily distinguishable from the 

 retinular ganglion nuclei which lie near them (see text fig. 3). On 

 the edge of the nerve bundle this layer is continuous with the brain 

 sheath in the adult. The strands of protoplasm of which this layer of 

 cells is composed after it is perforated by the nerve fibres often run 

 up close to the basement membrane and might easily be mistaken for 

 nerve fibres to the outer pigment cells, but their origin indicates that 

 they are not nerves and there is no indication of any nervous connec- 

 tion for the pigment cells. 



Kenyon recognized this layer of cells, which he describes as follows ■} 

 "The outer mass (first fibrillar mass) presents a lunar appearance in 

 frontal sections (see fig. 1 of this paper), and lies close inside the base- 

 ment membrane of the retina, being separated from it by sufficient 

 space for the entrance of large tracheal sacs and a thin layer of cells 

 commingled with the fibres from the retina." It will be seen that 

 working with nerve methods this author did not recognize them as 

 nerve fibres, nor did he describe any nervous connection with the pig- 

 ment cells. Frequently these strands of protoplasm run close to the 

 basement membrane and there spread out as a pyramidal protoplasmic 

 mass lying between the nerve fibrils. This is particularly noticeable 

 in pupa stages before this layer of cells is so greatly distorted. 



The basement membrane is made up of a fusion of the proximal 

 ends of the outer pigment cells with the pigmented portion of the reti- 

 nular cells. This makes a sheet of cytoplasm, perforated where the 

 nerve fibres pass from the retinular cells, which can easily be macerated 

 away from the other elements of the eye and is easily distinguishable 

 on account of its deeply pigmented condition. The nerve fibres from 

 the retina pass through this and are seen as more or less separated on 

 a section through that region (fig. 18). This basement membrane is. 

 continuous with the basement membrane of the hypodermal cells'. 

 Fig. 10 shows diagrammatically the structure of the base of an omma- 

 tidium and the elements which compose the basement membrane, but 

 does not show the separation of nerve fibrils, since that is seen clearly 

 only in cross sections through that region. 



There are no tracheae distal to the basement membrane in the com- 

 pound eye of the bee such as have been described in other eyes, espe- 

 cially among the Diptera. Exception must be taken to the statement 

 of Hickson^ that " no spirally-marked tracheae penetrate the optic tract 

 at any part of its course in Hymenoptera." Between the basement

membrane and the retinular ganglion tracheae with spiral markings 

 occur in all specimens examined (see text fig. 3), but the statement of 



Hickson holds good for all other 

 parts of the optic tract as far 

 as has been observed. Kenyon 

 also mentions the presence of 

 tracheae in this region. 



2. Arrangement of Ommatidia. 



ret.gar>5.a 



Fig. 3. — Section below basement mem- 

 brane, showing retinular ganglion cells 

 and nerve fibrils from ommatidia. 



The facets of the lens are 

 arranged in hexagons, as is true 

 for so many insect eyes, but this 

 is probably not a primitive con- 

 dition. Hexagonal arrangement 

 is what is produced whenever 

 any circular objects are closely 

 pressed together, just as the cells of the honeycomb are hexagonal, 

 and this undoubtedly explains the shape and arrangement of the 

 facets. Parker (for Crustacea) looks upon unfaceted eyes as primi- 

 tive, and probably this is true for insects also. We have, however, 

 in the proximal portion of the eye a different arrangement which 

 is perhaps more primitive than the hexagonal method. At any 

 level proximal to the cone cells the ommatidia are arranged in parallel 

 rows, and the nearer we come to the base of the ommatidia the 

 clearer is this arrangement, until on a section at the level of the base- 

 ment membrane (fig. 18) we see this parallel arrangement very 

 marked. Since here we get a condition in which the ommatidia are 

 not pressed together and therefore are not modified mechanically, 

 it probably represents a more primitive condition than that found 

 in the lens region. In the pupa, even the facets do not have as marked 

 a hexagonal arrangement as they have later, and in the larva we get 

 an arrangement identical with that of the bases of the adult ommatidia. 

 The numerical plan and shape of the parts of the ommatidium may 

 have something to do with the arrangement. The retinular cells are 

 eight in number, but four of these are wider than those which alternate 

 with them, and as a result a cross-section of the retina is roughly a 

 square. The outer pigment cells are twelve in number when their 

 arrangement is unmodified by hair cells, and this number readily ar- 

 ranges itself into a square with three on a side, or into a hexagon with 

 two on a side. Since the outer pigment cells are simply strands of 

 cytoplasm they readily accommodate themselves to an}^ change of 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



arrangement and are not, as a rule, without some bend, so these cells 

 could scarcely modify an ommatidial plan of arrangement. The base- 

 ment membrane is considerably smaller in area than the lens chitin, 

 and as a result the room provided for each ommatidium is considerably 

 decreased, so that in contrast with what has been stated, that the 

 ommatidia are not so crowded proximal to the cone, it might be sup- 

 posed that the converse would be true. However, the fact is that in 

 cross-section a larger proportion of space is occupied by outer pigment 

 cells, the interommatidial spaces, near the base of the ommatidia than 

 near the lens; and since, as above stated, these cells are flexible and 

 not crowded, it scarcely seems to follow that this parallel arrangement 

 is due to crowding. 



The hexagonal arrangement is undoubtedly the common plan, at 

 least as far as the lens is concerned, and the tetragonal arrangement 

 may be derived from it as held by Parker, and his arguments for such 

 an origin seem good ; but, on the other hand, the hexagonal arrangement 

 could scarcely give rise to the tetragonal unless preceding the hex- 

 agonal facets the ommatidia were in squares, so that the secondary 

 crowding would bring about the primitive arrangement again. Taking 

 again the case of the honeycomb, no additional crowding could possibly 

 make the cells square, for the more the circular walls (the primitive 

 cells) are crowded the more truly they become hexagonal. However, 

 if the walls were made of four parts, as is the cone, and if they were 

 fastened at their bases in parallel rows, then additional crowding might 

 cause the lens to lose its circular outline and become square, in which 

 case the hexagonal arrangement of the lens would be lost. It seems 

 probable that the cone determines the arrangement rather than the 

 lens-secreting cells, and Parker's figures of Gonodactylus (Parker, 1890, 

 PI. VIII, fig. 93), in which the tetragonal arrangement is found in the 

 large ommatidia and not in the small ones, lend support to this view. 



To sum up, it seems probable that the arrangement of ommatidia, 

 where they are sufficient in number to be said to have any plan at all, 

 is normally the tetragonal plan. If the cones are somewhat com- 

 pressed, as they generally are on account of the way in which a com- 

 pound eye is made up, a hexagonal arrangement of the distal parts of 

 the ommatidia results; but if the pressure is sufficient to cause the 

 cone to lose its circular form then it becomes a square, and the facet 

 plan again becomes tetragonal. 



3. Hair Cells. 



The entire lens of the eye of the bee, especially in the younger 

 individuals, is covered with large hairs, unlike those of the rest of 




132

the bod}^ in being unbranched. These hairs are secreted by large 

 hair-mother cells which lie among the outer pigment cells between 

 the ommatidia, and their development is of interest on account

of the presence in them of an intracellular duct and because of their 

 binucleated condition. In the larval eye these hair cells cannot be 

 definitely located, but there are certain large cells with peculiar nuclei 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



which are probably hair cells. In the early pupa these cells are large 

 and have two, or sometimes three, nuclei, l^ut when a third nucleus is 

 present it is considerably smaller than the two more distally placed 

 ones. In the early stages this polynucleated cell contains an intra- 

 cellular duct which opens into the tubular hair, and through this duct 

 passes the secretion products of the cell for the formation of the hair. 

 The hair proper is tubular and in material stained in iron hsematoxylin 

 darker lines appear in the walls, and these structures extend for a short 

 distance down into the cell proper around the duct. The duct has 

 well-marked boundaries, does not branch, and generally coils around 

 the second nucleus (text fig. 4). 



As the lens increases in thickness the hairs elongate by the secretion 

 of the hair cells, and as this goes on the cytoplasm of the cell is used 

 up, until finally, in the adult eye, the cell has about one-sixth the 

 volume it had in the early pupal eye. In the intracellular duct and 

 in the hair duct the products of secretion may be observed in fixod 

 material as darker bodies of irregular shape. 



These hairs and hair cells have no nerve connection, as far as I can 

 observe, and are therefore not sensory hairs. Just why the entii'e eye 

 should be covered by hairs is hard to explain, for they must undoubted- 

 ly obscure vision, and since such a hindrance is present we should 

 expect to find it compensated for by some sensory function on the part 

 of the hair. I can find no indication that such is the case. It is worthy 

 of note that the older bees have lost most of the hairs both on the eyes 

 and on the body by the time they need the eyes for prolonged flight. 

 The younger bees, up to nearly three weeks of age, leave the hive but 

 rarely, and then for short distances only, but the older bees which take 

 long journeys have the eyes much more bare. It is also noticeable 

 that all the bees, but especially the drones, brush the hairs so that they 

 all point down toward the mouth just before leaving the hive entrance. 

 No doubt, in the hive, the head, which is so frequently put into the 

 cells, becomes soiled with honej^ and pollen, and this action of brushing 

 may be merely to remove dirt; but, on the other hand, the arranging 

 of the partly transparent hairs in one direction may produce certain 

 results of refraction which are favorable. 



In Vanessa, Johansen describes hair cells as running the length of 

 the ommatidia without an intracellular duct and with but one nucleus. 

 He is able to locate these cells at an earlier stage than has been possible 

 for the bee on account of the proximal position of the nucleus. From 

 the figure of a cross-section of the cornea it would appear that these 

 cells are not so abundant as in Apis. Patten figures hair cells for 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Vespa very similar to those here described, but I am unable to find 

 the nerve connections which he describes. Semper and Breitenbach 

 also describe such hair cells for Lepidoptera. 



The number of facets in the different kinds of individuals of the col- 

 ony differs considerably. The drones (males) have an extremely 

 large number of ommatidia, the eyes meeting on the top of the head, 

 aiid as a result the three ocelli are crowded down to the front of the 

 head. The workers and queens have a considerably smaller number, 

 about one-third as many, and the ocelli are located at the top of the 

 head. It is not clear why the drones should have a larger number of 

 ommatidia than the females of the colony, since they do not seem to 

 need so much larger range of vision. The only reason which might 

 be suggested from a knowledge of the habits of the two sexes is that 

 at the time when the queen takes her "mating flight" she flies almost 

 directly upward, after a preliminary circle or two near the hive, and 

 then often flies to some distance from the hive ; this manner of flying 

 making more probable a mating with a drone from some other colony 

 than her own. Drones do not, as a rule, fly as high as does the queen, 

 and it would be advantageous to have the eyes extending to the top 

 of the head in order to follow the queen's flight. As soon as a queen 

 starts upward any drones which are flying near at hand start upward 

 after her, the eyes on the top of the head making it possible for them 

 to see her. 



To say that this difference has arisen on this account scarcely seems 

 justifiable, for it would seem easier for natural selection, sexual selec- 

 tion, or whatever other factor is potent here, to modify the habits of 

 flight rather than to enlarge an organ so much as in this case. This 

 much may, however, be said with a good deal of surety: two things 

 which would be likely to be acted on by selection in the bee are acute- 

 ness and range of vision and the power of flight. 



V. — Retinular Ganglion. 



In the early larval stages the optic ganglia are clearly marked out, 

 but the retinular ganglia arc not. The only indication of the retinular 

 ganglia is a number of cells which lie near the basement membrane of 

 the eye, principally at the posterior margin. During the larval growth 

 the nerve fibres from the ommatidia grow in from the retinular cells, 

 and as this growth goes on the cells of what are to be the retinular 

 ganglia are pushed farther away from the basement membrane and 

 assume their more definite position. Finally, in the adult animal the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



nerve fibres from the ommatidia form a relatively compact mass and 

 the retiniilar ganglion cells are scattered through the fibres in such a 

 way as to have the appearance of a definite ganglion. The nuclei of 

 the retinular ganglion are no longer nearly in one plane, but are scat- 

 tered for a considerable distance between the basement membrane 

 and the outer fibrillar mass due to the crowding of the nerve fibres. 



The question naturally arises as to the number of cells of the retinular 

 ganglion as compared with the number of ommatidia. A count is, 

 of course, impossible, but careful examination reveals that there can- 

 not be many more than one to an ommatidium, certainly not one to 

 each retinular cell. The eight nerve fibres from each group of retinular 

 cells are entirely separate, but lie close together, so that probably one 

 and only one retinular ganglion cell receives the impulse carried from 

 the retina on eight nerve processes, and consecutive cross-sections indi- 

 cate that the eight nerve fibrils surround the thick part of the retinular 

 ganglion cell where the nucleus is located and transmit the impulse by 

 contact. 



In his description of this region Kenyon says:^ "The elements 

 from the retina terminate each in a small tuft of fine branches in the 

 outer fibrillar body, and come in contact with the fine lateral branchlets 

 given off in the same region by fibres originating from the cells of Ber- 

 ger's granular layer (retinular ganglion)." The tuft of fine branches 

 here mentioned are the separate nerve fibres from the retinulae. I have 

 been unable to see the fine branches of the retinular ganglion cells. 



The retinular ganglion cell in turn sends in its fibre through the first 

 fibrillar mass, and then through the outer chiasma to the opposite 

 side of the group of ganglia, where the impulse is given over to a cell 

 of the first optic ganglion. From here on the tracing of the fibres 

 requires special nerve methods which were not employed in this work. 

 However, this much is evident : the cells of the first optic ganglion send 

 their fibres through the second fibrillar mass and through the inner 

 chiasma to the second optic ganglion, where the impulse is probably 

 again transferred to another cell which, in turn, carries it to the brain. 

 The course of these fibres has been worked out in detail by Kenyon 

 (1897), and in my work I find nothing to contradict his results, although 

 the methods used in my work were not such as to warrant either a 

 positive denial or confirmation of his work.

VI. — The Ommatidium. 



1. The Larva. 



In the larva, just^after being hatched from the egg, I have been 

 unable to find any indication of the grouping of cells which are later to 

 go together to form a single ommatidium. The eye at this time is a 

 simple layer of the thickened hypodermis with the nuclei arranged one 

 above the other. At this time, and throughout the entire larval period, 

 mitotic figures are abundant, the spindles always having their axes 

 at right angles to the length of the cell and dividing the cells lengthwise.

 Cross-section at a lower level, d. Cross-section of a very young 

 larva, each division line representing a complete ommatidium. 



The division figures seem to be more abundant near the outer surface 

 of the epithelium. 



About one day after leaving the egg, when the larva has about 

 doubled in size, a tangental section of the eye at right angles to the 

 long axes of the cells at the outer surface reveals a grouping of cells 

 as represented in text fig. bd. The lines in this figure do not represent 

 cell boundaries but are the boundaries of groups of cells; each group 

 contains four or five cells at this time, the nuclei of these cells being 

 directly one above the other. The cell groups are tetragonal and are 

 arranged roughly in parallel rows. In longitudinal section these groups 

 appear as made up of long strands with superimposed nuclei about the 

 diameter of the entire width of the group of cells. That these are the 

 beginnings of the ommatidia is evident since they can be traced through 




1905.] NATURAL SCIEN-CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



all the larval stages to the pupa, where the ommatidia are definitely 

 marked. This is further indicated by the fact that they are arranged 

 in the same way as are the proximal ends of the ommitidia, even m 

 the adult eye. It should be borne in mind that this epithelium is 

 strictly one-layered, and this is true all through the larval period. 



During the larval period, as above stated, mitotic figures are abun- 

 dant, and as a result of these divisions the groups come to be composed 

 of more and more cells, but it is not until a late larval period (about 

 four and a half days from the hatching of the egg for worker larva) 

 that any further differentiation is observable, except possibly that the 

 nuclei of some of the cells are larger than others in the same group. 

 At this late larval period the cells arrange themselves as a spindle- 

 shaped mass surrounded by smaller cells whose smaller nuclei he m 

 the space left at the outer end of the spindle. .Mitotic figures are now 

 absent except an occasional one in the smaller cells, but so far none 

 have been observed in the larger centrally placed cells of the group. 

 The number of cells in the spindle is hard to determine, since the 

 nuclei are at different levels and the cell boundaries are not visible. 

 All the nuclei of the central bundle of cells are some distance below the 

 surface. There are certainly, however, not more than eight or nine, the 

 number of retinular cells of the adult ommatidium. At the distal 

 end of this spindle a differentiation of cytoplasm takes place, and a 

 clear space is formed in the centre of the cells in the very granular 

 protoplasm, and this I believe to be the beginning of the rhabdome. 

 A cross-section near the outer surface of the cell mass shows this clear 

 space surrounded by granular cytoplasm of the spindle cells, and this 

 in turn surrounded by nuclei arranged around the central bundle. 

 These outer nuclei are not as yet differentiated, so that their future 

 fate cannot be determined. The cells of the spindle by this time have 

 sent out protoplasmic processes toward the optic lobes which become 

 the nerve fibres of the ommatidium, so that at any rate some of the 

 spindle becomes the retinula. 



Several facts seem to indicate that the spindle-shaped centre of the 

 ommatidium goes to form only the retinula: (1) There are no nuclei 

 near the outer surface, as one would expect were crystalline cone cells 

 to be formed from any of the cells; (2) there are not enough cells to 

 form both retinula and crystalline cone cells, and since no mitotic 

 figures have been observed they have undoubtedly ceased division; 

 (3) a clear space is formed at the distal end of the spindle by a differen- 

 tiation of the cytoplasm, possibly the beginning of the rhabdome, since 

 it is in this portion of the retinula that the rhabdome is seen in the 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



youngest pupal eye observed (just after the semipupa stage). The 

 number of nuclei around the spindle throws no light on this, since they 

 are still dividing occasionally and their number in the adult is not 

 fixed. 



Considerable stress has been laid on the fate of this spindle-shaped 

 mass of cells, since the determination of this fact alone is of such great 

 importance in the consideration of the morphology of the ommatidium. 

 That the outer pigment cells are morphologically peripheral to the 

 crystalline cone and retinula no one would deny. The position of the 

 corneal pigment cells might be a doubtful point if they were derived 

 from a separate layer of cells formed by invagination of the entire eye, 

 but as no such invagination occurs in the bee, and as at an early pupa 

 stage they are clearh^ outside the cone, I think there can be no doubt 

 as to their morphological position. The question as to the relative 

 morphological position of the crystalline cone cells and the retinular 

 cells is, however, not so clear. 



According to Grenacher the ommatidium is two-layered, and the 

 lens and cone are morphologically distinct from the retina. If this 

 view is held, then the question stated above does not exist; but such 

 an interpretation can no longer be held on comparative anatomical 

 or embryological grounds, as has been shown so well by numerous in- 

 vestigators, the evidence for which it is not necessary to give here. 

 Suffice it to say that, as has been shown previously, the ommatidium of 

 Apis arises from a one-layered epithelium, and all the cells are morpho- 

 logically equivalent. Taking into consideration, then, only such views 

 as are based on such interpretations, we find two opposing theories. 



According to Patten, Kingsley and others, the crystalline cone is 

 sometimes continuous with the rhabdome; these two would therefore 

 be the morphological centre of the ommatidium, while the retinula 

 must arise from colls outside this. When the crystalline cone is not 

 continuous with the rhabdome. Patten still considers the cone as the 

 centre, since he describes processes running from each cone cell around 

 the rhabdome but inside the retinula (as in Vespa). To this interpre- 

 tation those investigators who consider the crystalline cone as the 

 terminus of the nerve fibres would probably agree. On the other 

 hand, Watase holds that the ommatidium is a morphological invagina- 

 tion of which the retinula is the centre, and the cone cells, lens cells 

 (homologous with the corneal pigment cells of Apis) and pigment cells 

 follow in the order named. By this interpretation the rhabdome, cone 

 substance and lens are homodynamous. These two views seem in no 

 way reconcilable, and more investigation is necessary to decide between 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



them, since it scarcely seems probable that both plans exist, since all 

 ommatidia are probably the result of one kind of development. 



Patten bases his view on the fact that the cone cells are continuo\is 

 with and part of the rhabdome, but surely in Apis there is no such 

 continuity, since all through the development they are separate, and in 

 the adult eye there is a sharp line of demarcation between them, and 

 they also react very differently to stains. In Vespa, Patten admits 

 that the rhabdome is not continuous with the crystalline cone cells, but 

 in this case he describes processes between the rhabdome and retinula 

 which correspond to the processes which form the rhabdome in other 

 forms. Since, as will be discussed later, the rhabdome is really part 

 of the retinula, being formed as an intracellular secretion, any such 

 process from the cone cells would have to pierce the retinula cells to 

 occupy such a position. No such processes occur in Apis. If such a 

 view be held because it is necessary in some way for the nerve fibres to 

 reach the crystalline cone, on the assumption that the nerves end there, 

 such a necessity disappears, for, as will be shown under a discussion 

 of the innervation of the ommatidium, the cone is in no way a nerve 

 terminus. Such a theory of innervation does not seem justified for 

 any ommatidium, and therefore the necessity for this conception of 

 the morphology disappears. 



On the other hand Watase based his view largely on the eye of 

 Limulus. This view commends itself on account of its extreme sim- 

 plicity, since all ommatidia readily lend themselves to the plan of 

 diagrammatic representation used by Watase with this interpretation. 

 Watase seems to have advanced this theory rather for the purpose of 

 giving some explanation for the existence of the rhabdome than for 

 the morphology of the entire ommatidium. There is, I think, no reason 

 to believe that the rhabdome was ever a chitinous substance, and in 

 that sense it is not homologous with the lens. In the ommatidium, 

 as we now know it, the rhabdome is an intracellular secretion full of 

 nerve fibrils, and is far from being a hard chitinous growth. To that 

 extent, then, Watase's conception seems an error. If, however, we 

 look on the lens, cone substance and rhabdome as secretions (non- 

 living protoplasmic differentiations), of which the lens only is an extra- 

 cellular secretion, then the homology may hold. Acording to this 

 view, then, the ommatidium did not arise as a pit filled with chitin, 

 but rather the sinking in of certain cells, with a corresponding retention 

 of the secretion inside the cell, has taken place with the assumption of 

 new functions. Parker has argued that the retinular cells cannot be 

 considered as homologous with the lens secreting cells, since the lens 




140 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



cells secrete on their distal surface while the retinular cells secrete on 

 their lateral surfaces. My observations show that both cone cells and 

 retinular cells form their secretions intracellularly and from their very 

 positions they could not secrete on their distal surfaces, but this does 

 not seem to me to be any objection to the theory of Watase, since in 

 the invagination of the cells and the taking on of new functions new 

 forms of metabolic activity might easily be acquired. 



Since, however, in the emtoyonic development of the ommatidium of 

 the bee we find a stage in which the retinula is formed without cone 

 cells on the distal end and with the rhabdome partly formed, the only 

 inference, it seems to me, is that the cone arises from lateral cells, and 

 the corneal and outer pigment cells are, of course, still more peripheral. 

 From this, then, it seems to follow that the conception of Watase con- 

 cerning the morphology of the ommatidium is the correct one. There 

 is, so far as has been observed, no real invagination, but such a thing 

 would scarcely be expected in so compact an organ; neither have I 

 observed the actual overgrowing of the cone cells, but the conclusion 

 seems inevitable that the retinula is the centre of the ommatidium. 



Some compound eyes have been described in which, in the adult eye, 

 the retinular cells extend outside the cone to the lens. Such cases are 

 fouad when the number of pigment cells is reduced or when they are . 

 entirely wanting, and it is safe to assume that the distal lengthening 

 has taken place secondarily, late in development. From the migration 

 of the corneal pigment cells of the ommatidium of the bee, to be de- 

 scribed later, we sec that a late rearrangement is possible, and it seems 

 more plausible to assume that such cases are a secondary modification 

 rather than that there are two ground plans of ommatidia, one of 

 which has its retinula centrally placed, the other has the cone cells 

 inside the retinula as the axis. 



The retinular spindle of the larva resembles in appearance various 

 sense buds throughout the animal kingdom, such as taste buds and 

 lateral line organs of vertebrates, the aesthetes of Chitons, etc. These 

 sense buds often have some marked differentiation of the cytoplasm 

 internal!}^ to enable the peripheral organ to perform its function. This 

 similarity is more than superficial, however, for the method of innerva- 

 tion which will be described in detail later is from the sense cell toward 

 the central nervous system, and this is the method for many of these 

 sense buds, although the opposite direction of fibres is described for 

 some (e.g., taste buds). 



It is safe to assume that these sense buds are accumulations of 

 single sensory cells, such as are widely known {e.g., sensory epithelial 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



cells of Lumbricus, epithelial sensory cells [Flemming's cells] of Mol- 

 luscs), giving greater efficiency at a certain spot, and that the internal 

 differentiations are but secretions or cytoplasmic differentiations due 

 to the specialized condition of the cell. Granting these facts, then, 

 sense buds are homologous of necessity only in their origin from an 

 epidermal tissue, although the homology may be greater. Since sense 

 buds are known which are sensitive to touch, taste, smell, sight and 

 vibration waves, it seems entirely unnecessary to assume that a light- 

 perceiving organ, such as an ommatidium, has arisen as a modification 

 of some other kind of sense bud, rather than that it arose as an accumu- 

 lation of epithelial cells already sensitive to light. 



Since we know that single cells are acted upon by light waves {e.g., 

 Protozoa), and that epidermal cells often give rise to nervous impulses 

 when acted upon by light {e.g., skin of the earth worm), there seems 

 no reason for assuming that the ommatidium has arisen other than by 

 an accumulation of such sensitive cells and then by invagination a 

 light-refracting organ has been formed over it. Such a view is directly 

 opposed to the view of Patten that the ommatidium is a hair-bearing 

 sense organ. As will be shown later, his theory is untenable on account 

 of the absence of the essential structure for such a homology — the hair. 

 There is not only no indication of such an organ for the eye, but no 

 need for such a complicated theory of the origin of these organs, since 

 easy transition steps from a single cell sensitive to light to the omma- 

 tidium are obtainable and such an origin seems far more probable. 



Johansen (1893), in his description of the development of the eye of 

 Vanessa urticoe L., figures and describes a spindle-shaped mass of cells 

 which is the ommatidium of the pupa when two days and one hour old. 

 He has also observed the same spindle mass in the young pupa of 

 Sphinx euphorhice. This differs from what I have described for Apis 

 in that the corneal pigment cells and cone cells lie distal to the retinula, 

 and I am led to conclude that he has observed a stage just after the 

 sinking in of the retinula, a stage which I am unable to describe for 

 Apis. At any rate his conception of the morphology agrees with 

 mine, since the retinula is in the centre of the ommatidium and the 

 cone cells and corneal pigment cells are lateral to it. 



2. Pupa. 



During the so-called semi-pupa stage, just after the larva is 

 sealed up by the workers of the hive, and before the bee is a complete 

 pupa, very rapid growth takes place, and the eye increases still more in 

 size and becomes more and more differentiated until at the beginning 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



of the pupa stage proper the ommatidia are completely formed. The 

 exact method by which this differentiation takes place is difficult to 

 learn, since the growth at this time is so very rapid that it is practically 

 impossible to get all the stages. The head of the insect grows very 

 rapidly and the eyes keep pace with it. The retinular cells become 

 longer and broader, and the retinulae lie closer together. The cone and 

 corneal pigment cells come to lie at the distal end of the retinula by 

 the method previously described. When the pupa stage proper is 

 entered upon, the area of the eye is practically that of the adult eye. 



The various stages of the pupa period are easily distinguishable 

 externally, and this fact is of great value in the selection of material. 

 The eye is first white, like the rest of the body, then pink, then brown, 

 and finally, as the other parts of the body take on their adult colors, 

 black. These changes of color are due to the deposition of pigment 

 in the various cells of the ommatidium, pigment in the corneal pigment 

 cells being red in color, giving the first color externally, and the darker 

 pigments of the other cells obscuring this color at a later period. These 

 changes enable one to choose the desired material by simply uncapping 

 the cells containing pupse without removing the bee from its cell, since 

 the head is always toward the outside. 



From this stage on it becomes necessary to discuss the various parts 

 of the ommatidium separately. Such a method tends to give the im- 

 pression of a lack of continuity in mode and time of development, but 

 the drawings which accompany the description are made of the entire 

 ommatidiimi, and these will show the relative size and degree of devel- 

 opment at various stages. The order followed is from the retinula to 

 the more lateral cells. 



a. The Retinula. — The retinula cells are eight in number normally, 

 but numerous ommatidia are observed in which nine cells are present. 

 In the earliest pupa stage (fig. 3) these cells extend from the proximal 

 end (apex) of the cone cells to the basement membrane, and each cell 

 has a protoplasmic process extending through the openings in the base- 

 ment membrane toward the optic lobes, w^hich later functions as the 

 nervous connection of these cells with the cells of the retinular ganglion. 

 At this time the only indication of the rhabdome is the clear space at 

 the distal end which was described for the larval ommatidium; its 

 differentiation has gone on little, if any, during the rearrangement of 

 cells. The cytoplasm at the distal end of the cells is more granular 

 than elsewhere, and by the time the eye has reached the stage figured 

 pigment is laid down around the forming rhabdome. This is the first 

 pigment laid down in the ommatidium, but at almost the same time 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 143 



the corneal pigment cells acquire pigment. The spindle shape of the 

 retinula so marked in the larval condition is still retained, the retinula 

 being widest at about one-third of the distance from the cone cells to 

 the basement membrane. The relatively large nuclei of the retinula at 

 this time are near together, and in no definite arrangement in the thick- 

 est portion of the cell group. The cytoplasm of the cells is uniform 

 except as described for the distal end, and the cell membranes between 

 the various cells are not visible. The outside boundaries of the 

 retinula group at this time and all through development mark off the 

 retinula from its surrounding pigment cells very sharply, and the 

 difference in the appearance of the protoplasm makes it impossible to 

 confuse the various cells. 



The portion of the retinula which lies between its thickest part and 

 the basement membrane is a strand of protoplasm circular in cross- 

 section and without any signs of differentiation. As the basement 

 membrane changes its position, by a process to be described later, 

 coming to lie near the optic ganglion, this portion of the retinula be- 

 comes longer, and the changes which take place in the retina consist 

 of the making over of this strand of protoplasm into the retinula cells 

 proper. This change progresses proximally and consists in the widen- 

 ing out of the cells with its accompanying rhabdome formation. The 

 nuclei shift as the retinula enlarges and elongates until we reach a con- 

 dition (fig. 2) in which two of them are at one level and the other six 

 (or seven) are at a lower level and arranged in a rosette. 



At the time when the nuclei are arranged in this manner, the most 

 distal portion of the retinula becomes arranged in a definite rosette, 

 caused by each of the cells forming a projection which shows its dis- 

 tinctness from the others in the group in cross-section. This arrange- 

 ment also progresses proximally until in the adult condition it is found 

 throughout the length of the retinula. At the same time the inner 

 portion of the mass becomes still more differentiated, and in the stage 

 just mentioned the axis of the distal end is occupied by a strand of 

 protoplasm which takes the iron hsematoxylin stain (the future rhab- 

 dome) surrounded by a clearer protoplasm. Outside of this clear area 

 the protoplasm is granular and pigment deposition takes place here, 

 keeping pace with the inner differentiations, and these changes also 

 progress toward the basement membrane. The rhabdome formation 

 precedes slightly the formation of the clear protoplasm around it, and 

 the proximal end of the forming rhabdome shades off gradually into 

 the surrounding undifferentiated cytoplasm. 



The nuclei gradually move inward as the cells assume their adult form 




144 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Fob., 



until they come to rest at about one-third of the distance from the 

 cone to the basement membrane, which on account of the tapering of 

 the retinula is at about the centre of the cell, as far as mass of cyto- 

 plasm is concerned. One of the nuclei, however, moves proximally 

 imtil it lies about half-way between the other nuclei and the basement 

 membrane. Where a nucleus is present, the retinula cell is slightly 

 pressed out, encroaching on the outer pigment cells, and the upper 

 nuclei are not all at the same level. The one nucleus which occupies 

 a more proximal level is separated by some distance from any of the 

 others, however, and, owing to the regularity with which it is found, 

 cannot be considered as due merely to a mechanical shifting. In the 

 older stages of development it becomes difficult to count the nuclei 

 of the retinula since they are at different levels, but I have been unable 

 to see anything which would lead me to suspect that this proximal nu- 

 cleus was other than one of the retinular nuclei. Neither is there any 

 indication that the presence of this nucleus is accountable for the pres- 

 ence of nine retinular cells in some ommatidia, for it is found in all 

 ommatidia and the nine-celled condition is comparatively rare. 



The rhabdome differentiation proceeds until it reaches the distal 

 surface of the basement membrane where it ends abruptly. In the 

 pupa stages I am unable to find the nerve fibres which in the adult eye 

 run parallel with the rhabdome and send fine fibrillse into it. It will 

 be noticed, however, that in the pupa the rhabdome is wider and not 

 so definite in outline as it is in the adult eye, and the nerve fibrils are 

 no doubt included in this darker central body which I have identified 

 as the rhabdome. Both rhabdome and nerve fibrilla? are but differen- 

 tiations of the cytoplasm of the retinula cells and their development 

 takes place together. The rhabdome is probably not a uniform struc- 

 ture, but no doubt contains a mass of fibrillse, the endings of the nerve 

 fibres. I am unable to see any such structures, however. 



The development of the retinula consists, then, in the changing of 

 the sense-bud-like spindle of the larval eye into a long column of cells 

 with a clear shaft through the centre, through which light can pass to 

 reach the nerve endings in it. From the previous description it will 

 be evident that the rhabdome is not formed b)^ processes from the cone 

 cells, which are present from the beginning of ommatidial development, 

 but is an intracellular differentiation of the retinula, there being a sharp 

 line of demarcation between the cone cells and rhabdome throughout 

 their development. 



b. The Cone Cells. — The cone cells are four in number, and in the 

 early pupa stage (fig. 3) the cone is spindle-shaped and lies directly 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 145 



distal to the retinular spindle. The nuclei are large and spherical, 

 and lie slightly distal to the centre of the cell. The cytoplasm is 

 granular, especiaUy in the distal portion of the spindle, and the cell 

 membranes are well marked. 



Very soon the cytoplasm begins to be differentiated, and by the time 

 the pupa has reached the stage figured (fig. 2) vacuoles begin to appear 

 in the proximal end of the spindle, which marks the beginning of the 

 formation of the clear cone substance. The cells now increase in size 

 considerably, and at the same time the number of small vacuoles 

 increases. Later these vacuoles unite, and finally a condition is reached 

 in which the proximal end of each cell is occupied by one large clear 

 vacuole. The cell boundaries remain distinct and a thin layer of 

 granular protoplasm remains smrounding the vacuole, so that it is 

 strictly an internal secretion and not to be interpreted as a secretion 

 poured out on the inner face of each of the cells. This process of differ- 

 entiation or intracellular secretion goes on until the nuclei, which 

 decrease in size and become long and narrow, are pushed to the distal 

 and lateral portion of the ceh, where they remain in the adult eye. 

 These nuclei are filled with fine chromatin granules. The cone in the 

 meantime becomes wide at the distal end, and elongates very much to 

 assume its true cone shape, and all that remains of the original cyto- 

 plasm is an extremely thin sheet all around the cone. I am inclined 

 to attribute the descriptions by some authors of nerve fibrils on the 

 cone to the shrinking of this thin film under certain fixatives. There 

 is no nervous connection with the cone, nor does it appear to have any 

 function save transmitting light rays to the sensitive retina. 



There is no indication of any prolongation of the cone proximally, 

 either to form the rhabdome, as previously described, or to form proto- 

 plasmic processes surrounding the rhabdome inside the retinula cells, 

 such as Patten describes for Vespa. Such fibres could not exist unless 

 they were to pierce the retinula cells, since the rhabdome is really a 

 part of the latter; and since the cell boundaries of the cone and retinula 

 are so well marked I feel sure that no such ingrowth occurs. 



Equally unsuccessful has been a search for any additions to the cone 

 at the distal end. In his work on the embryology of the eye of Vespa 

 Patten describes a layer of cells distal to the cone which arose by an 

 overfolding of the sides of the entire eye, and which gave rise to the 

 lens. In a later paper ( 1S90) he disposes of his invagination theory, but 

 describes a pouring out of chitin from the distal end of the cone, which 

 secretion he mistook for the layer of nuclei at an earlier time. ' From 

 my examination of Apis material I am unable to find anything which 

 10 




146 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Feb., 



could be mistaken for nuclei in that position (unless it be the corneal 

 pigment cells which are lateral to the distal end of the cone) or for 

 chitinous secretion of the cone; and for this insect eye, at any rate, I 

 am led to doubt the validity of his homology of such a structure with 

 the pseudocone of ommatidia of the "pseudocone type," since the 

 distal end of the cone is perfectly well defined at every stage observed. 

 The differentiation of the cone consists in a transformation of a cone 

 without any refractive secretion into one in which this secretion fills 

 all the cells proximal to the nuclei, or, in other words, a modification 

 of an acone condition into an eucone condition, to use terms introduced 

 by Grenacher for adult conditions of some eyes. There can be no 

 doubt that this was the course taken during the evolution of the eucone 

 ommatidium. Similarly, Hickson has shown that the so-called pseudo- 

 cones described for many insect eyes are but instances in which the 

 secretion has accumulated in the distal end of the cone rather than in 

 the proximal end. While the distinction drawn between these three 

 kinds of cones is justifiable, yet there seems nothing to oppose the view 

 that they are but modifications of one primitive type. The acone 

 ommatidia have no clear refractive substance differentiated in the cone 

 cells, and are considered as the primitive type of eye. The pseudocone 

 cones with the differentiation of clear cone 

 substance distal to the nuclei and the eucone 

 cones with a proximal secretion are but modifi- 

 cations of the primitive type. 



c. The Corneal Pigment Cells and the Lens. — 

 The lens is secreted by the two cells which 

 have been designated corneal pigment cells. 

 In the very earliest pupa stage these cells lie 

 distal and lateral to the cone cells, and since 

 they are thus placed at this time, and since 

 their secretion product is distal to the cone, 

 they are next in order in going out from the 

 axis of the typical ommatidium. 



Before these cells begin their secretion, how- 

 ever, the nuclei migrate down the sides of the 

 spindle-shaped cone and come to lie around 

 the apex of the cone. The cause of this mi- 

 gration is probably purely mechanical, viz., the 

 enlargement laterally and distally of the cone; 

 at the same time the nuclei are thus brought nearer to the source of 

 nutriment. As this shifting takes place the nuclei, originally ovoid. 



^(-^.-pc

become crescent-shaped, and finally almost encircle the apex of the 

 cone. Strands of cytoplasm connect the nucleated portion of the cell 

 with the distal portion, which remains at the point where secretion is 

 to take place. As the cone enlarges and the cell substance of the cor- 

 neal pigment cells is used up in the secretion of the lens, the portion 

 distal to the cone becomes reduced until in the adult eye it is almost 

 entirely absent. 



Almost immediately after pigment is first formed in the retinula cells, 

 it begins to be deposited in these corneal pigment cells. Owing to the 

 fact that the retinula pigment is at first small in quantity, and since 

 there is none in the outer pigment cells at this time, the pigment of 

 these distal pigmented cells, which is red, gives a pink color to the en- 

 tire eye in the early stages, rather than the brown or black color pos- 

 sessed by the other pigment, as is true in late stages. 



The granules of pigment are large and red in color, and when treated 

 with depigmenting mixtures do not disappear, but become somewhat 

 lighter in color. 



The lens is secreted by these cells in much the same way as is ordinary 

 chitin over the entire body of the bee. This chitinous covering is 

 deposited in layers which are easily visible in the adult lens. In 

 addition to these cells the outer pigment cells also seem to enter into 

 this. In the pupal eyes before any chitin is deposited by the corneal 

 pigment cells thin sheets of chitin extend out from the outer pigment 

 cells, and since these cells arc arranged at their distal ends in a nearly 

 hexagonal manner a cross-section of these plates shows the future 

 boundaries of the facets. In the adult eye the portion of the cornea 

 which directly overlies the outer pigment ceUs differs slightly from the 

 part directly over the cone in refractive index and in general appear- 

 ance, so that I think it probable that the space between these sheets of 

 chitin in the larva is filled by a secretion of the outer pigment cells. 

 If this be true, then every cell which enters into the formation of the 

 compound eye has to do with some sort of secretion, either intra- or 

 extracellular. 



The structure of the chitin laid down by the corneal pigment cells is 

 not uniform, the outermost layer being more dense than the rest, with 

 a decided tendency to take up an iron haematoxylin stain, the middle 

 or main portion being arranged in alternating layers of different den- 

 sit3% and the inner portion taking a protoplasmic stain, such as eosine 

 or Bordeaux red. 



From this description it will be seen that the corneal pigment cells 

 (Hauptpigmentzellen, pigment cells of the first order) are homologous 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



with the corneal hypodermal cells of the crustacean and aptorygote 

 insect eyes. In all crustacean compound eyes small nuclei arc de- 

 scribed as lying distal to the cone cell nuclei (or Sempcr's nuclei), and 

 these are the nuclei of the cells which secrete the lens. When the 

 ommatidia are arranged in facets, two such cells are present. In the 

 Apterygota, e.g., Lepisma saccharinum, Orchesdla, etc. (Hesse, 1901), 

 these two cells are present and occupy a similar position or ma}'- be 

 placed slightly more laterally. These two cells are characteristic of 

 these two types of compound eyes. On the other hand, the compound 

 eyes of most pterygote insects have the two pigment cells of the first 

 order (corneal pigment cells), and do not have the corneal hypodermal 

 cells, Hesse (1901) concluded that these two kinds of cells are homolo- 

 gous from an examination of adult eyes, and considered his point 

 strengthened by the fact that Johansen had described these pigment 

 cells as being distal to the cone cells at an early stage. Johansen did 

 not describe them as homologous, however, and derived the lens from 

 another source. From an examination of Apis I am convinced that 

 Hesse was correct in his deductions, for in this case the cells are not 

 only homologous, but the pigment cells here have identically the same 

 function as have the corneal hypodermal cells of the other eyes. 



As mentioned above, Johansen failed to see this homology and de- 

 scribes and figures the lens as being secreted by the cone cells. It has 

 been pointed out with sufficient detail that no such interpretation is 

 tenable for Apis at least, and we may well doubt its occurrence in 

 Vanessa. In PI. 23, fig. 11, he figures the secretion of the lens by the 

 cone cells and shows the corneal pigment cells extending to the distal 

 margin, and I am led to conclude that he has overlooked the position 

 of the pigment cell which remains distal to the cone. 



d. The Outer Pigment Cells. — These cells from the earliest larva to 

 adult stages extend the entire length of the ommatidium, and are what 

 are known as accessory cells in many eyes. They, like all the other 

 cells of the eye, are of ectodermic origin, there being no cells from 

 the mesoderm in the eye of Apis, such as are described in some eyes. 

 These cells are, normaUy, twelve in number, but when hair cells are 

 present between the ommatidia, which is very frequently the case, this 

 number is increased so that any definite enumeration is impossible; 

 and since these cells serve merely to fill the interornmatidial spaces 

 and to prevent reflection inside the lens, no more definite arrangement 

 is required. The nuclei of these cells lie proximal to the cone in pupal 

 stages, but in the lengthening of the cone they come to lie at about its 

 middle.

^ Pigment is deposited in these cells quite early, but not until after 

 it has appeared in both the retinular and corneal pigment cells, and is 

 most abundant at the two ends of the cell. It will be noticed that of 

 all the cells of the eye which contain pigment none acquire this until 

 they have begun to form the secretion to which they give rise. The 

 rhabdome is the first secretion formed, and pigment first appears in 

 the retinula; later the lens secretion appears, and then pigment appears 

 in the secreting cells, indicating, it seems to me, that this pigment is 

 of the nature of a by-product, although it is of itself of value. From 

 one point of view, pigment itself is a secretion, but the accumulation 

 of pigments often accompanies other secreting activities. Concerning 

 any possible movements of the pigment under different hght conditions, 

 no observations have been made. 



In the region where the basement membrane is formed these cells are 

 deeply pigmented, and the line of demarcation from the cell below is 

 very marked. At this point, also, and only here, the cells are fused 

 with the retinular elements. This intimate union can exist only when 

 the retinular elements have filled out to that point, since in the \mpa\ 

 stages tnat portion of the retinula is a thin strand. The retinular cells 

 here are also deeply pigmented. 



3. The Adult Ommatidium. 



In the discussion of the changes which take place during the pupal 

 period many of the details of the adult ommatidia 

 are given, and to avoid unnecessary repetition only 

 such things as have been omitted will be discussed 

 here. 



a. The Retinula.— The adult retinular cells are 

 extremely complicated structures, due to the fact 

 that each cell has so many differentiations inter- 

 nally. The central part of each cell is differentia- 

 ted into a sector of the rhabdome, which is possi- 

 bly a dead secretion, but of this there is room for 

 some doubt. Outside the rhabdome is an area of 

 clear protoplasm in which the nervous elements of 

 the cell are found, and still outside of this is the 

 granular portion of the cell in which pigment gran- 

 ules are found. Each of these cells then secretes 

 part of the rhabdome, acts as a pigment cell by 

 the accumulation of pigment on its outer surface, and is, in addition, a 

 nerve-ending cell.

150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



The innervation of the ommatidium is a question over which there 

 has been much discussion, and various views have been put forth. Tlie 

 views can, however, be classed into two groups: those which make the 

 cone cells the nerve-ending, and those which find the terminations in 

 the retinula. It has been shown conclusively by numerous investiga- 

 tors that the cone has nothing whatever to do with receiving light 

 stimuli, and it would be useless to take up the arguments against this 

 view, any more than has been done in showing that in the development 

 the cone and rhabdome are separate. 



Those who hold that the retinula is the nerve-ending of the omma- 

 tidium have not always been able to show in a satisfactory manner 

 just how this innervation takes place. On this point two views have 

 been held: (1) that the retinula is innervated by nerve fibrils from 

 the retinular ganglion which run into the retinular cells or rhabdome, or 

 (2) that the retinular cells are themselves ganglionic epidermal cells 

 which send in nerve fibres to the retinular ganglion. From the de- 

 scription which has preceded it is evident that the second of these 

 \dews is the one here held for the eye of the bee. Before going into a 

 detailed descripton of the nervous elements in the cells concerned, 

 let us first examine the problem. 



In the first place, it seems reasonable to assume that during the 

 coiu-se of the evolution of light-perceiving organs the first condition 

 was that in which certain cells of the hypodermis became sensitive to 

 light, or possibly heat, through the accumulation of pigment or some 

 other change in the cytoplasm. Such cells would arise before there 

 were any cells in the central nervous system to receive their nerve 

 stimuli, and it may be assumed without danger that such cells would 

 send in processes to the centrally placed nerve cells, when the time for 

 nerve connections arrived, rather than that the nerves arose from the 

 central nervous system. In other words, the peripheral nervous 

 system is older than the central nervous system which elaborates the 

 impulses, and on hypothetical grounds, a basis which is rather unsafe 

 in zoology unless backed up by observations, we may assume that the 

 innervation is centrad. 



From the standpoint of embryology, we find that the eye epidermis 

 is formed and even the ommatidia are differentiated before the retinal 

 ganglion cells have assumed their adult position or are connected with 

 the optic ganglia. Not only that, but the strands of cytoplasm which 

 become the nerves of the ommatidia arise from the retinula cells 

 and grow centrad. 



In the adult condition we find that the nerve filjrcs are continuous 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



with the cytoplasm of the retinula and run to the retinular gangUoii, 

 where they surround the nuclei of the ganghonic cells. There is no 

 indication of long nerve processes from the ganglion cells toward the 

 eye. 



The nervous elements of the retinular cell proper consist of a differ- 

 entiated portion of the cytoplasm inside the clear area which lies out- 

 side the rhabdome. This nerve fibre can be seen best in sections stained 

 in iron hamatoxylin, where it stains black. From this fibre, which 

 starts at the distal end of the cell and runs parallel to the rhabdome, 

 smaller fibrils are given off which run into the rhabdome where they all 

 end. More properly speaking, these fibrils are further differentiations 

 of cytoplasm which lies between the main fibril and the centre of the 

 retinula. These fibrils extend from the fibre to the rhabdome along 

 the whole length of the retinula proper, so that the nerve-endings are 

 very numerous. Below the basement membrane these main fibres can 

 be traced as dark lines in the centre of the protoplasmic processes to 

 the retinular ganglion. All of these fibres are best seen on cross- 

 sections where they stand out as black dots, but they can also be seen 

 on longitudinal sections. It is probable that the cause of the black 

 color of the rhabdome in sections stained with iron hsematoxylin is the 

 presence of these numerous nerve fibrils. Concerning the distribution 

 of these fibrils inside the rhabdome, I am unable to say anything defi- 

 nite, but they probably extend almost straight to the centre. In 

 material fixed in Kleinenberg's picro-sulphuric fixing fluid the rhab- 

 dome sometimes appears as a tube, and this may indicate that these 

 fibrils do not run all the way to the centre. While the innervation of 

 the ommatidium is under discussion, it might be stated that there is no 

 indication of nervous connection with any of the other cells peripheral 

 to the retinula. 



The significance of the single retinular nucleus which lies at a lower 

 level than the others of each ommatidium, is somewhat hard to explain. 

 Hickson held that some of the retinular cells of Musca had more than 

 one nucleus. In this form there are three layers of nuclei in place of 

 two, as in Ayis. Hesse, on the contrary, homologizes these lower 

 nuclei, only one of which is present in Apis, with the proximal retinular 

 cells of the apterygote insect eyes. In these forms the retinula is 

 divided into two parts, one distal to the other, each of which acts alone 

 in the formation of rhabdome structure, and both have nerve fibre 

 connections with the optic ganglia. A similar condition is found in 

 some pterygote insect ommatidia. Of these two views the one of 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Hesse seems more probable. As Hickson sa^^s, there is nothing mor- 

 phologically wrong with the supposition that certain cells are multi- 

 nucleate; but since the explanation of Hesse helps us to complete the 

 homologies of the cells of the ommatidia of the various groups, it 

 seems to have more weight. 



The question as to the method of modification in num.ber of retinular 

 cells during the course of evolution is an interesting one, but it must be 

 admitted that as yet very little is known concerning it. It seems not 

 unlikely that the ommatidium of the bee is changing cither from eight 

 to nine retinular cells, or from nine to eight, since it is rather rare for 

 the number of these elements to be variable. The thought has sug- 

 gested itself that possibly this one proximal nucleus was one which was 

 in the process of delamination from the ommatidial epidermis, and was 

 therefore tending toward a reduction of retinal elements, but this does 

 not seem to be as probable an explanation as that of Hesse. It may 

 be said, however, that Johansen describes the ommatidium of Vanessa 

 as having seven retinular cells and two retinal ganglion cells, while 

 in Apis there is probably but one retinal ganglion cell to each omma- 

 tidium and at least one more cell in each retinula. 



VH. — Homologies of Component Parts. 



The question of homologies of the various eyes of the invertebrates 

 has excited much discussion, but since only compound eyes have been 

 investigated in this paper, this problem will not be taken up here. 

 The question of the homology of the different kinds of compound eyes 

 is worthy of consideration. Such eyes occur in Crustacea and insects,* 

 and a comparison of the groups indicates that there is here either uni- 

 formity of origin and plan or one of the most remarkable cases of con- 

 vergence known in the animal kingdom. The essential part of the 

 ommatidium is the retinula, and this may be considered as a sense bud, 

 formed by the accumulation of cells sensitive to light, which has been 

 modified internally to aid in light perception. Since such groups of 

 cells occur throughout the whole animal kingdom and associated with 

 all the senses, there is nothing remarkable about the similarity so far. 

 In addition to the retinula, an ommatidium consists of a cone and a 



* No account of the so-called compound eyes of myriapods and arachnids is 

 taken here, since their plan is so different that they cannot readily be homologized 

 with those of crustaceans or insects. Until we know more of the comparative 

 embryology of these forms it may be as well to suspend judgment. I do not feel 

 qualified to include these in the present discussion, but evidently from the re- 

 searches of numerous investigators we may conclude that the homology is not as 

 close as in the forms under discussion.

chitinous covering which may be faceted, and possibly accessory cells 

 occur between ommatidia which act as pigment cells. In order that 

 the light rays may be centred on the retinular nerve fibres, some 

 refractive organ must be present above it (the cone) and the whole 

 organ must be covered by chitin, as is the rest of the body. This chitin 

 in turn may assist in the refraction, as it does in many cases, or may 

 even secondarily assume the functions of the cone entirely if no cone 

 substance is differentiated (aconc eyes). For the occurrence of these 

 parts there are but two explanations: either they are differentiations 

 of cells which formerly lay outside the retinula group, and have been 

 placed distal to it to assist in collecting light rays to form a more perfect 

 image, or they have been placed distal to the retinula by the differentia- 

 tion of some other cell layer which has been superimposed. 



The various cells of the ommatidium seem to lend themselves to 

 homologies very readily. The retinula of the various ommatidia are 

 groups of cells which are the nerve endings of the eye, and all ommatidia 

 agree in this respect. Retinula of apterygote insects, some Crustacea 

 and a few pterygote insects have two layers of retinular cells, while 

 others have but one, but, as was pointed out for Apis, the position of 

 nuclei at different levels in the higher insects may indicate a remnant 

 of a former two-layered condition for these retinulse also. In other 

 words, the morphological invagination by which the insect eye has 

 arisen may be carried farther in some cases than in others. Hickson 

 has shown that acone, pseudocone and eucone cones are probably 

 homologous, and the fact that some cones are composed of but two 

 cells while others have four seems a matter of small moment. The 

 probable homology of the corneal hypodermal cells of apterygote in- 

 sects and Crustacea with the corneal pigment cells of most pterygote 

 insects has been dwelt on sufficiently and is held on comparative ana- 

 tomical grounds by Hesse. The accessory pigment cells are undoubt- 

 edly but undifferentiated cells of the layer of epidermis from wliich the 

 retinulae arise, and their presence or absence is of small importance in 

 homologizing the different ommatidia. The fact also that mesodermal 

 cells may migrate to a position between ommatidia, as is held for some 

 eyes, is also of small consequence. As far, then, as the component parts 

 of the ommatidia are concerned there is no difficulty about establishing 

 a very close homology, and this similarity is considerably strengthened 

 by showing that the corneal pigment cells are not only similar in func- 

 tion to the corneal hypodermal cells, but that at an early stage they 

 actually occupy the same position. 



The whole question seems, then, to be one which must be settled 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Feb., 



from embryological evidence. The problem is, which of the two 

 methods of formation previously mentioned is the method which actu- 

 ally exists in ontogeny, and are all compound eyes formed by the same 

 method? From this work on Apis and that of Johansen on Vanessa it 

 is evident that the differentiation of cells outside the retinula to form 

 cone and lens layers is what occurs in insects, and the whole question 

 hinges on the development of the crustacean eye. Reichenbach and 

 Kingsley describe the eye as arising by an invagination; and if either 

 of these investigators is right, although they differ as to the fate of 

 the three layers formed, then the compound eyes of these crustacean.s 

 are not homologous with the compound eyes of iasects. On the other 

 hand, Herrick insists that the compound eye of Alpheus arises from a 

 single layer of epidermis, and according to this view the homology 

 holds. Herrick's view, that even if an invagination does occur it is 

 of no importance, does not seem tenable, for if an invagination occurs 

 then cone and retinula do not come from contiguous cells, and that I 

 beheve to be a matter of great importance. 



From the striking similarity in position and function of the parts 

 of the ommatidium, and from the observations of Herrick, we are safe 

 in concluding that the eyes of the various groups under consideration 

 are distinctly homologous, and there must be some other explanation 

 for the invaginations observed by the other writers mentioned. 



The interpretation of the formation of the ommatidium which is 

 held from an examination of the eye of Apis makes possible a very 

 close homology of the elements of the compound eye with the ocelli 

 of insects, such as was held by Grenadier; and this homology seems 

 materially strengthened since an homology can be shown between 

 the corneal pigment cells of insect ommatidia with the chitin-secreting 

 cells of the ocelli. An objection that might be raised is that the 

 vitreous body of the ocellus arises from cells which are all to one side of 

 the retina rather than from all sides, but since they are adjoining cells 

 this might be a secondary change. From sections of ocelli of the pupae 

 of the bee which have been examined, it is evident that the middle 

 ocellus arises from a double invagination, indicating a fusion of two 

 organs, while the lateral ocelli arise from single invaginations. 



VIII. — Summary. 



The primitive arrangement of ommatidia is tetragonal (p. 130). 

 The hairs over the lens are secreted by bi-nucleated hair cells with 

 intracellular ducts which lie between the ommatidia (p. 131). 



The ommatidium arises as a group of cells with superimposed nuclei, 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1.55 



which later become arranged as a spindle surrounded by smaller cells 

 (p. 136). 



This spindle is the retinula, and the cone cells and pigment cells 

 assume a distal position by a morphological invagination (p. 137). 



The retinula is the centre of the ommatidium, and the cone cells, 

 corneal pigment cells and outer pigment cells follow in the order 

 named (p. 141). 



The ommatidium is composed of eight or nine retinula cells around 

 the rhabdome, four cone cells, two corneal pigment cells and about 

 tv.-elve outer pigment cells (p. 126). 



The rhabdome and cone arc intracellular secretions, while the lens 

 is an extracellular secretion of the pigment cells (p. 144). 



The corneal pigment cells are homologous with the corneal hypoder- 

 mal cells of crustacean and apterygote insect ommatidia (p. 147). 



The innervation of the ommatidium is by a differentiation of part of 

 the retinular cells into nerve fibrils, and these extend to the retinular 

 ganglia (p. 149). 



The lens is secreted by the corneal pigment cells which early in the 

 pupa stage lie distal to the cone, and possibly also by the outer pigment 

 cells (p. 148). 



Pigment is formed inside all the cells of the ommatidium, except the 

 cone cells, by a cytoplasmic differentiation (p. 149). 



The ommatidium arises from a strictly one-layered epidermis, which 

 passes directly from the larva to the pupa without the loss of any cells 

 or additions from other tissues (p. 136).

CCELOSPORIDIUM BLATTELL^, A NEW SPOROZOAN PARASITE OF 

 BLATTELLA GERMANICA. 



(Preliminary Note.) 



BY HOWARD CRAWLEY. 



The Malpighian tubules of the so-called Croton bug, BlatteUa gcr- 

 manica L., are the habitat of a Sporozoan parasite which apparently 

 belor^s to the Haplosporidia. This group, which has the value of 

 an order, is divided into several rather poorly defined genera. The 

 animal herewith described does not fit very well into the present 

 scheme of classification, but for the sake of avoiding a needless multi- 

 plication of names, I shall accredit it to the genus Coslosporidium 

 -Mesnil and Marchoux. The creation of a new species is warranted, 

 whereupon, for the time being, the animal may be known as Ccelospo- 

 ridlum hlcUtellce sp. n. 



The life cycle, so far as I have yet been able to trace it, originates as 

 a minute cell of strongly acidophil cytoplasm, containing several 

 granules of chromatin. These granules, which range around one micron 

 in diameter, appear to have the value of nuclei, and they will be so 

 termed in the description which follows. 



At first the cell, or, to follow the terminology suggested by Minchin, 

 the trophozoite, is generally somewhat longer than broad, and lies with 

 its longer axis across the lumen of the tubule . The shape 

 may be as shown in either fig. 1 or 2. One end lies 

 against, and is apparently attached to, the lumen of the 

 tubule. I have not been able, however, to determine 

 the exact nature of this attachment. Neither in fixed 

 nor fresh preparations were there ever seen any processes 

 such as those of the epimerites of polycystid gregarines 

 Pj^ J or the inert pseudopodia of Ophryocystis. The attach- 



ment seems merely to be a close apposition, and there is 

 no objection to so regarding it. For in consideration of the narrow 

 lumina of the tubules and the lack of fluid currents passing through 

 them, the parasite is in little danger of being carried away. Certain 

 appearances, however, suggest that the maintainance of the usual 

 position is aided by the presence of an amorphous substance which lies 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 159 



between the parasite and the host cell. It is often impossible, in the 

 case of those small closely applied forms, to get a sharp line of demarka- 

 tion between the sporozoan and the epithelium, the one blending with 

 the other by imperceptible degrees. 



However this may be, the juxtaposition of the parasite and the cell 

 is evidently of no great importance to the former. Ordinarily the 

 smaller, undeveloped stages are attached and the later stages free. 

 The reverse may, however, be observed and the matter is evidently one 

 largely of chance. 



By a uniform growth in all directions the trophozoite becomes 

 an egg or potato-shaped organism, reaching a length of around 20 

 microns. ^This, however, is to be noticed only in the free individuals 

 and where the spatial relations are favorable. More usually the 

 lumina of the tubules are so small and so closely crowded with the 

 parasites that the latter are constrained to assume a vermiform or 

 plate-like shape. Thus fig. 2, which is the longitudinal section of 

 an indivdiual with a circular cross-section, would 

 answer equally well for the cross-section of an 

 individual extending for some distance along the 

 tubule cells. 



Both these elongated or flattened individuals, 

 as well as the egg-shaped forms mentioned above, 

 may still retain the primitive character of being 

 naked masses of uniform cytoplasm with a vari- 

 ous number of solid nuclei. Generally, however, 

 the reproductive cycle is inaugurated while the 

 organism is still very small. The first indica- jrjg 2. 



tions of this are furnished by the nuclei. 

 These lose their spherical form and their solidity. They may become 

 either somewhat irregular masses or else rings. The elements are so 

 minute that the determination is difficult, but from what takes place 

 later these early phenomena are apparently the expression of the 

 l^reaking up of the nucleus into extremely small chromosomes. 



Simultaneously there arises around each nucleus a vacuole, which, 

 in its turn, can often be seen to be surrounded by a condensed belt of 

 cytoplasm. These are the first steps in the breaking up of the tropho- 

 zoite into separate elements, and from this point on development may 

 progress along either one of two lines. In the one case the .result is 

 the production of what I shall call the "round bodies." In the other 

 the process is clearly spore-formation. I have not yet succeeded in 

 satisfactorily differentiating these two developmental courses in their 




160 



TROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



[Feb., 



Fig. 3. 



earlier stages, and the detailed account will be reserved for my final 

 communication. I shall here merely consider the latest stages in each 

 case. 



Fig. 2 shows an acidophil cell still attached to the epithelium. 

 Within it are several clear areas. Each of these is occupied by a 

 quantity of chromatin. In several cases the manner in which this 

 chromatin is arranged is strongly indicative of mitotic division. In 

 fig. 3 is shown what may be called a cyst of the round bodies. The 



original trophozoite con- 

 sists of a shell, divided 

 into irregularly shaped 

 compartments. Each 

 compartment contains a 

 completed round body. 

 The round body is nor- 

 mally spherical ; occasion- 

 ally ellipsoidal. It usu- 

 ally consists of a solid 

 mass of strongly acidophil 

 cytoplasm containing an irregular nucleus. That the element shown 

 in fig. 3 is derived from that of fig. 2 is indicated by the striking resem- 

 blance between the nuclei, and by their size. In the stage of fig. 2 the 

 nuclei are in division, and are thus, as is usual, lying within clear 

 regions. To obtain the conditions shown in fig. 3 it is only necessary 

 to conceive the collection of the cytoplasm around the nuclei, with the 

 consequent disappearance of the vacuoles. 



A little later, by the complete disintegration of the cyst, the round 

 bodies come to lie free in the lumina of the tubules. They are minute 

 elements, ranging in diameter from H-2 microns. There is probably a 

 very delicate ectosarc or membrane, since at times the cytoplasm Is 

 wanting, the chromatin lying within an otherwise empty shell. The 

 ultimate destiny of these bodies has not yet been discovered. 



The formation of the spores follows much the same general lines, but 

 differs considerably in detail. The nuclei, after passing through the 

 stage of individual chromosomes, concentrate into rings, ovals, or the 

 so-called dumbbell shape (figs. 4 and 5). Frequently they may be- 

 come wholly solid masses of chromatin, but more usually they show a 

 central cavity, or, in the case of those having the dumbbell shape, two 

 such cavities. Around this cliromatin mass there is nearly always a 

 clear space, while the bulk of the spore consists of a thick shell of acido- 

 phil cytoplasm (fig. 5). Occasionally the clear space encroaches upon 




1905.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 



161 



the cytoplasmic mass, which may thus become a thin shell, or even 

 wholly wanting at the two ends of the spore. There is an evident 



Fig. 5. 



membrane or shell in the mature spore, the average length of which is 

 5 microns. 



The reason for regarding these bodies as spores is the fact that they 

 occur in the alimentary canal of the host, both before and behind the 

 openings of the Malpighian tubules. 

 In the former position they were 

 seen to lie close against the epithe- 

 lial cells, but none of my material 

 showed any of them en route to en- 

 trance. 



Perhaps the most striking phe- 

 nomenon exhibited by this parasite 

 is the abundance wdth which it 

 occurs. Fig. 6 shows the cross-sec- 

 tion of a tubule, wherein the para- 

 sites come near to occluding the 

 entire lumen. This is a quite char- 

 acteristic condition. It would seem 



that so complete a blocking up of the tubule should produce dis- 

 turbances in the economy of the host. Yet the tubule epithelium 

 was throughout, to all appearances, wholly normal.

THE SPERMATOGENESIS OF SYRBULA AND LYCOSA, WITH GENERAL CON- 

 SIDERATIONS UPON CHROMOSOME REDUCTION AND 

 THE HETEROCHROMOSOMES. 



BY THOMAS H. MONTGOMERY, JR. 



The present paper presents observations on the spermatogenesis of 

 Syrhula (a grasshopper) and of Lycosa (a spider), together with- some 

 broader conclusions in regard to questions of the behavior of the 

 chromosomes during the maturation mitoses, and of the nature of those 

 modified nuclear elements which have been termed by me heterochro- 

 mosomes. 



The subject of heredity, which in its broadest sense includes most 

 of the problems of the phenomena of life, is being pursued from two 

 main lines: from that of the study of the germ cells, and from that of 

 an analysis of the results of cross breeding. The actual steps of the 

 process of heredity, if we shall ever understand them, will be learned 

 by the first method, by the investigation of the energies of those cells 

 which transmit ancestral traits. The second method is of less import- 

 ance than the first, for while it may permit an analysis of the propor- 

 tional transmission of different ancestral traits, it can in no way eluci- 

 date the steps of this process, for the very reason that its material 

 basis is the terminal stage alone, and the somatic condition at that. 



And of all cellular investigations, those that concern themselves 

 with the nuclear chromosomes seem to penetrate deepest into the mys- 

 teries of the problem, for these cellular components more than all others 

 seem proven to be the centres of hereditary energies; can we unlock 

 their secrets we will have opened the door to the light, for there seems 

 to be no other portal. 



The study of the chromosomes has ceased to be regarded as 

 an academic question, or as a mere side issue of problems of cell 

 division, and is slowly but surely coming into the centre of the field 

 of biological thought — of that thought which embraces the broader 

 community of natural phenomena and docs not lose sight of the forest 

 for the trees. All things are in the nature of processes, to the biologist 

 of genetic processes, and of the \dtal changes heredity is the one that is 

 the most comprehensive; broadly speaking, biology is the study of 

 heredity. There arc two methods used in the search for the solution, 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



the morphological and the experimental. The former reasons out the 

 process as it is to be understood from the sequence in structural 

 change ; the latter aims directly at an analysis of the process by a study 

 of result where the cause is measurable. Yet just here it must be held 

 in mind that the true morphologLst has in ultimate consideration the 

 explanation of process, so that he is fully as much a physiologist as 

 the other. And his method is correct, because structure only is visible 

 while process is an intangible change, and therefore he is reasoning 

 from the perceptible to the imperceptible. Many morphologists do 

 not conceive this mental attitude rightly, and most physiologists are 

 inclined to hold that all morphologists see no further than the struc- 

 ture. Yet the morphological basis must precede the physiological 

 experiment, and it is quite questionable whether both will not always 

 be necessary as complemental methods ; we cannot say which w^ll ulti- 

 mately prove the more important, but all will admit that the greater 

 interpretations of biology have had a morphological basis, and that the 

 morphologist has done his full half in reasoning out the processes. 



That is not scientific morphology which goes no further than the 

 structural fact; but with minor exceptions all morphologists try to 

 go much further than this, and throughout their analyses have in 

 mind the process. And the morphologist is an analyst of natural phe- 

 nomena, an explainer of those normal experiments not performed with- 

 in the laboratory. Therefore a present tendency to maintain that only 

 experiment can furnish explanations, and that structural study can 

 present only observational results, has no foundation whatsoever. 

 The true method is to remember always that in the living as in the non- 

 living world the process must be interpreted ; so long as this is not for- 

 gotten it matters little what mould the investigation is cast in. 



Some years of rather intensive study of the structure of the germ 

 cells, particularly of the behavior of their, chromosomes, has led me to 

 the conclusion that there is simplicity and essential uniformity among 

 the bewildering maze of the observable. When we strive to explain 

 the more complex from the more simple we discover this uniformity, 

 but not when we stubbornly persist in regarding the more complex as 

 the condition that can be immediately explained. Complete agreement 

 of opinion there may never be, but this is because of mental differences 

 and not of lack of uniformity in the natural processes. A main reason 

 for the failure to interpret the uniformity has come from one of 

 three preconceptions : of persistent study of an object which has shown 

 itself incapable of furnishing a clear solution; consequently of the 

 neglect of seeking comparative evidence ; and of loyalty to the views 




164 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



of the first workers in the field, or fear of conflict with them. In com- 

 mon law a man is held innocent until he is proven guilty, but in scien- 

 tific thought we should consider a view erroneous until it is proven 

 to be correct to fact. That view which presents phenomena from the 

 simplest interpretation, which is based upon the broadest comparative 

 series of facts, and, above all. which admits of no exceptions in natural 

 sequence, is the one which in the end has the greatest probability of 

 maintaining itself, because the one most likely to be congruous with the 

 facts. 



1. — Spermatogenesis of Syrbula acuticornis Bruner. 



Testes of adults of this Acridid were collected at Austin, Texas, 

 in the middle of October, fixed in Flemrm'ng's stronger fluid, and 

 stained with iron hsematoxyline. For the identification of the species 

 I am indebted to Mr. James A. G. Rehn, of the Academj^ of Natural 

 Sciences, Philadelphia. A considerable number of testes were sectioned 

 and studied, whence it resulted that some of them contained ten bi- 

 valent chromosomes in the first spermatocytes, others twelve. I can- 

 not determine whether this is due to Syrbula acuticornis being a form 

 including more than one species, or whether it is a single species with 

 individual variation in the number of the chromosomes; the latter 

 alternative would be in contradiction to the condition maintaining in 

 most species. Because this point could not be explained, and because 

 good proof is necessary to establish the occurrence of indi^adual varia- 

 tion in the number of chromosomes, the following description is limited 

 to cells contained in the testes of one individual. 



Work has been done previously upon the spermatogenesis of Acri- 

 didse by Wilcox (1895), McClung (1900) and Sutton (1900, 1902). My 

 results are in essential agreement with those of McClung, except with 

 regard to the time of the reduction division. Carnoy (1885) was the 

 first to describe cell divisions of male germ cells in Acrididse, and figured 

 in detail spermatogonial mitoses. 



As in the Hemiptera each testis is composed of long tubular follicles, 

 but they are more numerous in number, the earlier stages of the sperm 

 cells placed at the proximal end of the follicle, and the later stages at 

 successively following regions of the follicle. As far as I have noticed 

 there is no difference between the cells of different follicles, beyond a 

 dimensional one. 



Two generations of spermatogonia are found in the mature testis, 

 the smaller of which is the last generation, and by division forms the 

 first spermatocytes. The intermediate body or cell-plate (Zivischen- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



Jcorper of the German writers) persists for a long while after the division 

 of the penultimate generation of spermatogonia, even up to the pro- 

 phases of the last spermatogonic mitosis. Accordingly the rest stage 

 of the last generation of spermatogonia (Plate IX, fig. 1) shows a dis- 

 tinct polarity of the cell-body, with a distal pole at which is the persisting 

 cell-plate, and a dark mass of idiozome substance, which appears to be 

 in part, at least, derived from the connective fibrils of the preceding 

 mitosis; and an opposite or central pole containing the nucleus. The 

 nucleus shows minute chromatin globules distributed in bead-like 

 chains along the linin fibrils, and also accumulated in larger masses. 

 With great regularity there is found also in each nucleus two or three 

 larger, somewhat irregular, deep-staining bodies ; whether they are 

 nucleoli or heterochromosomes cOuld not be decided by the use of the 

 iron hsematoxyline stain. 



The prophases of the last and penultimate spermatogonic mitoses 

 appear similar in character. The chromatin seems to arrange itself 

 into a continuous spirem, or, if not into one thread, certainly into but 

 a small number of very long threads. Plate IX, figs. 2-6 illustrate a 

 succession of the later prophases, and all show stages of segmentation of 

 the spirem. Fig. 2 shows a pair of minute centrosomes just external to 

 the idiozome body, and figs. 3 and 5 successive stages of the central 

 spindle ; the nuclear membrane commences to dissolve first in the vicin- 

 ity of the central spindle. The only point deserving particular comment 

 in the stages is a chromatin element, marked A". 2 in the figures, that is 

 found in every cell ; it is a portion of the chromatin spirem of smaller 

 diameter than the other segments, much more convoluted and in such a 

 manner as to represent a small corkscrew, and frequently appearing to 

 be enclosed within its peculiar membrane. It resembles in this respect 

 the accessory chromosome described by Sutton (1900) for the sper- 

 matogonia of Brachystola. It is an element that appears to be retarded 

 in its stages on comparison with the others— not condensing nor seg- 

 menting as rapidly as they do. When the nuclear membrane has com- 

 pletely dissolved away this single loop segments into two, which are 

 still to be distinguished from other chromosomes of the same length by 

 narrower diameter and more spiral form. These two chromosomes 

 resulting from the division of the single convoluted element are prob- 

 ably the heterochromosomes which become much better demonstrable 

 in the spermatocytes ; for the heterochromosomes of the spermatocytes 

 differ from the other chromosomes in their behavior, as will be shown, 

 and this pair in the spermatogonia behave at first differently from the 

 others. Because these heterochromosomes are demonstrable in such 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



early spermatogonic prophases, we can conclude that they must be 

 present in the rest stage of the nucleus, though merely in the form of 

 constituents of the chromatin reticulum. And their juxtaposition in 

 the chromatin spirem is a point in evidence of an earher contention of 

 mine (1900, 1904a), that in the chromatin spirem of spermatogonia 

 homologous chromosomes, i.e., such as unite into pairs during the con- 

 sequent synapsis stage, lie next each other. All the chromosomes 

 become longitudinally split during the prophases. 



Two clear pole views were found of the spermatogonic monaster 

 stage (metaphase) , Plate IX, figs. 7 and 8. Each showed exactly twenty 

 chromosomes. These occur in pairs, and we can distinguish three largest 

 pairs {A, a; B, b; C, c) and three smallest (in succession from the 

 largest to the smallest, F, f; D. d; E, e). The exact similarity in form 

 and size of the members of a pair does not evince itself so clearly in a 

 camera drawing as in the study of the chromosomes themselves, be- 

 cause the members of a pair usually do not lie exactly in the same plane. 

 So twelve of the twenty chromosomes can be demonstrated to form six 

 pairs ; the remaining eight chromosomes are so nearly of the same size 

 and form that their arrangement into pairs cannot be shown, but by 

 analogy with the others it is probable they constitute a series of four 

 pairs. One pair of the latter four probably corresponds to the pair 

 of heterochromosomes found in the prophases, but their earlier peculi- 

 arity of convoluted shape no longer persists, so they offer no means for 

 recognition. The spermatogonia, accordingly, contain each two hetero- 

 chromosomes and eighteen ordinary chromosomes. 



All these chromatin elements were longitudinally split, and became so 

 placed upon the spindle (Plate IX, fig. 9) that the daughter chromosomes 

 separate along the line of this split; fig. 10 shows an early anaphase. 

 Fig. 11 is a pole view of one of the two first spermatocytes resulting 

 from this division, and shows exactly twenty chromosomes. There- 

 fore the first spermatocyte receives a half of each of the two hetero- 

 chromosomes and of each of the eighteen ordinary chromosomes. In 

 each first spermatocyte, daughter cell of the last spermatogonic division, 

 the nucleus commences to reconstitute itself (fig. 12), The nuclear 

 membrane reasserts itself, the chromosomes commence to elongate 

 and take on more irregular contours ; but an interesting phenomenon is 

 that two of the chromosomes {n. 2, fig. 13) do not undergo these 

 changes, but remain smooth and dense; these are heterochromosomes, 

 and in all probability identical with those in the spermatogonia. At a 

 later stage (fig. 14) these unite to form a single bivalent heterochromo- 

 some (n. 2), and they retain this condition up to the time of the first 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



maturation mitosis. The other chromosomes have become long and 

 thread-hke, and an irregular nucleolus (A''.) has appeared. Following the 

 stages of figs. 14 and 15 is reached a complete rest stage (fig. 16), with 

 the chromatin globules finely distributed along the linin threads — the 

 nucleus very similar in appearance to that of spermatogonia in the 

 rest stage, except for the presence of the large heterochromosome. A 

 rest stage preceding the synapsis I have never before found in any 

 object, but it has been described for Ascaris and certain other* forms. 

 The heterochromosome is still nearly straight, and when viewed from 

 the proper angle shows not only a transverse constriction, marking the 

 point of junction of the two univalent ones, but also a longitudinal 

 split in each of the latter (figs. 15, 16). In later stages of the spermato- 

 cyte these characteristics of the heterochromosome cannot be distin- 

 guished, and from a study of the later stages alone one might easily be 

 misled to the conclusion that the heterochromosome of the spermato- 

 cyte were a univalent element. 



Next the chromatin reticulum segregates into short loops, very much 

 convoluted and occasionally simulating longitudinal splittings (Plate 

 IX, figs. 17, 18). But a long study of cells in this period shows that the 

 space between two mutually wound loops is not a longitudinal split, 

 and that the latter, i.e., a splitting into two of each chromatin globule, 

 along the length of a loop, rarely ever commences so early. On the con- 

 trary the double loops represent pairs of univalent and correspondent 

 (homologous) chromosomes, so that this stage is the commencement of 

 the conjugation into pairs of the eighteen ordinary chromosomes; this 

 becomes the more obvious on comparison with subsequent conditions. 

 Now, also, the heterochromosome commences to bend at an angle at 

 its middle point, on its path from the earlier straight form to its later 

 one of a nearly closed V. 



This leads, the chromosomes becoming much longer (Plate IX, fig. 

 19), to the synapsis stage (figs. 20-22) ; throughout this stage the nuclear 

 membrane is almost or quite imperceptible, and the chromatin loops in 

 the form of irregular U's and V's, crowded most densely at that nuclear 

 pole (the distal) next the greatest amount of cytoplasm. In all the 

 drawings only a few of these loops are shown, mainly those seen dis- 

 tinctly for their entire length. Their relative lengths differ greatly in 

 size, as is to be seen particularly in fig. 21 . Each such loop is a bivalent 

 chromosome, for they are nine in number, corresponding to the nine 

 pairs of ordinary chromosomes of the spermatogonia, and therefore 

 each arm of one is a univalent chromosome. Two univalent chromo- 

 somes are usually united only by one end, that marked x in fig. 21 ; but 




168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



sometimes the opposite ends also are joined, elongated rings resulting 

 instead of other forms. The space between the two arms of such a 

 bivalent chromosome does not represent a longitudinal split, but the 

 area between two entire bivalent chromosomes. The true longitudinal 

 split becomes apparent as a cleavage of the small chromatin masses 

 forming each univalent chromosome, and is a line of chromatin sepa- 

 ration within each univalent chromosome; sometimes it cannot be 

 seen, which is due to the chromosome being viewed from the edge. 

 This is the first and only longitudinal split of the chromosomes from the 

 time of first formation of the spermatocytes up to the stage of the 

 spermatid. No trace of a longitudinal split can longer be seen in the 

 heterochromosome, which now has in most cases the form of two nearly 

 parallel rods, produced by the bending at the middle of the original 

 straight one. This synapsis stage corresponds to the similarly named 

 stage of the Hemiptera in the close massing of the chromosomes near 

 one pole of the nucleus, but we have seen that the conjugation of the 

 chromosomes becomes affected at an earlier period, that of the figs. 17 

 and 18. There is evidence that in Syrbula, as I have shown to be the 

 case in Peripatus, there is a continuous linin spirem during the synapsis 

 stage ; but at no period of the first spermatocyte is there a continuous 

 ^chromatin spirem. The splitting of the chromatin globules does not 

 occur simultaneously for all composing a chromosome, but rather suc- 

 cessively; and each globule or granule is a mass of demonstrable 

 smaller microsomes. Hence there is no proof that each smallest visible 

 microsome divides into two during the longitudinal splitting of a 

 chromosome. 



Then comes a post-synapsis stage in which the chromosomes are no 

 longer densely grouped, and when the longitudinal split is very clear. 

 In figs. 23 and 24, illustrating this stage, only three and four respectively 

 of the nine bivalent chromosomes are drawn ; and the point x on each 

 marks the linin band connecting every two univalent chromosomes. 

 Very rarely does the longitudinal split become wider than shown in 

 these figures, but sometimes it wddens as much as is shown in the largest 

 chromosome of fig. 25. This was the maximum extent of separation 

 seen of the halves of a split univalent chromosome, and from this stage 

 through the following this split narrows gradually. 



Unlike most of the Hemiptera no rest stage follows, but the sperma- 

 tocytes enter immediately upon the prophases of the first maturation 

 mitosis; successive steps of this process are shown in figs. 27-31. The 

 nucleus enlarges, the chromosomes lie close to its wall, the delicate 

 linin fibres change their character and break each into a row of minute

globules, as roughly indicated in fig. 29; this last phenomenon I have 

 found to be of general occurrence in spermatocytes, but it has been 

 investigated most in ovocytes. The chromosomes through these stages 

 shorten and condense, some into bent or straight rods, others into more 

 or less closed rings; the surface of the chromosomes remains rough 

 and somewhat filamentous until the nuclear membrane disappears 

 (compare fig. 30 with fig. 31). The longitudinal split of the chromo- 

 somes gradually narrows, as one sees in the series of figures 23-25 and 

 27-30; it does not widen out, so that the relations of tlie univalent 

 components of a bivalent chromosome remain approximately the same 

 as in preceding stages. The early bivalent U or V of the synapsis 

 period may become a straight dumbbell, or its univalent arms may be- 

 come apposed along their length, or it may become a ring; but in all 

 cases the position of the longitudinal split is along the length of each 

 univalent chromosome, whether that be straight or bent (figs. 27, 28, 

 30). Very rarely have the chromosomes an X-shape (fig. 31). There- 

 fore each bivalent chromosome is composed of two univalent chromo- 

 somes joined by one end or by both ends (in the case of rings), and the 

 space enclosed by a ring is not a longitudinal split but the area sepa- 

 rating two entire univalent chromosomes. Wliere the two univalent 

 chromosomes of a pair are connected is in most cases marked by a 

 constriction (x, figs. 27, 29), and in the rings there may be two such 

 constrictions (the larger ring of fig. 29) in accordance with the con- 

 junction in these cases of both ends. These chromosomes are thus 

 essentially, in formation and shape, like those of the Hemiptera and 

 Peripatus: each represents two longitudinally split univalent chro- 

 mosomes joined by one or both ends. And the gradual narrowing or 

 closure of the longitudinal split is as evident and undeniable as in any 

 other object studied by me. 



Through these prophases the heterochromosome is recognizable by 

 its smooth contour and compact structure (Plate IX, n. 2, figs. 27-30). 

 It is now almost always in the form of a rod so bent that both arms lie 

 contiguous and parallel, as shown in fig. 26 where the arm seen on high 

 focus is stippled and that seen on deeper focus drawn in outline only. 

 Each of its arms, as we have seen, represents a univalent heterochr^ - 

 mosome. 



With the disappearance of the nuclear membrane, which commences 

 to dissolve^ away first at the poles near the centrosomes (Plate IX, fig. 

 31), the chromosomes have attained their completed dense structure 

 and smooth outline and take their position within the equatorial plate 

 (figs. 32-34) . There are exactly ten bivalent chromosomes present, one- 




170 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



half the miml)er of univalent chromosomes present in the spermatogo- 

 nia, namely, one bivalent heterochromosome and nine bivalent ordinary 

 chromosomes. But at this stage there seems not to be possible a posi- 

 tive recognition of which is the heterochromosome. In a number of 

 cases after nine of the chromosomes were arranged in the equator and 

 some of them were beginning to divide (fig. 33), one (y) had not yet 

 taken up that position but lay nearer one spindle pole than the other. 

 This was the case, e.g., with four cells in exactly the same stage lying 

 in the same section of one testicular follicle, and in all of these the iso- 

 lated chromosome was of the same size and form, straight, and appear- 

 ing to consist of two closely apposed arms. It may be that this chromo- 

 some is the heterochromosome with which it agrees in general form and 

 size, but this could not be definitely determined ; ultimately it takes a 

 position in the equator and divides with the others. In fig. 32 is an 

 element, y, closely corresponding in size with it and with the hetero- 

 chromosome during the prophases; but I cannot say positively that 

 y of fig. 32 is the heterochromosome, though the probability of it is 

 evident. All these chromosomes become so placed in the spindle that 

 mantle fibres from one spindle pole are attached to one univalent ele- 

 ment, and mantle fibres from the other spindle pole to the other uni- 

 valent component of each bivalent chromosome. The longitudinal 

 split can no longer be seen, but previously it lay in the axis of each 

 univalent chromosome. These definitive chromosomes may be dumb- 

 bell-shaped, or as frequently irregularly V-shaped, ring-shaped, or in 

 the form of twQ parallel rods (Plate IX, figs. 31-33; Plate X, fig. 34). 

 But whatever the form, they become arranged so in the spindle that 

 the point or points of junction of the univalent components of each 

 lies in the equatorial plane. The early formation of these chromosomes, 

 their arrangement in the spindle, then their division (Plate X, figs. 34- 

 36) show that the first maturation mitosis is a reduction division and 

 separates from each other the univalent chromosomes of each pair. 

 There is no evidence that this is an equation division taking place 

 along the line of the longitudinal split — no evidence at any period 

 that a chromosome had become elongated in a line at right angles to 

 its original long axis. Each arm of a bivalent chromosome is a whole 

 univalent chromosome and not a split half of one ; and the long axis 

 of each arm is in the same line as its long axis at earlier stages. I 

 have tested the morphological evidence of this process very honestly 

 and fairly, for at the commencement of my study I was quite prepared 

 to find the first maturation mitosis an equation division. But it is a 

 reduction division. The di\dsion of certain of the chromosomes may 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



call for some fm-ther explanation. Next to the straight or slightly 

 bent dumbbell-shaped bivalent chromosomes the most frequent form 

 is that of an irregular V, such as those lettered K in Plate IX, figs. 

 32 and 33; in each of these figm'cs one univalent half of each such 

 chromosome is shown black and the other white; p of fig. 32 is such 

 a chromosome seen at right angles to the other views. K of Plate X, 

 fig. 34 shows the separation of the components of such a chromosome. 

 The division of one of the forms of y of Plate IX, fig. 32 is shown bj^ y 

 in Plate X, fig. 34. The division of the dumbbell-shaped chromosomes 

 is clear from the figures. Whereas ring-shaped chromosomes are fre- 

 quent in the preceding late prophases, they are only very exception- 

 ally found in the equatorial plate, so that probably by the pull of 

 the mantle fibres upon them these rings change into the form of the 

 chromosomes lettered K. 



In the anaphase of this reduction division as homologous univalent 

 chromosomes move apart from each other, each opens up in the form 

 of a V (Plate X, figs. 35-37). This opening is the reappearance of the 

 longitudinal split, since it is a cleft along the long axis of each univalent 

 chromosome. In no way can it be considered a transverse split, a space 

 between two whole univalent chromosomes. This split is widest and 

 appears first at the end of the chromosome turned toward the equa- 

 torial plane, and rarely extends quite through the opposite end. Verti- 

 cal (fig. 38) and obliquely lateral (fig. 37) views of a daughter plate of 

 chromosomes, i.e., of the chromosome plate of a second spermatocyte, 

 show without exception ten elements, the same as the number in the 

 first spermatocytes; accordingly all the chromosomes divide in the 

 reduction mitosis. But each of the ten elements of the second sper- 

 matocyte is univalent instead of bivalent, and its cleft or constriction 

 marks the longitudinal split. Witnout any indication of a rest stage 

 the centrosomes of each second spermatocyte wander apart from each 

 other, and each through an angle of 90°, so that the axis of the second 

 maturation spindle comes to lie at right angles to that of the first (fig. 

 39). In the equator of this spindle each of the ten chromosomes be- 

 comes so placed that the fine of its longitudinal split coincides with the 

 equatorial plane. In the ensuing anaphase occurs, then, an equatorial 

 division, separation from each other of longitudinal halves of univalent 

 chromosomes. All ten chromosomes divide, and a pole view of one of 

 the resulting daughter cells (spermatids) shows also ten chromosomes 

 (fig. 40), exactly half the number found in the spermatogom'mn; no 

 exceptions were observed to this numerical relation. 



Exactly how the bivalent heterochromosome comports itself in the 




172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb-. 



maturation mitoses could not be definitely settled, since it could not be 

 satisfactorily distinguished from other chromosomes of about the same 

 size. But there is some probability, as was pointed out, that it may be 

 the chromosome marked y in Plate IX, figs. 32 and 33; and in very 

 early stages of the spermatocytes (figs. 15, 16) it showed a longitudinal 

 splitting which soon after seemed to disappear. For these reasons of its 

 proved bivalence and its longitudinal splitting, in conjunction with 

 the fact that each chromosome divides in each maturation mitosis, it 

 becomes most probable that it undergoes a reduction division in the 

 first mitosis, and an equation division in the second. For since it is 

 formed and has essentially the same constitution as the other chromo- 

 somes, there would be all reason to expect it to divide like them ; and 

 a more trenchant reason is this, that of the ten chromosomes of a second 

 spermatocyte there is no particular one which from any peculiarity of 

 structure could be regarded as bivalent. This is, of course, only cir- 

 cumstantial evidence of its undergoing first a reductional and then an 

 equation division, but the probability of this contention is obvious; 

 there is no doubt that it undergoes two divisions. 



In the monaster stage of the spermatogonia (Plate IX, figs. 7, 8) cer- 

 tain chromosome pairs could be rccogm'zed bj'' peculiarities in form and 

 size, namely, those lettered in these figures. It is corroborative evidence 

 of the persistence of the individuality of the chromosomes, if, indeed, any 

 further proof of this idea is needed to-day, that the same differences 

 are observable in later stages. So among the ten univalent chromo- 

 somes of a second spermatocyte (Plate X, figs. 37, 38) are found three 

 notably larger than the rest and three markedly smaller. So in the 

 figures one marked F (/) would correspond either to F or f in Plate 

 IX, figs. 7, 8; A (a) to either A or a of figs. 7 and 8; and so on for the 

 others. And even in the spermatid (Plate X, fig. 40) there are the 

 same size relations; the ten pairs of chromosomes of a spermatogo- 

 nium could be obtained by putting together the ten chromosomes 

 from each of two second spermatocytes derived from the same first 

 spermatocyte ; but the ten single chromosomes of a second sperma- 

 tocyte could be reestablished only by bringing together the ten semi- 

 valent chromosomes from each of the two spermatids resulting from 

 such a spermatocyte. The first maturation mitosis separates from 

 each other the two univalent chromosomes that compose a pair of dis- 

 associated ones in the spermatogonium, and a conjugated pair in the 

 first spermatocyte. 



Finally, a word as to the behavior of certain cellular structures other 

 than chromosomes — only a brief statement, for the present results are 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



corroborative of my (1900) earlier ones upon Peripatus. In the 

 achromatic spindle a central spindle, fibres continued from pole to pole, 

 but not attached to chromosomes, is found in the spermatogonia, but 

 not in the spermatocytic mitoses; its fibres and the pole fibres are 

 formed from the cytoplasm. The mantle fibres, on the other hand, 

 those connecting the chromosomes with the centrosomes, are derived 

 from linin fibres previously connected with the chromosomes — the 

 mantle fibres are at least in great part nuclear in origin. Whatever 

 be our views upon the nature of the pole and central fibres, whether we 

 regard them as lines of currents or as actual fibrils, I think we must 

 consider the mantle fibres as contractile fibrils, not simply paths of 

 movements of fluids. This follows clearly from the results of my Per-i- 

 patus paper, where the mantle fibres of mitosis were shown to be 

 derivable from linin fibrils stretched out through the nucleus in the 

 rest stage, and there constituting a continuous linin thread (spirem) 

 with many fine collateral branches. Such fibrils crossing one another 

 in all directions in the resting nucleus cannot be considered current- 

 paths; how, then, change into current-paths during mitosis, except in 

 so far as we regard a contracting gum-elastic cord to be a path of move- 

 ment? What holds for the mantle fibres need not, however, obtain for 

 the pole and central spindle fibres. The other achromatic spindle 

 constituents of nuclear origin are the connective fibres, fibres pulled 

 out between two separating daughter chromosomes; these are clearly 

 derived from the linin forming the matrix within which the chromatin 

 of a chromosome is imbedded or the sheath by which it is surrounded. 

 When two daughter chromosomes separate in metakinesis it has the 

 appearance as though two connective fibres pass between them; but it 

 is more likely that such two lines represent in actuality the boundaries 

 (visible because of their higher refraction) of a solid or hollow linin 

 cylinder. 



Already in the monaster stage of the spermatogonia (Plate IX, fig. 9) 

 as of the first spermatocytes (fig. 32) there is a pair of centrosomes at 

 each spindle pole . After each spermatogonia division these centrosomes 

 wander through an arc of 180° to take up a position on the opposite 

 side of the nucleus ; the same process seems to take place in the sper- 

 matid ; but before the second maturation mitosis each wanders through 

 an arc of only 90°. In the first maturation mitosis there are two man- 

 tle fibres from each spindle pole to each chromosome (Plate IX, figs. 

 32-33; Plate X, figs. 34-36); in the second only one (fig. 39). This is 

 understandable on the basis that the first mitosis is reductional, 

 since, as is most clearly shown in a straight dumbbell-shaped bivalent 




174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



chromosome, one univalent chromosome is turned toward one spindle 

 pole and the other toward the opposite one, and each univalent chro- 

 mosome being longitudinally split the linin thread attaching it to the 

 spindle pole must be split into two ; for any longitudinal splitting of 

 the chromatin globules is always associated with, if indeed not induced 

 by, a splitting of the linin matrix, as is shown in the details of chro- 

 mosome formation, especially in the post-synapsis stage. If the first 

 maturation division were equational there would be no adequate 

 explanation for the double mantle fibres. As the centrosomes of the 

 second spermatocyte move apart preparatory to the second matura- 

 tion mitosis, each carries along with it one of the two mantle fibres 

 attached to each chromosome. 



2.— Spermatogenesis of Lycosa insopita Montg. 



The only published work upon Aranese is that of Carnoy (18S5), Wag- 

 ner (1896) and Wallace (1900). Miss Wallace's paper was done partly 

 under my direction, and is a short preliminary note dealing with the 

 accessory chromosomes, which she correctly found to be double in the 

 spermatocytes, but did not determine positively its behavior in the 

 maturation mitoses. Wagner's short paper I have not at hand, and 

 cannot now recall his conclusions. Carnoy described quite minutely the 

 process of cell division in male germ cells of a number of spiders, of Phal- 

 angium and Scorpio, illustrating both spermatogonic and spermatocytic 

 divisions (his whole plate V with its numerous beautiful figures) ; such 

 work has no direct bearing upon modern spermatogenetic study, in that 

 it does not consider the sequence of changes through the several cell gene- 

 rations. But it is but just to say of this study of this priest of Lou- 

 vaine, that it was in many respects the best work of its day upon cell 

 division. Most writers, following a certain antiquated German school, 

 have neglected to refer to him. But he pointed out that cell division 

 is not all of one kind, but that two main types of it occur, and this we 

 now know to be the case and term them respectively reduction and 

 equation divisions ; yet this was the main ground on which that particu- 

 lar German cult fought him. And he undoubtedly saw much more 

 than many a later investigator, and lacked only a general standpoint 

 of interpretation. 



Testes w^ere studied of an adult male caught in October; they were 

 fixed and stained by the methods used for Syrbula. The testes are 

 slender, cylindrical tubes, and on account of the difficulty of removing 

 them entire from the fresh animal, one proceeds best by cutting off the 

 abdomen from the living animal, removing the h3qpodermis, fixing the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175 



whole abdominal visceral mass, then dissecting out the testes in distilled 

 water. 



The spermatogonia form the inner epithelium of the organ, and by 

 their last divisions the spermatocytes formed lose their connection with 

 this ceU layer and come to lie free within the lumen of the testis ; in this 

 cavity are found all stages of the growth period, the maturation 

 mitoses, the spermatids and spermatozoa. In any transverse plane of a 

 testis one finds the same series of stages. Not only in the arrangement 

 of the cells within the testis, but also in the process of spermatogenesis 

 this spider shows close resemblance to Peripatus; in both, e.g., the 

 longitudinal split of the bivalent chromosomes is very clear, and during 

 the synapsis stage the chromatin loops are not so densely massed but 

 that each may be distinguished. 



Only two clear cases of pole views of the equatorial plate of spermato- 

 gonia were found. On one of these (Plate X, fig. 41) exactly twenty- 

 eight chromatin elements could be distinctly counted. In the other 

 case the chromosomes were more densely grouped, and I could not be 

 certain whether there were twenty-eight or thirty of them ; it w^as possi- 

 ble that tw^o of them were already dividing in metakinesis. Tw^o of these 

 spermatogonic chromosomes are very small (S.) ; the subsequent history 

 of these could not be ascertained with any degree of certainty. There 

 are accordingly twenty-six larger chromosomes, all of which can be 

 recognized in the thirteen bivalent chromosomes of the first spermato- 

 cyte. All of these appear to be longitudinally halved during the ana- 

 phase, so that each first spermatocyte receives twenty-six daughter 

 chromosomes. 



There is no rest stage at any period of the spermatocytic history. 

 Shortly after the last spermatogonic mitosis commences the synapsis 

 stage (figs. 42-44). At its beginning (fig. 42) the daughter chromo- 

 somes are elongated threads, already commencing to join into pairs (at 

 the points lettered x). But two of them (N. 2) differ in maintaining 

 the dense contour and smooth outline characteristic of mitosis; these 

 are the heterochromosomes, and there is clearly one pair of them. 

 Accordingly, of the twenty-six large chromosomes of the spermatogonia 

 two are heterochromosomes, though they cannot be recognized in the 

 spermatogonic monaster stage nor yet in the preceding rest stage. In 

 following synaptic stages (figs. 43, 44) the twenty-six chromosomes 

 unite to form thirteen bivalent pairs. This takes place, as in Peripatus, 

 by an approximation or even close fusion of every two chromosomes of 

 similar length at their ends directed toward the central pole of the 

 nucleus (that one farthest removed from the greatest mass of cyto- 




176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



plasm). During this process there appears to be a continuous Hnin 

 spirem, but no continuous chromatin spircm; the bivalent chromo- 

 somes in the form of V's or U's are arranged upon the linin thread so 

 that their free ends are toward the distal nuclear pole. The distal ends 

 of each V are rarely contiguous with those of a neighboring one, though 

 that is sometimes the case, but, as the figures show, they are usually 

 slightly separated. Between the distal end of one univalent component 

 of a V and the corresponding end of a similar component of another V 

 can be seen, whenever these structures lie in the same plane, a connect- 

 ing linin thread. These phenomena are so similar to those in Peripatus 

 that I think it unnecessary to describe them all in detail again, and 

 refer to the very detailed account of the Peripatus paper. A pole view 

 of a nucleus in the synapsis stage shows the optical cross-section of 

 twenty-six chromatin loops, and lateral views demonstrate the presence 

 of thirteen V's. Each V, therefore, corresponds to two univalent 

 chromosomes of the spermatogonia ; it is a bivalent structure in which 

 each arm represents one chromosome, and has been formed by the 

 conjugation of two end to end and not by transverse scission of a con- 

 tinuous chromatin spirem. Where the ends of two conjugated univa- 

 lent chromosomes come together (the points marked x in these and the 

 subsequent figures) is frequently found a slight notch or break, which 

 is a connecting band of linin — corresponding to the central linin band 

 in Peripatus. That the space between the two arms of a V is not a 

 longitudinal split is indubitable, for stages like that of fig. 42 show 

 previously separated chromosomes coming together. The longitudinal 

 split appears in the long axis of each univalent chromosome (figs. 

 42-44), and proceeds latest to their distal ends (those directed toward 

 the distal pole of the nucleus). No earlier longitudinal split occurs, and 

 no later one. A nuclear membrane appears first at the close of the 

 synapsis. 



The behavior of the heterochromosomes can be followed with equal 

 facility and certainty. All through the growth period they preserve 

 their smooth contours, compact structure and strong affinity for chro- 

 matin stains. The two univalent heterochromosomes (N. 2, fig. 42) 

 come together and conjugate side to side (figs. 4.3, 44), though their ends 

 directed toward the distal nuclear pole are in closer touch than their 

 opposite ends, in contrast to the behavior of the other chromosomes. 

 So is produced a bivalent heterochromosome, throughout the growth 

 period placed against the distal pole of the nucleus, consisting of two 

 univalent chromosomes lying parallel or more usiially in the form of a 

 much narrowed V. It does not increase in size in the following stages, 




1905.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 177 



and its only perceptible change is a longitudinal split of each univalent 

 component. This is shown in fig. 446ts, A. and B, which show merely 

 the bivalent heterochromosome and an arc of the contiguous nuclear 

 membrane. In most cases the space of this split is widest at the inner 

 ends of the univalent components of this bivalent heterochromosome, 

 as shown in fig. A. This longitudinal split cannot be seen from every 

 point of vision, but only when the heterochromosome lies in particular 

 directions, as is quite understandable. 



Following the synapsis is a post-synapsis stage, with the bivalent 

 chromosomes more evenly distributed through the nucleus (figs. 45, 

 46). The longitudinal split is wide and very evident, but does not 

 extend through the distal ends of the still generally V-shaped loops. 

 In each bivalent chromosome the angle of the V (a; of the figures) is 

 the point of junction of two univalent parts. Here also the longitudi- 

 nal split of the bivalent heterochromosome (A^. 2) can sometimes be 

 seen. No nucleolus is formed in any part of the growth period. 



Immediately succeeding are the prophases of the maturation mitoses 

 (figs. 47-52). There occurs in them a gradual shortening and conden- 

 sation of the chromosomes, leading to narrowing or even complete 

 temporary obliteration of the longitudinal split. This split in the early 

 prophases (figs. 47-49) in the case of some of the chromosomes becomes 

 a little wider than during the post-synapsis (figs. 45, 46) ; so with the 

 chromosomes marked H in these figures. But this happens with only 

 a minority of the chromosomes in any nucleus. And it is not a definite 

 stage in the structural change of every chromosome, for the reason of 

 its relative infrequency. Most of the chromosomes, on the contrary, 

 are straight or bent rods, and the angle or middle point of these marks 

 the point of conjunction of two univalent chromosomes (x of the figs. 

 47-52). Such chromosomes as those marked H in figs. 47 and 49 are 

 ones where the longitudinal split has become very wide at the point of 

 union of the two univalent chromosomes ; but even in such chromosomes 

 one axis always remains longer than the other, so that there is no evi- 

 dence of a bivalent chromosome becoming extended out in a hne at 

 right angles to its previous long axis. And even for these chromo- 

 somes, as is clearly the case with the others where there is no extensive 

 widening of the longitudinal split, the successive prophases lead toward 

 a narrowing or closure of this split. Regular rings appear not to be 

 formed. But chromosomes in the form of an X are not infrequent. 

 There is no difficulty in the interpretation of the form of these. For in 

 the one shown in fig. 51, marked D., the X is seen to be two univalent 

 chromosomes, each longitudinally split, joined by their middle points; 

 12 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



an X is then obviously formed from a V, not by any extension of the 

 longitudinal split, but simply by the point of contact of the two uni- 

 valent chromosomes shifting its position. The decisive phenomenon 

 through these prophases is that most of the chromosomes preserve their 

 original forms of bent rods, or modify them into straight rods, leading 

 toward the forms most frequent at the end of the prophase (fig. 52), 

 where the earlier point of union of two univalent chromosomes is 

 recognizable (x), and the longitudinal split sometimes still discernible. 

 For the greater number of the chromosomes the changes of the pro- 

 phases lead to the retention of approximately their original form, but 

 with a gradual partial or complete closure of the longitudinal split; 

 and there is no reason to hold that the longitudinal split ever widens 

 and remains open in such a manner as to change the position of the 

 long axis of a bivalent chromosome. The heterochromosome under- 

 goes no marked modification during the prophases; at first each of its 

 univalent portions shows still the longitudinal split, shown in end view 

 on fig. 49 (A^. 2), but toward the close of this period this split appears 

 to close up. 



In the equatorial plate of the first spermatocyte (figs. 53, 54) are 

 found thirteen larger bivalent chromosomes, and sometimes a minute 

 chromatin body (S.) which does not appear to be bivalent, at least it 

 is not bipartite. The latter may represent one of the tw^o minute 

 chromosomes of the spermatogonia (fig. 41) ; one of these small bodies 

 is occasionally found in the monaster stage of the second spermatocytes 

 (figs. 62, 63). Their behavior in the growth period could not be deter- 

 mined, so we must disregard them in our analysis of the chromosomal 

 relations. The first maturation figure has then thirteen bivalent 

 chromosomes, corresponding to the twenty-six larger univalent ones 

 of the spermatogonia. Lateral views of the first maturation spindle 

 are shown in figs. 55-5<S. "Wliile on most of the chromosomes at this 

 stage the longitudinal split is not evident, in some cases it is still per- 

 sistent, as notably in those lettered K in figs. 55, 56, 58. Particularly 

 the one in the last figin-e is valuable in demonstrating how the chromo- 

 somes become placed in the spindle: the point of junction (x) of the 

 two univalent components lies in the equator, therefore the one uni- 

 valent chromosome just above and the other just below this plane. 

 From this arrangement and from the mode of insertion of the mantle 

 fibres it is evident that in this mitosis the two univalent chromosomes 

 of each pair become separated from each other into opposite cells, and 

 that this is a reduction division. Generally the long axis of each biva- 

 lent chromosome is parallel to the axis of the spindle, which is always 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 179 



the case when its univalent parts are placed in one line. Sometimes, 

 as with the extreme right and left ones of fig. 57, the long axis of the 

 chromosome appears to lie in the equatorial plane ; this results also in 

 a reduction division, however, because here there is a bent instead of a 

 straight bivalent chromosome, with consequent convergent disposition 

 of the two univalent chromosomes. Lycosa is particularly demon- 

 strative of this first mitosis being a reduction mitosis, on account of the 

 simple form of the chromosomes and of the occasional perceptible per- 

 sistence of the longitudinal split at this stage. No chromosomal rings 

 occur at this stage; the nearest approach to them are oval forms like 

 the two largest in fig. 55, with very exceptional width of the longitudinal 

 split; such forms are individual variations, not found in every cell, 

 as one sees on comparison with pole views (figs. 53, 54) showing all the 

 chromosomes, yet even in them the original long axis of the chromo- 

 some is recognizable. 



In metakinesis (fig. 59) all the bivalent chromosomes undergo a 

 reductional halving. Figs. 60-63 show pole views of the chromosomal 

 plates of the daughter cells, second spermatocytes. Disregarding the 

 two minute bodies (S.) of 62 and 63, we find in 60 fifteen chromosomes, 

 in 63 fourteen, in 61 thirteen, in 62 twelve. There would then seem 

 to be a range in number from twelve to fifteen. This I believe is due 

 rather to some unexplained individual variation than to the possibliity 

 of a normal unequal distribution of the chromosomes. For in the nine 

 cases where they could be easily counted the numbers fifteen, fourteen 

 and twelve were each represented by only one case, whereas thirteen 

 appeared in six cases; and in the only two cases where the chromo- 

 somes of the second spermatocyte could be counted on lateral view 

 (one of these shown in fig. 65) there were in both cases thirteen chromo- 

 somes. There were thirteen bivalent chromosomes in the first sper- 

 matocyte, and the counts show that in the majority of cases, so prob- 

 ably as the normal phenomenon, there are thirteen univalent ones in 

 the second spermatocyte. As the chromosomes of the first spermato- 

 cyte separate in the anaphase (fig. 59) each daughter chromosome 

 shows a divergent split widest at the equatorial end ; this can be noth- 

 ing else than the reopening of the original longitudinal split, if one com- 

 pares the appearances in fig. 59 with the chromosome most to the left 

 in fig. 55. So each bent chromosome of the second spermatocytes 

 (figs. 60-65) is a univalent chromosome so split longitudinally that the 

 cleft is narrow at one end and widens out toward the other. There 

 is no proof of any kind that this is either a transverse break or a line of 

 separation between whole univalent chromosomes. 




180 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



The second maturation mitosis (figs. 64, 65) is accordingly an equa- 

 tional division. I have been unable to count the chromosomes in 

 the resultant daughter cells, spermatids, because of their massed ar- 

 rangement there, and therefore have not demonstrated that all the 

 elements become halved in this second mitosis. But all these thirteen 

 chromosomes are constricted or cleft, showing that each is therefore 

 probably longitudinally split; for this reason it is probable that each 

 spermatid receives thirteen chromosomes. 



As was the case in Syrhula so also in Lycosa the mode of division of 

 the bivalent heterochromosomes was not positively determined. In 

 the spermatocytes it can always be distinguished by its smooth outline 

 and compact structure only up to the tune when the other chromo- 

 somes acquire their final shape. Yet among the chromosomes of the 

 first mitosis there seems to be no particular one markedly different from 

 the others. But on lateral view of the spindle (fig. 56) there is some- 

 times one (0 quite different from the others, in the form of two elon- 

 gated rods; and its division is shown in fig. 58 (0- This may be the 

 heterochromosome, but there is no satisfactory evidence for this con- 

 jecture. We found that in the synapsis this was formed, like the ordi- 

 nary chromosome, by a conjugation of two univalent ones, and that 

 each univalent one underwent a longitudinal splitting. This similarity 

 in formation is some evidence that the heterochromosome may behave 

 like the others during the maturation mitoses, namely, that it may 

 undergo a reductional division in the first and an equational in the 

 second mitosis. And wc can say positively that the whole bivalent 

 heterochromosome does not pass undivided into one of the second 

 spermatocytes. 



In both maturation divisions the centrosomes of both spindle poles 

 touch the cell membrane (figs. 55-59, 64). As in the other objects 

 studied by me there is no intermediate cell plate formed after the reduc- 

 tion division, but after all other divisions. 



3. — Occurrence and Time of the Reduction Mitosis. 



Korschelt (1903), in his excellent review upon the maturation phe- 

 nomena, distinguishes two types of maturation: the ''eumitotic," 

 where both mitoses are equational, and the "pseudomitotic," where 

 one of them is reductional. But these should be considered collective 

 terms for groups of divergent opinions, rather than a classification of 

 actually occurring natural phenomena. The general consensus of 

 opinion at the present time, the greater part of all the more recent work 

 on most diverse animals, is conclusive for the decision that a rediic- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 181 



tional mitosis, a separation of whole univalent chromosomes, occurs in 

 many objects. In all the works where two successive equational divi- 

 sions have been described, it is significant that no positive explanation 

 has been given of the earliest mode of origin of the bivalent chromo- 

 somes, not even in the detailed study of Brauer (1893), and the same 

 may be said of the recent elaborate analysis of de Sinety (1901). All 

 the "cumitotic" investigators seem to have interpreted as a first longi- 

 tudinal splitting of the chromosomes a space which they have not 

 proved to be such, and which the observations of others show to be in 

 all probability the space between two conjugated univalent chromo- 

 somes. They likewise fail to account for the fact that the chromo- 

 somes in the reduction divisions so frequently differ in form from all 

 other chromosomes, and leave undecided the question of the origin 

 of the bivalent chromosomes. It is not necessary to go further into 

 detail here upon this point, on which I have expressed myself many 

 times previously. But we can say positively that there has not yet 

 been proved any case of eumitotic maturation in the sense of Korschelt : 

 that even in Ascaris, the foundation-stone of this doctrine, Sabasch- 

 nikoff (1897) has shown that Boveri (1888), Hertwig (1890) and Brauer 

 (1893) may have given a wrong analysis, while recently Boveri (1904) 

 himself and I (1904a) have argued for the probable occurrence of a 

 reduction division here; and for the vertebrates also Iving (1901), 

 Schreiner (1904), Marechal (1904) and I (1903, 1904a) have proved the 

 same contention. While this dispute will not be settled for some time, 

 for the reason that scarcely a beginning has yet been made in the study 

 of the germ cells, I do not hesitate to declare that in none of the Metazoa 

 does maturation of the eumitotic type occur. And I make this pro- 

 phecy after starting from the point of view (1898) that there may 

 well be different modes of maturation, and consequently I can surely 

 not be accused of starting out on my studies w^ith bias in any particular 

 direction. 



Further, all evidence of any strength is to the effect that probably in 

 no case are both maturation divisions reductional. This standpoint 

 has been held by Wilcox (1895) and a few others, and by myself in my 

 first paper (1898), but I quickly discovered and corrected this initial 

 error (1899). To this "Correction" another correction must be made: 

 in the note of 1899 I wrote that the second maturation may be occa- 

 sionally reductional, occasionally equational; this was a mistake, for 

 now I can say there is in Pentatoma (Euchistus) no evidence at all of 

 reductional division in the second mitosis. 



All maturation modes are then of the pseudomitotic type, and of 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



these Korschelt distinguishes a "Prereduction," where the first mitosis 

 is the reductional one, from a "Postreduction," where the second one is 

 reductional. Until quite recently I held that it was not of great 

 physiological importance which of these mitoses was reductional, pro- 

 vided that in all cases one of them was. But my own studies, extended 

 over a diversity of objects, have convinced me that very probably there 

 maintains a uniformity here also, even though the understanding of it 

 may not be immediately forthcoming. For surely out of the endless 

 diversity in small details a larger uniformity is gradually showing itself, 

 and as scientific thinkers it is our object to discover the uniformity. 

 The minutiae of phenomena are but stepping-stones, and too often 

 slippery ones, toward simple and broad concepts. By analogy with 

 other natural phenomena we should a 'priori expect uniformity rather 

 than diversity. From this standpoint I enter upon the discussion 

 again, with the conviction that all maturation plans must be either 

 prereductional or all postreductional, and that there can be no com- 

 promise. In our decision we must argue from the facts presented in 

 the early growth period of the ovocytes and spermatocytes, from their 

 first mode of formation and axial relations to each other, and not from 

 analyses of their definitive forms. Other things being equal, such 

 evidence must have the most weight which considers in the greatest 

 detail the full sequence of stages, and most particularly such as treats 

 minutely the early growth period. Too often follows upon a short and 

 incomplete series of observations a long discussion in print of possibili- 

 ties and probabilities, like shuffling with an incomplete pack of cards, 

 instead of an attempt to settle the matter with the microscope. 



The foundation of the argument for postreduction is in the work of 

 Hacker and Riickert upon the Copepoda, and with but few exceptions 

 this has been allowed to go unchallenged. On that account the facts 

 of these workers call for careful examination. 



Riickert (1894) studied the ovogenesis in three genera from the stage 

 of the young ovocyte up to the monaster stage of the first maturation 

 mitosis. From the number of chromosomes present in young blasto- 

 meres of one of these, he concluded that each chromosome of the ovo- 

 cyte is bivalent, eciual to two. He described most fully Cyclops 

 strenuus, so that we will examine his work upon this species. His figs. 

 4-8 present stages of the earlier growth period, by no means a complete 

 series. The first ovocyte in these stages has eleven chromosomes, each 

 in the form of two more or less closely apposed rods. Riickert assumes 

 that each of these is a longitudinally split chromosome; but while he 

 correctly assumes that each is bivalent, he does not determine the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



boundaries of each univalent component at this stage, but from condi- 

 tions in later stages (his figs. 9-22) concludes that the middle point of 

 each double rod is such a boundary. This is the weak point in his 

 whole analysis. For why may not each of the single rods be a whole 

 univalent chromosome, the bivalent One being formed then by a con- 

 jugation side to side of two univalent ones? None of his figures in the 

 least exclude this possibility. And here may be recalled Lerat's (1902) 

 somewhat inclusive observations also upon Cyclops, to the effect that 

 each such double rod may be so constituted. Then there is a great 

 break in Riickert's observations between the stages of his figs. 8 and 9, 

 the one apparently a post-synapsis or equivalent early stage, the latter 

 an advanced prophase; yet within just this undescribed period we 

 would expect great changes in the form of the chromosomes, such, for 

 instance, as the appearance of an indubitable longitudinal split. He 

 states that each double rod in the prophase bends at the middle, and 

 later breaks transversely into two at this point; this he conceives to 

 be a separation of the univalent chromosomes at the point at which 

 they had hitherto been united. But he presents no positive evidence, 

 certainly not in his drawings, that this is not the appearance of a longi- 

 tudinal split of each univalent element, a split whereby the halves 

 would remain attached at one end and gradually separate at the other 

 (just as has been described for other objects), opening up from a narrow 

 V to a condition in which the separated halves of one univalent chromo- 

 some come to lie together in one straight line. The uppermost chromo- 

 some of his fig. 116 is evidence of such a possibility. Accordingly, 

 though the bivalent chromosomes lie so in the equator of the first pole 

 spindle that their long axes coincide with this plane, and their "trans- 

 verse " splits are at right angles to it, this does not prove the first mitosis 

 to be equational. For all the proof he brings to the contrary, the open- 

 ing along the length of each bivalent chromosome may be a line sepa- 

 rating its two univalent components, and the first division therefore 

 reductional. Riickert does not convince, though his is in many re- 

 spects the most careful work yet done upon these forms, because of 

 the hiatus in his stages, and because, and this is the cardinal issue, he 

 failed to decide the mode of origin of the bivalent chromosomes. 



I have not at hand Hacker's earlier papers (1891, 1892, 1893), and 

 so quote from Riickert (I.e.) his opinions: "Zuerst hat er die Reduk- 

 tion in die erste, dann in beide und zuletzt in die zweite Teilung ver- 

 legt." In later papers (1895, 1899) he confirms Riickert's view that 

 the reduction is effected in the second maturation mitosis; though I 

 cannot see that in so doing he brings any stronger proof than did 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



Riickert. Change of view is no dishonor but a sign of courage, and I 

 respect any man for it, for it is not easy to discard an idea for which 

 one has fought; but in scientific thought we expect change of view to 

 be an accompaniment only of the discovery of more urgent facts. 

 Such facts we do not find in Hacker's latest work (1902, 1904). He had 

 previously observed that in Cyclops brevicornis the normal number of 

 chromosomes is twelve, and that in the ovocytes before the maturation 

 divisions there are six bivalent ones; that these divide equationally 

 in the first and reductionally in the second spindle, so that the ovotid 

 receives six univalent ones. But now he maintains this is wrong, that 

 the chromosomes at all periods of the first ovocyte while bivalent are in 

 the normal number, and that there is no union of them into pairs during 

 the growth period. I have already criticised (19046) this view, and 

 in his retort (19046) Hacker has failed to take up the cardinal issue and 

 give further proof. He describes (1902) that in the ovocyte these 

 twelve bivalent chromosomes are arranged in two planes of six each. 

 This is not borne out by his figs, 30-34. He came to this strange con- 

 clusion in a roundabout way from observations upon the gonomerity 

 of the nucleus, holding that even at the time of the first maturation 

 division the chromosomes are arranged in two planes, corresponding to 

 the earlier gonomeres of the nucleus, one layer of them being maternal 

 and the other paternal. The only evidence for this are certain lines 

 or septa said to divide the ''provisory division figure" transversely and 

 longitudinally. No one has corroborated the existence of such septa, 

 and I have looked in vain for them upon a number of objects ; he gives 

 only lateral views of these structures, does not show their origin, and 

 does not make it plain whence their substance is derived. Yet, fairly 

 speaking, this may be said to be the whole observational basis for his 

 new involved analysis ! Each ovocyte of the second order is said to 

 receive twelve bivalent chromosomes; and then follows a union of 

 tetrads into pairs. ''Bei der ersten Richtungsteilung gelangen, wie 

 bei jeder anderen Kernteilung, je 6 vaterliche und 6 miitterliche Ele- 

 mente in die Tochterkerne, jedoch erfolgt die dicentrische Wanderung 

 nicht in zwei gesonderten, den elterlichen Anteilen entsprechenden 

 Gruppen, sondern die vaterlichen und miitterlichen Elemente miissen, 

 ihrer Aufstellung in den zwei Frontenentsprechend, zwischen einander 

 durchtreten und sind also vollkommen durcheinander gemischt, 

 wahrend sie an die Pole wandern (Textfig. Cb). Diese Mischung ist 

 jedoch, wie wir gesehen haben, keine unregelmassige. Denn es liesst 

 sich mit gr5sster Wahrscheinlichkeit zeigen, dass bei der unmittelbar 

 folgenden Paarung der Spalthalften die Paarlinge jewcils zwei im 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



sekundaren Keimblaschen einander opponierten Vierergmppen ange- 

 horen. Es muss sich also schon die dicentrische Wanderung in einer 

 ganz gesetzmassigen, Quadrillenahnlichen Ordnung vollziehen, mdgen 

 dabei regulierende, von den Chromatinelementen selbst ausgehende 

 Reize oder irgend welchc als Leitbahnen dienenden Kernstrukturen 

 eine Rolle spielen. Bei der Paarung der Spalthalften erfolgt die 

 Vereinigung je einer vaterlichen und einer miitterlichen Spalthalfte. 

 Von den beiden einander opponierten Vierergmppen ^ und -^ werden 

 sich z. B. jeweils zwei Spalthalften ab und no miteinander verbinden 

 und das Gesamtresultat des sersten Teilungschrittes ist demnach eine 

 gleichmassige Durchmischung der vaterlichen und miitterlichen Anteile 

 (Textfig. Cb unten)." This recalls Fol's (1891) quadrille of the centro- 

 somes! The result of it all amounts to this: spermatid and ovotid 

 have each six bivalent chromosomes, the fertilized egg has twelve 

 bivalent chromosomes, and the same number is found in the first polar 

 spindle where they are arranged in two planes; each second ovocyte 

 receives twelve bivalent chromosomes, and there unite into six quadri- 

 valent chromosomes; and these undergo a reduction division in the 

 second mitosis, so that the ovocyte receives six that are bivalent. 

 This analysis is so intricate and complex, so little borne out by the frag- 

 mentary and somewhat doubtful evidence — only certain lines travers- 

 ing a nucleus — that we can charitably say thepaper is its own strongest 

 critic. It is to be much regretted that Hacker has used these results 

 in a general review (1904) of bastardization, because they are irrecon- 

 cilable with all other work, and tend to make the supposed diversity 

 and contradictoriness of the germ cell phenomena even more marked 

 than ever before. We are not in any need of "Referate/' but very 

 pressing need of more observations. 



The work of Linville (1900) on Limncca is not conclusive, for the 

 chromosomes are very minute and the prophases were not studied at 

 all; the same may be said of Francotte's (1898) study of Polyclades, 

 where the only figures are indistinct microphotographs. The investi- 

 gations of Van der Stricht (1898) and von Khnckowstrom (1897) upon 

 Polyclades have been strongly contradicted by Schockaert (1902), 

 who has given a much more detailed examination than either of these 

 writers. The papers of Prowazck (1901, 1902) I have not seen. Miss 

 Wallace's paper (1900) is admittedly indecisive, and Griffin's (1899) 

 studies on Thalassema and Zirphcea concern chromosomes of very intri- 

 cate forms and small size, and their behavior was elucidated (or should 

 we say nigrificd?) by an analysis of their final shapes. So none of these 

 investigations are decisive in any manner that requires rigid proof from 

 a study of the whole series of changes.

There remain certain studies upon the spermatogenesis of insects, 

 the most deserving of attention of which are those of McCknig and 

 Gross. Vom Rath's studies of Gryllotalpa (1892, 1895) omit all the 

 earliest stages of the growth period ; and while he takes the stand that 

 the maturation is postreductional, he grants the possibility of its being 

 prereductional. McClung (1900, 1902) holds the postreductional 

 viewpoint, reasoning particularly^ from the forms of the definitive 

 chromosomes; in the late prophases of the first spermatocyte the bi- 

 valent chromosomes vary much in shape, rods, rings, crosses, and appa- 

 rently intermediate conditions. There is more uniformity in the first 

 maturation spindle. These difTerences in form McClung interprets as 

 successive stages and, to put it concisely, he argues that the axial rela- 

 tions of a chromosome change, so that if the long axis were originally 

 from right to left, it subsequently changes into a line at right angles to 

 this. X-shaped chromosomes are thereby interpreted as intermediate 

 stages in this transformation. His figures of Acridid spermatocytes 

 are very similar to those I give in the present paper of Syrbula of the 

 same family of the Orthoptera; but McClung holds that an elongate 

 bivalent chromosome placed with its long axis parallel to the first 

 mitotic spindle undergoes an equational division, therefore that the 

 line of separation of its univalent components lies along its length. 

 From the assumption that the diverse forms of chromosomes of the 

 late prophase are successive morphological stages he argues this change 

 of axial relations; and that might be justified if this premise were 

 proven. But that it is not is shown by the evidence given by me ( 1901a, 

 1904) that certain chromosome pairs are characterized by certain forms 

 in the spermatogonia as well as in the spermatocytes; a point which 

 Baumgartner (1904) has recently corroborated and amplified.^ Against 

 this evidence McClung does not bring satisfactory proof that the 

 differences in form express steps in axial changes. McClung's work 

 appears to be very accurate, but I cannot follow him in this interpreta- 

 tion, and would ask the critical reader to compare his descriptions and 

 figures with those on the related object given in the present paper. To 

 prove his point he has to assume a complex axial metamorphosis, 

 which is wholly unnecessary on the basis of a prereduction. The same 

 criticism applies to the study of Gross (1904) on Syromastes, which is 



* In the paper just mentioned Baumgartner claims that Sutton discovered a 

 difference in size of the chromosomes, and states that he himself has "been fortu- 

 nate enough to find a difference in form." I think I was the discoverer of both 

 of these differences and expressed them distinctly for various forms, as Baum- 

 gartner will find stated in my papers of 1901 and 190-4. But he deserves credit 

 for distinguishing constant forms among chromosomes of the first spermatocytes. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



the strongest argument yet given for postreduction; he is the sohtary 

 worker on the spermatogenesis of Hemiptera who has taken the post- 

 reductional view, and does it from a supposed secondary change in 

 chromosomal form. Yet, strangely enough, he describes a prereduc- 

 tional division of the bivalent chromatin nucleolus, the only chromo- 

 some which is not said to pass through the stage of a cross! Its two 

 whole univalent components become separated from each other in the 

 first maturation mitosis. In his object the bivalent chromos®mes are 

 in some stages usually little longer than broad ; they approach in some 

 conditions more nearly the form of a cross than in any Hemipteron 

 which I have studied. Had Gross taken up my old object, Euchistus, 

 he would have found that X-shaped chromosomes do not occur at all, 

 or only very rarely, that the phenomena there are accordingly simpler 

 and more explicable than in Syromastes, and that intermediate forms 

 between a chromosome elongated in one direction and one stretched 

 out in another do not occur. Finally Gross admits that these forms 

 admit of another interpretation: "Man konnte mir entgegenhalten, 

 dass der von mir aus den Thatsachen erschlosene Modus der Tetraden- 

 bildung auf einer wdllkiirlichen, durch nichts bewiesenen Annahme 



beriihre Sichere Anhaltspunkte dafiir, nach welcher Richtung 



die Halften der Kreuzc aus einander weichen, lassen sich aus den beo. 

 bachteten Figuren nicht entnehmen." I fully agree with him in this- 

 But when he states, "Dasselbe gilt aber auch von der bis jetzt allge- 

 mein angenommenen Bildungsweise," he makes an error, for in some 

 cases of spermatogenesis cross-shaped chromosomes do not occur, and 

 that is so in Euchistus, and for such forms no voluntary assumptions are 

 necessary. Gross' work appears very accurate, and I criticise only his 

 interpretation of the crosses as intermediate forms. Evidently he is 

 considerably influenced by Hacker's latest views. The same general 

 criticism may be made of the work of Sutton (1902). 



When we review all this work supposed to prove a postreduction, 

 we find it based upon an incomplete series of stages, or upon forms 

 with minute chromosomes of very diverse form, or upon such as have 

 chromosomes in the form of rings and crosses. Every one will admit 

 that chromosomes of such shapes are the most difficult to interpret : a 

 tetrad with four parts of approximately equal size — where in it can we 

 say lies the plane of the longitudinal split and where the line separating 

 two univalent chromosomes? Just upon such chromosome forms is 

 much of the postreduction argument based. The correct, because only 

 decisive, method is not to reason from such forms, not to argue unneces- 

 sarily for a change in axis, but to explain such chromosome formation 




188 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Fcb., 



from objects where the phenomena are simpler, where the chromosomes 

 show a definite long axis in early stages, where the mode of formation 

 of the bivalent chromosomes has been worked out, and where forms like 

 rings and crosses do not occur. We must seek to explain the more 

 complex from the more simple, not force an interpretation from the 

 more complicated upon the more simple. The strongest argument for 

 postreduction is that of McClung and Gross, and yet they are reasoning 

 from the basis of perplexing rings and crosses. That such forms can 

 be explained in quite a different manner, and their first division be 

 regarded reductional instead of the second, I have shown for Peripatus, 

 where the series of changes of the linin elements as well as of the chro- 

 matic are clearer than in any object yet seen by me. 



To the idea of postreduction we can apply the criticism " not proven." 

 No one can say that it does not occur, yet I do not hesitate to state as 

 my opinion, coming from observations of some years upon a number 

 of different animal forms, that it will be proved not to occur. And this 

 is said with no intention of any disparity of the work of those who take 

 the contrary stand, for they have accumulated very important and 

 hard-won facts; it is only one of their interpretations that is being 

 criticised. Prereduction is based upon a simpler reasoning and to 

 some extent upon more patent phenomena. 



So we reach the conclusion that maturation phenomena are all of 

 the pseudomitotic tj^e of Korschelt, and only of the prereductional 

 kind. There is a mass of evidence for the view that in all cases the 

 first maturation is the reductional one. Korschelt (1895) has described 

 this for Ophryotrocha, Henking (1890) for Pyrrhocoris, Paulmier (1899) 

 for Anasa, King (1901) for Bufo, Nichols (1902) for Oniscus, Lerat 

 (1902) for copepods, Schockaert (1902) for Thysanozoon, Schreiner 

 (1904) and Marechal (1904) for fishes, McGill (1904) for Anax, Bouin 

 and Collin (1901) for myriapods, and I for Hemiptera of different fami- 

 lies (1898, 1899, 1901a and b), for Peripatus (1900), for salamanders 

 (1903, 1904), and in the present paper for a grasshopper and a spider. 

 And it will be noted that it is the most recent work which supports this 

 view. Quite as conclusive evidence comes from an examination of 

 the heterochromosomes, as we shall see later. Most of the recent work 

 upon the botanical side corroborates this point of view, as that of 

 Gregoire (1904), Rosenberg (1904), Strasburger (1904), Berghs (1904) 

 and Farmer and Moore (1903). 



From what I consider to be the strongest evidence available at the 

 present time we find the following series of phenomena during the 

 spermatogenesis of animals. There are a number of successive genera- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 189 



tions of spermatogonia, each with the normal number of univalent 

 chromosomes (the heterochromosomes will not be considered in this 

 place) ; all of their mitoses are equational. The last generation of them 

 produces the spermatocytes of the first order. At an early period in 

 these there takes place a pairing of the univalent chromosomes to form 

 bivalent ones, which may be a junction end to end or side to side.^ 

 This is in each case a pairing of a paternal chromosome (one derived 

 from the spermatid) with a maternal one (one from the ovotid). At 

 an early stage of the growth period the bivalent chromosomes become 

 more or less densely grouped, the synapsis stage, but the pairing of 

 the chromosomes may commence shortly before this time. After this 

 conjugation each univalent chromosome becomes longitudinally split, 

 and no second splitting follows the first. There may or may not be a 

 rest stage during the growth period, and when it occurs it may come 

 before or after the synapsis stage. In the first maturation mitosis 

 each bivalent chromosome undergoes a division in such a way that one 

 whole univalent element passes into one daughter cell, the other one 

 into the other cell ; this is a true reduction division in the sense of Weis- 

 mann, and accomplishes the reduction in number of the chromosomes; 

 their conjugation in the rest stage had not effected reduction, but only 

 the formation of pairs. The second maturation division is equational, 

 along the line of the longitudinal split, so that the spermatid receives 

 half the normal number, and each of them on comparison with those 

 of the first spermatocytes is semivalent, but on account of their increase 

 in size during the growth period virtually univalent. All the facts 

 speak for a strict preservation through the whole germinal cycle of the 

 individuality of the chromosomes. 



From the correspondence determined by Henking (1890) and Hert- 

 wig (1890) between spermatogenesis and ovogenesis, by the one for 

 insects and by the other for Ascaris, we might conclude that in all cases 

 of ovogenesis also prereduction occurs, as indeed has been described 

 for some animals. I think there is no sufficient evidence at present for 

 doubting this conclusion, and much in favor of it. Yet it must be 

 acknowledged that the ovogenetic processes are less easily analyzed, 



"^ Marechal is incorrect in stating that von Winiwarter (1900) first described 

 this process ; he simply reasoned that of three possible explanations of the origin 

 of the bivalent chromosomes this was the most probable. Henking (1890), 

 before von Winiwarter, had more conclusively argued for this, but did not see the 

 first steps in the process. I was the first (1900) to describe all the steps in this 

 series, and (1901a) to prove that each bivalent chromosome is formed by the 

 conjugation of a paternal and a maternal one — this corroborated in the next year 

 by Sutton (1902). Gross ('1904) is of course in error when he calls this the 

 "Hacker'sche Theorie." This important phenomenon is at last receiving rapid 

 confirmation from many sides. 




190 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



because of the larger growth period with its much greater degree of 

 metabohsm, which is responsible for a certain inclination, curiously 

 enough still surviving in some minds, to doubt the individuality of the 

 chromosomes. The cases of peculiar interest to the student of the 

 germ cells are parthenogenetically developing eggs. All the investi- 

 gators of parthenogenesis hold that both pole bodies represent equa- 

 tional divisions, or that the second is the reductional one; and very 

 general is the opinion that the second maturation mitosis being reduc- 

 tional, and the lack of formation, or secondary retraction, of the second 

 polar body being generally associated with normal parthenogenesis, it 

 is effected that by parthenogenesis the number of chromosomes does 

 not become halved. But there is no good ground for this view, and 

 parthenogenesis with fertilization following in a subsequent generation 

 is really better explained on the idea of a prereduction. For if the first 

 maturation is reductional and the second (equational) one is eliminated, 

 the parthenogenetic egg would have one-half the normal number of 

 chromosomes ; whether this number persists through all cell genera- 

 tions of the succeeding individual remains to be determined; there is 

 some evidence that it may do so. If the half number does persist, then 

 when an egg of the following individual becomes fertilized by a sperma- 

 tozoon the normal number would be restored, instead of being multiplied 

 one and a half times. This could not be effected if the second matura- 

 tion mitosis were reductional, and the second polar body not produced. 

 And of one point we can be reasonably certain: as Sutton (1903) has 

 reasoned, there is no probability that in a reduction mitosis all the 

 paternal chromosomes pass to one daughter cell and all the maternal 

 chromosomes to another; in other words, there is no evidence that 

 half the spermatids or ovotids contain only paternal elements and half 

 only maternal. Indeed, the chance of this would decrease inversely in 

 geometrical ratio with number of chromosomes. And therefore it is a 

 wholly unfounded assumption to conclude, as some have done with 

 greater ability in the construction of hypotheses than in reasoning 

 from phenomena, that either or both pole bodies eliminate all the "male 

 chromatin" (paternal chromosomes). The great weight of evidence 

 is in favor of the view that the first maturation mitosis reduces the 

 number of chromosomes, breaks apart the univalent components of 

 the bivalent chromosomes, but does not do it in such a way as to sepa- 

 rate all the paternal from all the maternal ; and those wiio have founded 

 hypotheses on contrary premises have been w^eaving ropes of sand.

4. — The Heterochromosomes. 



These were discovered but not correctly interpreted by Henking 

 (1890) and Wilcox (1895); first recognized as modified chromosomes 

 by Paulmier (1899) and myself (1898); then described for a variety of 

 Arthropoda by McCUmg (1899-1904), Sutton (1900, 1902), de Sinety 

 (1901), Wallace (1900), Gross (1904), McGill (1904), Baumgartner 

 (1904), myself (1901a and b, 1904a), Voinov (1903) and Prowazek 

 (1901) ; the last two papers I have not seen. In all these objects there 

 occur in the spermatogenesis peculiarly modified chromosomes, which 

 I have proposed (1904a) to include under the term "heterochromo- 

 somes." I had named them previously "chromatin nucleoli," though 

 with full appreciation of their chromosomal nature, Paulmier " small 

 chromosomes," McClung "accessory chromosomes," and de Sinety 

 "special chromosomes." Their essential characteristic is their differ- 

 ence in behavior from the other chromosomes in the growth period of 

 the spermatocytes and ovocytes, as sometimes during the rest stages 

 of the spermatogonia, a difference which appears usually to consist 

 in the maintenance of their compact structure and deep-staining inten- 

 sity, so that while the other chromosomes become long loops or even 

 compose a reticulum, these do not undergo any such changes or only to 

 slight extent. There is really not much known as yet of these modified 

 chromosomes despite extended studies upon them, and at this place I 

 wish mainly to draw attention to and try to explain differences in their 

 behavior during the matliration mitoses, and so endeavor to explain 

 certain phenomena that up to this time have been regarded as contra- 

 dictory. They appear to be of very general occurrence in insects, have 

 been found in spiders by ]\Iiss Wallace and by me (in the present paper), 

 but so far seem not to be demonstrated for other objects. To be sure 

 Blackman (1900) described an "accessory chromosome" in spermato- 

 cytes of Scolopendra, but did not describe its action in the spermato- 

 gonia nor even in the maturation mitoses, and has not proved in any 

 manner that this body is not a true nucleolus ; true nucleoli containing 

 chromatin or even chromosomes are relatively rare in metazoan cells, 

 but they sometimes occur (as, e.g., I have shown for the ovocyte of 

 Paragordius in a paper recently published), and what Blackman has 

 described appears to be such a structure. 



As I recently pointed out (1904a) there are two main kinds of hetero- 

 chromosomes : such as occur in pairs in the spermatogonia and unite 

 to form bivalent ones in the spermatocytes, which are the most frequent 

 kind in the Hemiptera and were named "chromatin nucleoli" by me; 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



and such as are unpaired or single in the spermatogonia and so do not 

 conjugate in the spermatocyte, which McChmg calls "accessory 

 chromosomes." Both these kinds agree essentially in their behavior 

 during the growth period of the spermatocyte, and are clearly distin- 

 guishable from the other ("ordinary") chromosomes by their compact 

 form and smooth outline ; they differ with regard to the point of being 

 single or double in the spermatogonia. Both kinds may occur in the 

 same animal, as I have shown (1901b) for Protenor. In Anasa I found 

 a pair of heterochromosomes in the ovogonia exactly like those in the 

 spermatogonia, which suggests that the paired heterochromosomes will 

 be found to occur in both maternal and paternal germ cells of the same 

 species; but whether unpaired heterochromosomes occur in maternal 

 germ cells is not known. 



Heterochromosomes that are paired in the spermatogonia and unite 

 to form bivalent ones in the spermatocytes I have described (1898, 

 1901a, 1901&, 1904a) for some forty species of Hemiptera, and in the 

 present paper for Lycosa (a spider) and Syrhula (an Orthopteron) ; 

 Henking (1890), Paulmier (1899) and Gross (1904) likewise for Hemip- 

 tera; and McQUll (1904) for Anax (an Odonate). Heterochromosomes 

 that are single in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes for Orphania 

 and Gryllus by de Sinety (1901), for Protenor by me (1901a), for Xiphi- 

 dium by McClung (1902), Brachijstola by Sutton (1900, 1902), and 

 Gryllus by Baumgartner (1904). 



Not to be confused with heterochromosomes are the "odd" chromo- 

 somes I described (1901a, h) for Alydus, Harmostes and (Edancola, 

 chromosomes that seem to behave exactly like any ordinary chromo- 

 some during the growth period of the spermatocytes, and cannot be 

 distinguished from them by any compactness of structure or intensity 

 of stain, except that they do not form bivalent chromosomes by conju- 

 gation with others. I called them odd because in cases where they are 

 present the spermatogonium has an odd or uneven number of ordinary 

 chromosomes, and the odd one is that which does not have a homologous 

 mate with which to pair during the synapsis stage. These resemble in 

 certain respects the unpaired heterochromosomes, but differ in not 

 maintaining a compact form during the growth period. These three 

 genera of Hemiptera are the only known cases where there is an uneven 

 number of chromosomes in the spermatogonia, without the odd chro- 

 mosome being a heterochromosome. 



And now we come to the point of the behavior of the heterochromo- 

 somes and the odd chromosomes during the maturation mitoses. 

 With regard to the heterochromosomes (chromatin nucleoli) that occur 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 193 



in pairs in the spermatogonia, I was able to determine the following 

 relations (1901). In all the species of Hemiptera these imite to form 

 one bivalent chromosome in the first spermatocytes, which appears 

 clearly double at the time of the first maturation mitosis. In Euchistus 

 variolarius, Hormostes, Protenor and CEdayicola the heterochromosomes 

 of this type divide rcductionally in the first mitosis, so that their uni- 

 valent components become separated; in the second mitosis each 

 divides again, by comparison with the other chromosomes probably 

 equationally, though I could not determine this in any decisive manner. 

 The same process Gross (1904) has described for the chromatin nucleoli 

 of Syromastes, and I have recently found it to hold for Euchistus tristig- 

 mus.^ For Anasa tristis, Alydus eurinus, Corizus, Oncopeltus, Calocoris, 

 Acholla and Zaitha I found (1901a) the bivalent heterochromosome 

 to divide reductionally in the first mitosis, but did not determine its 

 behavior in the second; this is also the case in Lygus, Nobis, Corizus, 

 as I showed in the supplementary paper (1901&). Paulmier (1899) 

 found the bivalent heterochromosome of Anasa to divide reductionally 

 in the first mitosis, but not to divide in the second, in agreement with 

 Henking's (1890) observations on Pyrrhocoris, and with those of IMcGill 

 (1904) on Anax. That the bivalent heterochromosomes of Syrhula 

 and Lycosa probably, but not certainly, divide first reductionally, then 

 equationally, in the two maturation mitoses is shown in the present 

 paper. Finally McClung (1900) describes for Hippiscvs an accessory 

 chromosome of the spermatocyte, said to divide in both maturation 

 mitoses; he does not describe the relations for the spermatogonia, but 

 it is quite probable to my mind that the phenomena in Hippiscus will 

 be found essentially similar to those determined by me for Syrhula, 

 namely, a bivalent heterochromosome in the first spermatocyte, 

 formed by the conjugation of two univalent heterochromosomes of 

 the spermatogonium. 



We can summarize the facts of the preceding paragraph, noting 

 parenthetically that for the details in the various species the reader 

 must refer to the original descriptions, in the following statement: 

 when heterochromosomes occur in pairs in the spermatogonia, i.e., 

 are of the type of " chromatin nucleoli," they always unite by conjuga- 



^ On a renewed study of my old preparations of the last species I find this to 

 be certainly the case, and my earher statement (1901a) was erroneous, to the 

 effect that "the bivalent heterochromosome divides first equationally, then reduc- 

 tionally. Also in my account of E. variolarius (19016) I stated the heterochromo- 

 some in the second mitosis "is not always divided"; that must be amended to 

 read "seems not always to be divided," in that in some of the spermatids it escapes 

 detection by its small size or by being covered by another chromosome.

194 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



tion to form bivalent ones in the first spermatocytes, and all the de- 

 scribers except McClung agree that in the first maturation mitosis they 

 always divide reductionally. No set of chromosomal structm-es is 

 better adapted than such heterochromosomes to prove prereduction: 

 there are two in the spermatogonium, which unite to form a bivalent 

 one in the spermatocyte, and the separation of the univalent halves of 

 the latter in the first mitosis is settled beyond any question of doubt 

 for almost all the cases — for all the cases in which they can be recog- 

 nized by peculiarities of form or size during this mitosis. Never in the 

 spermatocytes do they take on the puzzling forms of rings and crosses 

 which have misled so many good observers in the argument for post- 

 reduction. And it is significant that Gross (1904) shows the bivalent 

 heterochromosome of Syromastes is prereductional in its division, and 

 only by very indirect evidence attempts to show that the ordinary 

 chromosomes divide postreductionally. As to the behavior of this 

 kind of heterochromosome in the second maturation, for most of the 

 species nothing positive could be decided ; for other cases it has been 

 shown that in some cases it divides in the second mitosis (probably 

 equationally), as in Euchistus, Harmostes, Protenor, CEdancola, Syro- 

 mastes, Syrbula, Lycosa and Hippiscus, while it does not divide in this 

 second mitosis in Anasa, Pyrrhocoris and Anax. 



Secondly, as to the division of the heterochromosomes that occur 

 singly in the spermatogonia, and so undergo no conjugation in the 

 spermatocytes. Those of Orphania (de Sinety), Gryllus (de Sinety 

 and Baumgartner), Brachystola (Sutton), and Xiphidium (McClung 

 do not divide in the first maturation mitosis, but do so in the second. 

 Hence here again is prereduction: a whole chromosome passing imdi- 

 vided into one of the second spermatocytes, in the very mitosis which 

 all these observers consider to be equational ! The exceptional case is 

 the unpaired heterochromosome of Protenor ("chromosome x"), which 

 I described (19016) as dividing transversely in the first mitosis, but 

 not dividing in the second. I have recently gone over these old prepa- 

 rations with great care, and find nothing incorrect in my original 

 description. 



Thirdly, in regard to the divisions of the odd chromosomes of CEdan- 

 cola, Harmostes and Alydus, which occur singly in the spermatogonia 

 but are not heterochromosomes. In my original description (19016) 

 I did not determine their behavior positively in Alydus and Harmostes, 

 beyond showing that they do not divide in one of the mitoses, I 

 have recently studied them again, and find that in all these forms they 

 di\nde in the first maturation mitosis but not in the second, just as is 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 195 



the case with the unpaired heterochromosome of Protenor and what 

 Gross (1904) has called the "accessory chromosome" in Syromastes (to 

 which we shall reciir). They do not appear bivalent in the first sper- 

 matocytes ; and whether their division in the first maturation mitosis 

 is transverse or parallel to their long axis was not determined on account 

 of their nearly spherical form. 



Now to him who has had the patience to follow tWs account, which 

 gives only a brief statement of some of the results of previously 

 detailed observations, the occurrence and behavior of the two kinds of 

 heterochromosomes and of the odd ordinarj^ chromosomes may well 

 seem difficult to reconcile. But there is nevertheless a general con- 

 formity of process here, which has not been elucidated heretofore. 

 Whenever the heterochromosomes occur in pairs in the spermatogonia 

 they always conjugate to form bivalent ones in the first spermatocytes, 

 and their univalent components become separated in the first matura- 

 tion mitosis, i.e., divide prereductionally. This is strictly in confirma- 

 tion with the doctrine we have tried to lay down in this paper, that the 

 separation of entire univalent chromosomes, i.e., their reduction in 

 number, is always accomplished in the first mitosis. At the same time 

 we have to bear in mind that there is no evidence that chromosomes 

 divide in different ways in the first maturation mitosis, some equation- 

 ally and some reductionally ; it is very probable that does not happen, 

 and indeed until proof is brought to the contrary we are justified in 

 maintaining that it does not occur. This is an important premise in 

 interpreting the divisions of the heterochromosomes and ordinary 

 chromosomes that occur singly in the spermatogonia. Now in the 

 Orthoptera (Orphania, Gryllus, Xiphidium, Brachystola) the hetero- 

 chromosome is single in the spermatogonia; single, therefore, in the 

 spermatocytes, it does not divide in the first maturation mitosis, but 

 does in the second. Because it does not divide in the first mitosis it 

 must be either univalent or else already in the spermatogonia be com- 

 posed of two so firmly united that they cannot be divided in the reduc- 

 tion mitosis; its division in the second mitosis must be equational, 

 and all the descriptions show this to be so. Now in Protenor the case 

 is reversed; the single heterochromosome divides in the first mitosis, 

 but not in the second, exactly like the odd ordinary chromosomes of 

 the Hemiptera, but apparently the reverse of the single heterochromo- 

 somes of Orthoptera. Since this heterochromosome of Protenor and 

 the odd ordinary chromosomes of three other Hcmipteran species 

 divide during the reduction mitosis, these chromosomes must be 

 already bivalent within the spermatogonium — the single one there be 




196 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



two in close union, but not so close as to prevent their separation in the 

 reduction mitosis. There is some observational proof for this, in that 

 the odd chromosome or unpaired heterochromosome in the spermato- 

 gonium sometimes exhibits a transverse constriction, as if marking the 

 point where two had joined, in Harmostes and Protenor; and in Pro- 

 tenor the division of the heterochromosome in the reduction mitosis is 

 at right angles to its long axis. The failure to divide in the second mi- 

 tosis can only be ascribed to an incomplete process of longitudinal 

 splitting during the growth period. We can thus express the likeness 

 and difference between the single heterochromosomcs and odd ordinary- 

 chromosomes of the Hemiptera and the single heterochromosomes 

 of the Orthoptera; they all agree in dividing reductionally in 

 the fu-st maturation mitosis, whether by a separation of two uni- 

 valent components or by a transport of the whole chromosome into 

 one of the daughter cells; they differ merely in not undergoing or in 

 undergoing an equational splitting in the second mitosis. We can 

 sum this up in the statement: all chromosomes and heterochromo- 

 somes, be they paired or single in the spermatogonJa, divide reduction- 

 ally in the first maturation mitosis, whether this division consist in two 

 univalent components separating from each other or a single compo- 

 nent passing undivided into one of the second spermatocytes. 



And now we come to another point with regard to a general uniform- 

 ity of heterochromosomes. I first showed (1901a, h) that the ordinary 

 chromosomes in the spermatogonia are arranged in pairs, so that, e.g., 

 fom-teen chromosomes form seven pairs, the two of a pair being alike in 

 size ; and I showed for several species that w^henever spermatogonial 

 chromosomes show marked differences in size they can be recognized 

 again in the bivalent chromosomes of the spermatocytes. Sutton (1902) 

 corroborated this for Brachystola.* And later I showed (1904a) cor- 

 responding chromosomes in the spermatogonia are alike not only in 

 size but also in form. We have just seen, also, that one kind of hetero- 

 chromosomes, the chromatin nucleoh, occur in pairs in the spermato- 

 gonia — where there Is one bivalent one of these in the spermatoc}i:es it 

 corresponds to two in the spermatogonia. Further than this, we have 

 shown that the odd ordinary chromosomes of Hemiptera and the 

 unpaired heterochromosomes of Protenor must be regarded as already 



* Boveri (1904), in his recent re\aew, ascribes the main credit of this discovery 

 to Sutton (1902),' as others have done; but the point was very clearly stated in 

 my papers, illustrated on a number of species, and, furthermore, I demonstrated 

 that chromosomes of corresponding size conjugate to form the bivalent ones. 

 Quite a number of papers have come out recently with " new discoveries " 

 which had already been made in my papers on Peripatus and Hemiptera. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 197 



bivalent in the spermatogonium — there as a chromosome pair with the 

 components closely united instead of being, as with most of the chromo- 

 somes, separated. Can we go further than this, and consider the un- 

 paired heterochromosomes of the Orthoptera to be also already bivalent 

 in the spermatogonium, but with the univalent parts so closely united 

 that they do not become separated even in the reduction mitosis? The 

 heterochromosomes of the Orthoptera appear to be usually larger than 

 the ordinary chromosomes, which is the only observational evidence 

 for the idea that they may have the value of more than one chromo- 

 some, and sometimes they are much larger. Such evidence is, of 

 course, not at all sufficient. But should they be ultimately proven to 

 be bivalent in the spermatogonia, a further uniformity would evince 

 itself: all heterochromosomes and all ordinary chromosomes would be 

 paired in the spermatogonia, whether the two members of a pair be 

 separated there (umValent) or be united (bivalent) ; in the former case 

 they would become bivalent by conjugation for the first time in the 

 spermatocytes, in the second case they would pass over already bivalent 

 to the spermatocytes. In any event an even number of univalent 

 chromosomes in the spermatogonia and half that number of bivalent 

 ones in the spermatocytes would be the primitive (unmodified) condi- 

 tion, as it is the one most usually found. In the preceding paragraph 

 it was shown to be probable that the odd ordinary chromosomes of the 

 Hemiptera and the unpaired heterochromosome of Protenor are already 

 bivalent in the spermatogonia; this may or may not be the case with 

 the unpaired heterochromosomes of the Orthoptera, but if it is the 

 case, as I think is somewhat probable, then the following conclusion is 

 reached — a conclusion well based at least for the odd ordinary chromo- 

 somes and the unpaired heterochromosome of Protenor: heterochromo- 

 somes that are paired in the spermatogonia and become bivalent in the 

 spermatocytes would be an earlier condition, and would lead to the 

 later condition of heterochromosomes unpaired in the spermatogonia 

 by conjugation of their univalent components in spermatogonic cell 

 generations. In this way unpaired heterochromosomes would be later 

 modifications of the paired ; and in the same manner, unpaired ordinary 

 chromosomes later modifications of paired ordinary chromosomes. 

 Two univalent chromosomes of a spermatogonium might conjugate to 

 form one bivalent one before the spermatocyte stage, this would then 

 be an odd ordinary chromosome, which later might or might not become 

 an unpaired heterochromosome; or two ordinary chromosomes of a 

 spermatogonium might become heterochromosomes (chromatin nucle- 

 oli) but still remain univalent in this cell (conjugating not before the 




198 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



spermatocyte stage), and two such univalent heterochromosomes 

 might or might not later conjugate in a spermatogonium to form an 

 unpaired heterochromosome. On such a premise paired heterochromo- 

 somes and chromosomes within the spermatogonia would be an earlier 

 condition than unpaired ones, and unpaired heterochromosomes could 

 be formed in two ways. 



The conclusions of the preceding paragraph are put forward merely 

 as tentative suggestions, and in no sense as final conclusions; the phe- 

 nomena are too complex as yet for any thorough analysis and interpre- 

 tation. But amongst all this complexity a certain agreement in the 

 phenomena becomes evident, and this it is our business to discover. I 

 still see no reason, despite the criticisms of McClung, to modify my 

 original standpoint (19016), that there is a transmutation in chromo- 

 somal numbers just as in any other parts of the organization, and that 

 the heterochromosomes are chromosomes on the way to disappearance ; 

 following Paulmier's (1899) earlier contention that they are degenerated 

 chromosomes. McClung (1900, 1902) mges that they are frequently 

 larger than other chromosomes and show just as many signs of active 

 metabolism. But neither Paulmier nor I regarded them as dead 

 structures ; and I pointed out that they seem to have a different meta- 

 boKc energy from the ordinary chromosomes, because in some species 

 of Hemiptera they are regularly attached to the true nucleolus, which 

 condition the other chromosomes do not share, and have a different 

 position within the nucleus (almost always against its membrane). 

 There can well be no question that they are metabolically different, else 

 they would not behave so differently, with a peculiar autonomy. 

 McClung has described them only for Orthoptera, where they are fre- 

 quently the largest chromosomes. But the paired heterochromosomes 

 of the Hemiptera are usually the smallest of all, sometimes very minute 

 granules (as in Perihalus, Coenus, Trichopepla, Corizus, Coriscus, Pri- 

 onidus) ; and when there are several pairs within a cell, as, e.g., Acholla, 

 all of them are smaller than the other chromosomes. So I considered 

 them degenerate in the sense that they no longer carry on exactly the 

 same activities as the ordinary chromosomes, from which they must 

 be derived, but have taken on other energies and have in most of the 

 described cases become smaller. The excessively minute hetero- 

 chromosomes would then be the last perceptible stage in their history; 

 for surely there is no reason to consider this the first stage — to consider 

 them as orginating as buds from larger ordinary chromosomes. Un- 

 paired heterochromosomes do not conjugate during the growth period, 

 for the reason of the absence of a mate with which to unite; and in 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 199 



cases of bastardization between different species, as described by Guyer 



(1902) and Moenkhaus (1904), the maternal and paternal chromosomes 

 fail to conjugate. Or, if the parents have different numbers of chromo- 

 somes, some of those of the parent with the larger species are forced to 

 remain univalent during the growth period, as shown by Rosenberg 



(1903) for Drosera. Facts like these might suggest that the presence of 

 heterochromosomes has been produced by bastardization of species 

 with different number of chromosomes. But that could be the case 

 only of unpaired heterochromosomes; it would not explain the paired 

 ones, and we have found that the unpaired kind are probably derivable 

 from the paired. Again, they have been found in all insects in which 

 they have been sought for, or in nearly all, but it would be rash to con- 

 clude that all these species of insects have arisen as bastards between 

 parental forms with different chromosomal numbers. Therefore there 

 is no good reason to refer the heterochromosomes to any hybridization 

 process; and every reason to consider them as modified conditions of 

 the ordinary chromosomes, formed in some cases concomitantly with a 

 change in chromosomal number, probably from a higher number to a 

 lower, chromosomes with a different metabolic activity and on the way 

 to disappearance. A remarkable fact, for which I see no explanation 

 whatsoever, is their very general occurrence among insects, and their 

 absence elsewhere except in spiders; but they may be found in other 

 groups when the attention is given them that they deserve. McClung 

 (1902a) has put out the hypothesis that they are sex-determinants, 

 reasoning from the condition of the unpaired heterochromosome of Xiph- 

 idium; here only half of the spermatids receive the division products, 

 and he argues that its presence in them may determine the male sex. 

 This is only a hypothesis, and as yet we do not even know whether in 

 the ovocytes of such species similar heterochromosomes may not occur. 

 Indeed, whether spermatozoa with and those without heterochromo- 

 somes are equally capable of fertilization is not known, and would be 

 exceedingly difficult to determine. Further, in some species of Hemip- 

 tera all the spermatozoa receive division products of the heterochromo- 

 somes, and on McClung's hypothesis all spermatozoa in such species 

 would produce males. 



On the question of the perpetuation from generation to generation 

 of an odd number of heterochromosomes or ordinary chromosomes I 

 have touched at another place (1901&); but now I am convinced it is 

 inutile to discuss this problem until we have facts of their behavior in 

 the maternal germ cells. 



In conclusion, attention should be drawn to the recent divergent 




200 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Feb., 



ideas of Gross (1904). He describes for Syromastes, a Hemipteron, two 

 pairs of modified chromosomes: one pair of these, which he calls chro- 

 matin nucleoli, differ from the other chromosomes in acting like hetero- 

 chromosomes during the growth period of the spermatocytes, but agree 

 with them in dividing in both maturation mitoses; the other pair, which 

 he calls accessory chromosomes, differ from the ordinary chromosomes 

 in not dividing during the second maturation mitosis, but behave ex- 

 actly like them during the growth period. His chromatin nucleoli, which 

 are not recognizable until the stage of the spermatocytes, are said not 

 to differ in volume from the ordinary chromosomes in the spermatogo- 

 nia; while his accessory chromosomes are described as the smallest of 

 all the chromatin elements. Both kinds of these bodies are paired and 

 univalent in the spermatogonia, and by conjugation become bivalent 

 in the spermatocytes. Now Gross reasons these are separate genealogi- 

 cal conditions of one and the same structure. He argues that a pair 

 of unmodified ordinary chromosomes of the spermatogonium become 

 in the spermatocytes chromatin nucleoli, which there act like hetero- 

 chromosomes, preserve their compact structure and undergo no longi- 

 tudinal split, and divide in both maturation mitoses, so that each sper- 

 matid receives a half of each univalent component. A spermatozoon 

 formed from such a spermatid unites with an ovotid with a correspond- 

 ing semivalent chromatin nucleolus. But instead of these two semi- 

 valent heterochromosomes (chromatin nucleoli) of the fertilized egg 

 appearing in the next following generation of spermatogonia as chro- 

 matin nucleoli, he conceives them to appear in the form of the pair of 

 small accessory chromosomes, which form a bivalent one in the follow- 

 ing spermatocyte, divide in the first maturation mitosis but not in the 

 second, so that half of the spermatids receive a half of each of them. 

 So he interprets them both as chromosomal elements whose maturation 

 divisions are continued over two generations of individuals; although 

 he really describes three divisions of them, two for the chromatin nucle- 

 oli and one for the accessory chromosomes. We need not enter here 

 upon his further deductions from this interpretation, but shall consider 

 simply its probability. A strong objection that suggests itself is this : 

 all the individuals studied by him showed in the spermatocytes two 

 chromatin nucleoli and two accessory chromosomes; but this would 

 be impossible if in every other generation the chromatin nucleoli 

 changed into accessory chromosomes, for then one should find in the cells 

 of some individuals no chromatin nucleoli but four accessory chromo- 

 somes. And if, and Gross suggests this possibility, from time to time 

 successive pairs of ordinary chromosomes become chromatin nucleoli. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 201 



then in the course of time all the chromosomes would become chromatin 

 nucleoli; yet in no individuals were found more than one pair. So from 

 whatever standpoint we regard his explanation its improbability be- 

 comes manifest. On the other hand his chromatin nucleoli behave 

 exactly like the chromatin nucleoli (paired heterochromosomes) of 

 Euchistus, except that they are not distinguishable in the spermato- 

 gonia (in some other Hemiptera they are also not recognizable in these 

 cells) ; so there is every reason to consider them as persisting from indi- 

 vidual to individual as chromatin nucleoli. What he calls in Syro- 

 mastes the accessory chromosomes are not heterochromosomes at all, 

 so certainly not later stages at all of chromatin nucleoli, for he describes 

 them as conducting themselves exactly like the ordinary chromosomes 

 during the growth period ; the bivalent accessory chromosome of the 

 spermatocytes differs only from the other bivalent chromosomes in 

 failing to divide in the second mitosis. I think this " accessory chromo- 

 some " of Syromastes is to be considered a stage leading to that of the 

 unpaired heterochromosome of Protenor; they resemble each other in 

 failing to divide in the second maturation mitosis, and though the one 

 in Protenor is virtually single in the spermatogonia we have given 

 reasons to show that it is probably bivalent there. The failure to 

 divide in the second mitosis can for both be ascribed to incompleteness 

 of the longitudinal split. And this is surely a far simpler interpretation 

 of the phenomena in Syromastes, one much more in accordance with 

 what has been described in other objects, than that elaborated by 

 Gross. It is hardly necessary to adjoin that such a process as the 

 two maturation rlivisions of one pair of chromosomes being continued 

 over two germinal cycles has no known counterpart in other animals, 

 and so needs the most rigid observational demonstration, 



Gerard (1901) has described for Prosthecerceus and Schockaert (1901) 

 for Thysanozoon a peculiar deep-staining thread within the ovocytes 

 which divides into two, and is said to give rise to the egg centrosomes ; 

 it is for future research to determine whether this structure may have 

 any relation to the heterochromosomes.

 perfect agreement in botli ovogenesis and spermatogenesis. Miss Wallace finds 

 that the accessory chromosomes do not divide in either maturation mitosis; 

 and believes that only that fourth of the spermatids which receives them become 

 functional spermatozoa, so that the remaining three-fourths "are regarded as 

 homologous to the polar bodies thrown off by the ovum."

The Utility Principle in Relation to Specific Characters. — Mr. 

 Arthur Erwin Brown made a communication of which the follow- 

 ing is an abstract: 



By way of introduction to an argument supporting a broad view of 

 the factors of evolution, such as that taken by Darmn, against the 

 exclusive valuation of Natural Selection urged by Neo-Darwinians, 

 the speaker mentioned that Charles Darwin was elected a corre- 

 spondent of the Academy on March 27, 1860, the Origin of Species 

 having been first published in London on November 24, 1859, and 

 the following extract was read from a letter written by Darwin on 

 May 8, 1860, to Sir Charles Lyell: "This morning I got a letter from 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia announcing that I 

 am elected a correspondent. It shows that some naturalists there 

 do not think I am such a scientific profligate as many think me here." 



The Academy appears to have been the first among scientific socie- 

 ties to confer its honors upon Darwin after the publication of his 

 immortal work. 



The opinion of Alfred Russell Wallace as a leading advocate of Neo- 

 Darwinism, that utility has necessarily been the sole factor in the pro- 

 duction of specific characters, was contrasted with Darwin's view, and 

 the difficulty of bringing facts to bear against a logical proposition 

 constructed in the form of a closed circle was pointed out. Many biol- 

 ogists have been led by this difficulty to the hasty conclusion that it is 

 useless to cite cases of apparent inutility in face of it ; but this view is 

 unfortunate, for thereby the field is abandoned to the advocates of 

 exclusive utihty. Furthermore, the accumulation of probabilities by 

 means of such cases is not only legitimate as a method, but at the pres- 

 ent time is about the only one by which the argument can be met. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 207 



An examination of the evidence for utility in generic and specific 

 characters in serpents was undertaken, chiefly for the reason that the 

 relative simplicity of their organization and the nature of the charac- 

 ters which meet with general acceptance as of taxonomic value seemed 

 likely to afford exceptions to Mr. Wallace's law. The result appears to 

 be that if the validity of specific characters depends solely upon utility, 

 species are few, many genera now including a number of accepted 

 species which Mr. Wallace would be logically bound to reduce to one. 

 Profound structural differences below family rank are not known among 

 snakes. Generic determination is made upon associations of charac- 

 ters, such as the presence or absence of hypapophyses on the posterior 

 trunk vertebrae with endlessly varying details in the form, number and 

 serial proportion of teeth, the arrangement or absence of certain head 

 plates, and differences in the scutellation upon the body. Utility is 

 evident in the presence of ventral hypapophyses, for they supply at- 

 tachment for bundles of muscular fibres running to the diapophyses 

 of several succeeding vertebra, which play an important part in throw- 

 ing the body into curves. They are found in most aquatic species 

 except in Hydroyhince, where they are largely developed upon the tail. 

 But they are present in groups as widely separated otherwise as the 

 so-called Natricince among colubrine snakes, the Elapinoe among pro- 

 teroglyphs, and in Viperidoe. They are, therefore, of no value, taken 

 separately, as measures of affinity. The elapine and viperine snakes 

 are not usually aquatic, and in them utility has doubtless had relation 

 to the rapidity and force required in striking and the need of firm sup- 

 port for the hinder part of the body during the act. In fact, the distri- 

 bution of these structures seems to afford a true case of convergent 

 evolution. 



While utility was primarily concerned in the development of teeth 

 generally, it does not follow that the endless trifling differences in 

 the teeth of Colubridce and Boidce are due to the same cause, 

 for they do not present distinctive types, as in mammals and many 

 lizards, having a mechanical relation to kind of food, but seem, on the 

 whole, to be promiscuously distributed. That such minute differences 

 are due to internal laws of growth and are reached by Natural Selection 

 only when they become hurtful, is much more intelligible than that 

 utility has required such endless variety of minute adaptations. It is 

 admitted that by referring a structure to "laws of growth" no more is 

 accomplished than to express a belief in the action of organic causes 

 whose exact nature is not yet known. 



In head plates the differences commonly met with are in the absence 

 or fusion of certain ones upon the snout. That the presence or ab- 

 sence of a minute fissure between any of these plates, which are under- 

 laid by the bony skull and incapable of flexure, can have selective value 

 is inconceivable, and the frequency of their occurrence in degraded, 

 burrowing species points clearly to the probability that they result 

 from the direct action of external stimuli and are of too little import- 

 ance to be acted upon by Natural Selection. In fact, the almost 

 invariable occurrence of these anomalies in burrowing species is a 




208 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



powerful argument for the agency of external irritations as a cause of 

 change in structure, and the further fact that they have become perma- 

 nent in such genera as Stilosoma, Helicops, Haldea, Abastor, Carphophis 

 and others, certainly indicates that these degradational characters have 

 been inherited. They cannot be " ontogenetic" modifications, for they 

 are exhibited by the newly born young ; furthermore, it is of the very 

 nature of ontogenetic modifications that they must be adaptive, 

 while the whole biu-den of the present argument is to show that those 

 here in question are not of that character. That the complete absence 

 of internasals or loreal is sometimes correlated with a shortened snout 

 and reduced dentition is true, but this condition is not adaptive but 

 degradational. The result of adaptation in burrowing species is seen in 

 Heterodon, where the bony snout has been lengthened and made 

 stronger instead of being reduced. In response to external irritations 

 this genus of exceptional burrowers has developed an irregular number 

 of supernumerary plates on the snout, instead of suffering any loss. 



The elongation of the rostral, or turning up of it like a plough, is 

 usually regarded as an adaptation related to subterranean habits, and 

 in some cases, as Heterodon and Lystrophis, it is doubtless true, but the 

 elongation reaches a maximum in Dryophis, which is more arboreal than 

 most snakes, and is wholly absent in many others which burrow freely. 



In body scales the range of individual variation in the number of 

 rows follows a general law of proportion to the normal mean. In 

 ColuhridcB, with a minimum of ten and maximum of thirty-five, they 

 rarely vary more than two to six rows, while in Boidce, with extremes 

 of twenty-one and ninety-five, they frequently vary as much as fifteen. 

 Mr. Bateson's law of "meristic" variation seems to be followed. The 

 power of heredity is shown in this relative adherence to a mean, but 

 with the normal range of variation in mind, it cannot be supposed that 

 a slight difference in the number of rows can ever have had selective 

 value to the ancestral form of any species. The fact that the normal 

 number in a species bears a quite definite relation to girth of body, indi- 

 cates that they are determined by laws of growth. This might be 

 regarded as a correlation, under Mr. Wallace's comprehensive defini- 

 tion, but it may be doubted if size, as a general fact in nature, is con- 

 ditioned by Natural Selection. It is more likely to be determined by 

 laws of growth reacting to nutritive supply. 



The function of keels and scale pits is not known. The last are 

 probably vestigial. Keels may serve a purpose in the swimming habit 

 of aquatic species. In Hydrophince, where they are not much devel- 

 oped on the dorsal scales, ventral keels are common. With both struc- 

 tures probable utility may be conceded . 



The use pertaining to an entire or divided anal plate is not evident. 

 It might appear that a divided anal would be of service in increasing 

 extensibility of the parts involved, but in that case it would be a pro- 

 gressive character, and we have, on the contrary, genera with an entire 

 anal, such as Eutcenia and Pityophis, descended from Tropidonotus and 

 Coluber, which have the divided form. It is the case, however, that 

 an entire anal is present in all but two genera of Boidce, which are near 

 the base of the series in phylogeny. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 209 



Specific determination is made chiefly upon color. Some few cases 

 of color in serpents are protective or warning, but very many species 

 in most large genera are marked by differences in pattern or tint so 

 inconspicuous, that in view of the want of keen eyesight in snakes, it 

 does not seem credible that they can serve the ends usually regarded 

 as useful. The range of color variation in many species is extraordi- 

 narily great, and some brilliantly colored species are mainly subter- 

 ranean, both of which facts are inconsistent with the theory of recog- 

 nition markings. Recognition in snakes is probably much more served 

 by the olfactory than by the optic sense. Sexual selection cannot be 

 a cause, for few species are known to present differences characteristic 

 of sex. 



Pigments in reptiles probably result from waste products of meta- 

 bolism, which doubtless is influenced by external conditions and food. 

 It is not, however, the existence of color, but its precise distribution in 

 species which is here in question, and the minuteness of the differences 

 in many cases between species of a genus, or between species belonging 

 to distinct genera but occupying the same range, renders it doubtful 

 if the utility principle can be held to explain them adequately. At the 

 same time the subject is very obscure. 



The opinion held by the extreme Neo-Darwinians is a deduction from 

 the denial of the inheritance of acquired characters urged by the Weiss- 

 man school. It is true that the experimental evidence for such inheri- 

 tance is far from establishing it, but, on the other hand, none but that 

 of negative kind can ever be brought against it, and as a philosophical 

 proposition it has a right to consideration. The further assumption 

 that Natural Selection necessarily requires the disappearance of "indif- 

 ferent" characters which are outside of the law of utility, is unwar- 

 ranted. As far as is now known, inheritance and variation are ulti- 

 mate facts of organic life. Congenital variation occurs within rela- 

 tively narrow limits about a mean, and if it be held that the characters 

 we have been considering have come to be of this kind, so long as they 

 are not injurious but merely "indifferent," no reason can be assigned, 

 aside from the necessity of completing a logical system, why they 

 may not be continued in succeeding generations. 



Natural Selection is too often spoken of as if it were a positive force 

 in evolution. It is not so. The struggle for existence is no more than 

 the trial which conditions success, and Natural Selection does no more 

 than determine the failures by means of their detrimental structures. 

 It cannot directly affect those merely neutral. 



The fact that characters such as the presence of brilliant colors in 

 subterranean species, and the fusions among head plates which there 

 is especially good reason to regard as "indifferent," have become fixed 

 to the point of specific or generic value, directly contradicts Mr. Wal- 

 lace's law of exclusive utility. Their continuance, furthermore, would 

 seem to require explanation under a doctrine of absolute non-inheri- 

 tance of acquired characters.

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, I: Uroooptidae ; Helicidse of 

 Arizona and New Mexico. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



In these papers the molhisks collected by Mr. James H. Ferriss and 

 the writer in the expedition made in 1903 and l)y Mr. Ferriss in two 

 visits to Arizona in 1902 and 1904 will be discussed. The present contri- 

 bution deals chiefly with Mr. Ferriss' researches in Arizona, where an 

 extraordinarily rich and varied snail fauna was found in the canyons of 

 the Chiricahua and Huachuca Mountains. In the study of these mate- 

 rials I have worked over many specimens received from the late E. H. 

 Ashmun, who first made known to us the richness of the Arizona snail 

 fauna, and from Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, whose unceasing labors on 

 the fauna and flora of New Mexico are familiar to all naturalists. The 

 treatment of the genus Ashmunella has been made practically mono- 

 graphic. 



It is unfortunate that no good topographic survey of southern Ari- 

 zona has been published. It is extremely difficult at present to deter- 

 mine some localities given by previous naturalists, or to clearly indi- 

 cate the positions of those explored by Mr. Ferriss. The accompanying 

 sketch of the canyons explored in the Huachucas makes no pretensions 

 to cartographic accuracy beyond showing the relative positions of the 

 localities mentioned in the text. From Fort Huachuca to Ramsey 

 Canyon is 10 miles; to Carr Canyon 14, and to Miller Canyon 20 miles. 

 Manilla mine is 6 miles from Fort Huachuca. The range is about 30 

 miles long and 6 wide. 



Of the Chiricahuas, it may suffice to say that Bar or Bearfoot Park 

 's on the summit, and is believed to lie at 8,500 feet elevation. There 

 was a sawmill there in 1904. From it toward the southwest Sawmill 

 Canyon leads, and Cave creek flows down from the opposite side. 

 This must not be confused with Cave Creek Canyon in the Huachucas. 

 Fly Park, the type locality of Ashmunella chiricahuana, is on the same 

 mountain, farther south about two(?) miles. Cave creek is 30 miles 

 from Nine-Mile Canyon, and 20 miles from Fort Bowie. Mr. Ferriss 

 has given notes on the general conditions of collecting and on the coun- 

 try in the Nautilus for September, 1904. 



Some considerations of general interest to evolutionists are touched

Family UROCOPTIDuE Pils. 



This family is represented in the Southwest by members of two very 

 distinct subfamihes: Eucalodiix>e with the genus Holospira, and 

 MiCROCERAMiN.E with thc genus Microceramus. 



Holospira is an old genus, containing several highly specialized phyla. 

 Our species fall into five groups as indicated below. The subgenera 

 were formerly defined by the internal lamellae alone ; but these are in 

 some cases of less significance than the general form and sculpture, 



A. — Last whorl distorted, its last half turning sinistrally. 



I. — Internal column rather large, smooth throughout; last whorl 

 sinuous, turning sinistrally. Aperture oblong, with a strong 

 fold within the right margin and a vertical columellar cal- 

 lous in the throat. Metastoma Strebel. One species, H. 

 roemeri. 



B. — Last half of the last whorl straightened, normal. 



II. — Internal column small, smooth and simple throughout, or 

 with a small axial lamella in the last whorl ; very slender 

 below, slightly wider above. Shell rather large, 19 to 29 

 mm. long, the individual whorls comparatively high; the 

 last one or tw^o more coarsely sculptured than the inter- 

 mediate ones. Number of whorls much less than the num- 

 ber of millimeters in the length of the shell. Haplocion 

 Pils. Species, H. pasonis Dall, H. hamiltoni Dall. 

 III. — Penultimate whorl with a short, stout lamella on the axis, 

 and a weaker one on the basal wall. Number of whorls 

 decidedly less than the number of millimeters in the shell's 

 length. Distomospira Dall. Species, H. bilamellata Dall. 

 IV. — Internal column moderate, one-fourth to one-sixth the diam- 

 eter of shell. Shell 9 to 18 mm. long in known species, com- 

 pactly coiled, ribbed or striated, the whorls short, their 

 number about equal to the number of millimeters in the 

 length of the shell, or exceeding that number. A short axial 

 lamella is present within the penult, whorl, and sometimes 

 short basal or parietal lamellae. Bostrichocentrum Strebel. 

 Type H. iryoni. 

 V. — Cavity of the penultimate whorl obstructed bj' four strong 

 lamellae, axial, basal, parietal and palatal. Holospira 

 s. sir. Species, H. goldfussi Mke. 



In addition to the species noticed below, the following species of 

 Holospira are known from north of the Mexican boundary: 



H. {Bostrichocentrum) pilsbryi Dall, rather doubtfully recorded from 

 New Mexico or Arizona, without definite locality, and known to inhabit 

 the Mexican state Puebla. 



H. {Distomospira) hilomellata Dall, from the top of Hacheta Grande 

 Mountain, Grant county, New Mexico.

Subgenus HOLOSPIRA (typical group). 



Holospira goldfussi (Menke). PI. XXVI, figs. 1-5. 



I jke H. rocmeri, this species belongs to the hill country bordering the 



Lower Cretaceous area in Texas. Mr. Ferriss and the writer found it 



above San Marcos, Hays county, Texas , in the 

 flood-debris of Sinking Spring, and on ledges 

 of its bordering limestone cliff. This is 

 farther northeast than the species has hith- 

 erto been found, for I have no doubt that 

 the locality "Dallas," cited by Strebel, is 

 an error. It is abundant under stones at 

 the foot of the cliffs along the Guadalupe 

 river, about six miles above New Braun-

The specimens figured are from the Guadalupe. New Braunfels is 

 probably the type locality. 



At the Hondo river, two miles north of Hondo, Medina county, in 

 the drift-debris, we also found H. goldfussi. This is the extreme west- 

 ern range of the species as far as we know. It did not occur in the 

 Devil's river region, on the Pecos or westward. 



Subgenus BOSTRICHOCENTRUM Strebel. 



All of the species have a small, short lamella on the axis in the 

 last part of the penultimate whorl, sometimes almost obsolete, and 

 some of them have a very weak basal or parietal lamella, or both. 

 These lamellae are always very much smaller and lower down than 

 those of typical Holospira {goldfussi, etc.). The variations are as 

 follows :

The shell is rimate but imperforate, short and cylindric, rather thin, 

 and very pale brownish-corneous. Whorls 9^ to 11, the first whorl 

 wider than the second, both of them smooth ; all the rest of the whorls 

 are regularly, evenly and closely rib-striate, the riblets as wide as their

intervals or a little narrower, except on the last whorl, where the sculp- 

 ture is a little coarser and irregular. The whorls are all convex, the 

 last 4 or 5 forming the cylindric portion, the preceding whorls forming 

 the terminal cone, which is about one-third the total length of the shell. 

 The last whorl is pinched or compressed laterally, but the very short 

 straight "neck" is full again, and carries the aperture very shortly 

 free. The aperture is rounded, but a little irregular, the upper margin 

 being somewhat straightened. The thin peristome is narrowly ex- 

 panded. 



The internal pillar is rather large and of ec^ual calibre in the cylindric 

 portion of the shell. At the end of the penultimate and beginning of 

 the last whorl there is a short strong and blunt lamella on the pillar 

 below the middle, a low, short lamella on the parietal wall and another 

 on the basal wall. There is no palatal lamella. 



Length 7.5 to 9, diam. 3 mm. 



Manilla mine, Huachuca Mountains. 



This is a very short, thick-set species, unlike all others known in its 

 internal armature. The even ribbing and short terminal cone are also 

 characteristic. It is closely related to H. arizonensis Stearns, from 

 Dos Cabezas, a place west of the Chiricahua range and not far from one 

 of the localities of H. ferrissi; but besides the slight difference in inter- 

 nal structure, H. arizonensis differs in being slightly larger with more 

 whorls, and the riblets are subobsolete on the cylindric portion of the 

 shell, while in H. ferrissi they are even stronger there than on the ter- 

 minal cone. 



This species occurred also at Fort Bowie, Arizona, where the shells 

 average a trifle larger : 



Length 7.5, diam. 3 mm., whorls 9^. 



Length 10, diam. 3 mm., whorls IH. 



This species seems to partially connect typical Holospira with the 

 sections Eudistemma and Distomospir'a . The lamellse are far shorter 

 and weaker than in the typical section, in fact, might easily be over- 

 looked. 



Holospira arizonensis Stearns. 



This shell is cylindric wdth a short, ribbed, terminal cone. The median 

 whorls are smoother, only obscurely sculptured, and the last whorl is 

 ribbed. Whorls 12 or 13. 



The internal axis is moderately large, and there is a short lamella on 

 the axis and one on the parietal wall or roof in the penultimate whorl. 



Lengtl\12.5 to 13, diam. 4 mm. 



Southeast Arizona, at Dos Cabezas, Cochise county. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 217 



This species resembles H. ferrissi and H. cionella in shape, but differs 

 by its larger size and the obsolete sculpture of the median whorls, as 

 well as by the slightly different internal lamellae. It is known by the 

 original specimens only. 



Holospira cionella u. sp. PI. XXVII, figs. 30-33. 



The shell is very shortly rimate but imperforate, cylindric with a 

 short terminal cone, corneous-white. Whorls 11| to 12^, convex, the 

 first 2^ smooth, second whorl narrow, the first wider and bulging. 

 Subsequent whorls are sharply and closely ribbed throughout. The 

 last whorl is compressed laterally, tapering downward, the base white, 

 rounded and prominent; it is contracted, descends a little, and is 

 shortly free in front. The aperture is very shortly ovate, the peristome 

 thin and narrowly expanded. The axis is moderately large and cylin- 

 dric, with a low, blunt lamella at the end of the penultimate and begin- 

 ning of the last whorl. 



Length 10 to 12, diam. 3 mm. 



Fort Bowie, Cochise county, Arizona. 



The uniform ribbing throughout, the cylindric shape and short ter- 

 minal cone are the prominent features of this species, which groups 

 with H. mearnsi, cockerelli and chiricahuana. 



Holospira crossei Dall. PI. XXVI, fig. 8. 



This species is closely related to H. cockerelli, but differs by its wider 

 shorter form and much shorter terminal cone of the spire. At the end 

 of the penultimate whorl there is a very weak prominence upon the 

 axis near the basal wall, hardly to be called a lamella. The tapering 

 portion of the spire is ribbed, the cylindric portion smoothish.

Holospira regis Pils. and Ckll., n. sp. PI. XXVI, tig. 7. 



Shell small, the lower half cylindric, upper half slowly tapering in a 

 long cone to the obtuse apex. Whorls 12f , all convex, the first two 

 smooth, the following whorls of the tapering portion of the spire rather 

 strongly, obliquely rib-striate, the riblets slightly narrower than their 

 interstices; the penultimate and next earlier whorls are more closely 

 and a little more finely sculptured, but on the last whorl the riblets 

 become stronger again. The last half of the last whorl is compressed 

 laterally, sloping to an almost subangulate but very obtuse base. 

 Near the end the whorl becomes free, descends a little, and is flattened 

 and excavated above. The aperture is obliquely piriform, its contour 

 being compressed near the upper outer angle. The peristome is free 

 throughout, expanded, the columellar and upper margins a little re- 

 flexed. The upper margin is a little dilated inwardly. The axis is 

 small and slender. Near the end of the penultimate whorl there is 

 a short, stout lamella on the axis near the basal wall.

Near Kingston, Sierra county, New Mexico. Type No. 87,208,

This species is about the size of H. chiricahuana , which, however, 

 differs in the less projecting last whorl, contracted behind the lip, and 

 in the smaller, differently shaped mouth. The more closely related H. 

 mearnsi is larger with more whorls, but it is not unlikely that specimens 

 intermediate in these respects will be found. Several broken shells of 

 H. regis indicate dimensions smaller than those of the type. 



Holospira cockerelli Dall. PI. XXVI, fig. 6. 



Holospira (Haplosiemma) cockerelli Dall, Nautilus, XI, p. 61, October, 1897. 

 Shell cylindric below, the upper half tapering in a long, very slowly 

 tapering cone to the obtuse apex. Whorls 13f , convex, the upper ones 

 more so. The first 2h form the smooth embryonic shell, the second of 

 them being wider and more swollen than the following one. Post-em- 

 bryonic whorls of the tapering spire rather strongly rib-striate, the rib- 

 lets oblique, narrower than the rather wide intervals. On the cylindric 

 portion the riblets weaken to irregular growth wrinkles, but the base 

 and the last half of the last whorl are strongly ribbed again. The last 

 whorl is well rounded below, projects forward but very shortly, and 

 descends to the mouth. The aperture is obliquely rounded-piriform, 

 produced at the upper outer angle. Lip well expanded, the columellar 

 and upper margins narrowly rcflexed. The axis is slender. There is 

 a low weak lamella on the axis in the last part of the penultimate whorl, 

 close to the basal wall .

The type was found in the debris of the Rio Grande at Mesilla, New- 

 Mexico. The specimen described above is from near Kingston, Sierra 

 county, New Mexico, collected by 0. B. Metcalfe, sent by Prof. T. D. A. 

 Cockerell. 



H. cockerelli differs from the related H. regis and H. mearnsi chiefly 

 by the smoothness of the intermediate whorls. It is not improbable 

 that the original specimen found in the flood-debris of the Rio Grande 

 was washed down from the region around Kingston, as Prof. Cockerell 

 suggests to me. 



Holospira chiricahuana "• sp. PI. XXVI, fig. 9 ; PI. XXVII, figs. 2&-29. 



Shell imperforate, shortly rimate, cylindric, the upper half tapering, 

 thin, pale brownish-corneous. Whorls 11 to 12, all convex, the first 

 slightly bulging and wider than the second, both smooth, the following 

 whorls sharply sculptured with close riblets a little narrower than their 

 intervals. The last whorl is compressed laterally, tapering downward, 

 the base prominent and white. It is very shortly straightened and a 

 little contracted in front, not carrying the aperture in front of the ven- 

 tral plane of the shell, though the peristome is very shortly free. The 

 aperture is shortly ovate, nearly round, the peristome very narrowly 

 expanded. 



The axis is moderately large and of nearly equal calibre throughout, 

 and at the end of the penultimate and beginning of the last whorl there 

 is a low, short obtuse lamella below the middle on the axis.

H. mearnsi Dall is a larger and smoother species. In H. cockerelli 

 the sculpture is coarse on the early and last whorls only, the middle 

 ones having a polished or at least smoothish surface with quite faint 

 striation only. The spire in H. chiricahuana tapers more gradually 

 than in most other species. 



Some of the specimens from Fort Bowie are larger, length 13, diam. 

 3.25 mm.; whorls 14; and one from Cave Creek Canyon, the type

 are strong and uniform throughout in all the specimens.

This peculiar snail Inhabits the hilly border of the 1,000 foot elevation 

 which roughly defines the southeastern limit of the Lower Cretaceous 

 area in Texas, It has not been observed northeast of New Braunfels. 

 Thence it has been traced westward in Medina county, and near the 

 Rio Grande, at Devil's river and the Pecos. We know nothino; of its 

 distribution northward upon the ''Edwards Plateau," since only its 

 lower scarps have been explored. Westward we have it from El Paso, 

 where Ferriss got specimens on Franklin Mountain in 1902; and in 

 New Mexico Rehn and Viereck found it in Alamo Canyon, near Alamo- 

 gorda, Otero county, in the eastern range of the Cordillera. 



The specimens from El Paso are large, like those of the Pecos. An 

 average one measures, length 15.5, diam. 4.5 mm.; whorls 14. Those 

 from Alamo Canyon are smaller, 12 to 13 mm. long, 4 wide. They 

 vary but little in size. 



In the canyon of the Pecos river, in Valverde county, Texas, above 

 and below the High Bridge (figs. 16, 17, 18), the specimens are larger 

 than at any other locality, and have more whorls for their length. The 

 base is narrowly and deeply excavated, and the last whorl is very 

 strongly sigmoid and projects in a longer neck than in the shells of 

 central Texas. Most of the shells measure 15 to 16 mm. long, 4 wide, 

 few being larger or smaller.

 11 to 12 mm. long, and the diameter is generally less than 4 mm. A 

 large proportion of the shells have "overhanging" upper whorls. 

 They were picked out of river-debris, and probably came from the hill 

 country some miles farther north. The measurements of fifty adult

Microcermnus comprises the species formerly referred to Macro- 

 ceramus in works on snails of the United States. These, with their 

 Antillean relatives, prove to have no near relationship to true Macro- 

 ceramus, which belongs to a different subfamily, the Urocoptince, very 

 unlike the Microceramince in dentition. 

 Microceramus texanus (Pils.). PI. XXVI, figs. 19-21. 



A species of the hill country inhabited by Holospira goldfussi, with 

 which it is found. It was originally described from New Braunfels, 

 Comal county, but the range has been extended both north and south 

 by Mr. Ferriss and myself. vSpecim^ens were taken in the drift of the 

 Hondo river, two miles north of Hondo, Medina county; in Comal coun- 

 ty, on the rocky, wooded hillside above the head fountains of Comal 

 creek, near New Braunfels, and along the Guadalupe river, some 

 miles above (figs. 19-21). These last are the largest and best developed 

 shells, but vary in size :

M. texanus is closely related to M. mexicanus (v. Mart.), a species 

 extending from the State of Vera Cruz to Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, 

 and to M. floridanus of Florida. The areas of the three are now widely 

 separated.

The first three of these, though degenerate in their reproductive 

 organs, are believed to belong to the Belogona euadenia of my classifi- 

 cation of Helices, and are therefore more nearly related to the Califor- 

 nian and ^lexican Helices than to those of eastern North America. 



Thysanophora is represented by two species, noticed below.

 the branches of the genitalia. Penis retractor muscle with a very long

 on the lung-floor. Jaw ribbed. Teeth of the ordinary Helicid type, 

 about 10 on each side being laterals. 



Type A. rhyssa 7niorhyssa. All known species are from the moun- 

 tains of New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. 



Only two of the 15 species and 10 subspecies now known had been 

 recognized prior to 1895, and but one of these was published at the time 

 the last treatise on American land snails was issued, Binney's Manual 

 of American Land Shells, 1885. The literature of the group is scattered 

 through many volumes of several periodicals, and a large majority of 

 the species have not been figured. In making substantial additions to 

 the group, it seems timely to review and systematize the data accumu- 

 lated. 



The soft anatomy has proved to conform closely to the generic char- 

 acters originally set forth. Ten species and varieties have now been 

 dissected by myself and one additional by Mr. Murdoch, none of them 

 diverging in any important respect. The proportions of the organs 

 vary in the several forms, showing specific variation and affording valu- 

 able cliies to the affinities of the species. To utilize these data it is 

 necessary to give the measurements of the organs, readily obtained by 

 pulling them out straight.' The measurements of the genitalia of 

 ten species of Ashmunella follow : 



* The comparative lengths of the organs are not materially altered by different 

 degrees of contraction owing to different methods of preservation ; and even the 

 absolute dimensions are less affected than might be supposed. All but one of 

 the dissections noticed herein were made from drowned specimens preserved in 

 alcohol, with but little contraction.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mch.,

1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 225 



The jaw and teeth of Ashmunella do not differ from those organs in 

 Sonorella. The jaw is ribbed, the ribs variable and irregular, as is often 

 the case in the Californian Helices. It is less strong and the ribs are 

 less convex than usual in the jaw of Polygyra. The radula has from 

 24.1.24 to about 30.1.30 teeth. There are 9 to 12 lateral teeth. In 

 nine of the ten species examined, both mesocone and ectocone are bifid 

 on part of the marginal teeth. In A. duplicidens and A. chiricahuana 

 the ectocone is usually simple, but on occasional outer marginals of 

 the latter they are bifid, as in the other species. The number of teeth 

 reckoned as laterals varies somewhat on different parts of the same 

 radula, as I have observed in several species; so that the importance 

 of variations from the counts of teeth given in the text must not be 

 overestimated. Except in the case of A. chiricahuana, all of my prepa- 

 rations of genitalia, jaws and radulse are from specimens of the type 

 lots. 



From the data now in hand, it seems in a high degree likely that the 

 ancestral stock of all known Ashmunellas had a tridentate aperture. 

 There was a tendency to split the basal tooth, perhaps not expressed 

 in the original stock, but subsequently developed orthogenetically in 

 most of the subgroups. This tendency culminates in the levettei group, 

 where the original basal tooth has been divided into two distinct and 

 often widely separated teeth. There has also been degeneration of the 

 aperture-teeth, parallel in various stocks, and culminating in several 

 toothless forms, astonishingly alike, though of undoubtedly diverse 

 parentage. A. hyporhyssa Ckll., robusta Pils., chiricahuana Dall, esuri- 

 tor Pils., etc., are convergent forms of this character. The true rela- 

 tionships of such simplified species must be demonstrated by their 

 internal anatomy. The idea that the toothless forms are primitive can 

 hardly be entertained in view of their anatomical diversity and their 

 demonstrable relation to several groups of toothed species, the evi- 

 dently homologous teeth of wnich, on this hypothesis, would have 

 been independently evolved. This would be homoplasy on too 

 extensive a scale to be readily believed. 



The aperture-teeth in Ashmunella curiously imitate those of Polygyra, 

 a genus not in the least related. In Europe, Isognomostoma and Heli- 

 codonta have evolved similar forms in still other phyla. 



There has been a tendency to overload Ashmunella with subspecific 

 names, which would logically end in naming every colony in existence. 

 I do not minimize the importance of noting and recording local diiTeren- 

 tiation. My appreciation of its omnipresence convinces me that it 

 cannot all be stereotyped in nomenclature, and if it were, the result 

 would be too unwieldy for any human intellect to make use of.

226 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mcll., 



The range of individual variation in Ashmtinella among specimens 

 from one place is (with the exception of A. I. heterodonta) not greater 

 than in Polygyra. Among specimens I have measured or examined, 

 I have seen no lot which would yield a markedly bimodal curve were 

 the variations plotted. The variations between different colonies or 

 ■gens are often appreciable, sometimes conspicuous; but here also the 

 €ase may readily be paralleled in Polygyra, although usually not in 

 such restricted areas, for the reason that in the Polygyra country the 

 topographic and climatic features are less emphatic, and the life-zones 

 are not crowded upon one another as in the land of the Ashmunellas, 

 but are spread over larger areas. 



The conception of species in such sedentary animals as snails is far 

 from simple. A "species" comprises a multitude of colonies or com- 

 munities w^hich at any one time are isolated one from the other by the 

 existing topographic and other surface features of the country. This 

 is and always has been the case, even with the common, widespread 

 forms of the more level parts of the country; but the colonies there have 

 always been subject to frequent mixture with their neighboring colo- 

 nies, by the ever slightly fluctuating conditions of woodland and local 

 moisture, so that their network over the country has been here and 

 there made practically complete within comparatively short periods. 

 As a consequence, we have in many cases no tangible difference 

 between individuals from colonies hinidreds of miles apart. 



In regions where the local physical features are more accentuated, 

 the colonies or communities are often less subject to mixtiu-e. More- 

 over, the range of conditions within a limited area is far greater. Thus 

 snails of the same original stock living in the rocky talus on opposite 

 sides of a canyon are often subject to very diverse conditions of heat, 

 moisture and consequently cryptogamic food. They are often wholly 

 unable to cross from one side to the other by reason of a wide, freshet- 

 swept or arid space. Moreover, subsequent changes, such as the for- 

 mation of lateral canyons and the localization of suitable stations in 

 the talus, tend to further isolate the several colonies, and to preserve 

 their individuality for long periods. 



Thus each colony follows its own bent; and differentiation ensues, 

 cither by the cmnulation of organic changes induced by varying 

 conditions of growth and nutrition, determined by the local 

 enviromncnt as mentioned above, or by the occurrence of diverse 

 "mutations " in the several colonies, or by both causes. My idea of the 

 practical isolation of snail colonies is based upon the experience of 

 many years. Similar views have been expressed by Hemphill, in the 




1905.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



227 



account of his collecting in Utah, and by Ferriss, who in speaking of the 

 Huachiicas says, "Every colony in the canyon was liable to have some 



distinctive mark in size, color or form No two colonies seemed 



exactly alike, and they did not visit back and forth, nor travel far from 

 the best part of their own rock pile" {Nautilus, XVIII, p. 51). 



When through some means two slightly differentiated colonies inter- 

 mingle, as they occasionally must, hybridism follows, and a complex 

 progeny issues, such as I have found in the Floridian Liguus. WTio 

 can unravel the tangled threads of affinity when the modified forms of 

 two or more canyons reach each other across a divide ! It is as complex 

 as a modern human commimity, where subraces are mingling blood 

 after centuries of pure breeding. 



Growp of A. rhyssa. 



In species of this group, small basal and parietal teeth are often 

 present, but there is no outer lip tooth. The spermatheca and its duct 

 are about half the length of the penis, epiphallus and flagellum, or even 

 less. The combined length of the penis, epiphallus and flagellum is 

 decidedly less than three times the diameter of the shell. The penis 

 is comparatively well developed. 



This group is especially characteristic of the Capitan, White and 

 Sacramento ranges of southern-central New Mexico, east of the Rio 

 Grande. The forms now known arrange themselves in three series, 

 thus : 



robusta 



ashmuni 



capitanensis hyporhyssa altissima 



pseudodonta 



miorhyssa- 



-rhyssa- 



-townsendi 



The central and right-hand groups are known to be related by the 

 genitalia. The group on the left is separated from these geographically, 

 and its relationships must remain wholly uncertain until the soft parts 

 can be examined.

This is the senior name for a member of the group of closely related 

 forms inhabiting the Sierra Blanca and adjoining Sacramento Moun- 

 tains, in middle-southern New Mexico. 



The shell is more globose than any other known Ashmunella, having 

 about the proportions of the large Eastern Mesodons. It is dull and 

 roughly sculptured on the last whorl with coarse, curved irregular 

 wrinkles, between and over which fine incised spirals may be traced. 

 The rather small aperture is contracted by a wide, heavy lip, the outer 

 margin of which is indistinctly thickened within. There is a low, in- 

 distinct basal tooth or callous, and a very small, deeply placed, oblique 

 parietal tooth, sometimes absent. The innbilicus is narrow and deep, 

 but slightly enlarging at the last whorl. Whorls 5-^-.

"Like rhyssa in size and form, but umbilicus wider, exposing the 

 penultimate whorl ; sculpture finer, consisting of striae rather than 

 riblets. One specimen, diam. max. 15, min. 12f , alt. 9 mm." 



Lower slopes of Sierra Blanca, New Mexico, above head of Ruidoso 

 creek, in aspen belt, about 9,500 feet altitude. (Prof. C. H. T. Town- 

 send, August 14, 1898.) 



The original description is given above. The unique type specimen 

 was lost. Prof. Cockerell subsequently described what seems to be the 

 same race, or one excessively similar, as A. hyporhyssa edentatn, with 

 mutations rufescens and alba, from Cloudcroft, Sacramento Mountains. 

 In the absence of any differential feature in the description or measure- 



ments, I assume that the Cloudcroft shells are identical with 

 hyporhyssa. 



A somewhat large series was collected by Mr. H. L. Viereck in James 

 Canyon, at Cloudcroft, Sacramento Mountains, at an elevation of 9,500 

 feet. Two lots were taken, one of a few large specimens (PI, XII, 

 figs. 7, 8), the other of many smaller ones. Compared with A. rhyssa 

 the shells differ in the constantly more depressed last whorl, though the 

 spire may be equally high; the umbilicus is wider at its opening, ex- 

 posing more of the penultimate whorl; the basal tooth is obsolete or 

 very weak, and the parietal tooth is present only as an extremely 

 small vestige in less than 5 per cent, of the specimens. Finally, the 




230 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



sculpture is less strong except just behind the lip, where the wrinkles 

 generally are emphatic. 



The lot of smaller specimens (PI. XII, figs. 9-13) consisted of about 

 300 shells. 200 fully adult specimens were measured. The diameter 

 varies between 13 and 17 mm., and gives the curve plotted on p. 229. 

 The major mode is at 15 mm., 43 per cent, of the lot being within .2 

 mm. of that dimension. There is a minor mode at 14 mm.; but the 

 lot is remarkably homogeneous, since over 80 per cent, are between 

 13.8 and 15.2 mm. diameter. 



The altitude bears no constant ratio to the diameter. It is individu- 

 ally variable within wide limits. In the first 50 individuals of 15 mm. 

 diameter (from my schedule of measurements of 200 specimens of all 

 sizes) the following dimensions were found : 



It will be noticed that the mode is at 9 mm., 30% of the whole num- 

 ber having that altitude, while the number of more depressed individ- 

 uals is as nearly as possible equal to the number more elevated. Speci- 

 mens of the same lot, of other diameters, give altitude curves of the 

 same symmetrical form, and need not here be detailed. 



There are 5 albinos in the 200 shells measured, though an uninter- 

 rupted series from albinos to the darkest brown specimens makes a 

 selection difficult. 



Nine shells in 200 show a ver}^ small parietal tooth, one being shown 

 in fig. 12. 



The other lot, of larger shells (PI. 12, figs. 7, 8), contains 2 albinos 

 out of 14 shells. None has a parietal tooth. The measurements 

 follow : 



A small series from Cloudcroft, 8,750 feet, collected by E. O. Wooton, 

 received from Prof. Cockerell, contains also large and small examples,

the diameters beins;, large, 18.5, 18, 17.3, 17, 16.2, and small, 15, 15 

 mm. These are part of Prof. Cockerell's original lot of A. h. edentata. 



At Highrolls, in the Sacramento Mountains, at 6,500 feet elevation, 

 Mr. Viereck obtained three specimens, 17.2, 17 and 16.8 mm. diam. 

 They have the umbilicus a trifle narrower than in the larger Cloud- 

 croft shells. 



Tn Alamo Canyon, 14 miles from Alamogorda, Mr. Ferriss picked up a 

 few dead specimens. The imibilicus is decidedly narrower than in the 

 Cloud croft shells. One of five examined has a vestigial parietal tooth.

A. rhyssa commonly varies from less than 15 to 17 mm. in diameter, 



and from 8 to over 10 mm. alt., so that the present form falls within 



its range of size. The coarser sculpture of "many strong sublamellar 



axial ribs" seems to be its chief or only distinguishing character. It 



stands, apparently, between rhyssa and aUissima.

 striffi set in which gradually become coarser. On the last whorl they 

 become strong, rounded sigmoid ribs, very strong on the last half whorl. 

 There are traces of fine spiral lines between the ribs. Behind the lip 

 the whorl is moderately contracted, and it descends a trifle to the aper- 

 ture. The aperture is very oblique, lunate. The peristome is thick- 

 ened within and on its convex face, narrowly reflexed throughout.

There is a faint, hardly noticeable basal prominence, but nothing to 

 be called a tooth. There is no parietal tooth, and the callous between 

 the lip-ends is very thin.

This species differs from those of the Sierra Blanca chiefly by its more 

 depressed shape and the bifid basal callous, which is split into two low 

 denticles like some of the subspecies of ,4. thomsoniana. The compara- 

 tively short duct of the spermatheca shows A. pseudodonta to be much 

 more closely related to A. rhyssa than to A. thomsoniana. Five speci-

 The shell is depressed, glossy, brown, with weak irregular growth- 

 wrinkles and fine, close incised spirals. The spire is very low conic, 

 Wliorls 5^, quite convex, the last wide, rounded peripherally, swollen 

 above behind the deep constriction behind the lip. The aperture is 

 quite oblique, the lip either brown-tinted throughout or white. Within 

 the basal margin there is a loir, very iccakly bifid callous, often hardly 

 noticeable. There is a very small parietal tooth in four out of six 

 specimens examined. The umbilicus is small and deep within, enlarg- 

 ing at the last whorl, rather broadly exposing the pemdtimate whorl.

This form is at present well separated from pseudodonla by the uni- 

 formly much larger size. The basal teeth arc also less developed, and 

 the lip comparatively narrower. It is to pseudodonta as rohusta is to 

 ashmuni. It has reached about the same stage of evolution as A . hypo- 

 rhyssa, A. a. rohusta and A. chiricahuana. In the lot of 100 specimens 

 taken by Mr. Ashmun there is one pale greenish-corneous albino.

This species is small, much like A. pseudodonta, but there is scarcely 

 the trace of a basal tooth. The outer lip is well thickened within, and 

 there is no parietal tooth.' The usual wrinkle-like growth-lines are 

 present, but spiral lines are very faint, not discernible in some speci- 

 mens. Five of the original lot measure:

The shell is similar in size and general contour to A. p. capitanensis; 



chestnut or greenish-chestnut colored, glossy, sculptured with low, 



irregular growth- wrinkles which are strongest below the suture, and 



weaker on the base, and very fine incised spirals, close and numerous 



but very lightly impressed. The spire is very low conoid. WTiorls 



5^, convex, the last about double the width of the preceding, its last 



third decidedly swollen, inflated behind the deep constriction back of 



the lip. The aperture is roundly lunate, without teeth. The lip is 



coffee-tinted, rather narrowly re flexed, convex on the face, and a little 



thickened inwardly within the outer margin. There is no parietal 



tooth. The umbilicus is cylindric within and deep, rather broadly 



expanding at the last whorl, exposing the penultimate whorl.

This form has hitherto been referred to A. chiricahuana , from which 

 it differs chiefly in the greater inflation of the latter part of the last whorl. 

 This is noticeable in a side view, and is seen prominently above the 

 aperture in a front view. It differs from A. pseudodonta capitanensis 

 chiefly by wanting basal teeth. 



In such simplified forms as this, it is not easy to determine the true 

 relationships by the shell alone. When the genitalia can be examined 

 the affinities of A. ashmuni and A. a. robusta. wnll doubtless become 

 clear. There is an albino in Mr. Ashmun's collection. 



Group of A. thomsoniana. 



Aperture of the shell with parietal, outer and basal teeth, the latter 

 often bifid, divided into two contiguous tubercles. Length of the sper- 

 matheca and its duct 60 to 65 per cent, that of the penis, epiphallus 

 and flagellum in known forms. 



These forms are from northern central New Mexico. They have been 

 investigated chiefly by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell and his pupils. 



By their genitalia and shells they are related to the southeastern 

 Arizona group. Three forms are perhaps sufficiently differentiated to 

 require names: A. t. porterce, A. thomsoniana and A. t. pecosensis.

In all the forms referred to A. thomsoniana and its subspecies no dis- 

 tinct internal lip-rib is formed when a resting-stage occurred in the 

 neanic period. Such growth-arrests are often indicated by a darker 

 streak on the penultimate or beginning of the last whorl, but the shell 

 is very rarely thickened within by a white callous, and when present, 

 the callous is very thin. 



Distribution: Santa Fe Canyon (Thomson, Ashmun, CklL); Las 

 Vegas and Las Vegas Hot Springs (Miss Cooper, Prof. CklL); Canyon 

 Diablo, near Rowe (Mary Cooper) ; Old Pecos Pueblo, near Valle ranch, 

 Pecos (W. C. CklL). 



The form from Las Vegas Hot Springs, at about 7,000 feet elevation, 

 called A. t. cooperce, offers no tangible difference from Santa Fe thom- 

 soniana. It is not yet evolved enough to be distinguishable from 

 thomsoniana if the specimens were mixed. I do not think it desirable 

 or practicable to name forms so very slightly differentiated. The 

 umbilicus is a trifle more open than typical A. thomsoniana, like the 

 Monument Rock shells or a little less open, being thus intermediate in 

 size. The teeth are in the average slightly smaller. The basal tooth 

 is quite feebly doubled in a minority of the shells seen, simple, small 

 and tubercular in the others. The spire is, in the average, a trifle 

 higher than in Santa Fe thomsoniana (PL XIII, figs. 31-34, the last a 

 co-type of A. t. cooperce). 



A. antiqua CklL and Coop., from the Pleistocene at Las Vegas, New 

 Mexico, is like the shells from Las Vegas Hot Springs noted above in 

 size, but the basal tooth is a low, wide callous, slightly emarginate but 

 not distinctly bifid. The rather heavy teeth and small umbilicus are 

 like typical thomsoniana. A co-type measures 13.2 mm. diam. The 

 parietal callous has scaled off, carrying the tooth with it. I see no 

 valid reason for believing that it represents a divergent branch of 

 thomsoniana. Such characters as this are merely individual.

Miss Mary Cooper collected specimens in I\Ianzanares Valley, near 

 Rowe, New Mexico, which have been reported on b}' Prof. Cockerell 

 and Miss Cooper {Nautilus, XV, p. 109). They are in all respects like 

 those of the type locality except that the inner basal denticle is more 

 obsolete, as in fig. 39. The curve of diameters is the same as in the 

 Beulah lot. The specimens I have seen are from 15 to 16 mm. diam. 



A single specimen I have seen from Cooper's Mill, near Rowe, New 

 Mexico, measures 8.7 x 16 mm., with 5| whorls. The inner basal den- 

 ticle is low, as in Manzanarcs shells. 



The shells from Pecos, New Mexico (PI. XIII, figs. 43-45, collected 

 by Cockerell), are intermediate between thomsoniana and poiierce; the 

 size being that of the former, while in 14 out of 17 specimeiLS before 

 me the basal tooth is double, as in porferce. In the others it is simple, 

 as in thomsoniana. The umbilicus is rather wide, as in porterce. Prof. 

 Cockerell refers the form to A. t. coopera;. Its location depends upon 

 whether size is more important than the teeth as an index of 

 affinity; but the question of name is of minor importance in view of 

 the intergradation of the whole series. Specimens measure : 



There is practically no variation in number of whorls, or in the pro- 

 portion of altitude to diameter. The variation in diameter is not great, 

 but serves to connect thomsoniana and porterce, but the skew of the 

 curve is toward the larger size of porterce.

Some specimens of A. thomsoniana from Las Vegas Hot Springs are 

 almost as strongly wrinkled or costulatc. The subspecies cannot, there- 

 fore, be considered to be strongly differentiated. 



Group of A. levettei. 



The aperture has four teeth, but sometimes the two basal teeth are 

 contiguous, partially united. The length of the spermatheca and its 

 duct is from 55 to 73 per cent, of that of the penis, epiphallus and fla- 

 gellum in known forms. 



This somewhat heterogeneous group is characteristic of southwestern 

 New Mexico and southeastern Arizona. Here are grouped about ten 

 species and subspecies, some of them exceedingly specialized.

This is a form of ample proportions, rich dark chestnut color and 

 glossy surface. The periphery is rounded, or has a mere trace of angu- 

 lation in front. The cylindric umbilicus enlarges rapidly at the last 

 whorl. The spire, while compactly convoluted, has more rapidly 

 widening whorls than A. I. angigyra. The spaces between the three 

 lip-teeth are about equal. The parietal lamella has a "kink" or in- 

 ward bend at the axial end in the type specimen, but this kink is often 

 wanting, being a variable character in levettei and allied species. 

 There are about 6^ whorls, all convex. The first 1^ are smooth and 

 glossy except for short strise radiating from the suture ; on the second 

 whorl these striae extend across the whorl. The following whorls are 

 very finely, irregularly marked with faint growth-lines. On the penul- 

 timate and last whorls there is a faint, excessively fine and close spiral 

 striation, too minute to be visible except witn a compound microscope; 

 and a fine malleation in spiral direction, or spiral impressed lines, 

 readily seen with the hand lens or even the naked eye. The periphery 

 is rounded. Bland's type measured, alt. 6.5, diam. 16 mm.; aperture, 

 including peristome, 7x8 mm., according to the original description. 

 Bland evidently measured the altitude of the axis, not of the whole 

 shell to the base of the lip. His type, which I have examined, agrees 

 with the shells Mr. Ferriss found in Bear and Miller Canyons, in the 

 Huachucas. Figs. 72-75 represent shells from Bear Canyon, agreeing 

 with type specimen in all respects.

Huachiica ^lountains, Cochise county, Arizona, in Bear, Miller 

 and Carr Canyons (James H. Ferriss). It has been reported also from 

 near Tucson, Arizona (Cox). I have seen no specimens from that 

 place. 



Bland originally described levettei as from Santa Fe Canyon, New 

 Mexico, but the researches there of Ashmun, Cockcrell and others have 

 failed to bring it to light. Indeed, no closely related species is known 

 to occur within hundreds of miles of that place, whereas some of the 

 Huachuca shells agree perfectly with the type specimen of levettei 

 which I have examined. Tnere can be little doubt that Dr. Levettc 

 was mistaken in the locality. It is not known that he collected the 

 shells himself. They may have been given him by some army officer 

 who had served in the Southwest. There is, according to Mr. C. R. 

 Biedermann, a Santa Fe Canyon in the San Jose mountains, just south 

 of the Huachuca range, in Mexico.

The lip is either brown or nearly white. Mr. Ferriss' largest speci- 

 men from Bear Canyon measures 8 x 18 mm. 



Fig. 76 represents a beautiful albino found at the head of Bear 

 Canyon, on the southwest side of the Huachuca range, at about 7,000 

 feet elevation. It is bluish white under a very thin caducious pale 

 yellowish cuticle. 



A pathologic specimen from the same place (fig. 77) has suffered 

 extensive breakage at the aperture, A new peristome has been formed 

 and three of the teeth regenerated, typical in shape and position. The 

 inner basal tooth, however, is only feebly represented by a low callous. 



The shells from Miller Canyon, on the north side of the Huachucas 

 (PL XIII, fig. 78), are intermediate between the Bear Canyon levettei 

 and the slightly different race from Carr Canyon, perhaps nearer the 

 latter. They measure from alt. 8.5, diam. 16.3, aperture 7.8 mm. to 

 alt. 7.5, diam. 14, aperture 6.3 mm. 



In Carr Canyon, about four miles farther eastward, at about 5,000 

 feet elevation, a form was found resembling angigyra in its close-coiled 

 whorls and small aperture, but differing in being usually larger, hardly 

 angular, with a larger umbilicus and deeper constriction back of the

 deeper constriction. Specimens measure:

This form is about intermediate between levcttei and angigyra, but 

 it has some slight special characters of its own. They seem hardly 

 sufficient to require that it be named. See PI. XV, figs. 92, 93. 



Ashmunella levettei angigyra n. subsp. PI. XIV, figs. 47-51. 



The shell is brown, smaller and more depressed than levettei obtusely 

 but distinctly angular at the periphery. The surface of the post- 

 embryonic whorls is smoothish, under the lens seen to be very closely, 

 irregularly marked with minute growth-lines, giving it a silky lu-^ter, 

 and the last whorl is often finely malleate spirally, as in vl. levettei. 

 Whorls 6^ to 7, very closely coiled and slowly widening, all of them 

 Comdex above. The suture descends rather abruptly to the aperture. 

 Behind the outer and basal lips the whorl is rather deeply, angularly 

 guttered. The back of the lip is creamy. Aperture very oblique, 

 smaller than in A. levettei. The teeth are arranged as in levettei. The 

 notch between the two basal teeth is wider than that between the outer 

 basal and the tooth of the outer lip. The inner basal tooth is smaller 

 than the outer. The cylindric umbilicus rapidly enlarges at the last 

 whorl.

This form was also found in the drift-debris of Barbakomari creek, 

 near Huachuca station. The same form was collected by Mr. Mearns 

 some years ago, and then referred to levettei. 



It differs from typical A. levettei in being smaller, with more closely 

 coiled whorls, the last one angular at the periphery. The aperture is 

 smaller and therefore more filled by the teeth. It resembles A. angu-

lata, but the whorls arc not flattened above as in that species, and are 

 not punctate. 



With a single exception mentioned below, no angigyra have been 

 found on the south side of the range. On the north side it occurs in 

 Brown's Canyon (figs. 50, 54), varying much in size and degree of angu- 

 lation, the smaller specimens being like the type lot, the larger ones 

 less angular and approaching levettei. Five measure :

At Ramsey Canyon, two miles east of Brown's Canyon, similar forms 

 were foimd at about 6,000 feet elevation. • 



On the opposite side of the range, at the base of Bear Canyon, in the 

 foothills, at about 5,000 feet, Mr. Ferriss collected a few small speci- 

 mens which do not seem to differ much from typical angigyra. Two 

 before me measure 5x11 and 4.8 x 10 mm., with only 5| whorls (figs. 

 51, 52, 53). 



The genital system (PI. XXI, fig. 28) is somewhat peculiar. The 

 penis is quite long, but the vagina is unusually short. This is unlike 

 A. angidata of the Chiricahuas, some forms of which imitate angigyra 

 in the form of the shell. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 14) has 8 very unequal ribs. 



The radula (PI. XXII, fig. 12) has 19.10.1.10.19 teeth. The ecto- 

 cones of central and inner lateral teeth are very short. The mesocone 

 is bifid from about the 15th tooth out, but the ectocone only on the 

 outer marginals. This approximates to the condition found in A. 

 chiricahuana. There are more teeth and more laterals than in A. angu- 

 lata. 



Ashmunella levettei heterodonta u- v. PI. XV, figs. 80-9L 



In Cave Creek Canyon and the tributary Ida Canyon on the southern 

 slope of the east end of the Huachuca range, Mr. Ferriss found an extra- 

 ordinary series of Ashm\mellas, in which the teeth vary from about as 

 well developed as in A. levettei to completely obsolete as in A. chirica- 

 huana. No other member of the genus was found in these canyons. 

 The several stages occur together,^ and the chain of mutations is unin- 

 terrupted.

242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



So far as I know, such variability in a land snail among individuals 

 living luider the same conditions in one spot is elsewhere absolutely 

 unknown. 



Most of the specimens measure from 15 to 18 mm. diam., but there 

 is one pygmy of 12 mm. (fig. 88). In the general shape, etc., the race 

 does not differ from A. levettei. There is no trace whatever of patho- 

 logic or abnormal growth. The forms with well developed teeth and 

 those with none were found much less numerous than the intermediate 

 stages. The most abundant forms (figs. 84, 85) may be considered the 

 types of the variety. 



The toothless examples have the lip slightly wider than that of A. 

 chiricahuana. They constitute a race parallel to that, rather than iden- 

 tical Avith it. 



. The colonies of Cave and Ida Canyons are evidently undergoing rapid 

 degeneration of the teeth, the parent form having been typical A. 

 levettei such as occurs in the adjacent canyon westward, and that over 

 the ridge. Examples of such degeneration are common enough at any 

 stage of progress; but the unique feature about it in this particular 

 colon}^ is that the individuals have been so unequally affected that all 

 stages of the process are present at one time and place. It does not 

 seem to be a case of hybridism between A. levettei and A. chiricahuana, 

 as I at one time suspected. The results are unlike hybrid colonies in 

 the predominance of intermediate individuals. 



Figs. 80 to 87 of PI. XV are a series from Ida Canyon, showing stages 

 of tooth development. Figs, 89, 90, 91 are from the Cave Creek Canyon 

 series. All of these figures are photographed from fully mature shells. 



Two specimens before me from Miller Canyon, or extreme head of 

 Cave Creek Canyon, Huachucas, figured on PL X^^, figs. 94, 95, may 

 be toothless heterodonta, as Mr. Ferriss suggests to me ; though from the 

 narrower lip I had provisionally called them A. chiricahuana, to which 

 the}^ seem absolutely similar. If the latter be correct, these are the 

 only specimens of that species I have seen from the Huachuca range. 

 They measure 18.3 and 16 mm. in diameter. The smaller shell is an 

 albino. 

 Ashmunella levettei proxima n. subsp. PI. XIV, figs. 65, 66, 70. 71. 



The shell is depressed, biconvex, strongly angular at the periphery, 

 pale corneous-brown. Whorls 6^, none with punctate sculpture. Aper- 

 ture like that of A. angulata, except that Ulc two basal teeth are nearer 

 together, the space between them being smaller than that betwee^i the outer 

 basal and the upper lip-tooth; though the two basal teeth are not united 

 basally as in A, fissidens.

Less carinated than the closely related A. fissidens which is appa- 

 rently a member of the same series. It is difficult to decide on the rank 

 to be given to the members of these chains of modifications of a single 

 type. A. proxima will probably be considered a species eventually. 



There are 14.10.1.10.14 teeth. The side cusps are very short, almost 

 subobsolete on the central teeth. The tenth to twelfth teeth are tran- 

 sitional. Both cusps are split on the marginal teeth. 



The genitalia (PL XXI, fig. 24) of one of the type specimens figured 

 has the atrium protruded. There seems to be an extremely short 

 basal enlargement or penis in another individual opened. The retractor 

 muscle of the penis is very weak. The proportions of the organs are 

 given in the table on p. 224. The very short penis contrasts with A. I. 

 angigyra, which also has more marginal teeth. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 17) is thin, with about 5 ribs, of which only 

 two are well developed. 

 Ashmunella fissidens n. 8p. PI. XIV, figs. 67-69. 



Shell depressed, lens-shaped, biconvex, with acutely angular periph- 

 ery; rather thin, brown. Sculptured with fine, irregular growth-lines, 

 the penultimate and next earlier whorls more or less roughened with 

 minute elevated points, as in A. angulata. Spire very low conoid. 

 Wliorls fully 6, closely coiled, moderately convex, the last usually a 

 little impressed above the periphery, wiiich is angular throughout. It 

 is convex below, and deeply guttered behind the reflexed outer and 

 basal margins of the lip. The suture descends a little to the aperture. 

 The aperture is very oblique, much obstructed by four teeth ; an oblique 

 parietal lamella, cm'ved in at its axial end, with, in old specimens, a very 

 low converging ridge outside of it, the two arranged AMike ; a long, 

 square-topped or concave-topped tooth within the outer lip; and two 

 contiguous teeth on the basal lip, slightly united basally the outer one 

 thick and higher, the inner low and more spreading. Parietal callous 

 distinct.

This species differs from A. angulata by its contiguous basal teeth, 

 but' is related to it by the punctate surface. It resembles A. dupHci- 

 dens in some respects, but the basal teeth are not nearly so closely 

 united "as in that snail, the periphery is carinate, not merely angular, 

 and the whole shell is much more depressed. 



Ashmunella duplicidens n. sp. Pi. XVI, figs. 103-107. 



Shell depressed, vmabilicate, brown or corneous-brown, glossy and 

 sculptured with minute growth-lines only. The spire and base are 

 convex, the periphery obtusely subangular in front, and situated above 

 the middle of the last whorl. There are 5f to 6^ closely coiled, narrow 

 and moderately convex whorls, the last one very slightly descending 

 in front. The aperture is ear-shaped, very oblique, the lip white, well 

 re flexed, and convex on the face. Within the outer margin there is a 

 somewhat retracted broad tooth, prominent at its two ends, concave 

 between them. Upon the basal lip there is a less widened, more emerg- 

 ing double tooth, the outer cusp larger than the inner. The parietal 

 wall bears an oblique, straight lamella.

Bearfoot or " Bar " Park, Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, at an

This species is an important link in the A, levettei chain, showing the 

 origin of the two basal teeth by splitting of an original median one. It 

 is less differentiated from the group of A . thomsoniana than the other 

 known Arizona species. 



The genitaha (PI. XXI, fig., 23) also resemble those of thomsoniana. 

 The general proportions are shown in the figure and table of measure- 

 ments. The penis is comparatively long. The duct of the sperma- 

 theca is large, weakly varicose, and contracted where it joins the 

 vagina. I did not make out any lower attachment of the penis 

 retractor muscle. 



There are about 18.10.1.10.18 teeth, nine or ten being laterals, the 

 next three or four transitional. The ectocone is not split on the mar- 

 ginals, at least not on most of them. 

 Ashmunella angulata n. sp. PI. XI, fig. 11 ; PI. XIV, figs. 55-61, 63, 64. 



The shell is lens-shaped, angular peripherally, rather narrowly um- 

 bilicate, glossy, reddish-chestnut when unworn, paler and more cor- 

 neous around the umbilicus and in the middle portion of the upper 

 surface, but frequently dull throughout by slight wear of the surface.

behind the lip there are fine, sharp strise. The embryonic whorl is 

 glassy, with fine radial strige on the outer side of the suture ; some part or 

 parts of the third or fourth whorls are sculptured with very minute raised 

 points in quincuncial order. The spire is low conic-convex, very obtuse 

 above, the first two whorls being almost in a plane. Whorls 6^ to 6f , 

 very narrow, and very slowly increasing; the first three are convex, those 

 following being decidedly flattened, onlj^ slightly convex. The last whorl 

 is acutely angular at the periphery, the angle more obtuse on its last 

 third. The base is convex. The suture descends a little to the aper- 

 ture. The lip is preceded by a creamy stripe, and the base is deeply 

 guttered behind the expansion. The aperture is very oblique, narrow 

 and lunate, obstructed by four teeth : a more or less sinuous, oblique 

 parietal lamella, two compressed, entering teeth on the basal lip, of 

 which the out«r one is higher and more compressed, and an oblique, 

 square-topped tooth within the outer lip. The sinus or notch between 

 the two basal teeth is slightly wider than that between the outer basal and 

 the outer lip tooth. The umbilicus is about one-sixth the diameter 

 of the shell.

 by Mr. Ferriss, February, 1904. 



The young shells show the characteristic punctation better than 

 adults. At resting periods in the neanic stage of growth a callous rib 

 is formed within the lip. When this occurs early (as in the specimen 

 figured, PL XI, fig. 11, 8 mm. diameter) the rib is much thicker in 

 the naiddle. When it occurs in the last whorl it is more equally 

 thickened. 



This species is closely related by shell characters, but not by its soft 

 anatomy, to A. levettei angigyra of the Huachuca range, agreeing with 

 that form in the close convolution of the whorls, the angular periphery 

 and the general arrangement of the teeth. But all fresh specimens of 

 A. angulata show a quincuncial punctation of some part of the neanic 

 whorls, not present in the Huachuca form, and the two especially 

 differ in the shape of the whorls, the upper surface of which is flattened

in angulata, convex in angigyra. Moreover, the genitalia of angigyra 

 and angulata differ in important respects. • 



As usual in Ashmunella and many other snails, the "species" is 

 composed of a group of varying colonies, all living in Cave Creek Can- 

 yon and its branches. The largest and best developed of these has 

 been taken as the type lot, PI. XIV, figs. 55-57. 



Another lot (87,015) from the South Fork of Cave Creek, "under 

 cliffs" (fig. 58), has smaller shells of a paler dull brown tint. The whorls 

 after the first 1^ are flattened; and there is sometimes a low ridge 

 making the parietal tooth V-shaped.

The genitalia of A. angulata (PI. XXI, fig. 26) are figured from a 

 specimen from the south fork of Cave Creek, No, 87,015, A. N. S. P. 

 The penis is very short (long in angigyra, see fig. 28) ; the epiphallus, 

 on the other hand, is very much longer than in angigyra; while the 

 spermatheca and its duct are of about equal length in the two species. 

 The vagina in A. angulata is rather long, as usual in Ashmunella, while 

 in A. I. angigyra it is much shorter than in any other Ashmunella I have 

 dissected. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 247 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 15) of the same specimen is thin, with per- 

 haps as many as eight very weak, narrow, dehcate unequal ribs. 



The teeth (PI. XXII, fig. 9, a group of lateral, transitional and mar- 

 ginal teeth) number 16.8.1.8.16 to 18.9.1.9,18 on different parts of the 

 same radula. There are 8 or 9 laterals and two or three transition 

 teeth. Some of the outer marginals have the ectocone bifid. 

 Ashmunella ferrissi n. sp. PI. XVI, figs. 108-110, 113. 



The shell is biconvex and acutely carinate, narrowly umbilicate, 

 brown, but slightly glossy, and sculptured with fine growth-wrinkles 

 only. The spire is convex, of 6^ very closely coiled and slowly widening 

 whorls, the earliest two convex, the rest flat, with a narrow keel project- 

 ing upward and outward above the suture. The last whorl is concave 

 above and below the keel, and descends verj'' shortly to the aperture. 

 The aperture is very oblique and obstructed by four white teeth: a 

 wide one slightly notched at the summit, just below the peripheral 

 angle ; two compressed teeth on the basal margin, connected by a low 

 flange on the face of the peristome ; these three teeth stand about equi- 

 distant. There is also a low prominence on the lip at the position of the 

 keel. On the parietal wall there is a straight lamella, very obliquely 

 placed and shortly, abruptly curved inward at the axial end.

The shell is mu^h depressed, lens-shaped, acutely carinate peripherally, 

 rather thin, and pale corneous-brown. The umbilicus, narrow within, 

 enlarges rapidly at the last whorl. Surface lightly marked with growth- 

 lines, but showing no trace of spiral striise or lines. The upper surface 

 is but slightly convex. The apex is sculptured like that of A. levettei. 

 Whorls 4^, slightly convex, the last very shortly descending in front. 

 Base more convex than the upper surface. The aperture is small and 

 very oblique, the lip well reflexed, white, with an obtuse, squarish tooth 

 in the outer margin and two compressed teeth in the basal margin, the 

 inner one smaller; these three being nearly equally spaced, or the outer 

 two may be nearer together. There is a rather short, straight, obliquely

Only a few specimens were found, and none living. While related 

 to the carinate forms of the A. levcttei group, and to A. mearnsi by the 

 structure of the aperture, this species is flatter than any of them, and 

 differs especially in the small number of whorls — less than in any other 

 Ashmunclla. It was named in honor of Mr. Bryant Walker, of Detroit.

In this species an accessory parietal lamella, incipient or rudimentary 

 in A. walkeri and some forms of the levettei series, is well developed. 

 The lip-teeth are arranged as in the A. levettei group. It is nearer A. 

 walkeri than any other known species, but some specimens of A. angu- 

 lala (fig. 58) have a weak upper arm of the parietal V. 



The geographic range is wide for a species of this group: the Hua- 

 chuca Mountains, in southeastern Cochise county, Arizona, the Ha- 

 cheta Grande Mountains, Grant county, southwestern New Mexico, and 

 the Organ Mountains, Donna Ana county. New Mexico, east of the 

 Rio Grande. All of these localities are near the Mexican boundary. 



The specimen figured is one of those collected in the Huachuca 

 Mountains by the well-known ornithologist Edgar A. Mearns, for whom 

 the species was named. 



The remarkable parietal armature is w-eakly foreshadowed in A . wal- 

 keri, some forms oi A. I. angigyra, etc. The soft anatomy remains 

 unknown.

Aperture of the shell without teeth. Length of the spermatheca and 

 its duct about 90 per cent, that of the penis, epiphallus and flagellum, 

 which do not much exceed twice the diameter of the shell. 



A single species from the Chiricahua Mountains differs strikingly 

 from the levettei and chiricahuana groups in the proportions of the 

 genitalia, the epiphallus being as short as in the thomsoniana group, 

 while the spermathecal duct is much longer.

Ashmunella esuritor n. sp. PI. XIII, figs. 2S-26. 



The shell is rather solid, light brown, biconvex, angular at the periph- 

 ery. The cylindric umbilicus is suddenly dilated in the last whorl. 

 The surface is irregularly marked with slight growth-wrinkles, and on 

 the last whorl there are impressed spiral lines, more or less irregularly 

 developed and sometimes almost obsolete. Some intermediate whorls 

 are indistinctly punctulate. Spire low-conic. Whorls 6^ to 6^, 

 slowly increasing. The first three whorls are convex, the rest more or 

 less flattened. The last whorl is distinctly but not acutely angular in 

 front, but becomes rounded in its later half. The suture descends a 

 little to the aperture, and the whorl is rather deeply guttered behind 

 the lip. The aperture is very oblique, roundly lunate. The peristome 

 is white, thickened within, and equably reflexed. In the middle of the 

 hasal margin there is a low, indistinct prominence, but there are no other 

 traces of teeth. The parietal callous is thin except in old specimens, 

 when it is thickened at the edge, forming a cord across the whorl,

At first glance this form seems to be a small angular race of A. chiri- 

 cahvxina; but upon closer study it seems far more likely that it is a 

 terminal member of the A. angulata group, in which the teeth have 

 degenerated. The slight flattening of the whorls, the shape of the 

 mouth, and a faint punctation observable near the end of the third 

 whorl in the freshest specimens, all indicate this relationship. Most 

 of the fully adult and old individuals seen have lost much or all of the 

 cuticle, and are dull flesh-tinted. 



The spiral engraved lines vary a good deal in different specimens, 

 and when slightly corroded neither spirals nor granulation are visible, 

 even in living shells. 



The smaller size, angular periphery and comparatively wider lip 

 readily distinguish A. esuritor from A. chiricakuana. 



The genital system (PI. XXI, figs. 30, 25) resembles that of A. chiri- 

 cahuana except that the ducts are very much shorter, both absolutely 

 and in comparison with the size of the shell ; and the spermatheca and 

 its duct are nearh'- as long as the penis, epiphallus and flagellum. The 

 extruded penis and atrium in another specimen are shown in fig. 25. 




250 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



The penis has low, slowly spiral ridges. The entire length of the organs 

 exserted is about 3.2 mm. 



The jaw ha*? about 7 unequal ribs. 



The teeth number about 16.12.1.12.16, the tenth to thirteenth being 

 transitional. Both cusps of the marginal teeth are bifid. 



Five shells taken in Sawmill Canyon, running from Bear Park,

This species has the general shape and rounded periphery of A. 

 levettei. It varies from chestnut to rather light greenish-brown, and 

 shells which have lost their cuticle are dull flesh-colored. It is very 

 glossy and smooth, marked with weak growth-wrinkles and engraved 

 spirals, which are distinct in some, almost obsolete in other specimens. 

 Under the compound microscope fine spiral striae are seen to cover the 

 surface between the spiral lines. Whorls about 5h, slightly convex. 

 The last descends a trifle in front, and is somewhat constricted behind 

 the lip. The aperture is without teeth. The lip is narrow, reflexed, 

 brownish above and at the edge, without trace of lip-teeth. The umbili- 

 cus opens rather widely at the last whorl. 



There is almost always an opaque yellow stripe on the last whorl, 

 marked inside by a strong white rib, and indicating a place of growth- 

 arrest. Some shells have several such variceal streaks on earlier whorls 

 also. The feature is a variable one in shells of the same lot, for reasons 

 I have elsewhere discussed in full. In one lot of 16 specimens from 

 Cave Creek Canyon, Chiricahuas, there are 3 specimens with a single 

 streak on last whorl, 8 with 2 streaks on last 2 whorls, 4 with 3 streaks 

 on last 3 whorls, and 1 with 4 streaks on last 3 whorls.

The diameter curve from this small series has a strongly marked

 diameter. 



There is a considerable variation in the height of the spire, shown 

 in the measm^ements above and in the figures, of which figs. 99 and 100 

 represent about the extremes of variation in this respect. 



Two specimens from the head of Miller Canyon, in the Huachucas, 

 measure 8.5 x 18.2 mm. and 8 x 16 mm. The smaller one is an albino, 

 greenish-white. These may be referable to A. levettei heterodonta, q. v. 



I have seen no Ashmunellas from Tucson, but no differential char- 

 acters have been indicated for the variety varicifera Ancey, from that 

 place. Nearly all the specimens from the Chiricahua range have 

 varices. 



The genital system (PI. XXI, fig. 29) is remarkable for the great 

 length of the epiphallus, vagina and spermatheca duct. The penis is 

 large and well developed. The specimens examined are from Cave 

 Creek Canyon, in the Chiricahuas. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 13) is stronger than in most of the species, 

 with 8 strong ribs and several weaker ones. 



The radula (PI. XXII, figs. 10, central and lateral, and 11, groups of 

 transitional and marginal teeth) has 16.13.1.13.16 or 16.14.1.14.16

Bear (Bearfoot or Barfoot) Park, Chiricahua Mountains, Cochise 

 county, Arizona. Types No. 88,885-6, A. N. S. P., collected by Mr. 

 J. H. Ferriss, 1904. 



Genitalia (PI. XXI, fig. 27) with a very short atrium. There is no 

 differentiated penis, the d^ organ being of equal calibre throughout, and 

 evidently an epiphallus. It terminates in the usual very short flagellum. 

 I can find no trace of a penial retractor muscle. The very long vagina 

 consists of a very slender lower portion and an excessively thick, muscidar

upper part. The spermatheca is long and narrow, its duct ratlior 

 short. The epiphallus and flagelhim measure 22 mm.; flagellum 2 

 mm.; spermatheca and duct 20 mm. The specimens had been placed 

 in alcohol without drowning. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 16) has seven ribs, grouped in the median 

 half, the ends smooth. 



The rad\ila (PI. XXII, fig. 8) has about 38.1.38 teeth. The ecto- 

 cones are developed on central and lateral teeth. From the twenty- 

 fourth or twenty-fifth teeth outward from the middle the inner cusp 

 is bifid. The ectocones are unsplit. A central and two lateral teeth 

 are shown. 



This snail, so far as the slieU is concerned, would be referred without 

 hesitation to A. chiricahvana; the differences being less than the ordi- 

 nary range of individual variation in Ashmunella or Polygyra; but the 

 genitalia are so utterly unlike in the two forms that it is obvious that 

 they are not even nearly related. From the granulation and the weak 

 traces of teeth it seems that A. metamorphosa is probably a toothless 

 derivative of the A. levettei stock; I regret that I have no alcoholic 

 specimens of A. levettei or A. I. heterodonta for comparison. ^4. esuritor 

 differs from metamorphosa by its angular or distinctly subangular 

 periphery, rougher siu-face when perfectly fresh, and perhaps somewhat 

 wider umbilicus; but it must be admitted that the two forms are so 

 similar that their distinction may be difficult without an examination 

 of the soft parts. The genitalia, however, are so very different that 

 the two species cannot even be closely related. They must be inde- 

 pendent derivatives from toothed ancestral forms. 



I dissected two of the three specimens received. They could be 

 extracted only by breaking into the shell. Having been preserved in 

 alcohol without drowning the specimens were much more contracted 

 than the A. chiricahuana and A. esuritor I examined. A somewhat 

 extensive experience with snails in all conditions of preservation has 

 shown that beyond a moderate diminution of the absolute size, the 

 characters of the genitalia are not altered by preservation of the animal 

 in strong alcohol. 



Genus SONOfiELLA Pilsbry. 



Pilsbry, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1900, p. 556 (definition, anatomy); 

 Bartsch, Smiths. Misc. Coll., Vol. 47, p. 187, 1904 (monograph). 



The soft anatomy of this genus has hitherto been known in a single 

 species. The study of numerous specimens of several species enables 

 me to extend the generic characterization. 



The shells in these Helices, while interminably modified locally in 




254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [Mch., 



size and minor details of shape and sculpture, show with few exceptions 

 no prominent specific differentiation. On the other hand, in the inter- 

 nal anatomy there has been a good deal of divergence. A few forms, 

 such as S. lohrii Gabb and S. wolcottiana Bartsch, seem to be quite dis- 

 tinct conchologically, but in many cases the determination of speci- 

 mens of the shells other than the type localities is so uncertain as to 

 be little better than guesswork, even when types are available for 

 comparison. In dealing with these ambiguous forms I have thought 

 the interests of science best furthered by applying specific names only 

 to those I am able to characterize anatomically, and thus put upon a 

 secure basis. 



An illustrated monograph of Sonorella, dealing with the shells 

 only, has been 'published by Mr. Paul Bartsch, who has devoted 

 great industry to the elucidation of the numerous species and 

 races. The work is of permanent value for its exact descriptions and 

 excellent figures, both of which I have had occasion to test; but it 

 deals with selected or "type" specimens only, ignoring the fact of 

 variation, and hence fails to give a just idea of the complex of varying 

 forms which exist, or even of the variations of size, etc., occurring in 

 the type lots. I would here express my indebtedness to Mr. Bartsch 

 for his invariable kindness in comparing for me various forms of *S. 

 hachitana with specimens in the U. S. National Museum. 



Mr. Bartsch has made the valuable observation that the embryonic 

 shells of Sonorella are sculptured, usually with oblique forwardly de- 

 scending threads, or with two sets of intersecting threads, sometimes 

 interrupted to form papilloe at their intersections. This sculptiu-e may, 

 I think, be the accelerated vestige of a somewhat similar sculpture 

 characteristic of the Californian Helices in their adult stage, and 

 which may thus have been common to the ancestral SonorcUas. 



The relationships of Sonorella are primarily with Oreohelix and Ash- 

 viunella. It differs from Oreohelix chiefly in the different proportions 

 of the kidney and pericardium, but also in the structure of the shell, 

 the oviparous reproduction, the unkeeled young shell, and in the dis- 

 tinctly ribbed jaw. 



Sonorella stands nearer Ashmunella in internal anatomy, but there 

 is a constant difference in the male organs, the penis being well devel- 

 oped in Sonorella, while in Ashmunella it is more or less completely 

 degenerate, the epiphallus being hypertrophic. The divergence between 

 the shells of the two genera is conspicuous. So far as the shell is con- 

 cerned, Sonorella stands nearer to the generally prevalent type of 

 Belogonous Helices than do either of the other genera. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 255 



Generic Characters of Sonorella. 



The genitalia (PI. XX) show no accessory organs on the female side. 

 The vagina is long ; the spermatheca is globular or ovate on a very long 

 slender branchless duct. The atrium is always extremely short. The 

 penis is a well-developed, thin-walled tube, containing a large papilla, 

 and terminating in a well-developed epiphallus. There is always a loose 

 sheath or wide collar enveloping the base of the penis, and attached 

 by muscular threads to the end of the epiphallus, which is thus held 

 loosely in a reflexed position. This sheath has been removed in most 

 of my figiu-es, as it obscures the parts enveloped. 



The retractor muscle is attached to the epiphallus close to the penis, 

 and is adnate to or envelops it to the apex of the latter. The fia- 

 gellum is extremely short, or even absent. The details of structure 

 are much vai'ied in the several species as described below under each 

 specific caption, and in the table of measurements. 



The free muscles, pallial complex and digestive tract have been de- 

 scribed in these Proceedings for 1900, p. 558. No material differences 

 have been observed in additional species examined. 



The jaw has four to eight ribs grouped in the median part, and either 

 strong or weak, as in the Californian Helices (PI. XXIII, figs. 18-23). 



The radula has imicuspid middle and lateral teeth, iDicuspid transi- 

 tional and inner marginal teeth and low, wide marginals with both 

 cusps bifid. Exactly the same type of teeth occurs in the Californian 

 Epiphragmophoras, in Ashmunella, Polygyra, etc. 



The upper surface of the foot is densely pebble-granose, with rather 

 indistinct dorsal grooves; the genital furrow is undeveloped except 

 near the mantle. The tail is depressed, rather long, and sometimes has 

 a weak median impressed line along the top. 



In my original diagnosis of Sonorella I stated that the shell was 

 "neither malleate nor spirally striate," Mr, Bartsch has also asserted 

 that "incised spiral lines are never present in this genus." This state- 

 ment must now be withdrawn, since several forms discovered by Mr. 

 Ferriss show impressed spiral lines; but they are inconspicuous, and 

 visible only under the lens.* To the eye, the shells of all known Sonorel- 

 las appear nearly smooth, the sculpture, aside from slight growth- 

 wrinkles, being microscopic. This is somewhat remarkable because 

 they often live in the same rock-piles with rudely sculptiu-ed Oreohelices. 



*Mr. Bartsch has excluded Helix carpenteri Newc. from Sonorella on account 

 of its spiral sculpture; but since I have found that this is not a diagnostic 

 character of the genus, I am* disposed, pending an examination of the soft 

 anatomy, to adhere to my former opinion that carpenteri belongs to Sonorella. 




256 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Mch., 



Up to this time, no carinate or even strongly angular species have been 

 found. Such uniformity in the shell is unusual in a Helicicl genus. 



The characters of the soft anatomy originally attributed to the genus 

 have proved to prevail in the more extensive material now examined, 

 except that in one species the fiagellum is obsolete. The penis was 

 incorrectly described in my original diagnosis, through my failure to 

 open it, and thus ascertain the exact limits of penis and epiphallus. 



Measurements of the Genitalia in Millimeters. 



Helix remondi Tryon belongs to another genus, still uncharacterized 

 anatomically, of the Belogona Euadenia. A living specimen sent me 

 by mail some years ago was crushed en route, partially decayed and 

 dried hard when it reached me. I soaked up the remains, and found 

 that the tail has a strong serrate keel above ; there is a slender, cylin- 

 dric-fusiform penis, but the rest of the genitalia were impossible to 

 make out. The radula does not differ materially from the Epiphrag- 

 mophora type. In Mexico, the genus Lysinoe and at least one species 

 of Leptarionta have the same extremely uniLsual structm-e of the tail. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



Neither is much Hkc H. remondi conchologically; but further informa- 

 tion on both H. remondi and Leptarionta is needed.

This is a widely distributed species in central and southeastern 

 Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. It varies in size, degree of 

 depression, width of umbilicus, size of aperture, and in color-tone; also 

 in some measure in the sculpture ; but so multifarious are the connect- 

 ing links that I do not now see my way to support the dismemberment 

 proposed by Mr. Bartsch. It will doubtless be found useful to recog- 

 nize by name a half-dozen or more local races. 



The internal anatomy of the types, from Hacheta Grande Mountains, 

 Grant county. New Mexico, is not known, nor have topotypes been dis- 

 sected. I have been able, however, to examine several specimens 

 from other localities, which conchologically differ very little from the 

 original lot of hachitana, some of which are before me. 



The name "hachitana" seems to be a perverted form of that of 

 the locality, "Big Hatchet." The Spanish name, locally in use, and 

 appearing on most maps, is "Hacheta Grande." 



1. Filmore Canyon, Organ Mountains, New Mexico (PL XVII, figs. 

 7, 8). A single specimen sent by Prof. Cockerell measures alt. 13.8, 

 diam. 23.5 mm., umbilicus 3.2 mm. The aperture is ample, 11.8 x 13.3 

 mm., as in the large shells from Florida Mountains. This specimen 

 has been referred by Mr. Bartsch to his S. nelsoni, which measured 

 25.5 X 13.4, umbilicus about 4 mm., aperture 11.1 x 12.8 mm., and is 

 said to differ from hachitana in being "more depressed and has a larger 

 aperture." 



The genitalia show that the specimen, while full grown, is not quite 

 mature, the male organs especially being thread-like. The sperma- 

 theca is globular, on a very slender duct. The specimen is No. 71,413, 

 A. N. S. P. It has been referred by Mr. Bartsch to S. nelsoni. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 19) has eight narrow equal ribs. 



2. Florida Mountains, near Deming, Luna county. New Mexico. 

 Mr. Ferriss states that these specimens were collected in a very barren, 

 arid locality. Very large specimens were taken measuring 28.3 x 15.9

mm., width of umbilicus 4.7 mm., or even larger 29.5 x 15.5 mm. 

 They exceed S. ashmuni Bartsch in size, and are larger than any Sono- 

 rella on record (PL XVII, figs. 1,2). The aperture is ample, 12.9 x 14.5 

 mm. 



Another lot (86,496, A. N. 8. P.), figured on PI. XVII, figs. 3-6, from 

 the same locality, consists of smaller specimens. Some are typical 

 hachitana in form and size except that the last whoj-l descends more 

 deeply in front, making the aperture subhorizontal in some specimens 

 (figs. 5, 6). In a few specimens the suprapcripheral band is almost 

 obsolete, very narrow and interrupted (figs. 3, 4), but most of them are 

 pale reddish-brown, fading to white in the middle region of the base, 

 and with a white or whitish band on each side of the dark supra- 

 peripheral l^elt.

Specimens of this lot were sent alive. 



The pale sole is indistinctly tripartite, extremely weak impressed 

 lines dividing it in some specimens, not traceable in others. The back 

 is slate or blue-blackish, the tail brown above, paler toward the foot- 

 edges. The surface is finely pebble-granulate. There is a pair of 

 indistinct dorsal grooves, and the genital furrow is traceable only near 

 the mantle. The tail is depressed, with a very faint median groove. 



The genitalia (PI. XX, fig. 12) show no differences of any moment 

 from the form of hachitana from Purtyman's ranch, Arizona, figm-ed 

 by me in 1900, except in the shape of the spermatheca, which, however, 

 is not constant in the Purtyman's lot. The individuals examined were 

 partly not fully developed, and possibly older specimens will show a 

 somewhat stouter vagina and penis than that figured. The penis 

 papilla is long and slender, not convoluted in tlie specimen opened. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 20) lias eight ribs. 



The radula is somewhat unlike other Sonorellas examined in the 

 central tooth, which is narrower than the adjacent laterals. There 

 are 55.1.55 teeth, an ectocone appearing on the fifteenth. Both cusps 

 are bifid on most of the marginal teeth, the mesocone + entocone being 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 259 



very oblique and unusually long in the inner marginals. This radula 

 differs a good deal from that of the Purtyman's ranch form, in both 

 count of the teeth and in some details of their shape ; but these features 

 are admitted by all who have examined many radulse to vary so widely 

 among individuals that their value is largely discounted. The dis- 

 crepancy between the forms should be controlled by the examination 

 of several of each form.

Purtyman's ranch, on Oak creek, 40 miles from Jerome, in the east- 

 ern edge of Yavapai county, Arizona. Collected by Rev. E. H. Ash- 

 mun, 1900 (No. 79,409, A. N. S. P.). 



These specimens furnished the anatomical preparations described 

 by me {Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1900, p. 557, PL XXI, figs. 1-5). 

 Specimens of this lot have been examined by Mr. Bartsch and pro- 

 nounced by him to be ''a small race of S. ashmuni. They bear the 

 same relation to ashmuni that S. mearnsi bears to *.S. dalli." I would 

 prefer to make an immaterial change in this statement. I would say 

 that S. ashmuni represents a large race or colony of S. hachitana, and 

 the Oak creek lot is nearly typical hachitana. 



The specimens are well-developed shells, often larger than typical 

 hachitana from Hacheta Grande Mountains. Nearly all are banded, 

 whitish above and below the band; but 3 out of 350 collected by 

 Mr. Ashmun at this place lack the dark band (figs. 13, 14). Speci- 

 mens measure: 



Compare with the measurements in parentheses of topotypes of 

 hachitana, part of the original lot, received from Dall. 



In general the aperture in the Purtyman ranch shells averages larger 

 than in tj^pical hachitana, but no hard and fast line can be drawn, and 

 selected individual specimens of each are simply indistinguishable, 

 either by measurements, color or any other character. The most we 

 can claim for *S'. ashmuni is the rank of a weakly differentiated local race 

 of S. hachitana, chiefly separable in actual practice by its geographic 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



distribution. The radula has fewer teeth in a transverse row than in 

 the hachitana from the Florida Mountains near Deming, New Mexico; 

 but only one radula from each locality has Vjeen examined. 



The color and other external features of the foot are as described for 

 S. virilis. The internal anatomy was described and figured in my 

 paper of 1900, PI. XXI. The spermatheca in another specimen of 

 the same lot was globular, as in other Sonorellas, not ovate with thick- 

 ened duct as in the individual figured, which was stuffed with spermato- 

 phores. The penis was wrongly described in my former article. I 

 did not then open it, and considered its upper portion to be epiphallic. 

 "Wlien opened (PI. XX, fig. 15) it is found to be a long, thin-walled sack, 

 the upper half containing a long, slender, more or less convoluted 

 papilla {p.p.). This is a little longer than in the hachitana examined 

 from the Florida Mountains. Otherwise the genitalia are practically 

 the same in the Florirla Mountains and Purtyman's ranch snails. 

 Sonorella hachitana bowiensis n. siibsp. PI. XVIII, figs. 29-32. 



The shell is similar to hachitana but is much smaller, with 4|^ to 4^ 

 whorls. The suprapcripheral band shows on about 2\ whorls, above 

 the suture on the spire ; on the last whorl it has very faint, inconspicu- 

 ous pale borders or none. No spiral lines are present in most specimens, 

 but in two they may be seen very faintly, near the periphery. Seven 

 fully adult shells measure : 



Bowie, Cochise county. Types No. 86,497, A. N. S. P., collected by 

 James H. Ferriss, 1904. Specimens were also taken by Mr. Ashmun 

 at the same place. Mr. Ferriss writes that they were taken "in a 

 situation exceedingly favorable for snails." 



The genitalia (PI. XX, figs. 10, 11) show externally only slight differ- 

 ences from hachitana. The penis and epiphallus are comparatively 

 a little longer. Internally, however, the penis differs in having a 

 short, obtuse papilla, only about 3 mm. long (PI. XX, fig. 10), while 

 in the forms referable to hachitana the papilla is twice as long, slender 

 and tapering. These features, which I have confirmed in a number 

 of individuals, indicate a certain amount of racial differentiation which 

 may properly be recognized in nomenclature. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 22) has four low, wide, unequal ribs and 

 some minor riblets.

The radula is like that of Purtyman's ranch hachiiana in general 

 features. The twelfth lateral shows a small ectocono, larger on suc- 

 ceeding teeth.

 zona. No. 83,273, A. N. S. P., collected by James H. Ferriss, 1902 

 (figs. 33, 34). 



Genitalia (PI. XX, figs. 13, 14). The penis is .short, containing a 

 short, cylindric, obtuse papilla. The free portion of the epiphallas is 

 about equal to the penis in length. The flagellum is reduced to a mere 

 tubercle, being much shorter than in any other Sonorella yet dissected. 

 The vagina is about as long as the penis, and the spermatheca and its 

 duct are about four times as long. 



The jaw has 6 or 7 narrow, unevenly spaced ribs. 



The radula has 44.1.44 teeth, like those of *S'. granulatissima. The 

 eleventh and twelfth are transitional. 



The last whorl is less deflexed than in S. h. howiensis, the aperture 

 is larger and the umbilicus smaller. Both penis and vagina are de- 

 cidedly shorter, though their proportionate lengths do not differ ma- 

 terially, and both have the penis-papilla short and obtuse; but in 

 S. rowelli the flagellum is reduced to a minute vestige, unlike any of the 

 other species. The remarkable constancy of this organ in the large 

 number of individuals of Sonorella and Ashmunella which have been 




262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



under my scalpel, gives reason for considering its modification in this 

 species of importance. 



I have identified these shells with S. rowelli (Newc), a species said 

 to have been collected in Arizona by Frick, many j^ears ago. S. arizo- 

 nensis (Dall), from Tucson, is more elevated, but is probably related 

 to rowelli. 



A form collected by Dr. G. H. Horn, the coleopterist, at Fort Grant, 

 Arizona, is closely related to the shells described above. 



In the Patagonia Mountains, a short distance eastward from the 

 locality of S. rowelli, a smaller form of the species was collected by Mr. 

 Ferriss (PI. XVIII, fig. 35), and also by Mr. Ashmun. The umbilicus 

 is narrower and more covered by the dilated lip than in Sanford's 

 rowelli, and the last whorl descends more deeply in front. The shells 

 measure : 



One of Mr. Ferriss' specimens (fig. 35) was sent alive, and proves to 

 be like the Sanford's rowelli anatomically, differing merely in the 

 smaller size of all the organs, except that there is no perceptible flagel- 

 lum (PI. XX, fig. 20, the terminal ducts only are drawn). The jaw 

 (PI. XXIII, fig. IS) has about 6 narrow^ equal ribs. 



The type measurements of H. rowelli given by Newcomb are alt. .4, 

 diam. maj. .6, min. .5 inch., about ecjual to 10, 15, 12.5 mm. The type 

 is in the collection of Cornell University.

The shell in the co-types of this species is thin, pale, with a rather wide 

 dark chestnut band without white borders, and visible above the suture 

 on the last 2h or 3 wliorls. The surface is very minutely and very 

 densely granulated over the usual low growth-wrinkles. Near the 

 periphery some faint traces of spiral lines may be deciphered in places, 

 but they are so slight that they would have been overlooked if not espe- 

 cially looked for. The umbilicus is small. The two co-types measure f 



* These measurements differ slightly from those given in the original descrip- 

 tion, due to the fact that at that time I used only a flat millimeter rule, upon 

 which it is, I find, impossible to read correctly the dimensions of globose shells.

They arc from "Spring Canyon/' near Fort Huachiica, No. 83,257, 

 A. N. S. P. 



The sole is indistinctly tripartite, the middle field ochraccous, the 

 sides dusky; the colors separated by very faint lines. The upper 

 surface is blackish-gray, evenly pebble-granose. A subobsolete dor- 

 sal line is discernible, and a very weak line on the tail, not c[uite 

 median. 



The two co-types were dissected. The genitalia (PI. XX, figs. 16. 

 17, 18) are characteristic by the proportions of the penis and vagina. 

 The penis is short, cylindric, composed of a thin-walled sack containing 

 a large, fleshy, cylindric papilla (fig. 18). Epiphallus and flagellum 

 (fig. 16) as usual. The vagina is large, i^ery long and muscular, about 

 three times the length of the penis. Its upper portion is s^^•ollen and 

 sometimes fusiform. Other organs as usual (see table of measure- 

 ments). 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 23) has four very wide, low, flat ribs. 



The radula has 36.1.36 teeth, the central and inner laterals unicuspid, 

 the eleventh showing a minute ectocone. Most of the marginal teeth 

 have both cusps bifid.

 whorl. Umbilicus typical. 



4. Carr Canyon (PL XVHI, figs. 51-54). These shells show the 

 spiral lines more or less distinctly. They are otherwise typical, but 

 vary a good deal in size. 



5. Miller Canyon (PL XVIII, figs. 41 , 42, 43) . Of a rich dark reddish 

 color with a wide darker band, well granulated and showing weak or 

 excessively faint spirals. More depressed than any other granulatissi- 

 ma seen; and in some specimens the umbilicus is decidedly wider, 3 

 mm. in a shell 18.5 mm. diameter. 



There were also some much lighter, greenish-yellow shells taken in 

 Miller Canyon (PL XVIII, figs. 39, 40, 44). They arc much depressed, 

 with a wide umbilicus and very distinct spiral striation (PL XI, fig.

Eleven specimens of this small form were obtained at the place men- 

 tioned. It is chiefly notable for the subangular periphery, v^ry unusual 

 in Sonorella. It is very similar to S. mearnsi Bartsch, differing in the 

 wider umbilicus and more oblique aperture. S. mearnsi may prove 

 to be a subspecies of *S. granulatissima, but its internal anatomy is 

 unknown.

This form is very similar to S. granulatissima, from which it differs 

 in the usually larger size and the more depressed last ivhorl. The granu-

lation is finer and less distinct than in typical granulatissima, and the 

 umbilicus is slightly wider. The supraperipheral band is wide, and has 

 no paler borders. There are 4f whorls^ the last rather deeply deflexed. 

 The embryonic shell is sculptured as in *S. hachitana.

The soft anatomy is unknown, but the form, while not conspicuously 

 differentiated, is yet readily distinguishable from >S. granulatissima. 

 Specimens sent to Mr. Bartsch were pronounced by him to ''stand 

 half way between S. dalli and S. granulatissima." 

 Sonorella dalli Bartsch. 



Smiths. Misc. Coll., Vol. 47, p. 193, PI. 21, fig. 1 (October 10, 1904). 



This form is somewhat larger and more depressed than S. g. latior. 

 It is described as with "numerous microscopic granulations," but in 

 one of the type lot kindly presented by Dr. Dall these are hardly appre- 

 ciable. The type measurements are alt. 12, diam. 26.5, aperture 

 10.5 X 11.8 mm.; and Mr. Bartsch has kindly supplied the diameters 

 of the rest of the series in the U. S. National Museum, as follows : Type 

 lot, Tanner's Canyon, Huachuca Mountains, 26.5, 26.1, 25.9, 24.1, 24, 

 the last two not quite mature. Huachuca Mountains, 25.3 mm. Fort 

 Huachuca, 24.6 mm. 



The smallest mature specimen of *S'. dalli slightly exceeds the largest 

 latior by 1 mm., and the smallest adult latior measures the same as the 

 largest granidatissima. S. mearnsi Bartsch, from the San Jose Moun- 

 tains, 4 miles south of the Arizona boundary, measm-es 16 mm. diam., 

 being 1.5 mm. smaller than the smallest adult granidatissima. It is 

 quite conceivable that S. dalli and S. mearnsi are merely the extremes 

 of dimensions in a continuous series of variations in size. Since «S. 

 granidatissima is the only form of the scries known anatomically, the 

 ultimate status of the others remains in abeyance. Some or all of 

 them may prove to have valid anatomical specific characters.

 Sonorella virilis n. sp. PL XVII, tigs. :5, ifi. 



The shell is openly umbilicate ; pale brown, lighter around the um- 

 bilicus, with a dark band above the periphery, and visible on about 2^ 

 whorls above the suture, with borders a trifle paler than the ground 

 color. Whorls 4^, the earlier 1^ forming a slightly rugose embryonic 

 shell. The next 1 or 1^ whorls arc striate, the striie appearing slightly 

 broken into granules. The last whorl has the usual slight growth-lines . 

 and near the end some spiral lines are visible, in the vicinity of the 

 suture. The whorl descends rather deeply, and is well rounded 

 peripherally. The aperture is rather large, oblique and rounded, the 

 upper, outer and basal margins about equally arcuate. The outer and 

 basal margins of the thin lip are slightly expanded. Alt. 11, diam. 19.5, 

 umbilicus 3.1 mm.; aperture 9.3 mm. high, 10 wide. 



Chiricahua Mountains, at 7,500 feet elevation, collected by V. Owen. 

 Type 79,622, A. N. S. P. 



There are no longitudinal lines on the sole. The pebbly-granose back 

 and the eye-stalks are blackish-gray, becoming much paler dirty brown- 

 ish-white on the sides and tail. Dorsal grooves are but weakly indi- 

 cated, and there is no longitudinal median line on the tail. 



The kidney is wedge-shaped, 15 mm. long. Pericardium 5.5 mm. 

 long. 



Genitalia (PI. XX, figs. 21, 22). The penis is relatively enormous, 

 more than dovible the length of the vagina, and much longer than the 

 spermatheca and its duct. It has the usual thin wall, enclosing a 

 fleshy "papilla" about 29 mm. long (fig. 21). The epiphallus is also 

 very long, slender and convoluted. The vagina is mucli convoluted. 

 The spermatheca has the usual globular shape ; and its slender duct, 

 while long, is shorter than in other species of equal or greater size. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 21) has four broad ribs grouped near the 

 middle. 



S. virilis is slightly smaller than *S'. hachitana, with more rounded 

 aperture and weak spiral lines near the suture. From the shell 

 alone I would not separate this form more than varietally from S. 

 hachitana ; but the enormously developed cJ^ rej^roductive organs indi- 

 cate one of the most distinct species of the genus. The jaw has few 

 ribs, as in S. h. howiensis. It is not closely related to any other species 

 I have dissected. 



The faint spiral lines of the shell are perhaps its most important 

 differential feature. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2;^7 



Several lots collected by Mr. Ferriss in the Chiricahua Mountains 

 resemble S. virilis in size, color and sculpture, but differ in having about 

 one-fourth of a whorl more (4f), and a noticeably smaller aperture. 

 The spiral lines, while visible in some places on all of them, in a favor- 

 able light, are often excessively weak. None of them, unfortunately, 

 were sent in the flesh. 



In Bar (or Bearfoot) Park, at the summit of the Chiricahuas, the 

 specimens taken show some very weak spiral lines below the last suture.

In Sawmill Canyon, Chiricahuas, adjacent to Bearfoot Park, similar

 19,20). 



Sonorella virilis circumstriata n. subsp. PL XVIII, figs. 48-50. 



In Cave Creek Canyon, Chiricahuas, the shells are darker throughout, 

 reddish-brown, with a broad very dark chestnut band with wide pale 

 borders, sometimes not very conspicuous. The last whorl shows weak 

 but distinct spiral engraved lines above the periphery, in addition to 

 the usual fine growth-strise. The umbilicus varies from about 3.3 to 

 3.8 mm. in width. A. N. S. P., No. 87,026.

Diam. apert. 10.7 10.4 10 9.5 " 



The genitalia (PI. XX, fig. 19) in two specimens dissected agree in 

 having several minor differences from typical S. virilis. The penis, 

 while still extraordinarily large, is only about two-thirds as long as in 

 virilis. The vagina is a fourth longer. The epiphallus is the same as 

 in virilis. 



This form may prove to be connected with typical virilis by 

 intermediate stages, in which case the subspecies may prove super- 

 fluous; but at present the dark color, more distinct spiral striae, and 

 small aperture of the shell, and the somewhat differently proportioned 

 genitalia, seem worth recording. 

 Sonorella virilis huachucana n. subsp. PI. XVII, fig. 24. 



Shell slightly more elevated than S. hachitana, with much smaller 

 umbilicus; more elevated than >S. virilis, which also is more widely 

 umbilicate; glossy, thin, striate but without granulation. The top 

 of the last whorl, near the aperture, shows numerous weak spiral incised

lines. The supraperipheral l^and is rather wide and dark, with distinct 

 ivhite or ichitish bands both above and below it. Above the upper white 

 band the surface is pale reddish to the white siitural Hne. Below the 

 lower white border the same reddish color prevails, but gradually fades 

 on the base to whitish around the umbilical region. The dark band 

 run§ about 2i whorls up the spire. Apex with sculpture like S. hachi- 

 tano.. Whorls 4f , the last rather deeply descending in front. Aper- 

 ture rounded-oval, the peristome thin, expanded, the dilated columellar 

 end partially covering the umbilicus. Alt. 12.4, diam. 20.6, alt. aper- 

 ture 10, width 11.5 mm.; width of umbilicus 2.4 mm. 



Browm's Canyon, Huachuca Mountains. Type No. 89,225, A. N. S. P., 

 collected by James H. Ferriss, 1904. 



This beautiful snail is the only Huachuca form I have seen which 

 seems closely related to *S. virilis. Unfortunately, the soft parts were 

 not preserved, and its exact relationships are thus uncertain. It is 

 not very imlike S. hachitana, but I can see no spiral lines on some of the 

 original lot of hachitana before me. The white bordering bands are 

 particularly conspicuous. Only a few were taken by Mr. Ferriss. 



In Bear Canyon, Huachuca Mountains, Mr. Ferriss found a few 

 specimens similar to those from Brown's Canyon, but noticeably more 

 depressed, with a smaller mouth and obtuse lip. One measures, alt. 

 11.5, diam. 20, aperture 9.8x11 mm., umbilicus 3 mm. wide. The 

 shell is also somewhat more solid, and the spiral lines are more distinct. 

 In both forms they are readily seen with a hand lens.

A new genus of Helicidce, Pilsbry, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1902, p. 511. 



Oreohelix Pils., Nautilus, XVII, p. 131, March, 1904. 



The shell is umbilicate, varying from discoidal to pyramidal, with 

 4 to 6 tubular or carinate whorls; earthy, with thin cuticle or none. 

 Embryonic whorls with radial and usually spiral sculpture and carinate 

 periphery. Aperture rounded, oval or angular, oblique, the columel- 

 lar lip dilated, the outer lip blunt or acute, uncxpanded. The sole is 

 undivided. Foot granulose and blackish above or smoothish tessel- 

 lated with gray. A pair of dorsal grooves is present and usually a (iis- 

 tinct genital groove. The tail is depressed above. No parapodial 

 furrows. 



The lung has thin-walled venation, chiefly on the cardiac side. The 

 kidney is short, but little longer than the pericardium ; has a large lumen 

 with coarsely plicate walls, and the usual reflexed ureter. The second- 

 ary ureter is closed throughout in the species examined (PI. XIX, fig. 1, 

 0. strigosa var., Pecos, New Mexico). 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 269 



The penis is well developed, its lower part being muscular, and pli- 

 cate within, the upper part thinner and densely, finely papillose inside. 

 The epiphallus is well developed, with terminal vas deferens or with a 

 terminal tubercle (representing the flagellum) and a sublaterally in- 

 serted vas deferens. The vagina is rather long. The globular or ovate 

 spermatheca terminates a slender duct nearly as long as the uterus. 

 Reproduction is viviparous. 



The retractor muscle of the penis arises from the apex of the penis 

 and base of the epiphallus, or from the epiphallus near its base, and is 

 inserted on the lung floor. The right ocular retractor passes between 

 the (2^ and 9 branches of the genitalia. 



The jaw is strong, arcuate, its anterior face more or less distinctly 

 striated vertically; and there are sometimes very weak traces of ribs. 

 The radula is of the ordinary Helicid type. In some species the median 

 area has unicuspid teeth, the cutting-edges usually overhanging the 

 sides of the mesocone; while in others distinct ectocones are developed 

 in all the teeth. The marginal teeth are bicuspid, the cusps unsplit 

 as a rule, though there are exceptions where the inner of the two cusps 

 is bifid. 



Type Helix strigosa Gld. Distribution, Rocky ^Mountain region from 

 the Canadian to the Mexican boundary. 



This dominant type of Helicidce in the area indicated above formerly 

 extended farther east, one species occurring in the loess of Iowa, and 

 there is one outlying species westward, 0. avalonensis Hemph., on 

 Catalina Island, California. In its present area the type has been in- 

 terminably modified into local races of all grades of differentiation, 

 more than fifty of these having received names.^ It is true that in some 

 ranges every canyon— I might almost say every rock-heap — has its own 

 race ; but in a broader view it is seen that a single strain usualh' extends 

 over an entire range with numerous minor modifications, and with 

 increasing elevation a general diminution of size, loss of sculpture and 

 often intensification of color. These reduced forms are probably due 

 to the diminished food supply and especially the shorter growing season 

 in the heights — factors subject to great local variation, even at equal 



' The number of species of Oreohelix is uncertain. About fifty forms of all 

 degrees of differentiation have been described and named. My treatment of the 

 group in former pubhcations (Manual of Conchology, VIII, p. 11.5, IX, p. 50; 

 Catalogue of the Land Sheli'^ of America, etc., pp. 31, 32 (1898), was unchily influ- 

 enced by iihe views of Binnej' and Hemphill, both of whom advocated the inclusion 

 of the entire series as varieties of P. strigosa. The cliaracters of the shells, 

 penes and teeth indicate, in my opinion, that the species are somewhat' numer- 

 ous; but their notorious variability cautions us to beware of multiplying tliem 

 without ample materials.

altitudes. To attain a true idea of the relationships of any given alti- 

 colous dwarf it is essential to know the forms of the lower canyons of 

 the same region. 



The first step toward a fundamental knowledge of the races and 

 species of Oreohelix must be the study and definition of races in the 

 broad sense above indicated. In my opinion, the minor modifications 

 can be so overnamed that the wider distinctions become altogether lost, 

 as in the Utah series. The field is vast, and for many years to come 

 there will be plenty of room for work. Anybody who secm-es a good 

 series of the forms of any district can materially help the cause by 

 working them up. 



The sculpture of the embryonic shells and the genitalia seem to afford 

 the most important characters for specific classification. It would , 

 take us too far afield to discuss the entire mass of data at hand. This 

 must be reserved for another occasion. Only forms from central and 

 southern Arizona and New Mexico are dealt with below.' The meas-

The species thus far dissected show considerable differences in the 

 genitalia, chiefly in the proportions and shape of the penis, the forms 

 falling into three groups, as follows: 



' For comparison with the southern forms I have, however, figured the anatomy 

 of 0. elrodi (Pils.), from Montana, PI. XIX, fig. 2. The penis is like that of O. 

 strigosa, from Pecos, the lower third having thick walls, densely plicate within; 

 above that the walls are thinner, densely lined with long papillse, and in the upper 

 third there are several low fleshy ridges, also papillose. There is an extremely 

 short, conic penis-papilla in the apex. The vas deferens enters the epiphallus 

 centrally. The vagina is much dilated and muscular above. The uterus is pro- 

 vided with muscular strands forming an incoherent protractor muscle (fig. 2, 

 r.u.). The embryos were packed in like coins except the two lower ones. The 

 dimensions are given in the table. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 271 



1. Penis long, the distal half strongly twisted, there being two dis- 

 tinct kinks, resulting in convolutions variously disposed, and of course 

 not alwa^^s falling the same in the same species or variety. 0. strigosa, 

 from Pecos, and 0. elrodi (PL XIX, figs. e3 and 2) belong here. 



2. Basal half of the penis swollen and muscular, the distal half 

 smaller, without distinct kinks. 0. s. huachucana and 0. harhata (PI. 

 XIX, figs. 6 and 5) are of this type. 



3. Penis small, short, the basal half not much larger than the distal 

 l^ortion, the latter not kinked. 0. neomcxicana and 0. yavapai (PI. 

 XIX, figs. 7 and 9) have penes of this kind. 



All the above have the penis longer than the epiphallus. In the 

 subgenus Radioccntnim the epiphallus is as long as the penis or 

 longer. 



As yet my observations have covered only about a dozen of the num- 

 erous species and subspecies ; and until more of the forms of the central 

 and northern States are examined, characters of the soft anatomy 

 cannot be fully utilized in classification. 



There are two types of dentition in Oreohelix. The ordinary forms 

 have unicuspid central and inner lateral teeth. Here stand 0. strigosa, 

 cooperi, newcombiana, huachucana, yavapai, neomcxicana. and haydcni. 

 In the second type of teeth ectocones are developed on all of the t^eth, 

 the centrals being thus tricuspid, the lateral and marginal teeth all 

 bicuspid. Of this kind are 0. idahoensis, 0. hemphilli, 0. harhata, 0. 

 chiricahuana and 0. clappi, but in the last species the ectocones are not 

 well developed. 



The series of Huachuca Orcohelices shows that colonies of the same 

 original stock vary greatly and often show parallel variations in differ- 

 ent canyons. 



Those from the greatest altitudes are smallest (PI. XXI\^, figs. 25-27, 

 29-32, Limestone Mountain, 8,000 feet; PL XXIV, fig. 28, Carr Can- 

 yon, 7,000 feet, etc.), though some large shells occur elsewhere at equal 

 elevations. 



Conspicuously banded shells were taken only at high elevations 

 (PL XXIV, figs. 17, 18, Brown Canyon, 7,000 feet), plainer ones occur- 

 ring lower down in the same canyon; but not all the high altitude 

 shells are so marked. 



Gerontic or senile individuals or colonies are common, manifested 

 by deep descent of the last whorl in front, with a tendency to form a 

 free or solute peristome (PL XXV, figs. 33-35, Ida Canyon). 



The carinatc periphery is an ancestral character of 0. strigosa and 

 its allies, present invariably in the noanic stage. It wall be noted that 




272 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mch., 



in most colonics there is great individual variation in the extent to 

 which it has been replaced in the adult stage by a rounded periphery. 

 Oreolielix strigosa (Old.)- 



Various forms referable to strigosa occur in New Mexico, such as those 

 sent from the Red river (Ashmun), Pecos (Cockcrell), Canyon Diablo, 

 near Rowe (Miss Cooper), and Big Spring, 5 miles east of Zuni (H. S. 

 Conard). They are two-banded, with the periphery of the last whorl 

 rounded, not differing from the forms commonly found farther north, 

 but slightly unlike the typical Northwestern strigosa. The exact affini- 

 ties of these forms await further investigations now in progress. 



I have examined the internal anatomy of specimens fiom Pecos, 

 New Mexico. The shells are either rounded or subangular at the 

 periphery in adults. Sculpture of sharp, irregular growth-wrinkles 

 or striae, decussated by slightly impressed spiral lines both above 

 and below. The color varies from yellowish Isabelline to light 

 reddish, with paler striae, always with two narrow bands, and in one 

 specimen a third band around the umbilicus. The embryonic 

 shell is strongly carinate. The first whorl is convex and almost smooth ; 

 then fine, regular, obliquely radial striae appear, and continue to the 

 end of the embryonic shell of 2 to 2-J- whorls; over them there is an 

 extremeh^ minute regular spiral striation, and on the last half whorl 

 coarser, spaced spirals (PI. XXV, figs. 45, 46, 47). 



The specimens examined were taken August 9, 1903. The penis is 

 very long and strongly twisted. The basal third of its length is cylin- 

 dric, the rest more or less lank, partially collapsed. Internally the 

 basal third (5 mm.) is rather finely plicate longitudinally, thick-walled ; 

 the rest has larger lumen and thinner walls, which are densely papillose 

 within, the distal half having three low fleshy internal ridges. The 

 penial retractor is inserted upon the end of the penis and the base of 

 the epiphallus, which is decidedly less than one-half the length of the 

 penis. The vagina is subcylindric. The uterus is distended with 

 embryos, of which there are 9, with shells 3 to 4 mm. in diameter (PI. 

 XI, figs. 14, 15). Each is enclosed in a membranous capsule, ap- 

 parently the podocyst. Some of them seem to have a small cephalic 

 vesicle. The other 9 organs call for no especial notice (PI. XIX, fig. 3). 



The pallial organs have been described above. The kidney is 6.7, 

 the pericardium 4.6 mm. long. 



The foot is slate-blackish and finely granular alcove, the dorsal fur- 

 rows distinct. The distinct genital furrow is duplicated on the left 

 side. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 25) has fine vertical striae. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 273 



The radula (PI. XXII, figs. 1, 2, 3) has 29.1.29 teeth. Central and 

 inner lateral teeth are imicuspid. An ectocone appears on tne eighth 

 or ninth teeth. The marginal teeth are all bicuspid (fig. 2). 



Mr. Binney has figiu-ed the genitalia of a specimen of strigosa from 

 Salmon river. Just what race it belongs to is not positively known. 

 It differs from the Pecos form of strigosa by the shorter, apparently 

 untwisted penis. The epiphallus and vagina are also shorter. He 

 figiu-es the teeth of strigosa with the ectocone split on an extreme mar- 

 ginal, and the radula had 50.1.50 teeth — a far greater number than I 

 have encountered in this genus. The teeth of 0. haydeni as figured by 

 Binney are like those of Pecos strigosa, and 33.1.33 in number. 0. 

 elrodi has 28.1. 28 similar teeth, the tenth with an ectocone, marginals 

 bicuspid . 



Forms referable to Oreohelix cooperi have been found by Prof. Cock- 

 erell in central New ilexico. None were turned up in the regions 

 explored by Mr. Ferriss. 



Oreohelix strigosa concentrata (Dall). 



Patula strigosa var. concentrata Dall, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XVIII, 1895, 

 p. 1 ; XIX, p. 336. 



This was described from a dwarf form of the mountain tops, the 

 types from the summit of the Huachuca ^Mountains, Cochise county, 

 Arizona. Through the courtesy of Dr. William H. Dall, I have one 

 of the typical lot (No. 89,237, A. N. S. P., from No. 129,999, U. S, 

 Nat. Mus.), and a series from the top of Hacheta Grande, 9,000 feet 

 elevation (No. 65,742, A. N. S. P.). 



1. Typical concentrata is white with two dark red-brown bands, the 

 lower one wider, and some livid clouding on the upper surface. The 

 5 whorls are convex, the last rounded peripherally, with a slight and 

 inconspicuous trace of angulation at its origin. The umbilicus is tvidely 

 open, very ample within. Sculpture of low, rude, nearly effaced 

 wrinkles, with no trace of spiral lines am^vhere. The type measures 

 alt. 8, diam. 16 mm., the specimen before me 7.8 x 14.8 mm. with the 

 umbilicus 4 mm. wide. 



0. s. concentrata is a relatively evolved form, having lost the keel on 

 the last whorl. Tne embryonic whorl seems to be similar to that of 

 huachucana. There are no spirals on the last whorl. Diam. 14 to 

 16 mm. 



The following lots from the Huachucas seem reierable to concentrata. 



2. Carr Canyon, 7,000 feet (PL XXIV, fig. 28). Similar to typical 

 concentrata, with the same depressed shape, very ample umbilicus and 

 nearly effaced sculpture, but fine radial ripples are visible on the em-

 nut, blackish in places, the upper band sometimes extending to the 

 suture.

Diam. 15.2 15 15 " 



3. Limestone Mountain, Huachucas, south side at 8,000 feet eleva- 

 tion (PI. XXIV, figs. 29-31). The shells are whitish with some fleshy 

 or livid streaks or dots, and with two bands, or clouded and suffused 

 with purple-brown. Similar to typical concentrata except that the 

 umbilicus is decidedly smaller within. The last whorl descends to the 

 aperture. They arc like 0. s. huachucana, No. 3, from Brown Canyon, 

 in miniature. They are rounded or slightly angular in front. The 

 sculpture is suhobsolete, without a trace of spirals. 



Scalariform monsters are not rare, but the inception of that abnormal 

 condition seems to be invariably traceable to an injury of the shell. 

 One such is figured (PI. XXIV, fig. 31). 



4. Limestone Mountain, south side, 8,000 feet. Like the preceding, 

 but more elevated and fleshy white with pinkish apex. The last whorl 

 descends rather deeply (PI. XXIV, fig. 32). 



Alt. 10 9.7 8.7 mm. 



Diam. 15.3 15.5 13.7 " 



5. Limestone Mountain, north side, 8,000 feet. Similar to the two 

 preceding lots in size and sculptm-e, but broadly two-banded with 

 purple-black, or entirely of this color (PL XXIV, figs. 25, 26, 27). 

 This lot resembles 0. s. hunchucnna, Nos. 11, 12, from Carr Canyon, 

 which are also from a high altitude. No. 5 from 7,000 feet. Brown

 tnro. Whether these shells arc to be regarded as really identical with 

 the Iluachuca concentrata, or as a parallel dwarf race independently 

 evolved, is a question remaining to be determined by a study of the 

 forms from the lower canyons of the Hacheta Grande Mountains. 



Oreohelix strigosa huachucana (Pils.). PI. XXIV, figs. 5-7 (types). 



" Pyraniidula" strigosa huachucana Pils., Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1902, 

 p. 511.^ 



1. The types are from "Conservatory Canyon," otherwise known 

 as Ramsey Canyon, on the northeastern slope of the Huacnucas 

 between Brown and Carr Canyons. 



They are depressed with a broad umbilicus, exposing more of the 

 penultimate whorl than strigosa,^ and it is also more ample within. 

 There arc 5 whorls, of which 2h are embryonic. The tip is a little de- 

 pressed ; the first whorl is delicately striate or wrinkled in an obliquely 

 radial direction. On the second whorl weak raised spiral lines asually 

 set in; and the last embryonic whorl is rather coarsely, irregularly 

 wrinkled radially, and finely striate spirally, with (in some shells) sev- 

 eral raised threads on the last half whorl. These cease abruptly at the 

 end of the embryonic stage. The following whorls are irregularly, 

 obliquely wrinkled and have at most obsolete spiral lines or traces of 

 them in places, often almost imperceptible. The base has no spiral 

 striation as a rule, but in some specimens from Carr Canyon there arc 

 faint spirals there. Up to the end of the fourth whorl the periphery is 

 strongly carinate, but in adult shells it is nearly angular in front, the 

 last half or more becoming rounded. The suture follows the crest of 

 the keel, and usually descends a trifle to the aperture. 



The shell is flesh-colored above, with irregular whitish streaks or 

 maculse; beneath, the opaque white predominates more, and there 

 is a purplish-brown band close to the periphery (but 4 or 5 of 25 exam- 

 ined are equally flesh-tinted beneath, and lack the band, PI. XXIV, 

 fig. 8). The aperture is small, very oblique, with the ends of the lip 

 approaching. The peristome is not expanded.

 Huachuca as Helix (Patula) hemphilli Newc. {Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XVI, 1893,

fig. 6). It was taken in February, during the inactive season, and the 

 uterus is quite small. The dimensions of the organs are given in the 

 table (p. 270). The lower half of the penis is much swollen, the upper 

 half smaller and lank. When opened the basal narrower portion is 

 found to have strong acute folds; these become weak in the swollen 

 part, which contains a large fleshy process adnate to the upper side. 

 The contracted upper portion of the penis is papillose inside, with three 

 low ridges. 



The retractor muscle and epiphallus arc as in Pecos strigosa. The 9 

 organs show nothing noteworthy. 



The radiila (PI. XXII, fig. 5, group of transitional teeth) has 30.1.30 

 teeth. Those of the median area are much as in Pecos strigosa, with 

 overhanging mesocones only. The ectocone begms weakly on the sixth 

 or seventh, and is well developed on the eleventh tooth. The marginal 

 teeth are all Vjicuspid, the cusps unsplit. 



0. s. huachucana is widely distributed in the canyons of the Huachuca 

 Mountains, and nearly every colony has some individual features. 

 "Sometimes only one form was found in a colony, but usually they 

 vary in color and form. They are slow travelers and hence the dis- 

 tinctive characteristics of the colonies. They had not encroached at 

 all upon the ground burned over two years ago. Colonies on different 

 sides of the divides between canyons were entirely different, even when 

 but a hundred or two hundred feet apart" (Ferriss). 



Brown Canyon, Huachuca Mountains. Numerous colonies in this 

 canyon vary in color, but in all the periphery of the last whorl may 

 either be rounded, as in the type lot, or the acute keel of the young may 

 extend upon the first third or half. The color-forms of the individual 

 colonies are as follows: 



2. Solid, opaque pinkish-white, with a few fleshy streaks and scattered 

 dots. Sculpture weak (PI. XXIV, figs. 9, 10). 



3. Similar, but with a narrow band on the upper surface and on the 

 base a band below the periphery, as in the typical form. Frequently 

 the upper surface is largely fleshy-brown. This is an abundant form, 

 differing from the Conservatory Canyon race only in the frequent 

 retention of the keel in adults (PI. XXIV, figs. 11, 12, 16). 



4. Dull brown predominates throughout. Usually there are no 

 bands (PI. XXIV, figs. 13, 14). This and all the preceding from Brown 

 Canyon are from about 7,000 feet. Some specimens are like the 

 following form. In one gerontic colony at 6,000 feet the peristome is 

 contracted and continuous in old shells (PI. XXIV, fig. 15).

 deeply to the aperture. They are markedly gerontic.

Carr Canyon, Huachuca Mountains. In this canyon most or all 

 colonies have the form with rounded periphery, and that with it acutely 

 carinate on the first half of the last whorl. The spire is usually sharply 

 striate obliquely, and the last whorl is frequently striate spirally. The 

 special tendencies of this canyon are most strongly expressed in No. 12. 



7. Carr Canyon, 5,500 feet. Similar to No. 4, Brown Canyon, except 

 that the sutures are less impressed, nearly level, and margined very 

 distinctly above by the keel. In some shells the last whorl is rather 

 distinctly decussate by spirals above. In one specimen the suture is 

 deeply deflexed above, as in the Ramsey Canyon shells. A basal 

 band is sometimes present. 



S. Carr Canyon, 5,500 feet. One specimen is similar to No. 7; the 

 other three, measured below, are more calcareous, resembling No. 2, 

 but the whorl is deflexed anteriorly (PI. XXIV, figs. 21, 22, 23). In

 This lot is dwarfed, about the size of 0. s. concentrota. 



12. Another lot from Carr Canyon, altitude not stated, contains 

 whitish bandless shells and brownish ones, uniform or banded like 

 No. 7. One is carinated to the aperture and all are keeled in 

 front. The sculpture consists of fine, sharp rib-striae on the spire, 

 and when fresh, young shells show cuticular laminae on the costulse, 

 larger at intervals and at the periphery. The base has a similar sculp- 

 ture. The last whorl is spirally striate above and below. Diam. 21 

 mm. (PL XXV, figs.' 37, 38, 39, 40). 



It may be noted that Dall has reported " a sharply carinated variety " 

 from Tanner's Canyon, Huachuca Mountains (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 

 XIX, p. 335). 



Mr. Ferriss notes that the young are hirsute. This form diverges 

 quite markedly from hiuichucana and to some extent parallels 0. har-

This form stands close to the huachucana series, from which it differs

 ples. There are weak traces of a few coarse, low spirals. Wliorls 4,

Cave Creek Canyon, Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, collected by 

 J. H. Ferriss. Co-types No. 87,011 and 87,146, Coll. A. N. S. P. It 

 lives in a moist situation, in stone talus near the falls of the stream. 



Cuticular processes or "hairs" are generally present on the shells 

 of very young Oreohelices, but in this one alone their development 

 culminates in the adult snail. Their projection at the angle of the 

 whorls of the spire makes the lamellse look continuous over the sutures. 

 When denuded the shell is sharply striate, with some ill-defined spirals 

 marking the positions of the more prominent cuticular wreaths. 

 Besides those described above, there are some minor and variable 

 spirals on the most perfect specimens. 



The processes are very efficient as gatherers of soil, \^•hich is probably 

 glued on by the mucous of the animal, as usual. In the general plan 

 of ornamentation, this bearded Oreohelix is not unlike Polygyra {Steno- 

 trema) pilshryi Ferriss. 



By its tricuspid central and bicuspid lateral teeth, as well as by the 

 general form of the shell, 0. harbata recalls 0. he7nphiUi, especially 

 when denuded of the "beard." The embryonic sculpture is not very 

 unlike some forms of hemphilli, but it most resembles that of 0. s. 

 socorroensis, though a little coarser. The insertion of the penis retrac- 

 tor solely on the epiphallus is like Radiocenirum, and unlike any of the 

 typical Oreohelices. 



The foot of 0. harhata is small, slate-blackish above, and finely granu- 

 lated. No genital furrow is discernible, but there is a pair of dorsal 

 grooves. The tail is flattened and pale above. The mantle edge is 

 very thick and fleshy. 



The genitalia of one of the types are figured (PI. XIX, fig. 5). The 

 penis resembles that of *S. strigosa huachucana, the lower half being 

 much swollen, the upper half smaller and cylindric. Internally the 

 larger portion has 4 or 5 large and some smaller longitudinal folds, the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 281 



upper part is densely papillose inside. The epiphallus bears the penis- 

 retractor muscle, some distance from its base, and the vas deferens 

 enters centrally at the end. The duct of the spermatheca is some- 

 what swollen basally. The uterus contained neither eggs nor 

 embryos, the specimens having been collected in February. 



The radula (PL XXII, fig. 6) has 23.1.23 teeth. The mesocones are 

 long, and all the teeth have well-developed cdocones. The marginal teeth 

 are bicuspid as usual, the cusps unsplit. 



Oreohelix yavapai n. sp. PI. XXV, fig. 53. 



Shell thin, whitish more or less stained with brown, with a faint brown 

 band above and another close below^ the periphery. The small periph- 

 eral keel extends to the aperture, but is pinched up less than in neo-

 flattened. Embryo of 2^ whorls, the first nearly smooth, convex, the 

 next more flattened, finely, densely striate obliquelj^ and very strongly 

 striate and ribbed spirally. At the end of the embryonic stage this spiral 

 scidpture abruptly stops , and is succeeded by sharp oblique striation which 

 becomes cut by a few spiral lines. On the last whorl there are more 

 spirals, usually emphasized as series of granules or pits upon the oblique 

 striae (indicating cuticular processes in perfectly fresh shells). Wliorls 

 about 5J, the last hardly descending in front. The umbilicus is ample, 

 as in 0. y. neomexicana. Aperture oblique, rounded, with thin lip.

Dr. R. E. C. Stearns reported a form probably identical with 0.

 (Patula strigosa Old., Nautilus, VI, May, 1892, p. 1; Proc. U. S. Nat.

The embryonic young shells, 2 mm. diameter with 2-^- whorls, are 

 acutely carinatc (PI. XI, fig. 13). 



This species differs from 0. strigosa in the form of the shell, which is 

 more like 0. hemphilli, and by the diminutive penis, while the epi- 

 phallus is longer in proportion than in forms of strigosa I have exam-

ined ; it differs from 0. y. neomexicana chiefly by the stronger spiral 

 sculpture of tho embryonic shell and the abrupt change in sculpture at 

 the inception of the neanic growth. The same differences and the wider 

 umbilicus separate it from the northern 0. hemphilli, which, moreover, 

 differs by its dentition, as indicated below under 0. y. neomexicana. 



The penis (PI. XIX, fig. 7) resembles that of 0. y. neomexicana 

 except that it is larger, and the vas deferens enters the epiphallus 

 centrally at the apex. There were 10 embryos in the uterus, each 

 half enveloped in its podocyst. 



The jaw has longitudinal and vertical striae. The radula (PI. XXII, 

 figs. 7) has 26.1.26 teeth, those in the middle unicuspid; the ectocone 

 distinctly appearing on the sixth. Marginal teeth bicuspid, the cusps 

 unsplit.

 bryonic whorls, w^hich are more impressed near the periphery, and by 

 the more ample umbilicus ; but it differs chiefly by the unicuspid teeth 

 of the median part of the radula, those teeth in 0. hemphilli having well-

I have partially examine 1 the internal anatomy of one of the speci- 

 mens from Beiilah. The penis (PI. XIX, fig. 9) is bent in the middle, 

 the lower half a little swollen, with muscular walls, the upper half 

 slightly smaller, softer. There is a very small apical papilla, and the 

 retractor muscle is inserted at the apex of the penis and root of the 

 epiphallus. The epijshallus is large, shorter than the penis, and the 

 vas deferens enters at the side, not the center of the apex. 



The radula has 19.1.19 teeth, similar to those of 0. yavapai. On the 

 fifth or sixth teeth the ectocone is developed. Marginals bicuspid, as 

 usual. 



Subgenus RADIOCENTRUM nov. 



Oreohelices with an embryonic shell of H radially ribbed whorls,

 Penis rather short, with a hollow dilation at the distal end. Epiphallus

 Type 0. chiricahuana Pils. 



This group differs from Orcohelix by the smaller number of embryonic 

 whorls and their different sculpture, and in the somewhat different 

 structure of the penis. It includes at present three species: 0. chiri- 

 cahuana, 0. clappi and 0. avalonensis. 



The genitalia are similar in the two species examined, the only 

 difference being in the shape of the distal end of the penis, and in the 

 absolute dimensions. The pallial organs of 0. clappi do not differ from 

 those described above for Oreohelix strigosa.

 else on the mountain." 



This is a very distinct little species, closely related to 0. avalonensis 

 Hemphill of Santa Catalina Island, California, which has an apex of 

 the same type. 0. avalonensis differs, however, b}^ its conspicuously 

 decussate surface, wider last whorl and larger aperture, and it has a 

 half whorl less. It is figured for comparison, PI. XI, figs. 4, 5, 6, 7. 

 The umbilicus is about equal in the two species. 



0. chiricahuana differs conspicuously from 0. yavapai and 0. y. 

 neomexicana by its peculiar apical sculpture, etc. 



The genitalia are figured (PL XIX, fig. 4). The penis is cylindric, a 

 little flattened and protruding on one side at the distal end. The epi- 

 phallus is longer than the penis, club-shaped, the retractor inserted 

 upon it not far from its base. The lower part of the spermatheca duct 

 is enlarged and muscular. The lengths of the organs are as follows: 

 penis 4, epiphallus 4.7, vagina 3.5, spermatheca and duct 7.5 mm. The 

 foot is scarcely granulose, the integument smoothish, tessellated in 

 rather coarse pattern with blackish or gray spots. No genital furrow 

 is visible. The mantle edge is thin. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 24) is striate, somewhat less arcuate than 

 that of 0. clappi. 



The radula (PI. XXII, figs. 10, 11) has 26.1.26 teeth. They are 

 rather shorter than usual in Oreohelix. The central and lateral teeth 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 285 



have well-developed cctocones. The marginal teeth are bicuspid, as 

 usual in Oreohelix, but the inner cusp is split.

The smoothish integument is blackish on the head and tail, and 

 darker toward the foot margins, elsewhere tessellated with large poly- 

 gonal gray pigment spots. Sole cream colored. There are two irregu- 

 lar dorsal grooves. 



The kidney, 6.3 mm. long, is a thin-walled sack, its lumen large, 

 with strongly corrugated walls. The pericardium is fully 4 mm. long. 



The reproductive system (PI. XIX, fig. 8) resembles that of 0. chiri- 

 cahuana. The rather slender cylindric penis is enlarged at the summit, 

 the protuberance on the upper side (in the figure) hollow. The epi- 

 phallus enters through a very small acorn-shaped papilla. The walls 

 of the penis are thin, with a minute oblique corrugation meeting V-like 

 on one side. The penis measures 7, epiphallus 7, vagina 6, sperma- 

 theca and duct 13 mm. long. The penis retractor is inserted about 1.5 

 mm. from the base of the epiphallus. 



The jaw (PI. XXIII, fig. 26) is arcuate and striate vertically. 



The radula (PI. XXII, fig. 4) has about 29.1.29 teeth, of the general 

 form usual in Oreohelix. There are rudimentary ectocones on the 

 central teeth, at least where they are unworn. The laterals have simi- 

 lar outer cutting points. The marginal teeth are bicuspid. In general, 

 the teeth are between the unicuspid type and that with developed 

 ectocones.

MOLLUSCA OF FLINT AND CAROLINE ISLANDS, IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND EDWARD G. VANATTA. 



The species recorded below were collected by Mr. C. D. Voy, a Cali- 

 fornian naturalist, in the year 1875, in the course of a voyage from 

 Honolulu through Polynesia to Sydney, New Soutn Wales, Australia. 

 Somewhat extensive series of mollusks, Crustacea and echinoderms 

 were also taken in the Marquesas, Society Islands, Rurutu Island of 

 the Austral group, etc. These collections were acquired by the late 

 Prof. E. D. Cope, and remained unopened in the original parcels until 

 presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1901 by Mrs. Annie 

 P. Cope. 



Most of the island groups represented in Yoy's collection have been 

 more or less exploited by other naturalists, particularly Garrett, Pease 

 and the Godeffroy brothers; but so far as we know, no mollusks have 

 been reported from Caroline and Flint Islands. Although the collec- 

 tion from these places is not extensive, we have thought it worth while 

 on this account to put the facts on record. The only land animals 

 taken on the two islands were the widely distributed Birgus latro and 

 Truncatella valida. 



Flint Island lies 11° 25' 43" S., 151° 48' W., and Caroline Island is 

 10° S., 150° 14' 30" W. They are small, isolated, uninhabited islets, 

 lying north of the Society group, in the central Pacific.

 which is regularly bridged across by thin lamellae dividing it into a 

 series of pits; which at the last whorl penetrate through to the umbili-

convex, roughened by two \JR:7^ 



circles of tubercles, lamellose- 



tuberculate at the edge of the umbilicus. A large spiral cord revolves 

 within the umbilicus; near its lower termination it has a tooth, beyond 

 which it is continuous with the basal lip. The aperture is oblique, 

 circular, the outer lip being expanded in a scalloped varix with five 

 shallow pits on its face.

This large and beautifully sculptured Liotia is related to L. crenata 

 Kiener.^ Compared with specimens of that species in the collection 

 of the Academy, L. voyi is larger and more roughly sculptured, and it 

 wholly lacks the minute sculpture of fine, even strise in the intervals 

 and pits of the coarser sculpture, which is characteristic of Kiener's 

 species. The septa between the peripheral keels are straight in L. voyi, 

 but strongly curved in L. crenata. 



L. crenata was very imperfectly described by Kiener, and his dimen- 

 sions are entirely wrong. It is doubtful whether Reeve's figure, copied 

 by Tryon, represents the true crenata, which is, we think, rather rare.

ANEW SPECIES OF SEA-MOUSE (APHRODITA HASTATA) FROM EASTERN 



MASSACHUSETTS. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



The common European sea-mouse (Aphrodita aculeata) has been so 

 frequently and so widely reported from the American Atlantic coast, 

 while none of the writers on our annelids have reported any other 

 species, that the identity of the species occurring on the two sides of 

 the Atlantic has been taken as established. It was, therefore, with 

 genuine surprise that I found, while prejmring a description from 

 Wood's Hole specimens for a report on the annelids of that region, 

 certain obvious points of difference between these and A. aculeata as 

 described by European writers. Since returning to Philadelphia a 

 more thorough examination of the literature and a detailed comparison 

 of specimens in the collection of this Academy with those belonging 

 to the U. S. F. C. laboratory at Wood's Hole, kindly sent to me by Mr. 

 Vinal Edwards, and two specimens of A. aculeata from the neighbor- 

 hood of Helgoland, for the opportunity of studying which I am indebted 

 to Dr. W. McM. Woodworth, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 

 have doubly convinced me of the wide distinction between the species 

 common in the deeper waters of the open sea off the Wood's Hole region 

 and the European species. This does not, of course, exclude the possi- 

 bility of the occurrence of the true A. aculeata also on our coast, yet 

 the few notes furnished by Prof. Verrill in his Report on the Inverte- 

 brates of Vineyard Sound lead to the belief that the species therein 

 recorded as A. aculeata is the one herein described, which it seems 

 probable is the onty one occurring south of Cape Cod.^ 



A. hastata is really less closely related to A. aculeata than to other 

 species of the genus and probably finds its nearest ally in A. japonica 

 Maren., which is widely distributed in the northern Pacific, From 

 that species it differs in having the notopodial setae free from the felt 

 and in the decidedly smaller number of neuropodial setae, which also 

 lack the terminal pilosit}^ in all of those examined. 



* Mr. James E. Benedict writes me that Prof. Verrill has informed him that 

 two species of Aphrodita are found on our coasts. Owing to the illness of Miss 

 Bush, to whom their discrimination is said to be due, I have been unable to 

 secure further information. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 



From A. aculeata it departs in many and striking characters. Per- 

 haps the most important is the altogether different form of the large 

 notopodial spines. In the former they are acute, rigid needles whose 

 points project stiffly a short distance above the felt, and are capable of 

 inflicting ciiiite painful wounds. In the latter they curve over the back 

 to or beyond the middle line and are soft, flexible but friable, and ter- 

 minate in acute and hooked tips. It is interesting to note that 

 Mcintosh states that .the young of A. aculeata possess setse of this sort, 

 which are later replaced by the acute spines. But A. hastata and sev- 

 eral other species retain the more primitive form throughout life, unless, 

 of course, as frequently happens, they are accidentally injured. In 

 A. aculeata the number of neuropodial setae is constantly greater in 

 the middle and ventral rows and sometimes greater in the dorsal row, 

 and they are stouter, less acute and differ otherwise in form. The 

 lateral fringe of hairs is brilliant green in A. aculeata, pearl color or 

 reddish in A. hastata, and there are other minor differences. A dissec- 

 tion of a single example of A. hastata mdica,tes identity in the internal 

 anatomy of the two species. The complete description follows: 

 Aphrodita hastata sp- nov. 



The size is large, examples of 125 mm. long and 40 mm. in maximum 

 breadth at somite XII, exclusive of the setae, being common, though 

 none equalling the maximum size of A. aculeata has been seen. Exam- 

 ples of 70 to 125 mm. have 40 or 41 somites, the last 15 or so being very 

 small and comprising not more than one-eighth of the total length. 



As in A. aculeata, the form is robust and strongly arched in the ante- 

 rior half, the last fourth becoming slender and tapering rapidly in both 

 planes. The ventral surface is relatively smooth and pale, the brown- 

 ish spherical papillae being few in number but increasing toward the 

 sides and becoming numerous on the dorsal, anterior and posterior 

 surfaces of the parapodia. Hidden, of course, beneath the dorsal felt 

 are 15 pairs of elytra and the dorsal fimbriated organs, both arranged 

 as in ^. aculeata. 



The prostomium is orbicular obovate; the greatest width, which lies 

 near the anterior border, is about equal to the length and the posterior 

 half tapers rapidly to a width of about one-third the maximum. The 

 two minute, closely approximated eyes on each side are placed just 

 anterior to the greatest breadth of the prostomium and separated by a 

 wide median interspace. Although apparently quite variable the facial 

 tubercle is nearly always considerably shorter than the prostomium, 

 strongly compressed below, broad and usually with a median groove 

 above. While the usual spherical papilla? stud its surface it is otherwise

smooth and exhibits httle of the nodular character seen in some species. 

 The median tentacle has a total length slightly exceeding the prosto- 

 miiim, of which about one-fourth or more constitutes the strongly 

 clavate basal piece. The style is slender and regularly tapering, and 

 in no case exhibits any trace of the club-shaped extremity figured by 

 Mcintosh for A. aculeata. The palpi are from six to eight times as long 

 as the prostomium and nearly twice as long as the first parapodium 

 and tentacular cirri; in form they are slender and regularly tapering. 

 Nothing peculiar appears in the form or modifications of the para- 

 podia, ^^•hieh resemble those of A. aculeata, though the first pair appear 



to be rather longer, their tips reaching about 

 1^ times the length of the prostomium beyond 

 the latter. The ventral cirri reach to the 

 middle roAv of neuropodial setae, while the 

 dorsal cirri extend fully one-third of their 

 length beyond the tips of the longest of the 

 latter, being therefore relatively somewhat 

 longer than in A. aculeata. 



The general arrangement of the several 

 forms of setse is that usual in the genus. Of 

 the three series of neuropodials the dorsal 

 invariably contains two, the middle usually 4, 

 and the ventral 8, though 5 may occasionally 

 occur in the middle and 7 to 8 in the ventral 

 series. All of these setae are brown and de- 

 cidedly iridescent, and the slender ones ciuite 

 pale. In the dorsal row both spines (fig. 1) 

 are ^■ery stout, and both terminate in blunt 

 points which probably result from wear, 

 though not a single one of these spines in any 

 of my specimens presented a I'eally acute 

 tip. The middle setae (fig. 2) arc moderately 

 and the ventral (fig. 3) decidedly slender, and 

 both arc similarly formed, with acute attenu- 

 ated tips not preceded l^y any enlargement 

 and not concealed in a pilose coat, though those newly extruded are 

 sheathed. In the dorsal series the anterior seta is frequently stouter, 

 while those in the other two increase in size from before backward. 

 Toward the caudal end, coincidentally with the reduction in size of 

 the parapodia, these setae become more slender, smaller and fewer, 

 and on the last 7 or 8 parapodia are altogether wanting.

From the lower side of the notopodial tubercle arises a tuft of iri- 

 descent hairs which spring from a curved line reaching from the anterior 

 margin of the tubercle upward and backward to the base of the noto- 

 podial cirrus, which occupies a posterior position. These capillary 

 setas spread in a flowing plume outward, backward and upward, cover- 

 ing the sides of the body and the neuropodia. Compared with the cor- 

 responding structures in A. aculeata they present numerous differences- 

 In the first place they are fewer, about one-third longer and spread 

 more widely, irregularly and in greater disorder from the sides. In our 

 species they are much softer and less harsh and rigid— a difference 

 which becomes especially evident if they are brushed forward and 

 released, when those of A. aculeata spring quickly back to position, 

 while those of A. hastata return slowy and gently. But the most strik- 

 ing difference is in color, ours being far less brilliant than the European 

 species. Wlien placed in corresponding positions with reference to the 

 light and the observer's eye, namely, wdth the caudal 

 end toward the light and the head toward and below 

 the observer, the marginal hairs of A. aculeata appear 

 of a beautiful burnished golden green color, rich golden 

 predominating toward the base and a fine viridian 

 green in the outer half, the intensity of the display 

 being enhanced by the great number and relatively 

 compact arrangement of the hairs, while the general 

 effect of those of A. hastata varies from a pearl color to 

 a richer bronzy red in different individuals. In the 

 paler variety the hairs appear purplish-blue, toward 

 the base changing to a delicate red, and toward the tip 

 to a varied mixture of reddish-purple and bluish-green 

 which differs as the glancing hght strikes particular 

 hairs at different angles. Owing to the more open, 

 spreading arrangement of the hairs in our species this 

 dispersal of the colors is more evident. When viewed 

 at other angles or by transmitted light the distribution 

 of colors differs. 



The two tufts of large notopodial spines arise, as 

 in most species, one just anterior to the dorsal cirrus, 

 the other, separated by a short interval, higher on 

 the dorsum. The first consists of about 4 and the 

 second of about 6 or 7 long, curved, soft, coarse and 

 brownish setae which, after perforating the dorsal felt, e\irve, most 

 of them perfectly free from and above the latter, caudad and

mediad, often crossing those of the opposite side and many of them 

 attaining a length in excess of the greatest width of the body. At 

 the base they are very coarse, but taper gradually to the tip, which 

 is recurved as an acutely pointed hook (fig. 4). Tn section they 

 are often flattened and seldom perfectly circular. The interior consists 

 of a core of soft colorless fibres which are enclosed in a firmer and 

 brittle sheath or shell of a more or less iridescent brown color. It is to 

 this structure that these spines owe their softness and fragileness, 

 the latter quality being so marked that large specimens almost invaria- 

 bly have all of them broken short off above the felt, leaving the latter 

 exposed over the entire median expanse of the back, and giving to 

 this species an aspect which has natui-ally led to its identification with 

 A. aculeata. 



The felt fibres arise in three tufts, one ventral, one between and 

 one dorsal to the dorsal setse bundles. In large specimens the felt 

 forms a uniform continuous layer nearly -J- in. thick and of a smooth, 

 compact texture. The fibres appear to be finer than in the two 

 specimens of A. aculeata available for comparison. They also have less 

 color, many of them being altogether dull and colorless while others 

 exhibit a slight greenish iridescence. 



The type is No. 20, Collection Acad. Nat. Sci., and was taken by 

 Dr. Benjamin Sharp on the beach at Nantucket after a storm. About 

 a dozen other specimens have been examined, coming partly from the 

 game place, partly from the collections of Mr. Vinal Edwards on No- 

 man's Land and from dredgings of the U. S. F. C. steamer Fish Hawk 

 in the deeper waters off the same region. The species has not been 

 taken in the course of the recent extensive dredgings of the Fish Hawk 

 and Phalarope, either in Vineyard Sound, Nantucket Sound, or Buz- 

 zard's Bay. Occasionally, it is brought up in lobster pots set in the 

 deeper waters off Noman's Land, and it is probably this species which 

 is said to be sometimes thrown up in great numbers during heavy 

 storms on the shores of Block Island.

BY CYRUS R. CROSBY. 



The larger part of the material upon which the notes included in 

 this paper are based is in the collection of Cornell University. This 

 collection includes, in addition to the general collection of the Univer- 

 sity, the following special collections : Many of the specimens studied 

 by Nathan Banks in the preparation of "The Spider Fauna of the 

 Upper Cayuga Lake Basin" {Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1892); a 

 collection purchased by the Entomological Department of Cornell 

 University of Dr. William Fox; a collection made by Prof. J. H. Corn- 

 stock in the Southern States, and a collection made by the writer 

 chiefly near Ithaca, New York. The sequence of genera, with one 

 exception, is that of Simon's Histoire Naturelle des Araignees. As 

 many of the original descriptions are very brief, I have given in the 

 notes such measurements and facts as may be of value in determining 

 the generic position of the species. The types of the new species are 

 in the Cornell University collection. 



I wish to thank Prof. Comstock, under whose direction this paper 

 was prepared, for the opportunity of using the University collection 

 and for many favors and valuable suggestions. I am under obliga- 

 tions to Dr. A. D. MacGillivray and Dr. W. A. Riley for kindly encour- 

 agement and many specimens; to Mr. J. H. Emerton for the loan of 

 specimens; to Dr. William Fox for the loan to the Department of 

 Entomology of Cornell University of parts of types of his species of 

 Ceraticelus; to Mr. P. B. Powell for specimens from California; and 

 to many others for specimens of which no record was made.

II. Notes and Descriptions of New Species. 

 In the following notes all measurements are given in millimeters. 

 In determining the curvature of the rows of eyes, the posterior row is 

 viewed from above and the anterior from before. 



CERATINELLA Em. 



Emerton {Trans. Conn. Ac., VI, p. 32) proposed the name Ceratinella 

 for the genus Ceratina Menge, preoccupied. The species described by 

 Emerton under this name, with the exception of C. hrunnea Em., did 

 not belong to Menge's genus Ceratina, type C. hrevis Wid. For these 

 species E. Simon {Ar. Fr., V, p. 595) proposed the name Ceraticelus, 

 and later {Hist. Nat. Ar., I, p. 651) designated C. fissiceps Cambr. as

its type. In 1893 Banks {Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc, I, p. 130), considering 

 that Emerton did not propose Ceratinella to replace Ceratina, but rather 

 to designate the species which he placed under it, proposed Ceratinodes 

 for Menge's genus, and has since retained the name Ceratinella for the 

 American species. 



Ceratinella is easily distinguished from Ceraticelus by the double 

 curve in the claw of the chelicerse.

 their diameter, and from the lateral by their radius; anterior eyes in a 

 straight line, the median eyes slightly smaller than the lateral, sub- 

 contiguous but separated from the lateral by two-thirds their diameter. 

 Median ocular area a little wider than long. Clypeus narrower than 

 ocular area. Claw of chelicerae ciu'ved twice, first concave and then 

 convex without. 



CERATICELUS E. Sim. 



Banks {Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc, I, p. 130) proposed the genus Idionella 

 for C. formosa Banks, based on the position of the dorsal sclerite of the 

 abdomen, a character of less than specific value in some species of the 

 group. In certain species of the group this sclerite is wholly lacking 

 in some individuals, while strongly developed in others of the same sex. 



The figures and notes on the species described by Fox are from 

 mounts of male palpi taken from the type specimens.

 scutiger E. Sim., its type, yet it so closely agrees with it in all essential

 armed with a median longitudinal series of four long curved hairs ; one 

 hair back of each posterior median eye; eye area thinly clothed with 

 short hairs. Posterior eyes in a straight line, the median eyes a little

 much longer than wide. Clypeus narrow, plane and retreating; ster- 

 num broad, very wide behind between the posterior coxse, light brown 

 near the center and very dark near the edge, slightly rugose; endites 

 yellow brown, labium darker. Abdomen completely covered above by 

 a yellowish-brown sclerite; below the large epigastric sclerite surrounds 

 the pedicle and is only narrowly separated from the dorsal sclerite 

 except behind; no inframamillary sclerite present; soft parts gray. 

 Legs and palpus very light yellow. Tibia of palpus armed above at 

 tip with a short incurved tooth on the iaside and with a broad blunt 

 projection on the outside, armed below with a short rather blunt tooth.

EXECHOPHYSIS. 



The following species is placed here with considerable doubt. There 

 is great variation in the amount of chitinization of the dorsal sclerite 

 of the abdomen, and also to a less degree in the form of the lobes of the 

 head. It differs markedly from Ceraticelus in the form of the male 

 palpus.

Prosopotheca formosa Banks. 



Banks {Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc, I, p. 125) has stated that Tmeticus 

 luxuosus Banks is the male of Lophocarenum venustum Banks. I have 

 compared the types of Lophocarenum venustum and Cornicularia for- 

 mosa Banks and feel sure they are the same species. This species is 

 related to Erigone by the apophysis on the patella of the palpus. It 

 lacks, however, the teeth on the margin of the cephalothorax and outer 

 margin of the chelicerae and its eyes are not arranged as in that genus. 

 In the form of the sternum and cephalothorax it is related to Proso- 

 potheca, but the auditory hair of the fourth metatarsus is on the distal 

 fourth.

 coxae. 



Endites like the stermma, lighter near the tip. Abdomen dark gray 

 with two oval coalescent lighter spots on the front part and a light area 

 near the tip, under side dark gray with a reddish-yellow transverse 

 quadrangular band midway between the spinnerets and the epigynum. 

 Legs light yellow darkened at base; on the first pair the dark marking 

 extends to near the end of the femur, on the second to the middle, on 

 the third only a short distance and is much lighter. On the fourth 

 pair there is a small dark spot on the under side of the base of the femur. 

 Spines weak and rather short. No auditory hair on fourth metatarsus. 



Palpus dark brown, short and thick; tip of tibia as thick* as patella 

 is long, tarsus robust, clothed with numerous weak spines. 



I have a male of this species lacking one molt of adult, taken at 

 Ithaca, New York, August, 1904, and another from Columbia, Missouri, 

 October, 1904. The tibia of the palpus shows a dorsal apophysis and 

 the yellow band on the ventral aspect of the abdomen is very distinct. 

 The head is nearly normal. Clypeus narrow and retreating.

 separated from the lateral by two-thirds their diameter. Median 

 ocular area a little longer than wide. Clypeus a little wider than ocular 

 area. 



This species has been referred with doubt to this genus by Simon. It 

 is related to TypJiochrcestus in having the posterior median eyes nearer 

 each other than to the lateral. This arrangement, however, may be 

 the result of the abnormal development of the head in the male. In 

 the absence of female specimens, by which alone this point could be 

 decided, I leave it doubtfully in Trachelocamptus. 



HYPOMMA. 



' Dicyphus Menge, preoccupied. 



I have been unable to examine specimens of the species included in 

 this genus. Dicyphus was founded by Menge (Prevss. Spirm., p. 221, 

 1869) for three species in the following order, tumidus, cilunculus and 

 bicuspidatus, without indicating the type. In 1884 Simon (Ar. Fr., V, 

 p. 546) designated tumidus ( = hitubercidotus) as the type. Dahl 

 (Monographie der Erigonc-Arten, p. 87, 1886) proposed the genus 

 Hypomma for bifrons Blackw. and bituberculatus Wid., without indi- 

 cating the type. Chyzer and Kulczynski (Ar. Hung., pp. 99, 100) seem 

 to consider bituberculatus as the type of Hypomma and cornutus as 

 the type of Dicyphus. As Dicyphus is preoccupied in the Hemiptera 

 (Fieber, Wien. Ent. Monats., II, p. 327, 1858) it is necessary to use 

 the next oldest name applied to that group of species. This seems 

 to be Hypomma. Simon has placed bituberculatus under Gonatium.

SENILITY AMONG GASTROPODS 



by burnett smith. 



Introduction. 

 The critical study of the development of Gastropod shell ornamen- 

 tation has, until recent years, attracted the attention of few scientists 

 in the United States. In Europe as early as 1889 Koken^ made a 

 carefia study of Paleeozoic Gastropods. This was followed m 1896 

 by the Countess von Linden's^ study of the ornamentation and color 

 patterns in Voluta, Strombus and Coyius. In the United States, the 

 first use of gastropod shell characters in the study of phylogeny occurs 

 in the short notes of Heilprin' in 1888, dealing with the phylogeny of 

 Fulgur perversum and Strombus leidyi; and of Ueidy* and Wilcox on 

 the ancestry of Fulgur -perversum. 



In 1900, A. W. Grabau presented a thesis at Harvard University 

 dealing with the phylogeny of Fusus and allied forms. In June, 1902, 

 the writer^ applied the methods of the Countess von Linden to a study 

 of the Fulgurs, and later in the same year A. W. Grabau« published a 

 paper dealing with the general features of gastropod shell development. 

 In 1903 Prof. Grabau^ discussed the phylogenetic relations of the Ful- 

 gurs, and in the following year published an elaborate phylogenetic 

 study of Fusus? 



In most of the above papers there is an attempt made to compare 

 ontogeny with palfEontogeny, dealing, therefore, with both recent and 

 fossil forms. The individuals of species are studied from the earliest

whorls to the latest, and the changes in shell features and ornamenta- 

 tion noted in the individual have been correlated with characters 

 observed in the species of past geologic time. Where phylogenetic trees 

 have been constructed they have been based on the principle that the 

 mdividual in its development repeats, in its early stages, shell features 

 which are found in the adult individuals of its ancestors. The authors 

 have, for the most part, followed the principles applied and the laws 

 formulated by Hyatt in his classic studies of the Cephalopoda. 



In any phylogenetic study of the gastropod shell, acceleration of 

 the characters plays an important part. With the exception of Fusus 

 and Voluta, most of the genera studied have been rather highly spe- 

 cialized and accelerated types like Fulgur and Strotnbus. In such forms 

 many of the stages have been hurried back into the earlv whorls 

 slurred over or lost. " ' 



The writer feels that a detailed study of the shell features in some 

 species of Volutilithes, as Volutilithes petrosus of the American Eocene 

 may add to our knowledge of the normal order in which such features 

 are evolved. Several species of Volutilithes go through quite a number of 

 stages of development in ornamentation, and there is little acceleration. 

 Each stage, of course, does not necessarily represent an adult ancestor, 

 for at present it is not known how much unequal acceleration of 

 . ancestral characters has come into play, yet nevertheless the writer 

 feels that here we have a fairly normal and even succession of develop- 

 mental features. 



The occurrence of certain characteristics with considerable con- 

 stancy m the later whorls of many individuals of Volutilithes petrosus 

 has led the author to consider such features in other genera of gastro- 

 pods. These features will be treated in the sections of this paper 

 entitled Senility and Senile Offshoots from Main Ancestral Stems. 

 The results of this later investigation are applied to Fulgur carica, 

 in an endeavor to unravel its ancestry. 



Normal Progressive Development. 

 In recording the characters which occur at different periods in the 

 growth of any gastropod shell it is necessary to be exact; and this 

 frequently results in the use of terms which appear arbitrary. The 

 writer has, throughout this paper, endeavored as far as possible to 

 apply the terms previously in use. Markings on the outside of the 

 whorl w^hich run parallel or nearly parallel to the suture are described 

 as spiral; while those running across these spirals are described as 

 transverse. The transverse markings which first appear are referred 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



to as transverse ribs, or simply as ribs. When, in later stages, finer 

 transverse markings appear between the ribs, they are described as 

 riblets. Here the term is used principally for convenience, the actual 

 difference between ribs and riblets being one of degree. 



The angle which appears early on the rounded whorl is termed the 

 shoulder angle. On the ribs, especially at the shoulder angle, may 

 occur nodes or tubercles. These, in the early whorls, are mere rounded 

 knobs; but in the later whorls they become larger, higher and sharper, 

 and may therefore be referred to as spines. The writer considers that 

 the difference between the small rounded tubercle of the early whorls 

 and the large, sharp spine of the later whorl is one merely of degree. 

 The word spine is therefore used, throughout this paper, simply in a 

 descriptive sense, and implies no difference from the early tubercle, 

 except that it is larger and sharper. Both are produced by the same 

 fold of the mantle and every gradation between the two is observable. 



As stated in the Introduction, Volutilithes has been chosen as an 

 illustration on account of the normal and even course of its ontogeny. 

 The stages are often very distinct, and frequently are all represented 

 down to the senile condition in the later whorls. In addition, Voluti- 

 lithes petrosus is of unusual interest on account of its individual varia- 

 tion and its division into more or less definite races, which exhibit 

 different stages in the specialization of characters. 



In the early stages of Volutilithes petrosus there is a varying number 

 of smooth rounded whorls; but as a rule there are three or four. 

 The first ornamental feature to appear on the rounded whorl is the 

 transverse rib, which at first is simple (without tubercles) and usually 

 decidedly curved. Soon the simple ribs are followed by uncurved 

 ribs, bearing as a rule two tubercles, but sometimes more than two. 

 One of these tubercles is situated at the suture, the other at the position 

 of the shoulder angle. If more tubercles are present they are below 

 the shoulder angle tubercle. Sometimes the suture tubercle and the 

 shoulder angle tubercle are of the same size; but often they are of 

 unequal size, and then it is usually the suture tubercle which is at first 

 the larger. The suture tubercle, however, soon degenerates and be- 

 comes obsolete, while the shoulder angle tubercle increases in import- 

 ance and by its increase in size and sharpness makes the spine of 

 the later whorls. 



Coincident with or shortly after the appearance of the tubercles on 



the ribs, a more or less well marked shoulder angle develops. As the 



shoulder angle tubercles become larger, sharper and more prominent 



the transverse ribs degenerate. This process begins first above the 



23 




348 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



shoulder angle, where sometimes all trace of the rib has disappeared, 

 when below the angle the rib is still well marked. As a rule, when the 

 tubercles become very high and sharp (spines) the ribs practically 

 disappear. 



When fine spirals cover the early whorls below the shoulder angle, 

 they are apt to disappear near the shoulder angle first in the later 

 adult whorls. As the shell grows, these fine spirals are found in a more 

 and more anterior position, until in old age only a few occur on the 

 branchial siphon. 



This briefly simis up the more important changes which are passed 

 through in the development of most individuals of Volutilithes petr-osus, 

 and many other species of the genus. Many individuals and some races 

 of Volutilithes petrosus pass through further stages of development; 

 but these are all of a gerontic character, and may be now more fittiniily 

 discussed under the following section. 



Senility. 



In widely separated genera of gastropods the writer has observed 

 that similar features are frequently found in the last whorl or in the 

 last few whorls. These features are never followed, in any gastropod, 

 by other and different ones, but are the last ornamental characters 

 which the shell acquires. They are the marks of old age or senility. 

 Many species and even genera and families never exliibit them, for in 

 the Palaeozoic they are rare and in the Mesozoic they are uncommon. 

 In Tertiary and Recent time, however, few large families of gastropods 

 are lacking in senile representatives. These representatives may be 

 genera, species or individuals. 



Individual Senility. — In many species, the vast majority of individ- 

 uals die at the period of mature shell ornamentation. Senile characters 

 are found only in an occasional specimen, which, as a rule, is either a 

 very large old one or else a dwarfed or pathologic individual.^ In indi- 

 vidual senility, the senile features are seldom accelerated to any extent 

 — that is, they are, as a rule, found in the last whorl, or in the latter 

 part of the last whorl. 



Specific Senility. — Often all the individuals of a species will show 

 signs of senility in the last whorl, or in the last few whorls. This 

 senile ornamentation of the species is more apt to be accelerated than 

 the senile ornamentation of the individual ; or, in other words, it occurs 

 earlier in the growth of the shell, 



® A similar condition has been noted by Hyatt for the Cephalopoda: " Biological 

 Relations of the Jurassic Ammonites," Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. XVII, 

 1874, p. 239. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 349 



Generic Senility. — Here all the species of a genus will exhilDit signs 

 of senility, and the generic senility is more accelerated than the specific. 



Similarly, senility may extend to the genera of a family, and if, as 

 is probably the case, the VerinetidcB are senile, we have the characters 

 occurring early in the growth of shell, with the result that the forms 

 comprising the family differ in appearance to a marked degree from the 

 normal gastropod . 



The marks of senility may be conveniently grouped under several 

 heads. Two or three of them have been mentioned by Hyatt, Grabau 

 and other authors, and these are merely noted in the present paper for 

 the sake of completeness. The wi'iter knows of no case in which all 

 of the characters are found together. Frequently only one will indicate 

 that the individual, species or genus has passed its prime, but more 

 often two or more senile characters occur. As old age comes on the 

 marks of senility appear, but not necessarily all at the same time. 

 Usually one character will appear in the growth of the shell slightly 

 ahead of another character. Sometimes one of the senile characters 

 will be much accelerated and become prominent at a comparatively 

 early stage, while the others will be found on the last whorl only. 



The wTiter regards the following as marks of senility : 



1. Passing of the shoulder tubercles or spines into a shoulder keel. 



2. Swelling on the anterior siphon. 



3. Protrusion of the mantle in the region of the anal siphon, produc- 

 ing a smoothing of the preceding whorl by a shelly overgrowth. 



4. Encroachment of the anal siphon upward on the preceding whorl. 



5. Stromboid form to the outer lip of the aperture. 



6. Tendency toward loose coiling. 



7. Irregularity of growi:h lines. 



8. Thickening of the shell. 



9. Tendency to form a smooth and rounded whorl. 



10. Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation. 



1. Passing of the shoulder tubercles or spines into o shoulder keel. — 

 This process is well shown in such forms as Fulgur carica and Voluti- 

 lithes petrosus, where little acceleration has occurred. The change 

 takes place by a shortening of the interval between spine formation, 

 with the result that the spines are nearer each other. The growth lines, 

 on which the spines are situated, are thus brought close together. 

 The spines become lower in height, but longer in a spiral direction, 

 until they fuse together into a continuous ridge, so that the final result 

 of the process is a shoulder keel without definite spines. 



In Fulgur canalicidatum acceleration has thrown the spines back 




350 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



into the early whorls, and they are mere tubercles. Their transforma- 

 tion into a shoulder keel is, however, essentially similar to the change 

 in F. carica. The tubercles become longer in a spiral direction, but 

 lower in height and soon merge into a shoulder keel. 



2, Swelling on the anterior siphon. — In senile individuals and species 

 the mantle, in the region of the anterior or branchial siphon, not infre- 

 quently bulges at a certain point. As the animal grows, this bulging of 

 the mantle produces a swollen ridge in the shell. The long diameter of 

 this swelling runs obliquely to the line of the shoulder angle, and in a 

 more anterior direction. Numerous dissections of Fulgur carica ha\'e 

 failed to show a cause for this mantle swelling. 



The two above marks of senility — that is, the passing of the spines 

 into a shoulder keel, and the swelling on the anterior siphon — are both 

 well shown in old individuals of the Fulgur carica of our New Jersey 

 coast. These two characters, together with a third (the tendency for 

 the anal siphon to encroach upward on the preceding whorl), are the 

 last ornamental features which occur on the oldest individuals. A w^ell- 

 marked sexual dimorphism occurs in this species. The full-grown 

 males are considerably smaller than the full-grown females. The old 

 males and old females show the senile characters above mentioned ; and 

 the difference in the size of the senile individuals of the different sexes 

 furnishes a I'eady method of determ'ning sex without reference to the 

 soft parts. These observations were made on a large series of Fulgur 

 carica}'^ 



3. Protrusion of the mantle in the region of the anal siphon, producing 

 a smoothing of the preceding whorl by -a shelly overgrowth. — This is beauti- 

 fully illustrated by several races of Volutilithes petrosus. In the later 

 whorls the mantle in the region of the anal siphon protrudes and tends 

 to wrap itself aroimd the preceding whorl. In the early stages of the 

 process we have little more than a smoothing of the preceding whorl. 

 The mantle soon passes up over the spines of the preceding whorl, and 

 the shelly deposit becomes thicker and thicker, completely obliterating 

 ornamentation, and making it in many cases extremely difficult to 

 count the whorls. Every stage of the process can be traced in indi- 

 vidual development; while several races make a series from forms in 

 which the mantle has been little protruded to forms in which it has 

 covered in the preceding whorl, obliterating ornamental features. It 

 does not necessarily follow that these races in question make a phylo- 

 genetic succession, but they unquestionably represent stages in the 



1" Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., June, 1902. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA., 351 



development of certain featiu-es. The protrusion of the mantle onto 

 the preceding whorl is often accompanied by an encroachment of the 

 anal siphon upward onto the preceding whorl. 



There is evidently a close relation between the swelling on the 

 anterior siphon and the protrusion of the mantle on the preceding 

 whorl in the region of the anal siphon ; for as the latter feature becomes 

 stronger the former declines. The races of Volulilithes petrosus above 

 mentioned illustrate this fact perfectly. They range from forms with a 

 well-marked swelling to others with no swelling; and in one race with 

 an extreme mantle protrusion there is a depression in place of a swell- 

 ing. As the swelling has been diminishing, there has been a corre- 

 sponding increase in the amount of protrusion of the mantle on the 

 preceding whorl in the region of the anal siphon. 



4. Encroachment of the anal siphon upward on the preceding whorl.— 

 This often accompanies the preceding mark of senility and is evidently 

 produced by the same causes. It is well shown in Volutilithes petrosus 

 and in Fulgur carica, also in Strombus and Aporrhais, where it is accom- 

 panied by the wing-like flaring of the outer lip of the aperture. 



5. Stromhoid form to the outer lip of the aperture. — This is a flaring, 

 wing-like extension of the outer lip of the aperture and is found in 

 Strombus, Aporrhais and a few other forms. In Strombus it is often 

 accompanied by a thickening of the shell, by a bending of the branchial 

 siphon upward or backward, by the encroachment of the anal siphon 

 upward onto the preceding whorl, and by recurrent ornamentation 

 {Strombus leidyi). 



6. Tendency toward loose coiling. — In many gastropods the later 

 whorls are not closely applied against the preceding whorls. In other 

 words, the coiling becomes loose. Ecphora, Ropana and some species 

 of Murex do not show signs of uncoiling until well along in life. In 

 such forms as Vermetus, however, the process is further advanced, and 

 all trace of the original spiral condition is lost at an early date; the 

 shell becoming a mere irregular tube. 



7. Irregularity of growth lines. — In many gastropods {Volutilithes 

 petrosus is a good example) the final senile stages are characterized by 

 a thickening and irregularity of the fine lines of growth. Thi^ charac- 

 ter goes hand in hand with the thickening of the shell, the passing of 

 the spines into a shoulder keel, recm-rent ornamentation, and other 

 senile features. 



8. Thickening of the shell. — This is a character which occurs in the 

 senile stages of manj'- diverse groups of gastropods. It is usually ac- 

 companied by other senile features, and is probably more widely dis- 

 tributed than any other mark of senility. 




352

9. Tendency to jorm a smooth and rounded whorl.- — In many gastro- 

 pods the later whorls tend to become rounded and more or less smooth, 

 losing all ornamental features except growth lines and perhaps also 

 fine spirals. In many individuals and varieties of Fulgur 'pyrum and 

 related forms the shoulder keel stage is followed by a condition in which 

 the whorl is roimded, the shoulder keel becoming fainter and fainter 

 vmtil it is not discernible. In many gastropods this rounded stage is 

 accompanied by a thickening of the shell, but in others the shell actu- 

 ally becomes thinner. As the early whorls of most gastropods are 

 rounded, it is possible that this mark of senility may be regarded as 

 a reciu-rence of features of the same nature as the mark of senility next 

 to be considered.

10. Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation. — -This is a term which 

 may be applied to the discontinuity produced by the repetition, at a 

 later stage, of a style of ornamentation characterizing an earlier stage. 

 Thus spines or tubercles which are found on the early whorls disappear 

 for a few whorls, but are repeated as a secondary series in old age. 

 The development of secondary spines is well shown in Fulgur maximum. 



In most examples of this very variable species and its near relatives 

 the shoulder angle tubercles are soon lost, and only reappear again in 

 the later whorls, where they are spine-like and accompanied by features 

 of extreme senility. Sometimes the arrangement of the shoulder angle 

 spines may be considered as discontinuous, that is, where an occasional 




1905.

353 



spine is met with on a rounded whorl. Here, as above, the condition 

 is accompanied by other senile features. 



Recurrent or discontinuous ornamentation is also met with in the 

 sinistral Fulgurs of the Miocene, in not a few Stromhs, and in some indi- 

 viduals of Volutiliihes dalli. In the last mentioned, the breaks in a 

 particular style of ornamentation may occur early in life, but the shell 

 always shows senile characters in its last whorls. 



Senile Offshoots from Main Ancestral Stems. 



In no group of gastropods are senile offshoots from main lines of 

 descent so well marked as in the Fulgurs. The modern Fulgur carica 

 of our New Jersey coast is a simple, little accelerated type which, 

 however, shows well-defined senile characters in its last whorl. 



In the Yorktown Miocene of North Carolina occiu- certain formg 

 which were described by Conrad as Fulgur striatum. Some of these 

 small forms are undoubtedly the young of Fulgur maximum, as can 

 be seen in the early degeneration of the tubercles, but others whose 

 tubercles increase in size can hardly be distinguished from the young 

 of Fulgur carica. It is from these latter, or from very closely allied 

 forms, that the modern New Jersey Fulgur carica is descended. The 

 main line of the ancestry of Fulgur carica may be represented as 

 follows : 



This has been a slow and even evolution, marked by increase in size, 

 stronger and continuous spine development, and finally in the old indi- 

 viduals of Fulgur carica by the appearance of the senile characters 

 in the last whorl, which have already been referred to. 



In the Yorktown Miocene the Fulgur maximum branch Was evolved. 

 As can be seen by examining the young Fulgur maximum, it owes its 

 ancestry to the ancestral Fulgur carica. It differs from this form, 

 however, in the early degeneration of the shoulder angle tubercles — 

 a tendency which soon results in a rounded, lirate and relatively thin 

 whorl. This spineless condition continues for some time, but in the 

 later whorls secondary spines appear. This recurrent ornamentation 

 is accompanied by shell thickening, encroachment upward of the anal

siphon on the preceding whorl, and the sweUing on the anterior siphon 

 — all senile features. This is the method by which most of the indi- 

 A'idiials recognized as Fulgur maximum have been evolved. Some- 

 times, however, recurrent ornamentation is only slightly marked, the 

 spines occurring at long intervals on the rounded whorls. 



The whole assemblage shows every indication of being a senile off- 

 shoot. Every large individual shows senile characters. The main 

 Fulgur maximum branch (including the forms described as F. maxi- 

 mum, F. tritonis, F. filosum) becomes extinct at the end of the Miocene. 



Shortly after the divergence of the Fulgur maximum branch from the 

 main Fulgur carica stem, a series of forms with rounded whorls diverged 

 from the maximum stock. Their young are much like the young 

 of Fulgur maximum, but the tubercles degenerate at a more early 

 period. This short tubercled stage Ls followed by thin, rounded, spine- 

 less whorls in the vast majority of individuals, resulting in the form 

 known as Fulgur rapum. A few senile individuals of Fulgur rapum 

 exhibit a thickening of the last whorl, and recurrent or discontinuous 

 ornamentation, in the shape of secondary spines. Fulgur rapum 

 becomes extinct with the end of the Pliocene. 



In Pliocene or Recent times a branch has been evolved from the 

 Fulgur carica main stem which has resulted in such forms as Fulgur 

 eliceans. These are senile and exhibit an acceleration of characters 

 accompanied by very high spines. These spines are not as numerous 

 as in Fulgur carica. They sometimes tend to pass into a shoulder keel, 

 though less often than in Fulgur carica. In other respects, however, 

 these forms show extreme senility — the swelling on the anterior siphon 

 is very large, the shell is very heavy and the anal siphon encroaches 

 upward. 



The phylogeny of Fulgur carica and allied forms may be represented 

 as follows:

356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



From the above study the writer is led to beUeve that there are two 

 modes in which evohitional features may develop. First, they may 

 develop slowly and evenly in the growth of the individual (ontogeny), 

 and in the evolution of the race in geologic time (palseontogeny ) . 

 Such forms are stable and persist for long periods of time. Second, 

 the same evolutional features may develop in the same order, but more 

 rapidly; one feature following another in quick succession in the on- 

 togeny and paltEontogeny. Such forms are apt to be short lived, soon 

 becoming senile and dying out. Where the rate of development of 

 evolutional features is rapid, we find that some features are slurred 

 over; while other features may be more exaggerated than the corre- 

 sponding features in the forms whose rate of development of characters 

 is slow. Of course acceleration, or the throwing back of characters into 

 the ontogeny, is a natural result of an increased evolutional rate. 



Further, we cannot escape the conclusion that there are times in the 

 evolution of a group of organisms (palseontogeny) which might be 

 termed periods of pliancy. In these the simple, generalized members 

 of the main ancestral stem can be easily moulded. At such periods of 

 pliancy we may expect to find, first, forms which follow out the suc- 

 cession of developmental features, as in the main stock, but at a more 

 rapid rate, becoming senile and extinct; and second, forms which 

 acquire characters of a more or less permanent nature, and which do 

 not go through the same succession of developmental features which 

 is found in the main ancestral stock. These latter forms make new 

 stocks, or, in other words, they go to form new species, genera, etc. 



Therefore, at every period of pliancy in a stock we have, on the one 

 hand, new species and, on the other, senile offshoots. In the forms 

 above considered, that is, the Fulgurs, the numerous senile offshoots 

 far outnumber the few but persistent stable forms. The following 

 diagram may be used :

Adventitious Senility. 



An acceleration of shell characters, produced by accident or by patho- 

 logic conditions, occm-s in species of widely separated groups of gastro- 

 pods. Hyatt^^ observed that " a wound and its results, whatever they 

 may be, .... is primarily a severe shock to the system which lays 

 additional biudens upon the powers of grow^th, and is usually followed, 

 if severe, by retrogressive metamorphoses, or premature old age."

have been subjected to breakage, often exhibit a sudden and sharp 

 development of senile features. The shell gets heavy, the growth lines 

 become irregular, and the spines tend to pass into a shoulder keel. 



An individual of Ecphora quadricostata, collected by the writer from 

 the Maryland Miocene, exhibits acceleration produced by accident 

 very clearly. The accident occurred to the shell during the develop- 

 ment of the third whorl. From this point on the rate of the develop- 

 ment of later shell features increases, and is much more rapid than in 

 normal individuals. The individual in question never became mature, 

 only attaining five whorls. A normal specimen with this number of 

 whorls has practically no indication of loose coiling in the region of the 

 colimiella, and the spiral folds are simple. The abnormal individual 

 in question shows plainly a loose coiling in the columella region, and 

 the spiral folds approximate those of more mature individuals. Toose 

 coiling is, as a rule, not marked in normal individuals of this species 

 imtil the seventh or eighth whorl. 



A specimen of Fulgur canaliculatwn collected at Longport, New 

 Jersey, exhibits well the acceleration of characters produced by break- 

 age in the shell. ^^ In the canaliculate Fulgurs the transversely ril^bed 

 condition occurs very early, and is followed by a few angular whorls, 

 bearing tubercles on the shoulder angle. These tubercles soon pass 

 into a shoulder keel, and this in turn disappears, and leaves the whorl 

 rounded, in the more accelerated forms, such as Fulgur pyrum. 



Fulgur canaliculatum, however, never entirely loses the shoulder keel, 

 which marks its last stage of development. In the specimen under 

 consideration the accident occurred when the shell was young, on an 

 angular whorl having the tubercles so characteristic of the early stages 

 of Fulgur canaliculatum. After the break the shoulder angle is not 

 reproduced, but the whorls continue to the aperture of a shape much 

 as in Fulgur pyrum. Just after the break there is, apparently, an 

 attempt to reproduce the tubercles on the rounded surface of the whorl. 

 This attempt was, however, unsuccessful, and the whorl continued 

 smooth. An examination of the soft parts showed the specimen to 

 be identical with normal male individuals of the species, except that 

 the shoulder angle is not present on the mantle. No peculiarity in the 

 mantle edge or other soft parts could be detected which would account 

 for the change in shell ornamentation. 



The acceleration in this case has caused the dropping out of that 

 marked character of the later whorls of the species, namely, the un-

tnbercled shoulder keel. On the other hand, it has introduced a senUe 

 character which occurs normally in a near relative (if not an actual 

 descendant) of Fulgur canaliculatum, namely, Fulgur pijrum}^ 



Summary. 



In most Mesozoic and Cenozoic gastropods, changes in ornamentation 

 occur in going from the earlier to the later whorls. A normal succession 

 of developmental changes may be observed, which varies little in 

 widely separated groups; but most families show certain peculiarities 

 in the succession which distinguish them from other families . Infancy , 

 youth and maturity are represented by their peculiar styles of orna- 

 mentation in the ontogeny of an individual ; but these stages, with their 

 characteristic styles of sculpture, cannot always be correlated with the 

 adults of a previous geologic time. This latter discrepancy may be 

 due, in part, to the imperfection of the geologic record ; but the writer 

 inclines to the behef that the unequal acceleration of characters plays 

 an important part, and that features which occurred at the same time 

 in an ancestor are apt to be widely separated in the ontogeny of a 

 descendant." 



In the last whorl, or in the last few whorls, of many gastropods of dif- 

 ferent groups we find the characters of senility. These characters 

 or marks of senility do not necessarily appear together in the ontogeny 

 at exactly the same time. Some occur far in advance of others; that 

 is to say, there is frequently an unequal acceleration of the senile 

 characters. 



These senile features, several of which are, as a rule, found together, 

 are the last characters which occur on the shell, for their appearance 

 is the forerunner of the death of the individual . As might be expected , 

 senile species or genera of fossil gastropods never transmit descendants 

 to later geologic formations, but represent the end members of short 

 branches on the phylogenetic tree. 



The writer believes from his researches that the forces of evolution 

 sometimes work rapidly and sometimes work slowly, and that the 

 forms in which the evolutional rate is rapid are bizarre, senile offshoots. 

 On the other hand, forms which have a long time range go t>hrough a 

 slow evolution, though the developmental features and even the order 



•3 There is good reason for believing that F. pyrum and its numerous varietie^ 

 ■ire descended from a Miocene form which is either identical with or closely aUied

of succession may be the same as in forms whose evolutional rate is a 

 fast one. 



Lastly, an acceleration of characters may result from some accident 

 which occurs to an individual ; and in this case we may find a sudden 

 appearance of senile characters, which may occur in the normal onto- 

 geny of the species, at a later period, or they may be extra-specific ; that 

 is to say, never occurring in the ontogeny of the species, but found in 

 some senile offshoot from the same stock.

Body elongate, well compressed, and greatest depth a little before 

 first third in total length of fish, profiles sloping gradually and evenly 

 back from this point to caudal peduncle. Upper profile before 

 dorsal very convex or gibbous so that back is well elevated in this 

 region. Caudal peduncle compressed, and its least depth about 1| 

 in its length. 



Head small, rather broad, compressed, upper profile strongly con- 

 cave to occiput and lower nearly straight and but little inclined. 

 Snout rather long, convex above, obtuse, rounded, and produced 

 beyond upper jaw. Eye circular, supraorbital infringing a little on 

 its upper anterior margin, and center of pupil only slightly behind 

 first third in length of head. Adipose eyelids well developed.

Mouth small, inferior, and transverse. Maxillary broad, reaching a 

 trifle beyond front margin of orbit, and its greatest expansion about 

 half of orbit. Jaws rather obtuse, mandible a little posterior. No 

 teeth. Tongue thick, rounded, obtuse, and hardly free. Nostrils 

 lateral on snout about midway in its length, adjoining, and anterior 

 with an elevated cutaneous rim. Interorbital space broad and a 

 little convex with a distinct median longitudinal ridge. Margin of

than length of longest filaments. Filaments long, equal to orbit. 

 Pseud obranchise about equal to gill-rakers. Isthmus broadly tri- 

 angular. Branchiostegals 8. 



Scales cycloid, mostly of even size, and in parallel longitudinal 

 series. Head and fins scaleless, except base of caudal, where scales 

 are small and crowded. Small scales on base of adipose fin, outer 

 or free portion scaleless. Lateral line median, continuous and nearly 

 straight to base of caudal. Tubes simple. 



Dorsal inserted well forward, its origin much nearer tip of snout 

 than base of caudal, first branched rays longest and others graduated 

 down. Adipose dorsal over anal, its origin nearly midway between 

 that of dorsal and tip of upper caudal lobe (damaged), and height 

 of fin about ^ in length of its base. Anal similar to dorsal, its origin 

 a little nearer base of caudal than origin of ventral, first branched 

 ray highest and others graduated down. Caudal deeply emarginate, 

 lobes distinct and evidently pointed. Rudimentary caudal rays 

 well developed. Pectoral low, small, lobate, and reaching about half 

 way to ventral. Ventral inserted about opposite base of second 

 dorsal ray, first branched ray longest and when depressed fin reaches 

 half way to anal. Vent close before origin of anal. 



Color in alcohol plain brown, back with a rather olivaceous cast 

 and each scale at its junction with one below a little darker than 

 general body color so that many longitudinal bands are formed, 

 most pronounced or distinct on back and upper sides. Fins plain 

 brownish, dorsal and caudal dusky. Iris slaty. 



Length 16 inches. 



In all, three examples from Point Barrow. The one described 

 above is the only one with a well-developed hump. The hump can- 

 not always be considered a character of the adult male, as the exam- 

 ple described is but two inches longer than another example without 

 the hump, which is also a male. This I have figured. Both have 

 the milt little developed. The small male also shows the depth about 

 4^. A female, but little smaller than the male, agrees with the 

 hump-back male in depth, but this is due to the deeper abdomen as 

 thepredorsal region is not especially gibbous. The comparisons, etc., 

 of these three examples will now be seen as follows : Head 4f to 5^ ; 

 depth 3f to 4i; D. iv, 10, i to iv, 11, i; A. iv, 11, i to iv, 12, i; scales 

 73 to 79 in lateral line to base of caudal and usually 4 more on latter; 

 rakers 8 + 13 to 8 + 15, usually 14 on lower part of first arch; total 

 length of body (caudal damaged) 14 to 16 inches. 



This species attains some size. The type, figured by Mr. Nelson, 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 365 



is 18 inches in length. The examples examined by Dr. Scofield, and 

 those before me, are all smaller, and thus the number of gill-rakers 

 in the original account (26) may be due to age. Dr. Scofield's 

 range from 18 to 22,^ while my specimens show 21 to 23. The scales 

 on the type of Coregonus nelsonii are given as 88. This may be veri- 

 fied as a lateral count by consulting Mr. Nelson's figure,'' though it is 

 evident that the last 3 or 4 are on the base of the caudal. 



As suggested by Dr. Boulenger, Coregonus richardsonii Giinther^ 

 would appear to agree best with C. nelsonii, and in view of our present 

 knowledge, the discrepancies in the lateral line and gill-rakers may 

 now be accounted for. I hesitate, however, to unite these species 

 until Dr. Giinther's examples are more carefully studied, aside from the 

 absence of locality. 



Argyrosomus pusillus (Bean). 



Head 4f ; depth 4|; D. iii, 9, i; A. ii, 11, i; scales 84 in lateral 

 line to base of caudal and 3 more on latter; snout 4^ in head; eye 4^; 

 maxillary 3; interorbital space 3|-; least depth of caudal peduncle 

 2^. Gill-rakers 16 + 28. Length of head from occiput to tip of 

 snout a little less than half of distance from occiput to origin of 

 dorsal. Length 12f inches. Meade river. November, 1897.

 in the dark or brownish spots. These are also distinct on the dorsal.

OncOOOttUS hezaoornis (Richardson). 



In all six examples, largest 9 inches long. They all appear to differ 

 in the aggregate of characters from the form which I shall indicate 

 as Oncocottus hexacornis gilberti. They are apparently all much broader 

 than in the latter, the preopercular spines are all comparatively 

 shorter, the coloration darker, the cranial osseus excrescences usually 

 not so highly developed , and certain sexual characters are apparently 

 well marked. A small male about 6 inches in length shows the 

 membranes between the dorsal rays deeply scalloped, thus resem- 

 bling Dr. Scofield's figure.'' This fin, however, is more spotted or 

 blotched with white. There are also two very distinct white trans- 

 verse bands on the caudal, though a little further out from the base 

 than his figure shows. In other respects, such as the small cranial 

 protuberances and more pronounced markings on the pectoral, at 

 least five transverse blackish bands. The more distinct color mark- 

 ings seem to be a character of small or young examples. The larger 

 examples are females and agree better with most figures. They have 

 the second dorsal entire. All from Point Barrow, one was found 

 chilled on the beach August 29, 1897.

There is little to separate these two examples from 0. hexacornis,

 also paler in life as the examples are decidedly so at present, having 

 been in the same preservative. At any rate, I provisionally retain

SOME MARINE OLIGOCH^TA OF NEW ENGLAND. 

 BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



That the study of the httoral Oligochsta of the eastern United States 

 has been much neglected becomes evident when it is mentioned that 

 but four original references to the subject occur in the literature, and 

 three of these are very brief diagnoses of species. The first is found m 

 Prof. Leidy's Coniributions to the Marine Invertebrate Fauna of Rhode 

 Island and New Jersey, published in 1855, where Lumbriculus tenuis 

 is described from specimens taken at Point Judith, Rhode Island. In 

 1863, Minor gave a quite recognizable description in the American Jour- 

 nal of Arts and Sciences of his Enchytroius triventralopectinatus, taken 

 near high-water mark at New Haven, Connecticut. In 1873, in the 

 Report upon the Invertebrate Animals of Vineyard Sound, Prof. Verrill 

 describes as new Clitellio irrorata and Halodrillus (gen. nov.) littoralis. 

 The first three of these have not since been reported by any other 

 observers, but the last was carefully studied and its anatomy described 

 in a Bulletin of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History for 1895 

 by Smith, who establishes its identity with a widely distributed 

 species of Enchytrceus. Michaelsen, in his Monograph of the Oligo- 

 chceta, recognizes the close resemblance between ^Minor's species and 

 the well-known Paranais littoralis of Europe. The remaining two 

 species have been noticed repeatedly by monographers and systematic 

 writers who have been unable to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions 

 as to their status. 



While engaged in studying Polychceta, chiefly in the region about 

 Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, but also at other points on the New Eng- 

 land coast, for several years past, the writer has collected a number of 

 species of littoral Oligochceta which, besides permitting the identifica- 

 tion of the previously recorded species with certainty, except in the 

 case of Lumbriculus tenuis, embrace several interesting additions to 

 our known fauna. Minor's Enchytrceus triventralopectinatus proves to 

 be Paranais littoralis, as supposed by Michaelsen; Lumbriculus tenuis 

 Leidy is almost certainly Clitellio arenarius (MiiUer); Halodrillus lit- 

 torcdis Verrill is Enchytrceus albidus Henle; and Critellio irrorata Verrill is 

 a composite of Tubifex irroratus (Verrill), Tubifex benedeni Udekem and 




374 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Clitellio arenarius Miiller. To the latter conclusion I have been much 

 assisted by Prof. Verrill's great kindness in sending to me for study his 

 entire collection of marine oligochsetes, including many bottles labelled 

 by him as Clitellio irrorata. Although this material was collected from 

 25 to 30 years ago, and had since been subjected to all of the vicissitudes 

 of preservation in small vials of alcohol, it was possible to determine 

 most of the specimens, and as a result to considerably extend the known 

 range along our coasts of several species. For this privilege I am much 

 indebted to Prof. Verrill. 



In the present paper are noticed ten species representing three fami- 

 lies, as follows: Naiidae, Paranais littoralis; Tubificidse, Clitellio are- 

 narius, Monopylephorus glaher, M. parvus, Tuhifex irroratus, T. bene- 

 deni, T. hamatiis and Limnodrilus suhsahus; Enchj'trseidse, Enchytroeus 

 albidiis and Lumhricilliis agilis. Of these P. littoralis, C. arenarius, 

 M. parvus, T. henedeni and E. albidus are European species, but only 

 the first and last have hitherto been recognized on our shores. Tubifex 

 irroratus is the residiumi of Verrill's C. irrorata and the remaining four 

 are new, but have more or less closely related representatives in other 

 parts of the world. It needs to be remarked that very few of these 

 worms are really marine ; they are more or less recent migrants from a 

 rich limicoline or terrestrial oligochsete fauna. The naids and tubificids 

 are derivatives of the former which have been carried down the streams 

 into bays and estuaries and have spread through the brackish waters 

 and along the littoral zone. In their new habitat they have undergone 

 modifications that are sometimes considered to have generic value. A 

 case of especial interest is that of the brackish water Limnodrilrus sub- 

 salsus, which is the only species of this large genus that has been re- 

 corded as occurring out of fresh water. As pointed out in the systematic 

 part of the paper, especially under Monopylephorus glaber, some of the 

 tubificids burrow in soil saturated with fresh water from springs, and 

 are experimentally shown to take more kindly to pure fresh water than 

 to salt water of sea density. The enchytrseids are more particularly 

 strand forms which inhabit the marine vegetation thrown by the waves 

 upon the beach. They enter the littoral zone, but are often found in 

 large numbers quite above the reach of the waves at high tide, particu- 

 larly diu-ing rain storms. They are undoubtedly derived from terres- 

 trial or amphibious forms that have found a favorable environment on 

 the seashore. Enchytraus albidus, at least, is found in garden and wood 

 soil also, but may have l^een introduced through the use of eel grass for 

 fertilizer. 



The species of Tubificidse described in this paper, as well as some of 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 375 



those described recently by other authors, tend to traverse some of the 

 generic boundaries visually set up and to obscure their limits, Tuhifex 

 is here employed in a broad sense, and it will be noticed that T. irro- 

 ratus approaches Monopylephorus in many respects and removes that 

 genus from the isolated position that it has been considered to occupy. 

 This species resembles Monopylephorus in its valvular and moniliform 

 blood-vessels, the form of its nephridia and the short sperm ducts 

 with diffuse prostate glands. On the other hand, the paired genital 

 orifices, the well-developed penes and the capillary setae in the dorsal 

 bundles are characters of Tuhifex. Ditlevsen has referred to Monopy- 

 lephorus a species (M. trichochcetus) having all of these characters 

 except the penes. The supposed great gap between these genera is 

 thus bridged by two species. On the other hand, Tuhifex hamatus, 

 which is in most respects a typical Tuhifex of the Psanimoryctes group, 

 appears to lack capillary setae altogether. Some of our forms here re- 

 ferred to European species exhibit slight departures from the published 

 descriptions, and it is possible may prove to be distinct when actual 

 comparison of specimens from both places comes to be made. Besides 

 the species described in this paper my collections include several others 

 represented only by immature specimens, from which the characters of 

 the reproductive organs cannot be ascertained. 



The following key will facilitate the determination of species noticed 

 in this paper: 



A. — Asexual reproduction by serial budding and fission. 



B. — Spermathecae in V; setae all hooked and bifid, the dorsal 

 bundles beginning on V; size very small, 



Paranais littoralis. 

 AA. — Reproduction normally by the sexual method only. 



BB. — Spermathecae in V; setae all with simple (not bifid) tips and 

 dorsal bundles beginning with the ventral on II; male 

 pores on XII. 

 C. — Setae /-shaped ; blood yellowish; testes deeply lobulated, 



Lumhricillus agilis. 

 CC. — Setffi straight, with hooked internal ends; blood color- 

 less; testes not subdivided, . Enchytroeus alhidus. 

 BBB. — Spermathecae in X; setae more or less distinctly bifid at the 

 tips and of various forms, often associated in the dorsal 

 bundles with capillary setae; male genital pores on XI. 

 D. — Male genital pores and spermathecal pores paired ; 

 penes present. 

 E. — Atrium simple; no special prostate gland; 

 spermathecae reaching into XI when fully 

 developed, Clitellio arenarius. 




376 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



EE. — Atrium divided into penis sac and sperm reser- 

 voir, the latter with a special prostate gland ; 

 spermathecse confined to X. 

 r. — Sperm ducts long and slender; prostate 

 glands massive. 

 G. — Cuticle more or less completely cov- 

 ered with flattened papillse; capil- 

 lary setae present or absent; no 

 copulatory setse, Tubifex henedeni. 

 GG. — Cuticle without papillse; capillary 

 setae always(?) absent; posterior 

 dorsal setse enlarged and strongly 

 hooked; copulatory setae present 

 on X, . . . . Tubifex hamatus. 

 GGG. — Neither cuticular papillae, capillary 

 setae, nor copulatory setae present; 

 vas deferens very long and penis 

 sac very complex, with spirally 

 wound muscular coats and a tnun- 

 pet-shaped chitinoid penis sheath, 

 Li m nodril us s ubsalsus . 

 FF. — Sperm ducts short and wide; prostate 

 glands diffuse. 



H. — Penes present; genital pores 

 paired ; capillary setae present, 

 Tubifex irroratus. 

 DD. — No penes nor capillary setae ; spermiductal and 

 spermathecal pores median or nearly so ; sperm 

 ducts short and wide ; prostate glands diffuse. 

 I. — Spermathecae paired; setae 

 all distinctly bifid at tips, 

 Monopylephorus glaber. 

 II. — Spermatheca single; bifur- 

 cation of setae often obso- 

 lete, 

 Monopylephorus parvus. 



Paranais littoralis (Oersted) Czerniavsky. 



Nais littoralis Oersted, 1843. 



Enchytrceus triventralopectinatus Minor, 1863, 



Paranais littoralis Czerniavsky, 1880. 



This species was described under the name of Enchytrceus triventralo- 

 pectinaius as long ago as 1863, from New Haven, Connecticut, by Minor, 

 but appears to have escaped subsequent notice in America. I\Iichaelsen 

 places Minor's species doubtfully among the synonyms of P. littoralis. 

 Hitherto budding individuals only have been found, and until the char- 

 acters of the mature reproductive organs of American examples are 

 known the identity of the latter wdth the European species cannot be 




*» 



1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



considered as established. Nevertheless, so far as budding worms are 

 concerned, no distinctions can be detected, unless the number of setae 

 averages somewhat less in American specimens. The prostomium is 

 often slightly pigmented, but there are no eyes. The blood is pale 

 greenish-yellow, and the chlorogogue cells pale brown. The first bud- 

 ding zone usually occurs at XX or between XIX and XX. A second 

 may occur at XXXV, but usually only the first is conspicuously devel- 

 oped. Still attached zooids may possess as many as 28 or 30 segments 

 before the appearance of a second budding zone. In buds nearly ready 

 to become detached both dorsal and ventral setse occur on all segments. 

 All through July and August active budding continues under natural 

 conditions, but worms kept throughout the autumn at Philadelphia 

 failed to develop genital organs. 



Nothing but its small size and mode of occurrence has caused this 

 species to be overlooked for so many years as it is extremely abundant 

 and widely distributed. More than any other species it withstands a 

 wide range of density in the water, being almost equally at home in the 

 rain-soaked eel-grass above high tide, on the shores of brackish ponds 

 and under stones near low-water mark on the exposed shores of Vine- 

 yard Sound, Its movements are characterized by frequent quick, 

 nervous turnings and contractions. 



Clitellio arenarius (Mailer) Savigny. 



Lumbricus arenarius Miiller, 1776. 

 Clitellio arenarius SaAigny, 1820. 

 iLumhriculus tenuis Leidy, 1855. 

 Clitellio irrorata Verrill (in part), 1873. 



Of the ten species noticed in this paper the present one is the largest, 

 full-grown examples exceeding two inches in length and a millimeter in 

 diameter at the clitellum. Preserved specimens usually have the 

 mouths of the spermathecse and the penes protruding in the form of 

 prominent papillae, as Prof. Verrill has noted in his description. Sex- 

 ually mature worms are abundant, enabling one to secure cocoons in 

 numbers and to study the anatomy of the genital organs with ease. 

 There is little doubt of the identity of the American and European 

 worms, the only noticeable differences being a slightly greater average 

 number of setae in ours and an apparently somewhat shorter sperma- 

 thecal duct than is figm-ed by European authors. No entirely satis- 

 factory figures of the setae of the Eiu-opean worm have been found, and 

 it is possible that there may be a difference in their form also. The 

 spermathecae are often filled with large vermiform spermatophores. 



The distribution of this form is equally extensive on the European 

 and American sides of the Atlantic. It is excessively abundant in 




378 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



Casco Bay and northward in Maine, where it occurs under stones and 

 among grass roots up to high-water mark on muddy and gravelly 

 shores. While apparently less plentiful south of Cape Cod, it is com- 

 mon at many suitable points on the shores of Vineyard Sound, Buz- 

 zard's Bay, Narragansett Bay and Long Island Sound. 



Without being able to decide the matter definitely, it seems ex- 

 tremely probable that this is the species described by Leidy. Although 

 the characters given in the brief description of L. tenuis are not diag- 

 nostic, they are sufficient to eliminate every other species described in 

 this paper except the brackish w^ater Limnodrilus suhsalsus, while they 

 all and the character of the habitat, as well, apply to C. arenarius. 

 Vaillant, indeed, has already referred Lumhriculus tenuis doubtfully 

 to Clitellio. Later writers have been more cautious. 



In Prof. Verrill's collections this species occurs far more frequently 

 than any other and usually under the name of Clitellio irrorata, thus 

 giving the best of authority for the inclusion of the latter in the syn- 

 onymy. It is this species that is figured under the name of C. irrorata 

 in Trans. Conn. Acad., 1881, PI. VIII, figs. 3 and 3a. The localities 

 represented cover a wide extent of coast and, named from north south- 

 ward, are as follows: Nova Scotia, Bay of Fundy, Casco Bay, Cape 

 Ann, Gloucester, Massachusetts; Salem, Massachusetts; Cape Cod, 

 Vineyard Sound, Wood's Hole and New Haven. 

 Monopylephorus glaber sp. nov. Plate XXXII, figs. 1-6. 



This species is relatively short and stout for a tubificid, the largest 

 examples not exceeding 40 mm., and the usual length of living mature 

 worms being about 25-30 mm., wuth a diameter of .8 mm. Young 

 examples are relatively much more slender. In mature worms there 

 are from 67-74 segments, and generally they are 4-ringed, bearing the 

 setge on the third and consequently well behind the middle. The 

 greatest diameter is at the clitellum and genital region, from w^hich the 

 body tapers rapidly to the small pointed prostomium and very gently 

 to the anal somite. The clitellum occupies part of X, all of XI and 

 XII, and sometimes extends on to XIII. Except for the sensory hairs 

 belonging to a zone of cutaneous organs encircling the middle of each 

 somite, the skin is devoid of cuticular pilosities and perfectly smooth. 

 Owing in part to the presence of grayish-brown pigment granules, and 

 in part to the remarkably high peritoneal layer of cells, the body walls 

 are decidedly opaque. The external opening of the genital bursa is a 

 conspicuous median, transversely elongated aperture in the setae zone 

 on the venter of XI. The female pores are paired in the furrow

 they are slightly developed, and in somites IV and V, in which they 

 make their appearance, is thickly enveloped in chlorogogue cells wLh 

 largely conceal the dorsal vessel also. ' 



As in all membei-s of the genus hitherto described, the vascular 

 system presents a well-developed integumental plexus on theTateral 




380 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



arches and a remarkable system of imicellular valves. The ventral 

 vessel is free from the intestine, without sacculations and without 

 valves. It bifurcates in III, but is usually reunited in II by an asym- 

 metrical commissural vessel, from which a small azygous vessel arises. 

 The dorsal vessel is contractile, sacculated and provided with a set of 

 valves at each constriction throughout its entire length as far forward 

 as somite III. Although its anterior end is largely free from the intes- 

 tine, it retains a covering of chlorogogue cells as far as somite IV and 

 bifurcates only on reaching II. A pair of small lateral arches without 

 valves arises in I, and after dividing each joins the here double ventral 

 vessel. Beginning with III, the arches spring from the dorsal trunk at 

 the posterior ends of the somites just anterior to the valvular constric- 

 tions. They reach to the body walls, which they enter and then divide 

 into a complex integumental network emptying into the ventral 

 vessel by two trunks in each somite, while the plexuses of contiguous 

 somites are united by a longitudinal connecting vessel. The network 

 is similar to that of M. pilosus, but appears to be somewhat more open. 

 The lateral contractile trunks increase in size to X, one of which loops 

 into the sperm sac, while one in XI forms a rich plexus within the 

 ovisac. Behind XI they become much smaller, but continue to form 

 integumental plexuses which join the ventral vessel by two trunks. 

 The arches from III to XI are moniliform and provided with valves at 

 each constriction. That in III contains one set of valves, IV 2 sets, 

 V 2 or 3 sets, VI and VII 3 or 4 sets, and in VIII to XI 5 or 6 sets- 

 numbers which, while occasionally varying, are remarkably constant. 

 In the larger arches the two primary branches also may each contain 

 a set of valves. 



The brain (fig. 3) has a peculiarly lobulated surface and is broad and 

 very deeply incised anteriorly, somewhat narrower and scarcely emar- 

 ginated posteriorly, where the muscular sheath is produced into a pair 

 of contractile strands, between which the dorsal vessel passes. Ordi- 

 narily the brain is about i longer than broad, but the proportions vary 

 greatly with the state of contraction and extension of the worm. 



Nephridia (fig. 2) begin in VII with their nephrostomes opening into 

 VI ; none is present in X and XI, though a pair communicating with the 

 latter is frequently developed in XII. In young worms, in which the 

 transparent body wall permits the nephridia to be readily studied, they 

 are absent from many somites and developed on one side only of 

 others, but in full-grown worms few segments, except at the posterior 

 region, lack them. The funnel is small, with the prolonged lip or tongue 

 more slender and elongated than in M. pilosus. It passes into a short 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 381 



neck, which penetrates the septum and joins an irregular massive region 

 in which the canal is much folded, with granular coalesced walls and 

 irregular lumen in the anterior part, while in the posterior part the 

 lumen becomes more regular and provided at intervals with ciliated 

 ampullge. From this portion an elongated lobe passes caudally and 

 medially along the ventral blood-vessel. In this lobe are four canals 

 arranged in two loops, the proximal one of which contains ciliated 

 ampullae, while the distal one lacks cilia and, after returning to the 

 massive region, passes into a large thick-walled efferent canal, the 

 lumen of which exhibits a few irregular lateral diverticula, and which 

 finally opens to the exterior by a pore situated a short distance anterior 

 to the ventral setae bundles. 



The reproductive organs agree closely with what is known of other 

 members of the genus. A pair of testes suspended from the posterior 

 surface of the septum ^ fill not only the coelome of X, but large ante- 

 rior and posterior sperm sacs. The former is a short, wide, nearly 

 spherical diverticulum from the septum -^ which arises dorsal to the 

 intestine and projects forward when fully developed to the septum ^". 

 The posterior sac is much longer and, arising from the septum ^ above 

 the intestine, accompanies, but usually does not enter, the ovisac to 

 about somite XIII or XIV. In young worms there are two, but later 

 one disappears. Before maturity the cavity of the functional one is 

 closed by a transverse diaphragm which prevents the vascular arch 

 from entering more than a short distance. 



The large sperm funnels rest on the floor of X against the posterior 

 septum, which is perforated on each side of the nerve cord by the short 

 vasa deferentia, which then bend laterally and each expands into a 

 slightly enlarged region covered completely by a continuous layer of 

 rather small prostate gland cells. This region — the sperm reservoir — 

 bends upward around the intestine, and at the highest point passes into 

 a short ductus ejaculatorius free from glands and opening into the sum- 

 mit of the fusiform penis sac. The latter is provided with a very deep 

 epithelium thrown into rugous folds and relatively thin muscular 

 layers ; but there is no trace of a penis. The atria of the two sides open 

 into the lateral portions of the summit of an eversible median bursa, 

 which probably acts to some extent as a substitute for the penis (fig. 1). 



Ovaries occupy a position in XI relatively similar to that of the tes- 

 tes in X, and are provided with a median dorsal ovisac which, arising 

 from the septum ^^^ above the intestine, reaches to XVI or beyond. 

 In addition to the ova it receives a vascular network, usually from the 




382 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



left arch of the pair in XI, and sometimes the posterior sperm sac in 

 addition. 



Spermathecse (fig. 6) are nearly always conspicuous even in young 

 worms. They open either very close together or by a common median 

 pore just behind the luirovv l^, and consequently are well forward in 

 the latter somite. They have short, thick, muscular ducts without 

 glands, and ovoid or sometimes nearly spherical ampullse which when 

 fully distended may reach nearly the length of the somite. Wlien 

 fully distended the lining epithelium is thin and flat and the muscular 

 layer thin, but when nearly empty the former becomes thick and 

 folded, often in a spiral or annular fashion, a condition which usually 

 prevails near the entrance to the duct, where the circular muscular 

 layer is much thickened. The spermatozoa are never fashioned into 

 spermatophores, but fill the ampulla in compact masses and bundles. 

 This species is closely related to Monopylephorus ruhronivens Levin- 

 sen, to which Ditlevsen has recently referred Vermiculus pilosus Good- 

 rich. From this species, as elaborately described by Goodrich, M. 

 glaher differs in the entire absence of villous processes on tne cuticle, the 

 greater number of seta?, the form of the nephridia and some minor char- 

 acters of the vascular system, brain, etc. 



Another closely related species is M. fluviatilis (Ferronniere), but 

 if the sperm ducts are correctly figured for the latter the position 

 of the prostate glands is quite different. 



Both Goodrich and Ditlevsen have attached much importance to 

 the form of the nephridia, which they consider to approach the enchy- 

 trseid type. In M. glaher this resemblance is entirely superficial and 

 the arrangement of the tubules is nearly typically tubiciform, their 

 analysis into glandular region, large and small tubule loops being easy. 

 In suitable localities this species is very abundant about the shores 

 of Vineyard Sound and Buzzard's Bay. It prefers regions overlaid by 

 a layer of fine organic mud in places where there is an accumulation of 

 decaying eel grass or other vegetable matter, and especially where the 

 salt water is diluted by springs or streams of fresh water. In such 

 places it occurs in enormous numbers beneath stones or a short distance 

 below the surface, while in nearby spots, where the water is of much 

 o-reater density but the conditions otherwise similar, few or none will 

 be found. Nowhere in this region have these worms been found in 

 greater numbers or of such large size (mostly exceeding 40 mm. in 

 length and 1 mm. in diameter) as along the gravelly and muddy banks 

 of the Wareham river, a small stream emptying into the head of Buz- 

 zard's Bay. Here under stones near high water-mark, at a point where 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 383 



saltness of the water is just barely discernible to the taste, enormous 

 numbers occvu* quite unmixed with other species. If placed in pure 

 salt water of the density found in Vineyard Sound these worms die 

 much sooner than if placed in fresh water, but may be acclimatized 

 to either by gradual changes. In brackish water they have lived and 

 bred in confinement in Philadelphia for seven months, and are now, 

 after this lapse of time, as vigorous as ever. That they are partial to 

 low rather than high densities is shown by the observation that those 

 living on the shores of the Eel Pond at Wood's Hole, at a point where 

 fresh water oozes from the ground below high-water mark, burrow 

 deeper toward the source of the spring when the tide rises and covers 

 their habitation, and come to the surface when it falls. Other favored 

 localities are certain shallow and nearly closed coves where great quan- 

 tities of eel grass and algae accumulate and decay in water diluted by 

 rains. Here under small stones below half-tide mark the species asso- 

 ciates with Tuhifex irroralus and Lumbricillus agilis, though the latter 

 is far more plentiful in the decaying eel grass at a higher station on the 

 shore, and the former prefers the roots of salt grasses growing on more 

 gravelly shores. Though not active in their movements, they are less 

 sluggish than the T. irroralus and far more hardy than that species. 

 From the latter part of July, at least, onward this species breeds, and 

 some specimens brought to Philadelphia continued sexually active 

 throughout the fall and into winter. Wlien breeding they are espe- 

 cially active and congregate in such numbers beneath stones that 

 they impart a quite red color to the surface of the soil when exposed 

 by turning over the stones. 



Monopylephorus parvus Ditlevsen. PL XXXIII, figs. 29-34. 



A second small species of Monopylephorus is referred to the above 

 species, with which it agrees closely in nearly all of the characters 

 recorded in the original brief diagnosis. Further information may 

 necessitate a separation. 



In size and form this species closely resembles Lumbricillus agilis, 

 but its distinctly pink color and the opacity due to coelomic corpus- 

 cles, as well as its more sluggish movements, are a ready means of sepa- 

 ration. Fixed specimens can be distinguished in many cases only after 

 a careful study, especially as sexually mature individuals are infrequent. 



The length is from 8 to 15 mm., the diameter about .4 mm. and the 

 number of segments from 38 to 43. The prostomium is much more 

 slender and pointed than in M. glaber, but the somites are similarly 

 quadri-annulate. The number of setae in each ventral bundle is 3 or 4 

 anterior to the genital region and 2 posteriorly; in the dorsal bundles 




384 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



usually 5 anteriorly and 2 to 4 posteriorly. The setse are all small and 

 of the usual form, except that their tips are curiously variable (fig. 29). 

 As the setse were studied only under the rather unfavorable conditions 

 presented by alcoholic material, it is uncertain how far this may be due 

 to wear. Many of the setse are undoubtedly broken, but those figured 

 appear to be intact. In some the tips are deeply bifid and the points 

 long and acute; others, especially in the posterior dorsal bundles, have 

 the upper or distal point more or less reduced, and still others have a 

 mere apical notch or are apparently entire. 



The coelomic corpuscles are very numerous and about .012 mm. in 

 diameter, with opaque white granules smaller and more numerous 

 than those of M. glaber. 



In internal anatomy this species closely resembles M. glaber, from 

 which, however, it is easily distinguished by the single spermatheca 

 (fig. 34) which opens in the median line of the furrow ^^, and is usually 

 folded on itself transversely. The atria (figs. 32, 33) also differ in that 

 they join in the middle line before opening into the bursa by a single 

 small pore raised on the summit of a papilla. It will thus be noticed 

 that the primitively strictly paired character of the reproductive organs 

 has been departed from more widely in this than the other species. 

 The prostate and other regions of the male ducts are otherwise as usual. 

 An anterior sperm sac extends through IX, a posterior through XII 

 and XIII, and an ovisac to XVI. The vascular system presents the 

 characteristic valvular and chambered vessels and integumental 

 plexus. The brain (fig. 31) is slender and the anterior lobes much 

 elongated. Xephridia are of the character belonging to the genus, but 

 are slender and elongated and the nephrostomial lip especially narrow 

 and prolonged. 



This species has not been found abundantly anywhere. Occasional 

 examples occur with the larger tubificids and with Lumhricillus , but 

 it appears to prefer more gravelly shores and the neighborhood of 

 beach grass, among the roots of which it may be found. In a few cases 

 larger numbers were found living gregariously beneath stones at half- 

 tide on the south shore of Naushon. It is quite probable that it has 

 often been mistaken for the young of M. glaber or even of LumbricilluS' 

 Tubifex irroratus (Verrill). PI. XXXII, figs. 7-li. 

 Clitellio irrorata Verrill (in part), 1873. 



The length of this slender species seldom exceeds 30 mm., but the 

 number of somites may ecpial 90. Most of the examples found in the 

 vicinity of Wood's Hole are not fully mature, and are from 15 to 17 

 mm. long, with about 70 somites. The prostomium is more acute than 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 385 



in Monopylephorus, and the somites are more elongated but similarly 

 ringed. In mature examples the clitellum is developed on X, XI, XII 

 and for a short distance on XIII. A pair of spermathecal pores 

 occurs far forw^ard on X just behind the furrow ^, and in line with the 

 ventral sets?, the male pores occupy the place of the ventral setae or 

 a little behind on XI, and the ovipores are minute slits in the furrow ^^. 



In young worms the color is pinkish, but in larger ones becomes deep 

 brownish or purplish-red, often very dark, and in mature worms always 

 very much darker than in Monopijlephorus cjlaber, a difference which is 

 probably due chiefly to the fact that the deep color of the chlorogogue 

 cells is untempered by the whiteness imparted by great numbers of 

 peritoneal corpuscles. 



The setfe are of two forms, one kind being hooked and bifid and the 

 other capillary and of very characteristic form. Both occur in the 

 dorsal bundles. In preclitellar somites there are usually 2 or 3 or 

 rarely even 4 of the former, with 1 or 2 or occasionally 3 of the latter 

 alternating with, or 1 on the ventral side of each of, the hooked ones. 

 Bundles of the middle region contain 2 hooked and 1 capillary seta, 

 and those of the posterior region 1 of each. Normally every dorsal 

 bundle except a few at the posterior end contains capillary setge, but 

 they are easily detached, and in some specimens fully formed ones are 

 absent from as many as one-half or more of the bundles, ^^^len more 

 than one is present they are usually of unequal lengths, the longest much 

 exceeding the diameter of the body. They are very slender and taper 

 regularly to the end, toward which they exhibit 2 or 3 very slight but 

 distinct spiral turns (fig. 11). Possibly this region may be slightly 

 flattened, though this appearance may be due to the lights and shadows 

 caused by the spiral turns. The short hooked setaj (fig. 9) are always 

 bifid, with the distal process decidedly longer unless worn or broken, 

 which is seldom the case. Ventral bundles contain hooked setae only 

 which are quite similar in form to those of the dorsal bundles but some- 

 what larger; those of anterior bundles of both rows are larger than the 

 posterior. Anteriorly the ventral bundles usually contain 3, in the 

 middle region 2. and posteriorly 1. As usual the ventral bundles are 

 wanting on XI, but those of X are not modified as copulatory "setae. 



The vascular system of this species is remarkably like that of Mono- 

 pijlephorus glaher, presenting a similar valvular dorsal vessel, chambered 

 and valvular lateral trunks, complex integumental plexus, and similar 

 mode of branching. As distinctive characters it presents a finer and 

 more numerously l^ranched integumental plexus, with a more conspicu- 

 ous longitudinal intersegmented trunk, and a greater number of sets 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



of valves in the lateral arches. Usually the arches in III and IV have 

 1 set, V 1 or 2 sets ,VI 3 or 4, VII 4, VIII 4 or 5, IX and X 6 or 7, and 

 XI 6. The right arch in X sends a loop into the sperm sac as far as 

 the diaphragm present in the immature worm, while that of XI enters 

 the ovisac and breaks up into a rich plexus. The intestinal plexus 

 reaches as far forward as VII. 



Owing chiefly to the height of the coelomic endothelium the body 

 walls are thick and opaque. Peritoneal corpuscles (fig. 10) are of two 

 forms, about 90 per cent, of them being spherical and filled with rounded 

 opaque granules having nearly the color of the vertebrate red blood 

 corpuscle. The corpuscles measure .01 to .015 mm., and the granules 

 .0012 mm. in diameter. The corpuscles are much less abundant than 

 those of Monopylephorus glaher, and are easily distinguished by their 

 smaller and more numerous granules. With the spherical corpuscles 

 are associated a number of nearly homogeneous, colorless, flattened, 

 fusiform corpuscles and a few leucocytes. 



The brain is about as broad as long, very massive and with a slight 

 median emargination posteriorly, and prolonged anteriorl}^ into a pair 

 of relatively slender lobes separated by a deep cleft. 



Like so many other organs the nephridia have much in common with 

 those of Monopylephorus glaher. The funnels are provided with a 

 tongue which, however, is short and broad, and the remainder of the 

 funnel is much lobulated. Nearly sessile on the septum, it passes into 

 a short and narrow postseptal neck which, in turn, enters a large 

 tubule with a very wide irregular lumen and highly granular walls 

 which is doubled on itself and forms, with the first section of the tubule 

 loops, the so-called glandular portion of the nephridium. The tubule 

 loops have ciliated ampullae and are in general arranged as in M. glaher, 

 but their folds are much more open and in the posterior nephridia reach 

 through two somites. The efferent canal springs from the glandular 

 mass and opens to the exterior in front of the ventral setae. Altogether 

 the nephridium is of the true tubificid type. They are frequently 

 developed on one side onl}'- or altogether absent from many somites. 



The spermathecse (fig. 8) are large, with prominent simple ellipsoidal 

 ampullae, varying much in size and shape with the degree of distension, 

 but usually filling a large part of the coelome of X, and reaching to the 

 dorsal level of the intestine and the septum ^^. There is always a well 

 differentiated muscular duct without glands, short in distended sperma- 

 thecae, but relatively long in empty ones. There are no spermatophores, 

 the spermatozoa being free and loose. 



The male organs (fig. 7) are remarkable as combining the short sperm 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 387 



duct and diffuse prostate gland of Monopylephorus with the soft penis 

 having a thin cuticular sheath of a typical Tubifex. Large funnels 

 open into X on each side near the body floor and, after perforating the 

 septum in line with the ventral setse, pass into short wide vasa deferen- 

 tia which bend laterally and gradually expand into the long sperm 

 reservoirs constituting at least one-half of the entire duct. Near 

 the posterior end of the somite they bend abruptly upward to a point 

 above the intestine, and, by a short constricted region, pass into the 

 summit of the penis sac, which is nearly vertical but curves forward 

 to the external pores. The penis sac is cylindrical and has a thick 

 muscular coat; the free penis begins at about its middle, but is usually 

 considerably folded within the lower part of its cavity. There is a 

 distinct but thin cuticular lining reflected on to the penis. The prostate 

 gland is a thick layer of cells, especially enlarged on the dorsal side, 

 uniformly covering the entire sperm reservoir. 



The sperm sacs and ova sacs are quite similar to those of Monopy- 

 lephorus glaher. When fully developed the anterior sperm sac reaches 

 through IX, the posterior to XV and the ova sac to XXII. The pos- 

 terior sperm sacs are originally paired and in immature worms may be 

 seen to be swept back and forth, alternately reversing and righting 

 themselves, with the movements of the ccelomic fluid. 



It is certain that this is one of the species included by Prof. Verrill 

 in his Clitellio irrorata, and a few specimens are included among those 

 so labelled. As no type is indicated, it seems perfectly proper to pre- 

 serve the name by applying it to this, rather than to permit it to lapse 

 as a synonym of one of the species already named, even though tlie 

 latter chiefly influenced the original description. 



Like M. glaher this is a brackish water species, and the two are fre- 

 quently found associated about the outlets of littoral springs where an 

 accumulation of organic mud makes the conditions otherwise favorable. 

 The remarks under M. glaher concerning acclimatization to fresh and 

 salt water apply equally to this species, which is, however, much less 

 resistant to unfavorable circumstances than that species. Perhaps 

 this fact accovmts for its much less abundance, though its habit of 

 burrowing more deeply into the soil among the roots of beach grass, 

 in the smaller rootlets of which its peculiar capillary sette become 

 twisted, make it much more difficult to find. Sexually mature indi- 

 viduals constitute a much smaller per cent, of those found than in M. 

 glaher. So far as now known this species occurs only south of Cape 

 Cod.

In its usual form this interesting species is at once distinguished 

 from any others of our marine ohgochsetes by the nearly black or deep 

 gray color, resulting from the remarkable flattened papillae filled with 

 greenish-gray granules with which the cuticle is thickly studded. 

 These papillse are arranged in irregular transverse rows in all regions 

 except the prostomium, peristomium and clitellum, but they differ 

 greatly in size and consequently in conspicuousness in different regions, 

 being largest on the segments following the clitellum, and thence gradu- 

 ally decreasing in size toward the posterior end, where they are small 

 and widely separated. There is also much individual variation in 

 respect to the number and size of these papilli3e, and it seems probable 

 that they may be shed and developed periodically, though my oppor- 

 tunities for observing this species over a period of time have been veiy 

 limited. Certain it is that small individuals with nearly or quite 

 smooth cuticle are frequently found living with fully papillated mature 

 ones, from which they appear to be otherwise indistinguishable. Fully 

 grown worms with the papillse scarcely developed also occur, and some 

 of these are among the material collected by Prof. VerriU at Savin 

 Rock, near New Haven, Connecticut, which is one of the type localities 

 for Clitellio irrorata. It is quite evident, from a careful study of Prof. 

 Verrill's description, that his account of the setae is derived largely from 

 specimens of this species in which, as is frequently the case, some of these 

 organs were broken or abraded, and the others exhibited the normally 

 great variability in the length of the distal process. When as slightly 

 developed as in the specimens mentioned, the papillae might be readily 

 overlooked as unimportant. In my experience the capillary setae are 

 more often absent than present. That the European worm also is 

 variable in these respects is shown by discrepancies in the several 

 descriptions, and by the numerous names that have been applied to 

 the species and listed by IMichaelsen. So far as studied the internal 

 anatomy of American examples agrees f ulty with the accounts given 

 by Claparede, Beddard, etc. The spermatophores are very large, but 

 less slender than in Clitellio arenarius. 



This black worm is widely distributed on the seashores of Europe 

 down to a depth of 7 fathoms. On our coasts it has not hitherto been 

 identified. It is common between tides on muddy shores strewn with 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 389 



stones in Casco Bay, ]\Iaine. Here it occurs nearly up to high-water 

 mark in association with Clitellio arenarius, though the latter is far 

 more abundant. In similar situations in Narragansett Bay also both 

 species occur, and Prof. "S^errill has taken them near New Haven. The 

 writer has found T. benedeni only sparingly in the neighborhood of 

 Wood's Hole, and in water both fully salt and brackish. My brother, 

 Dr. H. F. Moore, has collected it along with Clitellio arenarius at 

 Campobello, New Brunswick. 

 Tubifex hamatus sp. nov. PI. XXXII, figs. 12-18. 



Length up to 35 or 40 mm.; greatest diameter about .8 mm. at the 

 genital region; number of somites 85-110. In preserved specimens 

 the prostomium is short and bluntly rounded, the peristomium about 

 as long as the prostomium and divided into two rings, the first of which 

 is papillated and evidently retractile. Succeeding somites increase in 

 size, and the next five or six are biannulate, with the smaller annulus 

 anterior. No further annulation is evident. The greatest diameter 

 is at XI, behind which the segments become much narrower, but under- 

 go no diminution in length for half the length of the body. Many of 

 the specimens have somite VIII and often part of IX or even X strongly 

 wrinkled or furrowed transversely. None has the clitellum distinctly 

 developed. The cuticle is thick and everyT\^here perfectly smooth. 



Setae are absent from the peristomium, the ventral bundle of XI and 

 the anal somite. Elsewhere from one to four occur in each bundle. 

 Anterior to the clitellum four is the normal number both dorsally and 

 ventrally on somites V to VIII, and usually two or three on the remain- 

 ing somites. Postclitellar somites bear almost invariably two in the 

 ventral and a single large one in the dorsal bundles. In no case have 

 capillary setae been detected in the dorsal bundles, the seise being, there- 

 fore, exclusively of the hooked and bifid type. It is, of course, possible 

 that further acquaintance with the species, now known from but one 

 locality, may disclose the occasional or periodical presence of capillary 

 setae in the dorsal bundle. The anterior setae (fig. 14) exliibit no 

 noteworthy peculiarities, and are but little larger in the dorsal than 

 in the ventral bundles. They are slightly sigmoid, with a small 

 nodulus at the junction of the inner and outer limbs, the distal'process 

 of the slightly hooked tip longer and more slender and the proximal 

 one shorter and stouter. Behind the clitellum they undergo little 

 change for several segments, but at about the 20th to 28th somite 

 in different individuals the dorsal and ventral setae become strongly 

 differentiated. The latter (fig. 13) gradually diminish in size and the 

 two divisions of the tip become equal in length, the proximal one, how- 




390 



PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF ' [May, 



ever, remaining the stouter. Probably as a result merely of their being 

 less worn, the points are usually longer and sharper than on more ante- 

 rior setae. At the point indicated the dorsal bundles become abruptly 

 reduced to a single seta of very characteristic form (fig. 15). These are 

 very large and stout, especially in the outer limb, which joins the inner 

 one in an abrupt elbow marked by a prominent enlargement. The tip 

 remains bifid, but is formed almost entirely by the stout, strongly 

 hooked proximal division, which bears the small, slender distal division 

 as an accessory process on its convexity. In intact individuals such 

 large setae continue nearly or quite to the caudal extremity, but in 

 those which are regenerating the dorsal as well as the ventral bundles 

 contain unmodified setae, which are consequently here probably pro- 

 visional. 



The ventral setae of X, which lie just anterior to the orifice of the 

 spermathecae, are much modified as copulatory set^e (fig. 17). Usually 

 each fasciculus is reduced to one functional and one developing seta. 

 The former is about one-third longer than the ordinary sets, with a 

 very long slender outer limb cm^ved in the same direction as the inner 

 limb and deeply cleft into two delicate, very slightly diverging prongs, 

 which are, however, united by a thin curved plate to form a groove. 

 The setae sacs are also enlarged and their outer thirds form eversible 

 sheaths or pockets for the setae, and their closed ends receive the 

 secretion of two or three small groups of gland cells. 



The preservation of the specimens is unsatisfactory, so that histolog- 

 ical details are avoided in the following description of the internal 

 anatomy. The digestive tract consists of a short eversible buccal 

 chamber in I and II, a pharynx with a conspicuous spheroidal and 

 glandular dorsal diverticulum in III, a short oesophagus extending 

 through IV and V, and an intestine with its chlorogogue covering from 

 VI onward. The septa ~, ^, ^^ and ^^^ are thickened, muscular, and 

 carried back to the alimentary canal in the form of funnels. The last 

 is especially muscular. 



While a true integumental plexus appears to be absent, the vascular 

 system is conspicuous from the great development of the anterior 

 lateral vessels, which are very long and arranged in a series of loops 

 and folds beside the alimentary canal as far back as the genital somites 

 (X and XI), those in the latter especially being enlarged, somewhat 

 moniliform and extending into the sperm sac and ovisacs respectively. 

 The lateral vessels of VIII are also of large size, but whether they form 

 contractile hearts is uncertain. A highly developed gridiron plexus 

 of blood-vessels exists in the walls of the intestine, especially in the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 391 



somites VIII to XII, where it resembles the condition figured by Stole 

 for Bothrioneuron. 



None of the specimens is mature, so that the reproductive organs are 

 not fully developed, and further study may require some modification 

 of the following account, especially in what relates to the penis sheath, 

 prostate glands and extent of the sperm sac and ovisacs. Thetesteshave 

 the usual location in X, but remain small in all of the specimens sec- 

 tioned. A single sperm sac (which may be double anteriorly) reaches 

 from the septum ^ as far as XIII or XIV, but probably much farther 

 in fully mature worms. It includes long loops of the lateral blood-ves- 

 sels of X, and is itself enclosed in the ovisac which arises from the 

 succeeding septum. 



The male efferent apparatus is shown semi-diagrammatically in 

 fig. 16. The large, few-celled sperm funnel is so distorted by pressure 

 from the intestines, blood-vessels, sperm sac and the septum ^j that 

 no accurate drawing could be made. After penetrating the septum ^ 

 the vas deferens forms several close loops between the sperm sac and 

 the intestine, and then, after curving round the former, takes a more 

 open com-se in the posterior part of the segment before opening into 

 the atrium. The entire atrium is about one-fourth the length of the 

 vas, consists of a small fusiform sperm reservoir receiving the vas at 

 one end and the rather small prostate gland on one side. At the other 

 end it passes into a scarcely distinct ductus ejaculatorius of about 

 equal length, which in turn passes into the summit of the simple erect 

 penis sac. The latter is about as long as the preceding two parts of 

 the atrium combined, is of nearly cylindrical form, has no special nor 

 well-developed muscle sheath and contains the soft filiform penis, 

 which in these specimens lacks any chitinous sheath. The free end of 

 the retracted penis is received into a small bursa which is provided with 

 a circle of small glands and opens at the position of the missing ventral 

 setse of XL The ovaries are in XI, but the oviducts have not been 

 detected. As mentioned above, an ovisac arises from ^^^ and, receiv- 

 ing the sperm sac and a pair of vascular loops, extends to about XV or 

 XVI. 



The spermathecse (fig. 18) open just behind the ventral or copulatory 

 setse of X. They are probably not fully developed in any of the speci- 

 mens. In those of largest size they have a length about equal to one- 

 half the diameter of the body, are more or less club-shaped with a 

 simple duct forming about one-half the length, and a more or less dis- 

 tinct pouch, which may be elongated or spherical and pass gradually 

 into the duct or be sharply defined. No distinct spermatophores are 




392 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



present, though several of the spermatheca? contained small elongated 

 aggregations of spermatozoa. 



Nephridia are present on the left side only of most, if not of all, seg- 

 ments. In sections they are very conspicuous owing to the large size 

 especially of the middle tubule loop, but they are not sufficiently well 

 preserved to permit a detailed description of their structure. The 

 terminal vesicles are likewise large and the external pores, which are 

 situated well mediad and a little cephalad of the ventral setae, are 

 very conspicuous in entire mounts, in which their asymmetry is very 

 striking. 



The brain (fig. 12) is somewhat broader than long, slightly cleft ante- 

 riorly and deeply cleft posteriorly. 



This species has been found only under stones between tides on the 

 shores of the Acushnet river, above New Bedford, Massachusetts. 

 At this point the water is brackish. 

 Limnodrilus subsalsus sp. nov. PI. XXXIII, figs. 19-22. 



Length up to 40 mm., but most examples are less than this; greatest 

 diameter (at XII) .6 mm. ; number of segments up to 12G. 



The prostomium is conical with the apex rounded, one and one-half 

 times to twice as long as broad. The first two or three segments are 

 very short, not exceeding the prostomium ; succeeding somites rapidly 

 increase in length to X, which, with those following, is five or six times 

 that length. The greatest diameter is at XI and XII, from which point 

 it decreases to the very slender posterior third. Usually the peristo- 

 mium is simple, but occasionally is faintly biannulate; II, III and IV 

 are very distinctly biannulate, with a small, sharply defined annulus 

 split off anterior to the setse, which are borne on the prominent middle 

 portion of the larger annulus; V is triannulate with the setse posterior 

 to the middle of the largest, middle annulus ; VI has a second narrow 

 annulus splitting off anterior to the setigerous one and a single one be- 

 hind; VII is more distinctly quadriannulate, and VIII has four narrow 

 annuli before and two behind the large setigerous one. The next few 

 annuli present an irregular multiannulate condition, there being in 

 most cases 5 presetal and 2 postsetal rings, which are nearly or quite 

 equal to the setigerous one. Postclitellar somites are only very ob- 

 scurely or not at all annulated. 



Setae are absent from the prostomium, the ventral bundles of XI and 

 2 or 3 caudal somites. Preclitellar bundles contain 4 to 6, usually 5 

 setae; behind the clitellum are found at first 4, then 3, and toward the 

 posterior end 2. Smaller numbers are very likely to occur in the doi-sal 

 bundles, though there is no constancy in this respect. There are no 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



copulatory setse and none in any way much modified or enlarged. 

 Throughout the entire length they have essentially the form shown in 

 figs. 19 and 20, the ventral ones averaging somewhat longer and stouter. 

 The two divisions of the tip are nearly equal in length, especially in 

 posterior setee, but the distal is usually longer and the proximal stouter. 

 The simple digestive tract has the pharyngeal diverticulum divided 

 into two lobes by a median fissure in II and III ; the chlorogogue in- 

 vestment begins in V or even IV, and the posterior region of the intes- 

 tine is very strongly beaded. The anterior margin of the brain, near 

 which the connectives arise, is nearly truncate, but has two pairs of 

 small ganglionic projections; the posterior is about one-half as wide 

 and produced into a pair of prominent lobes separated by a narrow 

 sinus, through which the dorsal vessel passes. Nephridia are of the 

 usual type, symmetrical, and open immediately in front of the ventral 

 setae. 



The chief characteristic of the species is found in the reproductive 

 organs, especially in the abruptly bent atrium. The testes are in X, 

 the ovaries in XI, the latter filling a large part of the cavity of that 

 somite, but apparently unprovided with an ovisac. The former pro- 

 duce spermatogonia very copiously and fill not only the cavity of X, 

 but a prominent median sperm sac which reaches to about XXI. The 

 male genital ducts (fig. 21) present the structure and complexity of 

 Eisen's genus Camptodrilus. The large discoid sperm funnel is in con- 

 tact with anterior face of the septum ^j, on the posterior side of which 

 the vas deferens has contracted to a diameter of one-eighth to one-tenth 

 its diameter. From this point the vas deferens forms many and varied 

 coils and loops (not accurately represented in the figure) and has a total 

 length to the point of entrance into the sperm reservoir of about three 

 and one-half times the entire atrium. The sperm reservoir (ss.) is 

 stoutly fusiform, constitutes nearly one-fourth of the entire length of 

 the atrium and receives the massive prostate gland (p.) near the middle 

 of the ventral side. A ductus ejaculatorius about as long as and one- 

 fourth to one-fifth the diameter of the reservoir unites the latter with 

 the penis sac. Sometimes this ductus is folded as in the figure, and has 

 a posterior connection with the sperm reservoir ; in other examples it 

 stretches forward beside the penis sac, and the ends of the reservoir are 

 reversed. The penial apparatus is bent sharply at the summit of the 

 bursa at nearly a right angle and extends thence caudad, sometimes 

 horizontally, sometimes obliquely upward, carrying with it the septum 

 ?jj to a point opposite the setse zone of XII. The penis is the direct 

 continuation of the vas deferens, and is slightly bulbous at the distal

and gently enlarged toward the proximal end. Surrounding it is the 

 cuticular penis sheath, which is 12 or 13 times as long as its proximal 

 diameter and closely envelopes the penis except at the distal end, 

 where it expands broadly like the mouth of a trumpet. The epithelial 

 penis sheath (<?s.) expands distally into a bursa divided by a horizontal, 

 diaphragm-like partition into a larger dorsal chamber (dc.) which re- 

 ceives the free end of the penis and its cuticular sheath and a very 

 shallow ventral chamber (vc.) lined by enlarged cells. From this lower 

 chamber a narrow passage leads to the exterior. The entire penial 

 apparatus is ensheathed in muscle, for the most part arranged in two 

 layers, wound spirally in opposite directions and united at the proximal 

 end in a loose coil around the lower end of the vas deferens. Distally 

 these muscles partly unwind and form a sheet enveloping the bursa 

 and binding the entire organ to the body floor. 



Spermathecse (fig. 22) open as usual in line with the ventral setse of 

 X. They are usually bent into a coil and have a large spherical pouch 

 and a duct about twice as long, the proximal half of which is narrow 

 and the distal half expanded into a somewhat fusiform enlargement 

 with thick walls. 



This species occurs in considerable numbers along with Tuhijex 



hamatus under stones at half-tide on the Acushnet river, above New 



Bedford, Massachusetts. At flood-tide the water is here strongly 



brackish, and this species is of interest as the first of its genus to be 



recorded as occurring under such conditions, all other species being 



inhabitants of fresh water strictly. 



Enchytraeus albidus Henle. 



Enchytrceus albidus Henle, 1S37. 

 Halodrillus littoraUs Verrill, 1873. 

 Enchytrceus humicultor Vejdovsky, 1879. 

 Enchytraeus littoralis (Verrill) Smith, 1895. 



This, the best known and most generally distributed of our littoral 

 Oligochseta, was redescribed and identified with E. humicultor Vejd. by 

 Smith. Michaelsen, to whose monograph reference is made for the 

 complete synonymy, considers the latter to be part of E. albidus Henle. 

 It is an abundant species from Casco Bay, Maine, to Sea Isle City, 

 New Jersey, at least, and, while found more or less everywhere in the 

 upper littoral zone, is especially abundant in the windrow of eel grass 

 which traces the line of high-water along the beach. Wlierever the 

 eel grass is kept moist by brackish water and retains a thick coating 

 of diatoms to serve as food, these worms become large and stout, 

 attaining an inch in length and a millimeter in diameter. Elsewhere 

 they are smaller. The same species, but of smaller size, is found in 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 395 



moist spots on farm lands on Martha's Vineyard, where it could readily 

 be introduced in the large quantities of eel grass that are annually 

 spread for fertilizer. About Wood's Hole it also lives in damp, sandy 

 woods and on the shores of fresh-water ponds, especially of one that 

 formerly was connected with the Sound. Whether this particular 

 species originated on the strand and migrated landwards or vice versa 

 is not apparent. Its wide distribution along the shore, however, may 

 be accounted for by the ease with which it could be transported in 

 masses of eel grass attached to floating logs, or by clinging to the feet 

 of migrating shore birds. The same influences would affect Lumbri- 

 cillus, but not the various species of tubificids, which burrow in the 

 mud or conceal themselves beneath stones. As a consequence many 

 of the latter appear to occur quite locally. 



Enchytrceus albidus may be easily recognized among our littoral 

 species by its milk-white color and nearly straight, internally hooked 

 setae. 



Lumbricillus agilis sp. nov. PI. XXXIII, figs. 23-28. 



The length of fully extended mature worms is about 16 mm. or less, 

 the greatest diameter is .4 mm., and, owing to the relatively stout ante- 

 rior and slender, tapering posterior parts, the general form is distinctly 

 clavate, particularly in fixed examples. Considerable variation in the 

 number of segments has been observed, ranging from 30 to 48, 47 being 

 a very frequent number in breeding examples. The prostomium is 

 short, blunt and verrucose, and possesses a distinct cephalic pore a 

 little behind the apex on the dorsal side. The spermathecal pores are 

 inconspicuous slits facing laterally in the furrow -^j and the sperma- 

 ducal pores are rather conspicuous simple or usually trifid slits in the 

 position of the absent ventral setae of XII. In preserved worms they 

 are usually on the apex of the everted male bursa. The female genital 

 pores are visible only in sections. When fully developed the clitellum 

 is thick and conspicuous and extends completely around somites XI 

 and XII. Anteriorly the somites increase in diameter and length to 

 the genital region, but are always short ; posteriorly they taper rapidly, 

 and are slender and divided into 3 annuli, of which the middle one bears 

 the setae, and each of which may be further divided into 2 or 3. 



As usual in the genus, the setae are of a gently sigmoid form with 

 rather acute, slightly hooked tips and a slight thickening at the junc- 

 tion of inner and outer limbs. Those of the ventral fascicles (fig. 23a) 

 are decidedly larger than the dorsal ones (fig. 23). Ventral bundles 

 contain from 5 to 8, usually 6, anterior to the clitellum, and from 4 to 6, 



usually 5, posteriorly; dorsal bundles usually 5 anteriorly and 3 or 4 

 26 




3)6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



posteriorly. On somite XII there are no ventral and only 1 to 3 

 dorsal setae. 



Anteriorly the color is a delicate pink which resides in the ovaries, 

 testes and oesophagus ; this is purest as far back as the setae of somite 

 VI and again in XI and XII, but is elsewhere obscured by the brown 

 color of the chlorogogue cells. In the yovmgest worms the blood is 

 colorless, in larger ones sulphur yellow, and in still larger ones reddish- 

 yellow. At all ages these worms are transparent and especially so 

 when young, rendering the anatomical study of living ones an easy 

 matter. 



The septa -y, yj and yjj are thickened and jy only less so. The 

 three most anterior bear large, clear septal or pharyngeal glands, the 

 third being more granular than the others. The brain (fig. 24) is 

 slightly longer than broad, straight or slightly truncate anteriorly, with 

 the prostomial nerves and circumoesophageal connectives arising from 

 the antero-lateral angles; jvist behind these is the narrowest part, 

 from which the width gradually increases to the two quadrate posterior 

 lobes, which are separated by a moderate cleft and give rise to a pair 

 of muscle strands. Copulatory supra-neural glands are well developed, 

 especially in somites III, IV and V. They are slender and elongated, 

 not closely united with the ventral nerve, and open on each side nearly 

 at the ventral setae bundles. 



The blood vascular system presents the usual simple structure found 

 in species of this genus. There is a well-developed periintestinal sinus 

 terminating anteriorly at VII. The dorsal vessel is conspicuous and 

 contractile for most of its length, becomes free from the intestine in 

 XIII, and terminates without bifurcating at the anterior margin of 

 the brain, where it joins the pair of vessels arising from the two loops 

 into which the ventral trunk splits in III. Ccelomic corpuscles (fig. 

 25) are of two kinds, much the most numerous being elongated, irreg- 

 ular, flattened, colorless and finely granular ones measuring about .025 

 mm. long and .008 mm. wide. The other and less numerous being 

 flattened, irregularly circular disks, with large granules and a pale 

 grayish-green color, which are .015 mm. in diameter. 



Nephridia of the form shown in fig. 26 occur regularlj^ in pairs in 

 every somite, except XI, XII and XIII, from VII caudally. They 

 have very small funnels and massive tapering postseptal regions, from 

 the postero-ventral angle of which the large efferent duct, which is 

 shorter than the massive portion, arises and passes to the external 

 pore. 



When fully developed the testes, which occupy the usual position in 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 397 



XI, are divided into from 10 to 20 slender, pyriform lobes which fill a 

 large part of the somite. Sperm sacs are either altogether absent or 

 very small. The sperm funnels occupy a great part of XI, are slender, 

 about 6 to 8 times as long as thick, nearly cylindrical, more or less 

 folded when m situ, and slightly contracted near the mouth, the margins 

 of which are provided with a ciliated roll or lip. The A^as deferens is 

 about three times as long as the funnel, closely but very variously 

 folded in XII, and has the terminal part somewhat enlarged and cili- 

 ated. It opens into the small, depressed, spheroidal, glandular and 

 opaque atrium, which itself opens on the medial side of a small bursa 

 in the position of the ventral setae. The bursa can be everted as a 

 conical penis (fig. 27). 



Somewhat like the testes, the ovaries are subdivided into about 20 

 ellipsoidal bodies, each with a cross division, on one side of which is one 

 or several large ova, and on the other a number of small ones. A small 

 ovisac pushes back from septum ^^^^, but is never extensively devel- 

 oped. The spermathecae (fig. 28) are small, pinkish, pyriform tubes 

 without diverticula or distinct ducts, which communicate with the 

 lumen of the oesophagus in V and with the exterior in the furrow ^, 

 near which they bear a circle of glands chiefly aggregated into an an- 

 terior and a posterior group. 



This is an exceedingly pretty and active little worm which crawls 

 rapidly and clings closely to surfaces. It is extremely abundant among 

 the eel grass thrown on shore near high-water mark, and which accumu- 

 lates in great quantities in sheltered coves. Its special habitat is a 

 certain stratum in the bedded masses where the plant is neither soaked 

 in water and much decayed, nor dried by the sun and air as in the up- 

 permost layer, but where it remains moist and coated with- a layer of 

 diatoms on which the worm feeds. If sexually active worms be re- 

 moved from such conditions and placed in clean salt water without 

 diatoms the genital organs quickly shrink, but if kept in even a small 

 quantity of moist eel grass exposed to moderate light they continue 

 to reproduce. These worms are much parasitized by a monocystid 

 gregarine. The species is known from Casco Bay, Maine, to Mne>yard 

 Sound, Massachusetts.

A CONTEIBTJTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACEIDID^ (ORTHOPTERA) 



OF COSTA RICA. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN. 



The following study was based on a series of two hundred and ninety- 

 one specimens from various localities in Costa Rica, and in the col- 

 lections of the Academy, Mr. ^lorgan Hebard of Chestnut Hill, Phila- 

 delphia, and the United States National Museum. These collections 

 were represented respectively by one hundred and fifty-nine, one hun- 

 dred and twelve, and twenty specimens. 



The author wishes to thank Mr. Hebard and Dr. Ashmead of the 

 National Museiun for permission to study portions of the material, 

 and for other favors rendered during the preparation of this and other 

 papers. 



It is proposed to follow this contribution at a later date with others 

 on the Tettigonidte and Gryllidte of Costa Rica, interesting collections 

 of which are now in hand.

 and distinctly sulcate with prominent carinae, becoming obsolete a 

 short distance ventrad of the median ocellus ; antennae distinctly ex- 

 ceeding the head and pronotum in length. Pronotum very slightly 

 sellate, the dorsal outline but slightly depressed at the transverse sulci, 

 all three of Avhich are distinct and well marked; cephalic margin 

 slightly arcuate, caudal margin obtuse-angulate with the angle some- 

 what rounded; median carina very slight cephalad, obsolete between 

 the sulci, slight but distinct on the metazona, humeral angle very dis-

 but not very large; apex obliquely truncato-rotundate; intercalary 

 vein indistinct, irregular and of an indefinite character. Wings equal 

 to the tegmina in length when closed; costal margin a very faint 

 reverse curve in outline; apex rather bluntly rounded. Interspace 

 between the mesosternal lobes twice as broad as long ; interval between 

 the metasternal lobes about three times as broad as long. Caudal

 found in some other species of the genus. Wings with the disk scarlet- 

 vermilion; fuscous band rather faint, prout's brown in color, and al)- 

 sent toward the costal margin, ulnar taenia very slight, apex slightly 

 suffused and the apical half of the costal margin strongly and narrowly 

 marked with vandyke brown. Abdomen fawn color. Caudal femora

Apparently allied to C. sinuata from Peru and New Granada, but 

 differing in the color of the wings and the smaller size. Little else can 

 be made from Stal's very insufficient description, but the later remarks 

 made by Pictet and Saussure show that the new form is close to sinuata. 

 From obsoleta^ it can readily be distinguished by the smaller size, more 

 robust form, shorter and more acute tegmina, more elevated median 

 carina of the pronotum and the heavier fastigium.

Two specimens have been examined in addition to the types, both 

 of which are males, one topotypic of the same sex and in the Hebard 

 collection, the other topotypic with the female and in the United States 

 National Museum. These specimens are identical with the male type 

 in all essential respects, some slight variation in the distribution of 

 spots on the tegmina being all that is noticed. The San Jose male has 

 the antennae but very slightly damaged, and from this we see that the 

 terminal joints are blackish. 



The genus Tceniopoda as represented by the material in hand falls 

 into two groups. All the known species are at hand except T. superba 

 (Stal) and gutterosa Bolivar, which appear to be quite distinct from the 

 forms studied. The eighty-nine specimens examined can be divided 

 usually into two groups, as separated by Bolivar in his key of the genus.^ 

 One type represented by pidicornis (Walker) and hurmeisteri Bolivar 

 is characterized by the rather low and rather indistinctly biarcuate 

 median crest of the pronotum. The other type represented by cen- 

 turio (Drury), auricornis (Walker), pulchella Bolivar and varipennis 

 Rehn is characterized by the elevated, strongly biarcuate median crest 

 of the pronotum, while T. tamaulipensis Rehn is about intermediate 

 between the two types.

The type represented by centurio is especially interesting as all the 

 species are in hand and their differential characters easily seen. Driiry's 

 centurio is quite distinct from the others and need not be considered 

 as its size is diagnostic. The three others — auricornis, pulc?iella* and 

 varipennis — can be easily separated by the outline of the dorsal aspect 

 of the pronotum, jmJchella representing an extreme broad, inflated 

 type with an almost rectangulate caudal angle (fig. 14), varipennis 

 (fig. 12) representing the other extreme with the pronotum compressed 

 and the caudal angle strongly and acutely produced. Between these 

 two extremes is auricornis, presenting a rather broad pronotvmi with 

 the angle acute but not long produced (fig. 13).

This series appears to be rather uniform in size and of quite uniform

 San Luis Potosi and ]\Iicht)acan) specimens in the slenderer cerci, and 

 both sexes in the shorter tegmina and wings, which but slightly exceed 

 the caudal femora in the male, and are of proportionate length in the 

 female. Specimens from the State of Vera Cruz are closer related to the 

 Costa Rican type than to the more northern form. As the material 

 of the male sex from Costa Rica is rather limited, I have refrained from 

 describing the form, but a more extensive series will in all probabilit}^ 

 verify the observation made regarding the cerci.

Considerable variation is noticed in the size of both sexes, while the 

 range of color variation is chiefly in the intensity of the pattern. The 

 Monte Redondo male, however, has the olive green shades replaced by

SOME FISHES FROM BORNEO. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



The Wistar Institute of Anatomy of Philadelphia has'received valu- 

 able collections of fishes from Borneo, principally from the Baram region 

 of Sarawak, or Brunei as given on some maps, in the British possessions. 

 The larger collections were made by Dr. William H. Furness, 3rd, of 

 Philadelphia, in 1898. They are all from the Baram basin. Previously 

 Mr. Alfred C. Harrison, Jr., and Dr. H. ]\I. Hiller had also obtained ma- 

 terial from the same region, together with some other from the Kapuas 

 river in western Dutch Borneo. 



The larger munber of forms are either fluviatile or fresh-water and 

 interesting on account of their apparent rarity. In order to facilitate 

 satisfactory comparisons I have tried to give more or less complete 

 accounts of these. Some others are represented by large series. 



Drs. Horace Jayne and M. J. Greenman kindly submitted the col- 

 lections to me for examination. I have also to thank them for their 

 recommendation to the Institute of the services of the artist. Miss 

 Helen Winchester, who made the accompanying figures. As usual the 

 line with each represents an inch. 



To the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia I am under 

 obligations for many courtesies, such as the use of the library and collec- 

 tions. Among the latter are a number of Borneo fishes received from 

 the Paris Museum by Prof. E. D. Cope, and presented by him to the 

 Academy. As these form part of the collections of M. Chaper, reported 

 by Prof. Leon Vaillant in 1893, they are of value as authoritative deter- 

 minations. I beg to thank Prof. Vaillant for their verification. Dr. 

 Samuel G. Dixon, President of the Academy, Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, 

 ■Mr. Witmer Stone and Mr. James A. G. Rehn have kindly given assist- 

 ance and many suggestions. 



For convenience it may be inferred that the material examined under 

 each species was obtained by Dr. Furness, unless otherwise stated,

 origin of upper caudal lobe. Anal similar in shape, inserted about 

 midway between posterior base of ventral and origin of lower caudal 

 lobe, posterior slender point reaching about * of space to latter. Pec-

Riippell suggests that Pala sorra RusselP may be this species, 

 though later Day- considers it equall}'' near Scoliodon laticaudus (Miiller

 especially the caudal peduncle, and a longer snout than my example. 

 The teeth also appear to be figured broader. Bleeker's account^ agrees, 

 and I follow him provisionally in the identity of the Red Sea form.

12. Galeichthys sondaicus (Valenciennes). 



A very interesting example has the mouth and pharynx nearly filled 

 with ova in all stages of development. They are easily seen in the 

 pharynx through the gill-arches. The largest eggs are about 15 mm. 

 in diameter, the others varying down to rather large shot. Though 

 not dissected the intestinal canal appears to be empty and the fish is a 

 male. Length 12 inches. Two examples from Dr. Fm-ness. Another 

 was secured by Messrs. Harrison and Hiller in 1897. 



A small example from the mouth of the Baram secured by Dr. Fur- 

 ness is 5| inches long. Caudal more or less brownish, and no traces of 

 the vertical pale lines shown in Bleeker's figure.*^ In this respect it 

 agrees with the examples noted above, though the maxillary iDarbels 

 are^^longer, reaching origins of ventrals.

 brownish. Pectoral and ventral brownish above, also outer portion 

 of anal. From the largest one I extracted a small Siluroid, evidently 

 the young, which measures a trifle over 2 inches (52 mm.)." It does 

 not have the dark or dusky blotch seen on upper portion of adipose 

 fin of the next example in size, and top of the head is nearly smooth or 

 hardly rugose. Snout pale like the belly. The next example, or one 

 second in size, has first dorsal ray prolonged considerably beyond dorsal 

 spine. A third example has interorbital space and snout pale or whitish 

 like belly. Lower fins also whiter and adipose fin a little paler. From 

 the pharynx I extracted eggs, the largest about 10 mm. in diameter.

 find any differences except such as may be due to individual variation. 

 The Borneo examples, which maybe considered topot^qoical of kuken- 

 thali, seem to leave little chance for doubt that Dr. Steindachner's ex- 

 ample is simply the adult. All my Sumatran examples show at least 

 traces of the interdorsal spinous knobs or processes, and their color- 

 ation evidently was somewhat purplish-tinted, according to my

From Akysis armatus Vaillant^^ it differs in the coloration, that spe- 

 cies having round pale spots. 



This species shows great color variation in alcohol, some examples 

 are almost black, the contrast between the coloration above and below 

 being very pronounced, while in others this is rather obscure. Other 

 examples have the blotches on the body distinct, and also those on the 

 fins, while others are more or less unicolored. The amount of blackish 

 or brownish on the ventrals also varies, in some examples these fins 

 are noticeably dark, while those of others are pale. The largest exam- 

 ple measures a little over 2 inches.

" Prof. Vaillant has recently given an exposition of the differential characters 

 of the fishes of this family. He divides them into two groups based on the 

 presence and absence of the preorbital spine. This appears certainly to be of 

 subfamily value. His Enopla will then correspond to the Cobitidime as proposed 

 above ^\'hich may be t\'pified by C'obitis Linnanis [type Cobitis tcenia Linmeusl. 

 This group has the erectile spine on the side of the head. Tlie other Loaches, or 

 Anopia, may be known as subfamily: 



MISGURNIN./E. 



No erectile spine on side of head. Typified by Misgurnus Lac^pfede. A 

 species belonging in this group has recently been described by Prof. Vaillant. 

 It appears to differ from Nemacheilus Van Hasselt, and may be indicated as a 

 new genus.

A large series of 193 examples of all ages. Individual variation in 

 color is very noticeable. The larger or adult examples all have the 

 pale vermiculating lines on the head pronounced, though in some they 

 are more numerous. In a number of young examples If inches long 

 they are fewer, like the specimen described. The markings on the fins 

 and body also vary greatly, and sometimes the latter form vertical 

 bands. Some small examples are nearly uniform brown above in alco- 

 hol. Others have the upper surface of the head marked with very 

 numerous small brown spots, due to the equally numerous pale reticu- 

 lating lines. Young examples also differ in their relatively shorter 

 body and rounded profile of front of head when viewed from above.

 broad, obtuse, and its length in profile but little more than diameter of 

 eye. Back well elevated, nape well convex, and upper anterior profile 

 steep and straight. Pectoral long, nearly reaching origin of ventral. 

 Along each series of scales longitudinally a well-defined brown band. 

 On caudal peduncle at base of caudal traces of a brown spot. One 

 example 3|- inches (about 98 mm.) in length. 



This example seems to agree somewhat with the notes under Osteo- 

 cMlus kahajanensis of Dr. Steindachner from the Baram river. In 

 Bleeker's original account^^ the depth will be seen to be a little over 4 

 in what is presumably the total length, while the head is given as 5^. 

 Bleeker's figure,^^ published later, agrees except that the head is a little 

 larger. Dr. Steindachner gives the depth^* as 2f to 2|, which is cer- 

 tainly not in agreement with kahajanensis.

 dal. Tubes simple and rather pronounced. Smaller scales crowded 

 along bases of vertical fins and pectorals. Head, except snout, branehi- 

 ostegal region and mandible, covered with small scales. 



Vertical fins continuous. Spinous dorsal longer than soft dorsal, 

 though at first low where it originates over middle of pectoral, then 

 each spine increasing gradually in height to last, which is highest. Soft 

 dorsal and anal of about equal height, latter originating a little nearer 

 tip of caudal than gill-opening. Caudal small, rounded, of about 16? 

 rays, and last rays of soft dorsal and anal extending on it basaily for 

 at least half its length. Pectoral broad, short, rounded and a little low 

 in its insertion. Second anal spine much largest, similar to last dorsal 

 spine through placed a little anterior to its base. Yent close in front 

 of spinous anal or a little nearer base of caudal than orbit. 



Color in alcohol deep wood-brown, lower surface paler or inclining 

 to very pale or dirty-brown, especially on abdomen, thorax and under 

 surface of head. Dorsals and anals with more or less dark color 

 medianly, and becoming more or less blackish submarginally, margins 

 of these fins rather conspicuously creamy-whitish . Caudal and pectoral

 collected by Harrison and Hiller. The smallest of these differs in the 

 color markings which are very pronounced. The vertical fins also 

 have blackish bases with distinct margins and their edges with whitish 

 blotches. The spots on the sides are distinct and the lower surface of 

 the body is decidedly paler. The largest Sumatran example also shows 

 the following: Head (without rostral appendage) 5^^; depth 8|-; D. 

 XXXVI, 80?; A. II, 72?; P. 22; scales about 285 in a lateral series to

 3^; eye 8; mouth 4f; pectoral 2f; caudal 3^; interorbital space 1^ 

 in eye; eye 2| in snout. My figure also shows the caudal confluent 

 almost entirely with the rayed dorsal and anal. This is in entire 

 agreement with my largest Sumatran example which it was supposed 

 to represent. However, the others, especially the smaller ones, have 

 it distinct and with the ends of the caudal rays free. They also show 

 the margins of these fins whitish. Surely Day's figure and account 

 of Mastacemhelus urdcolor^ represents a distinct species.

 One example. 



This species is evidently closely related to Mastacembelus guentheri 

 Day*^ which has been recorded from Borneo by Prof. Vaillant.*^ The 

 Indian fish appears to differ somewhat in coloration according to Day's 

 account, especially as there is no black bar at the base of the caudal. 

 His figure^^ fails to indicate this. Margins of the vertical fins of Masta- 

 cembelus vaillanti well edged with white, the color pattern different, pre- 

 senting a beautiful blotched or spotted appearance, and the pectorals 

 finely barred.

Mugil helanak Bleeker^^ is the first name available for the present 

 species. Bontah RusselP^ is not available, but it forms the basis of 

 Mugil bontah Bleeker^^ which is its first introduction in a binomial 

 sense. Later Bleeker identified other specimens^* under the same 

 name which appear to be different, and which have been referred to 

 M. helanak by Dr. Giinther. However, Russell's figure of Bontah had 

 been named by Swainson as Mugil gymnocephahis}^ This, according 

 to Day, would lead to its identification with Mugil our Forskal. The 

 discrepancies between my account and that by Day^* are probably due 

 to age.

^Chanda is another of Hamilton's composite genera. Its elimination is as 

 follows : 



setifer =Gerres Cuvier, 1829. 

 ruconius =Leiognathus Laoepede, 1803. 

 nalua= Ambassis Ciivier, 1828. 

 nnma =HamiUoma Swainson, 1839. 

 phula=HamiUonia, Swainson, 1839. 

 bogoda =Hamiltonia Swainson, 1839. 

 bacxdis=Hannltonia Swainson, 1839. 

 ranga=HamUtonia Swainson, 18.39. 

 lala=Pseudambassis Bleeker, 1870. 



The first species affected is ruconius, which cannot belong to my own genus 

 Deveximentum if the original account and figure of Hamilton is correct. The 

 latter certainly represents a Leiognathus, and the description is equally applicable. 

 The second case is nalua which is an Ambassis. The third case is setifer which is a 

 Gerres. Haviiltonia was next proposed for orata, which is based on Hamilton's 

 figure of noma, by .Swainson, who follow? with another name, lata, for the same 

 figure! The remaining species appear to belong to this genus with the exception 

 of lala, for which Bleeker propcsed Pseudambassis in 1874. As this is the last 

 name used generically Chanda must supersede it with lala as the t}-pe. 

 Provisionally the genera may be distinguished by the following key: 

 a. — Preorbital entire; D. long, 14 to 17 radii; A. long, 16 to 18 radii; scales 



small or minute, Hamiltonia. 



aa — Preorbital denticulate. 



/). — Strong teeth in jaws, at least some of them enlarged and almost canine- 

 like. 

 c. — D. radii 12 to 14; A. radii 14 to 17; strong external series of pre- 



maxillary teeth, Chanda. 



cc. — D. radii 10 or 11; A. radii 9 to 11; outer series of teeth in part 



canine-like, Parambassis.

This species approaches Cynoglossus tnicrolepis (Bleeker)*" in the 

 posterior position of the upper nostril which is below the posterior por- 

 tion of the eye, but it differs from that species in the fewer fin rays and 

 scales. It also resembles Cynoglossus potous (Cuvier)*^ in coloration, 

 traces of blotches being evident, but differs in the nostrils and fin radii. 

 From Cynoglossus borneensis (Bleeker) it differs in the absence of the

DIACH^A CYLINDmCA, A NEW SPECIES OF MTCETOZOA. 



BY HUGO BILGRAM. 



Sporangia: cylindrical with obtuse apex, sessile, gregareous, iri- 

 descent, steel gray or bronze, 1 to 1.7 mm. high, .5 to .65 mm. thick. 

 Hypothallus: whitish, rugose. Sporangium wall: membranous, 

 hyaline, not adhering to the capillitiimi. Columella: arising from the 

 hypothallus and extending nearly to the apex, brown, very light and 

 semitranslucent near the base, irregular, flexuous, limeless throughout. 

 Capillitium: brown, radiating from the columella to the periphery, 

 repeatedly branching and anastomosing. Spores: 10 to 12 microns 

 diameter, warted, the warts connected by ridges forming a more or less 

 perfect coarse reticulation. 



If the published descriptions of the genera of the Mycetozoa are taken 

 verbally, this species cannot be classed with any one of those heretofore 

 described. Its proper location is between Diachwa, Lam/proderma and 

 Comatricha. It differs from the first by the total absence of lime in 

 its columella: from the second by the cylindrical form of the sporangia 

 and the fact that the capillitium does not radiate from the end of the 

 columella as a centre; and from the third by the persistent, iridescent 

 wall, the absence of a stipe and the irregular columella. In external 

 appearance as well as in the character of its capillitium it agrees wdth 

 Diachcea, from which it differs, as before stated, onl}^ by the absence of 

 lime. It was found near Wissahickon creek, not far from Indian Rock, 

 Philadelphia.

NEW SPECIES OF POLYCHJITA FROM THE NORTH PACIFIC, CHIEFLY 

 FROM ALASKAN WATERS. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



In connection with the investigations of a special Alaskan Salmon 

 Commission the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross established, 

 during the summer of 1903, a series of more than 100 dredging and 

 trawling stations, extending from the vicinity of Vancouver Island along 

 the coast of British America and into Alaskan waters as far north and 

 west as Shelikof Strait. The zo5logical collections were in charge of 

 Prof. Harold Heath of Leland Stanford Junior University, to whom 

 and to Dr. B. W. Evermann, I owe the opportunity of studying the 

 annelids. 



Some of the more interesting novelties in the families already fully 

 studied are described in this paper; those of the remaining families 

 will be noticed in later papers, while a full report upon the collection, 

 with a complete list of all stations at which each species was taken, will 

 appear in the publications of the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries. 



Not the least interesting result of these investigations is the discovery 

 of a probable error of locality in my paper on Greenland Polychseta. 

 In that paper are described four new species of Polynoidse, viz., Gatty- 

 ana senta, Gatiyana ciliata, Lagisca multisetosa and Eunoe truncata. 

 Some siu-prise was expressed at the occurrence of these new species at 

 a single locality in McCormick Bay, while other bottles of specimens 

 from the same bay yielded none of these, but only well-known Arctic 

 species. There was then, however, no reason for questioning the 

 authenticity of the label. The discovery that all of these are common 

 species throughout most of the region covered by these investigations 

 makes their occurrence in Greenland under the circumstances described 

 exceedingly doubtful. Moreover, the collections of this Academy in- 

 clude several bottles of Polychseta taken by Dr. Benjamin Sharp at 

 Icy Cape, Alaska. On seeing the Polynoidse in question Dr. Sharp 

 states his belief that they were collected by him. It seems almost cer- 

 tain, therefore, that the McCormick Bay label was misplaced in this 

 bottle, and that the specimens really came from Alaska. Unless con- 

 firmed by subsequent discoveries the Greenland record should be 

 ignored as valueless. 




526 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



Eunoe iruncata was described from a fragment of the anterior end 

 and proves to have been incorrectly referred. Numerous perfect 

 specimens in this collection show that this is an elongated worm and 

 properly belongs to Kinberg's genus Hermadion, if this be recognized as 

 a distinct genus.

This species presents a very characteristic .shaggy and disordered 

 appearance, owing to the manner in which the loose tufts of coarse 

 dorsal setee, instead of lying recumbent on or in the dorsal felt, as usual 

 in species of this division of the genus, stand erect and arch high above 

 the back. As a result also of this relation the back appears flat beneath 

 these setae and the sides are nearly vertical. The general outline is 

 narrowly ovate, the caudal ^ attenuated. The extreme lateral margins 

 are formed by the neuropodia and their setse below, by the convexities 

 of the lateral dorsal bristles above, while the iridescent bristles fall in 

 spreading vertical tufts in the space between but are too sparse to con- 

 ceal the neuropodial seta\ The dorsal felted area between the bases 

 of the most medial dorsal spines covers about f of the width of the 

 back, but the spines themselves arch over this area and, as the longest 

 almost meet, form a sort of imperfect bower. As shown below, while 

 there are really but two series of these spines the uppermost tufts are 

 inserted alternately at different angles and consequently perforate the 

 felt at different levels, thus giving an appearance of three series. The 

 segments, of which there are 41 bearing setae, are strongly defined ven- 

 trally, where the body is deeply marked by a median neural groove 

 and a ])air of lateral fuiTOws just inside the bases of the parapodia. 

 The anus is small, dorsal, subterminal and posterior to somite 

 XXXVIII. 



Numerous minute sharp-pointed cuticular papillae stud the surface 

 of the body above and spherical papillae even more thickly below, and 

 the neuropodium as well. Those on the latter vary much in size, being 

 nearly twice as large on the ventral as the dorsal surface of the neuro- 

 podium, and especially large ones are clustered about the base of the 

 ventral cirrus. 



The prostomium is slightly broader than long, with the pedicle of 

 attachment narrowed dorsally and is smoothly rounded on all sides. 

 There are two pairs of small pigmented eyes, the two on each side being 

 borne on a conuiion slight prominence on the anterior face of the pros- 

 tomium. On both of the two specimens in hand the median tentacle 

 is missing. The palpi are rather stout for the basal J, then taper rap- 

 idly to the slender terminal half, the total length being 4^ times the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 527 



prostomiiim. The surface is covered with minute prickles. The 

 frontal caruncle is a compressed, vertical plate as long as the prosto- 

 mium and much deeper, with its upper border thickened and somewhat 

 lobulated and its ventral margin forming an angle from which an 

 unusually long finger-like process depends over the mouth . The mouth 

 has the usual characters and is bounded posteriorly by III. The dorsal 

 tentacular cirri are about ^ and the ventral about + the length of the 

 palpi. 



Elytra to the number of 15 pairs occin- on the usual somites. They 

 are all thin, delicate, smooth and membranous and, except for a slight 

 brown incrustation on the middle ones, quite colorless. Being of large 

 size they cover the back completely and overlap medially. In the 

 middle region they are nearly orbicular and slightly emarginate, but 

 scarcely auriculate as in some species The scar is anterior to the center 

 and reaches to the lateral emargination. Those of the first pair are 

 narrowly ovate, extending over and concealing the head. The next 

 have the part anterior to the pedicle larger than that posterior. To- 

 ward the posterior end they become narrower and relatively much 

 longer. 



There are 15 pairs of "branchiae" (fig. .31) also, supported on somites 

 VI, VIII, X, XII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVIII, XX, XXII, XXIV, XXVI, 

 XXVII, XXIX and XXX. They arise from the extreme postero- 

 lateral region of the dorsum of their somites and are rather larger and 

 more complex than in many species. The medial side is high and rises 

 vertically to an angle from which the organ slopes laterally to the level 

 of the back, bearing the often bifid or trifid pinnae on its free sloping 

 margin. The number of terminal branches varies from 4 on the last 

 and 6 on the first to about 12 on the larger branchiae of the middle 

 region. The elytra and gills were studied on the type specimen only. 



Parapodia are of the usual form. The ventral cirrus scarcely reaches 

 the base of the second row of neuropodial setse. After tapering for 

 most of its length the cirrus is provided with a subterminal enlargement 

 followed by a constriction and a terminal ball. Dorsal cirri spring 

 from a large ceratophore and the long slender style is shaped distally 

 like the ventral cirri. Like the ventral surface of the body the 'para- 

 podia are thickly studded with spherical papillae of various sizes, the 

 larger ones increasing in number laterally and a group of especially 

 large ones occurring on the base of the ventral cirri, while slightly 

 smaller ones are closely crowded about the bases of the setae. 



On cirriferous somites the notopodial setae are arranged as follows: 

 A dense tuft of not very long capillary bristles springs from the ventral 




528 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



side of the tubercle and spreads ventrally and caudally over and be- 

 tween the neuropodia. The deeper concealed ones are colorless, those 

 on the exposed surface of the tuft iridescent, but they show little bril- 

 liancy, being usually of a pale rose-red with dull green or occasionally 

 bluish reflections. Compared with some species they are coarse and 

 rather short, so that they do not conceal the neuropodial setae. Pos- 

 teriorly they become dull gray. Immediately anterior to the dorsal 

 cirrus is a tuft of about 7 of the large curved setae arranged in a trans- 

 verse row and becoming larger dorsally. A second more median tuft, 

 which springs from a line curving obliquely caudad and mediad, con- 

 sists of 10 or 11, the ventral ones being very small and the dorsal much 

 larger than any in the more lateral tuft, so that they nearly meet those 

 of the opposite side in the median line. These setae are of a peculiar 

 clay brown color, of rather soft though brittle texture, finely striated, 

 strongly curved, very coarse at the base and gradually tapered to near 

 the end, which is abruptly contracted to a hard, strongly hooked, acute 

 tip (fig. 2). The surface is devoid of asperities, perhaps through wear. 

 Between these two tufts and anterior to the more lateral a second tuft 

 of iridescent capillary setae, more slender than those described above, 

 arises and spreads caudally and dorsally of the bases of the large setae. 

 The dorsal felt fibres arise in a compact bundle dorsal to the dorsalmost 

 tuft of large setae. The neuropodial setae are arranged in the customary 

 3 rows, the dorsal usually containing 2 stout, the middle 3 medium and 

 the ventral 5 more slender ones (fig. 1), All are of similar form, slightly 

 curved and somewhat hooked and tapered at the tip. All of these setae 

 are much worn, the points blunt and only slight traces of the hairy 

 sheath remaining. 



On elytra-bearing somites the arrangement is the same, except that 

 the bundle of felt fibres is wanting and the dorsalmost tuft of large 

 setae is inclined more medially so that they penetrate the felt nearer 

 to the middle line than on the cirri-bearing somites, leading to the ap- 

 pearance of three series of large setae, as mentioned above. 



At the ends of the body the parapodia are considerably modified. 

 Posteriorly the notopodium becomes relatively more elevated, the 

 whole parapodium more compressed and turned so that it overlaps its 

 successor behind, the capillary setae tufts more flattened, the neuro- 

 podial setae more slender, the large notopodials more crowded, and the 

 dorsal cirri relatively longer. At the anterior end the first has the 

 us\ial 3 tufts of capillary bristles, and the dorsal barely longer than the 

 ventral cirrus, the excess being due entirely to the length of the basal 

 joint. The second bears 2 dorsal and 2 middle neuropodial setae, and 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 529 



a tuft of short fine bristles in place of the ventral tuft of capillary setae, 

 which is not fully established till about somite VI. 



The type of this species is No. 944 in the collection of this Academy, 

 taken by the U. S. F. C. steamer Albatross at station 3,727, off Japan. 

 This specimen measures 42 mm. long, 17 mm, wide exclusive of the 

 setae, and about 9 mm. deep. A larger example, measuring 60 mm. long 

 and 40 mm. wide in a much contracted condition, was taken off Port 

 Townsend at station 4,205. It agrees in all respects with the foregoing 

 description, which is based upon the type, and has the body cavity 

 filled with egg strings. 

 Aphrodita parva sp. nov. PI. XXXIV, figs. 3-7. 



This interesting species is founded upon two specimens of 6 mm. and 

 9 mm. long respectively, the latter having a maximum breadth of 

 6 mm. at XI, which is about the middle of the body. Owing to the 

 deposit which completely covers the body above the general outline 

 is broadly elliptical, but beneath this the form is that typical of the 

 genus though less attenuated posteriorly. Twenty-seven segments bear 

 parapodia 



The prostomium (fig. 3) is broadly elliptical with the long diameter 

 transverse and about 1^ times the length. The posterior margin is 

 slightly concave ; the anterior face bears a slight median elevation for 

 the tentacle, and on each side and slightly above it a somewhat more 

 prominent papilla bearing two minute pigmented eyes. A small com- 

 pressed frontal tubercle having a smooth surface without lobulations 

 lies between the bases of the palpi. The slender tentacle, which is about 

 2-0- times as long as the prostomium, consists of a rather stout vase- 

 shaped ceratophore bearing a slender tapering style with a terminal 

 knob. The palpi arise close together from the ventral surface of the 

 prostomium; they are about twice as long as the tentacle, relatively 

 slender, and taper regularly from the base to a blunt point; their 

 surface is devoid of cilia. Although the large mouth is situated unusu- 

 ally far forward, being bounded posteriorly by a broad, smooth, un- 

 furrowed lip formed by II, the ventral nerve cord may be seen through 

 the skin to bifurcate to form the circumoesophageal connectives at IV, 

 the usual position of the lip. 



Notwithstanding the great breadth when viewed from above, the 

 body when seen from below is really more slender than usual in the 

 genus, the widest part being only about ^ the apparent width and much 

 less than this posteriorly. The cuticle is opalescent and thickly covered 

 ventrally with spherical papillae. Being thickly covered above with a 

 grayish fiocculent deposit the undisturbed animal looks much like a piece 




530 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jwly, 



of sponge or organic debris. On each side is a broad ridge where the 

 dorsal setse rise above the felt, each one or tuft supporting a thick vest- 

 ment of the deposit, which increases its thickness many fold and ad- 

 heres with great tenacity. When this deposit, together with the super- 

 ficial layer of felt supporting it, is cleared from the back a deeper clean 

 layer of felt is exposed, through which the elytra are visible. 



There are 14 pairs of the latter situated on somites II, IV, V, VII, 

 IX, XI, XIII, XV, XVII, XIX, XXI, XXIII, XXVI and XXIX. 

 Owing to their very small size and the softness of the tissues the posi- 

 tion of the last 2 or 3 pairs is somewhat doubtful, but as they seem to 

 occupy the positions usual in other species these determinations are 

 probabl}^ correct. This count was made on but one specimen and a 

 fifteenth pair may be expected to occur on better preserved material. 

 The elytra are smooth, thin, transparent and colorless, without mark- 

 ings or papillse of any kind. The anterior and middle ones are orljicular, 

 with large, narrow scars nmning from the lateral margin to the center; 

 the posterior five are very thin, folded longitudinally, elongated, over- 

 lapping, with anterior attachment and free posterior ends. 



The parapodia are well developed and prominent throughout, rela- 

 tively more so than in most species of sea-mice. Typical parapodia 

 (fig. 4) have a prominent, rather slender, elongated, slightly compressed 

 neuropodium, its end fashioned into three inverted steps sloping up- 

 ward and outward. Like the ventral surface of the body the neuro- 

 podium is studded, especially below, with spherical papilla?. The ven- 

 tral cirrus arises from a short base somewhat on the'posterior surface 

 proximad of the middle of the ventral border. Its style is slender, 

 tapering, balled at the tip, and reaches nearly to the end of the neuro- 

 podium. The notopodium is more elevated than usual in the genus 

 and forms a broad tubercle which slopes on to the back and bears pos- 

 teriorly a prominent ceratophore from which the long slender style of 

 the dorsal cirrus arises. The latter is 2\ to 2^ times the length of the 

 neuropodium, is slender and regularly tapered for f of its length, then 

 slightly enlarged and again tapered to a terminal ball with thickened 

 cuticle perforated at the end for sensory hairs. These cirri rise 

 above the felt and their ends often appear above the material 

 deposited on the back. Toward the ends of the body the parapodia 

 become both much smaller and more slender; posteriorly they are 

 directed caudally and their dorsal cirri are much elongated ; anteriorly 

 the first is bent forward by the sides of the prostomium and bears a 

 tuft of slender setse and the tentacular cirri at its end. The ventral 

 cirrus of the second parapodium approaches the dorsal in size and form. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 531 



Notopodiiim and neiiropodium are each supported b}^ a stout acicu- 

 lum, both of which are nearly colorless and the former strongly curved 

 and terminating just below the base of the dorsal cirrus, the latter 

 straight and projecting rather prominently through the apex of the 

 neuropodium. 



The setse are arranged as usual in the genus (fig. 4), but in certain 

 respects resemble those of Lcetmatonice. The neuropodial setse are 

 arranged in 3 horizontal rows arising from the three steps on the end 

 of the neuropodium. The dorsal contains 1 or 2 of the stoutest, the 

 middle 2 or 3, and the ventral 3 or 4 of the smallest. While retaining 

 the same general characteristics they differ much in detail. The free 

 portion of the largest (fig. 6) exceeds the neuropodium in length, is 

 nearly straight and uniform in diameter to the distal J, which is very 

 gently curved and tapered to a point encased in a densely hairy sheath 

 terminating in a tuft of very coarse fibres with an often recurved axial 

 prolongation. The smallest ventral setse are nearly colorless, instead 

 of deep yellow like the larger ones, and much less striated longitudinally. 

 Their shafts are distinctly curved, with a short enlarged end (fig. 56) 

 tapering rather abruptly to somewhat hooked tips with less densely 

 hairy sheaths, often worn away. The middle setae (fig. 5a) are inter- 

 mediate in character. Usually 1 or 2 setse of the middle and ventral 

 series are provided with a stout curved spur at the base of the terminal 

 region. The location of such setse is so irregular and their resemblance 

 to the other setse otherwise so complete that the possibility of this spur 

 being caducous is suggested, yet this is opposed by the firmness vdih. 

 which it is fixed whenever present. 



Coarse notopodial setae are found in two tufts, one of 8 to 10 anterior 

 to the dorsal cirrus and a more dorsal one of 10 to 12. In each bundle 

 they diminish in both length and thickness from the dorsal to the ven- 

 tral margin. They are brown, polished, flattened and though stand- 

 ing nearly erect are more or less curved toward the median line. The 

 longest are 3 mm. long and, relatively to the size of the animal, very 

 stout at the base, at first gently but in the outer part rather abruptly 

 tapered to a slender end with minute superficial asperities and a hooked 

 tip (fig. 7). The smaller ones are similar but frequently taper to a point 

 lacking the hook. On the ventro-anterior aspect of the notopodium is 

 a dense spreading tuft of setse varying in size from the smallest of the 

 dorsal groups to strictly capillary fibres; all taper to capillary ends 

 which lack hooks but are provided with recurved asperities coarser than 

 those on the dorsal setae. This tuft corresponds to the lateral iridescent 

 hairs of the sea-mouse but is dull and gray in the present species. A 




532 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



very large and dense bundle of felt fibres arises on the dorsum of the 

 notopodium and smaller tufts between and anterior to the large setse. 

 They form a felt much thinner but otherwise similar to that of the large 

 species. 



This species is evidently closely related to A. intermedia Mcintosh, 

 dredged by the Challenger in the West Indies, which is, so far as known, 

 somewhat larger. The latter species is very briefly described from a 

 single specimen, but appears to differ from A. parva chiefly in the 

 absence of ocular papillse and eyes, the form of the neuropodial setse 

 and their longer spurs which, it is implied, occur on all setse. Although 

 these two stand apart from the remaining species of the genus they can 

 scarcely constitute a group of greater than subgeneric value. In any 

 case it is interesting to find such a comparatively minute representative 

 of a genus that includes some of the bulkiest of polychsetes. 



The two known examples of A. parva were taken in the Gulf of 

 Georgia at station 4,194, in 111 to 170 fathoms. 

 Euphrosyne bicirrata sp. nov. PI. XXXIV, figs. 8-12. 



In their contracted state the largest examples are 20 mm. long and 

 6.5 mm. in greatest width, with 25 setigerous segments, all well differ- 

 entiated. The body has the usual robust, depressed form with the 

 anterior end broadly rounded and the posterior decidedly narrower and 

 more tapering. The smooth dorsal area is completely concealed by 

 the notopodial setse, but when the latter are removed proves to con- 

 stitute about one-fifth of the width of the back. The dorsal caruncle 

 is short, the basal plate reaching to the anterior margin only of V, while 

 the posterior end of the prominent crest extends freely to the posterior 

 end of that segment. A pair of prominent black dorsal eyes is situated 

 at the anterior termination of the caruncle and between them arises 

 the median tentacle, which is two-thirds as long as the caruncle with a 

 very large stout base bearing a suddenly contracted terminal filament 

 forming one-third of the total length. The ventral eyes are smaller than 

 the dorsal, black and closely approximated and just external to them 

 on each side is a minute tentacle having a length of about two-thirds 

 the width of the prostomial area. The palpi are ovoid, the broader end 

 largely free at III and are separated for their entire length by a very 

 deep longitudinal cleft. Posteriorly they overlap the mouth, which is 

 small and bounded behind by the wrinkled triangular lip incising III 

 and IV. There is a well-marked and continuous neural groove and 

 the subanal cirri are fleshy and of the usual form. The cuticle gener- 

 ally exliibits a pale blue iridescence and on each side of the dorsal area 

 is a series of brown spots. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 533 



Parapodia are of the usual form and the two divisions are separated 

 by a broad naked achsetous space. All three cirri and the branches of 

 the gills (fig. 12) are long, slender and regularly tapering, the latter 

 shorter and more slender than the former. The cirri stand a little 

 anterior to the branchiferous zone, the dorsal a little medial to the first 

 dorsal gill, the ventral just behind the neuropodial setce and the middle 

 about halfway between. Usually the dorsal cirrus is somewhat longer 

 than the others. On most of the somites the branchiae number 7 or 6 

 pairs, 2 of which usually occur between the dorsal and middle cirri and 

 5 between the latter and the ventral margin of the notopodial setigerous 

 area. As the latter distance is much the shorter the gills occupying 

 it are much more crowded than those dorsal to the middle cirrus. 

 When but 6 gills are present the missing one is almost invariably the 

 second from the dorsal end. No gills occupy the smooth achsetous 

 interramal space as in some species. Individual branchiae are usually 

 biramous and cleft almost to the base; others have 3 branches, in 

 which case one is usually very much shorter than the other two; or 

 they may be simple and cirriform. 



The setae are all glistening white or colorless, giving to these worms a 

 beautiful silvery aspect. They are also extremely long, and as the 

 worms roll up they give the aspect of bristly balls like chestnut burrs 

 or minute porcupines. Those on the dorsal surface are much the longer 

 and conceal the cirri and branchiae completely from view. In the noto- 

 podial palisade the setse are disposed in about 4 transverse rows. In 

 the second row, counting from the anterior, are found the deeply cleft 

 serrate setse (fig. 11), but these appear to rarely extend much dorsad 

 of the middle cirrus. The prongs are slender and their inner margins 

 extensively and prominently serrated. Like other setae they are 

 hollow, with granular contents impregnated with calcium carbonate. 

 The first, third and fourth rows contain only the unequally pronged 

 bifid setae, those of the third row (fig. 9), while not much stouter, being 

 nearly twice as long as the others (fig. 10), and having much longer 

 prongs. As is the case with the serrate setae, the longer prong is ex- 

 panded slightly opposite the tip of the shorter, beyond which it tapers 

 in a slightly curved point. Neuropodial setae (fig. 8) have the form of 

 the smooth notopodials, and the longest are about the length of the 

 shorter of the latter. At the ventral margin of the bundles they be- 

 come much shorter with more strongly curved tips. Dried prepara- 

 tions of the smooth setae show that their cavities are camerated, with 

 septa and telescoped siphuncle-like tubes much like a Nautilus shell, 

 but much less regularly. 




534 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



This species is most closely related to E. horealis Oersted and E. 

 longisetosa Horst, but is distinguished from both by numerous charac- 

 ters. It was taken from the Gulf of Georgia to Behm canal, in depths 

 ranging from 18 to 134 fathoms. 



Euphrosyne liortensis sp. nov. Plate XXXIV, figs. 13 to 16. 



Length about 22 mm., width 7 mm., numl^er of segments 35 to 38. 

 The general aspect of the dorsum of this species reminds one of a well- 

 kept garden with a central avenue from which diverge parallel rows of 

 plants with aisles between. 



The body has the usual depressed form, flat below, slightly arched 

 above ; in contraction the two ends are rounded nearly equally. Below 

 the segments are strongly marked ; abo^•e they are more ol)scured l:>y 

 the gills and setse except in the median space which ecpials about ^ of the 

 total width and in which each segment is divided into a posterior me- 

 dian and a pair of anterior lateral areas. The caruncle is long and 

 narrow, reaching from II to the posterior margin of \l, with a pair of 

 pronounced lateral longitudinal grooves and a narrow but distinct 

 median ridge or crest, the posterior end of which is free. At the end 

 of the caruncle are the conspicuous, black, dorsal eyes, sometimes two 

 pairs, of which the anterior are the larger, sometimes a single pair of 

 slongated form, or occasionally a single one on one side and two on the 

 other. A median tentacle arises from between the eyes and has a 

 length of barely 1^ times the width of the caruncle; it is 2-jointed, the 

 basal joint stout, the terminal filamentous and somewhat shorter. On 

 the ventral aspect of the prostomial area between the first pair of 

 forwardly directly parapodia is a pair of black ventral eyes, which are 

 frequently coalesced into a single median one flanked by a pair of minute 

 tentacles. The palpi are continuous anteriorly with somites I and II, 

 and extend caudally as a pair of prominent rounded lobes Avhich end 

 freely at IV, covering the small mouth, which is bounded behind by IV 

 and V. A faint neural groove follows the median ventral line to the 

 pygidium, which bears a pair of short, thick, fleshy, grooved, subanal 

 cirri. 



The notopodia are completely coalesced with the dorsal surface and 

 their setigerous areas cover most of the back except the median region. 

 The neuropodia project from the sides of the somites, and between them 

 and the notopodia are narrow oblique smooth areas without seta\, into 

 which the lower end of the series of branchia bend forward. All three 

 cirri are rather stout and conical. The dorsal is situated at the dorsal 

 end of the branchiferous line, the middle anterior to the latter and about 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 535 



the middle of the notopodial area and the ventral just behind the neuro- 

 podial tuft of setip. 



The branchiae are situated behind the palisade of notopodial setae, 

 beginning at the dorsal cirrus and extending fon\'ard around the ven- 

 tral border of the setae into the interramal area. Owing to the rela- 

 tively short notopodial setse the gills show distinctly and the body ap- 

 pears more depressed and has a dorsal aspect totally different from E. 

 bicirrata. Like E. heterobranchia and some other species the form of 

 the gills (fig. 16) varies greatly. A few near the ventral end of the 

 series are often quite simple and cirriform, and from this unbranched 

 form they vary to those with as many as 8 branches, the complexity 

 of the branching increasing with approximate regularity from the ven- 

 tral to the dorsal end of the series, except that the ventr almost gill 

 is usually much more branched than those immediately above it. The 

 following table shows the number of branches counted on segments 

 of the middle of the body of four specimens, the position of the three 

 cirri being indicated by their initial letters : 



D.C. 6, 8, 7, 7, 6, M.C. 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 2, 3, 3, V.C. 



D.C. 7, 7, 6, 6, -, M.C. 5, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1, 5, -, V.C.

D.C. 7, 6, 6, 5, -, M.C. 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 5, -, V.C. 



The 2 or 3 ventralmost gills occupy the space between the neuropodial 

 and notopodial setae, and it will be noticed that 4 or 5 lie dorsal and 

 7 or 8 ventral to the middle cirrus. The larger numbers are found 

 upon the larger and the smaller upon the smaller specimens, but it 

 seems probable from a comparison of the number of branches that both 

 divisions and coalescences of the ventral gills occur. Reduced numbers 

 are found also on a few segments at each end of the body. The 

 branches, which seldom arise upon a strictly dichotomous plan, spread 

 widely from a short trunk into a low bush-like form and terminate 

 without expansions in slender, tapering tips. 



All setae are white or colorless except at the extreme tips, which are 

 stained with sulphur yellow. All are translucent, very brittle and hol- 

 low, with their cavities filled with the usual granular contents. ^ The 

 notopodials are slightly longer than the gills and of two forms. Deeply 

 cleft, very strongly and extensively serrate setae (fig. 15) occur in the 

 middle rows of the palisade. The remaining rows have only stout 

 spurred setae (fig. 14) without serrations, and there are no deeply cleft 

 or bifid setae without serrations. The spur is always very short, though 

 the internal cavity is deeply bifurcate. Many of these set£e have the 

 middle part of the shaft encircled by many fine parallel canals situated 




536 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



just beneath the cortical layer and more or less completely annular. 

 The nenropodials are somewhat longer and more slender. They have 

 more slender, longer and more curved tips and longer lateral spurs than 

 the notopodial setae just described and in some cases at least the cavity 

 is not bifurcate (fig. 13). The setae of the middle region depart remark- 

 ably little from the exact forms figured for the three kinds. 



This species appears to resemble E. maculata Horst rather closely, 

 but is readily distinguished by the position of the middle cirrus, which 

 is between the second and third gills in the latter. From E. hetero- 

 hranchia Jonnson the absence of smooth cleft notopodial setae especially 

 distinguishes it, while E.aurantiaca Johnson and E.superha Marenzeller 

 both have a smaller number of gills, longer spurs to the notopodial setae 

 and other distinguishing features. 



This species is much less common than E. hicirrato, and was taken 

 at stations 4,272 and 4,274 only, in Chilkoot Inlet, Alaska, in 45 to 73 

 fathoms. 

 Eunoe depressa sp. nov. PI. XXXIV, figs. 17, 18, PI. XXXV, figs. 19 and 20. 



An interesting species of at least partially commensalistic habits. 

 The type is 30 mm. long, 11 mm. between the tips of the parapodia, 

 and 14 between the tips of the setae at XVII, the broadest somite. The 

 largest specimen is 40 mm. long. 



The prostomium is about as long as broad, divided anteriorly by a 

 deep median furrow which reaches half its length; its lobes produced 

 into divergent, widely separated and prominent peaks. Of the two 

 pairs of eyes the anterior are slightly the larger, strictly lateral and at 

 the widest part of the prostomium near the middle; the smaller pos- 

 terior pair dorsal, less widely separated and close to but distinctly 

 anterior to the posterior margin of the prostomium. All of the cephalic 

 appendages are short and stout. The median tentacle is barely 2^ 

 times the length of the prostomium, its base very short and stout; the 

 proximal f of the style thick and little tapered, ending in a slight en- 

 largement beyond which it abruptly contracts into a delicate terminal 

 filament; its surface is covered with numerous but short cilia. The 

 lateral tentacles arise entirely ventral to the median, close to the 

 median line and quite inside the line of the peaks; they are stout, taper 

 gently for about the proximal f and beyond that are contracted 

 abruptly into a terminal filament; the ciliation is sparse. The palpi 

 are stout, short, in all 4 specimens much shorter than the median ten- 

 tacle, the terminal filament of which they barely reach; their own 

 terminal filament is minute ; their cilia are arranged along a few longi- 

 tudinal lines. The tentacular cirri resemble the median tentacle, which 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 537 



the dorsal almost equals, while the ventral is ^ shorter. In one speci- 

 men the protruded proboscis is short and broad, 7 mm. long and 3.5 

 wide. The jaws are deep brown, strong and with a prominent lateral 

 ridge on the jaw plate. There are 9 soft papillifi above and 9 below. 



Fifteen pairs of elytra are borne on the usual somites by stout elytro- 

 phores which are nearly equalled in size by the homologous dorsal 

 tubercles of the cirriferous somites. The elytra (fig. 20) are thick, stiff 

 and of tough, cartilaginoid texture; the margins bear only a few goblet- 

 shaped sensory papillae and traces of a few or no cilia ; the dorsal surface 

 is studded with small, distant, horny spines and much more numerous, 

 smaller, horny prickles; the former are always in the center of round, 

 slightly elevated brown spots and the latter, while themselves brown, 

 are surrounded by a pale ring. The first elytron is circular, the next 11 

 subquadrate reniform, and the last 2 or 3 broadly ovate, the last with a 

 straight inner margin. 



Typical parapodia (fig. 19) are rather long, high and compressed. 

 The neuropodium is prominent and slopes both dorsally and ventrally 

 to the prominent acicular process which is produced into a short soft 

 supraacicular papilla. The notopodium is also large and produced into 

 a prominent acicular process. The ventral cirrus is subulate, with a 

 slender end reaching to about the third row of subacicular setae. The 

 dorsal cirrus is remarkable for the great length of the ceratophore which 

 is f as long as the style and in close contact with the dorsal border of 

 the notopodium. The style is short and stout, little tapered and has a 

 subterminal enlargement tapering into a slender tip. 



The body is very flat and much depressed, widest near the middle 

 and tapering both ways. Nephridial tubercles exist on all but a few 

 of the most anterior somites; they are of moderate length and are 

 directed dorsally between the bases of the parapodia. The anal cirri 

 are similar to the dorsal cirri and equal to the last 9 segments in length. 



Neuropodial setae are borne in 3 supraacicular and 8 subacicular 

 series, those in the dorsal rows being, as usual, more slender and 

 provided with a greater number of spines. They (fig. 17) are 

 moderately slender with rather elongated ends provided with 

 numerous rows of spines which become larger and more prominent 

 distally ; the smooth tip is rather long, slender and but little 

 hooked. The parapodium of I, bearing the tentacular cirri, has 

 a small neuropodium with an acicular process and 2 or 3 setae. The 

 notopodial sette (fig. 18) are relatively few in number, much stouter 

 than the neuropodials, the dorsal ones especially being short and stout 

 and the longest ventral ones about h the length of the longest neuro- 




538 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



podial setse; they are closely pectinated with | rings of fine spines, 

 leaving a smooth tip somewhat less in length than the greatest diam- 

 eter of the seta. 



The body throughout is colorless, the exposed parts of the elytra 

 mottled with white and rich brown, the caudal cirri, dorsal cirri and 

 cephalic appendages brown with a subterminal white ring and light 

 filament, the palpi only lacking the ring but retaining the white tip. 



This species is represented by four examples, the type from station 

 4,261, Dundas Bay, 8-10 fathoms, and one specimen each from Union 

 Bay, Alaska, and from station 4,270, Afognak Bay, 14-19 fathoms. 

 The latter is labelled "Hermit crab, messmate," and many of the papillse 

 on the elytra bear 2 or .3 spines. 

 Antmoe macrolepida sp. nov. PI. XXXV, figs. 21-23. 



This fine species has a length up to 45 mm. with a breadth of 12 mm. 

 and including the setai of 18 mm. 



The short broad prostomium (fig. 21) is about H times as broad as 

 long, smoothly rounded laterally, broadly cleft and bilobate anteriorly 

 and slightly divided for its entire length by a shallow, dorsal, median 

 furrow. The anterior lobes are broadly rounded and largely occupied 

 by the anterior eyes and the cephalic peaks, usually prominent in the 

 genus, are in this species nearly obsolete. In one small specimen of 

 14 mm., however, they present the ordinary appearance, and, as the 

 eyes are small, it seems quite probable that in the species as here de- 

 scribed we have to do with an epigamous phase in which the great 

 development of the anterior eyes has mechanically or otherwise reduced 

 the size of the peaks. The anterior eyes are very large, provided with 

 well-developed lenses, and occupy the entire antero-lateral aspect of 

 the prostomium, facing forward and outward. The posterior eyes 

 appear by comparison minute, and are widely separated on the pos- 

 tero-lateral curvature of the prostomium; in the preserved specimens 

 they are always partly hidden by the bases of the elytrophores of 

 somite II. 



The median tentacle is long and slender, 5 or 6 times the length of 

 the prostomium; its ceratophore is more than ^ as long as the latter, 

 and the delicate style tapers regularly to the outer ^ where a slight 

 thickening occurs followed by a slender terminal filament. It bears a 

 few scattered clavate cilia. The very small lateral tentacles spring 

 from short, nearly spherical ceratophores situated on the ventral sur- 

 face of the anterior prostomial lobes and partly beneath the median 

 tentacle. Their total length is only 1^ times the prostomium and their 

 slender subulate styles have the terminal half almost filamentous. The 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 539 



palpi are likewise slender and from 6 to 9 times (usually the former) the 

 length of the prostomium. They taper regularly to an acute tip and 

 are marked with longitudinal ciliated lines. The tentacular cirri are 

 similar in form to the median tentacle, but they are much more strongly 

 ciliated and only f as long. The mouth is bounded behind by a 

 strongly furrowed lip which reaches to III. In a specimen 30 mm. 

 long the proboscis is extended to a length of 9 mm. and a breadth of 

 3 mm. It is provided with acute jaws of the usual form and bears 9 

 soft papillse above and 9 below. 



The body is narrow and nearly linear; its ventral width scarcely 

 equals the extreme length of the parapodia, and is practically uniform 

 from somite V to the middle of the body, beyond which it tapers very 

 gently to the pygidium. A strongly marked neural groove runs for its 

 entire length. Nephridial tubercles are first evident on IX and are 

 nowhere much elongated. Dorsally the greatest width is from VIII 

 to XIX. There are 39 somites. 



The 15 pairs of elytra are borne on somites II, IV, "\^ VII. IX, XI, 

 XIII, XV, XVII, XIX, XXI, XXIIl, XXVI, XXIX and XXXII. 

 They are remarkably large, overlap broadly both antero-posteriorly 

 and medially, have a soft membranous texture and a weak attachment, 

 so that they are easily detached. The first is subcircular, the next 3 

 are broadly reniform, and those following, except the last, broadly 

 elliptical ; the last is broadly subovoidal with a straight inner margin. 

 To the naked e5^e the scales appear quite smooth, but a moderate mag- 

 nification shows the greater part of the surface covered with scattered 

 small, slightly curved, conical spines which become more numerous 

 toward the posterior margin where they are associated with a few slen- 

 der, clavate cilia. Cilia of various lengths occur also on the free margin 

 of the scales. It appears that in natiu'e the elytra are frequently lost 

 and replaced, and that when detached asymmetrically the remaining 

 one of the pair will increase in size and completely cover the back as 

 far as the bases of the dorsal cirri of the opposite side. Even when 

 both elytra of a pair are symmetrically developed they overlap so 

 broadly in the median line that less than half of their extent is exposed 

 when all are in place. 



As indicated above the parapodia are elongated and fully equal the 

 body width. The prominent and slender neuropodia are ol^liquely 

 truncate distally and have the dorsal angle prolonged anterior to the 

 setae into a slender aeicular process with a free filament equalling the 

 ventral cirrus in length. The notopodium is a low cylindrical process 

 arising rather anterior to the base of the neuropodium and bears the 

 35 




540 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



slender acicular process which is not prolonged into a filament beyond 

 the place of emergence of the aciculum. The notopodial cirri have 

 a form similar to the median tentacle, b\it the siibterminal enlargement 

 is rather more prominent and the entire style about \ longer so that 

 they reach well bej^ond the tips of the longest seta?. They bear clavate 

 cilia which decrease in size and number distally and are altogether ab- 

 sent from the distal filament. The ceratophores are small and slightly 

 dorsal and j^osterior to the base of the notopodium. Ventral cirri arise 

 well distad of the middle of the ventral surface of the parapodium; they 

 have slender subulate styles that barely reach the base of the neuro- 

 podial acicular process. Toward the ends of the body the parapodia 

 undergo the customary changes in form, the posterior dorsal cirri espe- 

 cially being very slender, elongated and nearly lacking the subterminal 

 enlargement. 



Each ramus of the parapodium is supported by a tapering aciculum, 

 especially stout in the case of the neuropodium, and suddenly reduced 

 in diameter at the end, ^\'hich is free for only a short distance. All of 

 the setae are of a pale glistening straw color and to the naked eye or 

 under a hand lens appear to be highly burnished. The notopodials 

 (fig. 23) are relatively few in number and spread radially from a center. 

 The dorsal ones are quite short ; the ventrals about § as long as the 

 longest neuropodials. All are rather stout, nearly straight, with short, 

 bluntly pointed, smooth tips and numerous rows of minute spines ex- 

 tending about half way round the seta and covering about h of its 

 exposed portion. All of the neuropodials and especially the supraaci- 

 cular ones are very long and slender. They are arranged in a dense 

 tuft sj^reading vertically. The shaft is very slightly curved and the 

 distal thickening (fig. 22) remarkably elongated and at the tip (fig. 22a) 

 abruptly contracted into a delicate terminal bristle. All of this region 

 is furnished with numerous short transverse rows of long, A^ery fine 

 hairs which become longer and more spreading at the tip where a num- 

 ber of the longest overlap the base of the terminal awn. The peris- 

 tomial parapodium bears small tufts of both notopodial and neuropo- 

 dial seta?. 



The general color of the body above is reddish-brown with narrow, 

 light, transverse, intersegmental lines which become broader in some 

 of the paler specimens, in which also a second narrow transverse line 

 may appear across each segment. The dorsal cirri and all cephalic 

 appendages except the palpi, which are pale, are dark brown with a pale 

 subterminal ring. The elytra are pale marbled with brown, especially 

 posteriorly, or with 2 large divided crescentic spots of brown. One 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 541 



particularly beautiful specimen has the body nearly without pigment, 

 and the elytra with large irregular spots and a narrow posterior border 

 of reddish-brown. The ventral surface generally and the parapodia, 

 except their dorsal surface, are unicolor, sometimes clear pale brown, 

 often dark brown or purplish or even nearly black, but always uniform 

 and unspotted and highly characteristic. The nem'opodial cirri are 

 always pale and in strong contrast to their dark siuroundings. 



Many of these large-eyed examples are sexually matm-e and, as men- 

 tioned above, it is probable that they represent the epigamous phase, 

 which the long setae indicate may be pelagic. The single small-eyed 

 individual is only 14 mm. long and immature, but the neuropodial setse 

 are elongated and exactly like those of the larger specimens. 



A. -tnacrolepida is quite plentiful at the more northerly stations, but 

 occurs as far south as the Gulf of Georgia, at station 4,192, in 89 to 97 

 fathoms, but also in 293 fathoms in Chatham Strait, from which the 

 t3^pe came at station 4,264. 



HOLOLEPIDA gen. nov. 



The body is much elongated; anteriorly elytra and dorsal cirri alter- 

 nate in the usual manner, but in the middle and posterior regions all 

 segments bear elytra only; a large free nuchal plate overlaps the pros- 

 tomium dorsally 



Hololepida magna sp. nov. PI. XXXV. figs. 24-29. 



Unfortunately but a single specimen represents this interesting 

 species. This is in three pieces, apparently making up the entire worm, 

 as they fit together accurately. If this be the case the total length from 

 the anterior margin of the prostomium to the posterior margin of the 

 pygidium is 250 mm., the number of somites 120 and the arrangement 

 of the elytra as indicated below. The form is elongated and depressed, 

 increasing in width to about XXV, then remaining uniform to about 

 the last 20 segments. 



The prostomium (fig. 24) is twice as wide as long, omitting the ten- 

 tacular prolongations, deeply divided by an anterior cleft and a median 

 dorsal furrow, its posterior border straight and concealed and the lat- 

 eral angles very prominent. Anteriorly it is prolonged into a pair of 

 prominent tentacidar processes in the fashion of Lepidoriotus, though 

 they lie on a somewhat lower plane than in that genus, being slightly 

 ventral to the median tentacle. The two pairs of eyes are very large, 

 occupy the entire postero-lateral portion of the prostomium and their 

 pigment cups are coalesced. Both are blue-black and possess distinct 

 leiLses. The anterior pair looks forward, upward and outward and the 

 posterior upward and backward. The median tentacle arises from a 




542 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jutyj 



large swollen base which fills the anterior cleft, but the style is lost. As 

 noted above, the ceratophores of the lateral tentacles are the anterior 

 prolongations of the prostomiiim, which nearly equal and lie somewhat 

 ventral to the median tentacle; their st3des are slender, about 2h times 

 as long as the prostomial width, and taper to the tip without a subter- 

 minal enlargement. Comparatively very stout palpi crowd the peris- 

 tomial parapodia; they are coiLstricted at the base, then swollen and 

 again tapered to acute tips; their length is aljout ItV times the lateral 

 tentacles; each is marked longitudinalh' l)y a prominent broad ridge 

 and lateral impressed lines. 



The buccal parapodia are prominent and elongated, reaching directly 

 for\\ard far l^eyond the prostomium; they are swollen at the base, 

 deeply cleft at the end and bear no setce. The tentacular cirri have a 

 distinct subterminal enlargement tapering into a filiform tip. They 

 somewhat exceed the lateral tentacles in length. As usual in the 

 family the proboscis is stout and muscular. When fully protruded it 

 measures 21 mm. long, equalling the first 17 somites, and 7 nnn. wide 

 by 9 mm. deep. Its surface is strongly wrinkled and its end bears 16 

 soft papillae above and 16 below, all nearly fan-shaped and folicaeous 

 in this specimen, l:)ut probably collapsed. A pair of stout jaw-plates 

 abo^'e and below are suljtriangular, each bearing at the anterior angle 

 a blimt claw-like tooth followed on the lateral border by a dentinal 

 ridge. At the base of the proboscis, on the dorsal surface between 

 the bases of the palpi, is a single prominent tubercle. 



The peristomium is scarcely evident as a distinct ring, being com- 

 pletely united with the prostomium and succeeding somite. From the 

 dorsum of the latter (II) arises a prominent nuchal fold similar to but 

 larger than that of Halosydna gelaiinosa. It is subtriangular, attached 

 by its posterior border but otherwise free, and conceals the entire pos- 

 terior and middle ]3ortions of the head. It can be drawn forward 

 so as to cover much more than shown in the figure. 



Generally the segments are well differentiated and about 4 times as 

 Avide as long. The ne])hridial tuljercles are prominent, begin on somite 

 XII and project outward and baclcward. Parapodia are much elon- 

 gated, c^uite equalling f of the width of the boch'. The neuropodia are 

 strongly predominant, broad and truncate at the ends, with a pointed 

 somewhat membranous presetal lobe which conceals the end of the 

 aciculum. The notopodia are small and very slender; the}- arise from 

 the middle of the dorsal surface of the neuropodia and enclose a slender 

 aciculum. Dorsal cirri arise just above the notopodia, from large stout 

 bases having a prominent glandular lobe. Their styles are long, about 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 543 



equailing the width of the body without the parapodia; they taper 

 regularly, then suddenly to a terminal filament, and reach far beyond 

 the end of the foot itself to the tips of the elongated setae; no cilia or 

 papillse are borne on the surface. These cirri are confined to the seg- 

 ments lacking elytra at the anterior end and all are of equal length. 

 Ventral cirri occur on all segments. They arise from about the middle 

 of the ventral surface of the neuropodium and reach nearly to the tip 

 of the presetal lobe. In form they are rather stout and conical with a 

 short terminal filament. That borne on II has a large ceratophore and 

 a style resembling the dorsal cirri in form and size. The next one has 

 no ceratophore and the style is abovit half as long, while succeeding ojies 

 regularly dhninish in length until the normal is attained. At the pos- 

 terior end the parapodia diminish in size and the ventral cirri are rela- 

 tively much longer. The caudal cirri are similar to the dorsal cirri and 

 equal the last 9 segments. 



Elytra are probably more numerous than in any other species of the 

 family. They occur on II, IV, V, VII, IX, XI, XIII, XV, XVII, XIX, 

 XXI, XXIII, XXVI, XXIX, XXX, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXV, 

 XXXVI, XXXVIII, and then on every somite for 79, leaving only 3 

 or 4 very small somites at the caudal end doubtful, though these cer- 

 tainly bear no dorsal cirri. It is true that a majority of the elytra are 

 detached and lost, but in several cases they remain on 3 or 4 successive 

 segments. There is, moreover, no mistaking the elytrophores, which 

 are thick, prominent and wrinkled, with swollen margins surrounding 

 the scars. The continuous presence of elytra is further indicated by 

 the total absence of dorsal cirri from this region. Even on the cir- 

 riferous somites there is a broad dorsal tubercle with a slightly free 

 margin. It is barely possible that this specimen may be abnormal, 

 but the constancy and regular, paired arrangement of the elytrophores 

 render this extremely improbable. A very few cases were noted in 

 which the elytrophores and elytra were of smaller size than usual. The 

 elytra are of a very soft gelatinous texture, of large size, with nearly 

 central scar, and the margin is broadly lobed and so folded as to draw 

 the elytron into a funnel form. Both those of the same pairs and on 

 contiguous somites are curiously adherent over the back, forming a sort 

 of irregular roof. The adhesion results from a gritty substance, perhaps 

 an extraneous deposit, perhaps a secretion, but apparently not due 

 solely to the method of preparation, as other species contained in the 

 same bottle are free from it. 



The dorsal surface of the body generally, the head and its appendages 

 and the proboscis are raisin color; the elytra are more or less tinged 




544 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Ju]y, 



with the same. Owing to their being distended with eggs the parapod i a 

 are dull yellowish. The entire ventral surface is dirty white. 



The setse seen in mass are of a pale yellow color. The notopodials 

 (fig. 29) arise from the base of the prolonged acicular process and spread 

 horizontally. They are very long and slender, capillary, nearly straight, 

 tapered regularly from the base and smooth or with barely discernible 

 marginal denticulations and oblique striations. Although the noto- 

 podium is well developed on II, III, and IV, it bears no setse on these 

 somites; the extreme posterior ones are very small. The neuro- 

 podial setse form a large vertical tuft and are of two forms. Those 

 dorsal to the aciculum have slightly enlarged ends more or less denticu- 

 late and pectinate and tapering to simple pointed tips. The dorsal- 

 most are slender with long capillary tips and very fine pectination. 

 The ventral ones are much coarser, with shorter and more conspicu- 

 ously pectinated tips (fig. 28). The subacicular setae have bifid tips 

 (figs. 26,27). They are rather abruptly enlarged at the end. rather 

 stout, strongly curved and conspicuously pectinated. The bifid tip has 

 the stout limb beak-like and the slender one bent toward it or even 

 hooked. 



The type and only known specimen comes from station 4,198, in 

 157 to 230 fathoms, on Halibut Bank, in the Gulf of Georgia. 



Lepidonotus robustus sp. nov. PI. XXXVI, figs. 32-35. 



Founded upon a single example, which the label describes as taken 

 from a hermit crab, this species bears a striking superficial resemblance 

 to the similarly commensalistic Eunoe depressa. The type is of rela- 

 tively large size and robust Ijuild, measuring 40 mm. long, 13 mm. wide 

 between the tips of the parapodia of X and about 8 mm. deep. 



Without including the tentacular prolongations the prostomium is 

 about f as long as wide, the posterior border straight and somewhat 

 concealed by a fold of the succeeding somite, the lateral surfaces bulging 

 into ocular prominences behind the middle and converging thence grad- 

 ually into the lateral borders of the tentacular prolongations. The 

 latter are of the usual form, slightly divergent, and as long as the body 

 of the prostomium. There are two pairs of eyes, prominent, black, 

 circular and lenseless. The anterior are much the larger, situated on 

 the lateral swellings and look outward, forward and upward. The 

 posterior pair are near the posterior border and directed upward. 



All cephalic appendages are short and stout and lack cilia and 

 papillse. The middle tentacle has a short, very stout base somewhat 

 ventral to the tentacular prolongations with which it is largely coa- 

 lesced; its style is about IJ times the length of the prostomium with 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 545 



its tentacular processes, and tapers from a broad base to the abruptly 

 contracted tip which is not longer than the basal diameter and scarcely 

 filamentous. The tentacular processes are largely united along the 

 medial face with the base of the median tentacle, their tips only being 

 free for a short distance; the style is similar to the median one, but 

 somewhat more slender, slightly shorter, and with a longer terminal 

 filament having a length of fully twice the basal diameter. The 

 palpi are very stout, bulge widely beyond the sides of the prostomium 

 at the base, and taper abruptly at the end to a short, acute appendage, 

 five longitudinal lines extend for their entire length. On the two sides 

 the dorsal tentacular cirri are of very unequal length, one exceeding 

 the median tentacle, the other being considerably shorter than the 

 lateral tentacle, which is just equalled by the ventral tentacular cirri 

 of both sides; in form they are similar to the median tentacle. The 

 mouth is large with very rugous lips. 



There are 26 segments, all of which are broad and stout, and the 

 posterior ones relatively little reduced, though the body is clearly com- 

 plete. Nephridial papillae begin on VHI and continue to XXVI; they 

 are elongated, the basal half adnate, the distal half free and curved 

 outward and upward between the parapodia. The caudal cirri are 

 similar to the dorsal cirri, but more tapered and longer, equalling the 

 last 4 segments. 



Typical parapodia (fig. 35) are very short and thick, those in the 

 middle region about | the width of the body. The neuropodium is 

 obliquely truncate with a very short presetal acicular process near the 

 dorsal angle. The notopodium is a small, rather slender lobe on the 

 antero-dorsal face of the neuropodium and is divided into a prolonged 

 acicular process and a setigerous papilla. The ventral cirrus arises from 

 a rather stout ceratophore near the base of the neuropodium, and its style 

 tapers to a slender tip which reaches slightly beyond the end of the 

 ventral border of the neuropodium. The dorsal cirrus has a very large 

 tapering ceratophore borne partlj^ on the postero-dorsal portion of the 

 parapodium and partly on the bod}" wall and reaching beyond the end 

 of the notopodium ; the style has the form of the lateral tentacles and 

 extends beyond the tips of the longest sette. The last dorsal cirrus is 

 borne on the posterior face of its parapodium and tapers more regularly 

 from base to tip than the others. The ventral cirrus of II resembles in 

 form and size the ventral tentacular cirrus. 



There are 12 pairs of elytra (fig. 32) situated as usual in the genus. 

 Notwithstanding their large size they fail to cover the broad back, 

 which is largely exposed along the middle. All, including those appa- 




516 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [J^lv, 



rently of the first pair which are detached, are somewhat irregularly 

 qua(lratel>''"o\'ate. thick and of a soft, somewhat gelatinoid texture. 

 Their margins are somewhat folded and irregular but without trace of 

 cilia or sensory papillae. The exposed surface is somewhat irregular, 

 the white spots being somewhat raised, but there are no spines or 

 papilla? of any kind. The narrow, transversely elongated area of 

 attachment is situated nearest to the anterior and lateral borders. 



Neuropodial setae form a dense fascicle arranged in 3 supraacicular 

 and 7 subacicular horizontal series. They vary but little, are rather 

 stout but less thickened at the end than in many species ; the pectinated 

 region (fig. 33) is rather extensive and the smooth tip relatively short 

 and strongly hooked. The notopodials (fig. 34) are a close tuft of 

 rather stiff, acutely tapered setae marked with close transverse rows of 

 fine teeth. The peristomial parapodium bears a notopodial process 

 with a small tuft of setae on one side, but lacks it on the other. 



Except for a median series of dull brown spots, one on the posterior 

 margin of each segment, the body is colorless. The cephalic and caudal 

 appendages are all deep brown with white tips, the dorsal cirri with but 

 little l:)rown and the ventral cirri white. The elytra are reddish-brown 

 and white. No pigment is found along the anterior border or on an 

 extensive area anterior to and laterad of this scar. A transverse 

 area of clear reddish-brown passes from j\ist in front of the scar to 

 the median border and is concealed by the preceding scale; from 

 this a mottled brown and white area spreads to and along the median 

 and posterior borders, the brown predominating medially, where it is 

 marked by small, round, discrete white spots, w^hile laterally the white 

 becomes predominant owing to the increase in size, number and con- 

 fluence of the spots. On many elytra there is a narrow, scarcely broken 

 posterior Ijorder of brown. The round white spots are slightly raised, 

 and in the center of each is a small yellowish opaque pigment spot or 

 excretophore. 



The only known specimen was taken from a hermit crab at station 

 4.291. 48 to 65 fathoms, in t^hehkof Strait. 

 Lepidonotus oaeloris Moore. PI. XXXVI. figs. 36, 37. 



This species, originally described from specimens dredged off the 

 coast of Japan, proves to be one of the most abund-ant and generally 

 distributed species throughout the region covered by these explorations. 

 It represents in the Pacific the widely spread L. squamatus of the At- 

 lantic, and in the younger stages resembles that species more closely, 

 but with increasing age and size the fringe of elytral hairs becomes more 

 restricted and the posterior detached tuft is lost. At the same time 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 547 



the differences in the sculpturing and form of the papilla:; and the char- 

 acter of the neuropodial cirri become more marked. Many of the speci- 

 mens are of a nearly black color. 

 Ninoe simpla sp. nov. PI. XXXV, fig. 30; XXXVI, figs. 39-44. 



This species has much the form, general aspect and usual size of 

 Ninoe nigripes ^^errill, but none of the examples in this collection 

 reaches the ma.Kimum size of the latter. The body is very fragile and 

 no specimen is nearly complete and none represents the caudal end. 

 The most perfect example, hence designated as the type, consists of 

 160 segments and is 24 mm. long and 1.3 mm. in diameter. Other 

 larger ones, having a diameter up to 2.5 nun., are less complete. 



The prostomium has a slightly depressed sugar-loaf shape, with a 

 length about ^ greater than the basal width. Posteriorly its median 

 dorsal portion is inserted into an overarched recess of the peristomium 

 and here bears a pair of minute brown eyespots, behind which one or 

 two others are sometimes visible. Within this same recess, but some- 

 times projecting slightly beyond the peristomial fold, is a minute 

 mammiliform process (median tentacle) with a thickened base em- 

 braced by a pair of slight lateral folds. Two symmetrical dorso-lateral 

 longitudinal grooves join the sides of this recess posteriorly, and proba- 

 bly enter the deep slit-like nuchal organs seen on each side by raising 

 or dissecting off the peristomial covering. A similar pair of more dis- 

 tinct ventro-lateral grooves join the ends of a deep transverse slit 

 bounding the palpi anteriorly. The palpi are a pair of small rounded 

 lobes facing each other on each side of a deep longitudinal groove and 

 sunk into a depression on the ventral surface of the prostomium or 

 between the latter and the mouth. A rather small mouth is boimded 

 anteriorly and dorsally by these palpi and posteriorly and ventrally by 

 the peristomium. 



Except for the special features already indicated the peristomhim is 

 exactly like the following segment and, also like it, is apodous. 

 Anteriorly the body is slightly flattened and increases in width to the 

 end of the branchial region, behind which it again narrows and becomes 

 perfectly terete. 



Parapodia (figs. 39 and 40) are absent from the peristomium and 

 following somite. Beginning on III they are at first small and placed 

 at a low level, but gradually rise to a middle height and become more 

 prominent in the branchial region, behind which they again decrease 

 in size, but retain the more elevated position. Throughout they are 

 uniramous, the notopodium being a mere tubercle bearing sensory hairs 

 and entered by delicate aciculae reduced to mere fibres. The prominent 




548 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [-IuIVj 



neuropoclium divides distally into presetal and postsetal lobes, of which 

 the former is short and broadly rounded and without any appendage 

 to about XX, wdien a small papilla appears projecting freely from its 

 anterior and distal margin directly outward or slightly ventrad. This 

 increases in size for several somites, but becomes again greatly reduced 

 by XLV. The postsetal lobe is always much more prominent ; on the 

 first few somites it is rather narrowly foliaceous and strongly curved 

 dorsad, ending in a blunt apex; by somite IX it has become much 

 broader, fully equals in length the base of the parapodium and bears a 

 small but distinct branchial process on the dorsal border near the end. 

 From this point the branchial process increases rapidly in length and 

 becomes somewhat broad and flattened, while the postsetal lobe itself 

 becomes gradually wider (deeper) and shorter, until by XXII it no 

 longer reaches beyond the presetal lobe. At this point the branchial 

 process fully equals the rest of the parapodium in length and projects 

 prominently directly upward. Both the foliaceous margin of the post- 

 setal lobe and its process have an open structure and are richly vascular 

 and they undoubtedly serve as gills. Posterior to XLV the branchiae 

 are so reduced that the foot (fig. 40) consists only of a tapering base 

 bearing small conical divergent presetal and postsetal lobes which 

 become still further reduced toward the caudal end. 



Anteriorly each parapodium is supported by three black aciculse 

 which are curved and tapered distally and terminate in an acute pale- 

 colorecl tip projecting freely beyond the surface. Posterior parapodia 

 have but two (fig. 41) . The setre are of two forms, one winged and with 

 acute tips, the other hooded crochets. The former (fig. 42) have black 

 bases and pale yellow exposed portions, are sigmoidly curved, provided 

 with a delicate wing and taper to very acute tips. They vary some- 

 what in length, curvatiu'e and extent of the border. The crochets (fig. 

 43) are black or deep brown throughout, strongly striated, very slightly 

 enlarged distally and then contracted to a scarcely hooked tip provided 

 with five teeth, of which the lowermost greatly exceeds the others in size. 

 The hood consists of the usual pair of delicate striated pieces which 

 embrace the end of the crochet and conform to its shape. Most of 

 the setse are broken, but enough can be made out of a comparison of all 

 the specimens to show that acute setee alone, to the number of about 

 12 or 14 arranged in a fan-shaped fascicle, are found in the anterior 

 parapodia. The number gradually diminishes and about the middle of 

 the branchial region crochets appear and continue in association with 

 the acute setse throughout the middle region, while posteriorly 3 or 4 

 crochets alone remain. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 549 



The dissected jaws are shown in ventral view in fig. 44. With the 

 exception of the mandibles they are dark brown. The maxilhe are 

 slender, very strongly curved and acutely pointed ; their expanded and 

 excavated bases are borne on separate carriers which are deeply emar- 

 ginated about the middle of the outer margin, but have the contiguous 

 but distinct median margin straight. A narrow horny bow extends 

 from the lateral and distal angle of each carrier to the corresponding 

 second dorsal jaw. There are 3 pairs of dorsal jaws. The large pos- 

 terior pair are broadly arcuate, connected posteriorly with the maxillae 

 carriers by a narrow bar and bear 5 or 6 acute, strongly curved teeth 

 and a blunt tubercle. The second pair are triangular, with smooth 

 sides and a single stout claw-like apical tooth. The anterior are similar, 

 but with the base rather trapezoidal in shape. Unlike the other jaws 

 the mandibles (fig. 30) are white with longitudinal streaks of pale 

 brown, the distal margin wide and irregularly denticulate, with a promi- 

 nent lateral angle and the base slender. They are very hard and brittle. 



N. simpla differs widely from all described species of Ninoe known 

 to me in the form of the gills and the presence of the mammiliform tu- 

 bercle or rudimentary median tentacle on the prostomium. The 

 branchial process corresponds to the dorsal limb of the gill of A'^. nigripes, 

 N. palmata, etc., but the palmate gill of these species is wanting, though 

 its base is represented by the expanded portion of the postsetal lobe. 



This species was taken in Behm Canal, Alaska, only, at stations 4,235, 

 4,236 and 4,238, on muddy bottoms, in 130 to 229 fathoms. 



Goniada annulata sp. nov. PI. XXXVI, figs. 45 to 48. 



The length of mature specimens considerably contracted in alcohol 

 is from 70 to 90 mm., the greatest width to the tips of the parapodia 

 (not including setse) about 3 mm. The prostomium, which is broadly 

 coalesced with the peristomium at the base, is depressed and about 

 twice as long as its basal width or about equal to the first 6 or 7 somites; 

 it is distinctly divided into 5 rings, of which the first equals the total 

 of the others which successively diminish in both length and breadth, 

 the last being minute and apparently sometimes absent. A wavy 

 longitudinal groove on each side of the head is joined by the transverse 

 furrows, which do not correspond above and below, and meets the 

 nuchal organs behind ; there is also a faint longitudinal ventral furrow. 

 The apical tentacles diverge diagonally from the tip of the prostomium ; 

 the dorsal pair, which are slightly the longer, about equalling the trans- 

 verse diameter of the last ring. Eyes appear to be absent. The palpi 

 are small, low, rovmded, immobile and widely separated on each side of 

 the mouth. 




550 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



The peristomium is fused with the prostoniiiim above and the second 

 somite below, where also it is produced forward as a rather prominent 

 median lip. In complete sexually mat\n'e worms there are from loO 

 to 160 somites, of which all but 59 or 60 constitute the posterior or 

 genital region. Especially in the anterior region the segments are well 

 defined, smooth and terete, increasing in length to about XXX, and 

 in width more gradually to XL, where they are about 3 times as wide 

 as long; from that point to IJX or LX they remain nearly unchanged 

 in proportions or even somewhat contracted, except when distended 

 with ova or sperm, when they suddenly expand. In immature speci- 

 mens this change does not take place. At this point there is internally 

 a strong development of radiating muscles to which the constriction is 

 due, and which form a Ijar to the movement of the genital products for- 

 ward. On the other hand, the muscles of the body w^alls are somewhat 

 Weakened and one specimen is actually broken in two exactly at this 

 point. This species, therefore, presents a condition similar to that 

 described for Goniada foliacea, which it otherwise closely resembles in 

 many respects. The posterior region is somewhat depressed, an ap- 

 pearance that is much exaggerated by the prominence of the parapodia, 

 especially as the body decreases in width posteriorly. In only one 

 specimen is the caudal cirrus preserved ; it arises below' the anus and is 

 slender, tapering, and as long as the last 9 segments. 



Anterior to XXXIII or XXXIV the parapodia are uniramous, be- 

 hind that point biramous. The former (fig. 45) consist of an elongated 

 neuropodium terminated by a presetal lobe divided by a deep cleft into 

 slender, nearly conical dorsal and ventral lingulse and an undivided 

 presetal lobe of similarly slender form and nearly equal length. The 

 ventral cirri are prominent, with swollen bases united to the ventral 

 margin of the neuropodiimi and followed by a slight constriction, be- 

 yond w^hich is a short conical style. Dorsal cirri arise a little above and 

 behind the neuropodium. They have prominent but generally rela- 

 tively slender bases and broadly ovate foliaceous distal portions bent 

 abruptly dorsad. Beyond a gradual increase in size of all parts, espe- 

 cialh'- the dorsal cirrus and postsetal lobe, relatively little change takes 

 place from before backward. The base of the dorsal cirrus is relatively 

 thickest from X to XX. On the first two parapodia the presetal 

 lobe is undivided and the postsetal altogether absent; on the next 

 3 the latter increases to its normal proportions. 



At XXXIII or XXXIV the notopoclium appears somewhat suddenly 

 and immediately bears setae. It consists of an acutely conical presetal 

 lobe and a minute rather ventral postsetal tubercle and is nearly half 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 551 



as long as the neviropodium. From the point of its appearance caii- 

 dally the notopodium and all other parts of the foot gradually increase 

 in size and become foliaceous, especially the neuropodial lobes and the 

 notopodial cirrus. At I.IX or LX the entire parapodium suddenly 

 becomes larger and more folicaeous, without, however, any change in 

 its fundamental characteristics. It is at this point that the posterior 

 genital region with its swimming setae begins. In a typical parapodium 

 of this region (fig. 46) both notopodium and neiu'opodium are large and 

 well separated. The former is the smaller and consists of a presetal 

 lobe broad at the base and with a nearly conical terminal portion and 

 a short, broad, presetal lobe situated somewhat ventrally. The cirrus 

 arises from the dorsal base and a little posterior to the notopodium, has 

 a relatively narrow but flattened base bent abruptly dorsad and bearing 

 a broadly orbicular style, the whole slightly exceeding the notopodium 

 in length. The neuropodium is comprised of the same parts as ante- 

 riorly, but the lo]:)es are very much broader and more foliaceous in 

 character; the two presetal ones are terminated by abruptly sjender 

 tips, while the postsetal lobe is both broader and blunt-pointed, as well 

 as shorter. The neuropodial cirrus is closely united with the base of 

 the neuropodium and tapers to an acute conical point reaching about 

 half way to the end of the neuropodium. The characters of the foot 

 become emphasized to at least LXXX, behind which the parts dimin- 

 ish gradually in size, the dorsal cirri alone remaining prominent to the 

 end but becoming narrower. Numerous large ova or aggregations of 

 spermatozoa are seen in parapodia of this region, but none anteriorly. 

 Both notopodium and neuropodiimi are each supported by a single 

 large tapering acicula. Setae are of two forms — compound in the neuro- 

 podium and simple in the notopodium. Both closely resemble those 

 of G. foliacea. The former are arranged in a vertical fan-shaped fascicle 

 and vary in number with the size of the neuropodium. They are color- 

 less, with usually strongly curved shafts terminated by oblique sockets, 

 and bear delicate, nearly straight or curved, acutely pointed and super- 

 ficially granulated ])lades. They increase in length both ways to the 

 middle of the fascicle and in the posterior region both shafts and blades 

 are greatly elongated, the exposed parts equalling h the width of the 

 body, while the longest in the anterior region are not more than ^ or A 

 the corresponding dimension. Simple setae appear with the notopodia 

 and, like the compound, are arranged in a vertically spreading fascicle 

 composed of never more than about 10 setae, of which 3 or 4 are ventral 

 to the acicula. They are colorless, shorter than the compound setae 

 and about twice as thick, slightly curved and rather abruptly tapered 




552 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Juty; 



to an acute point. Like the compound seise they are superficially 

 granulated and they are much elongated in the genital region. 



A majority of the specimens have the proboscis protruded to various 

 degrees, one to a length of 16 mm., but in no case as far as the jaws. 

 It increases slightly in diameter from the base distally, where it may 

 equal 1.5 mm. in diameter. In the best preserved examples it is fluted 

 longitudinally by about 18 parallel muscular ridges. The entire sur- 

 face is covered thickly with stiff cuticular papillte arranged rather 

 regularly in longitudinal rows, to correspond with the ridges. These 

 papillffi are of various sizes, varying from .065 mm. to .02 mm. in height, 

 but chiefly divided into a large and a small set, of which the former 

 crown the ridges and the latter occupy the furrows. These papillae (fig. 

 48) are colorless and stiffened by a thick striated cuticle, have broad 

 trilobate bases with the paired lobe forward and the elevated portion a 

 broad-based, pointed and slightly hooked cone, the cuticular covering 

 of which has a deep cleft running up the anterior face and terminating 

 in a pore near the apex. 



In the retracted state of the proboscis the position of the jaws varies 

 from somite XXXVH to XLII. The jaws are black and ^'ery hard, the 

 principal pair nearer together ventrally than dorsallj-. The latter 

 (fig. 47a) bear 3 or 4 large claw-like fangs which diminish in size medi- 

 ally and point caudal. The accessory jaws are of much smaller and 

 variable size, the dorsal arch containing 14 to 16 besides a few very 

 minute ones. They (fig. 476) have bases Avhich are deeply bilobate 

 anteriorly and broadly unilobate behind, and usually bear a pair of 

 equal divergent claws but sometimes 3 or 1. The ventral jaws are 

 similar and 7 or 8 in number and with the others form an unbroken ring. 

 Anterior to this ring is the jaw sheath consisting of a circle of about 18 

 soft papillce. The chevron-shaped jaws form lateral longitudinal 

 series of about 20 at the base of the extended proboscis. As the largest 

 ones occur in the middle of each series and smaller ones at the ends, 

 they form elongated elliptical areas tailing out behind where several 

 quite rudimentary denticles occur. 



Considerable individual variation is exhibited in the colors, which 

 have resisted the solvent action of the alcohol c[uite well. Generally 

 the ground is a yellowish-brown, showing a strong tendency to an annu- 

 lar arrangement in the anterior region where the furrows are pale. 

 Posteriorly it is generally darker and more imiform. Most specimens 

 are more or less blotched or even strongly annulated anteriorly with 

 dark purplish-brown, and each segment in the genital region is marked 

 by a, sometimes very conspicuous, pigment spot at the posterior mar- 

 gin in the median ventral line. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 553 



iVIost of the specimens are sexually mature and have the posterior 

 region distended with eggs or sperm. A couple of immature examples 

 35 mm. long have parapodia of the usual form, but the distinction 

 between genital and pregenital regions is slight and there are no 

 swimming setae. 



Goniada annulata is a quite common species from Halibut Bank, in 

 the Gulf of Georgia, northAvard to Chatham Strait. There it occm'S in 

 282 to 293 fathoms at station 4,264. The type comes from station 

 4,235 in Behm Canal, where in 90 fathoms the species occurs at the least 

 depth recorded.

FIVE NEW SPECIES OF PSEUDOPOTAMILLA FROM THE PACIFIC COAST OF 



NORTH AMERICA. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



A noteworthy portion of the Polychseta collections of the Alaskan 

 Salmon Commission of 1903 is seven species, five of which are herein 

 described as new. of the genus Pseudopotamilla recenth^ established 

 by Miss Bush. These new species are of interest in indicating the 

 interrelations of Pseudopotamilla and other genera into which the 

 former tends to grade. In most respects P. intermedia is most typical, 

 and stands between the other species, which may be grouped in couples 

 having quite distinct affinities. On the one hand P. hrevihranchiata 

 and P. occelata approach Eudistylia in the structure of the collar, and 

 the former especially in the uncini and the latter in the numerous eyes 

 and general habit. Neither of these, however, shows any indication 

 of spiral coiling of the branchial bases, which are small and simple. 

 On the other hand, P. splendida and P. anoculata have the angulated 

 branchial stems without eyes and the more elongated spatulate tho- 

 racic setfe which characterize Parasahella and Sabella, but the dorsal 

 collar lobes are exceptionally well developed and the branchial bases 

 are very small and simple. The first three species have the avicular 

 uncini of the posterior thoracic segments enlarged and otherwise pecu- 

 liar, in this respect resembling P. oculifera Leidy. 

 Pseudopotamilla brevibranchiata sp. nov. PL XXXVII, figs. 1 to 7. 



A species remarkable for the shortness of its branchise and the con- 

 spicuousness of its eyes. Two specimens containing nearly mature 

 ova measure 55 and 58 mm. long and have 128 and 151 segments 

 respectively. Of this length the palpi and branchial crown measure 

 only 6 to 6.5 mm. and the thorax 8 mm. Owing to the contraction of 

 the abdomen the form is rather short and stout, but the posterior -J 

 tapers in the usual way to the small pygidium, which bears a close 

 aggregation of small brown eye spots dorsal to the anus. 



The palpi or branchial bases are very firm and rigid, not at all pro- 

 duced ventrally nor spirally twisted, though slightl}- inflected and 

 winged ; the distal margin is even and transverse and the height uniform 

 (about 1.5 mm.) all round. The dorsal free margin bears a rather 

 prominent, rigid, slightly incvuved wing which overlaps its fellow 

 36 




^56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



medially and is separated by a deep, narrow incision from a similar 

 but thinner wing borne upon the base of the dorsalmost branchial stem. 

 Including a few rudimentary ventral ones and several in process of 

 regeneration at other points, the number of branchia varies from 29 

 to 31. ^ Owing to excessive crowding some of them are forced inward, 

 producing an appearance of two series. The stems or radioles are re- 

 markably short, stout, rigid and brittle and, without considering the 

 rudimentary and regenerating ones, increase gradually in length from 

 ventral to dorsal, the latter being about i longer than fullv developed 

 ventral ones. Although the outer face is round, the basal J or so, dis- 

 tally to the position of the first eye, bears a pair of very low lateral 

 wmgs or margins which are united for a very short distance at the 

 base. Beyond this point the stems are laterally compressed. The 

 barbs are also thick and brittle, closely two-ranked, and all short, the 

 longest proximal ones not exceeding 3 times the diameter of the stem 

 and the distal ones being much shorter. A\rhen fully developed they 

 continue nearly to the end, leaving free a short thick tip only. Eyes 

 are exclusively in one series on the side of the stem nearest to the dorso- 

 median line. They are deep purplish-brown and very conspicuous, 

 and confined to a zone comprising the middle half of the branchiaj, but 

 most irregularly arranged on individual branchiie, on which they seldom 

 occupy the entire width of the zone, though they may be variously 

 scattered, or crowded into one or more groups. The usual number has 

 4 or 5, but varies from 2 to 9, and they may equal ^ the diameter of 

 the stem or be minute, scarcely visible specks, and all or any number 

 may be large or small. 



A high oral membrane with rumpled, sinuous margins begins ven- 

 trally at the sides of the mouth, is reflected on itself and passes around 

 the internal bases of the branchias to become continuous dorsally with 

 the large, much folded, foliaceous tentacles. 



The peristomial collar differs considerably from the structm-e typical 

 of the genus, as exemplified by P. reniformis and P. oculifera, and indi- 

 cates the method of transition between forms with the collar lobes 

 widely separated and those with them in contact dorsally. The dorsal 

 portion consists of a pair of very low folds reflected into the dorsal 

 fissure and there coming into contact. These are continuous with the 

 remainder of the coUar which rises abruptly into a pair of rounded lobes 

 just above the collar setae. From this point it is high and regular to 

 near the median ventral region, M^here a wide open notch on each side 

 partly separates the slender, pointed ventral lobes which are divided 

 from each other by the deep ventral fissure. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 557 



Besides the peristomiiim there are S setigerous thoracic somites,"alI 

 uniannulate and separated by deep segmental furrows. The region is 

 nearly cylindrical, but slightly depressed and from 3 to 3.5 mm. wide. 

 The 8 ventral glandular plates, including the first, are all transversely 

 oblong and the second and third only are divided transversely into 2 

 equal halves. Abdominal somites are also uniannulate and the pos- 

 terior ones much crowded. Thick ventral plates are developed 

 throughout the region and are divided into halves by a deep faecal 

 groove extending from the anus to the first abdominal segment, cutting 

 the latter oblic^uely to the right and entering the thoracico-abdominal 

 fm-row in front of the setae, then appearing again faintly in the dorsal 

 mid-line of the thorax and entering the dorsal fissure. 



Thoracic parapodia are strictly lateral and the uncinigerous tori 

 flush with the surface, while the setigerous tubercles may project 

 slightly or be retracted within little pockets. The collar setse form a 

 very small tuft and the remaining 7 fascicles are somewhat elongated 

 laterally and oblique. On all thoracic somites the uncinigerous tori 

 are separated ventrally by about ^ and dorsally by nearly or quite h the 

 body circumference. They increase in length gradually to the third 

 which equals the ventral interspace, then decrease to the last which 

 is f of the longest, while the first equals the fifth or sixth. As the tori 

 shorten the setae tufts, closely approximated to their dorsal ends, 

 assume a correspondingly lower position. Abdominal parapodia are 

 more prominent and distinct lateral elevations, highest at the position 

 of the setsD tufts near their ventral ends. The anterior tori are, like 

 the thoracic ones, nearly flush with the surface and are consequently 

 transitional, but, like all of the others, they are separated from the 

 ventral plates by a deep longitudinal groove. Both setae and uncini 

 are in strictly vertical, linear series. On the first abdominal segment 

 the former has a length of about + that of the setaD tuft, and the latter 

 equals the uncinigerous torus of the last thoracic somite. From this 

 point both gradually diminish in length and number of setae or uncini 

 to the caudal end. At the dorsal end of each thoracic and the ventral 

 end of each abdominal torus is a small, eye-like pigment spot. 



In the collar tuft all setae are capillary, winged, lanceolate, the ven- 

 tral ones, however, shorter and with wider wings than the dorsal. On 

 the remaining thoracic somites the setay are of two sorts; a few in the 

 dorsal and anterior part of the fascicle resemble the collar setae (fig. 

 1), the number of which decreases from anterior segments backward. 

 Those in the ventral and posterior portions of the bundle form a com- 

 pact phalanx of several rows of obovate paddle-shaped or spatulate 




558 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Julj, 



setffi with miicronate tips and the broad blades curved and often 

 slightly asymmetrical (fig. 3). Abdominal setse are all capillary with 

 the shaft bent at the widest portion of the short double asymmetrical 

 blades. They are arranged in two vertical rows, those in the anterior 

 (fig. 2) having very long, attenuated, smooth tips, the posterior much 

 shorter but otherwise similar. Their number varies from 24 in ante- 

 rior to 4 or 5 in posterior fascicles. All setae are distinctly striated. 



Thoracic tori bear avicular uncini in the posterior and pick-shaped 

 setse in the anterior rank, the number of each on somite VI being 65 

 and on IX 40, The former (fig. 4) have a rather long slender base, 

 narrow but prominent breast, thick erect neck, and little expanded 

 head, with the prominent, finely divided crest pushed well forward and 

 its frontal margin forming a perfectly straight profile with the acute 

 beak, which is just perceptibly bent forward at the tip. On the pos- 

 terior thoracic somites the uncini are somewhat larger, but the differ- 

 ence is not so great as in P. occelata and P. intermedia; the neck is also 

 more craned forward and there are other slight peculiarities. The lat- 

 ter (figs. 6 and 7) have slender, finely striated stems slightly curved near 

 the end, and expanded into a coarsely striated head enclosed in a sheath 

 inflated at the base, and prolonged nearly at right angles to the stem into 

 a moderately elongated slender process. Abdominal tori contain 

 avicular uncini only (fig. 5), smaller than the thoracic uncini which they 

 resem.ble in many respects, but have much the form of the wooden 

 decoys used in duck shooting. 



Except for the caudal eyes, the minute spots at the ends of the tori 

 and a trace of brown on the median dorsal portion of the collar, no 

 pigment exists on the bod}'', which is of a pale yellowish color. On one 

 specimen the basal half of the branchial wreath has no pigment, but 

 in the distal half are four partly coalescent bands of brown, not extend- 

 ing on to the back of the stems, but deep-colored on the sides of the 

 latter and the basal half of the barbs. Wlien the branchise are opened 

 up the barbs of the concealed branchiae are found to be of a beautiful 

 orange in those parts from which pigment is absent. The second speci- 

 men has very little pigment showing on the exterior except narrow 

 longitudinal streaks of brown on the branchial base corresponding with 

 the intervals between branchiae. When opened up the distal half of 

 the branchiae shows traces of orange on the barbs, while the basal half 

 is of a nearly solid orange brown. 



The tubes are rather thick, tough and horn l^rown, and are thickly 

 covered with fine sand; the free end is collapsible for a considerable 

 distance.

This species presents an interesting combination of characters' which 

 weaken one's faith in the adequacy of some recent generic definitions. 

 Indeed, it is doubtful whether this species should not go into the'genus 

 Eudistyla. The entire structure of the collar agrees closely with Miss 

 Bush's description of the organ in that genus; the uncini and setae 

 are almost counterparts, and Johnson's figures of those of Eudistyla 

 (Bispira) polymoiyha, with which the preliminary determination associ- 

 ated these specimens, would answer almost equally well for the present 

 species. The eyes and the dorsal wings of the palpi or branchiarbases 

 are also features of similarity. But the absence of any pronounced 

 ventral prolongation of the branchial bases and the total absence of a 

 spiral twist to the latter, in the writer's Ofjinion, more than overbalance 

 those more trivial characters. The shortness of the branchiae may 

 suggest the possibility of their having been injured and in process of 

 regeneration, but a careful study has brought to light many reasons for 

 rejecting this view. • 



The type and co-type were taken July 11, 1903, at station 4,247 in 

 Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales Island, in 95-114 fathoms, in a bottom 

 of mixed mud, sand and broken shells. 



Pseudopotamilla occelata sp. nov. PI. XXXVII, figs. 8 to 14. 



From the other species described in this paper the present is distin- 

 guished by its great length and numerous and conspicuous eyes. The 

 type measiu-es 130 mm., of which the branchiae are 18 mm. and the 

 thorax 11 mm. long. A still larger specimen from the same station 

 is nearty 20 mm. longer. 



The branchial bases are stiff, high and prominent, of uniform height, 

 provided dorsally with notched wings, and ventrally with a slightly 

 involute thin membrane. Full-grown specimens possess 21 to 24 

 pairs of branchiae, small ones 60 mm. long from 17 to 20. They are 

 moderately long, the dorsal somewhat exceeding the ventral, and en- 

 tirely without a connecting membrane. The stems are rather stout, 

 rounded externally and provided with a slightly raised line on each 

 margin just external to the bases of the barbs. The latter are rather 

 short and well separated toward the base of the stems, but near the 

 distal end become very slender, about three times as long as the bksal 

 ones and much crowded, leaving a very short thick tip of the stem 

 which also bears minute budding barbs of decreasing length almost to 

 the extreme end. 



Very conspicuous are the rich dark brown eyes, which are very uni- 

 form in size and large (about ^ the diameter of the stem), elevated and 

 bulging; all are on the margin of the external surface that lies nearest 




560 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



to'the dorso-median line when the branchiae are spread. They'exhibit 

 the usual irregularity in arrangement, but on the ventral branchiaj all 

 are situated on the proximal ^ and on the dorsal on the proximal!half 

 of the stem, except that on the two dorsalmost they are evenTmore 

 extensively distributed. The ventral stems commonly bear 5 or 6'eyes, 

 occasionally as few as 3, usually distant or in couples. On the dorsal 

 half of the circle of branchise each shaft bears from 7 to 12, even the 

 latter number being exceeded on the dorsalmost pair. Except that 

 they are usually much crowded proximally, they are arranged similarly 

 to the ventral ones. 



As in P. brevihranchiata the collar is intermediate in form between 

 that of Eudisiyla and typical Pseudopotamilla. The dorsal lobes are 

 broadty rounded and slope caudally from their anterior median margin 

 into the dorso-lateral incision ; but they are so largely united with the 

 dorsal'surface of the thorax upon which they rest that only the outer 

 portion is free, though to a greater depth than in P. brevihranchiata . 

 The lateral portions rise abruptly as prominent lobes just dorsal to the 

 collar setae, and then continue of nearly even height until they rise 

 directly into the elongated narrow and pointed ventral lobes. 



Palpal and oral membranes of the usual form are present and the 

 tentacles have a length about equal to the breadth of the thorax, their 

 basal half being broad and foliaceous and the distal half slender and 

 cirriform. 



As a result of having been preserved in the tubes the body is slender, 

 elongated and nearly cylindrical throughout, only a very short region 

 at the posterior end being tapered to the pygidium, while the anterior 

 thoracic region is slightly depressed. Probably as a result of pressure 

 in the tubes, the segments are very faintly separated, except along the 

 glandular ventral plates. Except posteriorly they are rather long, the 

 anterior abdominal and the thoracic ones being from -} to h as long as 

 wide. The pygidium is oblique, with two pairs of minute lobes guard- 

 ing the anus laterally and sometimes a group of numerous small brown 

 specks on each side above. Normally there are 9 thoracic segments, 

 of which 8 are setigerous, though one example has but 7. The abdomi- 

 nal segments vary from 125 on a specimen 60 mm. long to 187 on the 

 largest example, measuring 148 mm. 



All of the ventral plates are narrow, nowhere exceeding ^ the body 

 width and usually much less than this. Corresponding to the form of 

 the segments the extreme posterior ones are 4 times as wide as long; 

 throughout most of the length of the abdomen they are tAvice as wide 

 as long; and those of the anterior abdominal and most of the thoracic 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 561 



segments are square, only the first 3 of the latter being again wider and 

 irregular. 



Except on the collar the thoracic seta tufts are oblique and linear, 

 nearly half as long as the corresponding tori, and each guarded by a 

 conspicuous anterior and posterior fold. Tori are relatively short, 

 little exceeding h the distance separating them ventrally, and of 

 remarkably uniform length, the second being slightly the longest and 

 those following decreasing in length to the last. On the abdomen the 

 uncinigerous tori and the setae tufts lie in nearly the same line, the latter 

 very slightly in advance of the former and but little shorter. 



The ffecal groove is well marked throughout both thorax and abdo- 

 men and passes obliquely across the right side of the first abdominal 

 and last thoracic segments for their entire length. 



Collar setffi are all of one form, capillary, acute, curved, narrowly 

 double-winged, not very long. The remaining thoracic fascicles are 

 composed of a small dorsal group of capillary setse similar to those just 

 described (fig. S) and a large number of broad-bladed spatulate setse 

 (fig. 10), forming a close phalanx of several vertical rows. Abdominal 

 setge are arranged in two vertical rows (about 15 in each on XX), the 

 one with short tips, the other with them more slender and about twice 

 as long (fig. 9). Koth have their shafts abruptly bent at the surface 

 of the body, where they are provided with short striated wings of 

 unequal width, beyond which projects the long, slender, acute tip. 



Thoracic tori contain the usual tAvo forms of avicular uncini and 

 pennoned seta, of which there are of each about 45 in each torus of V 

 and 30 on IX. On anterior segments the former have the form shown 

 in fig. 11, except that the beak is usually straighter. The body is long 

 and straight, the Ijreast moderate, the neck rather short, head large 

 and crest prominent and well forw^ard. On the last thoracic segment 

 the uncini (fig. 12) are very much larger and of quite different form, 

 the body being very long and slender, the breast very small, the neck 

 rather long and sloping forward, the head and crest small and the beak 

 less sharply bent downward. Anterior abdominal tori bear about 40 

 uncini (fig. 13) which are m\ich smaller than the smallest of the thoracic 

 and characterized by the small size of the posterior i)ortion of the 

 body, the large breast, and exceeding high and full crest. The pick- 

 shaped or pennoned seta (fig. 14) have short stems and slightly enlarged 

 heads with the usual hood and prolonged tip. 



Besides a slight tinge of brown about the parapodia, and, on some 

 specimens, 4 to 6 pairs of brown spots, diminishing in size posteriorly, 

 on the dorsum of II to V or ^TI, there is no pigment on the body. On 




562 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



the branchiae there is usiiall}- a narro\\' band of dull ])urplish-1:)rown on 

 the branchial bases and 3 zones of rich ]3\irplish-bro\vn on the basal 

 half of the branchiae, tlie lower two of which sometimes coalesce to 

 form a A^ery broad zone covering the entire occelated region. On the 

 alcoholic specimens this color very little involves the outer surface of 

 the stems, but is deep on their inner surfaces and the barbs. On one 

 specimen the barbs of the basal half of the branchine are also largeh^ 

 orange and the pigment of each eye extends as a narrow oblique line 

 in a proximal direction halfway across the outer surface of the stem. 



The tubes of this species occur, sometimes singly attached to stones, 

 sometimes in clumps of several wound among one another in an intri- 

 cate fashion and firmly united. They are thick, of cartilage-like con- 

 sistency after preservation and usually little encrusted with sand or 

 other foreign substances. In one case the attached surface of the tubes 

 is much infiltrated with calcareous matter. 



Specimens occur off Fort Rupert, Vancouver Island (station 4,202), 

 in 25-36 fathoms, on a bottom of gray sand ; in Icj' Strait (station 4.261), 

 in 10 fathoms, on a bottom of mud and rock; and at Afognak Island 

 (stations 4,269 and 4,270), in 14—19 fathoms, on a bottom of hard sand 

 with rocks. The last station yielded tlie largest specimens, among 

 them the type. 



Pseudopotamilla intermedia sp. nov. PL XXXVII, figs. 15 to 22. 



Of this well-marked species the type alone is known. This is a 

 female filled with eggs and having a total length of 58 mm., of which 

 the branchia3 are 3 mm. and the thorax 7 mm. The thorax is 2 mm. 

 and the anterior part of the abdomen 2.5 mm. wide. There are 158 

 somites, 10 (9 setigerous) of which are thoracic. 



Most noteworthy is the small size of the branchiae, the extreme length 

 of which is only 3 mm. The entire absence of pigment and the rela- 

 tively pale color of the eyes suggests the possibility of their being in 

 process of regeneration. The branchial ])ases are remarkal^ly small, 

 of soft texture, have the distal margin evenly transverse, the ventral 

 margin truncate and not at all elongated or spirally coiled, and the dor- 

 sal margin provided with a notched lappet as in P. brcvibrayichiaia, but 

 smaller and soft and meml^ranous instead of rigid. Each palpus bears 

 12 branchiae, including 2 or 3 rudimentary ventral ones. The longest 

 are only 3 times the height of the base, and only a little more than -J of 

 the length of the thorax. In arrangement they are strictly one-ranked, 

 and none is crowded into the interior. The stems are rather stout, 

 roimded on the external face and lack altogether marginal wings and 

 connecting membranes. The barl^s are two-ranked, distributed rather 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 563 



sparsely, the largest about 4 times the diameter of the stem, diminishing 

 in length toward the end, leaving a short thick tip of the stem naked. 

 Never more than 2 eyes, and sometimes one or none, occm- on each 

 stem. They are rather small, pale brown, regular in arrangement and 

 always on the proximal half and the dorso-median aspect of the stems 

 of the spread branchise. The oral membrane and tentacle are slightly 

 developed, the latter folded longitudinally. 



In most respects the collar is typical of the genus. The median 

 dorsal portion is better developed than in P. hrevibranchiata, but less 

 so than in P. oculijera (Leidy) ; the lateral portions are rather promi- 

 nent, rising abruptly from just above the collar seta^, and expanding 

 ventrally in broad, prominent lobes separated by the median ventral 

 fissure; on one side a deep notch, on the other a slight one bounds the 

 ventral lobe laterally. 



The form is generally slender and cylindrical, the thorax slightly 

 depressed anteriorly, narrower than the anterior region of the abdomen, 

 the posterior half of which tapers very gently to the pygidium, and the 

 anus nearly terminal but surmounted by a small lobe bearing two 

 groups of minute brown eye-spots. 



Thoracic setigerous tufts are prominent, the anterior especially 

 elongated and oblique. The uncinigerous tori are very little elevated 

 above the surface, the first and second longest, equalling about ^ the 

 circarnference of the body and separated by an equal ventral distance. 

 From the second they decrease in length, the last scarcely more than 

 ■J of the first and separated by a ventral distance of about ^ of the cir- 

 cumference. Abdominal parapodia are rather prominent, especially 

 the ventral setigerous ends, the first about equal to the eighth thoracic 

 and succeeding ones decreasing slowly but steadily to the last. 



The ventral glandular plates are narrow on the abdominal region, 

 separated from the parapodia by wide grooves and completely divided 

 into a pair of squares by the deep faecal groove, which turns to the right 

 obliquely across the first and appears again on the dorsum of the ante- 

 rior part of the thorax, where it opens into the dorsal fissure. It is not 

 visible on the posterior part of the thorax. The thoracic ventral plates 

 are indistinct and poorly developed in the type. 



No pigment is present on the greater part of the body, being confined 

 to 4 pairs of discrete reddish-brown spots on the dorsum of somites II 

 to V, which become successively smaller and the last mere specks. 

 Owing to the presence of great numbers of eggs the abdomen is some- 

 what yellowish. 



All setae have a pale yellow color. Those in the collar tuft are, 




564 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [July, 



like the succeeding thoracic tufts, of two kinds. A few of the 

 dorsahiiost are capillary, more or less sigmoidly curved and narrowly 

 winged. The ventral ones, more numerous and arranged in several 

 parallel rows, are of the mucronate-spatulate type, but have a 

 somewhat narrower and longer obovate blade than those on the fol- 

 lowing somites. On remaining thoracic somites the setre are more 

 numerous, the capillary (fig. 15) forming a projecting tuft, the spatulate 

 (fig. 17) in more and longer rows and having somewhat shorter and 

 broader blades than those on the collar; the mucronate tip is long and 

 slender. Abdominal setse are in two vertical rows, 9 or 10 in each row 

 of the first few fascicles and 4 or 5 in the less distinctly 2-ranked 

 fascicles of the caudal end. Both kinds have the shaft abruptly bent 

 just beyond the surface of the body, the longer form with a very 

 narrow accessory wing on the concave side and a wider but very 

 short wing on the convex side, and the smooth acute tip often 

 much longer than in the seta figured. The short setae (fig. 16) are sig- 

 moidly curved, have shorter, smooth tips and broader, strongly stri- 

 ated wings reflexed from the convex side. 



Thoracic tori bear avicular uncini in the posterior and pick-shaped 

 setae in the anterior row. The former (fig. 18) have long straight bodies, 

 moderate-sized breasts, rather short, erect necks, enlarged heads, 

 prominent 'crests very low in front, and curved beaks. On the last, 

 and possibly other posterior, thoracic somites the uncini (fig. 19) are 

 very much larger, with very long bodies, minute breast, long neck 

 well sloped forward, head not enlarged, very small crest and weak 

 beak. Another less typical one with somewhat larger crest is shown 

 in fig. 20; 43 occur in the 9th and 60 in the 4th torus, though the 

 latter occupy twice as long a space. The pick-shaped setae have 

 the form shown in fig. 22, the heads being much reduced and the 

 hoods much inflated and with slender tips about as long as the beaks 

 of the uncini. Abdominal aviculae (fig. 21) are much smaller than 

 the thoracic, with relatively shorter bases, larger breast, short thick 

 neck, and crest larger, farther forward and extending low down on the 

 beak, which has a straight profile.

 ures 65 mm. long, 27 mm. belonging to the branchiie and 8' mm. to the 

 thorax including the collar, -while the greatest T\idth of the thorax, 

 exclusive of the setae, is 5 mm.

The thoracic setigerous tubercles have short bases but project promi- 

 nently. The tori are very long, the first about twice and the last about 

 1^ times the ventral interspace, the others intermediate. On the abdo- 

 men the same parts are little elevated and placed at nearly the same 

 level as the dorsal end of tlie last thoracic. The setigerous line is 

 shorter than the thoracic and the first torus about j as long as the last 

 thoracic. About 90 avicula? and the same mmiber of pick-shaped setae 

 occur on the torus of III and 60 of each on IX. On the thoracic seg- 

 ments the spatulate setse are very numerous and arranged in 5 or 6 ver- 

 tical rows, wdiile the capillary setse do not exceed about 15. The capil- 

 lary abdominal seta are in two regular rows of about 10 each on the 

 anterior segments. 



All of the collar setae and the dorsalmost setae on the other thoracic 

 segments are rather short, stout, capillary, tapered to an acute tip, 

 little curved and with small, nearly symmetrical wings with very fine 

 oblique strise on each side. The spatulate setse (fig. 24) have stout 

 stems and rather long, narrow curved blades about 2^ times as long as 

 wide with apical arms of moderate length. The abdominal setse of 

 both rows do not differ greatly in length. They are longer than the 

 thoracic capillary setse, especially posteriorly, and are gracefully curved 

 and tapered, with fairly broad, oblique, strongly striated and nearly 

 symmetrical wings (fig. 23). Avicular uncini are nearly uniform in 

 size and form on all thoracic segments. They (fig. 25) have moder- 

 ately long ciu-ved bodies, full breasts, slender upright necks, elevated 

 crests and slender acute beaks. Abdominal avicular uncini (fig. 26) 

 are smaller and have very small bodies and deeper breasts but are other- 

 wise similar. The pick-shaped thoracic setae have the form shown in 

 fig. 27. 



Pigment is totally absent from the body and on the branchiae exists 

 only as six regular, narrow zones of pale reddish-brown, chiefly confined 

 to the basal halves of the barbs and scarcely apparent on the stems. 



The tubes are nearly straight, thick, pale brown and A^ery little 

 incrusted with sand or other foreign matter. 



Known only from t\A"o large specimens taken at station 4,245, 

 Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales Island, June 11, 1903, in 9o-9S fathoms, 

 on a bottom of dark green mud and sand mixed with shell and rock 

 fragments. 



Pseudopotamilla anoculata ep. nov. pi. XXXVII, figs. 28 to 33. 



This handsome species has the branchial bases exactly as in P. splen- 

 dida, that is, they are very small and concealed bj- the collar, somewhat 

 coalesced ventrally, and lack the dorsal la]5pet, ventral membrane and 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 567 



any indication whatever of a ventral involution. There are 15 pairs 

 of plume-like branchiae, each very long and graceful anfl without any 

 trace of an interbranchial membrane. The stems are more convex 

 externally than those of P. sylendida, but stDl distinctly flattened, and 

 there is no trace of eyes. The barbs are all very slender, 2-ranked, well 

 separated and increase regularly in size from very short ones at the 

 base to very long ones, much exceeding the diameter of the thorax 

 toward the end ; in the distal \ they again decrease, leaving a short tip 

 entirely free from them. 



The dorsal lobes of the collar are narrow and very long, considerably 

 exceeding the second segment in length, with nearly parallel sides and 

 rounded ends, the two separated by a ^^ide dorsal fissure. The dorso- 

 lateral notches are very deep but narrow and not occupied bj^ a small 

 lobe. Laterad of the notches the collar rises nearly to the height of the 

 dorsal lobes, which it somewhat overlaps by means of low, broad exten- 

 sions toward the median line. The remainder of the margin is even 

 and scarcely crenulate, the ventral lobes arising regularly and gradu- 

 ally, without the formation of any notch, into prominent triangular 

 lobes overlapping the bases of the branchiae and separated by a deep 

 median fissure. 



The single example is fortunately complete. It measures 122 mm. 

 long, the thorax being 15.5 mm. and the branchiae 32 mm. long, and the 

 former 3.5 mm. wide. It is consequently long and slender, tapering 

 to the pygidium in the posterior -^-. There are 14 (13 setigerous) tho- 

 racic somites and 162 abdominal somites. The former region is 

 scarcely depressed and the remainder of the body nearly cylindrical 

 from pressure of the tube. Besides being unusually broad and deep 

 anteriorly the dorsal fissure is prolonged into a faecal groove extending 

 for nearly the length of the thorax, but gradually fading out behind. 

 The thoracic segments are ^ as long as wide, the middle abdominal 

 about ^ as long as wide, and the posterior very much shorter. Ventral 

 plates are developed much as in P. splendida, but the thoracic are rela- 

 tively longer and the lateral notches divide them unequally, being 

 nearer to the posterior border; the anterior abdominal plates are twice 

 as wide as long and the posterior 4 times or more, all very thick and 

 deeply divided ; none of the al)dominals are notched laterally, and they 

 occupy about ^ of the body width. 



Thoracic setae tufts are short and straight, the anterior ones placed 

 at a very high level. The tori of III have a length of nearly ^ the cir- 

 cumference of the body and are separated by ^^entrally -J- this distance. 

 From the first they decrease in size regularly, the last and shortest 




568 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [J^ly, 



being but ^ as long as the first. The first abdominal torus is not more 

 than h as long as the last thoracic, and is on the level of the thoracic 

 setae tufts. The first thoracic torus bears 65 uncini and an equal num- 

 ber of pick-shaped setae, the fifth 43 and the last 33. Anterior abdomi- 

 nal tori have about 25 uncini and the setfe tufts about 15 setae, less dis- 

 tinctly in 2 rows than in other species. 



All of the collar setae and the dorsalmost setae of other thoracic fasci- 

 cles are of the usual slightly curved, acute, tapering form with short, 

 rather narrow, obliquel}^ striated wings which arise at an angle with 

 the stem. Not over about a dozen occur in each fascicle. Spatulate 

 setae (fig. 30) are much less numerous than in P. splendida, and arranged 

 in only 2 or 3 vertical rows. The wings are decidedly long, the entire 

 expanded region being 3 times as long as wide, with an apical arm 

 exceeding in length its greatest diameter. The striation of the blade 

 is unusually faint. Al^dominal setae (figs. 2S, 29) are few (about 15 

 in anterior tori) , not distinctly arranged in two rows, and the longer and 

 shorter ones not greatly different. The stem is constricted but not 

 sharply bent at the base of the blade. 



Avicular uncini (fig. 31) of similar form occur throughout the tho- 

 racic region. The base is only moderately elongated and slightly 

 curved, the breast rather prominent, the neck moderately long and 

 sloped forward, the crest well forward and forming a straight profile 

 with the slender acute beak. Abdominal uncini (fig. 32) are much 

 smaller, with very short bodies slightly curved downward posteriorly, 

 the breast deep and full, neck and crest similar to those of the thoracic 

 uncini, but the beak much shorter and smaller. The pick-shaped or 

 pennoned setae (fig. 33) have slightly curved stems, elongated flattened 

 heads, very difficult to see clearly, and high compressed hoods drawn 

 out at a wide angle with the stem into delicate pennants. 



No color remains except on the branchiae, the ventral ones of which 

 have 6 or 7 rich wine-color spots on the barbs and slightly on the stems. 

 On some of the dorsal branchiae these spots coalesce so that they are 

 chiefly colored, with a few irregular white spots at the base and a more 

 extensive white region toward the tip. 



The tube is dark colored, rough, brittle and covered with sand. 



This species is known from the type only, taken June 7, at station

NOTES ON SOME HAWAIIAN ACHATINELLID5: AND ENDODONTID^. 



BY H. A. PILSBRY AND E. G. VANATTA. 



In the course of identifying various snails received from Mr. D. 

 Thaanum some new species were encountered, and the necessity of 

 several rectifications in previous classifications became apparent. 



ACH ATINELLID^ . 

 In 1900, Mr. Sykes proposed the name Kauaia to replace the preoccu- 

 pied term Carinella Pfr., based upon Amastra kauaiensis. With some 

 doubt he included several umbilicated snails in the same group. In 

 om' view, the latter may better be segregated under another sectional 

 name. The groups will stand thus : 



Genus AMASTRA Ads. 

 (Forms with the whorls carinated.) 



Section Kauaia Sykes. 



Shell oblong-conic or biconic, carinated, solid, imperforate. Axis 

 tubular though small, obliquely contracted near the base in each whorl, 

 and in the last spirally plicate, making the columella obliquely trun- 

 cated at the base. Both species are from Kauai. 



A. kauaiensis Newc. A. knudseni Baldw. 



This group stands very close to the section Amastrella. 



Section Oyclamastra nov. 



Shell turbinate, with the spire conically elevated, carinated peripher- 

 ally, thin, umhilicated; the axis a rather large tube, widening toward the 

 base in each whorl, and in the last encircled with a callous spiral cord 

 extending upon the reflexed columellar lip. Type A. cyclostoma 

 Baldw. Kauai. 



The section Amastrella seems to us to be composite, comprising 

 members of several parallel series of Amastra. The species from Maui 

 and those from Oahu should be eliminated from the group, if this view 

 is correct. 



Section Helicamastra nov. 



Shell discoidal or biconvex, carinated, the diameter greatly exceeding 

 the height, spire flattened; thin; um])ilicated, the axis a large tube.

Lanai. Dr. W. Newcomb collection, Cornell University Museum. 



The specimens here described and figured are from Newcomb's 

 collection, and since Pfeiffer's types were from Newcomb, it maybe in- 

 ferred that they were from the same lot. In view of Dr. Pfeiffer's well- 

 known accuracy as a diagnostician, it is hard to believe that his descrip- 

 tion of Helix alata was based upon the same species, since it disagrees 

 in the number of whorls and shape of the spire, and in omitting a refer- 

 ence to the columellar lamella. It is possible that two species were 

 present in Newcomb's collection, and what Pfeiffer actually described 

 was a Pterodiscus close to P. ivesleyi. This could be decided by a 

 reference to Pfeiffer's own collection. Mr. Sykes, who had occasion to 

 correct the senior author's former identification of H. alaUi, did not 

 take the trouble to place the species upon a recognizable basis. 



Genus PTERODISCUS Pilsbry. 

 Manual of Conchology (Series 2), IX p. 36, November 16, 1803. 



Shell openly umbilicate, discoidal or subdiscoidal, thin, uniform 

 brown, and carinatc at the periphery. Peristome simple or expanded, 

 the columellar lip dilated. Axis and columella smooth, without a 

 spiral lamella. Jaw and radula as in Amastra. Type P. tceslcyi Sykes 

 { = Endodonla alata Pils., not Helix alata Pfr.?). This group was origi- 

 nally established as a section of Endodonta. Mr. Sykes elevated it^ to a 

 genus of the Endodontidcs . The examination of the jaw and radula of 

 P. digonophora shows it to belong to the Achatinellidce; and in that 

 group it stands close to Helicamastra, from which it is differentiated 

 solely l)y the total loss of the columellar lamella. In shape, texture, 

 sculpture and the structure of the early whorls, Pterodiscus and Helica- 

 mastra agree very closely. 



The jaw of P. digonophora is very thin, deeply arcuate, smooth except 

 for a few wide plaits or flat ribs in the median part. 



.XlV 



The radula of P. digonophora has 11, 7, 1, 7, 11 teeth. Those of the 

 median field stand in nearly straight transverse rows, but at the sides 

 the rows of marginal teeth bend rapidly forward. The centrals are 

 narrow, less than half the width of the adjacent lateral teeth, and bear 

 a single small cusp. The lateral teeth are square, bicuspid with a large 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 573 



mesocone and small ectocone as usual. The marginal teeth are short 

 and broad, with the mesocone oblique, and the ectocone split into two, 

 three or four minute, acute denticles. 



The known species are from Oahu. 



P. Wesley i Sykes. P. petasus Anc. 



P. digonophora Anc. 



Two other species were referred to this group by the senior author in 

 1893: Flelix prostrata Pse. and //. dcpressiformis Pse.,^ both described 

 from the ''Central Pacific Islands," and neither figured nor seen by 

 any subsequent author. Mr. Sykes did not find them in the British 

 Museum collection ; they arc not in the collections at Philadelphia or 

 Washington, nor is any trace of them to be found in the Pease collection 

 at Cambridge, Massachusetts.^ We learn from labels in the Academy 

 collection that Andrew Garrett knew them not. While there cannot 

 be much doubt that prostrata and depressiformis were based upon 

 species of Ptcrodiscus much like wesleyi and digonophora, it must be 

 admitted that the diagnoses are insufficient for positive identification; 

 and in the absence of types, the names must be regarded as defunct. 

 The three species known are quite distinct, being characterized as 

 follows : 



1. — Spire low-conic, with projecting, mucro-like apex; aperture small, 

 as high as wide, the peristome expanded, nearly continuous; 



umbilicus ample, P. petasus. 



2. — Spire flat or nearly so, the apex not raised. 



a. — XJmliilicus very large, broadly conic, the base strongly angular 



around it, P. digonophorus. 



h. — Umbilicus comparatively narrow, tubular, ... P. wesleyi.

Shell umbilicate, thin, flat above, convex beneath, carinated periph- 

 erally, brown with some irregular yellowish streaks, nearly lusterless. 

 Whorls 3^, the first perceptibly convex, the rest somewhat flattened, 

 sculptured with fine oblique growth-lines only. Last whorl carinated, 

 the keel bearing an irregular flange or 'Sving" of adhering earth; base

 is said to be H. alata Pfr., on Cuming's authority. 



' We are indebted to Dr. William H. Dall, of the National Museum, and Dr. 

 W. Faxon, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, for examining 

 the collections under their charge for these species.

convex, obtusely angular around the tubular umbilicus. Apertiu'e 

 oblique, much wider than high, the lip thin and simple, the cohnnellar 

 margin dilated. Alt. 3, diam. S mm. 



Kalaikoa, Oahu. Type No. 58,159, A. N. S. P., from Mr. D. D. 

 Baldwin. 



Quite vmlike the other known species in its larger aperture and 

 smaller umbilicus. It has not l)een descril)ed l)efore, Mr. Sykes's 

 name l)eing based solely upon the figure publisheil in the Manual of 

 CoiicJiolofpj. It seems rather an imecpial division of labor that we 

 should have to both figure and describe Mr. Sykes's species. 



This shell agrees well with PfeifTer's description of Helix alata; but 

 as the British Museum specimens under the name alata and those 

 in the Newcomb collection have the columella lamellate, it has been 

 held by INIr. Sykes that Pfeiffer overlooked the lamella. 

 Pterodiscus petasus Ancey. PI. XXXVIII, figs. 7, 8. 



Mr. Ancey 's figures were evidently drawn from a specimen not wholly 

 mature. Wlicn full-grown, the peristome is distinctly expanded, and 

 its margins approac-h nuich more than his figure shows. 



Waianae, Oahu. (D. I). Baldwin.) 



ENDODONTID^. 

 Endodonta (Nesophila) thaanumi n. sp. PI. XXXIX, figs, l, 2, 3. 



Shell discoidal, yellowish-white radially marked with tlark brown 

 lightning-shaped streaks. Spire composed of 5 rounded whorls, sep- 

 aratetl by a well-impressed suture. The first 4 whorls are about at the 

 same level, but the last 2 gradually descend to the aperture. The last 

 whorl is well rounded at the periphery and sculptured with 57 slightly 

 curved regularly spaced sharp ribs, the interstices of which are covered 

 with microscopical slraigJit vertical striic, about S or 10 l)etween two 

 larger ribs. The apex is smooth, but all the other whorls are costate. 

 The umbilicus is perspective, circular and about ^ the diameter of the 

 shell. The aperture is lunate, i^arietal callus thin, bluish-white, and 

 provided with two strong spirally entering lamella;. Palatal teeth or 

 plicae are absent. 



Alt. 2, diam. 5 mm. 



Kaiwiki, near Hilo, Hawaii. 



The types are in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, 

 No. 89,245. They were collected by Mr. D. Thaaniim, in whose honor 

 the species is named. 



Specimens of E. hystrix (" Migh. " Pfr.) received by the Academy from 

 Dr. A. Gould have the vertical striic undulating, which at once dis- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 575 



tingiiishes them from E. thaanumi; otherwise they are very similar. 

 E. paucicostata (Pse.) is smaller and of a different shape. 



Melanistic and albino specimens occur with the types at Kaiwiki. 

 Mr. Thaanum has collected this species also at Olaa, Hawaii, and Hono- 

 kowai Gulch, West Maui. Under a lens in a good light some faint 

 scratches may be seen in some places, but they do not amount to spiral 

 lines. 

 Endodonta (Thaumatodon) luctifera n. sp. PI. XXXIX, figs. 4, 5, 6. 



Shell discoidal, light yellow marked wdth brown flames, whorls 5^, 

 suture moderate, s])ire rather flat, the entire last whorl a little descend- 

 ing. Apex smooth, the rest of the shell evenly costate. There are 

 about 59 costse on the last whorl with about 10 to 12 vertical intersti- 

 tial striae, but no spiral lines. The periphery is well rounded, umbilicus 

 perspective and about ^ the diameter of the shell. Ajierture lunate, 

 with 2 strong spirally entering parietal lamellae and a very short basal 

 plica or tooth. A smaller specimen has another very weak palatal 

 plica at the periphery. 



Alt. 2h, diam. 6 mm. 



vSandwich Islands. Types are in the collection of the Academy of

This species differs from E. elisa; Ancey in having two parietal 

 lamellae, and it has fewer palatal folds than E. hystricella pmtcilamellata 

 Ancey.

CRAT.EGUS IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. 

 BY C. S. SARGENT. 



This preliminary sketch of the genus Cratcegus in eastern Pennsyl- 

 vania is based chiefly on the large collections and copious field notes 

 made during the last five years by Mr. Benjamin H. Smith, of Philadel- 

 phia, in Delaware, Philadelphia and Chester counties, by Dr. C. D. 

 Fretz, of Sellersville, in Bucks county principally in the neighborhood 

 of Sellersville and at Durham, and by Mr. C. L. Gruber in Berks 

 county, largely near Kutztown, and in North Heidelberg township. 

 Their careful observations and assistance have made this publication 

 possible. A few specimens collected by the late Prof. Porter in Easton, 

 Northampton county, and by Mr. A. MacElwee, of the Philadelphia 

 Museums, are also included. Previous to his death in 1904, Mr. W. M. 

 Canby, of Wilmington, Delaware, had become interested in the thorns 

 of eastern Pennsylvania, and together we had collected considerable 

 material in Bucks, Delaware and Monroe counties during several jour- 

 neys that we made for the purpose of studying the genus in this inter- 

 esting region. 



This paper is published at this time with no idea that it is exhaustive 

 or final, but to show the richness of eastern Pennsylvania in forms of 

 this genus, and with the hope that this unexpected revelation will lead 

 other botanists living in that part of the State to carry on the work of 

 investigation so ably begun by their associates. 



The following arrangement of the natural groups in which the species 

 of eastern Pennsylvania may be arranged will perhaps prove helpful in 

 the study of the group.

Crakegus trahax (Gruber, No. 45) appears to differ from common 

 forms of Cratcegus crus-galli only in its usually unarmed branchlets and 

 small fruit. Gruber's No. 105 is, perhaps, the same.

becoming glabrous. Fruit oblong, often 2-5 centimeters in length, 

 rather brighter-colored than those of the type; nutlets usually 1 or

Readily distinguished by the hairs on the upper side of the midribs 

 of the young leaves, and by the larger oblong fruits usually with a single 

 nutlet. Further investigation of this form may show that it should be 

 considered a^species. 



Crataegus crus-galli var. capellata Sargent. 



Bot. Gazette, XXXV, 100 (The Genus Crataegus in New Castle County, Dela-

 length. 



Philadelphia county: Meadow at the head of the Wissahickon Drive, 

 Germantown, W. M. Canhij, May 24, 1902. 



What appears an unusual form of Cratcegus crus-galli hsis been found 

 by Mr. Smith below Gray's Ferry in West Philadelphia (No. 248). It 

 is a tree about 5 m. high, nearly destitute of thorns, with wide-spreading 

 branches forming a round-topped head, oblong-obovate leaves acute, 

 acuminate or rarely rounded at the apex, their veins more prominent 

 than those of the leaves of ordinary forms of Cratcegus crus-galli. 

 Flowers 8-10 mm. in diameter in many-flowered glabrous corymbs; 

 stamens 6-10; anthers pink; styles 1 or 2. The fruit I have not seen. 

 The absence of thorns is remarkable in plants of this group. 

 2. Crataegus rivalis n. sp. 



Leaves obovate to oval, acute at the apex, gradually narrowed and 

 concave-cuneate at the base, and sharply usually simply serrate above 

 the middle, with glandular teeth; nearly fully grown when the flowers 

 open from the 20th to the 25th of May, and then villose, with long pale 

 hairs on the upper side of the midril^s and of the petioles, and at matiu*- 

 ity glabrous, dark green and very lustrous on the upper and dull and 

 paler on the lower surface, 4-5 centimeters long, 2-2.5 centimeters 

 wide, with prominent yellow midribs and slender conspicuous veins 

 without the parenchyma; their petioles slender, grooved, more or less

wing-margined toward the apex, becoming glabrous, occasionallyjfiir- 

 nished with minute glands; on vigorous shoots leaves oval, acute or 

 abruptly acuminate, coarsely doubly serrate often nearly to the base, 

 sometimes laterally divided into short acute lobes, 8-10 cm. long and 

 5-6 cm. wide, with stout petioles wing-margined nearly to the base, and 

 foliaceous lunate coarsely serrate stalked petioles 1-1.5 cm. in length. 

 Floivers 1.3-1.5 cm. in diameter, on slender pedicels, in compact glabrous 

 corymbs, with caducous glandular bracts and bractlets; calyx-tube 

 narrowly obconic, the lobes linear, acuminate, entire or occasionally 

 glandular-serrate, sparingly villose on the inner surface below the mid- 

 dle; stamens 15; anthers rose color; styles 2 or 3, surrounded at the 

 base by tufts of pale hairs. Fruit ripening toward the end of Septem- 

 ber in few-fruited drooping clusters, short-oblong, full and rounded at 

 the ends, dull red covered with a glaucous bloom, 1-1.2 cm. long; calyx- 

 cavity narrow, the lobes little enlarged, reflexed and closely appressed, 

 villose above, often deciduous from the ripe fruit; nutlets narrowed at 

 the apex, rounded at the base, very prominently ridged on the back, with 

 a broad high grooved ridge, 8-10 mm. long and 5-6 mm. wide. 



A bushy tree, with a short stout stem occasionally 30 cm. in 

 diameter, covered with light red-brown scaly bark, stout ascending 

 ashy-gray branches forming a broad open head, and stout branchlets 

 glabrous, dull green and marked by numerous pale lenticels when they 

 first appear, light orange or reddish-brown and very lustrous in their 

 first winter, dull orange or dull gray-brown in their second year, and 

 armed wath numerous stout straight or slightly curved dark reddish- 

 brown ultimately ashy-gray spines 2-3 cm. in length.

Well distinguished from Cratcegus crus-galli Linnaeus, by the shape of 

 the acute leaves, their prominent veins, the hairs on the upper surface 

 of the midribs, and especially by the shape of the large leaves of vigor- 

 ous shoots, by the larger number of stamens and the earlier ripening of 

 the fruit.

of Cratcegus jcctida (No. 14) is described by Mr. Gruber as ''dull mottled 

 red-scarlet or bronze, ground color apparently a dark red-scarlet or 

 orange-red usually much blotched with dark olive-green, often blotched, 

 tinged or shaded with olive, light olive-green or dark red, sometimes 

 with reddish-orange, rose or russet, punctate with greenish-orange or 

 russet." In No. 68, which is evidently the same species, the fruit is 

 described by him as "red-bronze to orange-bronze or light reddish- 

 bronze, and not so much mottled or blotched, often very little blotched 

 or not at all." Except in these slight variations in the color of the 

 fruit I can find no differences between Cratcegus haxteri and Cratcegus 

 fcetida, which is thus widely distributed from western Massachusetts 

 to western New York and eastern Pennsylvania.

This species, which is still imperfectly known, resembles in general 

 appearance Cratcegus peckii Sarg. of the Hudson River Valley, but 

 differs from that species in the absence of hairs on the lower side of the 

 shorter and comparatively broader leaves, by the more slender entirely 

 glabrous pedicels, and in the smaller number of stamens.

THE SPHAGNUM FROG OF NEW JERSEY-RANA VIRGATIPES Cope. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



On April 23, 1905, Mr. Thomas D. Keim and the writer, while 

 investigating the fauna of the Great Egg Harbor river, obtained a num- 

 ber of specimens of the interesting frog Rana virgatipes Cope, and were 

 fortunate enough to learn something of its habits. The species seems 

 to have been obtained on but two other occasions since it was first 

 found by Cope in October of 1891.^ Mr. Witmer Stone secured one on 

 Shoal Branch of Wading river, near Speedwell, N. J., June 20, 1901, 

 and on May 31, 1905, Mr. Paul Lorrilliere obtained one on a branch of 

 the Batsto river near White Horse, N. J. All the above specimens, as 

 well as Cope's types, are now in the collection of the Academy, making 

 a series of thirty- two examples. 



Our specimens were obtained at the mouth of Mare Run, the type 

 locality, and we noticed no other batrachia in the vicinity. The 

 frogs seemed to occur exclusively in the almost submerged masses of 

 sphagnum which line the shores in many places, and often extend well 

 out in the stream. Here the water is still and the animals rest more or 

 less below, so that their dull colors harmonize well with the surround- 

 ings. They were shy and sank cpiickly out of sight among the aquatic 

 vegetation on the approach of danger. In attempting to escape they 

 would not jump or leap, and when caught in the dip-net moved about 

 in a rather slow stupefied manner. They swam for short distances, 

 but were usually able to find suitable shelter close at hand. 



The individuals obtained by Cope and Stone did not make any noise, 

 but when we discovered ours the males were in full cry, which would 

 seem to indicate that late April w^as the height of the nuptial season. 

 The males are provided with distensible vocal vesicles, and when about 

 to utter their call these sacs are inflated like little bladders till nearly 

 spherical, and then by degrees the air is allowed to escape. This gives 

 the sac the appearance of collapsing by a series of jerks. As it is done 

 quickly, each jerk at an interval of a second, the result is a sort of rap- 

 ping sound. These raps, or jerks, are about five or six in number. 

 The sound produced is peculiar in that it is difficult at times to detect 



» Amer. Naturalist, XXV, 1891, p. 1,017. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 663 



its source, and if the frog is close is quite startling. This is clue not 

 only to the suddenness, but also to the volume of sound. On one 

 occasion an example which I captured had his vocal vesicles well in- 

 flated, and though they partly collapsed as I held him in my hand he 

 did not utter any sound. The call bears considerable resemblance to 

 the noise produced by woodchoppers cutting trees a short distance 

 back in the forest, and is different from the cry of any other batrachian, 

 so that when first heard I suspected it was produced by this species. 



In life the general color of the body is muddy-brown above. The 

 lower surface is whitish, with a very diluted tint of dull yellowish in 

 some examples. This was especially noticeable on the lower surface 

 of the head and the forefeet. Side of head l:)rownish . A pale brownish 

 line from behind each eye back toward hind leg, distinct at first, but 

 fading out gradually behind. Edge of upper jaw of same color, though 

 with bronzed reflections in some examples. This color is then contin- 

 ued back as a line from below tympanum to groin. Along the flank it 

 is a little paler and sometimes a little broader than the streak above. 

 It serves to separate similar tinted or blackish-brown blotches of the 

 lower surface from the color of the back. Back variegated with ob- 

 scure blackish blotches nearly as large as pupil, and the same on the 

 upper surface of the legs. Lower surface of legs with blackish- 

 brown variegations, which also extend on the belly, and flanks below, 

 though they vary greatly. Feet dusky, membranes of hind toes with 

 blackish blotches. Tympanum and iris beautiful l^ronzed brown, a 

 narrow ring of bronze encircling pupil. 



Considerable variation as to color is observed in the large series of 

 examples before me. This is striking in the color markings of the 

 lower surface and is to be found in both sexes. Some examples have 

 the dusting of the throat more intense or dark, some nearly white, and 

 in others it is variegated with diffuse blotches of blackish-brown like 

 those on breast. The same is true of the markings of the other lower 

 regions, though they do not have the dusted appearance. In the case 

 of two large females the markings on the under surface of the hind legs 

 are very pale. Though there is a great variation in the extent of the 

 dark coloring of the lower surface the general character of the markings 

 is always retained. No two individuals are alike and the hind legs 

 sometimes differ from one another. Two of Cope's examples are a little 

 smaller than any of mine, though both are more or less mottled or 

 blotched on the belly. As this seems to be the case with all of my 

 smaller or medium-sized examples I suspect it to be a character associ- 

 ated with youth. The style of the coloration of the upper parts is less 




664 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



variable. In some living examples I noticed here and there one a 

 trifle pale, or with paler streaks, or the upper jaw more bronzed. The 

 lower lateral streak from below the tympanum appears to var}^ also, 

 as it is either ochraceous, dull reddish, brownish, olivaceous or whitish. 

 Some variation may also be noticed in the skin. Some have the dermal 

 papillae rather more scattered than others. These are usually the 

 smaller individuals, as the larger ones have a somewhat warty appear- 

 ance.

DELAWARE VALLEY FORMS OF TRACHELOMONAS. 



BY T. CHALKLEY PALMER. 



The uniflagellate protozoa belonging to the genus Trachelomonas 

 are normally provided with intensely green chromatophores, a red 

 pigment-spot, a contractile vacuole and a hard, brittle, brownish lorica. 

 The lorica has a single aperture wherethrough issues the very long 

 flagellum. With the aid of this flagellum the monad swims rapidly in 

 an irregularly spiral course. Though habitually inhabiting the lorica, 

 the monad is able to squeeze through the very small aperture and to 

 swim naked; and almost any rich gathering of Trachelomonas will 

 show numerous individuals in this condition, wherein they are scarcely 

 to be distinguished, except by minute study, from species of the nor- 

 mally naked genus Euglena. Different species of Trachelomonas, 

 when without their loricae, are not at all recognizable. Specific dis- 

 tinctions, in short, are founded of necessity, in thi,s genus, on lorica 

 characters. 



These loricae, when heated nearly to redness on a cover-glass, still 

 keep their shapes, and show only a certain loss of transparency and a 

 considerable reddening of the originally brown color. The ability to 

 withstand a high degree of heat was taken by early students of the 

 genus as an indication of their silicious constitution. When, however, 

 these loricae are treated with acids, the hardness, brittleness and color 

 gradually disappear, and soon nothing remains but a thin, gelatinous 

 pellicle, which in turn is capable of gradual and complete solution in 

 hot nitric acid or in sulphuric acid and bichromate of potash. The 

 mineral matter they contain is, therefore, something other than silica; 

 and Klebs,^ among others, has stated that this mineral matter is, in 

 some cases at least, ferric hydroxide. The test to determine this point 

 is sufficiently simple. It is only necessary to burn the loricae 'on a 

 cover-glass, and to invert over a drop of a solution of potassium ferro- 

 cyanide containing a small addition of hydrochloric acid. In a very 

 few minutes the acid begins to dissolve the oxide of iron, and simul- 

 taneously ferric ferrocyanide deposits as a blue cloud around each of 

 the loricae. The writer has put to this test most of the loricae pertaining 



' Klebs, Untersuch. Tubing. Inst., I, 1883. 




666 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



to the Delaware Valley species, and in every case the result was as 

 described.^ During this investigation numerous lorica^ were also 

 dried upon the cover-glass without burning, and examined for carbon 

 dioxide with hydrochloric acid. The result was negative in every 

 case. The lorica of T. piscatoris was included in these tests. The 

 supposition of Fisher,^ that these loricae are to a considerable extent 

 composed of calcium carbonate, is therefore still without confirmation. 

 The effervescence observed by Fisher, and attributed by him to carbon 

 dioxide, ma)^ be capable of another explanation. 



Reduplication in the genus Trachelomonas is usually, if not always, 

 accomplished within the lorica, and the act is followed normally by 

 the withdrawal of one of the newly formed monads through the minute 

 aperture. This operation has been observed frequently by students, 

 so that its apparent impossibility goes for nothing. The naked indi- 

 viduals already referred to are largely the product of this process. 

 Subsequently, but after how great an interval of time is uncertain, the 

 euglenoid form is lost, the body assumes the spherical or ovoid shape 

 proper to the species, and a new shell is secreted. Tliis process the 

 writer has seen in part. The individual was of the species T. hispida. 

 The shell was already outlined as a very tenuous layer of nearly invisi- 

 ble gelatin, to the* outside of which clung a dim halo of inert minutse. 

 But this soft and adherent condition was only transitory. The animal, 

 revolving tirelessly within the nascent, stationary shell, continued 

 without ceasing to brush and pat and feel all over the surface with its 

 wonderful flagellum. By degrees the debris was mostly dislodged. 

 Within two hours the lorica was beginning to take on a slight tint; it 

 had attained to a consistency, though the spines characteristic of the 

 mature shell were still almost invisible. Very suddenly the lorica itself 

 began to revolve with the revolving monad, and in a moment monad 

 and lorica were gone. 



It sometimes happens that after subdivision the withdrawal of one 

 of the monads does not at once follow. Loricae are to be seen, now and 

 again, with two monads, much pressed for room, and with flagellse mu- 

 tually interfering and working at cross-purposes. The course of the 



' These loricae are, therefore, altogether different from the silicious shells de- 

 scribed by the present writer in these Proceedings, 1902, and there placed tenta- 

 tively in the genus Trachelomonas. Some of those described and figured, and 

 a few among the large number of similar ones observed, were afterwards seen 

 in living but quiescent condition, and the indications are that they represent the 

 resting or encysted state of various Protozoa, some of which at least belong to the 

 Chromomonadina. It was, therefore, a complete error to refer them to the genu 

 Trachelomonas.

1905.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 667 



combination through the water is then erratic beyond what is usual. 

 Loricae occur, also, with duplicate apertures, though whether such are 

 due to a similar state of affairs, only more prolonged, may be matter of 

 doubt. Sporulation, or the splitting up of the whole monad into a 

 multitude of very small, monoflagellate spores, which has been observed 

 in this as well as in other genera of the Protozoa, is evidently a less 

 frequent phenomenon. The evidence of it, however, is often seen in 

 the numerous very small loricae of many shapes. These small loricae 

 cannot with any certainty be referred to species, since in them the 

 sjiecific features are to a large extent undeveloped. The different steps 

 of the process that results at last in a fully developed monad, starting 

 from these spores, would seem not to have been followed by students. 

 It is evident, however, that the steps are few; since while very small 

 loricae are common, medium-sized ones are comparatively rare. 

 Authors have endeavored, and generally with success, to confine their 

 descriptions in this genus to mature forms. The specific characters 

 being almost without exception founded on the shape, size and surface 

 markings of the loricae, it is at once evident that for specific diagnosis 

 these loricae should be fully formed. It would seem, however, that in a 

 few cases this principle has not been in operation to the fullest extent 

 possible, and a few species are in consequence not quite adequately 

 ciiaracterized. In the descriptive part that follows, only the loricae 

 that are mature, as manifested by their full development in point of 

 color, size and markings, are accepted as typical. 



All the species of Trachelomonas known to the writer are found in 

 fresh water. Roadside pools, ditches, ponds, all yield them in larger 

 or smaller numbers. They congregate in particular around rusty 

 patches where ferrous compounds oozing out of the soil are in process 

 of oxidation and precipitation. They often abomid, however, in still 

 waters covered with Lemna, and in those filled with Utricidaria, Pota- 

 mogeton and other aquatics. 



Klebs has described^ two forms of Trachelomonas that are devoid 

 of chlorophyll, one of which he has named T. reticulata and the other 

 7\ volvocina var. hyalina. Both occur in decaying organic solutions, 

 and are no doubt of saprophytic habit. Neither of these appears to 

 have been noted in the territory covered by this paper. 



In the table of species all the well-known forms are given whether 

 known in Delaware Valley or not. A single form, not considered of 

 specific value, is distinguished by an asterisk.

Trachelomonas volvocina Ehr. 



Trachelomonas volvocina Ehrenberg. 1833. Abh. Berlin. Akad. 



Lorica spheroidal, brown, surface nearly smooth. Aperture plane 

 or produced into a cylindrical tube, which may be normal to the surface 

 or slightly oblique. 



This is perhaps the most common of local species, and very variable. 

 The lorica may be prolately — or oblately — spheroidal, and of any size 

 from very minute to 29 // in diameter. The oblately spheroidal forms 

 seldom exhibit any tube-like prolongation, but often a wide saucer- 

 shaped depression surrounds the aperture and the wall is at that point 

 very heavy. The tube, when present, may be altogether without the 

 lorica, or partly within it and attached to the apex of a funnel-shaped 

 depression in the wall. The surface of the finished lorica is almost 

 smooth, or at most slightly wavy, though the intimate granular nature 

 of the wall may at times be made out.

Traohelomonas verrucosa Stokes. PI. XLI, fig. 2. 



Trachelomonas verrucosa Stokes. 1887. Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc, XXI"\'. 



"Lorica subspherical, colorless, the entire surface covered with 

 minute hemispherical elevations, the anterior extremity slightly 

 emarginate." 



This species is not uncommon in the Delaware Valley, and it is 

 especially plentiful at times in tidal ditches. As observed, it agrees 

 closely with the description as quoted from Dr. Stokes, except only 

 that the lorica is very generally brown instead of colorless. The hemi- 

 spherical elevations sometimes show a slight tendency to elongate. 

 Observed maximum diameter 24 /i. 

 Traohelomonas rugulosa Stein. PI. XLI, figs. 7 and 8. 



Trachelomonas rvgulosa Stein. 1878. Infusionsthiere, III. 



Lorica subspherical, thick-walled, brown. Surface with short, 

 irregular, transverse to oblique, crooked wrinkles. Aperture plane, 

 generally surrounded by a flat, smooth area. 



Observed maximum diameter 23 /j.. 



It is a present tendency to reduce this form to a variety of T. volvo- 

 cina. Immature individuals of the spheroidal species show resem- 

 blances that are more or less puzzling. No doubt these species are 

 closely related and of recent differentiation. But the well-developed, 

 highly colored, mature loricse seem to differ with a sufficient constancy. 



Published figures of the present species, mostly copied from Stein, 

 are naturally quite as nebulous and unsatisfactory as Stein's own. 

 Since it is proposed to insist herein upon the apparent validity of this 

 species, the mature lorica, as it occurs along the Delaware, is illustrated 

 in PL XLI, figs. 7 and 8, with such fidelity as was attainable. The 

 markings vary in development from faint, elongated dots to crooked, 

 confluent ridges. These ridges are by no means uniformly arranged 

 spirally in the manner indicated in Stein's figm-es; and the internal 

 spiral vestiges, shown in one of these figures, can scarcely constitute 

 a specific character, since the like may often be seen, under favorable 

 conditions, in almost any species of the genus. 



The form figured was collected in numbers in Tinicum, August, 1903. 

 Others quite similar were observed at Penn Valley, September, r904. 

 The same species, collected at Hammonton, New Jersey, in 1902, 

 showed confluent rugosities that could only be described as cerebroid 

 convolutions. In none of these was observable any tendency toward 

 production of the aperture into a tube like that of T. volvocina. In 

 every way T. rugulosa seems much more closely related to T. verrucosa 

 than to T. volvocina. Certain plainly immature conditions resemble 




670 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



figures of T. rugulosa hitherto pubhshed, but no valid conchisions as 

 to specific relationships are to be drawn from such. 

 Traclielomonas Stokesiana sp. nov. PI. XLI, figs. 4 and 5. 



Lorica spheroidal, thin-walled, one-tenth longer than broad, at 

 maturity dark brown. Surface with conspicuous, mostly distinct, 

 occasionally anastomosing, continuous ridges, obliquely longitudinal 

 on the sides, strongly spiral at the ends. Aperture a round, bluntly 

 conical, short tube, seated in a shallow circular depression. Monad 

 green, with red pigment-spot. Flagellum long. 



Observed maximum length of lorica IS//. Ponds, Penn Valley, 

 Bucks county, Pennsylvania. 



This species differs from T. rugulosa in the thinner vsall of the mature 

 lorica, in its smaller size, in its shape, and in the character and disposi- 

 tion of the markings. It differs from T. torta in size, shape, aperture 

 and markings. 



It was collected in large numbers at Penn Valle}' during the summer 

 and autumn of 1904. With it were smaller numbers of T. armata, 

 volvocina and hispida. I>ater it was found, but sparsely, in Tinicum, 

 where, however, the remarkable constancy of its characters was again in 

 evidence. The monad moves rapidly in an irregular spiral. I\Iany 

 individuals were observed in the naked condition, and the pigment- 

 spot was then seen without difficulty. 



I am glad of the permission to name this species in honor of Dr. A. C. 

 Stokes, of Trenton, New Jersey, whose w^ork in this and other genera 

 of the Protozoa is known to all students. 



Traohelomonas cylindrica Ehr. 



Trachelomonns cylindrica Ehrenberg. 1S33. Abb. Berlhi. Akad. 



Lorica reddish-brown, narrowly cylindrical, ends slightly flattened, 

 smooth. Aperture plane or produced into a short, straight or oblique 

 tube with smooth limb. Length 25 n. 



Only a few specimens of this have been seen by the writer, all of them 

 coming from Tinicum. They accompanied the following species, 

 which they resembled in a general way, really differing therefrom in 

 loricate characters only in being very much narrower, and mostly of a 

 deeper color. 



Traohelomonas euchlora (Ehr.) comb. nov.

Lorica light-brown, elliptical or somewhat C|uadrate, surface smooth. 

 Aperture generally produced into a short oblique tube. Length about 

 33 fj-. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 671 



This is not more plentiful than T. cylindrica locally, and has not been 

 found by the writer in numbers sufficient for proper study. There is 

 room for doubt whether this is the organism described and figured by 

 Ehrenberg. Neither the lorica as observed nor Stein's figure resem- 

 bles Ehrenberg's figure xxiv, Taf. II, Infusionsthieren. Assuming, 

 however, for the present, an identity, T. lagenella Stein becomes T. 

 uchlora in accordance with known rules. 



Traohelomonas uroeolata Stokes. 



Trachelomonas urceolata Stokes. 1887. Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc. 



"Lorica vasiform, smooth, about twice as long as broad, the lateral 

 margins slightly flattened, produced anteriorly in a short, subcylin- 

 drical neck, the borders somewhat everted, truncate, not obhque; 

 posterior extremity not inflated, produced in an acuminate, tail-like 

 prolongation; endoplasm enclosing numerous, probably amylaceous, 

 corpuscles." 



Dr. Stokes gives the length of lorica in this remarkable species at 

 the equivalent of about 44/^, and the "habitat, pond-water." It has 

 been observed by the writer in some abundance in living condition in a 

 gathering from Riverton, New Jersey. It was accompanied by T. 

 volvocina, arniata and piscatoris. It differs remarkably from 

 familiar species of the genus in the proportionately wide aperture, and 

 in the thin, easily distorted, parchment-like lorica. The surface of the 

 lorica in these specimens was not smooth, but profusely tuberculate, 

 and the caudal process showed in some cases two or three appressed 

 setse. The material containing this form was made available through 

 the kindness of Mr. Edward Potts. 



Traohelomonas eurystoma Stein. 



Tradielomona^ eurystoma Stein. 1S7S. Infusion.sthiere, III. 



Lorica brown, broadly ovoid, obtusely pointed posteriorly, surface 

 entirely smooth. Aperture surrounded by a short, wide rim with 

 crenulated edge. Length 30 //.. 



Apparently rare in Delaware Valley. It has been observed, in num- 

 bers too small for proper study, in gatherings made in Tinicum. The 

 crenulation of the wide, shallow rim around the aperture is not always 

 evident. 



Trachelomonas torta Keilicott. 



Trachelomonas torta Keilicott. 1885. Proc. Amer. Soc. Micros. 

 "Egg-shaped colorless, ornamented by oblique rugosities, giving 

 the appearance of having been twisted; aperture situated in a short 

 oblique groove ; flagellum very long ; animalcule green, with red eye- 

 spot." 




672 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept.. 



Length of lorica, the equivalent of 50 il 



This is one of the largest of the genus, and one of the rarest in Dela- 

 ware Valley. The writer has seen at most three specimens, and in one 

 of these the lorica was colored a deep brown.

Lorica ellipsoidal, brown, the general surface deasely and finely 

 punctate. Two irregular rows of short, conical spines around apertm'c. 

 Often a ring of six to twelve or more long, hollow, curving spines 

 around posterior end. Aperture in a shallow, wide, rimmed depression, 

 and infrequently produced into a short tube with stellate limb. Length 

 of lorica 39 ;j-. 



This species is common in Delaware Valley and it exhibits much 

 variety of form. But among the thoasands of specimens examined, 

 not one has shown a lorica with the smooth surface attributed to the 

 species by authors. Dr. A. C. Stokes has accurately described his 

 form acanthostoma as having a punctate surface. This would unques- 

 tionably be a specific distinction were it not true that all forms of T. 

 armata, as found in this region, have precisely the same punctation. 



The posterior ring of large, curving spines seems to be a very lato 

 excrescence in the individual development, and these spines may be 

 seen in all stages of sprouting.

Trachelomonas crebea Kellicott. 1887. Proc. Amer. Soc. Micros. 



" Lorica spheroidal, varying from decided brown to colorless, ellipti-

 with minute raised points over entire surface. Anterior projection 

 hyaline, minutely notched and slightly everted at outer extremit}'. 

 |- length of shell." 



The length of lorica is given by Kellicott at the equivalent of 25 p. . 

 This species, as it occurs along the Delaware, where it is not uncommon, 

 presents some variations. A prevalent form, figured herewith, is 

 indefinitely and coarsely punctate, the puncta? being of various sizes 




1905.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 673 



and shapes. The aperture is produced into a curving tube, coarsely 

 toothed and not everted at the extremity. It reaches a length of 30 ,u. 

 A cvirious circumstance is that individuals of this description habitu- 

 ally swim in a reverse direction, that is to say, with aperture in the 

 rear. 



Forms with straight aperture-tubes are not wanting, but they are 

 not common in the territory.

Lorica brown, ovoid to long-elliptical, ends equally rounded. Sur- 

 face mostly densely hispid throughout, occasionally nearly smooth. 

 Aperture plane or produced into a short, cylindrical, hyaline tube. 



A common and variable species, presenting all its well-known shapes 

 in the Delaware Valley. A very small, tail-like, hyaline projection is 

 sometimes present on the posterior end. The maximum size attributed 

 to the species by Saville Kent is about the equivalent of 40 ij.. but it is 

 usually much smaller, and mostly about 30 /i. An occasional specimen 

 has measured as high as 42 il 



Trachelomonas caudata (Ehr.) Stein. 



Choetoglena caudata Ehrenberg. 1840. Monatsberichte der Berliner Aizad. 

 Trachelomonas caudata Stein. 1878. Infusionsthiere, III. 



Lorica brown, elongate-ovoid, acuminate posteriorly and produced 

 into a conspicuous, hyaline, tail-like process. Surface densely hispid. 

 Aperture in a long, hyaline, trumpet-form tube with everted and 

 deeply dentate limb. 



A rare species, but occurring in typical form in Tinicum. It is said 

 to reach a length of 52 m. The local specimens measured at most 40 ,«. 

 The spiny ornamentation is precisely like that of T. hispida, but there 

 is never any trouble in distinguishing the two. This species is figured 

 by Perty {Zur Kentniss Kleinster Lebensformen, 1852, Tab. X, fig. 14) 

 under the name of Chonemonas acuminata. 



Trachelomonas obtusa sp. nov. PI. XLI, fig. 3. 



Lorica brown, with straight sides, rounded in front, abruptly conical 

 posteriorly. Surface clothed with short, slender spines. Aperture not 

 produced, bordered by a smooth area. Monad green with red pigment- 

 spot. Flagellum long. 



Lorica 33 p- long, 16 ij. broad. Fresh-water ditches and ponds. 



This species is not rare, but it has not yet been found in any large 

 numbers in a single gathering. It occurs in tidal ditches in Tinicum, 

 44 




674 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



and in ponds among aquatic plants at Riverton. New Jersey. It pre- 

 sents no notable peculiarities beyond the characteristics of the lorica. 

 The spines are like those of T. bulla and T. piscatoris, being more sparse 

 and slender than in T. hispida. Its very considerable size, and often- 

 times its well-developed color, would preclude the obvious suspicion 

 that it represents an immature state of some other species. Moreover, 

 intermediate forms have not been observed. 



Trachelomonas piscatoris (Fisher) Stokes. 



Laguncula piscatoris Fisher. 1880. Proc. Amer. Soc. Micros. 

 Trachelomonas piscatoris Stokes. 1886. Jour. Trentou Nat. Hist. Soc. 



"Lorica flask-shaped, cylindrical, less than twice as long as broad, 

 the surface clothed by numerous short, conical spines ; both extremities 

 equally rounded, the anterior aperture produced into a smooth, cylin- 

 drical, neck-like prolongation, about one-seventh the entire length of 

 the lorica, the frontal border denticulate and often bearing a row of 

 short, conical spines similar to those on the general surface " 



The length of lorica is given by Dr. Stokes, from whom the above is 

 quoted, at the equivalent of 25-39 j". It is a beautiful and very distinct 

 species, not at all rare in Delaware Valley. It is present in most gather- 

 ings from Tinicum, and it occurs abundantly in lily-ponds at Riverton, 

 New Jersey. In shaded situations, or where the water is poor in salts 

 of iron, the lorica is sometimes light in color and thin-walled. This 

 is probably the form referred to, but not adequately described nor at all 

 figured, by Archer (ISSO, Annals and Magazine of Natural History), 

 who suggested in a tentative way the name T^ acanthophora. 



Trachelomonas horrida sp- nov. PL XLI, fig. 6. 



Lorica ovoid, brown, the general surface tuberculate, beset with very 

 long, nearly straight, prismatic, abruptly pointed spines, longer on the 

 ends than on the sides. Aperture plane, or produced into a short 

 trumpet-shaped tube with wavy limb. Monad green, pigment-spot 

 obvious. Flagellum long. 



Fresh-water ditches. Length of lorica 40 /j-. 



This species is at once separated from all others by the character of 

 the spines, as well as by their distribution. These spines are nearly 

 as long as those of T. armata, but are not confined to certain areas, and 

 are straight instead of curved, angular instead of round in cross-section, 

 and pointed like a dagger. Those on the ends are 6 m to 7 ij- long, those 

 on the sides one-half as long. It is also distinguished from T. armata 

 by the tuberculate surface and the character of the aperture. Col- 

 lected! in living condition in Tinicum ditches, June and July, 1905. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 675 



While not plentiful, it presented itself in a number of gatherings con- 

 taining also T. volvocina, hispida and piscatoris. 



This same species has also been collected in Iowa by Prof. C. H. 

 Edmundson, who has kindly sent specimens for identification and 

 comparison with Eastern forms.

ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS FROM THE COLORADO DELTA. 

 LOWER CALIFORNIA. 



BY WITMER STONE. 

 WITH FIELD NOTES BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS. 



Early in 1905 Mr. Samuel N. Rhoads made a trip, in the interest? 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, through the north- 

 western portion of Lower California. The birds and mammals, num- 

 bering respectively 258 and 117 specimens, have been submitted to 

 me for identification, and are listed below with such comments as they 

 demand. Mr. Rhoads has added his field notes on various of the spe- 

 cies, which enhance greatly the value of the report. 



The conditions that prevailed during the expedition were peculiarly- 

 unfavorable to collecting of any sort, the rain, cold and high water 

 being almost unprecedented. The accounts of the botanical expedi- 

 tions sent out later by the New York Botanic Garden over the same 

 route taken by Mr. Rhoads give a good idea of the conditions that pre- 

 vailed (see Journ. N. Y. Bot. Garden, May and June, 1905). 



Mr. Rhoads "embarked at Yuma, Arizona, in an open rowboat. 

 February 4, accompanied by Mr. H. E. Wilder, of Riverside, and a 

 guide. They descended the Colorado river as far as the mouth of the 

 Hardy river, which is a slackwater bayou emptying into the Colorado 

 about ten miles above the head of the Gulf of California. The Hard a- 

 was reached February 8, after an exchange of guides at the Colony. 

 where they were fortunate to secure the services of Frank Tejano, a 

 Cocopah Indian. 



"This stream was then ascended as far as the base of the Cocopah 

 range, reaching Bruce's ranch February 15, Pescadoro Slough on the 

 18th and Cocopah Major Mountain on the 19th. Several days were 

 spent at the last point and also just above the mouth of the Hardy. 



"From camp at the base of the Cocopah Knob, after a stay of nine 

 days, the trip was continued overland to Calexico, on the Californian 

 border, which was reached after five days of the most fatiguing drivinu' 

 and marching through the fresh mud and sloughs of the overflowing 

 Colorado. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 677 



"During the entire trip more than half of the whole number of days 

 were rainy, and the total precipitation was stated to have been more 

 than often aggregates in this desert region for a period of years. The 

 temperature was correspondingly low, on the 13th reaching 34° with 

 ice in the coffee-pot, something the guide had never seen before in his 

 lifetime of forty-five years. On these accounts the animal life of the 

 region was at a standstill and the results of field work most discourag- 

 ing." 



In the list which follows Mr. Rhoads' field notes are given in quota-" 

 tion marks. 



Ovis canadensis cremnobates Elliot. Lower California Sheep. 



Three females, one of which was adult, obtained in the Cocopah 

 Mountains, near camp, February 24; also a weathered skull and other 

 bones of an old male. 



"Numerous in the Cocopah range. Said to abound on the arid 

 slopes and valleys lying between this and the San Pedro Martir 

 range." 



Sigmodon hispidus eremicus Mearns. Western Desert Cotton Rat. > 



Nineteen specimens of various ages, from the mouth of the Hardy 

 river, the type locality for this race. 



"Abounding in the overflow lands where the tules and reeds were a 

 permanent food supply. Not an upland species, but essentially 

 littoral." 



Reithrodontomys longicaudus pallidus Rhoads. Lower California Harvest Mouse. 



Six specimens from the mouth of the Hardy river. 



"Found only in fine grass on the higher banks — situations, however, 

 which would be temporarily overflowed at highest periods of spring 

 tides and freshets. The Sigmodon was abundant in the same loca- 

 tions." 



Neotoma intermedia albigula (Hartley). White-throated Wood Rat. 



Five specimens from the mouth of the Hardy seem to be referable to 

 this race. 



"The large bush nests of this animal were seen at two or three other 

 points in the delta, including the last camp at Mount Major; here they 

 frequented the rocks also, or possibly this was another species. The 

 habits and homes of this animal on the banks of the Hardy resemble 

 those of the mesquite rats in the vicinity of Corpus Christi, Texas. 

 They subsist largely on the bark and twigs as well as the seeds and pods 

 of the mesquite." 




678 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



Peromyscus eremious (Baird). Desert Mouse. 



Two forms of white-footed mice were obtained by -Mr. Rhoads, and 

 typical examples of each were submitted to Mr. W. H. Osgood, of the 

 V. S. Biological Survey, who has kindly identified them. 



The present species was abundant in the Cocopah Mountains, where 

 a series of nineteen specimens was secured. A single female was ob- 

 tained at the mouth of the Hardy, doubtless carried down in the flood, 

 and four were trapped in the hills near the IMexican boundary, on the 

 Colorado river. 



"A rock-loving mountain species, whose haliitat touches upon but 

 not invades that of sonoriensis." 



Peromyscus sonoriensis (Le Conte). Sonora White-footed Mouse. 



This was the prevalent form in the low ground, nineteen specimens 

 being obtained at the mouth of the Hardy and five others on the Colo- 

 rado thirty-five miles below Yuma. Four specimens were also trapped 

 in the Cocopahs with the preceding species. 



"Excessively abundant in the bottoms, preventing the capture of 

 other small rodents, etc., by incessantly springing the traps. Without 

 studying its anatomy, I should predict that this species was more nearly 

 related to gossypinus of the East than to leucopus. I base this view- 

 solely on its habitat and manner of life." 



Perognathus penicillatus angustirostris Osgood. Slender-nosed Pocket Mouse. 



Three specimens from the Cocopahs and one from the Colorado river, 

 near the Mexican boundary. In going over the large series of these 

 mice in the Rhoads collection at the Academy, I find among them three 

 examples of P. fallax pallidus Mearns, obtained at Mission Creek, 

 California, by R. B. Herron. These, as their labels show% had been 

 separated in 1895 as a distinct race of fallax by Mr. Rhoads, but his 

 name has remained in manuscript and the specimens were afterward 

 referred by him to this species. 



Perognathus spinatUS Merriam. Spiny Pocket Mouse. 



Eleven examples, all from the Cocopah ^Mountains. 



"This and the former named inhabit the desert mountain and plain 

 to the edge of the delta bottoms. Their homes are made by tunnelling 

 at the base of greasewood and other low thickset bushes, as well as 

 among the rocky clefts of the hills where any vegetation has a foothold. 

 The entrances to these burrows remain open. They do not plough 

 underground as Blarina, Scalops, Thomomys, etc., but excavate and 

 throw out the dirt largely at the mouth of the burrow, thus raising the 

 vicinity of their bush colonies into slight mounds. Both species may 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILAUELrHIA, 



679 



be caught at the same entrance on successive nights. They are closely 

 associated with the kangaroo rats in these colonies. Judging by the 

 lack of specimens on coldest nights, I judge there is a short period of 

 intermittent hibernation in February." 



Dipodomys merriami arenivagus Elliot. San Felipe Kangaroo Rat. 



Three specimens from the Cocopahs. These seem to be referable 

 to Elliot's race, though whether it is really separable from simiolus I 

 am in doubt. 



"All three were taken at the mouth of the same sand burrow at tlio 

 base of Mount Major, near camp. This and a large white species, 

 probably deserti Stephens, are said by the guides to abound in the 

 sand plains on the borders of the delta all the way to Calexico. ^ If so, 

 this would indicate a continuous distribution toward the habitat ot 

 simiolKs in the Mojave Desert. I doubt the separability of arenivogusr 



Lepus arizonae Allen. Arizona Hare. 



One example from the Colorado river, near the Mexican boundary 

 line, and another from New river, twelve miles from Calexico. 



"A bottom-land species, not abundant because of the overabundance 

 of coyotes." 



Pipistrellus hesperus (Allen). Western Bat. 



One obtained in the Cocopah Mountains, February 21, identified by 

 Mr. J. A. G. Rehn. The margins of the interfemoral membrane as well 

 as the inner portion of the wing margin is whitish. 



Procyon pallidus :^Ierr. Pallid Raccoon. 



A specimen from the mouth of the Hardy river and one from tlie 



Colony. 



"Coons occur everywhere along the river." 



TJrocyon littoralis (Baird). Coast Fox. 



A skull from nine miles west of Bruce's ranch; also a mummified 

 skeleton from :\Iount Major which could not be preserved. 



Canis estor Merriam? Coyote. 



Five skulls and four skins, which seem to be referable to this form; 

 but without topotypes for comparison, it is impossible to satisfactorily 

 identify them. That three species of coyotes occur together iu the 

 San Pedro Martir Mountains, as stated by Mr. Elliot, seems to me very 



unlikely. 



"Mr. Wilder, whose experience with coyotes extends over a wide 

 territory in the far West, told me he never heard the like of those which 




680 PROCEEUIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



nightly sang and yelled us to sleep in the Colorado delta. They were 

 overabundant and easily trapped." 



Tursiops gillii Dall. Gill's Dolphin. 



Une skull, found on the Hard}' river at the base of the Cocopah 

 Mountains, fifty miles above the Gulf. 



Additional Species Observed. 



Odocoileus hemionus eremicus (Mearns). Sonoran Mule Deer. Burro Deer. 



"It was probably this race which we found inhabiting the delta on 

 tlie Californian side. The floods had driven them to the uplands, so 

 they were rarely seen, but their old tracks were abundant. Two speci- 

 mens were shot by a comrade near the last camp, the horns of which 

 were taken home by Mr. Wilder. On the delta this species ruts in Feb- 

 ruary, the fawns being born in August." 

 Antiiocapra americana mexicana Merr. Mexican Antelope. 



"A trip was taken to the base of the mountains, nine miles from 

 Bruce's ranch, for this species, but none were seen. Their old tracks 

 were plentiful. About forty miles south of this point, on the mesas 

 of the San Pedro Martir and ]\Iajor Cocopahs, they are reported to be 

 abundant." 



Castor canadensis frondator Mearns. Arizona Beaver. 



"Several are trapped in winter on the lower Colorado. I examined 

 some fresh hides in a trapper's camp above the Colony, and a large 

 number taken on Pescadoro Slough, where they are reported more 

 abundant. They make no dams nor aii}^ homes in the banks, but raise 

 large flat piles of brush and mud for their homes back in the densely 

 grown sloughs and ponds of the bottoms." 



Felis cougar browni (Merr.). Sonoran Puma? 



"None seen. Our guide, Frank Tejano, denied having met with 

 this species, but had seen their tracks. He seemed to be in awe of 

 them and declined to give his experiences. They are rare." 

 Lynx ruffus peninsularis Thomas. Peninsular Wild Cat? 



"One or two seen. Not rare." 



Taxidea taxus infusca Thomas 1 Badger. 



"Tracks of badgers were seen, as well as holes stated to l)elong to 

 them." 



Thomomys fulvus nigricans Rhoads? Lower Sonoran Mole Rat. 



"A few places indicated the presence of some species of this genus 

 even in the bottom lands. None were captured."

Birds. 



Fodilymbus podiceps (Linn.). Pied-billed Grebe. 



One specimen from month of Hardy river, February 1 1 . 

 "Only one seen." 



Larus Philadelphia (Ord.). Bonaparte's Gull. 



One secured at the mouth of the Hardy and one thirty miles below 

 Yuma. 



"Very scarce and mostly in a half-starved condition, appearing to 

 suffer greatly from the unusual cold. 



Nycticorax n. naevius (Bodd.). Night Heron. 



One at "Colony," February 7. 



"Without exception the most abundant water bird on the river. 

 Some individuals appeared to belong to the yellow-crowned species." 

 Symphemia semipalmata inornata Brewst. Western Willet. 



One obtained at the mouth of the Hardy. 



"The only one noted." 

 Lophortyx gambelii (Gambel). Gambel's Quail. 



A number of specimens from the Cocopah Major jNIountains, several 

 from the mouth of the Hardy, and one fifty miles below Yuma. 



"They were subsisting almost wholly on the mistletoe berries growing 

 on the mesquites." 



Aceipiter velox (Wils.). Sharp-shinned Hawk. 



One obtained on the Colorado thirty miles below Yuma. 

 "Rarelj^ seen." 



Falco sparverius phalaena (Lesson). Desert Sparrow Hawk. 



Specimens obtained on the Hardy river and at Bruce's ranch. 



"A scarce bird." 

 Bubo virginianus pallescens Stone. 



One specimen from midway up the Hardy river, and another without 

 locality. 



"Found nesting at Bruce's ranch and everywhere abundant." 

 Centurus uropygialis (Baird). Gila Woodpecker. 



Specimens from the Hardy river and Cocopah Major Mountains, as 

 well as on the Colorado near the Mexican boundary. These birds are 

 a,ll typical. 



"These also lived largely on the mistletoe berries." 



Dryobates soalaris lucasanus (Xantus). Saint Lucas Woodpecker. 



Two specimens from Colony and two from the Cocopah Major Moun- 

 tains. The white on the tail feathers is variable, but less so in the 




682 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept,, 



females than in the males. The Colony specimens approach hairdi, 

 but the others are lucasanus. A specimen in the Academy's collection 

 obtained in June, 1852, by Col. McCall, in southern California, is a 

 marked example of lucasanus. After examining a number of these 

 birds, I can see no reason for elevating the Lower Calif ornian race to 

 specific rank, as has recently been done by ]\Ir. William Brewster. 

 ''These birds were extremely wild and difficult to secure." 



Calypte COStae (Bourc). Costa's Hummingbird. 



Two specimens from Cocopah Major Mountains. 

 "These tiny birds were breeding, one of the specimens shot showing 

 bodily marks of protracted incubation on the 21st of February." 



Selasphorus rufas (Gmel.). Rufous Hummingbird. 



One example from the Cocopahs. 



"This bird was going through its aerial love antics in February with 

 all the energy of a midsummer madness. This was the more remark- 

 able as all other bird and animal life was in its deepest winter lethargy 

 during my entire stay at this camp, and the temperature frequent!}^ 

 fell to near 45°. This coincides with the actions of riifus in the 

 vicinity of Puget Sound, as observed by me in early April, 1903, 

 where I found it breeding though frost frequently formed at night." 



Myiarclius cinereus (Lawr.). Ash-throated Flycatcher. 



Specimens from Colony and Cocopahs. 



"Of uniform but scanty distribution. They nested on the tops of 

 the densely wooded' cottonwood and willow bottoms, uttering frequent 

 ejaculations as they darted upward for insects. Generalh- in quar- 

 tettes, sometimes five or six within hearing." 



Sayornis saya (Bonap.). Say's Phoebe. 



One from Bruce's ranch and another from the California-^Iexican 

 boundary on the Colorado. 



"Wherever we reached bluffs or other elevations not bottom land, 

 this solitaire of the mountains and foothills is wont to appear. Its 

 weird and plaintive cry is in impressive keeping with these barren 

 solitudes." 



Sayornis nigricans (Sw.). Black Phoebe. 



Obtained at Bruce's ranch, and at the mouth of the Hardy ri\-er. 

 The under-tail coverts appear perfectly white, although the longer ones 

 are dusk}^ centrally for more than half their length. 



"One of the most lively bits of bird life, which relieved the tedium 

 of our boat journey, was the frequent sight of these birds sitting on the 




1905.] XATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 683 



floating drift and hawking flies and other insects from the steaming 

 surface of Colorado of a chilly morning." 



Pyrocephalus rubineus mexioanus (Scl.)- Vermilion Flycatcher. 



Several from the mouth of the Hardy, and also from Pescadoro 

 Slough. 



"We were sure to find one or more pairs of these in the mesquite 

 groves. They seem to continue their conjugal attachments all winter, 

 some pairs being inseparable. They furnished the only strong bit of 

 color to be seen in the wintiy landscape of the Colorado delta in Febru- 

 ary. The males on warm days were performing their whimsical little 

 flight songs and tumbling feats, but there was no other sign or sugges- 

 tion that this had anything to do with sexual excitement." 



Corvus corax sinuatus (Wagl.). American P.aven. 



One obtained at the mouth of the Hardy. 



"Numerous everj-where. Some of the ravens may have been the 

 white-necked species. While at Cocopah Major I was entertained by 

 the love antics and really wonderful medley of sounds which a love-sick 

 raven is able to make. Some of these are truly melodious modulations 

 of the so-called 'croak,' and run through Cfuite a slice of the gamut. 

 In addition to this they can tumble, twist, dive, soar and sport about 

 the fleeting form of their mate with all the abandon and daring of less 

 sedate and more elegant masters of the air." 



Molothrus ater obscurus (Gmel.)- Dwarf Cowbird. 



One example taken on the lower Colorado, above Colony. 



"They were associated with flocks of Redwings. Some were seen 

 near Pescadoro Slough." 



Agelaius phoenioeus sonoriensis Ridgw. Sonoran Redwing. 



Obtained along the Colorado above Colony, and at the mouth of the 

 Hardy, as well as at Pescadoro Slough. I find it very difficult to sepa- 

 rate this form from neutralis, and riuestion whether the two will prove 

 distinct when full series representing all seasonal variations are avail- 

 able for comparison. The specimens under consideration might be 

 either form so far as measurements go, but the stripes on the breast of 

 the females appear narrower than in San Diegan birds. 



Sturnella magna neglecta (And.). Western Meadow Lark. 



Several obtained about the mouth of the Hardy and one farther up 

 the river, all of them typical neglecta. 



"A rare bird except in open savannas along the Hardy river at two 

 or three points." 




684 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis (Say). House Finch. 



Three specimens taken on the Cocopah Major Mountains. 

 "Small flocks in the foothills: none seen clown the river." 



Astragalinus lawrenoei (Cass.). Lawrence's Goldfinch. 



Three examples from the Cocopahs. 



"Two of this, or possibly another Goldfinch, were seen on a mesa 

 above Colony." 



Passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus (Bonap.). Western Savanna Sparrow. 



A number from the mouth of the Hardy river and from Bruce's ranch. 

 Several of them are in the spring molt. 



"This species, with flocks of Brewer's and Chipping Sparrows and 

 Abert's Towhee, were in great numbers in some favorable mesquite 

 bottoms where grass weeds and mistletoe berries formed an abundant 

 harvest." 



Passerculus rostratus (Cass.). Large-billed Sparrow. 



Five specimens from the mouth of the Hardy, all of them typical 

 rostratus. 



"These occupied a narrow strip or beach of marsh grass or sedge 

 bordering the river and reaching far back over the mesquite bottom to 

 higher open ground. They kept close to the river bank when flushed, 

 while the Savannas flew across to the upland. Al)out twenty rostratus 

 were seen." 



Zonotricliia leucophrys gambelii (Nutt.). Intermediate Sparrow. 



Obtained at Bruce's ranch and Cocopah Mountains. 



Spizella socialis arizonse Coues. Western Chipping Sparrow. 



Specimens from mouth of the Hardy and Bruce's ranch. 



Spizella breweri Cass. Brewer's Sparrow. 



Found at Bruce's ranch and on the Cocopahs. 



Janco hyemalis (Linn.). Slate-colored Junco. 



One typical male example from the Cocopah Major ^^lountains, 

 Februar}^ 24. 



Junco oreganus thurberi Anthony. Thurber's Junco. 



Three specimens from the Cocopahs, one of them not typical, but 

 nearer to this than any other form. 



Amphispiza bilineata deserticola Ridgw. Desert Sparrow. 



One obtained on the Cocopah Mountains. 



"Two or three were found in the chapparal, very wary indeed. The 

 males occasionallv uttered a sweet sons;. I saw no others." 




190.5.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 685 



Melospiza cinerea fallax (Baird). Desert Song Sparrow. 



A number of specimens from the mouth of the Hardy, Bruce's ranch 

 and the Colorado sixty miles below Yuma. 



"The song of this form is precisely like that of our Eastern bird, and 

 was a constant reminder of the winter minstrelsy of my home in the 

 Delaware River Valley. They are very abundant in the whole delta." 



Pipilo aberti Baird. Abert's Towhee. 



Obtained on the Colorado and Hardy rivers at various points, and 

 in the Cocopah ^lountains. 



"This peculiar or, rather, original bird character is abundant. In 

 habits and appearance and in character also it reminds one of a female 

 cardinal Grosbeak. Its voice or call note completes the illusion. Its 

 song I never heard. That, together with its anatomy, may be sufficient 

 proof that the systematists have not gone wrong in naming it Pipilo. 

 No cardinals seem to inhabit its rendezvous in the Colorado delta, and 

 that is another puzzling factor in the life history of Abert's Towhee." 



Iridoprocne bicolor (Vieill.). Tree Swallow. 



One example from Bruce's ranch. 

 "Several flocks seen." 



Fhainopepla niteus (Swains). Phainopepla. 



Two examples on the Colorado fifty miles below Yuma and one from 

 the Cocopahs. 



"Wherever mesquites and their parasitic berries abounded plenty of 

 these shining crested fellows plaintively ffitted about from one high 

 perch to another." 

 Lanius ludovioianus gambeli Ridgw. California Shrike. 



Three specimens from the mouth of the Hardy river come nearer to 

 gambeli than any other race, though they are not quite typical. 



"Another was taken near Pescadoro Slough and several seen at the 

 Mount Major camp." 

 Helminthophila celata lutescens (Ridgw.). Lutescent Warbler. 



One obtained at Bruce's ranch, February 16. 



"No others seen." 



Dendroica auduboni (Towns.). Audubon's Warbler. 



One from Colony and one from the Colorado river near the Mexican 

 boundary. 



"Exceedingly abundant everywhere along our route." 

 Anthus pensilvanicus (Lath.). American Pipit. 



One specimen secured on the Hardy river, February 18. 



"A very few seen on the Hardy only." 




686 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



Toxostoma crissale Henry. Crissal Thrasher. 



Two from the Cocopah Mountains. 



"About five seen altogether. Occasionally one would sing a little, 

 but they were only beginning. Only found in the foothill chapparal 

 above high-water mark, and ver}- shy and cunning in their terres- 

 trial manoeuvres to outwit the man with a gun." 

 Heleodytes brunneioapillus couesi (Sharpe). 



Specimens from various points along the Hardy river from its mouth 

 to the Cocopah Mountains. 



"Frequenting both the arid foothills and the mesquite l^ottoms." 



Salpinctes obsoletus (Say). Rock Wren. 



Six specimens from the Cocopahs and one from the Colorado river 

 near the Mexican boundary in southeastern California. 



"A wonderful member of a wonderful family. Its life history, who 

 can tell it? Sprite, sylph, orpheus of the barren mountains, what man 

 could put thy likeness on paper or reveal to the reader thy inmost life? 

 Now that the quest is over and I see seven skins lying side by side in 

 the tray named and numbered, I trow they will be the last of that 

 happy family to serve the demands of science." 



Troglodytes aedon parkmanii (Aud.). Parkman's Wren. 



One from Bruce's ranch. I follow Mr. Ridgway in uniting 'park- 

 manii and aztecus. 



"A few, two or three, were seen at Mount ]\Iajor." 

 Telmatodytes palustris paludicola (Baird). Tul^ Wren. 



Two specimens obtained at the mouth of the Hardy. 



"They were numerous near our first camp on the Hardy, keeping 

 close to the tules along the river, bank. Very few seen farther up." 



Telmatodytes palustris plesius (Oberholser). Western Marsh Wren. 



One example of this race, associated with the above. 

 "No others noted." 



Auriparus flaviceps (Sund.). Verdin. 



Specimens from the mouth of the Hardy, Bruce's ranch and the 

 Cocopahs. 



"Uniformly distributed in the mesquite. One was caught in its 

 gourd-like roosting nest. It sat with its tail projecting from the open- 

 ing, so as to void all excrement on the ground during the night and keep 

 its winter quarters cleanly." 



Segulus calendula (Linn.). Ruby-crowned Kinglet. 



One specimen. 



"Many seen on both stream-;." 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 687 



Polioptila oaerulea obscura Ridgw. Western Gnatcatcher. 



One from the Mexican boundary and one from Bruce's ranch. 

 "Abundant and always making a fuss out of proportion to its size."

Specimens from Bruce's ranch, Pescadoro Slough and the Cocopah 

 Mountains. 



Mimus polyglottos leuoopterus (Vigors). Western Mockingbird. 



Three examples from the Cocopahs. 



" I do not remember seeing any other specimens than those noted at 

 our Mount ]\Iajor camp. They were beginning to sing."

Phalaorocorax mexicanus (Brandt). Mexican Cormorant. 



Exceedingly abundant, fishing in great shoals with the pelicans. 



Peleoanus erythrorhynchos Gmel. American White Pelican. 



"Increasingly abundant as Yuma disappeared in om" wake, these 

 splendid lordly birds were an ever-present source of delight and admi- 

 ration during the remainder of our journey. At our camp on the upper 

 Hardy at Mount Major, they came regularly every morning to fish in a 

 lagoon formed by the recent floods directly in front of the cami^. 

 Sometimes there would be half a thousand of them, with hundreds of 

 Cormorants plunging about at once. On the outskirts of the fray Great 

 White Egrets gathered the fragments of this royal feast.

October 3. 

 Mr. Arthur Erwin Brown, Vice-President, in the Chair. 



Twenty-nine persons present. 



The work of the Academy since the last meeting in May was reported 

 on by the Curators, the Librarian and the Secretaries. 



The Chair announced the death, September 18, 1905, of General 

 Isaac J. Wistar, whereupon the following minute was unanimously 

 adopted : 



The Academy desires to record its profound regret at the death of 

 General Isaac Jones Wistar. 



His long service to the Academy as President, Councillor and Chair- 

 man of the Committee on Finance, was coincident from the beginning 

 with the course of active development which has marked its later 

 years, in the advancement of which no movement designed to promote 

 its material welfare, or its usefulness in research, has ever failed to 

 receive earnest support from his forceful energy. Courteous and 

 impartial as the Chairman of its meetings, wise and suggestive as a 

 member of its Council, expert and judicious in controlling its invest- 

 ments, the loss to the Academy of a faithful and efficient officer is 

 felt by its members even less than their personal loss of a genial and 

 welcome associate. 



The Publication Committee reported that papers under the following 

 titles had been offered for publication since the last meeting : 



"The Sphagnum Frog of New Jersey, Rana virgatipes Cope," by 

 Henry W. Fowler (June 1).

 and Y. Hirase. 



A paper entitled "Some Vertebrates of the Florida Keys," by Henry 

 W. Fowler, was withdrawn by the author. 



The following papers, by Mr. Clarence B. Moore, were accepted for 

 publication in the Journal, and will constitute the second part of the 

 thirteenth volume, quarto series: 



"Certain Aboriginal Mounds of the Tombigbee River." 

 "Certain Aboriginal Mounds of the Black Warrior River." 

 " Certain Aboriginal Mounds of Mobile Bay and of Mississippi Sound." 

 " Miscellaneous Livestigations." 



The Identity of Eutcenia atrata Kenn. — Mr. Arthur Erwin Brown 

 stated that in the Report of the Pacific Railroad Survey (1860) 

 Kennicott described four garter snakes from California under the name 

 of Eutcenia atrata. Two of his specimens are still in the United States 

 National Museum, and a third is in the Academy's collection. In 

 1892 Professor Cope established Eutcenia inferncdis vidua upon the two 

 co-types of E. atrata in the National Museum, and subsequently marked 

 the Academy's specimen with the same name. Cope's description 

 was referred by Van Denburgh in 1897 to E. elegans, with the statement 

 that this color-form seems to occur only on "the coast slope of the 

 peninsula of San Francisco." In the same paper he cites E. atrata 

 Kenn. as a probable synonym of E. leptocephala B. and G. In 1901 the 

 speaker recognized the identity of Cope's types with those of Kennicott, 

 and referred them to the highly variable E. leptocephala. 



A collection of twenty or more living E. elegans, received by the 

 Zoological Society from Santa Cruz county, just south of San Francisco, 

 contains four examples of the vidua color-form. These correspond 

 with the one type of atrata in the Academy's collection, and with the 

 detailed description of the two in the National Museum with which 

 Dr. Stejneger has kindly supplied me, the only difference of moment 

 being that the four from Santa Cruz have nineteen rows of dorsal 

 scales, while the types of atrata each have nineteen on the anterior 

 third and seventeen on the middle of the body. It is significant that 

 three red elegans from Santa Cruz show a parallel change from the nor- 

 mal number of twenty-one rows to nineteen, about the place where nine- 

 teen drops to seventeen in the atrata specimens. This scale variation is 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 693 



quite within the range of elegans, which sometimes has nineteen, and 

 occasionally seventeen rows; and as in the remaining details of scutella- 

 tion, as well as in other characters distinctive of elegans, such as the 

 yellow chin and throat, the usually short hinder chin-shields, and the 

 frequent presence of red markings on the ventrals, there is complete 

 agreement, it seems that these snakes must be regarded as specimens 

 of E. elegans, showing a more or less uniform dark olive color with a 

 wide yellow dorsal stripe and little or no indication of laterals, cor- 

 related with a tendency to a reduced number of scale rows, and occur- 

 ring, as far as is known, in a restricted area. Such a form requires 

 recognition as a subspecies, for which the proper name obviously is 

 Eutcenia elegans atrata Kenn. Cope's name E. infernalis vidua being a 

 pure synonym. 



Anomalies such as these, occurring in some numbers and over a 

 period of at least some generations, belong to the mutations of De Vries, 

 but their proper assignment to any one of his special categories of the 

 constituent parts of species i? not so clear. It was pointed out on a 

 previous occasion that E. sirtalis, with nineteen rows of scales, is prob- 

 ably the parent species of the genus, in which case the occasional 

 appearance of that number in a species normally possessing twenty-one 

 rows might be, in De Vries' view, an outbreak of a tendency to specific 

 reversion to that number, and would fall under the definition of ata- 

 vistic or degressive varieties; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to 

 show, and would indeed be impossible when there is no knowledge 

 of the line of descent, that the case may be no more than individual 

 loss of two rows, a view to which color is lent by the further reduction 

 in three specimens to seventeen rows. This mode of change would 

 class them as retrogressive varieties. And again, the gain of a new 

 color-pattern, occurring nowhere in a possibly ancestral form, brings 

 them within the definition of elementary species. In fact, these speci- 

 mens seem to demonstrate the lack of value of these theoretical defini- 

 tions to the practical work of the systematist. 



The evidence for the evolutionary value of mutations being so scanty 

 among animals, it is not amiss to direct attention to the instability 

 of nearly the whole genus Eutcenia, and especially the species of the 

 Pacific coast. This condition suggests that if the theory of alternating 

 periods of stability and mutation be well founded, this group of species 

 may at the present time be passing through a period of extreme muta- 

 bility.

Alexander Wilson's Tombstone. — Mr. Nathaniel E. Janney re- 

 marked that on his first visit in 1862 to the grave of Alexander Wilson 

 in the Old Swedes' Churchyard on Water street, north of Washing-

THE PLANT FORMATIONS OF THE BERMUDA ISLANDS. 

 BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



No phytogeographic sketch has ever been pubhshed of this region, 

 which comprehends the archipelago of larger and smaller islands lying 

 south of the Gulf Stream in the western Atlantic between 32° 14' and 

 32° 23' N. Latitude and 64° 38' and 64° 53' W. Longitude, thus being 

 about600 miles from the nearest land, Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. 

 It is evident from a study of the composition of the Bermuda flora that 

 it is of comparatively recent introduction. Briefly, says Hemsley,^ " it 

 is not of purely West Indian origin, but was derived from the West In- 

 dies and that region of southeastern North America where the West 

 Indian and North American types of vegetation overlap each other." 

 There being no running streams, the original flora of Bermuda was es- 

 sentially of a xerophytic type. The islands have been settled so long 

 that the character of the original vegetation has been altered, and we 

 must infer from the appearance of the flora at the present what its con- 

 dition was when Bermuda was first discovered. The following for- 

 mations, according to the observations of the writer in June, 1905. 

 may be distinguished. 



Marine Algal Formation. 



The marine algae of Bermuda are mainly those which have accustomed 

 themselves to living on a shore composed of limestone rocks (reef rocks, 

 or eolian rocks) exposed to the action of the surge, or which live in lime- 

 stone, or coral sand in the comparatively placid water of salt water 

 lakes, bays, or lagoons. 



According to my observations the algae of the rocks exposed to the 

 surge are Sargassum bacciferum, Dictyota Barteyresiana, Halimeda 

 tridens, H. tuna, Zonaria lobata, Haliseris polypodioides , Anadyomene 

 flabellata, C odium tomentosum, Neomeris dumetosus, Ulva lactuca, U. 

 latissima, Rhodymenia palmata, Padina pavonia, Galaxaura rugosa, 

 G. lapidescens and others. Those of the tidal pools formed in the 

 rock hollows are : Padina pavonia, Digenia simplex, Acetabularia cren-

ulata, Caiderpa mexicana, C. racemosa uvifera, Ulva laduca, etc. The 

 sandy bottoms beneath mangrove trees or in the channels leading 

 from salt water sounds or ponds to the sea are characterized by 

 Halimeda tridens, Penicillus capitatus, Caulerpa taxifolia, C. cupressoides 

 lycopodium, Padina pavonia. The salt-water ponds, especially at 

 Walsingham, are fed by underground channels, so that the water in 

 them rises and falls with the tide. Here grow several interesting 

 marine algae, such as Valonia utricularis, Caulerpa plumaris, C. 

 racemosa, and Colpomenia sinuosa. 



Mangrove Swamp Formation. 



The mangrove swamps occur at the heads of bays, especially along 

 the south shore of the Bermudas and in the salt-water ponds which 

 are here and there found distributed over the islands. The vegetation 

 consists either of a pure growth of Rhizophora mangle with its prop 

 roots extending in all directions, or a pure growth of Avicennia niiida 

 (in flower in June) with its numerous pencil-like root knees projecting 

 through the sticky mud at low tide. In some places, as in Castle Har- 

 bor, both Avicennia nitida and Rhizophora mangle are in association, 

 and frequently one finds arising from the mud the green brush-like 

 tops of Penicillus capitatus. Little else grows beneath the dense 

 shade formed by the overarching crowns of these trees. Frequently a 

 morass is formed by either Rhizophora or Avicennia taking possession 

 of a shallow inland pond which thus becomes a swamp. Several such 

 swamps are found near the coast on the north shore of Bermuda where 

 Avicennia nitida has taken possession and has excluded everything 

 else, except Pluchea purpurascens, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Salicornia 

 fruticosa, Heliotropium curassavicum and a low sedge. In the salt- 

 water pools in such swamps at Shelly Bay is found Ulva lactuca, and 

 on the projecting roots of Avicennia nitida a moss-like growth of con- 

 siderable bushiness. 



Salt Marsh Formation. 



This is found at the head of bays and elsewhere where the soil is in- 

 fluenced by the tides. In such a marsh along Harrington Sound the 

 writer noted Salicornia jruticosa, Heliotropium curassavicum, Sesuvium 

 portulacastrum and a number of sedges. The projecting roots from a 

 single tree of Avicennia were also observed together with the long up- 

 right culms of a form of the crabgrass, Stenotaphrum americanum. 

 The rare Statice Lefroyi also is a salt marsh plant. 




1905.] natural sciences of philadelphia. 697 



Brackish Marsh Formation. 



This exists in depressions some distance inland where marshes occur 

 such as Smith's Parish Marsh, Devonshire Marsh, Pembroke Marsh 

 all of which were investigated by me. Smith's Parish Marsh is devoid 

 of trees. Here in the soil rendered brackish by underground channels 

 grow Typha angustifolia in pure association, Baccharis heterophylla in 

 thickets (Baccharis Association,) Dichromena leucocephala, Scirpus 

 lacustris, while Osmunda cinnamomea is frequent. Acrosticum aureum 

 forms pure associations at the edge of this marsh. 



Devonshire Marsh is a large area with a few pools of water in the de- 

 pressions. It gives evidence that it was once a pond. Juniperus her- 

 mudiana, Sabal Blackburniana and Baccharis heterophylla have en- 

 croached on this marsh so as to shade it. On the ground in the wettest 

 places, according to Coulter,^ are Hydrocotyle asiatica, Herpestis mon- 

 nieria, Mentha viridis and a white bracted sedge, Dichromena leuco- 

 cephala. On the drier ground, Osmunda regalis and 0. cinnamomea 

 become abundant, while in the still drier peaty soil, according to my 

 observations, Pteris (Pteridium) aquilina caudata is growing vigorously. 

 Here also occur two other plants, Cladonia and Leucobryum. Typha 

 angustifolia is in some places in pure association. Acrosticum aureum 

 also forms pure association here and there in this marsh. The pools 

 are occupied by two species of Sphagnum, Proserpinaca palustris 

 and Lemna minor. Pembroke Marsh is characterized by somewhat 

 similar associations of plants; but in addition to the plants noticed 

 above. Governor Lefroy^ mentions several other plants pecuhar to 

 it, such as Nasturtium officinale (in water channels), Ascijrum crux- 

 andrece, Kosteletzkya virginica, Waltheria americana ( =indica), Eclipta 

 erecta, Pluchea odorata, Ceratophyllum demersum, Kyllinga monocephala, 

 Scirpus validus, Cladium occidentale ( = germanicum) and Spiranthes 

 brevilabrus, the only orchid of Bermuda. The omnipresent cedar is 

 found along the edge of this marsh together with Sabal Blackburniana 

 which invades it. In a small pool grows Lemna minor. 



Sand Dune Formation. 



Sand dunes occur typically along the south shore of Bermuda ^t the 

 head of reentrant bays between stretches of rocky coast. Several low 

 dunes are found on the north shore as at Shelly Bay. The middle

beach is covered with masses of Sargassum, washed ashore at high 

 tide. The upper beach at the foot of the dunes is characterized by 

 the presence of Cakile cequalis, occasional clumps of Tournefortia gna- 

 phalodes, Sccevola Phiniieri and Croton maritimus. Ifomma -pes-caprce 

 sends its long runners down from the slopes of the dunes, associated 

 with Sccevola Plumieri, Stenotaphrum americanum. A little back of 

 the crest of dunes are found Tournefortia gnapholades, Ipomoea pes- 

 caprce, Sccevola Plumieri, Juniperus hermudiana (wind-swept form), 

 Sisyrynchium hermudianum, Lepidium virginicum, Euphorbia huxijolia, 

 Canavalia obtusifolia, Opuntia vulgaris. On the dunes at Tuckertown, 

 Sccevola Plumieri forms extensive tracts in pure association (SciEvola 

 Association). Solidago sempervirens, as in the eastern United States, 

 is also a dune plant, together with the glaucous and hairy forms of 

 Borrichia arhorescens and Dodoncea viscosa. Conocarpus erectus forms 

 thickets which in some places protects the dune crest. Here we have 

 a mangrove plant occurring on sand dunes under perhaps similar eco- 

 logic conditions as in salt water. Stenotaphrum americanum forms 

 mats on the lee slopes and a tall fennel, Fosniculum vulgare, is also very 

 abundant. 



The dunes in Paget on the south shore are high, but since the set- 

 tlement of the country they have been captured by the encroachment 

 of various exotic plants such as Nerium oleander, Lantana camara, L. cro- 

 cea, while Croton maritimus, Canavalia obtusifolia, Dodoncea viscosa, 

 Borrichia arborescens and Passiflora suberosa are among the more 

 important native plants. Yucca aloifolia forms clumps on low sandy 

 hills at Shelly Bay in association with Ipomoea pes-caprce, Tournefortia 

 gnaphalodes and Opuntia sp. 



Cliff Rock Formation. 



The coast line of Bermuda is generally rocky and the waves have 

 honeycombed the rocks into jagged forms with sea caves hollowed out 

 beneath. These rocks support a characteristic vegetation consisting 

 of the hairy and smooth forms of Borrichia arborescens, prostrate trees 

 of Conocarpus erectus, clumps of Solidago sempervirens , Lantana involu- 

 crata, L. Camara, Euphorbia buxifolia, the crabgrass, Stenotaphrum 

 americanum (covering all the available soil on the rocks), while wind- 

 swept trees of Juniperus bermudiana. Yucca aloifolia and dwarf pal- 

 mettos Sabal Blackburniana, also abound in some places. Coccoloba uvi- 

 fera in Bermuda seems to prefer the rocky shores to those of the sand. 

 Sesuvium portulacastrum and Lippia nodi/lora are also rock plants 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 699 



while in one place I collected the introduced Linaria elatine trailing 

 over the ground on the limestone rocks. 



Cedar Forest Formation. 

 This formation has been dignified by the name of forest although 

 no true forest exists on the islands, for the reason that the growth 

 of the cedar trees Juniperus bermudiana is too open and the trees are 

 not tall and dominant in the forest sense. All of the hillsides and 

 hill summits not under cultivation are covered with the cedar 

 Juniperus bermudiana with the admixture of Sabal Blackburrnana 

 This species of juniper is a rapid growing ^^^/^^^^Tl'Lt 

 merchantable size (two to three feet in diameter) but it ditteis 

 from the eastern American species (J. virgimana) in branching moie 

 freely. It produces fruit in abundance. It is hard to determine 

 the character of the original undergrowth. Now it consists of two 

 species of Lantaua (L. imolucraia, L. camara), the prevadmg Ner^u:m 

 oleander, Lvppin nodiflora, Solidago sempervirens and _S^s1/r^nc^^^m 

 bermudianum. The rock crevices are filled with a d^icate endemic 

 fern, Adiantum bellum. Bryophyllum calycinum (the f^oppers ot the 

 natives) is perhaps the most abundant plant in the ^"^^^ergrow*^' f 

 is found in all parts of the islands. The ground beneath the cedars is 

 carpeted with the crabgrass Stenotaphrum americanum m the absence 

 of other plants. Here and there the botanist meets with an mtro- 

 duced tree, such as Citharexylum quadrangulare , Buddleia amencana, 

 Crescentia cujetc, Hura crepitans, Duranta Plnmieri, which together 

 with certain weeds enter into this formation and change its constitu- 

 tion In abandoned cellars surrounded by cedars, one frequently 

 sees Ficus carica, Nicotiana glauca, Bryophyllum calycinum, etc. 



Limestone Sinks Forest Formation. 

 The so-called Walsingham Tract and several places near Harring- 

 ton Sound on the south shore are characterized by the Presence of 

 numerous depressions, or sinks, as well as several caves. The Wal- 

 singham Tract, a narrow ridge of land about two miles long, ajid from 

 a quarter to half a mile wide, which separates Castle Harbor from 

 Harrington Sound, contains within its bounds nearly the whole of the 

 indigenous flora of the islands. The following list of plants given by 

 Lefroy includes plants of West Indian origin and their survival onthe 

 Bermudas is, I think, due to their growth in the limestone depressions 

 many feet below the general surface, protected from the cutting blasts

of the ocean breezes, and in situations where the soil moisture is greater 



than on the surface of the hills above. 



Ampelopsis (Parthenocissus) Asplenium crenulatum 



quinquejolia Callicarpa ferruginea 



Asplenium myriophyllum Dodoncea viscosa 



Chiococca racemosa Eugenia axillaris ( = monticola) 



Elceodendron xylocarpum Caesalpinia (Guillandina) honducella 



Forestiera porulosa Jasminwn gracile 



Ipomoea purpurea Passiflora ciliata ( = f(£tida) 



Jatropha curcas Psilotum triquetrum 



Peperomia ohtusifolia Pteris heterophylla 



Psychotria undata Trema {Sponia) Lamarckiana 



Sicyos angulatus Xanthoxylum Clava-Herculis 



Triumfetta semitriloha 



According to my observations the following trees form a large part 

 of the vegetation of one of the sinks: Celtis mississippiensis. Citrus 

 limonium, Ficus carica, Musa Cavendishii (planted), Mclia azederach, 

 Laniana camara, L.involucrata, while Stenotaphrum americanum abounds 

 and Asplenium trichomanes together with Rhus toxicodendron are found 

 on the sloping sides of such depressions. Two vines are abundant and 

 loop themselves across the trees, viz., Cardiospermum halicacabum and 

 Jasminum gracile. Commelina agraria { = nudiflora) also occurs in such 

 sinks. 



At Walsingham, Juniperus hermudiana prevails mixed with 8abal 

 Blackburniana, Celtis mississippiensis, Citharexylum quadrangidare, 

 Calophyllum calaha, etc., while the trees are festooned with Jasminum 

 gracile, Rhus toxicodendron and Ipomoza purpurea. Peperomia oh- 

 tusifolia and several ferns are found on the rough rocks in the bottom 

 of the sinks, together with Bryophyllum calycinum and one or two spe- 

 cies of Lantana. Citrus limonium and Musa Cavendishii are also 

 present in this jungle of plants. 



Scrub Formation. 

 This formation is due to the hand of man. After the cedars are cut 

 down, if the land is neglected and allowed to stand without cultiva- 

 tion it is covered by a growth of several species of Lantana, L. camara 

 and L. involucrata. Bryophyllum calycinum also abounds together 

 with many introduced weeds and thickets of Nerium oleander. Many 

 of the hillsides in Bermuda are covered with this worthless scrub. 

 Later perhaps under favorable conditions Juniperus hermudiana appears, 

 but the flora is never restored to its original condition because the sage 

 bush plants always form an important constituent of the undergrowth.

702 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



discover the cause which has produced this absohitely unique kind of 

 palm-stem. 



The explanation is found in the manner in which palm stems grow 

 in general and the influence of the meteorologic and soil (edaphic) con- 

 ditions on the cells of the growing crown. It is a well-known fact 

 that the primary root of all palms soon perishes and is replaced by ad- 

 ventitious roots springing from the base of the stem. It is some years 

 before the stem appears above the surface of the ground. In the mean- 

 time, the circumference of the growing point is continually increas- 

 ing, producing successively larger leaves, so that the much-compressed 

 axis forms an inverted cone, which is kept in position by the numerous 

 adventitious roots. Finally, a rosette of normal-sized leaves is pro- 

 duced and the stem grows erect, forming a cylindric structure, the 

 diameter of which varies widely in different species, but which, once 

 formed, shows no secondary increase in thickness by the formation of 

 new elements, so that the diameter of the stem remains almost uni- 

 formly the same from the base to the top of the tree. There is, how- 

 ever, an increase in diameter in the older stems of some palms which 

 causes the gradual tapering upwards which is sometimes observed. 

 This increase is due to the expansion of the parenchymatous fun- 

 damental tissue which separates the vascular bundles, accompanied 

 by an increase in the cell-cavity and in the thickness of the walls of 

 the sclerenchymatous fibers which support the bundles. 



Evidently, we can explain the hour-glass caudices in the Bermuda 

 palmetto by the general application of principles of palm-stem growth 

 described above. If we remember that the diameter of the cylindric 

 palm-stem is determined by the dividing cells of the rosette, or crown 

 of green leaves, then any environmental condition which influences 

 the growth and division of this terminal mass of meristematic cells 

 influences in a direct waj^ the diameter of the stem. We have already 

 alluded to the fact that the leaves of the Bermuda palmetto in ex- 

 tremely rocky and dry situations are j^ellowish-green and smaller 

 than those of a tree in correspondingly rich soil. Fig. 9 perhaps 

 best represents a tree found in an extremely dry situation with 

 a trunk that gradually tapers upward, showing that in youth the 

 tree made a rapid and vigorous growth, but that in subsequent years 

 the conditions which have influenced the crown growth of this par- 

 ticular tree have been unusually unfavorable. Now, if we apply this 

 discovery to a study of other trees, many forms of which are figured 

 on Plate XLII, we have the solution of the question concerning the 

 apparent anomalous condition of the stem structure. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 703 



Given alternating periods of dry and wet weather, or given condi- 

 tions which are at seasons prejudicial to the best growth of this palmetto, 

 we would find alternate constrictions and enlargements of the stem in 

 response to the environmental conditions. In seasons favorable to 

 growth, the growing apex of the stem would expand itself with a cor- 

 respondingly larger crown of leaves and increased diameter growth of 

 the stem. During dry periods, the apex would become contracted, the 

 crown of leaves smaller and the stem diameter correspondingly con- 

 stricted, or contracted. The stem diameter is controlled by the size of the 

 crown, and the size of the crown is in direct response to the meteor- 

 ologic, edaphic and physiologic conditions which surround the tree. 

 A comparison of figs. 18 and 12, representing trees growing in wet 

 marshy ground, with figs. 9, 14 and 20, illustrating trees found in 

 dry rocky situations, will show that the statements made above are 

 almost axiomatic. 



That climate influences the cell growth of palms is illustrated by a 

 specimen in the botanical laboratory of the University of Pennsylva- 

 nia, presented by S. L. Schumo. It is a section of stem of a Sabal 

 palmetto which grew at Daytona, Florida. The cross section shows 

 evidence of two rings of growth outside of the main, uniformly-con- 

 structed cylinder of bundles and parenchymatous tissue. The de- 

 scription accompanying the specimen states that the tree from which 

 the section was made shed its leaves in a manner similar to the horse- 

 chestnut, so that the petiole was left attached to the main stem. The 

 statement also is made that the natives claim that the petioles, which 

 they call bootjacks, all fall off and then the trunk becomes bare 

 when this tree becomes mature. It is evident, therefore, that the 

 recm-rent fall of leaves from this tree, just as in typical dicotyledonous 

 stems with concentric annual rings of wood, has produced the corres- 

 ponding stem structure just described — that is the appearance of two 

 well-marked rings, external to the central uniform stem cylinder. 



The secondary growth in thickness which we have described for 

 the Bermuda palmetto, where the stem is alternately enlarged and 

 contracted producing the hour-glass forms, is different from the sec- 

 ondary growth in thickness displayed by Sabal palmetto in Florida. 

 However, the fact that palms do show secondary growth in thickness 

 renders these examples absolutely unique, as far as the information of 

 the writer goes. 



Another fact of somewhat similar import may be mentioned, namely, 

 that the stems of the coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, as seen by the 

 writer in Jamaica, and of the Bermuda palmetto, Sabal Blackburniana, 




704 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct. 



as seen by him in Bermuda in June, 1905, contrary to the usual behef that 

 old stems with permanent tissue cannot alter the position of such tissue, 

 will make secondary growth curvatures and will grow again into upright 

 position after they have been blown prostrate to the ground by hur- 

 ricanes, as illustrated in fig. 17, a drawing of a tree found along the 

 shores of Harrington Sound near Devil's Hole, Bermuda. 



The figures sufficiently display the peculiarities of the stem of the 

 Bermuda palmetto, so that a description of each figure is superfluous. 

 It may be said, however, that figs. 1-8 inclusive represent trees 

 growing along the north shore of the main island in front of a golf 

 clubhouse. Fig. 9 pictures a tree found in extremely dry situations. 

 Fig. 14 is that of a tree in a rocky abandoned quarry. Fig. 15 depicts 

 a tree at the edge of a field along the north shore road ; fig. 22, a tree 

 in Pembroke Marsh, and fig. 18, a palmetto in rich soil along the 

 edge of this marsh, while fig. 20 pictures the trunk of a tree on the 

 dry cliffs along St. George Harbor. The other figures are drawings 

 of trees, which grew in other parts of the Bermuda archipelago.

A number of new forms chiefly collected by Mr. Nakacla in Kyushu 

 and the Ryukyu chain last winter are herein described. In work- 

 ing up these islands many hardships and dangers were encountered, 

 not the least being the abundance of venomous snakes locally called 

 "Hahu." The malacological results have been most gratifying, as we

Shell similar to D. tokunoshimana except that the whorls of the con- 

 ical portion of the spire, and the back of the penultimate whorl are sculp- 

 tm^ed with widely spaced threads. On the front of the penultimate and 

 on the last whorl the thread-strise are much closer, though neither so 

 close or so fine as in tokunoshimana. 



Tamina, Kunchan, Ryukyu. Types No. 89,955, A. N. S. Phila., 

 from No. 1349 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



In D. tokunoshimana and D. t. errans the spout or sinus at the foot 

 of the columella is developed more strongly than in D. paxillus Gredler, 

 of China ; the columella is straighter, and the mouth is more irregular 

 in shape, not approaching circular as in paxillus, the columellar margin 

 being vertical and straight. The Formosan D. hungerfordiana has a 

 much shorter cone than tokunoshimana. 



Diplommatina tosana kureana n. subsp. 



Differs from D. tosana by the longer, straightly conic upper half of 

 the shell, which tapers regularly from the penultimate whorl, while in 

 D. tosana the next earlier whorl is larger, and the spire convexly conic. 

 There is also nearly a whorl more, almost 7 in kureana, and the columel- 

 lar margin of the aperture is more straightened. The constriction is 

 above or barely behind the outer lip, as in tosana; the palatal plica is 

 long, covered by the parietal callus, and the columellar lamella strong 

 and horizontal.

 whorl smaller, with the striae more oblique and more distant than on 

 the penultimate, well rounded, the sutiu-e slowly ascending to the lip. 

 Constriction median above the aperture; the palatal plica is long, lying 

 chiefly in front of the parietal callus. Peristome well expanded, with 

 a narrow "collar" close behind it. Parietal callus small, with dis- 

 tinctly raised edge. Columellar lamella strong.

Nogawa, Tosa. Types No. 89,962, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,026& 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



The special features of this form may entitle it to specific rank, but 

 for the present its relationship to D. tosana may be kept in view by 

 the use of a trinomial designation. 



Falaina (Adelopoma) paucioostata n. sp. 



Shell sinistral, perforate, cylindric-conic, white or pale yellow, thin, 

 sculptured with delicate widely spaced thread-like riblets, about 20 

 on the last whorl. Wliorls 5^, very convex, the earlier ones rapidly 

 increasing, the last two about equal. Last whorl well rounded periph- 

 erally and basally, having a weak, inconspicuous constriction above the 

 columella. Aperture nearly circular with continuous peristome, not 

 dilated on the parietal wall. Peristome reflexed, with an inner rim; 

 columellar tooth small and deeply situated.

This species is larger than P. pusilla {Diplommatina pusilla Martens) 

 or its variety omiensis Pils., with much more widely-spaced riblets. 



TRUNOATELLID^. 

 Trunoatella japonica n. sp. 



Shell of the usual cylindric, truncate shape, 3^ whorls remaining; of 

 a light reddish color. Sculpture of nearly straight rounded ribs about 

 as wide as their intervals, 28 or 30 on the last whorl. There is usually 

 a small crest behind the lip, which is narrowly expanded. Aperture 

 ovate. 



Length 5.8., diam. 2.3 mm.

Futami, Ise. Types No. 89,942, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,319 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species is related to T. kiusiuensis, from which it differs in the 

 smaller size, smaller and more numerous ribs, there being about 30 on 

 the last whorl, while T. kiusiuensis has about 20; and the rib behind 

 the lip is not so large. T. pfeifferi Marts., described from Japan- with- 

 out more exact locality, is larger and more robust, 6x3 mm,, and is 

 sculptured "with nearly straight riblets equal to their intervals, and 

 evanescent on the last whorl." It has not been figured, and was col- 

 lected by Siebold, Mr. Hirase has found no Truncatella agreeing 

 with the characters quoted. The province Ise is on tlie East coast of 

 the main island. The locality is far north for a Truncatella.

HELIOID^. 

 Eulota mercatoria iejimana n. subsp. 



Shell narrowly umbilicate, solid, compact, rich chestnut, paler near 

 the suture and umbilicus, and with a chocolate-brown band at the peri- 

 phery, with a whitish band above and below it. Surface somewhat 

 shining, rib striate above, nearly smooth below. Spire convexly-conoid. 

 Whorls about 6, convex, very slowly widening, the last rounded peri- 

 pherally, very slightly descending in front; base convex. Aperture 

 oblique, lunate. Peristome flesh-tinted or whitish, well reflexed, 

 thickened within, arcuate throughout; in a basal view the basal mar- 

 gin is slightly arched forward.

lejima, Ryukyu. Types No. 89,902, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,352 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This peculiar little form differs from Eulota mercatoria by its more 

 globose shape, more closely coiled whorls, wider peristome, etc. It re- 

 sembles also E. caliginosa, but the base is more convex and the basal 

 lip is arcuate. It might be considered a distinct species. 



Eulota connivens iheyaensis n. subsp. 



Shell differing from E. c. phasogramma by its strong thread-like rib- 

 striae both above and below. 



Alt. 16, diam. 22 mm.

Eulota (Plectotropis) tokunovaga n. sp. 



Shell openly umbilicate, shaped much like E. mackensii, being low- 

 conic above, convex beneath; thin and light, almost fragile; chestnut 

 colored or sometimes pale dull green. Surface lusterless, irregularly 

 marked with growth lines, and where unrubbed, bearing sparse linear 

 ftdnate cuticular threads; peripheral fringe rather short and sparse 

 in young shells, generally absent in adults. Under the dull outer coat 

 the surface is closely striate spirally, both above and below. Whorls 

 6^ to 6f, slightly convex, the last not descending in front, strongly 

 carinate peripherally, convex beneath. Aperture oblique, trape- 

 zoidal. Peristome thin, narrowly expanded, the basal and columellar 

 margins narrowly reflexed. Parietal callus very thin.

Tokunoshima, Osumi. Types No. 87,501, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 

 1,211 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species, while related to E. mackensii. is smaller and much more 

 delicate, almost to be called fragile. The cuticular processes are 

 shorter; the surface when rubbed is seen to be closely and distinctly 

 striate spirally, and the base is not so angular around the umbilicus. 

 It is a much thinner, weaker shell than E. vulgivaga. 



The Ganesella largillierti group consists of richly colored and beauti- 

 ful snails, confined, so far as we know, to the Oshima and Okinawa 

 groups — the central islands of the Ryukyu chain. The following forms 

 may be recognized: 



I. — Surface with extremely weak spiral striae or none, 



G. largillierti C'Phil." Pfr.). 

 II. — Spiral striation minute but distinct.

Ganesella sororcula okinoerabuensis n. subsp. 



Narrowly umbilicate, broad and low-conic, light yellow with a broad 

 purplish-brown band immediately above and another a short dis- 

 tance below the periphery. Spire bicolored, the lower half of the pe- 

 nultimate whorl purple-brown, the upper half yellow; on the next 

 earlier whorl purple replaces the yellow ; and the upper two whorls are 

 dark purple-brown. The surface is finely striate spirally.

Ganesella sororcula iheyaensis n. subsp. 



Shell globose-trochiform, minutely obliquely perforate, pale yellow- 

 ish (or white when denuded of the thin cuticle) with three red-brown 

 bands, one at the periphery, one above and one below it, the latter some- 

 times concrescent with the peripheral ; there is also a dark subsutural

Moellendorffia eucharistus (Pils.). 



Originally described as a Chloritis, but the cord across the parietal 

 wall, the shape of the aperture, and the vestigial sulci behind the lip 

 in some specimens, show that the species belongs to the subgenus 

 Trihelix of the genus Moellendorffia. 



Moellendorffia eucharistus tokunoensis n. subsp. 



Shell larger than eucharistus, the spire and last whorl wider, whorls 

 less convex above; color darker, chocolate brown. Wliorls 4|, the 

 first very glossy and smooth.

 Moellendorffia eucharistus diminuta n. subsp. 



Shell smaller than eucharistus, with more deeply sunken and nar- 

 rower spire; whorls 4^^, more convex above than in eucharistus. There 

 is a slight indentation or flattening above the periphery^behind the aper-

ZONITID^. 



The Zonitidce of the Ogasawara or Bonin Islands, exclusive of Hi- 

 rasea and related forms, may be determined by the following key. The 

 generic relations of part of the forms are uncertain, since we as yet 

 know little of the extent to which convergent evolution has moulded 

 shell-form in this family.

Microcystina hahajimana Pils. 



This species was described in 1902 from specimens from Hahajima 

 Ogasawara, the types being 82,606, A. N. S. Phila., No. 803 of Mr. 

 Hirase's collection. It seems to be a typical Microcystina, having a 

 calloused, obtusely nodular columella, and a glossy surface which is 

 not spirally engraved. Numerous closely related forms have subse- 

 quently been received from various islands, as follows: 




712 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct.,

 Hirase's collection. 



Similar specimens, but with the spire a little higher, more like typical 

 M. hahajimana, were taken on Nakanoshima (S03c of Mr. Hirase's 

 collection), the largest measuring alt. 3.3, diam. 5.2 mm. The spire 

 is about as high as in typical hahajimana. Others came from Anijima

the same form was sent from Nakanojima. It differs from Macro- 

 chlamys lineata by the smooth surface, without spiral striation. 



Macrochlamys lineatus n. sp. 



Shell narrowly umbilicate, depressed, convex above and below, thin, 

 amber colored, glossy; closely and rather deeply striate spirally above

 carinate at the periphery; thin, brown, not glossy, but with a dull 

 silken luster. Sculpture of irregular growth-wrinkles and a very fine, 

 close irregular granulation. Spire low-conic, with convex outlines 

 and an obtuse apex. Whorls 4f, but slightly convex, the last two 

 with a shallow furrow above the keel. Base convex, impressed at the

Shell similar to K. crenulata but larger, with the base radially thread- 

 striate like the upper surface. 



Alt. 4.2, diam. 4 mm., whorls 7. 



Alt. 3.7, diam. 3.3 mm., whorls 6^. 



Yakushima, Osumi. Types No. 87,934, A. N. S. Phila., from No.

In K. crenulata the base is smooth, and that species has not been 

 found in Kyushu or southward up to this time. 



ENDODONTID^. 

 Punctum boreale n. sp. 



Shell depressed, umbilicate, dark brown, thin, dull; whorls 3^, the 

 first li smooth, the rest with oblique, coarse, widely, irregularly spaced 

 wrinkle-like ribs, the intervals and ribs finely striate spirally. Whorls 

 convex, the last rounded peripherally and below. Umbilicus some-

what smaller than the aperture. Aperture olDlique, rounded, about 

 one-fourth of the circle excised at the parietal margin. 



Alt. 1, diam. 2.1 mm.; width of umbilicus 0.6, of aperture 1 mm. 



Akkeshi, Kushiro. Types No. 90,230 A. N. S. Phila. from No. 1,309 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species differs from P. amblygona Reinh. by its rounded per- 

 iphery. It is also related to the southern P. rota. 



PUPILLID^. 



Vertigo Mrasei kushiroensis n. subsp. 



Differs from V. hirasei Pils. by being larger, more solid, brown, with 

 a strong pale ridge or crest a short distance behind the outer lip. It 

 is not as wide and swollen as V. h. hachijoensis. The typical four teeth 

 are developed. 



Length 1.8, diam. 1 mm. 



Akkeshi, Kushiro. Types No. 90,223, A. N. S. Phila.. from No. 1,310 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Vertigo hirasei in some of its varieties will probably be found through- 

 out Japan, since the type came from Kyushu, while the form described 

 above is from northern Yesso, and another subspecies occurs in the 

 islands of Izu. 



ACHATINELLID^. 



Tornatellina rucuana n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, ovate-conic, thin, pale brown, lightl}^ striatulate, 

 glossy. Spire conic; whorls 4^, convex. Aperture oblique, ovate. 

 Outer lip thin and simple. Columella convex and somewhat callous 

 above; parietal lamella well developed, long. 



Alt. 3.3, diam. 1.9 mm. 



Kerama-jima, Ryukyu. Types No. 89,891, A. N. S. Phila., from No, 

 1,360 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This is a wider shell than T. triplicata, and the 3^oung do not have 

 internal varices or a triplicate columella. It is the first imperforate 

 Tornatellina found in the Ryukyu Islands. 



AURICULID^. 



Cassidula labrella japonica n. subsp. 



Shell imperforate, oval wdth conic spire, solid, dark brown. The 

 whorls of the spire have a groove defining a rather wide subsutural 

 border, and rarely several weak spirals below it. The last whorl is 

 very finely striate spirally, the most strongly sculptured specimens 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 719 



with some deeper, punctate strise among the others; all the strioe being 

 very weak or even obsolete. Whorls 7^ to 8, nearly flat. Some in- 

 conspicuous, slightly paler variceal streaks are visible on the spire. The 

 last whorl has a narrow and often very low crest close behind the outer 

 lip, and the usual keel or cord at the base, defining a small umbilical 

 area. Aperture including peristome seven-twelfths the length of the 

 shell, regularly ovate, slightly oblique. Peristome nearly white; outer 

 lip with a strong internal callus, excised above as usual, and either even- 

 edged or weakly two-toothed near the upper end. Inner lip with three 

 folds, the lower two entering, not emerging to the lip-edge, the upper 

 parietal fold small and tubercular, not longitudinal, sometimes wanting. 



Length 13, diam. 7.3 mm., length aperture 8 mm. 



Length 12, diam. 6.9 mm., length apertm-e 7.4 mm. 



Nishigo, Uzen. Types No. 78,767, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 407 of 

 Mr. Hirase's marine shell collection. 



C. labrella, described from the Isle of France, is a more strongly stri- 

 ate shell with larger aperture. The present form is almost smooth, 

 the striae scarcely being discernible in most specimens. C. plecotrema- 

 toides Mlldff. is more strongly striate, with the upper parietal tooth 

 and the two on the lip-callus better developed. 



I am disposed to consider both the Japanese form descril^ed above 

 and the Chinese C. plecotrematoides as subspecies of C. labrella ; but if the 

 Chinese form be separated specifically, then C. I. japonica will be referred 

 to it as a subspecies. 

 Cassidula paludosa nigrobrunnea n. subsp. 



Similar to C. paludosa Garrett, but the parietal denticle is better de- 

 veloped than usual in that species; the color is deep chocolate brown, 

 with a blackish line below the suture. 



Length 10, diam. 6 mm. ; length of aperture 6.3 mm. 



Length 9, diam. 5.2 mm. 



Length 7.2, diam. 5 mm. 



Kunchan, Ryukyu. Types No. 89,973, A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,345 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This little Cassidula has the egg-like shape and high lip-crest of the 

 Vitian C. paludosa, of which the types are before me; but that is, so 

 far as known, invariably yellow or light brown in color.

CATALOGUE OF THE LAND AND FRESH-WATER MOLLTJSCA OF TAIWAN 

 (FORMOSA), WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES. 



BY HENRY A. PILSBRY AND Y. HIRASE. 



Early in the present year Mr. Okiira, collecting for Mr. Hirase, pro- 

 ceeded to Taiwan (Formosa), with instructions to confine his attention 

 chiefly to collecting land shells. He succeeded in getting a large num- 

 ber of species, but many of them only in small quantity, so that the 

 expedition, while laborious and expensive, was hardly productive of 

 so large a supply of specimens as anticipated. The number of species 

 taken (71) was, however, greater than any previous naturalist has ob- 

 tained, and adds largely to our knowledge of the distribution of known 

 species, besides augmenting the total number of land snails known 

 by the discovery of some 27 new species and 13 subspecies. 



The number of species taken is so considerable that it has been 

 thought useful to add the names of all previously known Formosan 

 snails, making the list complete for the island. 



Our first knowledge of Formosan land and fresh-water shells was from 

 specimens collected by H. B. M. Vice-Consul Robert Swinhoe, who, 

 though chiefly interested in the higher Vertebrates, accomplished a 

 vast amount of work on invertebrate groups as well. His first sending 

 of land shells to Hugh Cuming, in London, was worked up by Dr. Pfeif- 

 fer,^ the marine and fresh-water forms being identified by H. Adams 

 and Cuming himself, and the list published by Frazer.^ Subsequent 

 sendings were described by Henry Adams. ^ 



Few if any additions were made to the list of land snails until the

 lection of the late Hugh Cuming, collected bv Mr. Robert Swinhoe, Vice-Consul 

 of that island. By Dr. Louis Pfeiffer. P. Z. &., 1865, pp. 828-831, pi. 46. 



No localities are given for the species described in this paper, but we know from 

 a letter from Swinhoe published in P. Z. S., for 1864 that these shells were chiefly 

 from Tamsui in northern Formosa, a few from Takow in the south.

end of the next decade, when Surgeon-General R. Hungerford, Ritter 

 von Fries and a few other naturahsts visited the island. Their col- 

 lections were worked up chiefly by Dr. O. von Mollendorff, who pub- 

 lished the results in his enlightening series of papers upon the Chinese 

 snail fauna.* Meantime the Melaniidce collected by IMr. Dickson had 

 been described by Mr. E. A. Smith .^ After von Mollendorff 's depar- 

 ture for Manila the field was left to Mr. B. Schmacker, then of Hong- 

 kong, whose material was obtained in part from several German friends 

 who travelled in Formosa, but largely by his Japanese collector who 

 spent over three months there in the latter part of 1889. The materials 

 gathered were ably worked up by Schmacker and Boettger.^ From 

 1891 until this time, only a few inconsiderable additions have been 

 made to the list of Formosan mollusks. The data for the principal 

 papers may be tabulated thus:

 Cyclophorus turgidus Pfr. 



Hotawa (Hirase). Has also been reported by E. A. Smith from 

 Formosa, without exact locaUt}^, P. Z. S., 1887, p. 318. The specimens 

 taken by Mr. Okura are quite typical. It is a common Ryukyuan 

 species.

Keelung and Takohan (Hungerford). Suganiikei (Hirase). This 

 is probably to be regarded as a variety of C. turgidus. The specimens 

 taken by Mr. Okura are not quite elevated enough to be typical. 



Mr, E. A. Smith incidentally reports C. exaltatus from Formosa (P. 

 Z. S., 1887, 318). It is a well-known Hongkong species, and in view 

 of the excessively critical nature of the species of Cyclophorus of the 

 Sino-insular group, the specimens referred by Smith to exaltatus may 

 belong to C. formosaensis. Some forms given the rank of species in 

 the exaltatus group by von Moellendorff and others are distinguished 

 by only slight and elusive characters.

The handsome coloration and numerous spiral series of hairs are 

 the more conspicous features of this pretty Japonia, of which but two 

 specimens were taken. 

 Japonia formosana n. sp. 



Shell umbilicate, turbinate-conic, with rather slender spire, the out- 

 lines concave. Dark red -brown or rather light olive colored. Sur- 

 face but slightly shining, striatulate, with a number of low, irregularly 

 spaced spiral cords or threads, often in part indistinct, and when fresh 

 with irregularly spaced cuticular lamellae along the lines of growth. 

 There are two or three series of sparse hairs, readily deciduous, on the 

 last whorl. Whorls 5, very convex. Aperture circular, sub vertical, 

 the peristome simple, ends connected by a very short parietal callus. 



Alt. 5, diam. 5 mm. 



Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 90,238 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,407

Only five specimens were taken. The cuticular lamellae and hairs are 

 sometimes entirely lost, perhaps always in old shells. Of the two spec- 

 imens in the type lot, they are developed on the dark red-brown speci- 

 mens which may be regarded as typical, and absent from the pale green- 

 ish one.

Cyclotus minutus concentratus n. subsp. 



Shell reddish-brown or pale olive-green with a brown spire, 

 closely sculptured with fine spiral threads (closer than in C. minutus) 

 on a glossy ground, except for a band below the suture (both on the 

 spire and within the umbilicus), which is covered with narrow whitish 

 cuticular rays. Whorls 3|, tubular, the last barely in contact at the 

 mouth. Umbilicus much smaller than the aperture, and smaller than 

 in C. minutus. Aperture but slightly oblique, circular, the peristome a 

 little expanded, obtuse. Operculum concave, with dark gray central 

 spot and obliquely striate whorls.

1905.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 725 



Giiran, Taiwan. Types No. 89,945 A. X. S. Phila., from No. 1,365a 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



The genus Cyathopoma is not yet .known from China. Its eastern 

 limit has hitherto been the Khasi, Naga and South Garo Hills, where 

 the species are like the Formosan in featm^es of the operculum. It 

 has not been found north of these places, nor eastward in the Dafla Hills, 

 so that its known range heretofore has been sub-Himalayan and south- 

 ward. 



In this and other known Formosan and Japanese Cyathopomas, 

 the shell has no fibrous vertically striated coating, such as is conspic- 

 uous in the Indian C. filocinctum and others. The whorls of the oper- 

 culum have no projecting lamellae. The species belong therefore to 

 the subgenus Jerdonia, as defined by Kobelt (Das Thierrcich, Cyclo- 

 phoriden, p. 219). It is clear, however, that Kobelt ignores the char- 

 acter of the operculum in his distribution of the species of Cyathopoma 

 and Jerdonia. 



C. taiivanicum is not unlike C. album Bedd., but it has more spirals, 

 and they are not so prominent in the umbilicus. 



There is a form of C. taiwanicum from Chosokei which is a little more 

 variable in sculpture than the type lot, sometimes having one or two 

 more spiral threads. 



Cyathopoma taiwanicum degeneratum n. subsp. 



At Suganiikei, Taiwan, five specimens were taken which differ 

 from C. taiwanicum by the degeneration of the spiral threads, which 

 are very weak or even almost wanting on the last whorl. T3'pes are

Cyathopoma micron (Pils.). 



Cyclotus micron Pils., Nautilus, 1900, p. 12. 



Taihoku (Hirase). Also found in the Ryukj'u Islands and Japan. 



Mr. Ancey has proposed a genus Nakadiella for Cyclotus (?) micron; 

 but this species differs from typical forms of Jerdonia in nothing but 

 the absence of spiral striation. There are a number of equalty smooth 

 species in Ceylon. Nakadiella may be retained as a sectional name 

 for the smooth forms, if the distinction proves to be natural; otherwise 

 it will become a synonym of Jerdonia.

Tanisui (Swinhoe); Anshiryosan, Hotawa and Suganiikei (Hirase). 



This species varies a good deal in size and structure of the hp, but 

 Schmacker and Boettger seem to be right in hokling that all the de- 

 scribed Formosan forms are but varying races of one species. The 

 specimens from Hotawa are about typical, length 13 mm. Those from 

 Anshiryosan seem referable to the race tnorrisonia H. Ad., described 

 from Mt. Morrison. They are 10.5-11 mm. long, and have the upper 

 funnel of the lip much smaller than in the type. At Suganiikei there 

 is also a small form of about the same length. 



The var. meridionalis S. and B. is distinguished by smaller size, 

 length 9.5 to 11, width 4^ to 4f mm. It is from Bankimtsong. The 

 type of P. morrisonia is 12 x 5 mm., while the size of typical P. swinhoei 

 is given as 14 x 5.5 mm.

Keelung (Hungerford) = Kiirun (Hirase). Dr. von Moellendorff 

 considered this a variety of the Chinese D. paxillus Gredler; but its 

 differential features seem constant, 



Diplommatina taiwanica n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, the lower half cylindric, upper half conic, light 

 orange colored, darker toward the apex. Whorls 6^, the first 4+ reg- 

 ularly increasing, the next whorl larger, swollen, the last whorl much 

 smaller, especially as seen in a dorsal view. First H whorls smooth, 

 the next 3^ sculptured with delicate thread-like riblets which become a 

 little closer on the front of the swoUen penultimate whorl, and then 

 become more or less obsolete, so that the last whorl or whorl and a 

 half are nearly or quite smooth. Constriction median above the aper- 

 ture. Palatal plica short, partly under the parietal callus. Aperture 

 vertical, irregularly rounded, the columellar margin straightened. 

 Peristome well expanded and somewhat thickened, angular at the 

 junction of the columellar and basal margins; parietal callus rather 

 small, its border usually indistinct. Columellar tooth small. 



Length 2.9, diam. 1.5 mm. 



Giiran. Taiwan. Types No. 89,965 A. N. S. Phila., from Xo. 1,3646 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



In D. hungerjordiana the cone of the spire is shorter. Another set 




1905.] NATURAL SCIEiSrCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 727 



of specimens from Giiran differs in having the last two whorls striate 

 throughout, the strise closer than on the conical upper portion of the 

 spire. This may be only individual variation. Eleven of the entirely 

 striate and fifteen of the typical specimens were taken. 



Siplommatina taiwanica suganiikeiensis n. subsp. 



Shell brownish corneous, more obese than D. taiwanica; last whorl 

 more ascending to the aperture, and more deeply constricted ; striation 

 finer and nearly even throughout, very weak; palatal plica very short; 

 basal angle more projecting. 



Length 3, diam. 1.7 mm., whorls 5^. 



Suganiikei, Taiwan. Types No. 89,966 A. X. S. Phila., from No. 

 1,364c of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This form seems rather unlike D. taiwanica, and unless intermediate 

 specimens are found it will probably rank as a distinct species. Only 

 nine individuals were taken. 

 Diplommatina camara n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, cylindric below, conic above, pale orange or brown- 

 ish-yellow. Whorls 6, the first 4 regularly increasing, the next whorl 

 swollen, the last much smaller, especially as seen dorsally. First H whorls 

 smooth; following whorls of the cone sculptured with widely spaced 

 thread-like riblets, penultimate whorl with the riblets much closer, 

 last whorl smooth. Constriction rather deep, median above the mouth . 

 Palatal plica very weak and short. Aperture vertical, irregularly 

 rounded. Parietal callus moderate, with distinct edge. Peristome 

 well expanded, thickened within, wide, projecting at the junction 

 of the columellar and basal margins. Columellar lamella moderately 

 prominent, very short inside. 



Length 3, diam. 1.6 mm. 



Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 90,243 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,424 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



This species differs from D. taiwanica, chiefly by its very small pala- 

 tal plica and the very short columellar lamella, which in taiwanica 

 ascends to the constriction. D. tokunoshimana differs from camura 

 in sculpture and the well-developed palatal plica. 

 Diplommatina prava n. sp. 



Shell cylindric below, conic above, imperforate, pale yellowish corn- 

 eous, the upper whorls often orange tinted. Whorls 6|, regularly

like strise. Constriction distinct, situated near or at the end of the 

 penultimate whorl, behind the lip. Aperture irregularly rounded, 

 the columellar side straight. Parietal callus small. Peristome ex- 

 panded and thickened or duplicated, the outer lip, in profile, seen to be 

 a little retracted or concave in the middle, projecting in a blunt point a 

 short distance from the upper insertion ; an angle outside at the junction 

 of the columellar and basal margins.

Smaller than any other known Formosan Diplommatina, and readily 

 distinguished by the retrogradeconstriction, sinuous outer lip, etc. It 

 resembles D. luchvana somewhat, but differs in the position of the 

 constriction, stronger basal angle, less distinct parietal callus, etc. It 

 occurred in some numbers {pravus, deformed). 



Slightly smaller specimens were taken at Suganiikei. At Hotawa 

 the sculpture is better developed. 



Falaina formosana n. sp. 



Shell sinistral, minute, pupiform, imperforate, yellow or pale brown- 

 ish-yellow, sculptured with delicate, distant, thread-like very oblique 

 riblets, about 7 in number on the last whorl, absent on the front of this 

 whorl, and verj^ weak on the penultimate whorl. Whorls 5, convex, 

 the first three regularly and rapidly increasing, the penultimate very 

 much swollen, predominating, the last whorl smaller, rapidly tapering to 

 the base, slightly constricted immediately above the aperture. Suture 

 well impressed , quite oblique. Aperture rounded , the peristome yellow, 

 narrowly expanded, doubled in old shells; the margins continued in a 

 callus with raised edge, spreading up above the aperture nearly to the 

 preceding suture. Columellar tooth small, deepl}' placed.

Eulota lautsi micra n. subsp. 



General shape of E. lautsi. Pale brownish-corneous, unicolored or 

 with a red-brown band on the acute peripheral keel. Smooth, showing 

 faint striation under a lens, with nearly effaced scarcely visible spiral 

 strisB on the dull upper surface, densely striate spirally on the base. 

 Whorls fully six. Outer and basal margins of the peristome expanded, 

 subreflexed ; columellar margin very steeply ascending, dilated above. 



Alt. 5.7, diam. 9.8 mm. ; width of aperture 4.8. of umbilicus 1.8 mm. 



Tapanii, Taiwan. Types No. 89,875 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,428 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Compared with typical lautsi, this form differs in the small size, 

 wider mouth as seen in front view, and narrower last whorl as seen 

 from above, and it wants a white edge on the keel. A small form of 

 lautsi has been recorded by Schmacker and Boettger from Takao. 



The subordination of lautsi to H. shermani Pfr. in Schmacker and 

 Boettger's second discussion of it was apparently an error, H. shermani 

 being a Trocliomorpha. 



Eulota (Plectotropis) inrinensis n. sp. 



The shell is depressed-trochiform, thin, umbilicate, the umbilicus 

 narrow, less than one-fifth the diameter of the shell, rapidly contract- 

 ing within; pale brownish-corneous, lusterless, lightly striatulate, and 

 finely striate spirally, the spirals very delicate, scarcely visible above, 

 more distinct below. Spire low-conic, with nearly straight outlines. 

 Whorls 5j to 5^, somewhat convex, the last acutely carinate at the 

 periphery, convex below, slightly descending in front. Aperture quite 

 oblique. Peristome thin, narrowly expanded, the basal margin deeply 

 arcuate, reflexed. columellar margin dilated above.

Inrin, Taiwan. Types No. 89,872 A. N. S. Phila., from No.l, 393 of 

 Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Only four specimens of this little Plectotropis were taken. It is 

 closely related to E. lautsi micra, yet differs by the more diminutive 

 size, narrower umbilicus, less dilated columellar lip and paler color. 

 It is decidedly more depressed than E. hehes. 



Eulota (Plectotropis) hebes n. sp. 



Shell trochiform, very thin, umbilicate, pale brown, but slightly 

 shining, weakly striatulate, and showing very fine, weak spiral striae 

 beneath. Spire conic, the apex obtuse. "V\Tiorls 5^, convex, the last 

 strongly carinate at the periphery, the keel projecting but blunt at the

 Suture well impressed. Aperture oblique, broadly lunate, the peris- 

 tome thin, narrowly expanded, the columellar margin dilated above; 

 basal margin deeply arcuate.

Suganiikei, Taiwan. Type No. 90,047 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,390 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Very rare, as only two fully adult shells were found. With as many 

 whorls as E. inrinensis, this species is smaller, more elevated, with a nar- 

 rower umbilicus and a more deeply arcuate basal lip. It has much 

 the shape of the far larger E. fulvicans (H. Ad.). 



Enlota (Pleototropis) perplexa n. sp. 



Shell trochoidal, thin, rather openly umbilicate, the umbilicus about 

 one-fourth the diameter of the shell, rapidly contracting inward. Sur- 

 face dull, covered with a brown cuticle, sculptured with minute closely 

 placed, short, linear, raised processes above the periphery, with an 

 under-sculpture of indistinct fine spiral lines; below the periphery it 

 is very closely engraved with fine spiral lines. The spire is conic, with 

 straight lateral outlines. Whorls 6^, slowly increasing, but slightly con- 

 vex, the last with a slightly projecting, acute keel at the peripher}^ 

 descending slightly below the keel to the aperture. Suture well im- 

 pressed, following the lower edge of the keel. Aperture oblique, per- 

 istome thin, the basal and outer margins narrowly reflexed, arcuate, 

 the upper margin but slightly arcuate, hardly expanded, columellar 

 margin nearly vertical, arcuate, dilated above; parietal callus very 

 thin. 



Alt. 8.2, diam. 12 mm.; diam. of apertiu-e 5.3 mm.; of umbilicus 

 nearly 3 mm.

The shells from Hotawa, Taiwan, are obese, with the strise irregularly 

 crimped, the intervals^ finely wrinkled across as in C. formosensis, but 

 the color is dark purplish-brown as in swinhoei. Those from Kiirun 

 and Suganiikei taper more and have finer nearly straight stria? without 

 interstitial sculpture, and are clearly the true C. swinhoei. 



There is a variety subformosensis Nevill mentioned by Schmacker

 Trochomorpha pellucida n. sp. 



Shell umbilicate, the diameter of umbilicus contained about four 

 and one-half times in that of the shell, conic-depressed, acutely cari- 

 nate, thin, pale brownish-corneous, quite translucent. Surface glossy, 

 finely striatulate with some very indistinct traces of spiral lines. Spire 

 low-conic with straight sides. Whorls 6^, the earlier ones convex and 

 slowly increasing, the last two more rapidly widening, convex below the 

 suture, then concave. Last whorl concave above and below the aftute 

 peripheral keel, convex beneath, rather suddenly passing into the 

 umbilicus, but not angular around it. The aperture is somewhat 

 oblique, with thin, acute peristome; the basal margin is rather deeply 

 arched, columellar margin steep and arcuate, upper margin short and 

 nearly straight.

Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 89,879 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,405 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



Only two specimens of this delicate little Trochomorpha were taken. 

 It is closely related to T. haenseli S. and B., but is less depressed, the 

 umbilicus smaller, the aperture larger, with basal lip much more deeply 

 arcuate. The width of the aperture is contained in that of the shell 

 2.3 times in T. pelhicida, about 2.7 times in T. haenseli. 

 Trochomorpha oultrata formosana n. subsp. 



Similar to T. cuUrata in general shape and color, but rery distinctly, 

 finely and evenly granulose above and below. Whorls 6^, the first two 

 convex, the rest almost flat above; base excavated below the very 

 acute keel, then quite convex, with a strong angle, almost a keel, around 

 the umbilicvis, which is a trifle wider than in T. cuUrata. Basal lip 

 strongly sinuous, being well retracted midivay between the pcriphercU 

 and basal keels. 



Alt. 7, diam. 19.3 mm.; diam. umbilicus, measured from the keel, 

 8 mm. 



Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 89,939 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,399

Twenty specimens of this fine Trochomorpha were taken. Wliile 

 evidently related to T. cultrata of the Ryukyu Islands, it may eventu- 

 ally be given specific rank.

 Macrochlamys nitidus n. sp. 



Shell minutely perforate, depressed, pale yellow, subtransparent, 

 gloss}^ and smooth, under a strong lens showing excessively fine spiral 

 striae below the suture and around the umbilicus; the parietal callus 

 very thin, minutely granulose. Spire very low-conic. Whorls 4|,

periphery; thill, amber-tinted, somewhat transparent and brilliantly 

 glossy below, opaque above, with the luster of a dull silk, the opaque 

 appearance resulting from a sculpture of excessively fine and close ver- 

 tical or radial striae which extends over the periphery and forms a band 

 at the circumference of the base around the glossy basal area, which un- 

 der a strong lens shows fine, well-spaced spiral lines. Whorls 4, convex, 

 the suture well impressed. Aperture lunate, the columellar margin 

 not perceptibly thickened, triangularly reflex ed at the insertion. 



Alt. 1.9, diam. 2.7 mm. 



Giiran, Taiwan. Types No. 89.869 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,368 

 of Mr. Hirase's collection. 



The dull silky surface is like that of some species of Euconulus, 

 Guppya, etc. Only four specimens were taken. The non-callous 

 columella may cause the removal of this species from Microcystina, yet 

 the number of whorls is so small that we would hardly consider it a 

 Kaliella. There are traces of spiral sculpture on the first whorl. 



Microcystina lissobasis n. sp. 



Shell minutely perforate, depressed, with low-conoid spire and con- 

 vex base; thin and fragile, pale yellow, subtransparent. Upper sur- 

 face and a zone at and below the periphery having a silky luster, the 

 rest of the base smooth and glossy. "Wlioiis 4, convex, separated b}' 

 an impressed suture, the periphery rounded. Aperture wideh' lunate, 

 columella oblique, slightly thickened within, its edge a little dilated.

This species is related to M. lamprobasis, having the same silky upper 

 surface and glossy base. It differs by its smaller size and much wider 

 aperture. About 20 specimens^were taken. 

 Microcystina radiata n. sp. 



Shell minutely perforate, depressed, thin, yellowish-corneous, sub- 

 transparent, very glossy. Sculpture of fine, close and minute radial 

 strife and grooves above, the base smooth. Spire low-conoid, the apex 

 obtuse. Whorls 4^, moderately convex, slowl}" increasing, the last

 Kaliella costata n. f^p. 



Shell minutely perforate, acutely carinate, the spire conic, base con- 

 vex; thin, amber-colored, translucent: upper surface sculptured with 

 strong ribs, nearly straight and slightly oblique, the glossy smooth in- 

 tervals three or four times the width of the ribs ; first two whorls smooth ; 

 base convex, smooth and glossy. Spire straightly conic ; whorls 5 j, con-

Alt. 3, diam. 3.5 mm, 



Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 89,977 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,410

This is the most strongly sculptured Kaliella known to us. It is 

 related to K. costulata Godwin-Austen, from the North Cachar Hills, 

 8,000 feet elevation {Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of India, p. 7, pi. 2, 

 fig. 5), but in K. costata the base is smooth, the whorls much more con- 

 vex; and while slightly larger than its Indian relative (which meas- 

 ures alt, 2.8, diam. 3.3 mm.), the Formosan shell has fewer whorls, 5^ 

 instead of 6. 



Kaliella crenulata hotawana n. subsp.

Kaliella venusta n. sp. 



Shell very minutely perforate, conic with semiglobose base, thin, 

 reddish-brown. The surface has the luster of silk, produced by exces- 

 sively fine, close vertical striae, which covers the upper surface and ex- 

 tend over the periphery nearly half way to the center of the base, the

middle region of the base being smooth and glossy. Spire straightly conic, 

 the apex obtuse. Whorls 5^, very convex, parted by a deep suture. 

 Last ivhorl almost rounded at the periphery, there being the sHghtest 

 indication of an obtuse angle; convex beneath, narrowly and rather 

 deeply impressed around the perforation. Aperture semilunar, the 

 columellar margin sub vertical, suddenly dilated above. 



Alt. 2.9, diam. 3.1 mm.

The convex whorls, rounded periphery and silken surface with a 

 smooth^basal area, are the more prominent features of this little snail. 

 Kaliella longa n. sp. 



The shell is imperforate, cupola-shaped, much elevated, the diameter 

 only two-thirds the height, amber-colored, subtransparent and very 

 thin. Surface glossy. The very high spire has convex outlines and a 

 very obtuse apex. WTiorls 7h, the earlier ones quite convex, the later 

 whorls less so ; last whorl with a delicate, acute, thread-like peripheral 

 keel, the base convex, impressed around the axis. Aperture semi- 

 circular, small, the columellar margin reflexed above.

Compared with K. prcealta and its varieties izushichitoensis and xen- 

 ica this species has more convex sides and a more obtuse apex. It is 

 nearer in shape to K. elongata Godwin-Austen {Land and Fresh-water 

 Mollusca of India, p. 9, pi. 2, fig. 9), but that has more whorls, a more 

 acute apex and is larger, being 5 mm. high, 3.3 wide.

Sitala hirasei Pilsbry, n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, acutely carinate, conic above, convex below the 

 carina, excessively thin, fragile, amber-colored, somewhat transparent. 

 Surface somewhat shining, roughened with rather coarse but low 

 oblique ripples or wrinkles in places, and showing extremely fine spiral 

 stride ; on the apical two whorls these striae are delicate raised threads ; 

 on the later whorls and base they appear as lines of minute, close, reg- 

 ular punctures. Immediately around the axis the puncture lines give 

 way to fine smooth spiral striae. Spire straightly conic; whorls 4^,

slightly convex, rapidly increasing. Aperture rather large, the thin 

 lip acutely angular in the outer part, basal and columellar margins 

 arcuate, the latter delicately refiexed above.

This remarkable Sitala is similar in shape to S. insignis of Japan, 

 but is very much larger. We know of no Chinese or Indian species of 

 like appearance. 

 Sitala angulifera n. sp. 



Shell imperforate, fragile, pale olive-green, subtransparent, acutely 

 carinate in the middle, conic above, convex below the keel. Sculpture 

 of rather coarse oblique wrinkles on the upper surface, the first whorl 

 with numerous low or inconspicuous spiral threads; the other whorls 

 showing some very weak cuticular spirals in a favorable light; base 

 with more widely spaced radial wTinkles, and a few spiral lines below 

 the keel. Spire straightly conic. Whorls 3^, the first one convex, 

 with subobsolete spiral lines, the last whorl nearly fiat above the peri- 

 phery. Aperture large, oblique, the thin peristome angular at the 

 keel, arcuate below; columellar margin narrowly refiexed above.

Alt. 2.3, diam. 2.7 mm. 



Hotawa, Taiwan. Types No. 90,237 A. N. S. Phila., from No. 1,417

The shell is similar to S. hirasei in shape, but decidedly smaller with 

 only 3^ whorls. The rounded apical whorl is nearly smooth, usually 

 without distinct spiral threads, and spirals are almost obsolete on the 

 last whorl. The base is free from spiral striae except for a few fine ones 

 just below the periphery. 



Sitala circumoincta taiwanica n. subsp. 



Shell larger than S. c. data Gude, with stronger spiral threads and 

 more whorls, fully 6. There are 6 or 7 spirals on each whorl. The 

 base is smooth.

This is the largest of the circumcincta series. The IndiSin Sitala con- 

 ulus Blanf . is wider than the Japanese and Formosan forms, with more 

 minute spirals. It is a trifle wider than high, alt 2.9, diam, 3.1 mm.; 

 and while allied, it is doubtless distinct.

 by Sowerby and Henry Adams. The later author presented his paper 

 to the Zoological Society at the meeting of May 22, 1866; and since a 

 colored plate had to be prepared, it could not well have been published 

 for some months later. The descriptions, so far as they go, agree. 

 Sowerby's figure measures, length 65, alt. 40 mm. ; and Adams gives the 

 size as, length 60, alt. 39, diam. 22 mm. Sowerby gives the false locality 

 "Camboja" — a region where Swinhoe never collected; but then the 

 monograph of Unio in the Iconica is famous for false localities. 



Mr. Simpson, in his Synopsis of the Naiades, 1900, p. 586, has quoted 

 this species in the synonymy of "Cristaria swinhoei H. Ad.," which is 

 a totally different species. It may belong to Simpson's genus Lamelli- 

 dens.

Some of the localities explored by Mr. Okura are not to be found on 

 any Occidental map. The location of these places has been indicated 

 on the outline map, p. 751. Mr. Schmacker says that Bagsa (or Baksa) 

 where his Japanese collector worked, is half a degree W.N.W. from 

 Tainan (Tainan-fu or Taiwan-fu), and Bankimtsong is directly east of 

 Takao (Takow), The orthography of Formosan place-names is in a 

 state of transition, owing to the change of ownership of the island 

 and the diverse phonetics of Chinese and Japanese; the older mode 

 being the Chinese, the newer Japanese. Thus, Keelimg of ordinary 

 maps is Kiirun in the Japanese mode. 



The dotted line indicates the approximate border of the western 

 mountainous area, most of which is still practically unknown except 

 to adventurous camphor gatherers, and is inhabited by savage and 

 in part head-hunting tribes.

 of the United States Geological Survey. 



Charles Doolittle Walcott was born in New York Mills, New 

 York, the thirty-first of March, 1850. He was educated in the schools 

 of Utica, New York. On leaving school he entered a large hardware 

 establishment, but after a year and a half decided to pursue geological 

 investigations. He located north of Utica, and for five years studied 

 by himself, and w^orked in the field. In 1876 he received an appoint- 

 ment under Professor James Hall, State Geologist of New York, re- 

 maining there until 1879, when he received an appointment as Field 

 Assistant on the United States Geological Survey. He became suc- 

 cessively Assistant Paleontologist, Chief Paleontologist, Geologist in 

 Charge of Geology, and, July 1, 1894, Director of the Survey. 



He began publishing paleontological papers in 1875, and in 1879 

 published his first geological and paleontological memoir, on the 

 "Utica Slate and Related Formations." Since that time numerous 

 papers on geological and paleontological topics have appeared, the 

 most extended of which are "The Paleontology of the Eureka Dis-

Behavior of Sea Anernones. — Dr. H. S. Jennings gave an account 

 of studies on the behavior of sea anemones, made at the Tortugas 

 Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution. Special attention was given 

 to the modifiability of behavior. The speaker showed that these low 

 organisms by no means always react in the same way to the same 

 external conditions. On the contrary, their reactions are modifiable 

 from a variety of causes. Changes in the internal physiological ])ro- 

 cesses, former stimuli that have affected the animal, former reactions 

 performed by the animal, and a number of other factors, all assist in 

 determining the present action of the organism. There is a clearly 

 marked tendency, in some cases, to repeat an action in the w^ay it has 

 been performed before. These various factors give a high degree of 

 complexity and adaptiveness to the behavior of even these low 

 animals. 



C. H. Smyth, Jr., was elected a member.

1905.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 755 



ON A COLLECTION OF BIRDS FROM BRITISH EAST AFRICA OBTAINED BY 

 MR. GEORGE L. HARRISON, JR. 



BY WITMER STONE. 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has recently 

 received on deposit from Mr. George L. Harrison, Jr., a collection of 

 birds obtained by him on his travels through Central East Africa in 

 1904. Through the courtesy of Mr. Harrison and the Academy I 

 have had the privilege of studying this collection and of preparing a 

 report upon it. 



^^^lile only one of the species represented proves to be new to science, 

 the collection illustrates many interesting points in connection with 

 seasonal and sexual plumages. The specimens are beautifully pre- 

 pared, and this fact, together with the fullness of the data which accom- 

 pany them, renders the collection exceptionally valuable. 



Mr. Harrison has favored me with the following outline of his route : 

 "We left Nairobi on May 16, 1904, and arrived at Fort Hall on May 

 30, spending a few days there. From Fort Hall I took a trip down 

 the Tana river, and should have made a much better collection but 

 for the fact that both Camburn, my taxidermist, and myself suffered 

 very severely with fever, and were laid up for some weeks. I got 

 back to Fort Hall on July 9 and sent Camburn in from there to Nairobi. 

 In the meantime I took a trip and met him at Naivasha on August 24. 

 We then started along the Morandat river to El Bolossa swamp, thence 

 to Pesi swamp and along the Guaso Nyiro, until well north of Mount 

 Kenia. I then sent Camburn back over the Abed are range, which 

 he crossed at an altitude of about 10,500 feet, while I got back to 

 Nairobi on November 4." 



On account of the lack of adequate material for comparison I have, 

 as a rule, made no attempt to indicate subspecific relationship, although 

 a number of forms here recognized certainly intergrade with others 

 whose ranges they adjoin. In the sequence of families and genera I 

 have followed Dr. Bowdler Sharpe's classification.

Sharpe and most authors quote this genus in the emended form 

 Porphijriola from Sundevall, 1872. The original reference, however, 

 is Blyth, Cat. Birds, Mus. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, p. 283. While the genus 

 is not described, a type species, Porphyrio chloronotus [ = alleni] is men- 

 tioned, which is all that is necessary. The date of Blyth's Catalogue 

 on the title-page is 1S49, which is also the year in which the type species 

 was described by him; and from the fact that he leaves the page refer- 

 ence to Jour. Asiat. Soc, XVIII, where the description occurs, blank, 

 we should infer that it had not appeared when he proposed the new 

 generic name. Furthermore, the very paper in which P. chloronotus 

 is described is entitled a supplement to the Catalogue! This would 

 seem to make Porphyrula untenable, being based on a nomen nudum. 

 I On the other hand, the appendix of the Catalogue, which has every 

 appearance of being strictly a part of it, is dated 1852. If this is the 

 real date of issue it will, of course, make the name Porphyrula avail- 

 able, but it will also raise the question of priority between it and 

 lonornis, which likewise dates from 1852. 



Some additional light upon the actual date of publication of Blyth's 

 Catalogue seems to be badly needed.

 wing molt; and both it and one of the August specimens are obviously 

 young of the year. The other August bird is in the midst of the molt 

 of the flight feathers, while the body molt is nearly completed. It pre- 

 sents an entirely different appearance from the spring adult, being 

 dark plumbeous instead of brown, with white tips to the tertials. The 

 resemblance of the June specimen in the brown breeding plumage to 

 the North American Stelgidopteryx serripennis is remarkable.

Two specimens of a Cisticola obtained in El Bolossa swamp, Septem-

 bill and long tail it is evidently related to C. prinioides Neuman, but 

 apparently differs in coloration. 



2 1 am under obligations to Mr. Harry C. Oberholser, of the U. S, Department 



of Agriculture, for aid in identifying the species of this difficult genus. 




772 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [NoV., 



The type specimen (No. 381 Coll. G. L. Harrison, Jr., El Bolossa 

 swamp, Brit. E. Africa, September 19, 1904, ad. c?) is nearly uniform 

 above, the dark shaft stripes being but faintly indicated. The pre- 

 vailing color is sepia, with the edges of the feathers lighter, the head 

 slightly more tawny than the back, being about raw umber of Ridg- 

 way's Nomenclature of Colors. The edges of the flight feathers are 

 russet, the tail bistre with lighter edgings. Below grayish w^hite, 

 darker and inclining to buff on the sides and flanks, only approaching 

 pure white on the throat, chin and middle of the abdomen, thighs 

 russet. Length (skin) 155 mm., wing 61, tail 71. 



The other specimen is in the juvenal plumage and is uniform russet 

 brown above the under surface more suffused with buff than in the 

 adult. 



The species is named in honor of Mr. George Leib Harrison, Jr. 



Through the courtesy of the U. S. National Museum I have received 

 through Dr. Chas. W. Richmond a series of C. prinoides, collected by 

 Dr. W. L. Abbott on Mt. Kilimanjaro, for comparison with this spec- 

 imen. I find that C. harrisoni is at once distinguished by the more 

 uniform, less striped back, by the brighter, more ochraceous tone of 

 the upper parts and the lack of decided contrast between the color of 

 the head and back. The bill is moreover distinctly more slender. 



Another Kilimanjaro specimen, identified by Mr. Oberholser^ as C. 

 hunteri, is also before me, and appears to be more nearly allied to C. 

 prinoides than to C. harrisoni, differing in its duller, more sooty col- 

 oration. While all three are closely related, C. harrisoni stands at one 

 extreme of the series well removed from the other two.

HAWAIIAN SPECIES OF ENDODONTA AND OPEAS. 



BY H. A. PILSBRY AND E. G. VANATTA. 



Some five species of the typical group of Endodonts have been de- 

 scribed from these islands. One of these, E. binaria (Pfr.), is unlike the 

 others in wanting palatal teeth. Two, E. laminata (Pse.) and E. api- 

 culata Anc, are roughly sculptured, and two, E. lamellosa (Fer.) and E. 

 fricki (Pfr.), are smoothish, marked with weak growth-lines only. The 

 present paper deals with the smooth species. According to Mr. 

 Thaanum, these snails are found among dead leaves on the ground, 

 never on logs or stumps. The round-whorl ed, ribbed Endodonts, such 

 as E. ludijera and E.thaanumi, live on dead stumps and logs, and under 

 the bark of dead trees, but also among fallen leaves. E. lanaiensis was 

 found at Mapulehu, Molokai, under bark and on stumps. 



Endodonta lamellosa (Fer.). PI. XLIII, figs. 7, 8. 



Helix lamellosa Fer., Histoire, etc., I, p. 369, PI. 51A, fig. 3. 



The locality of the original specimens of this species is not known. 

 Specimens labelled Kauai in the collection of the Academy agree best 

 with the original figm"es, one of these being illustrated on our plate. 

 This shell measures, alt. 3.5, diam. 9.5 mm., and has 6^ whorls. The 

 umbilicus is rounded at the bottom, being at first thimble-shaped with 

 sub vertical walls; then the suture diverges more, leaving a narrow, fiat 

 spiral terrace which descends about 1 to If turns, the side wall remain- 

 ing vertical except on the last half whorl where it slopes outward a 

 little, as shown in fig. 8. The keel does not project at the suture on 

 the upper siu-face, though visible there. The upper parietal lamella 

 is distinctly bifid. 



Somewhat smaller shells have been examined from Waianae, Oahu 

 (D. D. Baldwin), and a small race also occurs at Mt. Lihau, near 

 Lahaina, West Maui (D. Thaanum). 



Mr. Sykes has placed E. fricki (Pfr.) under E. lamellosa as a synonym, 

 but without stating that he had seen the type. As originally described 

 and figured, it differs from lamellosa by the absence of a columellar 

 lamella. This is, next to the parietal, the most constant of the laminae 

 in Endodonta, and its absence, if confirmed by other specimens and not

pathologic, would seem to be of some significance. We have not seen 

 specimens. 



Endodonta marsupialis n. sp. PI. XLIII, figs, l, 2. 



Shell lenticular; nearly smooth; light horn colored profusely macu- 

 lated with reddish brown; spire elevated, convexly conoid; whorls 6^ 

 nearly flat, overhanging a little at the suture; periphery acutely keeled ; 

 base convex, with a shallow depression near the peripheral keel; the 

 umbilicus is about one-fifth the diameter of the shell, angular at the 

 edge; the whorls within the umbilicus concave, the side walls sloping 

 inward, and hence the cavity is wider within than at the opening, where 

 the whorl projects in a sort of cord. 



Aperture oblique, trapezoidal, provided with two spirally entering 

 parietal lamellae, the outer one largest and bifid, one columellar lamella, 

 four l)asal plicae and one palatal plica. 



Alt. 4, diam. 8 mm. 



Oahu. Types in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 No. 58,190, presented by Mr. J. S. Phillips. 



Some specimens have an extra smaller basal and palatal plica near 

 the peripheral angle and some are albinos, corneous yellow, without 

 dark markings. 



This species may be distinguished from E. lameUosa (Fer.) by its 

 smaller umbilicus and higher spire; from E. kamehameha by its greater 

 size, larger teeth and elevatefl spire. It is distinguished from E. con- 

 centrata by the greater size and more numerous teeth. It differs from 

 all the other forms by its cavern-like umbilicus, in which the eggs are 

 deposited. 



This snail represents a line of differentiation parallel to the section 

 Libera Garrett, in the structure of the umbilicus. 



Endodonta kamehameha n. sp. PI. XLIII, figs. 3, 4. 



Shell lenticular; nearly smooth; yellowish olive, often with the last 

 whorl partly brown, with some traces of darker brown maculation on 

 the spire. Spire moderately depressed, composed of 5^ flat whorls; 

 suture linear; periphery acutely keeled; base conical, slightly impressed 

 near the periphery. Umbilicus about one-third the diameter of the 

 shell, wide and rounded at the bottom, thimble-like with sub vertical 

 walls at first, then becoming perspective, terraced, a narrow ledge run- 

 ning down about 1^ whorls, the side walls remaining vertical, only 

 sloping outward a little at the last half w'horl. Aperture oblique, 

 trapezoidal, furnished with two spirally entering parietal lamellae, one

columellar lamella, three basal plicae and one palatal plica, all of which 

 are much weaker than in E. lamellosa (Fer.). 



Alt. 2.75, diam. 6 mm. 



Locahty: Wailau Pali, Mapulehu, Molokai. The types are in the 

 collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, No. 90,140, presented by 

 Mr. D. Thaanum. 



This species has a proportionately larger umbilicus than E. lamellosa 

 (Fer.) or concentrata P. and V., and the teeth are much smaller than 

 in either. The umbilicus resembles that of E. lamellosa. It is utilized 

 as a receptacle for the eggs. 



Endodonta concentrata n. sp. PI. XLIII, figs. 5, 6. 



Shell lenticular; nearly smooth; marked with weak growth-lines 

 only; oliveaceous yellow becoming brown near the lip where the epi- 

 dermis is preserved, but usually in large part denuded of cuticle, gray- 

 ish, with irregular angular brown spots on the upper surface of the 

 last whorl, and often some marking on the base; spire convex, com- 

 posed of 5+ nearly flat whorls, separated by a linear suture. The last 

 half whorl a little descending, the preceding keel a little overhanging, 

 periphery sharply keeled ; base convex ; umbilicus about one-fifth the 

 diameter of the shell, well-shaped, a little contracted and rounded at 

 the edge, being perceptibly more ample within. Aperture trapezoidal, 

 obstructed by two parietal lamelte, the outer being the larger and 

 bifid; one columellar lamella; three basal plicae and one palatal plica. 

 Alt. 2.75; diam. 5 mm. 



Locality: Lanai. The types are in the collection of the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, No. 89,241, presented by Mr. D. 

 Thaanum. This Endodonta is smaller than E. lamellosa (Fer.) and 

 marsupialis P. and V. It has the opening of the umbilicus contracted as 

 in marsupialis but to a less degree, and neither sharp-edged nor pro- 

 vided with a spiral cord. As in E. marsupialis, the eggs are carried in 

 the umbilicus. The apertural laminae are well developed, much larger 

 than in E. kamehameha P. and V. 



Opeas opella n. sp. Fig. l. 



Shell cream colored, glossy, indistinctly irregularly striate, rather 

 stout, apex obtuse, whorls six moderately convex, body whorl high, 

 umbilicus very small, aperture ovate more than one-third the height 

 of the shell, outer lip evenly arched, columella sinuous and reflexed 

 over the umbilical perforation.

Locality: Honolulu. This species is a little larger and more

 It is smaller and more openly umbilicate than 0.

 Academy. 



Opeas junceum, hawaiense and upolense are taken, 

 Mr. Thaanum informs us, under stones and bits of 

 board, etc., in gardens and open country. Their 

 occurrence in such places affords no proof that they 

 are native Hawaiians, but, so far as it goes, makes for 



that they are immigrants

Besides the typical form of this species, 

 which measures about 12 to 14 mm. long, 

 there is a very small form, with nearly the 

 same shape and sculpture. Specimens 

 measure from length 7.8, diam. 2.5 mm.,

whorls of the spire, a single 

 rather prominent wide one on the last whorl opposite the lip, and a swell- 

 ing behind the lip. The sculpture consists of inconspicuous longitudinal 

 folds below the sutures, very variable in strength and length, and numer- 

 ous spaced spiral cords which may be either smooth or weakly granose, 

 three threads usually occupying each of the spaces between the cords, the 

 middle thread often larger. There are generally five to seven of the 

 larger cords on the penultimate whorl. The early whorls have four 

 spiral cords and numerous narrow longitudinal folds, producing a can- 

 cellated pattern. Whorls 11 to 12, the first one smooth, following 

 several whorls convex, the rest but slightly so. The last whorl is some- 

 what flattened above, rounded at and below the periphery, and ter- 

 minates in a very short, slightly recurved anterior canal. The suture 

 is very shallow below, becoming impressed above. Aperture oval, 

 acuminate above, the outer lip strongly arcuate; basal notch deep and 

 open, obliciue. The inner lip is covered with a rather strong callus 

 with raised outer edge, and calloused near the posterior angle of the 

 aperture.

This species varies widely in the degree of development of the longi- 

 tudinal folds, and especially in the sculpture of the major spiral cords, 

 which may be either smooth, slightly granose or rather strongly so. 

 The contour of the shell is also subject to some variation. C. papillosum 

 Sowb. {Thes. Conch., II, p. 876, PI. 184, fig. 215) is apparently related to 

 nesioticum, but differs in sculpture and coloration. 



It seems to be a common species over a large part of the Indo- 

 Pacific life-area.

NOTES ON THE ORTHOPTERA OF COSTA RICA, WITH DESCRIPTIONS 

 OF NEW SPECIES. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN, 



The following notes and descriptions are based on a study of over 

 three hundred and fifty specimens, representing one hundred species, 

 of which eleven are here described as new. This material is distributed 

 through the collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 

 delphia, the United States National Museum and the private collection 

 of Mr. Morgan Hebard, of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. 



The writer is much indebted to Prof. P. Biolley, of San Jose, Costa 

 Rica, who courteously supplied some very valuable material accom- 

 panied by full notes and remarks, and also to Dr. William H. Ashmead, 

 of the United States National Museum, and Mr. Hebard for permission 

 to study the collections mentioned above. 



The number of records here ])ublished which extend the range of 

 species is rather remarkable, and clearly shows the lack of definite 

 information regarding the Orthoptera of northern South America. 



The Forficulidae, Blattidse, Mantidse, Phasmidse and Acrididse of the 

 greater portion of these collections have already been studied and 

 reported by the author.^

Closely allied to B. thoracicus, but differing in the slightly smaller 

 size, narrower and longer anal area of the tegmina as well as the less 

 distinct and more numerous nervures of the same area, the subtruncate 

 and narrowly incised supra-anal plate, the broader subgenital plate 

 and rather different coloration. 



Size medium; form elongate ovoid. Head with the narrowest por- 

 tion of the interspace between the eyes about equal to the greatest 

 dorso-ventral depth of the eyes ; antennae about a 

 fourth again as long as the width of the pronotum. 

 Pronotum subovate, transverse, half again as broad 

 as long; cephalic margin subangulate, caudal 

 margin arcuate, cephalo-lateral sections moderately 

 deflected . Tegmina elongate, costal margin arcuate, 

 more distinctly so proximad than distad; apex 

 narrowly rounded ; sutural margin arcuate in the 

 distal third rounding to the apex ; venation distinct, 

 the costal area only irregular reticulate; anal area 

 about two-fifths the length of the tegmen, the anal 

 vein slightly but evenly arcuate. vSupra-anal plate 

 rather broad, bilobate, the median emargination 

 V-shaped, rather shallow and broad. Cerci short, 

 very slightly exceeding the supra-anal plate, taper- 

 ing. Subgenital plate large, broad, slightly pro- 

 duced, the apex blunt and rather narrowly rounded. Femora with- 

 out spines on the ventral margins. Cephalic tarsi with the distal joint 

 slightly longer than the proximal ; median tarsi with the proximal and 

 distal joints subequal; caudal tarsi wnth the proximal joint slightly 

 longer than the distal. 



General color pale clay-color, the pronotum with the ground color 

 ochraceous. Head pale ochraceous, with the region between the eyes, 

 between the paired ocelli, except a median spot of the base color, and 

 a median line on the lower face burnt umber; eyes blackish; antennae 

 blackish-brown. Pronotum with a broad bar of blackish on the caudal 

 margin, tapering laterad and disappearing before the angles of greatest 

 width, two pairs of irregularly rounded spots of the same color situated 

 before the middle and in pairs with the space between them slightly 

 greater than their distance from the cephalic margin, caudad of these 

 a pair of rather large comma-shaped spots of the same color and caudad 

 of these a pair of roughly trigonal spots. 



Limbs with the tarsi, tibiae and distal sections of the femora suffused 

 with burnt umber. Abdomen with the lateral marks of the dark

 One male. 



As far as can be determined from the broken male figured and de- 

 scribed by Westwood, this appears to be the same species. It is, how- 

 ever, somewhat smaller, and has the antennae longer than in West- 

 wood's figm-e and equal to the body in length, instead of reaching 

 "rather beyond the middle of the metathorax." 



The species of the genus Bostra in hand for study are four: incomptn 

 Rehn,^ jaliscensis Rehn,'* jugalis Rehn-^ and turgida Westwood. The 

 males of all these species are now before me and can be separated by 

 the following key: 



a. — Cerci not exceeding the subgenital opercule proper (i.e., the eighth 

 ventral segment) in length. 

 b. — Ninth dorsal abdominal segment somewhat bullate, the caudal 

 margin bilobate, with the median emargination subtrigonal. 

 Subgenital opercule without a distinct claw-like process. 

 c. — Median segment in length not exceeding one-half the re- 

 maining portion of the metanotmn. Cerci slightly 



tapering, B. turgida (Westw.). 



cc. — Median segment in length nearly equal to the remaining 

 portion of the metanotum. Cerci not tapering, 



B. incompta Rehn. 

 bb. — Ninth dorsal abdominal segment longitudinal, subequal, hot 

 bullate, the caudal margin laterad acute-angulate and brace- 

 shaped'' between. Subgenital opercule with a distinct 

 claw-like process ventrad of the caudal margin, 



B. jaliscensis Rehn.

B. jugalis Rehn. 



Stal's B. dorsuariri' and Scudder's B. exigua^ are known from the 

 males, while B. remiformis Rehn^ is based on the female sex. The 

 latter has the median segment two-thirds the length of the metanotum 

 itself, which fact would associate it with jaliscensis, inco7npta and 

 jugalis. As the female of jugalis is known it is certainly not that 

 species, while the other two species are very much larger in the male 

 sex than the female type of remiformis. Accordingly I think it a good 

 species of which the male is unknown.

 appendages, the reduction of the lobes on the median and caudal 

 limbs, the absence of especially pronounced lobes on the second ab- 

 dominal segment and the presence of such on the fifth segment, and the 

 shorter caudal limbs. 



Size rather small; form moderately robust; surface closely supplied

 lobes, about twice as high as the eye is deep, margins of the lobes irregu- 

 larly crenulate; eyes short ovate; antennae about equal to the head

On comparison with specimens of Chortophaga viridifasciata from 

 the eastern United States, I find great difficulty in separating this 

 specimen. The pronotal carina is slightly less arched, but the size is 

 considerably greater than given in the original description. The sulca- 

 tion of the frontal costa appears deeper than in viridifasciata instead 

 of shallower, but as the specimen in hand appears to have been in alco- 

 hol, preparation may have caused this. Several races of C. viridifasciata 

 of value equal to this exist in the United States.

These specimens are referred here with some little doubt. They

 The two in hand are larger than Guadalajara and Jalapa individuals of

 female. 



As far as can be determined from the descriptions these specimens 

 appear referable to this species, but probably will represent a closely 

 allied form when compared with typical Surinam individuals. The 

 lateral bars are not sharply separated from the wine-color of the 

 dorsum, but present a strong contrast with the yellowish of the ventral 

 portions. 



The genus Cornops as defined by StaP- appear to agree better with 

 these specimens than does Scudder's description. This may be due 

 to the fact that Stal's description was based on longipenne.

"The genus Steirodon was based on three forms: citrifolius, prasinus and 

 thoracicus. The second was removed to Trigonocorypha in 1874; the third 

 to Posidippus the same year. The first, citrifolius, was based wholly on references 

 as follows: 



Locusta citrifolia Fab., Ent. Svst., No. 1. 

 De Geer, Mem., t. Ill, p. 437, PI. 37, fig. 3.

 Phyllophora citrifolia Thunb., M6m. de I'Acad. Imp. des Sc. de Saint-P^tersb., 

 t. V, p. 286. 

 The references of Fabricius and De Geer were based on Linn^'s Gryllus (Tet- 

 tigonia) citrifolius, which was placed in Posidippus in 1874. Stoll's figure was 

 considered a Peucestes the same year, leaving Thunberg's misidentification, later 

 named by Stal, who examined the Thunberg material, as the type.

This quite distinct species varies somewhat in size and from a green- 

 ish-brown to a distinct green in color, with the small fuscous annuli 

 practically absent in some specimens. 



This species is more austral than the others of the genus, having 

 been recorded but once from outside of Costa Rica, then from San 

 Geronimo, Guatemala. The previous definite Costa Rican records are 

 irom Rio Sucio, Cache and Volcan de Irazu.

Carrillo. [Hebard Collection.] Twenty-eight males, nine females. 



This form is probably, as Brunner says, a small type of tessellata. 

 The large series examined is rather uniform in size, but the coloration 

 varies greatly, both in the general color and the presence or intensity 

 of the fuscous annuli of the tegmina. Most of the males have the 

 tambourine marked laterad more or less regularly with brownish, and 

 the paler specimens which are little marked with fuscous have the 

 femoral spines with the dark color restricted to a very slight apical 

 touch. 



The previous Costa Rican records of this species are from San Jose, 



La Uruca, El Coronal, Tucurrique, La Palma, Turrialba and Monte 



Redondo.

The material examined fully demonstrates the variability of this 

 species in color, some being strongly dotted with fuscous and with the 

 usual large annuli distinct, while others are almost uniform green. 

 Considerable variation is also exhibited in size, and some individuals 

 might be referred to either tessellatus or conspersus. This is particu- 

 larly true of the individuals from Carrillo. 



The previous Costa Rican records are from Volcan de Irazu, Cache 

 and Santa Clara.

 equal to the length of the pronotum. Ovipositor about twice the 

 length of the pronotum, saber-like in form, the greatest width slightly 

 less than a third the length and in the distal half, apex acute, dorsal 

 margin straight with a slight proximal curve, ventral margin almost 

 straight in the proximal half, strongly arcuate in the distal half, mar-

The specific name refers to the appendages of the subgenital plate. 



In addition to the type, a badly damaged male individual from 

 Esparta (altitude 50 meters; no. 45; P. Biolley) is referred with some 

 doubt to this species. The tegmina are somewhat slenderer than in the 

 type, but the venation is similar, while the head and pronotum, as well 

 as the sternal lobes, are identical. Subgenital plate and supra-anal 

 plate are as in A. lanceolata Brunner, the cerci however differ in being 

 without a basal lobule and having a spiral twist instead of being 

 straight and lanceolate.

Allied to C. castus Brunner, from I\Iexico, but differing in the larger 

 size, the shape of the emargination of the male anal segment, and the 

 shape of the supra-anal and subgenital plates. It can be separated 

 from C. ignobilis Brunner, a near ally, by the shape of the anal seg- 

 ment, the supra-anal plate and the undilated styles.

 strongly declivent toward the fastigium; fastigium short, acuminate, 

 narrow, horizontal, sulcate proximad with the lateral margins elevated 

 into rather low rounded j^rocesses, a])ex acute, compressed, about 

 reaching to the margins of the antennal scrol^es; facial fastigium con- 

 tiguous with the fastigium of the vertex; eyes short ovoid, the point 

 directed ventrad, prominent; antennae contained two (cJ^) to two and 

 a half times ( 9 ) in the length of the body. Pronotum scabrose,

 cato-arcuate, no lateral angles marked except faintly on the "shoulders," 

 two transverse sulci distinctly marked, the caudal more distinct than 

 the cephalic; lateral lobes distinctly longer than deep, the ventral mar- 

 gin nearly straight, the angles subrectangulate, caudal transverse 

 sulcus extending to the ventral margin in a ventro-cephalic direction, 

 a supplementary sulcus being present caudad of this and extending 

 ventro-caudad to the angle. Tegmina very slightly exceeding the body 

 in length elongate lanceolate, the greatest width being contained about 

 four and a half times in the length; costal and sutural margins very

A series of seventeen specimens, five males, twelve females, of this 

 species have been examined. The localities represented are: San 

 Jose, September, 1902, three males, six females; Monte Redondo, Janu- 

 ary, 1903, one male; Tarbaca, October and November, 1902, one male, 

 three females; Cizahar de Cartago, October, 1902, one female; Tablazo, 

 November, 1902, one female; Guatel, August, 1902, one female. 



This series exhibits considerable variation in size and a slight amount 

 in color, but in this regard chiefly in the strength of the greenish suf- 

 fusion of the tegmina. In a few specimens the tegmina are somewhat 

 tessellated by the infuscation of veins, but usually this is not pro- 

 nounced. The pronotum is in several specimens rather dark, while the 

 cingulate margin is light colored, producing a decided contrast. The 

 most striking variation, however, is in size, one male and several 

 females being considerably smaller than the types of their respective 

 sexes.

This specimen presents some points of difference from the descrip- 

 tion of spiniger^ and may represent the female of E. longipennis Red- 

 tenbacher from Costa Rica, known only from the male; but that species 

 is said to have the "meso- et metasternum lobis rotundatis," while the 

 specimen in hand has the lateral margins of the mesosternum elevated 

 and developed into rather blunt flattened spines. On the other hand 

 the fastigium is flattened above, while in spiniger this is "superne hand 

 deplanatum," and in longipennis "superne planum." The ovipositor 

 is typical of spiniger. 



This species was previously known only from the type locality.

Allied to A. mexicana (Saussure), but differing in the fully developed 

 tegmina and wings, the rotundate caudal margin of the pronotum, the 

 more rotundate ventral margin of the lateral lobes and the different 

 coloration. The new form appears to be closely related to A. alata 

 (Brunner),^" which was very poorly described and based on a muti- 

 lated specimen, but which appears to differ in the roundly inserted 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum.

These specimens appear to represent this long unrecognized species. 

 Superficially the coloration resembles species of the genus Amphiacusta,. 

 but the peculiar rostrum and slenderer limbs readily differentiate it. 

 The anal filaments are very long, considerably exceeding the ovipositor. 

 The coloration of the limbs is very rich, the caudal femora being wine- 

 color with one complete and one broken distal annulus of ochre.

It is with some doubt that I place this specimen under this species, 

 as it differs considerably in color and has the caudal femora slightly 

 smaller than Saussure's measurements. The caudal metatarsi have 

 very well developed spines, but Saussure says they are " enormes." 

 The head (except the eyes, rostrum and antennal fossa), pronotum 

 and cephalic and median limbs are blackish-brown, while the tegmina 

 are sienna. 



The specimen apparently fits no other species, but may be quite dis- 

 tinct from the true silens.

The Publication Committee reported that papers under the following 

 titles had been offered for publication since the last meeting : 



"Coon Mountain and Its Crater." By Daniel Moreau Barringer. 

 (December 5.) 



"Coon Butte, Arizona." By Benjamin Chew Tilghman. (Decem- 

 ber 5.) 



Coon Mountain and its Crater. — Dr. Dixon announced that Mr. 

 Daniel Moreau Barringer and Mr. Benjamin Chew Tilghman, members 

 of the Academy, had notified him of their discovery that the crater 

 of Coon Mountain or Coon Butte, in northern Arizona, twelve miles 

 southeast of Cailon Diablo Station on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa 

 Fe Railway, is an impact crater and not a crater produced by a steam 

 explosion, as has been supposed since the examination made of it by 

 members of the United States Geological Survey. They have proved, 

 by a large amount of development work, according to their statements, 

 that the large crater and elevation known as Coon Mountain is the 

 result of a collision with the earth of a veiy large meteorite, or possibly 

 a small asteroid, fragments of which are well known to the scientific 

 world by the name of the Canon Diablo siderites. Their development 

 work, consisting of cuts, shafts and boreholes, has established the fol- 

 lowing facts: 



First. That the formation of the crater and the deposition of 

 the meteoric material were simultaneous. 



Second. That meteoric material has been found five hundred feet 

 below the surface of the center of the crater; and, 



Third. That sandstone supposed to be in place exists less than one 

 thousand feet below the surface of the center of the crater. 



Mr. Barringer and Mr, Tilghman have presented to the Academy 

 for publication two comprehensive papers in which they set forth in 

 full their reasons for the above statements. 



Dr. Henry Skinner made a communication on his collecting trip of 

 last summer to the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona. (No abstract.)

846 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



NEW SPECIES OF AMPHARETID^ AND TEREBELLIDiE FROM THE 

 NORTH PACIFIC. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



Among the Polychseta dredged by the steamer Albatross while in the 

 service of the Alaskan Salmon Commission of 1903 occur the following 

 new species. Two previous papers based upon the same collections 

 have been published in these Proceedings for 1905. 



AmpMcteis alaskensis sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 1-4.) 



The available examples of this species vary in length from 22 to 76 

 mm. One selected for the type is 33 mm. long, of which the thorax is 

 19 mm.; its greatest width is 4.3 mm., and the cephalic cone is 2.3 mm. 

 in both length and breadth. 



Counting the region of trunk anterior to the paleoli as formed of 

 two somites, the worm consists of thirty-four segments and the py- 

 gidium. The setigerous segments are from III to XX inclusive, and the 

 uncinigerous VII to XXXV inclusive. 



The median prostomial plate (fig. 1) is shield-shaped, about twice as 

 long as broad, the posterior end pointed, the anterior cleft in the middle 

 and formed of two somewhat divergent lobes. On each side of, the 

 plate is a broad, low, lateral ridge broadly rounded anteriorly and reach- 

 ing not quite so far forward as the median plate. Bounding both these 

 ridges and the plate posteriorly is a pair of transverse folds curving 

 slightly forward laterally and caudad medially to meet in the median 

 line at a sharp angle. These ridges are pigmented with brown above and 

 they form the angle at which the nearly vertical anterior portion of the 

 prostomium meets the nearly horizontal posterior region. The latter 

 is much broader than the former and at its convex posterior margin 

 nearly twice as wide as long. All of these parts taken together consti- 

 tute the dorsal face of the prostomium. Beneath, and usually retracted 

 within the mouth, is the folded tentacular membrane bearing a few 

 short slender tentacles which scarcely exceed the cephalic cone in 

 length. The somewhat quadrate prostomium is bounded by the short 

 peristomial ring which completes the base of the cephalic cone. 



The large mouth is bounded below by the prominent thickened peris- 

 tomial lip, while dorsally the peristomium is much shorter and over- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 847 



lapped by the branchial ridge medially and more extensively by the 

 paleolar tubercles laterally. This region is biannulate. The third 

 somite is somewhat enlarged and tumid ventrally, the dorso-lateral 

 portions project as thickened prominences bearing the paleoli, while 

 the dorsal half is merely a low welt, strongly concave along its anterior 

 margin and partly covered by the branchial ridge. 



Somites IV and V are much shorter, together barely equaling III, and 

 coalesced dorsally to form the ridge upon which the branchia3 are sup- 

 ported. The branchiae form a group of four on each side so arranged 

 that three are attached in a transverse anterior row on the region corre- 

 sponding to somite IV and only one more posteriorly on V. Between 

 the branchial scars of the two sides is a smooth quadrate area nearly 

 twice as long as broad which is slightly inserted posteriorly into a 

 transversely elongated area which reaches across the entire distance 

 between the posterior pair of scars. A single branchia remains. This 

 is slightly flattened, especially toward the tip, s regularly tapered to 

 a slender end and its length about equals the greatest diameter of the 

 thorax. 



The next four or five somites increase slightly in both length and 

 diameter, and then decrease in diameter but remian of constant length 

 throughout the thoracic region. Each is divided into a dorsal and a 

 ventral half-ring by the prominent setigerous tubercles. The latter 

 have thick glandular walls and the intersegmental furrows are deep 

 and well defined. The dorsal region is thin-walled and smooth, and 

 the first five intersegmental furrows only are distinct. 



Abdominal segments taper gradually to the pygidium and are no- 

 where distinctly defined by furrows. Dorsally the walls are high- 

 arched, thin and smooth, ventrally they are thickened by a pair of 

 prominent longitudinal muscle ridges with a neural groove between. 

 Laterally between the parapodia of successive segments is a series of 

 rugous areas, while across the ventral surface between each pair of 

 parapodia a narrow glandular line frequently extends. 



The pygidium is provided with a pair of thick lips bounding the ver- 

 tical, slit-like anus and each bearing on the side an inconspicuous cirrus 

 much shorter than the diameter of the pygidium. 



Of the setigerous tubercles the pair bearing the paleoli are prominent 

 and much larger than any others and they encroach nnich upon the 

 lateral portions of the peristomium. The paleoli are about twenty 

 (18-21) in number in each group and are inserted with their long diam- 

 eters radial around an arc of nearly two-thirds of a circle. From this 

 base they spread forwards and laterad in a broad, scoop-like figure. 




848 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The tubercles of IV and V are crowded closely together beneath the 

 lateral margins of the branchial scars, that of the latter being slightly 

 medial and caudal of the other. Both, and especially the latter, are 

 minute. Succeeding tubercles up to the sixth increase in size, after 

 which they remain of constant size and of a slightly flattened cylin- 

 drical form. Distinct, more or less club-shaped cirri are borne on the 

 ventral side of the distal portion of all the tubercles, but they are larger 

 and more abruptly clavate on the first four. The first and second tufts 

 contain only six or eight sets, the others twelve to fifteen, always 

 arranged in two rows. 



The uncinigerous tori are distinct, somewhat ear-shaped lappets aris- 

 ing from the posterior border of the segments below and separated by 

 a short space from the setigerous tubercles. The anterior ones are the 

 longest and their ends project most freely. Their size decreases regu- 

 larly to the last thoracic. The uncini form a single irregularly curved 

 line containing 160 to 170, which are largest dorsally and decrease reg- 

 ularly to the ventral end. 



Abdominal somites are provided with shorter tori (fig. 2) which pro- 

 ject more prominently than those of the thoracic segments. They bear 

 about 75 uncini in a single series. No trace of ventral cirri can be 

 detected, but the achcetous notopodia are provided with prominent, 

 curved, paddle-shaped cirri. 



The paleoli form rather close spreading tufts, with the largest ones 

 near the anterior margin but not reaching to the tip of the prostomium. 

 They (fig. 3) are much flattened and moderately stout at the base and 

 taper rather abruptly to acute tips. They are bright yellow and pol- 

 ished. The setae are pale yellow, strongly striated, slightly curved, with 

 narrow double wings and very acute tips. On the first three somites 

 they are rather more slender than on the others. 



The uncini (figs. 4a to c) are more or less triangular, with the upper 

 rounded portion much elevated, the posterior ligament process very 

 prominent, and the anterior one small and covered by the lowermost 

 hook. The base is relatively short. The relative breadth to length 

 varies. Usually there are six large, acute, closely appressed teeth or 

 fangs, the clefts between which do not incise the base very deeply (less 

 than one-half of the entire width of the uncinus). Frequently the 

 upper tooth is much reduced in size. 



The type of this species was taken with one other specimen at station 

 4,274, in Kadiak Bay, at a dej^th of 41 fathoms on a bottom of green 

 mud with some fine sand. Another and larger one comes from Boca de 

 Quadra, Southeast Alaska, in 48 fathoms and soft green mud. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 849 



Amphicteis alaskensis is easily distinguished from the species recorded 

 in my paper of Japanese Polychseta, under the name of A. japonica Mc- 

 intosh, by the character of the paleoh, which in the latter species are 

 only ten or twelve, and when perfect have slender curved tips reaching 

 far beyond the end of the prostomium. 



Amphicteis glabra sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 5 to 8.) 



The two known examples of this species are of moderate size, the 

 type having a length of 23 mm., of which 15 mm. belong to the thorax, 

 which is 3 mm. wide. 



The form is rather slender, slightly clavate, and gently tapered. 

 There are 20 thoracic segments, 17 of which are setigerous, and 15 ab- 

 dominal segments, or possibly more as the extreme posterior end is 

 macerated. 



The entire prostomial region is relatively much broader than in A. 

 alaskensis and its median plate (fig. 5) much wider than long, irreg- 

 ularly pentagonal, with the long anterior border cleft into a pair of 

 short divergent lobes, from between which a broad median groove ex- 

 tends about halfway across the dorsal surface. On each side of this plate 

 is a small triangular area, which is again bounded laterally by a narrow 

 fold ending freely in front. The pigmented transverse ridges occur as in 

 A. alaskensis, but are longer correspondingly to the width of the prosto- 

 mium, which they cross nearly transversely; beginning at the posterior 

 end of the lateral fold mentioned above they arch forward and meet 

 at a wide angle in the median line immediately behind the apex of the 

 cephalic plate. The entire dorsal surface of the prostomium lies in 

 nearly the same plane, and its anterior portion is not bent downward at 

 an angle with the rest as in A. alaskensis. The tentacular membrane is 

 rather low and has a nearly regular elliptical outline, and the few ten- 

 tacles remaining are scarcely longer than the entire prostomium. 



The upper lip is slightly cleft medially and the peristomium in the 

 region of the lower lip is enlarged and more or less tumid. Ventrally 

 somite II is about one-third as long as the prostomium, and dorsally it 

 exhibits a transversely elongated median area slightly elevated above 

 and separated from the surrounding parts by a slight groove. Somite 

 III is nearly as long as I ventrally; dorso-laterally it is prominently 

 enlarged to bear the paleoli, and dorsally becomes very much reduced 

 in length to form a narrow border that passes along the anterior margin 

 of the branchiferous area and joins the median interbranchial area of 

 IV. Succeeding somites are well differentiated and of nearly equal 

 length throughout the thoracic region. The dorsal portion includes 

 55 




850 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



more than a semicircumference and is very smooth and iridescent. The 

 ventral is much flatter, has deep bounding furrows and a transverse 

 glandular line near the anterior margin. The ventral region slightly 

 exceeds the dorsal in width and embraces it laterally so as to form a 

 shelf or flange supporting the setigerous tubercles. The thoracic region 

 tapers regularly into the abdominal, which differs from it little except 

 in the form of the parapodia and the more prominent lateral muscles 

 and deeper neural groove. The pygidium is much injured on both 

 specimens. 



Branchia have existed in the usual four pairs, but a single one only 

 remains in place. It is nearly terete but somewhat compressed and 

 tapers regularly from the base to the slender subulate tip. Its length 

 is about equal to the width of the thorax or when appressed it reaches 

 somite IX. The scars (fig. 5) show the branchiae to have been more 

 crowded than in A. alaskensis and to arise in a distinctly quadrate 

 group, two pairs on each side. Apparently the two anterior belong to 

 somite IV and the two posterior to V, and the two medial are some- 

 what larger than the two lateral. A shield-shaped area about twice as 

 long as wide is present between the median branchise, reaching from the 

 anterior margin of IV to the middle of V where it meets a transversely 

 extended area limited laterally by the outer pair of branchise. 



The paleoli arise from the dorso-lateral tubercles of III and form an 

 open, spreading tuft, little concave and arising from a small arc. They 

 number but eight or ten and all are slender and curved, with awn-like 

 tips (fig. 7), and the longest reach beyond the tip of the snout. 



The setse tufts on the branchiferous segments are borne on small 

 papillae placed close together just laterad of the branchise. The setse 

 are few in number and much smaller than those on succeeding segments. 

 Remaining setigerous tubercles are cylindrical and quite prominent 

 with small truncate cirri, and bear compact tufts of about twelve setse 

 which are longer, more slender, and more curved than in A. alaskensis. 



Uncinigerous tori are short inconspicuous lines near the posterior 

 margins of the segments just below the setigerous tubercles. Poster- 

 iorly they become more prominent and on the abdominal segments 

 project freely, but are usually so macerated in these specimens that the 

 exact form is doubtful. The one represented in figure 6 shows the 

 thickened dorsal cirrus. 



The uncini (fig. 8) are narrow with very long base lines and five very 

 slender acute teeth very deeply divided at the base. The anterior lig- 

 ament process is rather conspicuous and lies beneath the lowermost 

 tooth, while the posterior ligament process is only moderately devel- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 851 



oped. The number of teeth is very constant and the dorsahnost are 

 not so greatly larger than the ventral as in A. alaskensis. On somite 

 X there are 115. Abdominal imcini are precisely similar/but^owing to 

 maceration the number on a torus is uncertain. 



This species was taken at station 4,227 OAly, in Behm Canal, the depth 

 being 62 fathoms and the bottom of dark green mud with fine sand. 



A small portion of tube present is rather elastic and springy'and is 

 coated externally with a layer of brownish flocculent sediment. 



Melinna cristata sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 9 and 10.) 



The single example representing this species closely resembles M. 

 cristata (Sars) Malmg., from which it differs especially in the more finely 

 denticulated post-branchial membrane as well as in the much larger 

 size and greater number of segments. 



Although the posterior extremity is missing and the last one-third of 

 the body is strongly spirally coiled, the specimen measures approx- 

 imately 73 mm. long, exclusive of the branchiae. At its widest part the 

 thorax measures 3 mm., while the abdomen has a maximum width of 

 2 mm. The 17 setigerous thoracic segments have a length of 12 mm. 

 and the fifty-five remaining abdominal segments 61 mm. 



The prostomium or cephalic plate is a broad, short plate with a 

 slightly convex crenulated anterior margin projecting freely over the 

 bases of the fourteen to sixteen tentacles. The latter have a uniform 

 diameter from base to end . The anterior and median ones are the largest 

 with a length of about one and one-half times the thoracic width and 

 about twice that of the posterior tentacles, which are scarcely as long as 

 the body width and about half the diameter of the anterior ones. On the 

 dorsal surface of the prostomium are the sensory folds, which are di- 

 rectly transverse. Beginning close to the lateral margins of the head 

 they meet at the middle line and bend slightly forward side by side. 

 Their dorsal surface is pigmented with a rich orange brown. Just in 

 front of them on each side is a small, slightly elevated pad. The much 

 folded upper lip is large and projects far beyond the mouth, just ante- 

 rior to which is a distinct glandular area. 



The lower lip is formed by the prominently projecting smooth margin 

 of the prostomium, which is indistinguishably united to the first setig- 

 erous segment. Dorso-laterally it forms a promineniwing anterior to the 

 firsttuftofsetse, whence it is continued caudally into a flange-like ridge 

 on each side of the thorax. Somites III and IV are well defined and to- 

 gether equal in length the single ring formed by the union of the prosto- 

 mium and first setigerous somite. The remaining thoracic segments are 




852 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



equal and well distinguished on the ventral side, but thin-walled and 

 coalesced dorsally. The ventral body walls between the tori are well 

 provided with glands forming indistinct ventral plates on each segment. 

 On the first four thoracic segments the flange-like ridges above the 

 setse are very distinct and, together with the pectinated membrane on 

 somite V, bound a quadrate area in which the branchiae arise. Anterior 

 to the gills this region is marked by several slight transverse furrows. 

 The postbranchial membrane is thin and deep and closely appressed to 

 the dorsum of the thorax. It springs from the anterior border of V, 

 and reaches nearly to the anterior border of IV, the free border being 

 provided with eighteen blunt but prominent teeth. 



The four pairs of branchiae are permanently bent forward over the 

 prostomium, and each has a length slightly exceeding twice the width 

 of the thorax. They are all rather thick and coarse and taper from 

 above the base to the bluntly pointed tip. For the basal one-fourth or 

 one-fifth they are constricted and those on each side coalesced and so 

 arranged that three lie externally, apparently arising from II, III and 

 IV, and one internally on somite III. Between the latter, and uniting 

 them across the middle line, is a thin membrane. 



Somites II, III and IV bear short oblique lines of small setae on the 

 highest part of the lateral ridge, on the medial side of which and just 

 posterior and lateral to the branchiae, there is on each side of III a 

 single very large claw-like spine. On V and all succeeding thoracic som- 

 ites the setae are in small tufts borne on truncate papilla? having the 

 usual position. Each tuft contains about eleven or twelve setse in two 

 rows. Thoracic tori are constricted at the base, broad, truncate and 

 beveled at the end. The uncini are borne on the thickest portion of 

 the bevel, so that the free, thin margin projects a considerable distance 

 beyond them. On somite X there are 63 uncini. Abdominal tori are 

 narrow but much longer and of uniform width throughout, and the un- 

 cini are borne on the extreme unbeveled end. Somite XXV bears 36 

 uncini. The notopodial cirri are small and not conspicuously enlarged 

 distally. 



The setae are all arranged in two equal rows. Those in one are larger, 

 stouter and more broadly winged. Otherwise they are similar in both 

 rows, and all have the stems slightly curved and strongly striated with 

 the ends very acute and tapering. The isolated postbranchial spine is 

 large and stout and has exactly the form figured by Mcintosh for M. 

 cristata. 



The uncini (figs. 9 and 10) also resemble those of that species. Usu- 

 ally they have three teeth above the ligament process, but occasionally 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 853 



there is a fourth small or even well-developed one at the apex. Abdom- 

 inal uncini differ from the thoracic only in their small size. 



The tube measures 5 mm. in diameter with a lumen of half that size. 

 The lining is a tough mucous membrane and the exterior a thick brittle 

 coat of dark gray mud. 



The type and only specimen was taken at station 4,258, in Lynn 

 Canal, on a muddy bottom at a depth of 300 fathoms. 



Artacama coniferi sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 11 to 13.) 



This species is established upon two specimens measuring 22 and 45 

 mm. long respectively and neither of which is complete. The small one 

 consists of 20 thoracic and 17 abdominal segments, is 3.5 mm. wide in 

 the anterior part of the thorax and 2.2 mm. wide in the abdomen and 

 posterior half of the thorax, and has the proboscis protruded for 3 mm. 

 The larger example has 20 thoracic and 35 abdominal segments, with 

 the caudal end still lacking. The proboscis is 6 mm. long, the thorax 

 17 mm. long, and its anterior half 6 mm. wide, while its posterior half 

 tapers into the abdomen, which has a diameter of 2.5 mm. 



The form is club-shaped with the first ten or eleven thoracic segments 

 much enlarged, the middle of the thorax more or less abruptly con- 

 tracted and the posterior portion tapered to the abdomen which con- 

 tinues to diminish to the posterior end. 



The proboscis, which protrudes ventral to the mouth, is a large sugar- 

 loaf -shaped organ as long as the first nine or ten segments, and has a 

 basal diameter nearly equaling these. At the apex is a slender con- 

 ical process about three times as long as thick, with its end rounded. 

 Into it the retractor muscle is inserted, and it stands out prominently 

 when the proboscis is extended. At the base the proboscis is some- 

 what rugous like the peristomium, with which it is continuous. Ex- 

 cept for the rugosities the basal one-third is smooth, but the remainder 

 bears small, low, rounded papillae arranged in irregular rows, at first 

 distant, but converging distally to the apical process, where they are 

 more crowded, being separated by at most their own diameter. 



The prostomium is folded into a double horseshoe-shaped oral fold 

 with a broad, thin, median plate or membrane above the mouth, and 

 behind this a pair of thick reflexed pads which become wider dorsally 

 and nearly meet in the median line, and which bear the very numerous 

 and much crowded tentacles. From the ventral end of the group, where 

 they are mere papillae, the latter increase until they almost equal the 

 branchial filaments. Usually they are very slender with the ends 

 enlarged. 




854 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The peristomium is longer dorsally than ventrally and is marked 

 with longitudinal creases which are continued on to the base of the 

 proboscis. Somite II is as long as the prostomium and ec^uals the com- 

 bined length of III and IV. Succeeding segments are again slightly 

 longer and are distinctly annulated. In the posterior thoracic region 

 the segments are divided by the setigerous tubercles into dorsal and 

 ventral halves, the latter being again divided into a posterior larger 

 and two anterior smaller annuli. Abdominal segments are annulated 

 both dorsally and ventrally. 



Three pairs of branchi^ occur on somites II, III and lY. Each is 

 composed of numerous slender filaments having a length about one-third 

 of the diameter of the body and sessile in a close tuft. The first con- 

 tains about thirty, the second twenty-five and the third fifteen, but the 

 number in each is probably greater in perfect specimens. 



Ten ventral plates occur on the somites IV to XIII ; the anterior ones 

 are obscure, the posterior distinct. All are very short, about one-fourth 

 to one-sixth as long as wide. 



Setigerous tubercles number seventeen, and occur on somites IV to 

 XX inclusive ; though connected with the side of the body by an integ- 

 umental fold they are very mobile, and the flattened, obliqvie tufts of 

 setse project prominently in various directions from near the dorsal end 

 of the uncinigerous tori. Posterior tufts are broader and more mobile. 



Anterior uncinigerous tori are long and narrow, extending over about 

 one-sixth of the circumference of the body and separated ventrally by 

 twice their length. Without becoming shorter they gradually ap- 

 proach ventrally until the intervening space is less than one-third their 

 length. On the abdominal segments the tori are much more prom- 

 inent and have a free ventral angle and a thin membranous wing arising 

 from the dorsal l)order. This wing is gradually reduced posteriorly 

 coincidently with a decrease in the size of the parapodium, but remains 

 fairly prominent to the last. 



What appears to be a slit-like sense organ is present on somite III 

 below the'gill. Small papilla occur ventral to the seta? tufts of Yl, Yll, 

 VIII and" IX. 



The setse are all slender, nearly colorless, longitudinally striated, 

 slightly curved and winged, and taper to very acute tips. In each tuft 

 they are arranged in two rows of twelve to fifteen each, those in one 

 row having longer and narrower wings (fig. 12), the others having them 

 shorter and broader (fig. 11). 



The uncini are arranged in a single series on the tori of somites \'^ to 

 X, are partly doubled on XI and completely in two series on XII to 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 855 



XX. They are small and their number rather large, about 140-150 on 

 V, 116 to 120 on X, about 110 in each series on XX and about 50 to 60 

 on the middle abdominal tori. They have the general form described 

 for other species of the genus (fig. 13). The base is small and oblique, 

 strongly convex below and with a prominent anterior angle, above 

 which is a deep narrow sinus from which a slender process bearing the 

 delicate, scarcely visible guard arises. There is no distinct neck, but 

 a large head with a slender, acute, strongly decurved and slightlj^ re- 

 flected beak, above which is the high, full crest with four cross rows of 

 teeth. 



No color remains. 



The type comes from station 4,194, in the Gulf of Georgia, the depth 

 being 111 fathoms and the bottom of soft green mud. The station 

 from which the second specimen was taken is unknown. 



Laena nuda sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 14, 15.) 



This is another imperfectly known species, the only specimen 

 available being a fragment of the anterior end measuring 21 mm. 

 long and 1.5 mm. across the thorax, and comprising 28 anterior seg- 

 ments. 



Projecting prominently from the anterior end is a broad, unfolded, 

 scoop-like prostomial membrane curving gently and regularly upward 

 from beside and above the mouth. Apparently the tentacles formed a 

 complete series around the margin of the posterior limb of the pro- 

 stomial membrane, but in this specimen most of them are gone and the 

 three or four remaining are short and thick, and scarcely reach beyond 

 the free border of the anterior prostomial membrane. Behind the ten- 

 tacles the posterior prostomial fold is low and thick and at the dorsum 

 nearly obsolete. On its posterior face are traces of a few eyes. 



The mouth is a large, wide, transverse slit slightly bent down at the 

 margins, and is bounded below by a low thick lip, and a prominent, 

 broad, truncate process with slightly fimbriated margin springing from 

 the middle of the peristomium. 



Anterior somites are irregularly developed, the second being much 

 larger than the adjacent ones. The second to eleventh somites in- 

 clusive have ventral plates, the glandular areas extending upward to 

 include the setse tufts. The third to the seventh have dorsal glandular 

 areas also, which are separated on each side from the setigerous tuber- 

 cles by a narrow non-glandular space. On the eighth also is a trace of 

 a glandular region with a median break. 



Not the slightest trace of gills exists. At the dorsal margin of III, 




856 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [DeC, 



in line with the setae bundles of the following somites, is a prominent, 

 stiff, erect cirrus on each side. 



Behind the glandular region the segments become much longer, 

 equaling or exceeding their diameter. These walls are very smooth 

 and thin, highly arched above and nearly fiat below, with thick longi- 

 tudinal muscle bands along the ventro-lateral angles. 



There are eleven setigerous somites, IV to XIV inclusive, but on the 

 left side the bundle of IV is missing. Owing to the flatness of the dor- 

 sum of the region back to X the setse tufts rise up nearly erect from the 

 dorso-lateral margins. Though few, the setae are long and, except on 

 XII to XIV, conspicuous. Uncinigerous tori begin on V and. are 

 short and inconspicuous anteriorly, but about XV begin to increase in 

 prominence, and on the posterior segments, while remaining short, 

 project freely from the ventro-lateral longitudinal muscle bands. On 

 the tori of somites V to X the uncini are arranged in one series, on XI 

 to XIV in tw^o apposed series. Each series on the thoracic somites con- 

 tains about 55 uncini, w^hile on posterior somites (XXX) only 40 occur. 



The setae (fig. 14) are slightly curved, delicate, with narrow wings, 

 almost obsolete on one side and on the other frayed out and then ab- 

 ruptly ceasing, leaving a very acute almost whiplash-like tip. The 

 uncini (fig. 15) have the base broadly rounded in front and provided 

 with a prominent triangular process behind. The sinus is narrow, and 

 from its bottom rises a slender process bearing a very indistinct guard. 

 The beak is rather slender and strongly curved, and above it is a very 

 high crest composed usually of five or sometimes of six transverse 

 rows, of about six or seven each, of long curved spines. The abdom- 

 inal uncini have six or seven transverse rows. 



The single specimen is a female filled with large eggs, and is preserved 

 with a fragment of a soft mucous tube with a slight coating of foreign 

 material. 



It was taken at station 4,279, at Kadiak Island, at a depth of 29 

 fathoms and on a bottom of dark gray mud. 



Thelepus hamatus sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 16 to 18.) 



An apparently small species known only from the type, an incom- 

 plete specimen consisting of 31 anterior segments, and measuring 21 

 mm. long and 2.5 mm. in diameter at III, thence gradually diminishing 

 caudally. 



The tentacles number very few, less than 15 on each side, but are so 

 fragile that they could not be safely untangled and the exact number 

 ascertained. In the specimen the longest are 13 mm. long, coarse, thick 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 857 



and deeply folded longitudinally. The prostomial membrane forms a 

 prominent horseshoe-shaped fold or upper lip above the mouth, while 

 its tentacular fold is narrower and bears the tentacles in a nearly contin- 

 uous band around its entire margin. On its posterior face are right and 

 left groups of numerous, rather large, conspicuous, nearly black eyes 

 arranged for the most part in one row and separated by a narrow 

 dorsal space. 



The large mouth is coverd by the upper lip, the inner surface of 

 which bears a prominent grooved longitudinal ridge on each side of the 

 middle line, and is bounded below by a thick slightly bilobed pad within 

 the membranous anterior margin of the peristomium. 



As far as about XX the anterior somites are short, the length not ex- 

 ceeding one-fourth or one-fifth of the width ; those following are about 

 two-thirds as long as wide, none is distinctly annulated, but all are rough 

 and furrowed both above and below. The first four segments are 

 glandular all round ; the others have the thick glandular layer confined 

 to the ventral half, but covering their entire length and extending to 

 and including the setse tufts. At about XVIII the glands disappear 

 from the anterior one-third of the ventral surface also. The dorsum is 

 thin-walled but rugous and constitutes less than one-third of the cir- 

 cumference. 



Two pairs of branchiae are developed and are situated dorso-laterally 

 on II and III. The first consists of six and the second of three detached 

 and independent filaments about as long as the diameter of the body; 

 the area of attachment of the former extending over the entire length of 

 the second segment, while that of the latter is limited to the anterior 

 margin of the same dorso-lateral level of the third segment. 



Setae tufts begin on III and continue on all succeeding segments 

 throughout the length of the specimen. All are small but prominent, 

 little flattened and oblique, and are retractile within pits in the gland- 

 ular layer of the skin. Throughout they are situated at a high level. 

 Uncinigerous tori begin at V. They are all short, never exceeding 

 one-sixth of the ventral interspace, and are separated from the corre- 

 sponding setse tufts by nearly their length. Posteriorly they grow 

 smaller but more prominent. Like the setigerous tubercles they are 

 situated in thin-walled, sunken spots within the glandular area. 



The first seta tuft includes about twelve rather short, acute, slightly 

 curved setae with very narrow wings. In others the setae (fig. 16) are 

 more numerous, longer and more strongly curved. Still farther back 

 in the posterior region they again become fewer. The uncini are 

 arranged in a single series on all somites and number from 40 to 60. 




858 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF . [DeC, 



They bear a close resemblance to ]\Iarenzeller's figures of the iincini of 

 T. cincinnatus (Fabricius), but the height is greater in proportion to the 

 length and the body and beak are more nearly equal in length. Those 

 on the anterior segments usually have two teeth on the vertex of the 

 crest above the beak (fig. 176), but frequently there are three (fig. 17c) 

 or even a fourth small one. The exact arrangement of the teeth in the 

 crest varies, two of the varieties being shown in fig. 17a. Posteri- 

 orly the uncini (fig. 18) are smaller and the number of teeth in a 

 transverse row of the crest usually more numerous. 



No color remains in the specimen and no ova or sperm to indicate 

 the sex. The fragment of tube present is membranous with scattered 

 fragments of stone and siliceous sponge spicules. 



The single specimen comes from station 4.235, at Yes Bay, in Behm 

 Canal, at a depth of 181 fathoms and on a bottom of green mud. 



Amphitrite palmata sp. nov. (Plate XLIV, figs. 19 to 22.) 



Several specimens of this species occur in the collection. They 

 resemble A. affinus very closely in most respects, but differ decidedly 

 from that species in the form of the branchiae, which have no elevated 

 and branched base and no indication of dichotomy among the branches. 



Complete specimens measure from 40 mm. to 88 mm. long, the last 

 being 5 mm. wide across the thorax. The segments number from 62 

 to 64, those from V to XX being setigerous. 



The general form is almost exactly as figured for A. affinus by Malm- 

 gren. Somites II, III and IV present similar slight lateral wings in 

 successively ascending positions. The tentacles are moderately num- 

 erous and have a length of about five times the diameter of the thorax. 

 No eyes can be detected on any of the specimens. The lower lip is 

 square and rather prominent. Swollen glandular areas occur inter- 

 segmentally at the level of the gills on somites V to XIII ; and ventral 

 plates extend from III to XIII inclusive, the first three being very 

 short. All of the segments are rugous and iDiannulate and taper 

 gradually to the pygidium. The anus is a vertical slit surrounded by 

 papillae. 



Most characteristic are the gills (fig. 22) which occur in three pairs 

 on somites II, III and IV. Their bases are exceedingly short, so that 

 the filaments are nearly sessile. They are expanded and flattened and 

 the filaments spread regularly in a palmate fashion. The filaments 

 are slender and when contracted are thrown into tight spiral coils. 

 Full-grown specimens have 13 to 18 on the first, 10 to 12 on the second 

 and 7 to 9 on the third a;ill. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 859 



Small papillte or cirri are found just l^eneath the setigerous tubercles 

 of somites VI, VII and VIII. 



Setae (fig. 19) have very short wings and a prominent fringed terminal 

 pennant with a distinct knee at the place of its origin from the body 

 of the seta. Abdominal uncini (fig. 21) resemble those of A. afjinus 

 quite closely, but those of thoracic tori (fig. 20) differ decidedly in the 

 shape and proportions of the base and the number and arrangement 

 of the teeth on the crest. 



Some of the specimens are colored a nearly uniform reddish-brown, 

 absent, however, from the gills and tentacles; and two are accom- 

 panied by portions of rather fragile tubes of fine mud. 



This species was taken at the following stations : 4,227, Naha Bay, 

 Behm Canal, 62-65 fathoms and on a bottom of dark green mud and 

 fine sand; type locality 4,245, Kasaan Bay, Prince of Wales Island, 

 95-98 fathoms, dark green mud with fragments of shell, rock and 

 sand; 4,253, Stephens Passage, 131 fathoms, rock and broken shells.

coon mountain and its crater, 

 by daniel moreau barringer. 



Foreword. 



In October, 1902, I heard for the first time — in casual conversa- 

 tion with Mr. S, J. Holsinger — of Coon Mountain or Coon Butte and its 

 crater, which is located in the northern part of Ai'izona. He stated 

 to me at the time that he had never seen this remarkable crater, but 

 had heard of it on several occasions, and had heard that quite a large 

 amount of meteoric iron had been found in the immediate vicinity and 

 that some had been found on the inside of the crater, which latter 

 statement was subsequently^ proved to be incorrect. 



I naturally was very incredulous of the theory which, jMr. Holsinger 

 informed me, was held by some of the people living in the neighborhood 

 of Canon Diablo, namely, that this great hole in the earth's surface had 

 been produced by the impact of an iron body falling out of space, if for 

 no other reason than that I realized that the crater must have been 

 examined by members of the United States Geological Survey while 

 making the topographical maps of this region, and in their report they 

 evidently did not accept this theory. 



Nevertheless, the subject continued to interest me so much that 

 upon my return to Philadelphia I determined to speak to my friend, 

 Mr. B. C. Tilghman, in reference to it, because of his general scientific 

 knowledge. This was in the latter part of January, 1903. We de- 

 cided to write to Mr. Holsinger for further information, and upon 

 receipt of this took the necessary steps to locate the mountain under 

 the United States Mineral Land Laws. Since then, between us, Mr. 

 Tilghman and I have collected an astounding array of evidence in 

 favor of the correctness of the above theory of the causation of* this 

 great hole in the earth's surface, and in refutation of the theory 

 adopted by Mr. Gilbert, of the United States Geological Survey, that 

 it was produced by a steam explosion.^

In fact we can now prove that this crater is due to the collision with 

 the earth of an extra-terrestrial body, possibly a small asteroid, which 

 was presumably metallic in nature. 



We do not know, and indeed may never know, whether this great 

 meteor was originally an irregularly shaped fragment or whether it 

 was a spheroid, but we have strong reason to believe that the composi- 

 tion of the exterior was that of nickeliferous iron, containing in minute 

 quantity platinum and iridium. 



Since acquiring possession of the property, we have learned that this 

 meteoric fall has been the subject of many papers and that the com- 

 position of the iron, and the fact that it contains microscopic diamonds, 

 has been well known, upwards of ten tons of iron specimens having 

 been shipped away from this locality; although, singularly enough, 

 the presence of platinum and iridium has not been suspected. The 

 presence of these metals was ascertained for us by ^Ir. H. H. Alexander, 

 of the Globe Smelter, Denver, l^y subjecting the iron and the magnetite 

 (the origin of which we shall attempt to explain hereafter) to the fire 

 assay test, samples of each having been sent to him for the purpose. 

 Their presence has been also confirmed by the very high chemical 

 authority, Dr. J. W. Mallet, F.R.S., of the University of Virginia, whose 

 letter on the subject is herewith submitted.^

August 17, 1905. 

 D. M. Barringer, Esq., Philadelphia. 

 Dear Mr Barringer: 



About a fortnight ago I was at last able to undertake the examination you 

 desired of the residue sent me by Mr. Alexander from solution in dilute hj'dro- 

 chloric acid of 2.5 lbs. of the Canon Diablo meteoric iron, and I now report results: 



I first repeated twice the assay experiments made by Mr. Alexander, and 

 obtained substantially the same results that he did. 



It then seemed to me desirable to apply a method which should not involve any 

 addition of foreign metals (though I have full confidence in the purity of Mr. Alex- 

 ander's lead, gold and silver), and to avoid determination of platinum "by loss." 



I therefore boiled the greater part of the residue sent me by him with a mix- 

 ture of strong hydrochloric and nitric acids as long as there was any action. 

 This was a very tedious affair, the Schreibersite (phosphide of iron and nickel), 

 which formed a large proportion of the residue, being but slowly attacked, and 

 there being a strong tendency to boiling over from sudden, irregular evolution of 

 nitrogen dioxide. The solution obtained was evaporated two or three times 

 with hydrochloric acid, diluted, filtered and treated with a current of sulphuretted 

 hydrogen, first cold and then while heated. This gave a copious precipitate of 

 sulphur (from reduction of ferric to ferrous chloride) colored brownish by the sul- 

 phides of the platinum metals. 



This precipitate was filtered off, well washed with water, dried and burned. 

 The small residue left was then reconverted into clilorides, and the platinum and 

 iridium separated in the usual way, by partial reduction of the iridium salt and 

 precipitation of that of platinum with ammonium chloride. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 563 



It has seemed to Mr. Tilghman and to me to be better for us each to 

 discuss this matter from our separate points of view — he from the point 

 of view of a physicist, chemist and mathematician, and I from the 

 point of view of a geologist. 



The number of arguments which between us we have worked out, 

 in support of the theory that this gigantic hole is an impact crater, will 

 be set forth in the two following papers. It must be remembered that 

 while a great deal of the evidence collected by us is positively in favor 

 of the theory, much of it is negatively so; that is to say it disproves the 

 theory that this great hole is the crater of an ancient volcano, or was 

 produced by an explosion of steam, which latter theory seems to have 

 been adopted by Mr. G. K. Gilbert on what seems to be very insufficient 

 evidence. Perhaps it would be more accurate and just to say that he 

 has adopted this theory because of an inadequate examination of the 

 phenomena at Coon IMountain, or, as it is frequently called, Coon Butte ; 

 for had he examined the surface carefully, it does not seem possible to 

 me that any experienced geo'ogist could have arrived at such a con- 

 clusion. 



Coon Mountain and Its Crater, 



There is to be found in the almost level plain country, about five miles 

 almost due south of Sunshine Station, on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa 



The result represented 3.63 grammes platinum and 14.96 grammes iridium 

 per ton (of 2,000 lbs.) of the original meteoric iron, with probably a trace of 

 rhodium 



I add the following remarks : 



1. Mr. Alexander in using his method undoubtedly dissolved out with aqua 

 regia from his cupelled button not only gold and platinum but some iridium, 

 so that the loss of weight (after deduction of gold added) represented not merely 

 platinum, as he assumed, l3ut in part iridium also. 



2. On tlie other hand, it is not certain that in my process all the iridium is 

 dissolved out from the original material (residue sent me by Mr. Alexander) by 

 aqua regia as used. 



3. My results as to separation of the two platinoid metals are fairly trust- 

 worthy, but would be more so if there had been a larger absolute quantity of 

 material to work on. 



4. It is of course possible that these platinoid metals are not uniformly .dis- 

 tributed in the original meteoric iron. 



Believe me. 



Sincerely yours, 



(Signed) J. W. Mallet. 



From the specimen of Caiion Diablo iron you left for me, with drill holes in it 

 and a memorandum as to drills being blunted and spoiled, I have obtained five 

 excellent microscopic diamonds — quite like those of South Africa in appearance 

 and markings.

Fe Ry., in Coconino county, Arizona, a very remarkable and almost 

 perfectly round crater, differing in many respects, as will be hereafter 

 seen, from any crater on the earth's surface with which I, at least, am 

 familiar. The rocks exposed in this region, and for many miles around 

 in every direction, belong to the Aubrey formation of the Upper Car- 

 boniferous series. These beds are perfectly horizontal, never having 

 been disturbed since they were laid down except by volcanic tremors, 

 which were probably the cause of several small but deep cracks in the 

 vicinity of Canon Diablo gorge and running parallel with it. Erosion 

 has removed the upper strata which overlie these beds elsewhere in the 

 region, so that now the uppermost stratum which is found is red sand- 

 stone, and this exists only as isolated and quite widely separated flat- 

 topped buttes. It is not likely that this stratum was ever of great 

 thickness. The portions of it which are left vary from a few feet to less 

 than fifty feet in thickness. At the place now occupied by Coon 

 Mountain and its crater (for it should be stated that this crater is 

 within a rather low long mountain rising out of the level plain to a 

 height of from 120 to 160 feet, the irregular top of the mountain form- 

 ing the rim of the bowl-shaped crater) this sandstone stratum, at the 

 time the crater was made, probabl}^ existed here as a flat-topped butte 

 of considerable area, not over thirty feet in height aljove the surround- 

 ing limestone plain. The exact locality now occupied by the moun- 

 tain and the crater was no doubt very similar to portions of the present 

 surrounding plain before the event which produced them. These 

 isolated buttes of red sandstone, which are dotted over the plain, 

 probably average from fifteen to twenty feet in thickness. Under- 

 neath this sandstone there are from 200 to 350 feet of yellowish-gray 

 calcareous sandstone, which when eroded and weathered has the ap- 

 pearance of limestone. In fact, this stratum, wdiich is well shown in 

 the neighboring gorge of Canon Diablo, is referred to by the United 

 States Geological Survey as the Aubrey limestone. For the sake of 

 clearness it will hereafter be referred to as limestone. Underneath this 

 limestone there is a stratum of apparently from 800 to 900 feet in 

 thickness, but probably much less,^ of very light gray, almost white, 

 fine-grained sandstone; and underneath this stratum there is a thin 

 stratum of yellow sandstone, the thickness of which is not definitely 



' It is probable that these figures are very excessive and that the true thickness 

 of this sandstone stratum at this point mucli more nearly approximates the 

 thickness given to it in the record of tlie Winona well given l)elow. The record 

 of our bore holes and as. obtained from the surrounding exposures must of 

 necessity be unreliable, for reasons wliich will hereafter appear. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 865 



known. This seems to be the uppermost member of what are known 

 as the "Red Beds/' for underneath this yellow sandstone there is a 

 reddish-brown sandstone, the thickness of which is given by the United 

 States Geological Survey as more than 1,000 feet. The following 

 record of a well driven by the Railroad Company at Winona, less 

 than thirty miles distant in an air line from the crater first men- 

 tioned, shows the thickness of these various strata at that point. 

 It is assumed that the Geological Survey obtained these figures from 

 the Railroad Company, since the figures which they give as to the 

 thickness of these strata, at the place where the A., T. & S. F. Ry. 

 crosses the Canon Diablo gorge, closely approximate the record of the 

 well.* There are no eruptive rocks of any sort in this neighborhood, 

 the nearest eruptive rocks to the so-called crater above referred to 

 being a mountain known as Sunset Mountain about twelve miles in a 

 southeast direction, the Black Mesa in a west and southwest direction 

 about twenty miles distant, and the San Francisco Mountains and the 

 flows therefrom about forty-five to fifty miles distant in a northwest 

 direction. The latter, as is well known, are composed of many vol- 

 canic craters and the material ejected therefrom. Some of these 

 craters are of comparatively recent origin, geologically considered, but 

 presumably of much greater age than Coon Mountain and the crater it 

 contains. The Black Mesa above referred to is supposed to be a flow 

 from the San Francisco craters. In the San Francisco Mountains 

 there are many volcanic cones containing more or less perfect craters. 

 These are true volcanic craters. Such, for instance, is the well-known 

 ' ' Sunset" crater, a few miles north of the Santa F6 Railroad and easily 

 accessible from Flagstaff. I have no hesitancy in saying that there is 

 absolutely no connection between the first mentioned crater, which I 

 shall hereafter attempt to describe, and these volcanic craters. And 

 more than that, there is not a single point of similarity, excepting per- 

 haps that of the round shape of the interior basin. 



As above stated, the crater which is the subject of this paper is to be 

 found in an area composed of level beds of stratified rocks (Carbonifer- 

 ous sandstones, limestones and shales), which extend uninterruptedly,

with the exception of the above volcanic areas, for easily seventy miles 

 in every direction. Generally speaking the same rocks are exposed 

 in the Grand Canon of the Colorado, the canons of the Little Colorado 

 and of the stream known as Canon Diablo, which is distant to the south- 

 west and west only two and one-half miles. The cliffs exposed in this 

 caiion are composed entirely of the upper portion of the limestone bed 

 above referred to, as the caiion does not cut down to the underlying 

 light gray sandstone also referred to above, and the overlying thin red 

 sandstone stratum has been eroded off in this locality. In this crater 

 and around it are to be found nothing but stratified sedimentary rocks 

 or the fragments thereof. Viewed from the railroad across the per- 

 fectly level plain, Coon Mountain presents a very peculiar appearance to 

 anyone accustomed to study the sky line. Such an observer would 

 see a small mountain or butte, about one and a half miles long, rising 

 out of the level plain, the sky line of which (the rim of the crater) is 

 very irregular, the mountain differing widely in this respect as well as in 

 its light color from other mountains in the region, which show the 

 usual rounded appearance and gentle lines produced 1)y erosion, and 

 the dark color produced by the eruptive rocks of which they are com- 

 posed. 



Coon Mountain or Coon Butte, as it is often called, does not suggest 

 to one viewing it, especially at close range, from any direction, the 

 existence within itself of a large crater, approximately 3,800 feet in 

 diameter (its diameter along a north-and-south line passing through it 

 being 3,654 feet, while its east-and-west diameter is 3,808 feet) and 

 approximately 600 feet deep from the rim of the crater to the surface 

 of the interior central plain. It is a fact worthy of mention, but after 

 all just what one would expect when one realizes the cause of its origin, 

 that this mountain presents very much the same view to an observer 

 stationed several miles distant, whether he stands on the north, south, 

 east or west side of the mountain. This so-called mountain has an 

 extreme elevation of about 160 feet above the level of the plain, and an 

 average elevation of about 130 feet. Upon closer examination it is 

 found to be composed to a great extent on its outside slopes of an enor- 

 mous quantity of fragmentary material, which is made up as follows : 

 red sandstone fragments, limestone fragments, white sandstone frag- 

 ments and a few small yellow and brown sandstone fragments; the 

 largest masses probably weighing upwards of 5,000 tons (these are 

 nearly always limestone) down to silica in powder of microscopic fine- 

 ness (pulverized sand grains) which will be described hereafter. I 

 have made no attempt to compute the amount of this fragmentary 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 867 



material, but roughly guess it to be in the neighborhood of 200,000,000 

 tons; perhaps rather less than more. An additional reason for the 

 existence of the elevation known as Coon Butte or Coon Mountain is 

 to be found in the fact that the uppermost strata exposed in the walls 

 of the interior crater dip quaquaversally, or generally speaking in every 

 direction from the exact center of the crater, at an angle usually vary- 

 ing from ten to forty degrees, and in one case from sixty to seventy de- 

 grees. It should be stated, however, that in this case it is evident that a 

 great, presumably wedge-shaped, piece of the material of the cliffs which 

 form the sides of the crater and the rim, has nearly been turned out 

 bodily by the force which produced this enormous hole in the earth's 

 surface. The effect of this would be, of course, to turn the strata 

 nearly on edge at this place. Naturally, this wedge-shaped piece — an 

 expression which is used for want of a better one — lies between two 

 faults, on the other side of each of which the strata dip at a much lower 

 angle, not to exceed perhaps twenty degrees in the one case, that is to 

 the north, and not to exceed five or ten degrees in the other, that is to 

 the southwest. On the west side of the crater the strata are upturned 

 so that they dip at about forty-five degrees west. It is an interesting 

 fact that many large fragments of limestone, which have been hurled 

 -out of the crater, are to be found at least a mile from it ; and if I am 

 not mistaken there are several large fragments, weighing perhaps 

 fifty tons each, which are more than a mile distant from the center of 

 the crater. These fragments, great and small, are distributed con- 

 centrically around the crater, being more abundant near the rim than 

 distant from it. It is worthy of note, however, that the greater 

 number of the larger fragments of the limestone stratum, some of 

 them weighing probably over 5,000 tons, are to be found on the 

 slopes of the mountain outside of the crater, on an east-and-west line 

 passing through the center of the crater. That is to say, there are two 

 places on the rim where these large fragments are most abundant; one 

 almost directly east of the center and the other almost directly west of 

 the center. It is also interesting to see how shattered and cracked 

 many of the exposed limestone fragments are, showing probably that 

 they have been subjected to the concussion from a great blow. These 

 great and small angular blocks of limestone lie in every conceivable 

 position on the slopes of the mountain, many of them standing on end 

 so to speak, that is with the lines of stratification showing a vertical or 

 nearly vertical dip. 



I have made more than ten trips to this locality and have examined 

 almost every foot of the ground around it most carefully, and have 




868 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



failed to find a single piece of eruptive or metamorphosed rock, or any 

 -rock indicative of solfateric activity, which has not in all probability 

 been brought to the locality by Indians or the prehistoric inhabitants 

 of this region. 



The sharp edges of the angular fragments of rock, which have cer- 

 tainly been expelled out of this crater with great force, are indicative 

 of the recent origin of the crater. In fact, I am ready to believe that 

 it is not more than 2,000 or 3,000 years old, and perhaps much younger. 

 Cedars have been found growing on the rim which are upwards of 700 

 years old. Were it not for this fact the evidence afforded by the frac- 

 tured surfaces of the rocks would indicate even a more recent origin.^ 



The interior of the crater can best be likened to a great bowl, except- 

 ing that there is an almost vertical escarpment running around the 

 upper portion of the basin, formed of cliffs composed of limestone and 

 the overlying red sandstone. From the bottom of the limestone 

 stratum, or where the more or less shattered and disintegrated white 

 sandstone begins to be seen underneath the limestone cliffs, a great 

 interior fringe of talus commences, which is composed of angular 

 fragments of red sandstone, limestone and gray or white sandstone. 

 This talus slopes at a very low and, for talus representing the effect of 

 weathering, an unusual, or as I think an impossible, angle toward the 

 interior of the plain ; but before it reaches the center it disappears under- 

 neath stratified sedimentary material which was undoubtedly deposited 

 while the interior of the crater was a lake bottom. There are about 

 seventy feet, and perhaps somewhat more in places, of this material, 

 as has been proved by the shafts and drill holes which have penetrated 

 it. It is composed very largely of wind- and water-borne silica or pul- 

 verized sand grains, in which are found numerous fresh-water shells. 

 There are some layers composed almost entirely of microscopic shells, 

 and in some of these sediments there are to be found great numbers of 

 miscroscopic organisms which have silicious skeletons. There has been 

 no opportunity to submit these fresh-water shells and organisms for 

 examination, but it is intended to have this done at an early date. 

 Underneath this sedimentary material there is to be found a more or 

 less [compact and unknown quantity of pulverized sandstone (silica), 

 containing here and there angular rock fragments or so-called boulders. 

 The upper portion of this sedimentary material forms, with the over- 



* It is possible that the cause of this crater may possess considerable historical 

 interest, as explaining the hitherto unexplained fact that throughout this portion 

 of Arizona there are indisputable evidences that the prehistoric civilization 

 ceased abruptly several thousand years ago, according to the necessarily rough 

 estimates of the time which has elapsed. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 869 



lying accumulations of soil and wind-blown material and a certain 

 amount of talus which for the greater part has been distributed by 

 torrential action, an almost level central plain in the present visible 

 bottom of the crater. Just how far these lacustrine deposits extend 

 toward the cliffs and underneath the talus, which has been brought to 

 its present position by torrential action, has not yet been determined, 

 but enough is known to state quite positively that they cover the greater 

 portion of the surface of the ancient visible bottom of the crater. 

 As above stated, underneath this sedimentary material there is to be 

 found an incredibly large amount of what has been locally termed 

 silica, and which certainly is due to the pulverization of the sandstone 

 strata and the sand grains composing them. This so-called silica (this 

 name will hereafter be used in referring to this material) is almost free 

 from impurities ; several analyses having shown it to contain upwards 

 of 98 and even 99 per cent. SiOj. To be properly understood this silica 

 should be examined under a microscope. When so examined it is 

 found to be composed of broken sand grains ; some of the minute frag- 

 ments being as large as the half of a sand grain, but the vast majority 

 are very much smaller, and many of the fragments are so small as to be 

 invisible under an ordinary lens. Under a strong glass or microscope 

 they have the general appearance of broken pieces of ice, being of every 

 conceivable shape and almost invariably having very sharp edges, and 

 of course being translucent. Much of this so-called silica is so finely 

 pulverized that no grit can be noticed when it is placed between the 

 teeth, and in fact can be truthfully described as being an impalpable 

 powder. At many places this silica is less finely subdivided than has 

 been described above and is distinctly gritty when placed between the 

 teeth ; but at no place has there been found any particle of it which is 

 larger than one of the small sand grains which go to make up the strata 

 in which the crater is found. Without further explanation it can be 

 stated definitely that this silica is nothing more or less than pulverized 

 sandstone. How many million tons of this material there are it would 

 be impossible to estimate. It composes a great part of the enormous 

 rim, over three miles in length measured around the base of the moun- 

 tain, in which the crater is situated. The amount of it within the 

 crater is absolutely unknown; for it has been found by means of drill 

 holes to a depth of more than 850 feet. At places both on the ex- 

 terior of the rim and in the interior of the crater, underneath the sedi- 

 mentary deposits, it is found admixed with a small percentage of lime 

 carbonate, which admixture can of course be readily understood when 

 it is remembered that there is shown in the walls of the crater a calcare- 




870 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC. 



ous sandstone (herein referred to as limestone for the sake of conveni- 

 ence) which has a thickness of some 250 to 350 feet. If one digs down 

 through the surface soil a foot or more, almost anywhere on the out- 

 side of the rim, among the angular fragments which have been thrown 

 out of the hole he will come into this silica, and a great number of 

 trenches and several shafts have shown it to continue downward cer- 

 tainly to the solid or rather more or less shattered rock upon which 

 all of the fragmentary material forming the rim rests. One of these 

 shafts, almost at the base of the mountain and near the surrounding 

 plain, is forty-eight feet in depth. However there are, especially on the 

 southern side of the mountain, several dry washes, w'here this almost 

 snow-white silica has been exposed for hundreds of feet in length and in 

 places to a depth of upwards of ten feet. It is difficult to understand 

 how this exposure could escape the eye of any careful geologist making 

 a circuit of the crater. If noticed by him it would certainly seem that 

 he would have examined it and ascertained its nature. Having done 

 this, it w^ould seem that he would have been impelled to make a few 

 shallow trenches at different places around the crater, in order to 

 determine how much of this material there was. Having then proved 

 it to exist on all sides of the crater in enormous quantities, it would 

 seem to me that he could not have explained its presence in any 

 other way than that which we have adopted; especially in view of 

 the fact of there being so much corroborative evidence of even a more 

 convincing character. Briefly, it seems to me impossible that this 

 silica could be produced by volcanic action, or by a steam explosion, 

 and I assume that it could be produced only by the pulverizing effect 

 of an almost inconcei-v ably great blow. It should be stated that the 

 silica on the outside of the rim, and to a less extent underneath 

 the sedimentary material in the bottom of the crater, is plentifully 

 admixed with broken fragments of red sandstone, limestone and 

 white sandstone of all sizes within the limits mentioned and sharply 

 angular shapes. It also should be mentioned that the many cuts 

 and shafts (over fifty in all) which we have caused to be made on 

 the outside of the crater, have shown that the silica carrying with it 

 these broken fragments, especially those of smaller size, has evidently 

 welled out of the crater almost like lifiuid mud, or perhaps, more accur- 

 ately, like flour when it is poured out of a barrel. It is an interesting 

 fact that it often contains innumerable angular fragments of sandstone 

 in which the grains of sand (some pulverized into silica, some whole 

 and unbroken) are no longer coherent, an effect which we have assumed 

 has been produced by tremendous concussion. It would seem that 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 871 



these fragments, before they disintegrated entirely, were caught in the 

 flow of siHca and carried gently outward and deposited where they are 

 found at present, surrounded by the almost snow-white silica. As the 

 sandstone is itself often very white, the outline of these fragments is 

 not readily distinguished in the sides of the open cuts, until they have 

 been exposed for some time to the weather. However, it is to be remem- 

 bered that there are in the silica, as far as we have explored it with 

 trenches and shafts, great numbers of perfectly solid coherent sharply 

 angular pieces of sandstone and limestone, as well as of the incoherent 

 fragments. So far as it can be observed the white sandstone stratum, 

 where it is exposed beneath the limestone cliffs inside the crater, is in 

 this same incoherent condition. It is as if it had received a tremendous 

 blow, the concussion from which caused the solid sandstone to disin- 

 tegrate and become almost like compacted sand, since it can in many 

 instances be dug out and crumbled by the fingers. The effect of this 

 has been of course to cause the sandstone stratum at this point to 

 occupy more space than it previously occupied. The result of this has 

 undoubtedly been the raising of the superimposed limestone and red 

 sandstone strata, causing them to show, when viewed from the interior 

 of the crater, several anticlinal and synclinal folds, and to dip out- 

 wardly from the center of the crater, and in this way assisting in 

 forming the elevation locally known as Coon Mountain, which has 

 already been described. 



No order is to be observed in the distribution of the angular frag- 

 ments either within or without the crater, excepting that which I have 

 already referred to, that the greatest amount of large limestone frag- 

 ments, which it should be remembered is the most coherent rock of the 

 series and the one which has most successfully resisted disintegration, 

 is to be found almost due east and due west of the center of the crater; 

 and also excepting that at certain places there are to be seen spurts of 

 one kind of solid fragments, for example white sandstone, aggregating 

 in amount thousands of tons, and extending from the rim of the crater 

 almost down to its base. 



These tongues of fragmentary material, which seem to have been 

 spurted out of the crater with such force as to displace everything which 

 they met, are very interesting ; especially those of the white sandstone, 

 some of the fragments of which exhibit very beautiful examples of 

 cross-bedding. The lowest members of the series which was ejected 

 are the red sandstone and the overlying yellow sandstone, small pieces of 

 which are to be found in relatively small quantities on the surface of 

 the southern and southeastern portion of the rim. These are almost 




872 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



certainly from the upper portion of the Red Beds already referred 

 to. 



This brings me to describe more particularly the rim itself. On first 

 examination it would seem that the fragmentary material and silica are 

 almost equally distributed on all sides of the crater. Upon closer 

 examination, however, it is found that there is vastly more of it to the 

 southwest, south and southeast than to the northeast, north and north- 

 west. It also will be observed that the fragmentary material is much 

 more comminuted to the southwest, south and southeast than it is on 

 the opposite sides of the crater. It will also be observed that the 

 limestone cliffs on the interior of the crater are much more shattered to 

 the southwest and south than anywhere else, and the limestone bed 

 itself is raised higher, and to the southeast is to be found the great 

 wedge-shaped piece of the material forming the cliffs and rim, which 

 was turned over and seems to have been near to going out bodily. It 

 will also be observed that the lowest point on the crater is on the north 

 rim, somewhat to the west of a north-and-south line passing through it; 

 and finally the ejected fragments, of ten tons or more in weight, are 

 found distributed over the plain at a greater distance south and south- 

 east of the crater than anj^where else. From all of these facts, the infer- 

 ence is unavoidable that the cause which produced the crater acted 

 with somewhat more violence in a southwest, south and southeast 

 direction than in the opposite direction. 



It would be possible to extend this description of the crater to a 

 much greater length ; but I hope that in the above I have stated most 

 of the salient facts which would impress the careful observer. Now, 

 there are only three conceivable causes for such a tremendous disturb- 

 ance of the horizontal strata at this point, and I will take them up 

 separately. 



I. An extremely violently acting volcano. This can be set aside as 

 being impossible inasmuch — 



First: No lava is to be found, or any other volcanic rock, for many 

 miles in any direction. Nor is there to be seen any sulphur, which is 

 found in most volcanic craters of recent origin. 



Second : I assume that huge fragments of rock, weighing perhaps 

 upwards of fifty tons, could not have been expelled from the crater 

 and deposited a mile or more distant from its center by volcanic action, 

 in the absence of other numerous and indisputable facts to show that 

 a volcano existed at this place. Moreover, any stone which has been 

 hurled from a volcanic crater through the agency of steam is usually of 

 igneous origin. 



Third : We know absolutely the series of rocks at this point, and this 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 873 



series has been described in the first part of this paper. We also know 

 that only the uppermost strata have been hurled out of this hole by 

 some terrific force. Briefly, it Tvould seem to me to be impossible that 

 any geologist carefully examining the region could reach the conclusion 

 that this is a volcanic crater, or in any way produced by volcanic 

 agencies. 



II. A steam explosion. This is the theory which seems to have been 

 adopted by the United States Geological Survey to account for this 

 remarkable crater, on the report of one of its members, Mr. Grove Karl 

 Gilbert, and his associates.^ To me it seems incredible that they could 

 have adopted this explanation of the crater and its surrounding phe- 

 nomena, if they had carefully examined the surface as above described, 

 for the following reasons : 



First : Such a violent paroxysmal outbm-st of steam as they assume 

 in order to account for Coon Mountain and its crater is, to the best of my 

 knowledge, unrecorded, unless perhaps in connection with some great 

 volcano, and even there its force, I assume, has been, with few excep- 

 tions, less than the force expended here ; and in such volcanic manifes- 

 tations there were a number of such explosions, not merely one. 



Second: The vast amount of steam required to do the amount of 

 work accomplished at this place could only be stored up in regions of 

 present or recent volcanic activity. There is no evidence that this has 

 ever been such a region. 



Third: As suggested above, it is inconceivable to me that there 

 could have been, even in such a region, much less in a region of undis- 

 turbed stratified rocks, such a single great steam explosion, before 

 which and after which all was quiet. 



Fourth : I assume that such an explosion would not have produced 

 the beautifully round crater which we have here; and, moreover, it 

 seems certain that the country round about would be seamed for miles 

 with cracks and fissures, perhaps more or less radial, through which in 

 aU probability steam would have ascended for many centuries. No- 

 thing of the sort has been found here. It is certain that the crater 

 was made in an instant of time, after which all was as quiet as befo're. 

 Any one visiting the locality is impressed by the many evidences of 

 this fact. It is also certain that the crater is very recent, compara- 

 tively little or no erosion having taken place since it was made. The 

 evidences of this are to be found on every side. If there had been 



"See Thirteenth Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Sur., Part I, p. 98, and Fourteenth Ann. 

 Rep. U. S. Geol. Sur., Part I, p. 187. Also Science, N. S., Vol. Ill, p. 1, and 

 Chamberlin and Salisbury's Geology (1904), Vol. I, p. 569. 




874 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



much erosion, such as must have taken place in order to account for 

 the great amount of tahis which is to be ol^served on the inside of the 

 crater, supposing it to have accumulated in the usual way, the crater 

 would certainl}' not be as round as it is. If originally round, it would 

 certainly have been greatly deformed by the process. It could not 

 weather round. It is perfectly clear that this is contrary to any known 

 mode of action of erosion. Therefore it is certain that the talus did 

 not accumulate in the usual way, and that its presence and distribution 

 must be explained on some other theory than that of weathering. 

 This view receives further support from the fact that the very low 

 angle (about twenty degrees from horizontal) which the upper portion 

 of the talus on the interior of the crater makes in its descent from the 

 base of the almost perpendicular cliffs, is a very unusual one. 



Fifth : Granting that such a single violent steam explosion is not an 

 absurb hypothesis, it would seem that on this hypothesis there would 

 be abundant evidences of solfateric activity within and without the 

 crater, especially in the immediate vicinity; such as redeposited or 

 secondary silica, carbonate of lime and other minerals which are 

 usually deposited b}" hot spring action. These minerals would cer- 

 tainly be found within the crater and in the cracks which, under this 

 hypothesis, it would seem should be found traversing the horizontal 

 stratified rocks forming the plain on the outside of the crater. Neither 

 the cracks nor the minerals are to be found. In short, there is no evi- 

 dence of any sort at or near this spot of solfateric action. 



Sixth : If a steam explosion had formed this crater, it is inconceiv- 

 able to me that it would not have thrown up rocks from a greater depth 

 than that represented by the three uppermost strata, together with a 

 very small portion of the upper part of the Red Beds which underlie 

 them. Nothing would seem to be more certain than that the greater 

 portion of these Red Beds and the great Carboniferous series of strata 

 extending thousands of feet under them, as exposed by the Grand 

 Canon of the Colorado, only seventy miles distant, are undisturbed 

 In other words, the series of strata at Coon Mountain have not been 

 disturbed, at least to the extent of being thrown out, for a greater 

 depth than the upper portion of the Red Beds, geologically speaking, 

 or about 1,200 feet more or less — perhaps as much as 1,300 feet — below 

 the present surface of the plain. 



Seventh: A steam explosion I assume could not have pulverized the 

 individual sand grains, as they have been pulverized here, and produced 

 as a result the miUions of tons of ' ' silica ' ' which exists on the inside of 

 the crater and on the outside of the rim as already described. It is not 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. S75 



conceivable to me, as I have already stated, that this material could 

 have been produced in the quantities in which we find it in any other 

 way than by a heavy blow. 



Additional Argument AGAINST the Theory of a Steam Explosion. 



Eighth: Even if a steam explosion could have produced the silica 

 dust it would have blown, as Mr. Tilghman points out (see page 899), 

 such finely divided material high into the atmosphere, after the man- 

 ner of the great Krakatoa explosion in 1883, and a very large portion 

 of this material would certainly have been carried away by air cur- 

 rents and finally deposited far from the crater, instead of in the 

 crater or on the exterior slopes of the mountain immediately sur- 

 rounding it, where finely pulverized material is distributed in enormous 

 quantities in such a manner as to warrant the belief that it and the 

 rock fragments contained in it behaved not unlike a liquid when they 

 were expelled by some force out of the crater. Again, the dust or 

 minute particles or filaments of volcanic glass expelled from the vol- 

 cano of Krakatoa were not only certainly of igneous origin, but when 

 examined under the microscope were in every case found to be more 

 or less round in shape, instead of being sharply angular particles of 

 crystalline quartz, due, as is safely assumed, to the disintegration or 

 rather pulverization of sand grains. 



Since we have come into possession of the property we have found 

 several thousand pieces, in all something over a ton, of various sized 

 fragments of meteoric iron, the largest weighing as I remember 225 

 pounds, down to pieces weighing much less than an ounce or only a 

 few grains. These meteoric iron specimens (known to the scientific 

 world as the Canon Diablo siderites) are so well known that I shall not 

 attempt to describe them. The following analysis by Messrs. Booth, 

 Garrett and Blair, of Philadelphia, may be taken as representing the 

 general composition of these irons : Si 0.047 ; S 0.004 ; P 0.179 ; C 0.417 ; 

 Ni 7.940; Fe 91.396; total 99.983. In the present discussion it is far 

 more interesting to state that they have been found more or less con- 

 centrically distributed around the crater and to an extreme distance, 

 so far as we know, of two and one-half miles from it, a few small speci- 

 mens having been found in Canon Diablo gorge. It is a remarkable 

 fact that these so-called ' ' irons ' ' (to distinguish them from the so-called 

 "iron shale") are ver}^ angular in shape, indicating by their fracture 

 that they may have been violently torn off or burned from similar ma- 




874 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



much erosion, such as must have taken place in order to account for 

 the great amount of tahis which is to l^e olDserved on the inside of the 

 crater, supposing it to have accumulated in the usual way, the crater 



Sixth : If a steam explosion had formed this crater, it is inconceiv- 

 able to me that it would not have thrown up rocks from a greater depth 

 than that represented by the three uppermost strata, together with a 

 very small portion of the upper part of the Red Beds which underlie 

 them. Nothing would seem to be more certain than that the greater 

 portion of these Red Beds and the great Carboniferous series of strata 

 extending thousands of feet under them, as exposed by the Grand 

 Canon of the Colorado, only seventy miles distant, are undisturbed 

 In other words, the series of strata at Coon Mountain have not been 

 disturbed, at least to the extent of being thrown out, for a greater 

 depth than the upper portion of the Red Beds, geologically speaking, 

 or about 1,200 feet more or less — perhaps as much as 1,300 feet — below 

 the present surface of the plain. 



Seventh : A steam explosion I assume could not have pulverized the 

 individual sand grains, as they have been pulverized here, and produced 

 as a result the millions of tons of "silica" which exists on the inside of 

 the crater and on the outside of the rim as alreadv described. It is not 




1905.] NATURAL SCIE.XCES OF PHILADELPHIA. S75 



conceivable to me, as I have already stated, that this material could 

 have been produced in the quantities in which we find it in any other 

 way than by a heavy blow. 



III. The impact of an extra-terrestrial body. 



I shall attempt now to describe briefly such facts as are evident to 

 any geologist making an examination of the region which furnish strong 

 affirmative evidence that this crater could have been made only by an 

 extra-terrestrial body falling out of space and moving at great speed. 

 Something between ten and fifteen tons of meteoric iron have been 

 shipped away from this locality, most of it going to the various museums 

 of the world. It is a fact, so far as I know, that none of the "iron 

 shale" or magnetic iron oxide, which will be described hereafter, is to 

 be found in any of these museums; why I cannot understand, for the 

 scientific interest which attaches to it is very great. It is probably 

 not generally known that by far the greater portion of the meteoric 

 iron which has been shipped from this locality has been found lying 

 on the plain immediately surrounding the crater, and much of it has 

 been found on the rim itself. At Caiion Diablo a merchant, Mr. F. 

 W. Volz, tells me he has shipped nearly ten tons of this iron, and he 

 also tells me that before he came to the country a merchant from 

 Winslow shipped perhaps half as much. Both of these merchants 

 hired Mexicans to look for iron specimens in the neighborhood of the 

 crater. These men discovered several pieces weighing from 600 to 

 over 1,000 pounds. 



Since we have come into possession of the property we have found 

 several thousand pieces, in all something over a ton, of various sized 

 fragments of meteoric iron, the largest weighing as I remember 225 

 pounds, down to pieces weighing much less than an ounce or only a 

 few grains. These meteoric iron specimens (known to the scientific 

 world as the Canon Diablo siderites) are so well known that I shall not 

 attempt to describe them. The following analysis by Messrs. Booth, 

 Garrett and Blair, of Philadelphia, may be taken as representing the 

 general composition of these irons : Si 0.047 ; S 0.004 ; P 0.179 ; C 0.417 ; 

 Ni 7.940; Fe 91.39G; total 99.983. In the present discussion it is far 

 more interesting to state that the}' have been found more or less con- 

 centrically distributed around the crater and to an extreme distance, 

 so far as we know, of two and one-half miles from it, a few small speci- 

 mens having been found in Canon Diablo gorge. It is a remarkable 

 fact that these so-called ' ' irons ' ' (to distinguish them from the so-called 

 "iron shale") are very angular in shape, indicating by their fracture 

 that they may have been violently torn off or burned from similar ma- 




876 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



terial. Some of them contain holes or cavities which were probably 

 once occupied by nodules of troilite (sulphide of iron). Such nodules 

 are beautifully shown by sawing through some of the larger specimens 

 in the Ward and other collections. When exposed to the action of 

 the atmosphere these have oxidized, leaving the cavities they had 

 occupied. Occasionally some of the specimens have a noticeable 

 amount of iron oxide or shale adhering to them, but as a rule they are 

 very free from this. They are usually covered, however, with a very 

 thin film of iron oxide, which may be easily rubbed off with a wire 

 brush if the specimen has been previously heated. When this is done 

 their appearance would indicate that they may have been torn or 

 burned from presumably similar material. 



It is a fact worthy of note that so far none of these specimens of 

 meteoric iron have been found at any depth beneath the surface. 

 They are usually lying on the surface or partially or wholly covered by 

 the merely superficial soil, and are distributed, as already stated, more 

 or less concentrically around the crater, most of the small specimens 

 being found, however, to the north and northeast. That there are 

 great numbers of them contained in the thin soil overlying the solid 

 limestone composing the level plain on all sides of the mountain is 

 proven by the fact that we have found several specimens, from seven 

 pounds to twenty-seven pounds in weight, so imbedded in digging a 

 trench for a pipe line from Canon Diablo gorge to the crater. They 

 have not been found in the numerous cuts or shafts which have been 

 made in the silica. Four of them, weighing three or four pounds each, 

 have been found on the interior of the crater, and, so far as I know, these 

 are the only iron specimens which have been found inside of the crater. 

 These were found above the cliffs already described. Considerable 

 "iron shale" has also been found inside the crater, among the talus at 

 the base of the cliffs. I shall propose hereafter a possible explanation 

 of the fact why these irons are found only on the surface. It is also 

 worthy of note, as already stated, that we have found more of the smaller 

 irons, on or in the surface soil, on the north and northeastern portion 

 of the rim than in other places. 



Now there have been found abundantly distributed around the 

 rim, and especially on and in its northern portion, and nearby on the 

 plain, very large quantities, probably aggregating a ton or more in 

 weight, of magnetic oxide of iron. This is so abundantly distributed 

 over the northern surface of the rim and over the surrounding plain, 

 and is so apparent to the casual observer, that it seems wonderful 

 to me that Mr. Gilbert and his associates did not make any reference 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 877 



to it in their report. It is certainly different from any substance in 

 nature with which I am famihar, and had they taken the trouble to 

 have it analyzed they would have found that the large pieces almost 

 invariably contain nickel (certainly in all the specimens examined) 

 to the same extent, proportionately speaking, as it is found in the 

 Canon Diablo meteoric iron, from which this magnetic iron oxide was 

 no doubt produced. However, if they had merely broken open some 

 of the larger pieces of this magnetic iron oxide, which it seems to me 

 they could not have failed to see, they would have observed in some 

 of the specimens the characteristic green hydroxide of nickel. The 

 iron oxide was produced, as I assume, by the heat generated from 

 friction while the great iron meteor passed through the earth's 

 atmosphere. As above stated, it has been determined for us that 

 the larger pieces of this so-called "iron shale" contain invariably 

 iron, nickel, iridium and platinum in the same relative proportion 

 (remembering that two are in the form of oxide while the others are 

 in the metallic state) as they are found in the iron from which this 

 material was separated. In the very minute pieces of shale the nickel 

 has been leached out to a greater or less extent. For the sake of clear- 

 ness and because of the peculiar laminated structure, I shall hereafter 

 refer to this magnetic oxide of iron as "iron shale," adopting the local 

 name by which it is known. This iron shale is very much more mag- 

 netic than the original metallic meteoric iron, which in some speci 

 mens is only feebly so. 



It should be stated in this connection that the surface of the sur- 

 rounding country for perhaps several miles, concentrically around the 

 crater, contains minute particles of this iron shale, either in the shape 

 of fragments or as spherules. It is found everywhere in the vicinity 

 of the crater, on the rim and on the outside plain. We have assumed 

 that these small particles once constituted a portion of the great lumin- 

 ous tail of the meteoric body which, in our belief, by its collision with 

 the earth made the crater. 



Having observed all these things, containing as they do many argu- 

 ments in favor of the theory that this great hole in the plain was pro- 

 duced by the impact of a body falling out of space, and against the 

 theory that it was produced by either volcanic action or by a steam 

 explosion, it naturally suggested itself to us to endeavor to prove 

 absolute synchronism of the two events, namely, the falling of a very 

 great meteor on this particular spot and the formation of this crater. 

 The easiest method of doing this, which at once suggested itself to us, 

 was to have a number of open cuts made through the silica and rock 




878 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



fragments on the outside of the rim, and to sink a number of shallow 

 shafts through this material, in order to find if possible pieces of the 

 meteor overlaid by and thoroughly admixed with the rock fragments and 

 silica which certainly came from great depths in the adjacent hole. 

 Numbers of these cuts were made before finding the objects of our 

 search, but at last we began to find them and now we have found 

 nearly one hundred pieces of meteoric material, some of them as much 

 as fifty pounds in weight, a number of feet beneath the surface in the 

 silica, overlaid and underlaid in no particular order by the various 

 kinds of rock fragments described above, namely, white sandstone, 

 limestone and red sandstone. In one case that I remember we found 

 a large piece of meteoric oxidized material or "iron shale" about six 

 feet beneath the surface in the silica, directly underneath an angular 

 fragment, several feet in diameter, of red sandstone. On the top of 

 this red sandstone was a piece of limestone, and on top of the limestone 

 was a still larger piece of white sandstone. I merely mention this case 

 as it is interesting to reflect that the white sandstone comes from a 

 depth of at least about 400 feet below the surface, and yet it is found 

 on top of the red sandstone fragment (the surface rock) and the lime- 

 stone fragment which, when the geological order of the rocks is con- 

 sidered, lie above it. However, the most interesting piece of work 

 in this connection which we have done is to be found in one of the shafts 

 on the rim, which shaft is forty-eight feet deep. In this shaft we found 

 vertically one above the other no less than seven quite large specimens 

 of meteoric material or iron shale; the first one being found twelve 

 feet beneath the surface, and the last one being found twenty-seven 

 feet beneath the surface, underneath a large fragment of red sandstone. 

 These pieces were from a pound to probably thirty pounds in weight. 

 On top of the uppermost specimen, and at varying distances between it 

 and the other specimens found in this shaft, there was the usual ad- 

 mixture of silica, white sandstone fragments, limestone and red sand- 

 stone fragments. On no conceivable theory other than the one which 

 we have adopted can the facts above described be explained.^ 



I have used the words "meteoric material" because this material 

 is somewhat unlike any which up to that time had been found on the 

 surface. Such material has, however, since been found on the surface, 



' Since the above was written j\Ir. Tilghman lias informed me that lie has b}' 

 means of a small magnetic separator found distributed through samples of silica, 

 taken from deposits on the slopes of the rim, an appreciable amount of metallic 

 iron in the form of very minute particles and scales which are covered by mag- 

 netic oxide of iron. These of necessity are meteoric in nature. They have been 

 found by him in silica which was taken from several feet beneath the surface. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 879 



several large specimens, one weighing over 200 pounds and others 

 over 100 pounds, having been found nearly a mile west of the crater, 

 and many small ones distributed around it, generally to the northeast, 

 north and northwest. This material is usually roughly globular or 

 oval in shape, the outside having been converted into hydrated oxide 

 of iron, while the interior is usually magnetic oxide of iron, showing 

 when broken open in nearly every instance the green hydroxide of 

 nickel. In a number of instances, however, these so-called "shale 

 balls" (I again adopt the local name) are found to contain a solid iron 

 center. We have some specimens where these iron centers probably 

 weigh as much as twenty to thirty pounds, the total weight of the 

 shale ball being considerably more than this. The magnetic oxide 

 which surrounds the iron center usually presents a more or less lami- 

 nated appearance, and I assume therefore that much of the so-called iron 

 shale found on the surface, as small flat or slightly curved pieces or 

 thick scale, from an inch to six inches in length and from one-sixteenth 

 inch to several inches in thickness, has resulted from the alteration of 

 shale balls, the iron in the great majority of the cases where these were 

 small or were detached from the meteor in the upper atmosphere 

 having had time to be entirely converted into magnetic oxide. There 

 is such a great similarity of appearance that this inference is to me 

 unavoidable, and I have recently noticed that the pieces of laminated 

 magnetic iron oxide are often grouped, especially where they have 

 been found on the outside plain some distance away from the crater, 

 as if a shale ball, or a piece of metallic iron which was once covered 

 by magnetic oxide of iron, had fallen on this spot and the magnetic 

 oxide of iron had been disintegrated, either by the force of the fall or 

 afterwards by ordinary atmospheric agencies.^ It is worthy of note 

 that the flat or slightly curved pieces of iron shale are found, like the 

 iron specimens, only on the surface or in the surface soil, and to date 

 at least have not been found admixed with the silica and rock fragments 

 on the outside of the rim, as the shale balls are frequently found. 



This brings me to attempt an explanation of tlie fact that these 

 so-called shale balls are to be found beneath the surface on the outside 

 of the rim, and admixed with the fragmentary material which was 

 certainly expelled from the crater, to a proven depth of tw^enty-seven 

 feet, and that the angular pieces of meteoric iron have been found up to 

 date only on the surface or in the shallow soil which overlies the rock 



* It may easily be, however, that pieces of metaUic iron were found at some 

 of these spots and taken away by the merchants who made a business of collecting 

 these specimens for sale to museums, etc. See footnote 9.

fragments and the silica, which forms part of the rim, or on the sur- 

 rounding limestone plain. 



On April 11, 1904, it was my good fortune to observe, while at 

 Pearce, Arizona, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, a very 

 brilliant meteor. This same meteor was observed at Tucson, Arizona, 

 by Mr. Holsinger, who had been in charge of our exploratory work for 

 some time previous to this. He was at the time over seventy miles 

 distant from Pearce in an air line. It is a source of much regret that 

 the sun was shining at the time, for otherwise the spectacle would have 

 been a most brilliant and instructive one. As it was, however, the 

 meteor was so large and so brilliant that the following facts could be 

 most clearly determined : The head of the meteor was blue-white in 

 color; from this head there seemed to dart from time to time, and almost 

 from the moment the meteor became visible, many jets of bluish-colored 

 light. Behind the meteor was a glorious comet-like tail, the color of 

 which was generally yellow. From behind the meteor and out of this 

 tail there appeared from time to time, and after the meteor had been 

 visible for an appreciable length of time, great flaming drops, not 

 unlike drops of burning tar. These rapidly fell behind the meteor, 

 being distanced by it. In shape they were, generally speaking, some- 

 what like a gourd, with the small ends, which as I remember seemed to 

 bend slightly downward, pointing toward the rapidly receding meteor. 

 I counted as many as five of these drops. Mr. Holsinger thought he 

 saw more than five. 



Bearing in mind what I have related above, I shall now offer an ex- 

 planation of the difference in distribution of the pieces of metallic 

 meteoric iron and the so-called shale balls, realizing fully, however, that 

 in the first place not enough work has been done to state with positive- 

 ness that no large pieces of iron are to be found in the fragmentary 

 material forming in great part the slopes of the mountain, and in the 

 second place that the explanation which I offer may be proved to be an 

 erroneous one. I am inclined to believe that many of the thousands 

 of pieces of metallic meteoric iron which have been found distributed 

 around Coon Mountain, and which are generally known by the name of 

 the Canon Diablo siderites, were pieces that were torn loose from the 

 surface of the meteor when it entered the earth's atmosphere by the 

 violent expansion strains set up because of the intense coldness of the 

 main body of the meteor, which of course was cooled to the temper- 

 ature of outer space, and the intense heat immediately generated upon 

 the entrace of the meteor into the earth's atmosphere. This would 

 explain the darts of light which Mr. Holsinger and I saw going out of 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 881 



the front of the meteor above referred to, from almost the instant the 

 meteor became visible.^ These fragments would naturally soon fall 

 behind the meteor, and in the case which is the subject of this paper 

 probably reached the earth after the collision had taken place and all 

 of the material had been thrown out from the crater produced by the 

 impact. The same would be true of the first "shale balls" to be 

 detached, the origin of which, it seems to me, can be explained as 

 follows. As the front surface became more heated it is possible that 

 fewer of these irons would be thrown off, and almost certain that some 

 of the iron would be melted and would naturally run back to the sides 

 or to the rear surface of the meteor, from which from time to time it 

 would be detached. This burning iron would then drop behind, as in 

 the case of the meteor observed by Mr. Holsinger and myself, and form 

 the shale balls above referred to. On this theory the laminated struc- 

 ture which I have spoken of is possibly due to the fact that the melted 

 iron ran back over the meteor to its rear surface, or at least to its sides, 

 and was detached therefrom in a pasty condition. This would seem to 

 offer an explanation of the five flaming drops which I saw falling be- 

 hind the meteor in April, 1904, and why they were not seen until the 

 meteor had been visible for an appreciable length of time. 



These shale balls probably contimied to drop off from the great 

 Canon Diablo meteor, referred to in this paper, until the very moment 



' Since writing the above it has occurred to the author that the pieces of metaUic 

 iron, and the pittings known as "thumb marks" which they show, are due to the 

 very high temperature developed by friction against compressed air in passing 

 through the earth's atmosphere. Dr. Mallet has confirmed this, and points out 

 that in the case of iron meteorites this temperature would of course be still fur- 

 ther raised by burning. He has also told me that this is a commonly accepted 

 theory of the cause of these characteristic pittings. The effect of this furious 

 burning, produced by the friction against the compressed air ahead of the flying 

 iron meteor, would probably be to make great irregular cavities or furrows on its 

 surface, as in the case of the 14-ton Willamette meteorite described by Mr. Henry 

 A. Ward in the Proceedings of the Rochester Academy of Science, Vol. 4, pp. 137-149, 

 plates 13-18. Whether the spaces represented by such cavities or furrows were 

 once partly filled with nodules of troilite is not of importance in this connection. 

 Having this action in mind it can readily be seen how these furrows or cavities in 

 meeting might cause unconsumecl pieces of metallic iron to be liberated, which 

 would then fall behind the main body of the meteor and still burning reach the 

 earth after the collision. Not only "thumb marks" but so-called "ring" me- 

 teorites are perfectly explainable on this theory. It receives very strong support 

 from certain iron specimens which have recently been found by us (and since this 

 paper was written) in the trench for the pipe line between Cafion Diablo gorge 

 and the crater. To these specimens when fovmd a large amount of magnetic oxide 

 of iron or iron shale was still firmly attached, and occupied the "thumb mark" 

 pittings on the specimens as well as being adherent to the more or less flat sur- 

 faces. When it is found in the pittings, generally referred to by the term of 

 "thumb marks," it is distinctly shaly in character and is seen to curve upward 

 from the bottom of the cavity. There is much to recommend this theory, but 

 may there not be truth in both this theory and in the one just mentioned?

of collision. It is very natural, therefore, to conclude that some of 

 them must have been caught before they reached the surface of the 

 earth by the outgoing rock fragments and silica which poured out of 

 the hole at the moment of collision. They were doubtless all burning 

 fiercely at this moment, and would have continued to burn, like those 

 which were detached in the upper atmosphere, until all of the iron was 

 converted into magnetic iron oxide, had enough oxygen been present 

 to produce this result. However, some of them seem to have been 

 smothered out when covered up by the silica and the rock fragments 

 included in it. This would perfectly explain why some of them have 

 iron centers and some of them do not possess this peculiar feature, 

 and why the pieces of iron shale continued to rain down for some mo- 

 ments after the collision. An interesting fact which is perhaps worthy 

 of note is, that these iron centers nearly always show a peculiar exuda- 

 tion of drops of moisture, often colored green, partly perhaps from the 

 presence of nickel. This exudation. Dr. Mallet explains to me, is due 

 to the presence of chloride of iron. It is singular, however, that only 

 one of the pieces of meteoric iron which we have, one of those which 

 was found in the trench for the pipe line and is referred to in foot- 

 note 9, exhibits this peculiarity, it being confined to the so-called iron 

 centers, Avhich have only been found in the shale balls which were 

 entirely covered and surrounded by silica and rock fragments. 



During the many visits which I have paid to this remarkable spot, 

 I have made a most thorough search for any other stone than the sand- 

 stone and limestone fragments above described, I have found a 

 number of pieces of flint and some pieces of eruptive rock, but in every 

 case there was every reason to believe they had been brought there by 

 Indians who visited this locality, as many of them were pieces of 

 ' ' matates, ' ' in which the Indians and prehistoric inhabitants of this 

 country ground their corn; and especially because most of them 

 were found in the near neighborhood of the Indian ''hogans" or 

 camps. I had another object, however, than that of trying to find 

 pieces of igneous or eruptive rock, which was to find if possible some 

 pieces of meteoric stone, on the theory that perhaps the great meteor, 

 which by this time I had become firmly convinced produced this 

 crater, was partly metallic and partly stony in composition; in other 

 words, a siderolite. A most careful search of the country for miles 

 around failed to reveal the slightest evidence in favor of this theory. 

 None of the pieces of iron, and by this time several thousands of such 

 pieces have been found on all sides of the crater, have attached to 

 them any particle of stone; except indeed where some pieces of iron 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 883 



shale have been found adhering to small fragments of limestone and 

 sandstone, or in one small specimen which I found including them, 

 showing conclusively that this iron oxide was in a liquid or fused state 

 when it fell to the earth. In this specimen there are sealed together, 

 as sealing wax would hold them, three small angular fragments of 

 sandstone, and another piece of iron shale which I have is firmly adher- 

 ent to a piece of limestone, upon which it evidently fell when in a melted 

 condition. The latter specimen shows the green hydroxide of nickel. 

 The result of my careful search has been the conclusion that there is not 

 the slightest evidence in favor of the meteor having been part iron and 

 part stone. 



It is only fair to state, however, that upon one of my recent visits to 

 the crater, or accurately on June 24, 1905, 1 found on the surface of the 

 plain, about a mile and a half west of the mountain, a very remarkable 

 aerolite or meteoric stone. This is as different from all the other meteoric 

 specimens which we have examined, which have come from this locality, 

 as one specimen can be from another. It is subangular in shape, having 

 on one side a rather sharply pointed protuberance, with a generally 

 round and smooth smiace which is covered by quite a heavy film of 

 oxide of iron. Two corners were broken off when I found it. The 

 fracture exhibited was very fresh, in fact almost as fresh as the fracture 

 produced by me when knocking off a piece of it for analysis, which was 

 made by Mr. H. H. Alexander and is as follows: SiOj 37.32%; Fe 

 22.30%; Ni 1.65%; Mfi^ 2.53%; CaO 2.96%; MgO 23.02%; S 2.34%. 

 See also description and analysis of the stone which will be hereafter 

 published by Dr. ^lallet. 



It has some curious markings, looking as if it possibly had received a 

 blow before it entered the earth's atmosphere, these markings being 

 covered with the same film of oxide of iron which cover the rest of the 

 aerolite. A comparison of this analysis with the analysis of the Canon 

 Diablo meteoric iron shows the wide difference between the two, and 

 the fact that it does not contain a trace of platinum or iridium and 

 relatively small percentages of iron and nickel, while every specimen 

 which has been examined of the meteoric iron or iron shale found in 

 this locality contains the first mentioned metals, is very significant 

 and IS in favor of the theory that the aerolite or meteoric stone speci- 

 men is not in any way connected with the others. 



Now comes a story which is at least very interesting, for as a coin- 

 cidence, if such it is, it is very remarkable. Two years ago, about 

 January 15, 1904, while two of our employees at Coon Mountain were 

 watching the camp — we had suspended operatioas during the winter — 




884 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



they were awakened, so they told us, by a loud hissing noise, and look- 

 ing northward saw that the heavens were brilliantly lighted, and 

 while rushing out of their tent saw a meteor fall somewhere north- 

 west of the mountain, between them and the railroad. We paid no 

 especial attention to their story, and supposed that although they 

 might have seen a meteor fall, it had come to the earth, if it came to 

 the earth at all, many miles distant. However, if we have been able 

 to fix the dates correctly, on the same evening, at the same moment, a 

 few minutes before nine o'clock, the hour being fixed by the train 

 schedule. Dr. A. Rounsville, of Williams, and Dr. G. F. Manning, of 

 Flagstaff, Arizona, were travelling to Canon Diablo station, where 

 Dr. Manning had JDeen called to visit a patient. Just before the 

 train stopped Dr. Rounsville saw from one of the windows, on the 

 south side of the train, a blazing meteor fall in the direction of Coon 

 Mountain. According to Dr. Rounsville's statement Dr. ^Manning 

 did not see the meteor fall, but only saw the very brilliant light 

 produced by it. It is very probable that this was the same meteor 

 that was seen by our employees at Coon Mountain. If so it would 

 appear that our two employees saw it from one side, while Drs. 

 Rounsville and Manning saw it from the other, the observers being 

 al^out 12 miles apart. As accurately as I can determine, it was very near 

 a spot at the intersection of the two lines of sight, a spot which of course 

 they could not locate exactly, that I found the above described meteoric 

 stone — the only one, so Mr. Volz, of Canon Diablo, tells me, that has ever 

 been found in this locality, and his intimate knowledge of the locality 

 extends for a period of over fifteen years. That a small stony meteor- 

 ite should have fallen on almost exactly the same spot on the earth's 

 surface as the great Caiion Diablo iron meteorite fell many centuries 

 ago, is certainly a most remarkable coincidence. I have stated the 

 facts as accurately as possible, and I have no opinion to offer as to 

 whether or not these involve anything more than a coincidence. 



I have endeavored to describe in this paper as briefl}^ as possiljle 

 only such matters as would appeal to a geologist and which have come 

 within my personal observation. Such as they are, after a very careful 

 study of this locality, they do not leave in my mind a scintilla of doubt 

 that this mountain and its crater were produced by the impact of a 

 huge meteorite or small asteroid, and that this fell upon the earth 

 almost vertically, with probably a slight inclination toward the north. 

 As is explained above, the greatest effort seems to have been expended 

 on the southern side of the crater, as evidenced by the walls of the 

 crater itself and by the great amount of material thrown out on the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 885 



southern rim, and by the fact that this material is much more com- 

 minuted than similar material elsewhere on the rim, and by the further 

 fact that on this portion of the rim alone do we find fragments of the 

 yellow and red sandstone, which we know to be from the deepest 

 strata of which fragments have been expelled from the crater. This 

 theory is still further borne out by the fact that most of the shale balls 

 and smaller meteoric iron specimens have been found on the northern 

 rim, which position they would occupy if they fell slightly behind the 

 meteor itself, and yielded more than it did to the retarding effect of 

 the earth's atmosphere and to the force of gravity. 



In using the words "northern" and "southern" in the above con- 

 nection, I mean by "northern" any direction between northwest and 

 northeast; and by "southern" any direction between southeast and 

 southwest. However, the direction from which the meteor came is a 

 matter which is not as yet susceptible of positive proof and is of prob- 

 ably small importance at this time. 



To summarize, we believe we have proved the following facts : 



First. That a great meteor, the whole or at least the outside of 

 which was metallic in nature, did fall to the earth at this locality, and 

 that it was so large that portions of it became fused and were detached. 



Second. That this great hole in the upper strata of the Aubrey 

 formation was made at the instant of time when this meteor fell upon 

 this exact spot. Having proved these facts, the conclusion is unavoid- 

 able that this hole, which as we have seen cannot have been produced 

 by a .volcano or by a steam explosion, was produced by the impact of 

 the meteor, which, even admitting that it retained some large pro- 

 portion of its planetary speed, must have been of great size. 



Having proved these facts, and having been prevented by wet 

 silica, a material very difficult to penetrate with a shaft, from sink- 

 ing with a horse-whim to a depth of more than 200 feet, we put 

 down a number of drill holes in the hope of finding evidence of the 

 meteor beneath the central plain in the crater, using the ordinary 

 type of rotary well-boring machinery. Several of these drill holes 

 encountered obstructions, at least one (and probably more) of which 

 would seem to be meteoric, inasmuch as a magnet put down at the time 

 was strongly attracted to the obstructing object and brought up from 

 it material which assayed four-tenths of one per cent, of nickel. We 

 were unable to force the drill past this obstruction. In another hole 

 the extreme depth of 1.020 feet was reached. In this, however, over 

 100 feet of red sandstone (the Red Beds above referred to) was pene- 

 trated. This seemed to be in place and to form the floor of what, 




886 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



judging by the results of artillery experiments, we have termed the 

 inner or interior crater, somewhere in which we suppose the wreck of 

 the meteoric body to lie. In all of the holes the material (silica, 

 broken and whole sand grains and some pieces of dense layers of ce- 

 mented material composed largely of carbonate of lime) brought up by 

 the drill from underneath the lacustrine sedimentary formations shows 

 when concentrated many minute fragments of iron shale or minute shale 

 balls which contain an appreciable percentage of nickel, and are therefore 

 doubtless meteoric in nature. It seems certain that much of the nickel 

 has been leached from these fine particles of meteoric material, but not- 

 withstanding this fact they invariably have been found to contain a small 

 fraction of one per cent, of this element, and in other respects are gen- 

 erally similar to the fine particles of iron shale which we have found on 

 the outside of the crater. This evidence, to say the least, is strongly 

 corroborative of, if not absolute proof of, the above theory. To test it 

 still further, however, we are now proceeding to sink with a steam 

 hoist a double compartment shaft in the exact center of the crater. 

 Unless we should be prevented by difficulties which we cannot over- 

 come, this will be sunk to such depths as will demonstrate the existence, 

 as we suppose in a fragmentary condition and several hundred feet 

 below the central plain, or the non-existence of the extra-terrestrial 

 body which, in my best judgment, produced when it collided with the 

 earth the crater which I have endeavored to describe.^"

COON BUTTE, ARIZONA. 

 BY BENJAMIN CHEW TILGHMAN. 



In Central Arizona, situated at approximately longitude 111° 1' west 

 and latitude 36° 2' north, about five miles almost due south of Sun- 

 shine Station on the line of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa ¥6 Railroad, 

 is situated the very remarkable eminence known locally by the names 

 of Coon Butte, Coon Mountain and Crater Mountain. 



This so-called mountain consists of a circular ridge from 130 to 160 

 feet in height, surrounding an almost circular cup-shaped depression 

 in the earth about 400 feet deep and varying from 3,600 to 3,800 feet 

 in diameter. Viewed from the inside, the crest of the ridge is elevated 

 from 530 to 560 feet above the level of the flat interior plain. 



The strata penetrated by this hole are, first, from twenty to forty feet 

 of red sandstone; second, about 250 to 350 feet of a yellowish silicious 

 limestone, or possibly more correctly a very calcareous sandstone; 

 third, an unknown depth of a whitish or light gray sandstone, consisting 

 of rather small water-worn grains but weakly attached to each other; 

 fourth, about 80 to 100 feet of brownish sandstone in which it ter- 

 minates. The contact between these latter strata is some 880 feet 

 below the floor of the crater, but there is some reason to think it may 

 not be in place but below its original position. These strata are of 

 late Carboniferous formation, and in the surrounding plain lie perfectly 

 level and conformably with each other. The uppermost, the red sand- 

 stone, being almost removed by erosion and only showing in spots upon 

 the plain in the form of more or less scattered flat-topped red buttes, 

 although it seems to have been nearly or quite continuous over the 

 area now occupied by the interior edge of the crater. 



These same level strata cover the plain in all directions for many 

 miles. They are cut through by Cafion Diablo to a depth of some 

 sixty to seventy feet about two miles to the westward of the crater, 

 and near this gorge are two large earth cracks penetrating the strata to 

 an unknown depth. 



Immediately around the crater the strata dip outward in all directions 

 from the center of the crater at an angle of about thirty degrees, and 

 are raised from 140 to 180 feet above the normal position. This is the 

 locality in which the Cafion Diablo meteoric iron has been found to the 




888 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



amount of some ten to fifteen tons, and the question as to wliether or 

 not the hypothetical main body of the meteorite formed the crater in 

 question in its impact with the eartli has been the subject of numerous 

 speculations and papers, notably by Professor Gilbert, of the United 

 States Geological Survey, and others. The shape and general appear- 

 ance of the crater, together with the absolute and entire absence of all 

 evidence of volcanic action in or around it, manifestly inclined these 

 early observers to decide this question, at least tentatively, in the 

 affirmative, and they regarded the matter as worthy of further investi- 

 gation. In pursuance of this object Professor Gilbert devised what 

 he at the time, regarded as two crucial experiments to determine the 

 presence or absence of a large amount of meteoric iron in the bottom of 

 the crater. These were, first, a topographical survey of the hole and 

 rim by which he made their contents approximately ec^ual, and there- 

 fore gave no room for the presence of the bulk of the very considerable 

 body required to produce such a hole by its impact; and secondly, a 

 magnetic survey of the locality, which by its negative results was thought 

 to preclude the possibility of the presence of any considerable mass of 

 metallic iron in the vicinity. By these two experiments the question 

 seemed to be authoritatively decided in the negative and the whole 

 matter has remained in abeyance for many years. 



The author of this present paper, having had his attention called to 

 the matter by his friend Mr. D. M. Barringer, has examined the locality 

 with great care, and with ]Mr. Barringer has done a considerable amount 

 of development work there, and as a result of the facts disclosed there- 

 by is very strongly of the opinion that the hole and its rim were pro- 

 duced in exactly the way at first supposed by the earlier investigators, 

 and wishes here to bring to notice several points in support of the cor- 

 rectness of this theory which have escaped notice, or at least mention, 

 in the papers of the earlier investigators of this most interesting 

 locality. 



It is first, however, necessary to criticise the so-called crucial experi- 

 ments of Professor Gilbert, upon the results of which he definitely aban- 

 doned the theory of the meteoric formation of the crater in cjuestion, 

 as, if these can be regarded as definite^ settling the matter in the nega- 

 tive, there is no use in bringing forward facts looking towards its prob- 

 ability, no matter how plausible they may be. In regard to the first 

 of these crucial experiments, that is, the alleged identical contents of 

 the rim and the hole. In reply to this it can only be said that the 

 author has also made surveys of this locality, and is very sure that the 

 contents of the rim not only does not show the excess over that of the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 889 



hole that would allow for a large buried meteorite in the latter, l)ut 

 that it is short by many, at least several million, cubic yards of the 

 quantity necessary to fill the hole at all. This, of course, if correct, 

 and of that the author has no doubt, entirely destroys the weight 

 of Professor Gilbert's reasoning, which was based on the assumed 

 fact that everything ejected from the hole still remained around it. 

 The solution is, of course, that in the time since the impact the rim 

 has been reduced to its present dimensions by erosion, and the reason 

 why it is or was so particularly subject to erosion will be taken up later 

 when the formations of the rim are discussed more in detail. 



As to the absence of sufficient magnetic perturbation, this is on its 

 face a much more serious objection, as it undouJDtedly proves the 

 absence of any one large mass of iron near the locality, whether mag- 

 netized itself or only magnetized by the induction of the earth's mag- 

 netism, and also the absence of a mass of fragments of a magnetically 

 neutral but magnetically permeable character magnetized by the induc- 

 tive action of the earth. But it would have no bearing whatever as 

 to the presence or absence of a mass of magnetized fragments each 

 having sufficient coercive force of its own to be independent of the 

 earth's inductive action, to the extent at least of retaining its own 

 proper polarity irrespective of the position in which it is placed in 

 regard to the terrestrial magnetic field. Such a mass of polarized 

 fragments would form a series of closed magnetic circuits with prac- 

 tically no external field whatever. In support of this the following 

 experiment was made. Two little cubes of magnetite about half an 

 inch on one side were taken, which, as nearly as could be observed, 

 had about the same effect on the magnetic needle. The weaker of the 

 two, if there was any difference, was preserved intact, and the stronger 

 was carefully broken up without loss to about the size of coarse sand. 

 These fragments were then packed in a paper case but little larger than 

 the original piece had been. It was found that this had to be approach- 

 ed to within an eighth of an inch of the compass needle to produce the 

 same deflection that the original piece did at eight inches. Not only 

 this, but it was found that one single grain of the sand-like fragments 

 of the pulverized magnetite had more effect upon the compass needle 

 when taken alone than the whole mass of them had when taken to- 

 gether. If the attraction of the mass of fragments of the supposed 

 iron meteorite could be reduced in this proportion to its normal attrac- 

 tion when in a single piece, it might, on Professor Gilbert's own figures, 

 lie within a very short distance of the surface of the present bottom of 

 the hole. 




890 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



The only remaining questions in regard to this so-called crucial 

 experiment are : First, could the meteorite be reduced to this condition 

 of physical wreck? and second, do the fragments have the necessary 

 inherent magnetism? As to the last requirement, the overwhelming 

 majority of the fragments picked up on the surface, probably ninety- 

 eight per cent., do have this much magnetism, and some much more, 

 and there is no reason to believe that the fragments of the main mass, 

 if there be such, differ much, if any, in this regard from pieces collected 

 on the surface. 



Now, as to the probability of the shock of the collision breaking up 

 the body of a solid iron meteorite of considerable size to sufficiently 

 small fragments, it can only be submitted that the velocity and shock 

 were enormous, and that it has been shown that ordinary soft iron at 

 the temperature of liquid air is of about the brittleness of glass under 

 the shock of a blow. Now, as it is practically certain that the body of 

 such a falling mass would be at the actual absolute zero of space be- 

 neath its incandescent exterior, it seems much more than probable that 

 the result of such a collision would be to reduce the projectile to an 

 extremely fine state of subdivision in comparison with its original size. 

 If these conditions of subdivision and magnetism are present, and it 

 seems much more than probable that they are, the crux of the second 

 crucial experiment is also escaped and we may proceed to consider the 

 question on its merits, as nothing forbids us from allowing the possi- 

 bility that the wreck of a great iron meteorite may underlie the bottom 

 of the crater of Coon Butte. 



Distribution of Irons around the Hole. 



The early accounts of the locations of the finds of irons about this 

 locality the author regards as of very doubtful value, for the reason 

 that the great majority of these finds have been made by persons who 

 were engaged in the occupation of selling them to museums and col- 

 lectors, and who naturally did not wish to disclose the source of their 

 supply to others. Also, these previous finds have been principally of 

 large size, big enough in fact to enable them to take quite a divergent 

 trajectory from that of the main mass, and too few to enable any 

 reliable generalization to be drawn from their locations, even if the 

 latter could be regarded as thoroughly reliable. 



In the last two years the author and men in his and Mr. Barringer's 

 employ have picked up more than 2,000 such irons, ranging in weight 

 from 200 pounds down to a small fraction of an ounce, and have plotted 

 the position of these finds upon a chart which shows plainly that the 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 891 



principal locality for such finds is in the shape of a crescent surround- 

 ing the hole and strictly concentric therewith, and embracing its edges 

 from the northwest to the east and having its line of greatest density 

 about midway between these two points. These directions are taken 

 from the center of the hole. The above distribution is by the number 

 of finds regardless of their weight, as that of the scattering outlying 

 finds is as a rule so much greater than that of the nearer finds as to 

 entirely disturb the symmetry of the distribution. Moreover, the dis- 

 position of the smaller irons, which from their irregular forms and light 

 weight could not have been propelled far from the mass from which 

 they separated, is of more importance than that of the larger fragments, 

 which would have more liberty of independent motion. 



Distribution of Magnetic Oxide of Iron around the Hole. 



In addition to the irons found around the hole there is a very con- 

 siderable amount of magnetic oxide of iron similarly distributed, the 

 disposition of which does not differ materially from that of the irons 

 themselves. For although it is more generally distributed around the 

 hole and the radius of the area upon which it is found is considerably 

 greater, yet the fragments are arranged in the same general way with 

 the axis of the group, which is also the line of greatest density of their 

 deposition, extending away from the center of the hole in a direction 

 between north and northeast. 



Proof of the Meteoric Origin of the Magnetic Oxide of Iron. 



The fact that this magnetite is of meteoric origin is proved from the 

 following facts : First — It is found attached to and in some of the 

 cavities of some of the larger irons. Second — Some of the larger pieces, 

 although not the largest, are found to have centers of metallic meteoric 

 iron. Third — The chemical analysis of the iron and the magnetite 

 show a very close agreement between the proportion of metallic iron 

 and the other metals present in the magnetite and in the meteoric iron. 

 These other metals consist of nickel, cobalt, platinum and iridium, and 

 another metal or metals of the platinum group. Fourth — The mag- 

 netite is fused and massive and at the same time stratified and lami- 

 nated, and in general appearance different from any terrestrial mag- 

 netite known and closely resembles what would be thought, a 'priori, to 

 be the appearance of such a product of iron melted and burned on the 

 surface of a great meteorite in its passage through the air.

Identity in Position of the Point of Impact of the Meteorite 

 WITH the Center of the Hole, and Identity in Time of the 

 Formation of the Hole with the Impact of the Meteorite. 



We thus have two different meteoric materials distributed over the 

 rim of the hole and the surrounding plain on areas symmetrical about 

 the same line, which is a line drawn in a north-northeasterly direction 

 from the center of the hole. And also each of these areas closely 

 embraces the hole and there terminates. For, with few exceptions, no 

 iron nor magnetite has been found on the surface within the hole, and 

 these exceptional pieces were found close to the wall, and may have 

 fallen in by ordinary weathering action from the cliffs along with out- 

 side surface material. This brings these meteoric materials into close 

 relation with the hole, which cannot be accidental, as if the shower of 

 meteoric iron and magnetite fell after the formation of the hole, by 

 other agencies, it is inconceivable that the densest portion of the 

 shower of each material should coincide accurately with the north- 

 easterly rim of the hole and yet none fall into it, although scattered 

 individuals of each shower are found around the hole on all sides. 

 Wliereas, if the shower occurred before the formation of the hole, it is 

 equally inconceivable that the fallen material could be found most 

 thickly on the surface of the rim, composed of material ejected from the 

 hole. To further assiu'e the absolute identity in point of time of the 

 fall of meteoric material and the formation of the hole, cuts and shafts 

 were made in the debris composing the rim, and up to date over one 

 hundred pieces of meteoric material have been taken from the ground, 

 at distances varying from six inches to twenty-seven feet below the 

 surface, mixed with the rim material and under large imbedded rocks. 

 In many places it was absoluteh' impossible, from the slope of the 

 ground and other circumstances, that the}^ could have gotten where 

 found except by simultaneous deposition with the broken material 

 forming the rim. In one shaft seven pieces were found with fifteen 

 feet of vertical depth between the highest and the lowest, which was 

 twenty-seven feet below the surface of the ejected material. 



The Rim. 



This consists, as has been briefly stated before, of a circular ridge of 

 from 130 to 160 feet high closely surrounding the hole. A generalized 

 description of its profile would be somewhat as follows : Beginning at 

 a point on the inside of the hole on a level with the surrounding plain, 

 the surface of the rim consists of the edges of the strata which should 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 893 



normally be lying level some 150 feet below the surface. These strata 

 themselves clip downward and outward from the center of the hole at 

 an angle of, on the average, about thirty degrees, although this varies 

 in places from more than vertical or inclining backward to about ten 

 degrees. The strata themselves are crushed and shattered to an extra- 

 ordinary degree, and the surface of the rim slopes upward and outward 

 from the center of the hole at an angle of from fifty to eighty degrees ; 

 possibly sixty degrees would describe the general shape better than any 

 other slope. Considering the shattered and disintegrated material of 

 which these cliffs are composed, it is remarkable how little talus has 

 fallen from them. This slope continues up almost to the top of the 

 ridge, although here and there are flat benches in it both at the junction 

 of the yellow limestone and the red sandstone and at partings in the 

 red sandstone itself. From fifteen to forty feet from the top of the 

 ridge on the inside is located the top of the red sandstone, which was 

 the original surface of the plain ; at the place of impact and from this 

 point the ridge slopes outward at the ordinary sliding angle of loose 

 materials, somewhat less than forty degrees, to its summit. The sum- 

 mit of the ridge is of necessity a closed ring and is sharply serrated into 

 peaks, and the colls between these serrations do not exceed thirty to 

 forty feet in depth but their slopes are steep, often ten to twenty de- 

 grees. There is a marked low place in the rim, extending over nearly 

 one-sixth of its circumference on its northern side. On the outside 

 no description will suffice for all sides. The greatest amount, by far, 

 of the material thrown out of the hole is found in the southern quarter 

 of its circumference, and here the rim is almost flat on top for a number 

 of yards and then slopes outward at an angle of only seven degrees for 

 some 900 feet, where it ends in a sharp slope of some twenty-five feet 

 high at an angle of some twenty degrees. Beyond this is a thin cover 

 of ejected material and detached and partly buried limestone frag- 

 ments which extend for a considerable distance; some of the latter 

 having been thrown nearly a mile from the edge of the hole. The 

 actual surface of this southern side of the rim consists largely of blown 

 sand, as the winds in the country are strong and storms frequent and 

 their usual direction is from the southwest. On the eastern, northern 

 and western sides the ridge is thin and sharp ; in many places not over a 

 yard or so in thickness at the very top and sloping outward very 

 sharply, in places up to thirty degrees, for about half its height, and 

 then more gradually at some five degrees until it joins the plain. The 

 general surface of the outer slope is not at all a smooth cone of the 

 angles above stated, but is cut up into hills and hollows and every 




894 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



imaginable subfeature to a very great degree. This is almost entirely 

 due to the irregularity of its deposition, slightly modified later by the 

 action of water. The surface material of the outside of the rim, where 

 it is not covered with blown sand, as on the southern side, is composed 

 of the broken debris of the three strata through which the hole pene- 

 trates, piled together in the utmost confusion and disorder, pieces from 

 all the three strata being thrown together in the most intimate mixture 

 with a slight tendency towards inversion in the order of their deposi- 

 tion. That is, there is rather more of the red sandstone in the deeper 

 portions of the rim than on the surface, while on the surface the lime- 

 stone and white sandstone predominate, with here and there large 

 areas of unmixed white sandstone lying on the surface. In size these 

 fragments vary from huge rocks forty to fifty feet in length and weigh- 

 ing thousands of tons down to impalpable powder and all intermediate 

 sizes, and many of the rocks are so crushed and broken that they barely 

 hold together. And imbedded in the deposits of impalpable powder 

 are many pieces still retaining the form of rocks, still showing the 

 stratification and bedding planes distinctly, but so crushed as to have 

 lost all solidity. These crushed rocks in many cases have been subjected 

 to such pressure that not only is their consistency as rocks destroyed, 

 but even a certain proportion of the sand grains composing them have 

 been utterly destroyed and they can be rubbed between the fingers to 

 a fine powder, the grains of which will average much less than that of 

 the sand grains originally composing the stone. 



This powder forms a very considerable proportion of the substance 

 of the rim. It is not merely a filling material occupying the interstices 

 between the rocks, as might be a rock pile with fine material water- 

 washed or wind-blown into it until all the crevices were filled up solid. 

 But it occurs in distinct deposits, sometimes alone and entirely free 

 from rock fragments and sometimes mixed with a larger or smaller 

 proportion of rock fragments. When this mixture occurs, the rock 

 fragments are usually so far apart that each rock is entirely surrounded 

 and supported by the powder. Such deposits of powdered rock are 

 often overlaid by a cover of broken rock many feet thick, the individual 

 rocks in places weighing a hundred tons or more. In fact, as far as at 

 present developed, it seems to be a very general feature of the structure 

 of the rim that the lowest material, that lying upon the top of the orig- 

 inal surface, is a greater or less depth of this powdered rock, some- 

 times alone and sometimes mixed with rock fragments, and that on this 

 rests and is supported the whole of the detrital cover which constitutes 

 the crest and outer slopes of the rim.

The Interior of the Hole. 



From the point on the level with the exterior plain on the inside of 

 the rim the walls of the hole slope downward and inwa d at a constantly 

 diminishing angle for a distance varying from 50 to 150 feet, in the same 

 formation as above described as the base of the inside of the rim. At 

 this point the rock walls begin to be covered with a rocky talus corre- 

 sponding in all respects with the rocky cover on the exterior of the ridge. 

 For about half the circumference of the hole the yellow limestone 

 extends downward to the talus, and for the remaining half it exposes 

 more or less of the whitish sandstone below. The white sandstone is 

 a much weaker rock than the yellow limestone, and at their contact it 

 is noticed that the former is much crushed and disintegrated by the 

 pressure exerted b}^ it in lifting the limestone. This stratum of crushed 

 sandstone varies in thickness up to some ten or fifteen feet as a maxi- 

 mum, and in some places, usually immediately below the limestone, it 

 is reduced to a bed of sand grains absolutely unconnected with each 

 other, and in places a small proportion of even the sand grains have 

 been crushed and broken to fragments and powder. 



The very top of the talus slope is in places at an angle of forty degrees, 

 but usually much flatter down to thirty and twenty-five degrees, this 

 rapidly becoming less and less as it recedes from the cliffs until it is 

 lying at an angle of not more than six degrees at the point where it 

 disappears under the central plain. This central plain is an almost 

 circular area of about 1,800 feet in mean diameter, with a surface gener- 

 ally flat but gently rolling within a limit of fifteen feet, with its lowest 

 point a few feet to the east of the central meridian of the hole and about 

 sixty feet south of the center. Shafts have shown the rocky talus to 

 extend under this central plain at about the same angle that it has 

 above for a distance of at least 400 feet, at which point it is some 

 forty-seven feet below the surface and about twenty feet thick. This 

 talus does not extend entirely across the hole. It is absent at points 

 50 feet southwest and 200 feet southeast of the center of the hole. 

 Exactly where it terminates is not known. 



The Silica. 



It is here necessary to describe more minutely the material of the 

 filling of the central plain. This is identical with the impalpably 

 powdered rock referred to briefly above in the description of the rim. 

 This material, of which there are millions of tons in the rim and the 

 bottom of the hole, consists of the rock of the strata concerned reduced 




896 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC.,, 



to an extreme state of subdivision. It seems to have been produced 

 principally from the white sandstone, for it is mostly as white as snow 

 and consists of over ninety-nine per cent, silica, although here and 

 there small areas or deposits will be of a slightly yellowish color from 

 the yellow limestone and contain a little carbonate of lime, although 

 this has to a great extent been leached out of it, and much more rarely 

 of a reddish color, either stained by or produced from the top stratum 

 of red sandstone. Under the microscope it is seen to consist of minute 

 fragments of clear transparent quartz with edges and points of extreme 

 sharpness, and no signs of any wearing or rounding are anywhere 

 visible upon its particles. In some areas the material is composed of 

 this material exclusively and it gives no internal evidence of the man- 

 ner of its production. But in other localities it can be found contain- 

 ing a greater or less percentage of broken sand grains among it which 

 have escaped being crushed out of all recognizable shape. A continu- 

 ous series of material can be found containing more and more broken 

 sand grains and less and less silica (as we have gotten to call the impal- 

 pable powder, for want of a better short descriptive name), and then 

 more and more unbroken sand grains, and then little bunches of sand 

 grains still adhering together, and so on up to the solid sandstone rock. 

 Its general microscopic appearance is identical with that of a handful 

 of glass fragments produced by a blow. It cannot be c^uite imitated 

 by grinding the sand grains in a mortar, as the edges and points of the 

 powder thus produced are more blunted and roimder and broken than 

 those of the silica. But it is very closely duplicated by the finest 

 powder produced by firing a high power rifle bullet against a block of 

 the sandstone. 



The Interior of the Hole (resumed). 



In the central area over which the talus does not extend, the line of 

 the original surface upon which the talus was deposited, and on which 

 the subsequent filling, which now covers this and also a portion of the 

 talus, was deposited, can be very readily recognized. All the material 

 lying above the talus, and above this surface, is horizontally stratified 

 and contains organic remains, such as small shells and no (or but very 

 few and small) rock fragments, while that below this line has no trace 

 of stratification nor of organic remains and contains many rock frag- 

 ments. In one shaft a beautiful series of rock fragments was observed 

 about twenty feet thick and about twenty feet below the talus, in which 

 the natural order of the rock in place was exactly reversed ; that is, the 

 red sandstone was deepest and the yellow limestone and whitish sand- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 897 



stone in that order above it. This series naturally suggested the idea 

 that the surface stratum, having received the blow and started on its 

 aerial flight first when the hole was formed, finished its journey first and 

 was consequently deepest imbedded in the silica which was in process 

 of filling the hole made during the flight of these rocks in the air. 

 Almost immediately after the fall of the last of this series — which must 

 have fallen directly in place as found and which is comparatively rare, 

 as the rocks expelled from the hole had usually (apparently) a greater 

 outward radial component in the direction of their flight — came the 

 rush of talus rocks, which fell in masses on the funnel-shaped cliffs 

 surrounding the hole and forming the interior of the rim, and rushing 

 inward covered the surface of the bottom of the hole to a consider- 

 able distance from the foot of the cliffs, in fact probably all except 

 a small area of 300 or 400 feet in diameter in the center. Then, 

 during minutes and hours, settled down over everything about the 

 locality the dense cloud of dust to the depth of many feet. This dust, 

 being the finer portions of the silica above described, was then washed 

 into the center of the hole, filling it in some places a hundred feet deep. 

 This was apparently done by successive wet seasons for many years, 

 during which time, at least in the rainy season, a shallow lake occupied 

 the bottom of the hole; over the bottom of which the sediments were 

 distributed in yearly level strata by wave action. The presence of 

 the rare stone fragments in these sediments and the few now on the 

 surface of the interior plain, far beyond any possible place to which 

 they could have rolled if detached and falling from the cliffs, is difficult 

 of explanation unless it be due to a frozen condition of the central lake, 

 on the surface of which these rocks (and they have not been observed 

 of large size) could slide and on which a very slight initial velocity 

 would take them to their present position, to be there deposited upon 

 the melting of the ice. Ten to fourteen inches of ice was formed on the 

 open water in reservoirs in this locality during the last winter. 



No very exact estimate of the amount of this silica dust washed 

 down from the sides of the hole can be made, as the shape of the original 

 bottom of the hole is unknown. It is irregular and in places the sedi- 

 ments are 100 feet thick, and it covers an area of about 1,800 feet in 

 diameter. Moreover, it evidently fills the interstices of the talus of 

 unknown thickness extending over a much greater area. It can only 

 be said that it is a very large amount, many million tons. It probably 

 covered all of the exterior of the rim to an equal or greater depth, all 

 of which is gone. In fact it seems extremely probable that the rock 

 cover of the rim, which is now its most prominent feature, on the sur- 

 58 




898 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



face of which both rocks and meteoric material are much more frequent 

 than in the substance of the rim below, is itself a concentration of 

 material like the present rim, below the rock cover, of mixed silica 

 powder and rock, from which the silica powder has been washed away 

 until the accumulated rock cover, and probably the decreasing rainfall 

 of the country, has preserved the rim now remaining beneath this rock 

 cover in its present form. Also, upon the accident as to whether or 

 not there was a strong wind blowing at the time of the formation of the 

 hole would determine w^hether or not a great portion of the fine powder 

 produced ever settled on or around the rim at all. Hence, in the opin- 

 ion of the author, the deficiency in the contents of the present rim to 

 fill the existing hole, and this fact is also a valid objection to the use 

 of their comparative bulks as having any bearing whatever upon the

 tom of the hole. 



The Traces of the Luminous Tail of the Great Meteor. 



It occurred to the author that if the meteoric theory of the formation 

 of this crater was correct, such a projectile falling through the atmo- 

 sphere at the requisite speed must have been surrounded by the usual 

 luminous tail always accompanying such objects. And that as no me- 

 teoric material except nickel-iron and magnetite containing nickel had 

 been found in the vicinity, it was a fair deduction that the surface of 

 such meteorite, if it ever existed, was of nickel-iron, and that the lu- 

 minous tail in such case must have consisted of atomized particles of 

 incandescent magnetite. Pursuant to this idea a search for this mate- 

 rial was made with magnets about the locality, and it was found that 

 its presence w^as absolutely universal over the whole locality inside the 

 hole and out for as far as observed, somewhat over two miles from the 

 hole. It consists of a blackish-gray rather fine-grained powder, strongly 

 attractable by the magnet, crystalline in structure, but not at all so 

 in shape, being in small torn irregular masses with generally intensely 

 fine grains of silica powder adhering so firmly to its surface as to sug- 

 gest adhesion wdiile in a state of fusion. Of very rare occurrence 

 among it are absolutely round balls with a fused polished surface like 

 intensely fine shot. These, it is supposed, have had time to solidify 

 in the vacuum behind the flying meteor free from the fierce rush of air 

 that had solidified the usual grain in any shape whatever, and they 

 were enabled thus to assume the usual shape of liquid drops. 



With considerable labor enough of these particles were collected 

 for analysis, and they were found to contain nickel in but little less

proportion to their iron than fovuid in the irons themselves and in the 

 larger pieces of magnetite. This is not a usual substance and, so far 

 as known, is not a constituent of any of the rocks in the neighborhood 

 of the area anywhere adjacent to the same. 



Ox THE Fine Silica Powder under the Base of the Rim. 



The meteoric theory of the formation of this hole being thought 

 untenable by some previous investigators and the ordinary volcanic 

 action being absent, there has been invoked, to account for its formation, 

 the theory of a single steam explosion, and in fact this theory has been 

 elaborated so far as to try to imagine a state of stress produced by steam 

 which was set off by the blow of a small falling meteorite, much in the 

 same manner that a percussion cap discharges a gun. This was evolved 

 to account for the simultaneous deposition of the meteoric material 

 and the rim. This has been urged in spite of the fact that during the 

 time that the local heat had been increasing in the wet strata there 

 would have inevitably been hot spring action, and that the same thing 

 would have occurred long after the relief of the explosion, and that the 

 traces of this action would have been but little, if any, less evident than 

 those of ordinary volcanic action and are nevertheless totally absent. 

 Yet there is one fact obvious to all observers to-day, to which the 

 author desires to call attention, which makes any such theory of the 

 explosive formation of the hole utterly impossible. This is the fact 

 that the rim is generally founded upon a more or less deep layer of 

 fine silica powder. There is no doubt that the rock fragments forming 

 the rim were all deposited within a few seconds after the hole was made. 

 The great majority were propelled too short a horizontal distance to 

 have had a long trajectory in the air. Now if they had been propelled 

 by a compressed elastic medium, it is evident that on the explosion 

 these compressed gases would have instantly assumed a much higher 

 velocity than the heavy rock particles to which they were imparting 

 velocity and, sweeping by them, would have carried with them every 

 particle of silica powder which had been made by the crushing an^ 

 yielding of the strata to the strain, and the rocks of the rim would cer- 

 tainly and necessarily have fallen on the bare upturned stratum which 

 had previously formed the surface of the ground around the edge of 

 the hole. To account for the presence of this silica powder on the 

 theory that the hole was formed by a great projectile requires a short 

 preliminary study as to the yielding of hard, brittle and practically 

 incompressible material before a projectile or other blow or even quiet 

 pressure, for the method is much the same in both cases. Briefly, the 




900 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



way in which such substances yield to either a pressure or blow in 

 excess of their power of resistance is, that a cone of material with an 

 apex angle of about ninety degrees is compressed downward into the 

 solid mass of the material from the point of impact. This cone parts 

 from the overlying material, crushes into powder under the force of 

 the pressure or blow, and this powder being still further compressed 

 transmits the pressure upon it in all directions, somewhat like a 

 fluid, although not equally in all directions. The pressure thus gen- 

 erated in the very substance of the material seeks relief and forces a 

 yielding of the solid material around it, which, of course, occurs along 

 the line of least resistance, and bursts the surface upward and outward 

 into a cone-shaped crater around the point of impact or pressure, the 

 angle of which depends largely upon the nature of the material. With 

 ordinary stone this is usually about thirty degrees, but always must be 

 less than forty-five degrees, which is its limit. This crater-like cone 

 is small at first and remains so for weak impacts or small pressiu-es, 

 but if these are greater the process is continued by the formation of 

 larger cones of compressed powder, deeper in the bod}' of the material, 

 which relieve themselves by bursting up wider craters, until the force 

 of the pressure or impact is no longer able to continue the process and 

 the penetration ceases. Thus the depth of the crater always bears a 

 definite relation to its width, and in large impacts it is found that the 

 crater is always surrounded by a cone of cracked and shattered material, 

 which would have been the next material to be expelled if the energy 

 of the blow had been sufficiently great to accomplish this. 



The bearing of this upon the formation of a rim composed in part of 

 fine powder is as follows. The broken rocks and debris that are ex- 

 pelled from the hole get their velocity imparted to them by the push 

 of an inelastic powder behind them and not by a compressed elastic 

 gas, and thus when both rock fragments and powder have progressed 

 far enough to free themselves from the pressure of the penetrating 

 projectile they fly on together, mixed powder and rocks, at the same 

 velocity. This powder is not dust in the ordinary acceptation of the 

 word, as fine powder mixed with a large quantity of air which takes a 

 long time to settle out, but is almost unmixed with air in solid masses, 

 particle to particle, like flour in a barrel, so to speak, which masses 

 obey the laws of projectiles and falling bodies, irrespective of the ex- 

 ceedingly minute particles of which they are formed, and are thus de- 

 posited in the rim in mixture with and under and over the solid rock 

 masses which accompanied it in its flight, and as quickly ; and the powder 

 having started under the rock masses, there is a strong tendency for con- 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 901 



siderable amounts to remain imder them on the final deposition of the 

 mixed masses of material in the rim of the hole after their expulsion. ■ 



The Crushed Sandstone at Its Upper Contact with the Lime- 

 stone AND THE Shattered Cliffs around the Hole. 



The author desires particularly to call attention to these features of 

 the walls surrounding the hole. It is very distinctly marked. It is 

 unqestionably due to excessive pressure. If this cone and crater are 

 due to any form of volcanic action, it is difficult to see how this crush- 

 ing occurred. The sandstone is amply strong to carry its over-biu"den 

 without crushing ; in fact before the general erosion of this country it 

 probably carried many hundreds or thousands feet more without crush- 

 ing and pressure from above or below as equal in its crushing effects. 

 Then suppose pressure to gradually accumulate and the overlying 

 strata to bulge up into the dome of which the present cone is the base; 

 there could be accumulated but little excess of pressure to crush the 

 sandstone during this rise, as it would be as free to go up under the 

 weight of its overlying strata as it was to support them quiescent, for 

 such motion would be very slow. Then comes the giving way and the 

 explosion, and the result to the remaining rock left around the hole is a 

 relief from pressure and not an increase of it. It is difficult under any 

 of these conditions to imagine any force tending to crush this sandstone 

 and shatter the surrounding walls in the manner that they are shown 

 to-day. It is difficult to discuss the steam explosion theory, for the 

 reason that nobody has ever seen one or known with certainty of any 

 such action, except the blowing off of the tops or sides of ordinary 

 volcanoes in activity in this manner, which is as different as possible 

 in its effects from the so-called maars. There are a lot of holes, not 

 very uniform nor congruous among themselves, which, for want of a 

 better explanation of their formation, have been ascribed to this source, 

 and to which class Coon Butte has been assigned by Prof. Gilbert, as 

 the result of his investigations. This crushing of strata and shattering 

 the walls is, however, the direct and obvious result of the blow of a great 

 projectile. There is almost instantaneously generated an overwhelming 

 pressure deep down in the rocks, tending to lift the surrounding strata 

 at 1,000 or more feet per second. The great weight and inertia of these 

 strata oppose an enormous obstacle to this sudden movement, and the 

 crushing strains developed crush up the weakest rock until the necessary 

 yielding and velocity have been imparted to the overlying strata. The 

 shattered cliffs and upraised rim show the rock started from its position 

 and in partial transition from the hole, from which it would have been 




902 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



expelled entirely had the blow been a little harder. In this case, how- 

 ever, another rim of crushed and shattered rocks would have been 

 upraised around the enlarged hole. 



Comparison of the Crater with those Produced by Lesser 



Projectiles. 



The craters formed by the impact of various small projectiles, mostly 

 of soft materials and at low velocities, have been studied in connec- 

 tion with the formation shown in this locality by others, notably by 

 Professor Gilbert, and the forms shown to bear a rather close resem- 

 blance to the crater of Coon Butte and its rim. Continuing these com- 

 parisons, however, to more violent impacts of heavier bodies at higher 

 velocities, a still closer parallel is noticed. The material for such 

 comparisons is furnished by the investigations of the several more ad- 

 vanced military nations upon the effects of the impact of round shot on 

 masonry and solid rock. These investigations were undertaken about 

 sixty to seventy years ago, with the object of ascertaining the best 

 effects of the ordnance of that day in the breaching of walls, etc., in 

 bombardments. The general result was to establish the fact that the 

 impact of the projectile produced a comparatively shallow crater of 

 conical form about five times the diameter of the projectile, termi- 

 nating in an almost cylindrical hole some one and a half to twice the 

 diameter of the projectile within which the projectile or its wreck 

 was deposited. This hole was surrounded by a cone of broken and 

 shattered material which started at or below the bottom of the cylin- 

 drical hole and enveloped the actual cavity. The depth in solid lime- 

 stone and sandstone, at velocities at which the best cast iron shot would 

 break up, and estimated, from the powder charges used, to be somewhere 

 about 1,800 feet per second, was a fraction under two diameters of the 

 projectile used. The depth was observed to increase much more 

 slowly than the velocity of the shot, and more slowly still after the 

 velocities at which the shot would break up had been attained. The 

 author has observed from direct experiment that the crater still retains 

 its round form even when the impact of the projectile is as far removed 

 from the vertical as twenty degrees ; the only noticeable effect being 

 the greater shattering of the side of the crater against which the angle 

 of impact caiLses the projectile to bear with most pressure in its 

 penetration. These experiments were made with a high power, 

 small-bore rifle, having an initial velocity of about 2,300 feet per 

 second.

Confirmatory Evidence Obtained by Deeper Exploration 

 Inside Crater. 



As, in the judgment of the author and Mr. Barringer, the outside 

 indications all agreed with the theory that the crater had been pro- 

 duced by the impact of a great meteor, it was determined to explore 

 the interior for additional confirmation of this fact and also to endeavor 

 to reach the main mass of such meteor. In pursuance of this object 

 five small prospecting shafts have been put down of depths varying 

 from 30 to 200 feet, and also five bore holes from 305 to 1 ,003 feet in 

 depth. Although none of these has struck the main body of the meteor, 

 ample confirmatory evidence of the theory of the meteoric formation 

 of this hole has been obtained. 



Rock in place in the bottom of the hole has been struck, in the opinion 

 of the author, in two places. First, in shaft No. 2, 510 feet from the 

 center of the hole, in a direction fifteen degrees north of east from the 

 said center and at a depth of 147 feet; and secondly, in bore hole No. 

 5, at a distance of 250 feet southeast of said center, at a depth of 890 

 feet. The shaft penetrated the rock in place fifty-three feet and the 

 bore hole 113 feet. In the shaft the rock, while undoubtedly in place, 

 had been so crushed and disintegrated that its substance was that of a 

 bed of loose sand. But the planes and marks of stratification were 

 complete and unbroken and showed an upturning of the crushed, pre- 

 viously level strata to an angle of about forty-five degrees in a direction 

 away from a point slightly north of the center of the hole. In other 

 words, this rock in place dipped downward and outward, closely corre- 

 sponding to the rock exposed in the walls of the crater above, but was 

 much more shattered and disintegrated. 



The rock in place, penetrated by the drill hole, could be distinguished 

 only by its hardness, and, of course, its condition could not be examined. 

 In both cases the rock was sedimentary sandstone without any sign 

 of heat action whatever, either volcanic or by the action of hot water. 



The general description of the filling material in the deeper portions 

 of the hole is as follows: For a distance of 60 to 100 feet from the 

 present bottom of the crater, about its center, the hole is filled with 

 sedimentary material evidently deposited in the bottom of shallow 

 water. It is stratified horizontally, as though the sediments had been 

 washed down from the surrounding walls, either by successive wet 

 seasons or successive violent rain storms, and has been deposited in 

 approximately level sheets by wave action in shallow water. This 

 stratified material is full of small shells of various kinds, and contains 




904 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



a number of hard level strata a few inches in depth running through it, 

 as though at times the water liad disappeared and the sediments had 

 become baked and indurated by exposure to the sun. Around the 

 sides of the crater this sedimentary filling is much shallower, and its 

 bottom is marked by a bed of broken rock talus which extends out- 

 ward from the edge of the central plain, dipping towards the center at 

 about six or seven degrees. How far this talus extends is unknown, 

 but at 400 feet from the edge of the central plain it is forty-seven feet 

 beneath the surface and about twenty feet thick. In the neighbor- 

 hood of the center of the hole this sheet of broken rock does not exist 

 over an undetermined area, in which the sedimentary deposit was con- 

 siderably deeper than around the edges to the depth above noted. 

 Below the sedimentary deposits in this central area, and underneath 

 the talus elsewhere, the crater is filled with powdered rock of an almost 

 impalpable fineness. In some places this is snow-white and contains 

 over 99.5 per cent, silica. Elsewhere it is of a slightly yellowish tinge, 

 and in places is cemented together by redeposited carbonate of lime. 

 Down to 300 feet below the interior plain there is no change in this 

 material. Through it is scattered sparingly fragments, more or less 

 shattered, of the three strata penetrated by the hole, namely, red sand- 

 stone, yellow limestone and white sandstone. There is no order of their 

 deposition, but the three materials are mixed indiscriminately. In 

 shaft No. 2, however, at a depth of sixty-seven feet, there is a series of 

 boulders, scattered rather thickly through the powdered silica for about 

 twenty-five feet in depth, in which the natural order of occurrence of 

 the rocks is exactly inverted. That is, fragments of the surface red 

 sandstone are the deepest, above which come fragments of the middle 

 strata of yellow limestone and at the top are situated fragments of the 

 deepest strata of white sandstone. This formation suggests the idea 

 of the surface material, having first received the impact of the meteorite, 

 started first on its aerial flight, followed by the lower materials in turn 

 as they were reached, and retained this order when falling back into 

 the hole as it was being filled up. 



In the central portions of the hole, below 300 feet, the proportion of 

 broken and unbroken sand grains among the powdered silica begins 

 to increase perceptibly, and slightly below this point meteoric material, 

 of a character which will be described below, begins to be noticeable. 

 The filling material continues to get coarser and coarser and contains 

 more and more meteoric material with the increasing depth until the 

 500-foot level is reached. This point is 900 feet below the former level 

 of thejocky plain at this point and about 1,100 feet below the crest of 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PPIILADELPHIA. 905 



the rim at its highest point. At the 500-foot level there is but little 

 powdered silica; the material is mostly of broken and unbroken sand 

 grains. Below this point the powdered rock is again met with which is 

 very fine. It is almost, but not quite, as fine as at the surface. This 

 change occurs quite suddenly and is accompanied with a progressive 

 scarcity of meteoric material which is completely absent at 550 feet. 

 From this point down there is again a gradual increase in whole and 

 broken sand grains contained in the material, and at 860 feet it changes 

 color quite suddenly to a reddish-brown sand, which at 890 feet, from 

 the sudden change in hardness and the difficulty of drilling, is almost 

 certainly rock in place. This continues to the fartherest point reached, 

 namely, 1,003 feet below the level of the interior plain. 



It is submitted that, regardless of the fact of whether or not the last 

 100 feet is solid rock or not, that the material penetrated for the last 

 150 feet must be rock in place ; for this reason : The change from white 

 sand to reddish-brown sand is quite marked and sudden, and if this 

 material had been stirred up by the passage of any projectile through 

 it, it would have been so mixed as to be indistinguishable, or at any 

 rate would certainly not have had a definite boundary line between the 

 two materials. For 180 feet below the surface of the plain the filling 

 material is absolutely dry. At this point dampness is perceptible, 

 which increases with the depth until at 200 feet the material is nearly 

 saturated with water ; which fact determined the stoppage of the shafts 

 at this point and the use of well-drilling apparatus for the deeper 

 explorations. 



Meteoric Material Found in the Lower Portions of the Hole. 



The meteoric material found, mixed with filling material, in the hole 

 from the 300- to 500-foot levels is of the following kinds : First, mag- 

 netite in the form of scales, closely resembling hammer slag produced 

 by a blacksmith in welding and forging iron. These films occur in 

 varying proportions among the sand. Second, of more sparing occur- 

 rence are small particles of brownish magnetite, resembling that picked 

 up on the surface. Third, sand grains wholly or partially coated with 

 magnetite and small bunches of sand grains cemented together with 

 magnetite. The first and third forms have undoubtedly solidified from 

 a state of fusion ; the first alone, and the latter when the fused magnetite 

 came in contact with one or more grains of the sand. The appearance 

 of this last form under the microscope is precisely that of broken stone 

 smeared with, and cemented together by, such a fused material as 

 asphalt when prepared for the foundation of an asphalt street. Second, 




906 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



silicate of iron in forms exactly duplicating the first and third forms of 

 the magnetite above specified; that is, in films and adhering to sand 

 grains. This material was at first thought to be magnetite on account 

 of its exact similarity in appearance, except that it was of rather a 

 darker color. But it was distinguished from magnetite by observing 

 its almost complete indifference to the magnet. Analysis confirms 

 this fact, and these blackish scales leave a snow-white skeleton of gela- 

 tinous silica of the shape and size of the original fragment on prolonged 

 boiling in hydrochloric acid. 



It is supposed that this material was formed when the fused mag- 

 netite and silica from the powdered rock were mixed together at a heat 

 sufficient to cause combination. Both these forms contain but a very 

 small proportion of nickel, and as they both occur below the water 

 level in the silica it is probable that the greater portion of the nickel 

 has been leached out of them, on account of the greater solubility of 

 the nickel oxide and the extreme fineness of subdivision of the material. 

 Third, there has been found among the filling material in a few localities, 

 but much more sparingly than the magnetite or the silicate of iron, 

 small round globules of metallic iron surrounded by an envelope of 

 magnetite. These small globules range from one-twenty-fifth to one- 

 fiftieth of an inch in diameter. While it is conceivable that silicate of 

 iron and magnetite might occur in the wreck of terrestrial strata of the 

 character found in this locality, it is extremely improbable, because 

 there is no trace of any of this material in the unpulverized rock form- 

 ing the strata in question. But it is absolutely inconceivable that these 

 little metallic spheres with their coating of magnetite could exist in 

 any sedimentary strata, such as alone occur in this locality. Small 

 particles of terrestrial metallic iron have, as is well known, been found 

 in certain localities, but not in rock of this nature. And they could 

 not have resisted complete oxidation if the original rock in which they 

 were found had been weathered away and its material sul^sequently 

 formed into sandstone. Moreover, if they had resisted such complete 

 oxidation, the coating which would form around them would be ordi- 

 nary hydrated sesquioxide of iron and could not be magnetite. And 

 also such metallic iron as has been found in terrestrial strata has always 

 been found in strongly basic rocks. "Whereas the rocks in this locality 

 are extremely acid, in fact almost pure silica. 



Two other remarkable phenomena have been noted in the water 

 pumped from these bore holes. This water is clear and without taste 

 or odor, but it contains a small amount of flocculent gelatinous silica 

 floating in it. Also in several places, and it was noted that these places 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 907 



were at the levels at which most of the other meteoric material was 

 found, the first water drawn from the hole in the morning, after stand- 

 ing over night, was found to contain a very considerable amount of 

 dingy green protoxide of iron suspended in it, which upon exposure to 

 the air rapidly oxidized and became converted into a reddish-brown 

 hydrated sesquioxide. The only explanation that can be offered for 

 these phenomena is that, probably, the extremely thin films of silicate 

 of iron have had their iron dissolved by long immersion in water con- 

 taining carbonic acid, leaving their gelatinous silica skeletons suspended 

 in the water, and that the solution of carbonate of iron may later have 

 lost its carbonic acid in some way, possibly by absorption by lime from 

 the limestone strata, and precipitated out of the protoxide of iron which 

 remains in suspension in the water. It has also been noted that from 

 the deeper portions of the hole, below 600 feet, where the meteoric 

 material has not been found, that the sand itself showed a very minute 

 trace of nickel, which has probably come from the leached meteoric 

 material above it.^ 



The Possible Encounter of Larger Meteoric Material. 



The small prospecting shafts above referred to were stopped by 

 water at 200 feet before penetrating to levels at which later explora- 

 tions showed the meteoric material was to be encountered.- This 

 stoppage was caused by their small size and their light timbering, which 



' Since this article was written, the author has discovered the presence of a 

 small amount of very finely divided metallic iron among the silica. This has 

 been found, so far, in every sample examined, from the north and south rims as 

 well as from tlie filling of the central plain. It varies in amount, but its propor- 

 tion is extremely small. The largest amount has been found among the silica 

 from the filling of the crater, where it exists to the proportion of nearly a quarter 

 of an ounce to the ton. From the north and south rims the amount is less in 

 the order stated; from the south rim it does not amount to a twentieth as much 

 as from the interior of the crater. 



This metallic iron was detected, separated and estimated as follows: The 

 silica was passed through a magnetic separator and a very small amount of mag- 

 netic material of a dark color collected and weighed. A weighed portion of this 

 was carefully ground in an agate mortar, wet and the finely powdered material 

 washed away from time to time until the material was reduced to about one- 

 tenth of its original bulk. In this residue, by the use of a glass, could be ob- 

 served a great number of bright, white, shining metallic scales and spangles. 

 The}'- were strongly influenced by a magnet. A solution of copper sulphate was 

 then poured over this residue and the bright white spangles were observed to 

 turn dull red-copper color at once. The finer portions were then observed to 

 be indifferent to the magnet, although the larger ones were still attracted. On 

 prolonged treatment all became indifferent to the magnet. The residue was 

 then washed and the copper in it determined, there being none in it before 

 treatment. As a check the iron was determined in the copper sulphate solu- 

 tion used and wash waters, the solution being pure. Distinct traces of nickel 

 were also observed in this material.

rendered them unfit to penetrate strata in whicli pressure tending to 

 crush them would be encountered. The five bore holes were all put 

 down within a very small area. Their object was to find out how far 

 down this hole extends. This object was attained by the fifth alone. 

 Three of the previous holes were stopped by encountering substances 

 which, although not determined with certainty, were in all probability 

 larger fragments of the great meteor. The first was found in bore hole 

 No. 1 under the following circumstances : This hole had been put down 

 about 300 feet, being four inches in diameter, when the piping stuck, 

 and a two and one-half inch pipe was then put down to 420 feet and 

 there stuck. A one and one-fourth inch pipe had been put down 630 

 feet and withdrawn owing to a change in drillers. The hole thus 

 remained idle for some ten days. On resuming work it was found to 

 be filled up to about 380 feet, that is to about forty feet above the 

 end of the two and one-half inch casing. When the drilling was resumed 

 the small pipe very rapidly cleared out the casing and the hole below 

 until it arrived at 480 feet, where it encountered an obstacle that could 

 not be penetrated, although the hole had previously been 150 feet 

 deeper. Against this obstacle the drill was kept rotating two days. 

 It was so hard that it was penetrated less than two inches and would 

 dull the drills almost immediately. It was while rotating upon this 

 obstacle that brown magnetite, resembling that found upon the surface, 

 was gotten from the hole and also the greater number of little iron 

 spheres with magnetite coverings. The obstacle proved impossible 

 to penetrate, and it was attempted to remove it by jetting large quanti- 

 ties of water and also dropping the bit upon it as hard as could be done 

 with so small and weak a line of pipe as one and one-fourth inch, and 

 by this means it was after a long time forced down nearly a foot, thus 

 proving that it was a comparatively small object. As it was impos- 

 sible to get through it or around it, this hole was then abandoned. The 

 one solution of this matter can be that the hole passed very close to a 

 small fragment of meteoric iron or magnetite when it was first put down, 

 and that the subsequent washing of water through the hole had loosened 

 up this object, which subsequently, by the caving of the hole, slid across 

 it and effectually stopped further progress. The next hole. No. 2, was 

 stopped in much the same manner by an obstacle of apparently the 

 same character at 300 feet. This hole was, however, using a four-inch 

 pipe, and on this account and its less depth the object was much more 

 accessible. Much less magnetite and other meteoric material was 

 obtained from this obstacle than from that in No. 1. It wore out the 

 tempered steel drills in the same way. A drill with chisel edge was 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 909 



then put in and the strong and heavy pipe Une, weighing about 3,500 

 pounds, was then dropped on this obstruction a great number of times. 

 It was driven a very small fraction of an inch each time, possibly 

 between two and one-half and three inches in all. The pipe line was 

 dropped about eight feet each time, which was as much as it would 

 stand without collapsing. And each time the drill struck the obstruc- 

 tion it would ring with a clear metallic sound and rebound some eigh- 

 teen inches to two feet. This was almost certain proof of the metallic 

 nature of the obstacle, as stone would have crushed and given a dead 

 impact without appreciable rebound. 



A small magnet of about half pound in weight was then lowered 

 down the hole on the end of a string. This magnet repeatedly attached 

 itself to the sides of the iron casing in going down, so that ample oppor- 

 tunity was offered to feel the pull necessary to detach it from adhering 

 by its own magnetism to a piece of unmagnetized iron. The pipe casing 

 during this trial was lifted some fifteen to twenty feet above the ob- 

 struction. When the magnet passed below the end of the pipe casing 

 it descended perfectly free until it reached the bottom, where it attached 

 itself very firmly to whatever object obstructed the hole, and required 

 a pull of several times as much force to detach it as was necessary to 

 detach it from adhering to the pipe casing at nearly the same depth, 

 and consequently with nearly the same weight of line supporting it. 

 This was repeated many times and there was no doubt about the facts 

 as stated. It was then endeavored to get an impression of the bottom 

 of the hole, but suitable material was not at hand and the impression 

 was not very satisfactory, although it seemed to show a flat bottom 

 to the hole with a crack about one and one-fourth inches wide and of 

 unknown depth with roughly parallel edges across the bottom of the 

 hole. This shape was not like anything observed on any of the surface 

 irons, but was less like what might be expected in a rock boulder. 

 This crack caught the drills and made it almost impossible to rotate 

 upon this obstruction. The magnet brought up a small quantity of 

 iron chips, some of which were undoubtedly from the pipe, having been 

 cut from it by the machinery for rotating it, but others seemed of 

 different nature and fracture from either pipe chips or the steel of the 

 drill, which, moreover, had not lost material of this size and shape. 

 They were thought to be meteoric iron. On analysis the mixed me- 

 tallic iron gave .4 per cent, of nickel. As the greater proportion of this 

 iron was undoubtedly composed of pipe chips, free from nickel, this 

 was thought to be strongly confirmatory of the probability of the fact 

 that the doubtful material was actually meteoric iron. 




910 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC. 



The pipe was then withdi'awn and three sticks of No. 1 d3'namite 

 put down into the hole, in contact with this obstruction, and there 

 exploded. This explosion, which w^oiild have certainly shattered any 

 boulder small enough to have been driven by the pipe line even in the 

 open air and much more so under 100 feet of water tamping, had no 

 effect whatever upon the obstruction, except to drive it downward 

 about two inches ; and when the pipe was put back into the hole and 

 again dropped on the obstruction it still bounced and rang as before. 

 This hole was then abandoned. Hole No. 4 encountered an obstacle 

 of this kind at aljout 400 feet which threatened to stop the hole. But 

 from the wear of the drills it was suspected that the obstacle did not 

 cut off all of the hole, and it was found that a two and one-half inch pipe 

 would pass this olDstruction which had stopped a four-inch pipe, and 

 this hole was continued down to 600 feet where it was lost for other 

 causes. The last hole. No. 5, did not encounter any such obstacle and 

 was the only one which attained the object of all of them, namely, 

 to find if possible the bottom of the hole. This object having been 

 attained and the five prospecting bore holes proving exceedingly tedi- 

 ous and expensive and the results more or less uncertain, it was deter- 

 mined to abandon this method of proceeding and put down a shaft 

 properly ec^uipped for penetrating the wet ground. This has been done 

 to a depth of ISO feet, and further progress now awaits the installation 

 of the machinery. 



The author feels that he can announce the following facts as abso- 

 lutely proved: 



First : That at this locality there is a great hole or crater in the earth 

 which corresponds in all respects, except in its gigantic scale, with 

 impact craters formed in rock by projectiles of considerable size mov- 

 ing at considerable velocities. 



Second : That in and around this hole and below its bottom to a 

 distance of over 1,400 feet below the present surface of the plain sur- 

 rounding it, and the original surface of the place where this hole was 

 formed, every indication of either volcanic or hot spring action is posi- 

 tively absent. 



Third : That in and about this hole all signs which might be expected 

 of the impact of such a great projectile are present. 



Fourth : That upon the surface of the rim and upon the surrounding 

 plain there has been found and still exists a large quantity of meteoric 

 material, and that the distribution of this material is symmetrical with 

 a line passing through the center of this hole. 



Fifth : That this meteoric material was deposited at the same instant 

 of time at which the hole was made. 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 911 



Sixth: That in and around this hole is an enormous quantity of 

 pulverized rock, produced from the strata penetrated by the hole, in a 

 state of subdivision which can be produced by a violent blow, but 

 cannot be produced by forms of natural erosion. 



Seventh : That there can have been no form of natural erosion active 

 in this locality which would have produced this material and have 

 collected it and retained it in the position in which found. 



Eighth: That meteoric material has been found among the filling 

 material of this hole at a depth of 900 feet below the surface of the 

 original plain, and 500 feet below the present bottom of the crater, 

 and 400 feet below the surface of the material which fell back into the 

 crater at the instant of its formation. 



Ninth : That all of the attendant minor phenomena observed can be 

 explained upon the theory of the impact of a great projectile, and none 

 can be satisfactorily explained upon any other theory. 



In view of these positively established facts, the author feels that he 

 is justified, under due reserve as to subsequently developed facts, in 

 announcing that the formation at this locality is due to the impact of 

 a meteor of enormous and hitherto unprecedented size. 



Date of the Occurrence. 



Fortunately there is a means at hand of obtaining a very good idea 

 of the age or rather the extreme recentness of this phenomenon. That 

 is, aside from the evidence of the hole itself and the lack of erosion of 

 the sharp edges of the ejected rocks themselves, and this in a country 

 of desert sand and furious winds, in which all exposed rocks are rounded 

 and sculptured by wind erosion to a marked degree. This evidence 

 comes from a little red sandstone butte some half a mile north of the 

 north edge of the hole. This, as mentioned in the earlier part of this 

 paper, is a portion of what was once the covering rock of this country 

 and which can be seen at a glance to be in process of rapid removal. 

 Now it happens that a jet of the crushed material and broken rock a 

 little more vigorous than most has fallen across this butte, and it can 

 be traced up the near slope and across the top. Then there is an inter- 

 val of fifty feet or so in the lee of the hill upon which none was deposited 

 owing to its horizontal velocity, and then it begins again on the plain 

 beyond for a few hundred feet until it terminates. Now this deposit 

 up the near or southern side of the butte, in spite of the evidently rapid 

 erosion to which it is subject, lies on the surface right up to the cap, 

 without any red sandstone material having fallen or having been 

 washed down upon it. From its appearance it might have been depos- 




912 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



ited yesterday. This will give a superior limit of time within which 

 the fall must have occurred from whatever rate may be assigned to the 

 erosion of the red sandstone buttes. The author would name 10,000 

 years as the utmost possible limit which could be allowed, and feels 

 that this is much too liberal and that something well inside of 5,000 

 years is much more nearly in accordance with the facts. In fact, so 

 recent is the appearance of everything in this locality that some stunted 

 cedars, growing on the rim and showing year rings of over 700 years of 

 growth, are not without value in placing a minimum limit within which 

 the fall cannot have occurred. 



Size of the Meteorite Forming the Hole. 



Of this it is extremely difficult to form any idea from data which 

 would stand critical exainination. Professor Gilbert put the necessary 

 minimum as the equivalent of a sphere of 750 feet in diameter, and 

 the probable size as equivalent to a sphere of 1,500 feet in diameter. 

 This seems to the author as most excessive. The problem contains 

 too many unknown factors to make calculation much, if any, better 

 than guesswork. The following facts may be considered as having 

 some bearing in assigning a possible maximum size to the projectile. 

 The artillery tables above referred to give a penetration of something 

 less than two diameters in solid limestone rock for shot at about 1,800 

 feet per second. Xow, from the prol^able absence of meteoric material 

 in the hole below 500 feet, this is assumed as about its limit of penetra- 

 tion. This corresponds to a penetration of about 900 feet of solid rock 

 on the whole considerably softer than limestone, and would therefore 

 correspond to a sphere of considerably less than 450 feet in diameter, 

 if the velocity were not in excess of 1,800 feet per second. Xow what 

 this striking velocity was can only be guessed at, although it is abso- 

 lutely certain that it was in excess of 1,800 feet per second, in all proba- 

 bility many times in excess of this figure; and it must be kept in mind 

 that the energy would increase as the square of the velocity, and that 

 the cubic contents of the hole excavated would vary directly with the 

 energy exerted. Therefore if the velocity was 9,000 feet per second, or 

 five times that quoted above, a sphere of one-twenty-fifth the weight of 

 the above would deliver the same amount of energy and therefore prob- 

 ably make the same sized hole. The original velocity of any such body 

 is reasonably well known from astronomical considerations and it prob- 

 ably struck the atmosphere at between nine and forty-five miles per 

 second, depending upon the direction of its motion in relation to the 

 motion of the earth. We know that this excessive velocitv is verv soon 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 913 



dissipated in the smaller meteorites and that they strike the earth with 

 a very moderate velocity ; but could such a thin layer as the atmosphere 

 deal in the same manner with a large body? The author is of the 

 opinion that it could not, and that this body probably struck with a 

 large part of its planetary velocity, and that it was extremely small in 

 comparison with anything that would be deduced by assuming for it 

 any such striking velocity as has ever been produced in a terrestrial 

 projectile; but as and for the reason set forth above, he does not feel 

 justified from any known data in naming any definite figure in con- 

 nection therewith. 



The Composition of the Meteorite. 



The composition of the outer surface, at least, of this meteorite is 

 fairly well known and appears to have been fairly constant. For the 

 great numbers of specimens picked up around the hole, which must 

 have come indiscriminately from all points of the surface, are of fairly 

 constant composition. That is, metallic iron with very small percent- 

 ages of carbon, sulphur and phosphorus, with between seven and eight 

 per cent, of nickel and a trace of cobalt. This metallic mass carries 

 about three-fourths of an ounce per ton of platinum and iridium. 



As to the interior composition of the meteorite, nothing definite can 

 be known. If the body was a fragment the probability is that it was 

 homogeneous throughout, as there is little or no difference between 

 the fragments from all portions of its surface. If, however, the object 

 was a small spheroid its interior might differ considerably from that of 

 its exterior. It seems improbable that the mass contained any notable 

 proportion of stony material, as nothing of this kind has been observed 

 in the fragments around the rim, nor has prolonged and careful micro- 

 scopic examination of a very large number of samples of the filling 

 material of the hole from all depths shown anything but the broken 

 debris of the strata penetrated, except the above-mentioned meteoric 

 material, which is all either metallic iron or the direct results of its 

 combustion or union of such products of combustion with the surround- 

 ing silica. It is, however, to be noted that a small stone meteorite of 

 several pounds in weight, containing metallic iron sparsely scattered 

 through it, was picked up by i\Ir. Barringer about two miles from the 

 crater. There is, however, excellent reason for the belief that this 

 object was observed to fall during the winter of 1903. In any event, 

 although the iron contains a proportion of nickel somewhat less than 

 that in the fragments of the great meteorite, yet, after careful and 

 repeated examinations, it has been proved that the metals of the plati- 

 59 




914 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



niim group are certainly absent from this material. Now, although it 

 is conceivable that a stony meteorite containing metallic iron might 

 \mder some circumstances, such as prolonged heating in a reducing 

 atmosphere, acquire a superficial coating of iron, yet it is entirely 

 inconceivable that such a coating, concentrated upon the surface from 

 a stony interior, could contain a definite and constant proportion of 

 metals of the platinum group and yet leave the iron still contained in 

 the mass entirely without any such constituents. Mr. Barringer's 

 account of these unusual formations at Coon Butte immediately pre- 

 cedes this paper.

The following reports were ordered to be printed : 



REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



The regular stated meetings of the year, amounting to sixteen, 

 were held, the average attendance being 26. Communications were 

 made by Messrs. Wetherill, Pilsbry, Harshberger, Crawley, Conklin, 

 Skinner, A. E. Brown, A. P. Brown, Phillips, S. Brown, Rhoads, Van 

 Ingen, Stone, vSharp, Lightfoot, Janney, Jennings and Miss Walter. 



Forty-five papers were presented for publication as follows: Henry 

 W. Fowler, 6; H. A. Pilsbry and E. G. Vanatta, 5; Clarence B. Moore, 4; 

 J. Percy Moore, 4; James A. G. Rehn, 4; Howard Crawley, 2; H. A.

 Barringer, 1, and Benjamin C. Tilghman, 1. 



Four of these, by Clarence B. Moore, constitute the second part of 

 the thirteenth volume of the Journal, for which, with its copious 

 illustrations, we are indebted to the author. Of the others, 29 have 

 been published in the current volume of the Proceedings, of which two 

 numbers have been issued, and four are in course of publication; 

 three were withdrawn, two were transferred to the Entomological 

 Section, one was returned to the author and two remain to be acted on. 



Eight hundred and forty-eight pages of the Proceedings, illustrated 

 by 56 plates; 212 pages of the Journal, with 244 half-tone text figures 

 and 6 maps; 344 pages and 11 plates of the Entomological News, 296 

 pages and 7 plates of the Transactions of the American Entomological 

 Society (Entomological Section of the Academy) and 138 pages and 51 

 plates of the Manual of Conchology have been published. 



In January postal card notices were sent to the members of the 

 Academy requesting those who desired to receive the Proceedings to 

 signify such desire on a return card. The result was such a decrease 

 in the mailing list that the published edition was reduced to 1,200.

Ten members and four correspondents have been elected. The 

 ■deaths of fourteen members and six correspondents have been an- 

 nounced. Seven members have resigned as follows: Julia S. Robins, 

 Ferdinand PhiUps, Henry Beates, Jr., James K. Clarke, William T. 

 ■Shoemaker, F. S. Manderson and Ralph W. Seiss. 



Mr. Effingham B. Morris was appointed by the Council, October 30, 

 a member of the Committee on Finance, to fill the vacancy caused by 

 the death of General Isaac J. Wistar. 



The Hayden Memorial Geological Award was, on the recommenda- 

 tion of the Council and the special committee, unanimously voted to 

 Charles Doolittle Walcott, LL.D., November 7, in recognition of the 

 value of his individual contributions to geological science and the 

 •efficiency of his service as Director of the United States Geological 

 '.Survey. The official notice of the award was duly forwarded to Dr. 

 Walcott, but the substantial token cannot be delivered immediately, 

 as the remodelling of the medal with an improved portrait and 

 design has been confided to a reliable artist who is now engaged upon 

 the work. It is confidently hoped that the result will be much more 

 satisfactory than the medal heretofore conferred. 



My thanks are due to those associated with me on the Publication 

 Committee, and especially to the President, for the kindest help and 

 cooperation during a prolonged and trying illness in the spring.

 Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



By custom and as a result of the plan upon which the Academy is 

 organized, the bulk of its correspondence is now conducted by the 

 several departments directly concerned. The duties of the Corres- 

 ponding Secretary have been thereby lightened until the correspond- 

 ence remaining under his charge is nearly limited to formal and routine 

 matters. The most important duty retained by this office is the 

 custody of the records of correspondents. In connection with this an 

 effort is being made to keep in touch with the distinguished scientists 

 whom it has been this Academy's privelege to honor. 




1905.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 917 



Other than through the Hayden Medal the award of which is re- 

 stricted both in frequency and field of application, election to corres- 

 ponding membership is the only dignified means at the disposal of the 

 Academy by which its recognition of scientific eminence can be ex- 

 pressed. It is a most important function of well-established scientific 

 institutions to seek out students who have made discoveries of excep- 

 tional merit and to honor and encourage them. But the value of such 

 approval is measured by the care and discrimination with which it is 

 given. If placed indiscriminately upon work of both great and small 

 worth it soon becomes cheapened and degraded to the lower level ; but 

 if a high standard be continuously maintained both the giver and the 

 recipient of the honor gain in dignity. In awarding the correspond- 

 ent's diploma it seems most important that the Academy should keep 

 these principles ever in view, and in no case permit its standard of 

 excellence to be lowered. 



During the past year Charles D. Walcott, George T. Moore,, John 

 Sterling Kingsley and Harry Fielding Reid were elected correspond- 

 ents and the first named was awarded the Hayden Medal in gold. 



The deaths during the year of the following correspondents were 

 announced from the chair: Alpheus Spring Packard, Alfred Preud- 

 homme de Borre, Henri di Saussure, Victor Raulin, Baron Ferdinand 

 von Richthofen, and Albert von Koelliker. 



Eight notices of the death of prominent scientific men were received 

 and acknowledged on behalf of the Academy by suitable letters of 

 sympathy. Congratulatory letters were forwarded to the Entomo- 

 logical Society of Belgium and the Natural History Society of Schles- 

 wig-Holstein upon the occasions of the celebration of the fiftieth anni- 

 versary of their founding; and to the University of Illinois upon the 

 installation of President Edmund James. From the Sullivant Moss 

 Chapter and the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Tuber- 

 culosis were received letters thanking the Academy for the use of rooms 

 in which their meetings were held. Letters of appreciation and thanks 

 for courtesies extended to them were also received from several of 

 the scientific societies which met in Philadelphia during Convocation 

 Week of 1904. 



Invitations to the Academy to send delegates were received from 

 the Presidential Installation Committee of the University of Illinois 

 and from three international congresses of learning. The interest of 

 the Academy in the proceedings and its regret at being unable to send 

 delegates were in each case expressed in due form. 



Various letters requesting information, the loan of .specimens, or

 officers of the Academy.

Sixteen hundred and ninety-seven volumes have been bound, and an 

 additional 204 are now in the hands of the binders. This work places 

 the library in a better condition than it has ever been before, although 

 there still remain a large number of unbound volumes in the Section 

 of Transactions and Periodicals. It is hoped that most of these will 

 receive attention during the coming year. In connection with the 

 binding constant effort is made, in many cases with gratifying success, 

 to complete imperfect volumes and sets. 



A shelf-list of the Transactions and Periodicals, the necessity of 

 which was referred to in my last report and which, when finished, will 

 complete this form of record of the contents of the library, has pro- 

 gressed as rapidly as the very limited clerical assistance available will 

 permit. No losses have been ascertained during the past year. 



The necessity for more room in some of the departments is pressing. 

 As a temporary relief shelves have been placed on some of the cases, 

 but this arrangement is very undesirable, as the books can only be 

 reached with the aid of a ladder. It is hoped that some means of pro- 

 viding for growth, which will avoid the inconvenience of high shelves 

 without an undue disturbance of the present arrangement of the books, 

 may be adopted by the Library Committee. 



It is scarcely necessary to say that the card catalogue is kept up to 

 date, the smallest pamphlets, even when they are excerpts from journals 

 already in the possession of the Academy, being promptly recorded.

Dr. Sharp reports that 64 shdes have been purchase<.l and that Dr. 

 H. A. Pilsbry has presented 14, making the number of shdes in the col- 

 lection 1,447. The Schaeffer collection of some 2,000 slides have not 

 yet been catalogued. It is hoped that this will be done during the 

 coming spring. 



It gives me pleasure to acknowledge my obligation to my assistant, 

 William J. Fox, for efficient service, both in the Library and in the issue 

 and distribution of the Academy's publications, during my attendance 

 at the meeting of the American Library Association in Portland, 

 Oregon, and earlier in the year during a prolonged and, for a time, 

 critical illness.

REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The collections in the care of the Curators are in excellent condition, 

 and during the year just passed much progress has been made in their 

 study and arrangement. 



Repairs have been made to the heating plant and to the roofs, while 

 an appropriation of $20,000 from the State Legislature during the last 

 regular session has made it possible to take preliminary steps toward 

 several important improvements to the building, to be carried out 

 early in the coming j^ear, comprising chiefly an entirely new roof for 

 the older building. 



A telephone system connecting the different offices and depart- 

 ments has been installed. 



Six new exhibition cases, uniform with those previously provided, 

 and furnishing in all 500 square feet of exhibition space, have been 

 erected for the display of the mounted mammals and birds, Mr. 

 Clarence B, Moore has added another handsome case to accommodate 

 the recent accessions to his archaeological collections. 



A number of wooden storage cases with panel doors have been pro- 

 cured for skins of large mammals and birds and a similar series of 

 smaller cases for mollusks. Many air-tight tin cases have also been 

 provided for storage of small birds and insects, as well as 245 Schmitt 

 insect boxes. 



During the year Mr. Clarence B. Moore has continued his investiga- 

 tions of the Indian mounds of the Gulf States and has added a number 

 of valuable and unique specimens to his collection. Foremost among 




922 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



these is a remarkably beautiful stone vessel, bearing a representation of 

 a duck's head rising from the rim, which was discovered near Mound- 

 ville, Ala. 



Early in the year Mt. Samuel N. Rhoads was sent out in the interests 

 of the Academy to explore the lower Colorado river and adjacent 

 parts of Lower California, Owing to unprecedented floods in the 

 region the expedition was not so successful as had been expected, but 

 a valuable collection of birds and mammals was secured. 



Dr. Henry Skinner spent the greater part of the summer in the 

 Huachuca Mountains of southern Arizona collecting for the Museum, 

 and brought back a series of 2,500 insects of exceptional interest as 

 well as a number of valuable reptiles and mollusks. 



Through the liberality of Mr. Morgan Hebard, ^Ir. J. A. G. Rehn 

 was enabled to accompany him on a trip through central Florida col- 

 lecting Orthoptera, half of the entire series of 4,000 specimens becoming 

 the property of the Academy. 



Mr. Stewardson Brown, through an arrangement with the New York 

 Botanic Garden, was also enabled to visit Bermuda with the Director, 

 Dr. N. L. Britton, and a full series of their joint collection, probably 

 the best yet made on the island, has been added to the Academy's 

 Herbarium. 



Among the additions to the Museum during the year especial men- 

 tion must be made of a notable series of about 500 birds from British 

 East Africa, collected by Mr. George L. Harrison, Jr., and deposited 

 in the Academy. 



A collection of marine animals on the Florida coast by Mr. George 

 Wood, a series of reptiles obtained for the Academy in Kansas by Mr. 

 C. T. Sands, and a valuable collection of mollusks procured in eastern 

 Cuba by Dr. H. M. Hiller, were also added to the collections. 



Detailed accounts of the year's work in several departments are 

 appended. In addition to these, the task of attaching tin tags bearing 

 the catalogue numbers to the entire series of reptiles and batrachians 

 has been completed by Messrs. Rehn and Lorrilliere. The smaller 

 mammalian skulls have also been labelled and systematically arranged, 

 while a rearrangement of a large part of the study series of mammal 

 skins has been effected. 



Mr. Fowler has continued the identification and arrangement of the 

 fishes, besides making large collections of local species. Dr. J. Percy 

 Moore has continued his study and care of the Helminthological col- 

 lection, and Miss H. N. Wardle has made progress in the cataloguing 

 of the archaeological material . 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 923 



A number of mammals received from the Zoological Society of Phila- 

 delphia have been mounted or prepared as study specimens in the 

 Taxidermical department, notable among the former being a bull 

 American Bison, a Wild Boar and a Bubaline Antelope. 



Besides the services rendered by the Museum staff and the students 

 of the Jessup Fund, the Curators are indebted to Dr. P. P. Calvert, 

 Messrs. Erich Daecke, H. W. Wenzel, H. L. Yiereck and E. T. Cresson, 

 Jr., for aid in the Entomological department, and Mr. S. S. Van Pelt in 

 the Herbarium. 



The Anti-Tuberculosis Society, Philadelphia Botanical Club, Dela- 

 ware Valley Ornithological Club and the Entomological Club of the 

 American Association for the Advancement of Science have held 

 meetings at the Academy during the year. At the time of the meeting 

 of the latter body in Philadelphia a general meeting of entomologists 

 was held at the Academy with a view to forming a national organiza- 

 tion, and a reception was given by the Botanical Section to the visiting 

 botanists. 



The collections have been constantly studied by visiting specialists, 

 and during the year material has been loaned to Walter K. Fisher, E. 

 L. Morris, Miss H. Richardson, Carlton R. Ball, Paul Bartch, C. V. 

 Piper, E. W. Nelson, F. C. Paulmier, W. H. Osgood, E. B. Williamson,

Report of the Special Curator of the Department of Mollusca. 



The collections of mollusca remain in good order, through from the 

 crowded condition of the department the specimens of some groups are 

 not as accessible as we would desire. The installation of a series of 

 storage cases has given room for a rearrangement of the fresh-water 

 mussels, which have been reclassified in accordance with Mr. Simpson's 

 recent synopis of the group, and now occupy about 850 square feet of 

 space. Several extensive families of small land snails have been 

 removed from the exhibition series and rearranged in storage cases, 

 leaving merely a few t3^pical species to represent them in the public 

 exhibit. The series of American land snails, rearranged and expanded, 

 is in storage cases, occupying about 600 square feet. The rapid growth 

 of the collection has continued. Mr. Y. Hirase, of Kyoto, has con- 

 tinued his sendings of Japanese mollusca, comprising many new forms. 




924 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



We have also been favored with a set of duplicates of Japanese fresh- 

 water bivalves from the Imperial Museum at Tokyo, 



The study of the mollusca collected by Mr. J. H. Ferriss and the 

 Curator in the Southwestern expedition of 1903 has now been com- 

 pleted and a full report thereon prepared. The collections made in 

 the Southwest by Dr. H. Skinner, T. D. A. Cockerell, Joshua and Albert 

 Baily and others have been included in this report. 



A series of Alabama mollusks, supplementing that obtained last year, 

 has been purchased from the veteran collector, H. H. Smith. 



Numerous members of the Academy and correspondents of the 

 Curator have also contributed largely to the collection. A list of these 

 gifts is given in the Accessions to the Museum. 



Seventeen papers, based chiefly upon new material, have been pub- 

 lished during the year by the Special and Assistant Curators of the 

 department. • 



All of the Pliocene invertebrate fossils in our possession have been 

 gathered together and installed in two large cases in the gallery for- 

 merly occupied by birds. 



A large part of the Special Curator's time has been occupied with the 

 preparation and publication of the Manual of Concfiology, in which 

 the family Achatinidoe is dealt with. 



Mr. E. G. Vanatta has continued his efficient work as assistant in 

 the department throughout the year.

REPORTS OF THE SECTIONS. 



The Mineralogical and Geological Section. 



t 



The Section has this year with increased zeal and yet better results 

 continued its meetings and field excursions. 



There have been nine meetings, with an average attendance of over 

 14. Communications were made by Dr. Florence Bascom, on the 

 Piedmont belt of Pennsylvania, and on the crystalline rocks of the 

 Coatesville and Phoenixville Quadrangle; by Mr. Gilbert Van Ingen, on 

 fossils of southwestern Arkansas (illustrated by lantern slides) ; by Mr. 

 S. H. Hamilton, on moulders' sands; by Mr. F. Lynwood Garrison, on 

 Santo Domingo (illustrated by lantern slides) ; by Miss Mary S. Holmes, 

 on asphaltum in California; by Dr. Benjamin L. Miller, on the geology 




1905.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 925 



of eastern Virginia; by Mr. T. G. Ridpath, on deep wells near Philadel- 

 phia; and a dozen shorter communications with various discussions. 



There were 6 field excursions, with an average attendance of about 

 33. The parties visited: 1. Upper Cretaceous beds within a dozen 

 miles southeast of Camden, N. J.; 2. Crystalline rocks and their 

 minerals near the southern edge of Delaware County; 3. PortioiLS of 

 the New Red Gwynedd Shales and Norristown Shales, also Hudson 

 River Shales, all in Bucks County, near Chalfont, Doylestown and 

 Grenoble; 4. Portions of the New Red Norristown Shales and No. 11 

 Limestone in Buckingham Township, Bucks County; 5. Portions of 

 the New Red Norristown Shales, Perkasie Shales, Pottstown Shales and 

 trap near Lambertville, N. J. ; 6. Some mineral places in the crystal- 

 line rocks near West Chester. 



At the time of the Buckingham excursion some exceptionally inter- 

 esting fossil saurian bones were found in a hole dug at the expense of 

 the Section, under the guidance of Mr. John S. Ash, of Holicong, and 

 on his land. The Section has had the digging continued. Mr. William 

 J. Sinclair, of Princeton, has kindly undertaken the study of the bones, 

 and later on will report upon them to the Academy. 



The membership of the Section has increased by four — two members 

 and two contributors. 



The following officers of the Section have been elected for the year 

 1906: 



Director, 

 Vice-Director, 

 Recorder and Secretary, 

 Treasurer, .

The Biological and Microscopical Section. 



The Section held its usual monthly meetings with an increased 

 attendance and has also met on several occasions for informal discus- 

 sion. The members present have offered numerous specimens, both 

 mounted and unmounted, for exhibition, and several addresses have 

 been made, among which may be mentioned the following : 



Fisheries of the Dogger Bank, by Dr. Benjamin Sharp ; Micro-Chemical

Analysis, by Dr. Hemy Leffmann; Urinary Analysis, by Dr. Thomas 

 S. Stewart; The Abbe Theory of Microscopic Vision, by Mr. F. J. 

 Keeley. 



The Conservator reports, as an important addition to the collection 

 during the past year, a microscope which had belonged to Dr. Samuel 

 G. Morton, presented by Mrs. Thomas H. Montgomery. This instru- 

 ment, made by W. & S. Jones, of London, is of a type originating in 

 the latter part of the eighteenth century and not previously represented 

 in the Academy. Two Beck Star microscopes with objectives were pur- 

 chased, and a portrait of Dr. Abbe was presented by Mr. F. J. Keeley. 



The following officers were elected for the year 1906 :

The Entomological Section. 



The usuall ten monthly meetings have been held since the last report, 

 with an average attendance of twelve persons. 



Verbal communications have been made by nearly all the members 

 and associates of the Section. These have been permanently put on 

 record in the Entomological News. 



This journal has been continued and Volume XVI completed with 

 344 pages and 11 plates. Five tin cases and 40 boxes have been pur- 

 chased to care for the additions and for better and safer housing of 

 the collections in general. 



The Conservator spent five weeks collecting in the Huachuca ]\Ioun- 

 tains, Cochise County. Arizona, and brought back 3,000 specimens, a 

 number being new to science and many new to our cabinets. The 

 larger part of these have been incorporated into the collections of the 

 different orders of insects. Mr. G. C. Davis presented his valuable 

 collection of Ichneumonoidea, containing 3,617 specimens, including 

 his types. The entire additions during the year numbered 12,935 

 specimens. 



The collections are in an excellent state of preservation, largely

brought about by improvements in cases and boxes. The Conservator 

 gratefully acknowledges assistance from Dr. P. P. Calvert, Mr. J. A. G. 

 Rehn, Mr. E. T. Cresson, Jr., and Mr. Henry L. Viereck. One member 

 and three associates have been elected during the year. 



At a meeting held December 28, 1905, the following persons were 

 elected officers for the ensuing year :

The Botanical Section. 



The Botanical Section reports the collections at present to be in 

 excellent condition, the Conservator having devoted most of his time 

 to mounting and distributing the accumulation of material which has 

 been on hand for some years. Progress has been made in the mount- 

 ing of the Short Herbarium, and the MacElwee plants have been in large 

 part mounted and are ready for cataloguing and distribution. It is ex- 

 pected that this work will be completed early in the coming year. 



The additions to the Herbarium during the year consist of 4,850 

 sheets and, while not so large numerically as those of the year previous, 

 contain many specimens not formerly represented in the collections. 



Contributions have been received from Messrs. Charles S. William- 

 son, George Hartnell, Dr. John W. Harshberger, Benjamin H. Smith, 

 Samuel S. Van Pelt, E. G. Vanatta, Joseph Crawford, Witmer Stone, 

 the Conservator, and others, with exchanges from the New York 

 Botanical Gardens and the United States Department of Agriculture. 



The Academy's expedition to Fulton County, Pa., in June, added 94 

 sheets of plants from that region; and the exploration of Bermuda, 

 under the joint auspices of the Academy and the New York Botanical 

 Garden, brought back probably the most comprehensive collection of 

 vascular plants ever taken from the islands, consisting of more than 

 400 numbers and 4,000 individual specimens, to be divided between 




928 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



the two institutions. This will make a very valuable addition to the 

 Herbarium, as the flora of that group of islands was previously rep- 

 resented by only a small collection made by Mr. Witmer Stone in 

 1888. 



These plants, now being studied in the Academy's Herbarium, will 

 contribute much to our knowledge of that flora, by adding many species 

 to the already published lists as well as eliminating a number errone- 

 ously recorded through incorrect determinations. 



The Academy has purchased a collection of 100 specimens of Utah 

 plants from Mr. W. A. Garrett, and the Botanical Section a set of Dr. 

 Charles H. Shaw's British Columbia plants, Pringle's Mexican collec- 

 tions for 1903 and 1904 and Heller's California collections for the present 

 year. The greater number of these have been mounted and distrib- 

 uted through the Herbarium. 



The Philadelphia Botanical Club has added to the local Herbarium 

 325 sheets. It has held its meetings in the Herbarium during the year. 

 As a further mark of activity it has just published a book on the 

 local flora entitled Handbook of the Flora of Philadelphia and. Vicinity, 

 which should prove to be particularly valuable to students, and act as 

 a stimulus to the further study of the plants of the region. 



The year has been notable for the number of visitors to the Herbar- 

 ium. The meeting of the American Association for the Advancement 

 of Science, held in Philadelphia during Christmas week, brought to- 

 gether a numlier of the most eminent botanists of the country, many of 

 these paying their first visit to our Herbarium and spending much time 

 there during the session. 



An informal reception, tendered by the Botanical Section and Phila- 

 delphia Botanical Club on the evening of December 29, proved a 

 pleasant occasion, more than fifty of the visiting botanists attending. 



On the afternoon of Deceml^er 31 the Sullivant Moss Chapter held 

 its meeting in the Herbarium, most of its members for the first time 

 having the opportunity of examining the collections of Muhlenberg, 

 Sullivant and others contained in the Herbarium. This occasion 

 brought together many of the most eminent students of the mosses and 

 hepatics. 



During the year many other visiting botanists have availed them- 

 selves of the opportunity for study offered in the Herbarium and 

 Library, and specimens have been loaned for study to Messrs. E. L. 

 Morris, Carlton R. Ball and C. V. Piper. Assistance has been rendered 

 by the Conservator to students and others in determining plants and 

 giving other information.

Treasurer and Conservator, . . Stewardson Brown. 



Respectfully submitted, 



Stew.^rdson Brown, 



Conservator. 



The Ornithological Section. 



During the past year the Conservator has devoted his attention 

 mainly to a rearrangement of the study collection of bird skins which 

 had become overcrowded through the large accessions of the past 

 two years. 



Ten additional moth-proof cases have been procured, which have 

 permitted a thorough rearrangement of most of the Passeres and 

 Picarise, and the necessary relabelling of the trays has been completed. 



A large number of recently acquired specimens, temporarily arranged 

 in wooden cases, have been interpolated in their proper places and 

 catalogued. 



But little progress was made in the transfer of the mounted collec- 

 tion to its new quarters, owing to the fact that the new cases were not 

 completed until the close of the year; but with those now available 

 and others in the course of erection, the transfer of the remaining 

 specimens should be practically completed during the coming year. 



Among the important accessions during the past year are the series 

 of 500 birds from British East Africa deposited l)y Mr. Creorge L. Har- 

 rison, Jr., and the collection of Lower Calif ornian birds obtained by the 

 Rhoads expedition, upon each of which the Conservator has prepared a 

 report for the Academy's Proceedings. 



A large number of the African birds were entirely new to our collec- 

 tion, many of them having been discovered during the past decade. 



Another accession of note was a series of winter birds from South 

 Carolina and of breeding specimens from New Hampshire, received 

 from Mr. Nathan Clifford Brown, the specimens being exquisitely 

 prepared in his well-known manner. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Clu!) has added several speci- 

 mens to its collection of local birds, including a section of tree trunk 

 60

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF

showing the work of the Pileated Woodpecker. The transfer of a part 

 of this collection to the two new cases provided last year adds greatly 

 to its attractiveness as well as to its safety. 



The Club has continued to hold its meetings at the Academy with 

 mutual benefit, and a number of visiting ornithologists have made use of 

 the collections. 



Mr. Paul Lorrilliere has rendered valuable assistance during the year 

 in the care of the collections.
