The Birdsboro Trap Quari'ie-^. — Mr. Theodore I). Rand re- 

 marked that the increasing demand for good road.s has(!aused search 

 to be made for the best material conveniently availal)le. Ncjt long 

 ago Mr. John T. Dyer who has long wrought the extensive lime- 

 stone quarries near Howellville, Chester Co., undertook the quarry- 

 ing of trap rock on Hay Creek, a little over a mile southwe.st of 

 Birdsboro, near Heading, Pa. The trap, proliably a diabase, has 

 come up through the Red Rocks, forming liigh hills on both sides of 

 the creek, the valley of whicii has enabled the Wilmington and 

 Northern R. R. to descend into the Schuylkill Valley. The re- 

 markable feature of this trap is the evidence of inten.^e dynamic ac- 

 tion more recent than the rock itself. There are three quarries, 

 two on the right and one on the left bank of the creek. 



The lower quarries show breasts of about a hundred feet in heiglit, 

 increasing as the quarrying proceeds further into the steep and high 

 hills. Everywhere, except some portions of the upper quarry, the 

 rock is very full of joints, the major striking N. Go° E., the others 

 seemingly in almost every direction, as if the rock had been crushed 

 by a very sudden pressure. The joints show, usually, slickensides 

 on their surfaces, but there is strong cohesion through the joints, 

 but much less than through the rock itself. These joints, of course, 

 greatly facilitate the quarrying and crushing, though ."Sometimes in- 

 terfering with the drilling. At the upper quarry some rock was 

 seen much resembling that of French Creek, and ca[)able, like it, of 

 being quarried in large and regular masses. In this quarry, also, 

 were found some specimens of heulandite and probably lauraontite, 

 giving promise of fine specimens. 



The present output of the quarries is eleven hundred tons of crushed 

 stone per day. The consumption of this large amount shows the 

 remarkable increase in the use of this n)aterial. 



A striking feature was the cleanliness of these quarries. The 

 blasting is done usually twice a day, but after each blast some of 

 the quarrymen are detailed to fork u]) the fragments, so that the 

 horses and carts travel over a smooth and level surface. The horses 

 were of a quality rarely seen in quarry work, and evidently were 

 well cared for and well treated, while thetnen worked industriously, 

 without the vigorous language too often heard in quarrying opera- 

 tions.

THE PLANTS OF LEWIS AND CLARK'S EXPEDITION ACROSS THE CON- 

 TINENT, 1804 1806. 



in' THOMAS MEEIIAN. 



The expedition of Captains Merewether Lewis and William 

 Clark, from what was then the village of St. Lonis, to the sources 

 of the Mississipj)i and across to the Pacific Coast, was one of the 

 marvels in the early history of the American Republic. The inte- 

 rior of the continent was utterly unknown. That it was surely in- 

 habited by wild races of men, and that wild beasts roamed through 

 its trackless forests, comprised almost all that could be told about 

 it. A little band of some half hundred men was detailed to explore 

 these dark corners of our recently acquired territory in face of the 

 fact that they would be lost to home and civilization for several 

 years. Captain Lewis started from Washington to take charge of 

 the party on the 5th of July, 1803. They crossed the continent, 

 reaching the mouth of the Columbia River, and with the loss of but 

 one man, returned and arrived at St. Louis on the 23d of Septem- 

 ber, 1806. To carry a band of men such as he commanded safely 

 through a journey of so many miles, over a period of three years, 

 and in a strange country inhabited by wild people whose habits and 

 character were wholly unknown, and where the subsistence for his 

 men must have been a continual source of anxiety, called for cool- 

 ness, good judgment, and executive ability of no mean order. It is 

 a question whether the services of these great men — Lewis, and his 

 able coadjutor, Clark — have ever been fully appreciated by the 

 country they served. To aid somewhat in doing full justice to the 

 memories of these great explorers has been one of the inducements 

 to prepare the present paper, which it is hoped may also be regarded 

 as a contribution to botanical hi.^tory. 



The idea of ex})loration originated with Jefferson. In 1792 he 

 tried to interest the American Philosophical Society in the plan. 

 It wag approved, and it was decided to jdace the expedition in 

 charge of Andre Michaux. Reasons of State policy arising out of 

 our relation with Michaux's country, caused its abandonment. 

 Lewis was Jefferson's private Secretary, and under him the expedi- 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



tion finally started. Among his other instructions from Jefferson, 

 they were to note the food plants of the Indians and the " dates at 

 which particular plants put forth flowers and leaves." If only they 

 had been authorized to make complete liotanical collections, and a 

 competent collector made part of the expedition, how great a boon 

 would it not have been to botanical science ! From the few they 

 did collect, Pursh in his " Flora Americte Septentrionalis," pub- 

 lished in London in 1814, refers to 119, many of which he de- 

 scribed as wholly new. 



^\'1iat became of the complete collection has never been defi- 

 nitely ascertained up to this time. Pursh says in his preface to the 

 work cited, that after his return from his expedition to the Great 

 Lakes in 1806, Caj)tain Lewis gave him the collection in order to 

 describe and figure those he thought to be new. " The collection 

 was made during the raj)id return from the Pacific. A much more 

 extensive one made on their slow ascent toward the Rocky Mount- 

 ains and the chains of the northern Andes, had unfortunately been 

 lost, by being deposited among other things at the foot of these 

 mountains. The loss of this fine collection is the more to be regret- 

 ted, when I consider that the small collection communicated tome, 

 consisting of al)out loO specimens, contained but about a dozen 

 plants well known to be natives of North America." It was under- 

 stood that Pursh took these plants to England, and tliat they were 

 left l)y him to Mr. A. B. Lambert, Vice-President of the Linnican 

 Society, under whose roof, and by whose aid, Pursh's great work was 

 completed. Lambert's herbarium was finally di.stributed, and, in 

 some way not known to the writer, a number of I>ewis' plants, 

 forming Pursh's types, and marked "from Lambert's Herbarium " 

 became j)art c)f the Herbarium (»f the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. 



Two years ago Profe.«sor C. S. Sargent suggested to the writer 

 the piosibility of some of the material being yet in the custody of 

 the American i'hilosophical Society. The special attention to nat- 

 ural history of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 

 — the leading members of this and the .American Philosophical 

 Society l)eing the san)e — has not warranted the formation of natural 

 history collections by the latter. After long and diligent search, 

 packages of plants were found which could only be these, as tlie 

 localities on the label slips were about the same as those given in 

 Pursh's work. Put the hand-writing was that of a (lernian, and 




14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



occasionally there would l)e a reference to a ^'enus or faniilv of 

 plants exhibiting more botanical knowledge than Captain Lewis or 

 any one in his commanil was known to possess. The plants are 

 in the original packages as presented many years ago. The paper 

 on which the specimens were placed had been in botanical use 

 before. On one of these was written the following expense bill: —

Stage fare 3 00 



Expenses that night 37

May 28, 29, 30. Easton, including breakfast 31, and 



supper 29 4 37 



May 31. Richmonddinner, supper, lodging and drinks 1 00 



It so happened that I had the pleasure of giving to the public in 

 the Gardener's Mcinthly of 1869, what was believed to be Pursh's 

 diary of his trip to the Great Lakes. It commences by saying May 

 26th, '.'prepared myself for the journey," and 27th, "at 4 

 o'clock this morning we left Philadelphia, the stage being remarka- 

 ble full of passengers" — "arrived at 10 o'clock at Easton." On 

 another sheet was found written, as if trying the virtue of a new 

 quill pen, "Frederick Pursh, his hand." There could be no doubt 

 about these being Lewis' plants, and that they had been through 

 Pursh's hands. It was still a mystery how Pursh came to make all 

 the memoranda incident to the collecting of each specimen, on each 

 of these labels. 



With the freedom of three-quarters of a century the museum 

 beetles had made sad work in the bundles. In a few cases the speci- 

 imens had been wholly reduced to dust, and only fragments were left 

 in other cases. Generally, however, they were in fair condition. 

 The Philosophical Society wisely accepted a proposition to deposit 

 these and other collections with the Academy of Natural Sciences, 

 where they would be properly cared for. 



The collection was, as Pursh stated, made for the most part on the 

 return trip. JNIany specimens, as the labels show, were collected 

 and saved between the Rocky Mountains and Fort Clatsop, their 

 winter quarters near theColund)ia River. 



While in doubt as to the authorship of the labels attached to 

 the specimens, note was made of an entry in the minutes of the 

 American Philosophical Society under date of Nov. 15, 1805, that 

 a box of plants was received from Captain Merewether Lewis. The 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



seeds were sent to Mr. William Hamilton, and the " Hortns Siccus 

 referred to Dr. Burton to examine and report." A full examina- 

 tion of the collection, revealed this package also. It contained the 

 plants collected in 1804 hetween St. Louis and Fort ^landan. 

 Pursh had evidently been over this, as in many instances the labels 

 were similar to those in the other package ; but a number had the 

 original memoranda in the hand-writing of Captain Lewis. These 

 were written wholly across the sheet containing the specimens. 

 Pursh had evidently copied them in order to have small compact 

 labels for the specimens, and while doing so, had occasionally added 

 the more technical botatiical points already adverted to. He 

 evidently studied the.'^e collections before starting to Europe with 

 them, leaving the duplicates, where there were any, and those which 

 were too imperfect to be easily recognized. A comparison of 

 Lewis's own labels and Pursh's copies shows that the latter were 

 not always strictly copied — differences can be seen in the compari- 

 sons made in the Catalogue. Pursh's notes were probably made 

 from Lewis's original memoranda carried away with the speci- 

 mens, and are, therefore the more likely to be the exact statements 

 of the collectors, than the copies left with these. 



After determining the plants in the collection as far as I could, 

 considering the fragmentary conditi<jn of many of them, I handed 

 them over for correction to Dr. B. L. Robinson of the Gray 

 Herbarium. With their return, I received the following letter. 



"The identification of the Lewis and Clark plants has now been 

 completed and I am happy to be able to send you a list, as Mr. 

 (Jreenman and I understand them. We have worked over the 

 plants together for greater accuracy, discussing almost every 

 specirm-n. In any reference to work done here upon the plants, 

 kindly associate the name of Mr. (Ireenman with my own. The 

 plan of the list is to show in double columns : — 1st, what the plant 

 actually is, according to |)resent ideas of classification, then the 

 actual locality and <late which the acc<jmf)aiiyiiig laltcl bears; 

 2iid, ill the other column, is shown wiiat I'lirsb a|ipcars to iiave 

 called tlu; plant in his Flora, provided lie mentioned it clearly ; also 

 the locality ami date which he there a^criiied to it. I lliiiik that 

 the advantage of this parallel column presentation of this impor- 

 tant collection will be readily evident to you. 



Perha{)S the most interesting find in the collection is the unlabellcd 

 C'lematiK. Now as this is the only Clematln re])re8ented, and the only 




16 PROCEEDINOS OF THK ACADKMY OF [1898. 



one mentioned l)y Pnrsh as liavinj; been collected l)y Lewis and Clark 

 was his ( '. hirsiitissima, there is every reason to believe that this is 

 the real type (or portion of type) of (\ hirsutvisima Pnrsh. lint 

 the specimen is certainly ('. Douglasii Hook., a later sjjecies, and 

 wol Anemone patens, as it has been traditionally interpreted. On 

 readintr the description of ('. hirsutis.fiina in Pursh's Flora if. is 

 impossible to doubt that it refers to ('. Douglasii with its 4 sepals, 

 not Anemone patens with its 5 to 8 sepals. This fact was, I think, 

 guessed by Mr. Coville, some years ago, but I fail to find any pub- 

 lication of it. Certaiidy Prof. Biitton in his Flora does not challenge 

 the identity of Anemone paten>>, var. Nuttalliana with Clematis hir- 

 sutissima, lor he still keeps up his Anemone hlrsutii^sima (Pursb) 

 Britton. 



It seems only right that C. Douglasii Hook, should give place to 

 the older and well described (although long misunderstood) ('. hir- 

 sutissima Pursh. This is certainly iin interesting point. Perhaps 

 before publishing it, it might be courteous to Mr. Coville to inquire 

 whether he had already published or had in press anything on the 

 subject, which is unlikely. Some reference also might be made 

 to tlie fact that he had' independently and without a knowledge of 

 Lewis's type discovered from the description the probable identity 

 of C. hirsutissima Pursh. 



In the list, Anemone qninqaefolia is used to mean all N. American 

 "A. nemorosa," not in the sense in which Pursh understood it, 

 namely as covering only the quinquefoliolate form. 



The type of Cleome serralata Pursh (at least one of the specimens) 

 shows slight serrulation of the leaves, so that the name ouglit not to 

 give place to the later 0. integrifolia Torr. & Gray, although the 

 latter is, in general, more appropriate, or would be if the authors had 

 only written integrijolioluta. 



The specimen of Lewisia triphylla ((Jlaytonia triphylla Wats.) ex- 

 tends the known range of the species to Idaho, 



Pursh's Oxi/troj)is argentnta is evidently larger than 0. nana Nutt. 

 to which it has traditionally been referred, and also has longer, more 

 slender calyx lobes. Perhaps these are only varietal differences. 

 Their value can be told only by some one with a monographic 

 knowledge of the genus. 



Strangely enough Pursh's Pedicularis elata looks exceedingly like 

 P. scopulorum Gray from a very different range. It is certainly 

 not P. bracfeosa Benth. to which it is traditionally referred. 






1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



There are two species of Festiica upon which we cannot give any 

 definite opinion ; might they not be referred to Prof. Scribner at 

 Washington ? 



Tiie alga (Egregia Mevziesii) was identified by Dr. Farlow. 



Various other points will be apparent to you from the lisft. Pos- 

 sibly you will be able to identify still more of the plants (as now 

 named) with the descriptions of Pursh's Flora. 



I wish once more to express my gratitude to you for the great 

 privilege of examining this remarkably valuable and interesting 

 collection. The plants, carefully packed, are to day returned." 



The work by Messrs Robinson and (Jreenman is so carefully and 

 thoroughly done, that I have used their manuscript. I have added 

 by way of notes, such matters as may not have been covered by the 

 work of these good friends.

Pursh describes Allium angttlosum I, p. 223, as '■ on the banks of the Mis- 

 souri, M. Lewis, July." The specimen in this collection is so eaten that 

 neither flowers nor roots are left. As these remains are ticketed " on the 

 waters of the Kooskooskee, April 30, 1806," it is probably of another species 

 overlooked by Pursh, and not am^ulosum. So far as the leaves indicate, it 

 may be A. rcticulatunt. 



** Described by Purf^h as BroJiaa grandiflora Fl. I, p 223. " Hyacinth of

 plant was called by M. Lewis rightly, Mi-ssouri Hyacinth." In the Journal oi

To the above detail by Dr. Robinson and ISIr. Greennian, it 

 may now be noted that this collection contains specimens of 

 all but sixteen of Lewis's plants as desciibed by Pursh in his 

 Flora. Of these sixteen, seven, as marked with an asterisk, are 

 represented already in the specimens from Lambert's herbarium, 

 leaving but nine of the plants missing from the collection as described 

 by Pursh. Only a few of these nine missing ones are of material 

 importance. For all practical purposes, all the plants of Lewis 

 and Clark's expedition are now deposited in the Academy. 



* Berberis Aquifolium Pursh. 

 *Berberis nervosa I'm-fb. 

 "Ceanothus sanguineus I'lin^h. 



Under the provisional name of " C. atropurpureus." 

 *P8oralea esculenta I'ur.-h. 



In the Journal of the expedition, under date of August 10th, it 

 is noted " at the confluence of the Yellowstone with the Missouri, 

 Captain Clark found to day * * the men also dug up large 

 quantities of a large and very insii)id root called by the Indians 

 Hankee, and by the ' engages ' ' white apple.' It is used by them 

 in a dry and powdered state, but our men boiled it and ate it with 

 their meat." 



On the same sheet with Psoralea esculenta Pursh has fastened down 

 a specimen of P. hi/pogoea Nutt, not noting its distinction. The ini- 

 tials of Professor Britton are under it with this correction : It was 

 evidently collected on the headwaters of the Platte, where Nuttall 

 subsequently found it.

NEW AND LITTLE KNOWN BEES FROM WASHINGTON STATE. 



BY T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



Halictus pacificus n. »\>. 



9 . — Length 10 mm., black, with ochreous pubescence, inclining 

 to fulvous in very fresh examples, whitish in very faded ones; 

 second, third and fourth segments of alxionion with Interrupted basal 

 bands, ochreous in color, of dense oppressed hair, broad laterally, 

 tapering to a point mesad ; in very worn examples these bands are 

 practically obliterated. Head ordinary, cheeks unarmed, antennae 

 wholly dark, tegulse reddish-piceous ; wings with more or less of a 

 yellowish tint, faintly dusky toward the apex ; subcostal nervure 

 black, other nervures, and stigma, honey color ; enclosure of meta- 

 thorax semilunar, strongly radiately wrinkled, bounded by a tolerably 

 distinct rim; legs black, small joints of tarsi ferruginous; abdomen 

 with numerous very minute punctures, hair bands interrupted, apex 

 with pale fuscous hair. 



S . — Differs in the usual manner from the 9 . Apical portion of 

 clypeus yellow. Antennae long, flagellum, except the last two joints, 

 ferruginous beneath. Pubescence paler ; nervures darker ; anterior 

 tibiae in front, middle tibiae at apex, hind tibiae at both ends, and all 

 the tarsi, yellow, 



Hab. — Olympia, Wash., March 23 to July 9, numerous speci- 

 mens. (T. Kincaid). Also taken by Mr. Kincaid at Seattle, May 

 14th, on Rub us ursi7iu^. 



The following tal)le separates the females of various large Halicti 

 allied to pacificus: 



A. Enclosure of metathorax granular. 



a. Large, with a broad face lerouxii Lep. 



b. Smaller, with a narrower face coriacev^ Sm. 



B. Enclosure of metliathorax plicate. 



a. Wings clear, stigma piceous, tegulae testaceous, sisymbrii Ckll. 



b. Wings yellowish, stigma honey-color, rather larger species . 



pacificus Ckll. 

 The above four were all taken at Olympia. Three other species 

 are allied to coriaceus : 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



1. H. hardus Cr., known by the clear wings and fuscous nervures. 



2. H. poUtns Sm., from Mexico, with the face broader above, 

 wings strongly yellowish. 



3. H. forbesii Rob., having the clypeus less produced. 1 have 

 examined a great number of eoriaceus from Wash., and various 

 specimens from New Mexico and Illinoi?, considered to heforbesii; 

 also an Illinois coriacens from Mr. Robertson. The result of this 

 study is that I believe all belong to one somewhat variable species. 

 The characters given by Robertson to separate the females seem not 

 to be constant, but I have not been able to compare the males. It 

 is to be remarked, however, that Robertson's description of the 

 metatlioracic enclosure of forbesii, " bearing irregular radiating 

 rugie, which reach the posterior margin," will hardly apply to what 

 I have (Tr. Am. Ent. Soc, 1897, p. 163) regarded as that species, 

 80 it may be that the real forbesii is a valid species near pacificiis, 

 which I have not seen. In that case it will be separated from paci- 

 ficus by the continuous abdominal bands, which are whitish instead 

 of ochraceous. 



The following table separates some males which are more or less 

 similar to pacijicu.-< : 



A. Clypeus wholly dark sisymbrii. 



B. Clypeu.s partly yellow. 



n. Legs all dark, size small angustior. 



b. Legs partly yellow. 



i. Hind tibia- black except ends, enclosure of metathorax 



plicate jxicijictis. 



a. Hind tibiic yellow with only a suffused dark jjatch, 



</. .Size large, (lagellum all dark, enclosure of metathorax 



irregularly wrinkled lerouxii. 



b. Hize smaller, fliigclhim ferruginous beneath. 



1. Size larger, head and thorax black .... ligatus. 



2. Size smaller, head and thorax greenish . . /(wciaiua. 

 Colletes pascoeniifl r. "i

 pubescence having only a fiiint yellow or dchreous lingc. Face and 

 thorax densely covered with long ha\r, r /iee/iJ< uil/i black- hair, vertex 

 shining but well punctured ; clypeus shining, with large close sub- 

 lanceolate punctures; diftaure between eye and boxe of inaudible

iriL', with large well-separated punctures ; postscutelluni rough iuul 

 dull ; hiise of inetathorax jiittrd, shiuiiijr, lateral faces tolerably 

 shiny; teiruhe piceoiis ; wings dull hyaline, noticeably pid)escent, 

 nervures and stigma piceous ; stigma small, marginal cell appendi- 

 culate; legs black, first two joints of hind tarsus rather broad; 

 pubescence of femora yellowish-white, oj tibuK black, of tarsi black 

 without and pale reddish-brown within ; abdomen shining, strovyly 

 but not very close /ji punctured, the hind-margins of the segments with 

 rather thin yellowish-white hair-bands, the surface of the first two 

 segments with long erect thin yellowish-white pubescence, that of 

 the remninimj ntgmenU with shorter black pubescence. 



9 • — Much like that of ai'mata in general appearance, but the 

 pubescence of the head, pleura atid legs is entirely black, contrasting 

 with that of the thoracic dorsum, which is yellowish-white, not at all 

 mixed with black. The abdomen has no bands, but is thinly clothed 

 with rather short and it)Conspicuous hair, yellowish-white on the 

 first segment, black on all the rest. The first segment has its lateral 

 hind margins narrowly fringed with short dense white hair; the 

 punctures on the second segment are of two sizes, large and small. 

 Antennte dark, the flagellum with only the faintest chocolate tinge 

 beneath, first joint of flagellum not quite as long as the second and 

 tiiird together. The second recurrent nervure is less bent than 

 usual in the genus. 



//a6.— Pasco, Wash., 8 9 , 4 <? , May 25, 1896 (T. Kincaid). The 

 females might be mistaken for some Andrena allied to vicina. C. 

 pascoensis approaches nearest to the descriptions of C. californica and 

 C. consors. From consors Cress., it differs in the pallid pubescence 

 and the black hair as described; this relates to the S , the 9 of 

 consors being unknown. From californica Prov., it differs by the 

 entirely black hair of the head and legs in the 9 . It may be added, 

 that pascoensis is also decidedly larger than consors or californica. 

 CoUetes kincaidii n. sp. 



9 • — Length aboutl3 mm., black, with clear fulvous pubescence on 

 head and thorax, tolerably dense, nowhere mixed with black, becom- 

 ing whitish on the ventral surface. Head rather broad, vertex with 

 irregularly-placed punctures of various sizes, clypeus with the 

 punctures running into strise, labrum with conspicuous grooves 

 alternating with ridges, mandibles dark, space between eye and 

 base of mandible broader than long, antennjo very .'■hort, wholly 

 black ; prothoracic spire short, hidden by the pubescence ; meso-

thorax with very large and close punctures, except a large area in 

 the middle, which is shining and iinj)unctate ; scutellum with large 

 punctures, except the anterior border, wliich is impunctate ; post- 

 scutelluni roughened ; hasal enclosure of nietathorax bounded by a 

 distinct rim, shining, with about sixteen strong ridges ; lateral faces 

 dullish, the triangle shining; tegulse dark brown; wings hyaline, 

 nervures and stigma black, stigma small, marginal cell appendicu- 

 late, second recurrent nervure considerably bent; second subynar- 

 ginal cell extremely broad, larger than the third ; legs black, with 

 yellowish-white, almost silvery, pubescence ; pubescence on inner 

 side of hind tarsi yellowish-white, except that the first-three joints 

 are tipped ivith Khining orange fnlrous ; abdomen lanceolate, shining ; 

 first two segments very strongly pxinctared, the punctures on the second 

 smaller and closer than on the first; reviaining segmenti with minute 

 inconspicuous puncture-'^, and a more sericeous surface ; hind margins 

 of the segments with broad appre-ised uhite hair-bands, all very con- 

 spicuous, that on the first more or less interrui)ted in the middle; 

 some inconspicuous short black hair on the dorsum of the third to 

 fifth segments, and on the apex. 



i . — lOi mm. long. Similar to the 9 . but more slender. Face 

 much n)ore narrowed below; anteniue long, wholly black; space 

 between eye and base of mandii)le .somewhat larger, but still broader 

 than long ; thoracic pubescence rather more highly colored ; hair- 

 band on first abd<Mninal segment entire. 



Hab. — Olympia, Wash., July 5, 1896, at flowers of Potoitilln 

 palujilris ; also June 30th, at flowers of lupine. A large and hand- 

 some species, but closely similar to several others. 



C. inccqualis liiffers at once in the 9 , but the S is fpiitc like our 

 insect, being however larger, with a longer stigma, aiid the faceless 

 narrowed below. 



C simulatis (known only in the ^ ) is smalltr than linraidii, and 

 ha'^ the al)dom<'n unif'>rinily punctured. 



C gilen.-i-< has l)lack hair on the thoracic dorsnu). ('. comjtactn 

 lias fjuile a different melathorax. C. (cstivalis differs by the biown 

 8tii,'nia, the much narrower second submarginal cell, the more 

 parallel orbit.^, the much smaller punctures of the mcsothorax, the 

 very dark toguhc the htronger punctuation of the third abdominal 

 segment, and the pale fulvous hair on the aj)ical segment. The 

 fcstivalis compared is an Illinois example fr. m Mr. Robertson. 




64 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



I am surprised to find, on reexamining tlie specimens, that the 

 species found by Prof. Wooton on Ruidoso Creek in New Mexico, 

 and recorded by me (An. Map. Nat. Hist., Jan., 1897, p. 49) as 

 astivalis, is m reality C. kincaidli. 

 Habropoda floridana (Siuilh) var. n. pascoensis. 



9 . — Length about 16 mm., diHers from Smith's description in that 

 the pubescence of the head is pale, mixed, however with black on 

 the face and vertex, the wings are little darkened, and the pul)es- 

 cence at the sides of the end of the ai)domen is .shining white. The 

 pubescence of the thorax and of the first abdominal segment is very 

 bright orange fulvous, not at all mixed with black. The short 

 pubescence immediately surrounding the pygidial plate is black. 

 Tegulic black. Pubescence of legs black ; that on inner side of 

 front tarsi orange-rufous, the i>rushes at the ends of the segments 

 tipped with brilliant coppery-red. Hair on lower part of [ileura 

 black. 



//ai.— Pasco, Wash., May 25, 1896, (T. Kincaid). It is just pos- 

 sible that this is the unknown 9 of H. morrisoni Cresson. It has a 

 superficial resemblance to Fodalirius ursinus. 

 Podalirius crotchii (CiessDu). 



J _Proni Pasco, Wash., May 25, 1896 (T. Kincaid) agrees with 

 Cresson's description. Hitherto the species has only been reported 

 from California. The pubescence on the hind tarsi within is brilliant 

 fulvous. 

 Podalirius syringae n. sji. 



S . — Length about 12 mm., black, pubescence long and erect, not 

 very dense, mouse-color; strongly mixed with black on hind two- 

 thirds of raesothorax, and anterior margin of scutellum ; black also 

 on vertex and upper part of cheeks, mi.xed with black on front and 

 more or less on sides of face ; pubescence of abdomen long, thin and 

 pale at ba.se of first and sides of first-three segments, dorsally from 

 the third segment onward scanty and black, some pale hairs at the 

 extreme apex ; no hair-bands. Clypeus except the black anterior 

 edge, a supraclypeal band, irregularly v shaped lateral marks, and 

 labrum except the anterior margin and upper lateral corners, all 

 lemon-yellow. Mandibles and the quite long antennae wholly black. 

 Mesothorax dull, with numerous shallow j>unctures, two small im- 

 punctate central areas. Metathorax shining. Legs slender, ante- 

 rior and middle trochanters, and upper half of anterior femora be- 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



hind, with shining white hair ; otherwise the pubescence of the 

 femora, as of the tibiae, is black. Tarsi with partly black and partly 

 pale hair, that on the inner side of the first four tarsi shininj; ferru- 

 ginous; small joints of tarsi a lively ferruginous. Tegula^ black or 

 piceous. Wings dusky hyaline. Apex of abdomen bideutate. 



Hab. — Olynipia, Wash., July 8rd, at flowers of Syi-iuga ; also 

 June 27th, (T. Kiiicaid). Nearest to P. simillhnii.'i (Cress.), but 

 differs by the wholly black scape and the distribution of the pubes- 

 cence. 

 Megachile calogaster n. ?]>. 



i. — Length ll-12i mm., stoutly built, black, with pubescence 

 varying fnjm pale ochraceousto whitish, not dense enough on thorax 

 to conceal the surface, some short black hair on cheeks just behind 

 eyes, and a good deal on the middle of the mesothorax. Head 

 ordinary ; a conftpicuous patch of white hair on lower part of cheek ; 

 face quite densely clothed with yellowish-white hair ; vertex strongly 

 punctured, as also the clypeus ; antennie wholly dark, last joint oval 

 and flattened ; mandibles black, elbowed without, tridentate ; thorax 

 strongly and closely punctured ; anterior coxce irith a large rather 

 broad and blunt spire, above whicJi is a transverse patch of the most 

 brilliant orange-rufons pubescence; anterior femora stout, sub- 

 trigonal, ferruginous with a black patch at base and apex within, 

 the latter connecting with a broad black external stripe extending 

 the whole length of the femur; under side of anterior femur with 

 long snow-white pubescence; anterior tibia short and thick, black 

 without, mostly ferruginous within, a large aj)ical triangular patch 

 without pale yellow, apex with a blunt pale yellowish tooth extend- 

 ing at right angles to the axis; anterior tarsi pale yellow, tinged with 

 ferruginous tou-ard the end; first joint hollowed, produced at the end, 

 but not extending aj< far as tip of second joint ; second and third 

 joints broadened, and elongated at one side; anterior tarsi behind 

 fringed with long white hair; middle and hind legs entirely black, 

 their femora and libite with scanty whitish pubescence, jiartly black 

 on hind legs, their tarsi with shining orange fulvous hair; claws 

 with the basal half ferruginous, the apical half black ; teguhr bhick, 

 punctured; wings tinged with fuliginous, nervures black, marginal 

 cell (juite long and narrow ; abilamrn short and convex, without any 

 hair bands, but having rather long thin pubescence, nowhere con- 

 cealing the surface, grayish-white or pale ochreous on the fir>t two

segments, nearly all black on the rest ; apex with a hroad semicir- 

 cular emargination ; three large suhapical ventral teeth. 



9 . — About 14 mm. long; similar to the $ , except in the usual 

 sexual characters. Legs black, ivitli black jmhescence ; that on the 

 inner side of the front and hind tarsi, and both sides of the middle 

 tarsi, lively ferruginous ; pubescence of ciieeks all black; ventral 

 scopa dense, black only to a slight extent at base, otherwise very bril- 

 liant orange fulvous. 



Hah. — Olympia, Wash., June 30th, at flowers of lupine; also 

 June 19th to July 4th (T. Kincaid). A distinct and handsome 

 species. 

 Sphecodes kinoaidii n. sp. 



9 . — Length 12 mm., the abdomen qnite elongated tcith approxiin- 

 alely parallel sides. Head and thorax black, abdomen entirely bright 

 ferruginous ; head transversely oval, front dull and very coarsely 

 rugose, clypeus subcancellate with strong punctures; pubescence of 

 face dirty whitish; antennae, wholly dark; first joint of flagellum 

 very short, broader than long; mandibles dark, only rufescent at 

 the extreme tip, inner tooth short and blunt ; labrum not emargin- 

 ate; mesothorax nearly bare, shining, with large strong punctures ; 

 base of metathorax coarsely cancellate, enclosed by a rim ; tegulse 

 brown ; wings rather pale fulginou-, nervures and stigma jjiceous, 

 stigma considerably larger than hi S. dichrous, first recurrent nervure 

 joining second submarginal cell before its end ; legs black, hind tarsi 

 entirely ferruginous ; abdomen smooth and shining, loilh small sparse 

 punctures, first two segments appearing nearly in)punctate, with a 

 very few large punctures and more numerous very minute ones. 

 The third segment is much more punctate than the second. Apex 

 with some dark hair. 



Hab.—0\ym\n2L, Wash., June 19, 1895 (T. Kincaid). Easily 

 known by the large size, and the narrow elongate sparsely punctured 

 abdomen. It is not likely, I think, that it is the unknown 9 of 

 S. davisii Rob. S. dichrous Sm., also occurs at Olympia.

THE GEKRHONOTUS OF THE SAN LUCAN FAUNA, LOWEE CALIFORNIA, 

 WITH DIAGNOSIS OF OTHER WEST AMERICAN SPECIES. 



BY JOHN VAN DENBURGH. 



A little more than two years ago, in a consideration of the rep- 

 tiles of Lower California,' I said that " Without larger series of the 

 other species than are at hand, the status of the Gerrhonoti from the 

 'Cape Region ' of Lower California cannot be satisfactorily deter- 

 mined. It seems probable, however, that they are distinct from the 

 more northern G. scincicauda, and are referable to the name G. 

 multicarrttatas Blainv." More recently' I have been able to ex- 

 amine large numbers of specimens of the four species of this genus 

 which are known to occur in California, Oregon and Wasliington, 

 and to discover more or less definite limits to their variation. I 

 wish now to consider the status of the Lower Californian form.' 



At first glance the lower Californian lizard bears a resemblance 

 to GerrJt07iof>is prindpis of the I*uget Fauna. This, however, is 

 merely a superficial resemblance due to the comparative smoothness 

 ofthe.se two forms, and in a less degree to their similar size and the 

 occasional absence of complete dorsal color bands in the San Lucan 

 species. In the number of the longitudinal rows of its dorsal scales 

 this Gerrhoiiotiis is .similar to G. palmeri and G. burnettii. In 

 other characters, however, it approaches Gerrhonofus scincicmida, 

 to which I believe it is mo.«t closely related. 



The following table shows the variation in the .several species of 

 tho.se characters which seem to be of value in classification. The 

 figures indicate the numl)er of specimens examined. 



From this table we may formulate a key which will .serve to 

 identify most specimens :

ANATOMICAL NOTES ON CERTAIN WEST AMERICAN HELICES. 

 by h. a. pil.sbry and e. g. vanatta." 



The genus Glyptostoma. 



This genus has very distinct concliological features, the shell re- 

 calling the typical Zonitea in form. The jaw, raduia and genitalia 

 have been investigated and figured by W. G. Binney. From 

 these data the senior writer placed CUyjAostoma in the group Belo- 

 gona Euadenia of the arrangement of Helices given in volume IX of 

 the M'innal of Coiichology, near the genus Epiphragmophora. We 

 have now examined two .specimens of G. Nexvhernianum. The genital 

 system of one is figured on PI. I, fig. 1. The two examples dis- 

 sected agree perfectly in all details, but in several points do not 

 correspond with Binney's figures. The right eye is retracted be- 

 tween i and 9 branches of tiie genitalia. The penis is continued a 

 short distance beyond the insertion of the vas deferens, and may be 

 regarded as having a rudimentary epipliallus, tlie long retractor 

 inserted thereon distally. There is no trace of a flagellum. Vagina 

 long, at its apex the very long duct of the spermatheca enters. Tliis 

 duct is of the length of the uterus and terminates in a large globular 

 spermatheca. No diverticulum. At the point where the s|). d. 

 euter."^, an ovate sessile body is placed. This has tlie shining, fleshy 

 niu.scidar substance commonly seen in dart sacks ; and we do not 

 doubt that the organ is of that nature, although no dart was found in 

 either of the two individuals dissected. The lumen presented 

 several broad folds, and no di.-tinct apical papilla. There is no trace 

 of mucus glands. The talon is unusually long. 



From these characters it ap[)ears tiiat the genus, while probably 

 belonging with the series of American dart lii-aring Helices, is 

 extreniely isolated. The other .American genera. Epiphragmoph-

ora, Lysinoe, Leptarionta, CepoUs, and Pohjmiia arc all more nearly 

 allied to each other than to G/i/ittostoma.'' 



The hick of mucus glands is a degenerative feature unique in Be- 

 logona Euadenia, though it occurs in the Belogona Slphonadenia. 



The high insertion of the dart sack is very unusual. 



The talon is longer than in any other lleliv known to vis. 



The loss of a flagelluin on the penis is unique among Araerican 

 Euadenke, but occurs in certain Chinese forms of Enlota and in 

 many other Old World groups. It is not usually a character of 

 generic iinjiortance in Helices. 



The Micrarionta group of Epiphragmophora. 



Micrarionta was proposed by Mr. C. F*. Ancey as a subgenus of 

 Helix, based mainly, it would seem, upon the small size of the shell 

 and reflexed lip of its type, H. facta. In the "(iuide to the Study 

 of Helices" the group was expanded to include the larger, simple- 

 lipped Lower Californian Helices which Binney (following von 

 Martens) referred to Kuparypha; and it was shown to have well 

 marked anatomical features unlike any other known group of 

 Helices. 



The three subgeneric groups into which our AVest Coast Epiphr- 

 agmophoras were divided in the " Guide," — Micrarionta, Helmintho- 

 glypta and Monadenia, — differ trenchantly in the forms of their 

 mucus glands. In the first they are inserted by two separate ducts 

 at the base of, rather than upon, the dart sack. In the second a 

 single duct enters the dart sack, and splits into two bulbiferous 

 branches above. In the third there is a single club-shaped gland. 

 The other characters of the soft anatomy, as well as the shells, are 

 not very unlike in the three groups. 



Of the eleven species oi Micrarionta, E. intercisa and E. levis are 

 unknown anatomically. E. Gahbi,rvficincta, intercisa, Kelletiidindi 

 Tryoni are known to us by W. G. Binney's figures, but several char* 

 acters being unnoticed by Binney, a reexamination of these is desir- 

 able. We have dissected 7t,'. «?'eo/a<«, /''a?)tZorcR, Veitchii, Stearns iatia 

 and Guadaiupiana. 



E. Guadaiupiana Dall, PI. I, fig. 11 (genitalia) differs consider- 

 ably from the other species examined. The flagellum is but little 



* Leptarionfa is hardly sufficiently known to be included in this statement. 

 It should be slated tliat the shell characters of Glyptonloma are also notably 

 different from any of the other genera named.

longer than the penis and epiphullus taken together. The sperma- 

 theca duct bears no diverticulum. The dart sack ii derjaierate, 

 reduced to a small wide bud, one mucus gland arising at its right 

 side, descending, club shaped, the other at left side, ascending and 

 slightly sacculated ; both entirely free, not bound to the vagina. The 

 right eye-retractor passes to the left of the genital system, not between 

 its branches. 



The last characters may be expected to occur in E. facta and 

 ruficincta. It i> a very unusual feature. The suhobsolete coiKJition 

 of tlie dart sack is unlike any allied species. The measurements 

 are: length of penis+epiphallus 9 mm.; of flagellum 10; of sper- 

 matheca duct 15 mm. 



The other forms examined have the flagellum very long, dart sack 

 well developed, one of the mucus glands descending, spread upon 

 the base of vagina, the other upon the dart sack, both bound down. 

 Diverticulum developed and long except in Stearnsiana. In all, the 

 spermatheca arises high, near the distal end of the vagina. The 

 dimensions of the parts are as follows: 



Pandorce. Veitchii. Areolata. Stearnsiana. 

 Length of penis -|-epiphallus 15 35 28 22 28 mm. 



Length of flagellum 21 67 50 26 27 mm. 



Length of s[)ermatheca duct 17* 54 49 43 35 mm. 



Length of diverticulum 13 43 25 1 mm. 



Thrown into the form (if an analytical key, the genital characters 

 give these results : 

 a. Right eye retractor passing between <? and 9 branches of geni- 

 talia; diverticulum presents one mucus gland spread upon and 

 firndy bound to vagina behjw dart sack. 

 Ii. Flagellum and spermatheca duct of about equal length,

 length as f)eiii<»-f ef)iphallus. 

 b. Dart sack degenerate, very .sninll Ovadalupiayia. 




70 PROCEEDINGS OF THK ACADEMY OF [1898. 



No further details of the genitalia are needed except such as are 

 clearly shown in the figures; and of course some variation in the 

 absolute dimensions of various organs is to be expected. 



Details are lacking to intercalate the other species of the sub- 

 genus in the above synopsis, but from Biuney's figures it seems that 

 E. Kelh'fti and Tri/oni fall into § bh. of the first division (a.) of this 

 dichotonious table, and it is likely that E. rvjicincta and facta group 

 in the second division, aa. They differ from E. Guadaliqnana Dall 

 in having the dart sack well developed. The position (jf the eye 

 retractor muscle is unknown. Neither of them has a diverticulum 

 on the spermatheca duct. 



E.Stearnsiiina differs considerably from areolata, Pandoroe, Veitchii 

 and, according to Binney's ^g\\Yes,KelleUi,m having the diverticulum 

 short or obsolete. Two specimens were dissected, both from Coro- 

 nado Islands. In one (66,091 A. N. S. P. Mus., coll. by A. W. 

 Anthony) there is no trace of a diverticulum. In the other (69,014, 

 from Prof. W. H. Dall) there is a very short diverticulum, about 

 1 mm. long, arising slighily beyond the lower fourth of the length 

 of spermatheca duct. In this specimen the duct is 8 mm. shorter 

 than in the other. Binney's figure shows a somewhat longer diver- 

 ticulum than our No. 69,014, but it is still very short. This variation 

 in the diverticulum is exactly paralleled in the European Helix 

 pomatia.

The author lias withheld the publication of the present paper for 

 some time in the hope that an opportunity would present itself for 

 the classification of the true Mutillidie in the collection of Mr. H. H. 

 Smith, and thereby avoid the inconvenience of listing the Mutillidae 

 in more than one paper. Circumstances, however, will not permit 

 the carrying out of such a plan, so he feels obliged to present this 

 paper for publication, even though it deals with but a part of one

The description of this species as given by Klug will fit what I 

 have determined as Smith's Elaphroplera carbonaria, as will also 

 King's description of Thynnus anthracimis. The specimen I refer 

 to aethiops is larger and heavier than carbonarius, and is more 

 coarsely punctured. It is probable that carbonarius is the same as 

 anthracinus, but the descriptions of both are so poor that nothing 

 conclusive can be determined from them, except their faultiness.

THE SUMMER BIRDS OF SUSQUEHANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. 

 BY FKANCIS K. COPE, JR.' 



Since the publication of Dr. Dvvight's paper on the "Siiramei 

 Bird.s of the Crest of the Pennsylvania Alleghenies," (Auk, JX, 

 April, 1892), and ]\Ir. Stone's on the " Summer Birds of Harvey's 

 Lake, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania," (Proc Acad. Nat. Sci. 

 Phila., 1891, pp. 431-438)^ no detailed account has appeared of the 

 summer birds of the northeastern part of the State, although it has 

 generally been suppot^ed that the fauna of this region partook 

 largely of the nature of the North INIountain district, with perhaps 

 a slightly stronger tinge of the Canadian element. Indeed, on the 

 faunal map attached to Mr. Stone's volume on the " Birds of 

 eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey"^ almost the whole of Sus- 

 quehanna County is included in what is known as the Canadian 

 fauna. 



The present paper, based on several years study of the birds of 

 the county, and including only such species as have been observed 

 during the breeding season, siiy from June 15th to the second week 

 in July, shows, I think, that the fauna of Susquehanna County, al- 

 though it has a strong tinge of this Canadian element, possesses it 

 to a less marked degree than the mountainous region further south. 

 This fact may doubtless be accounted for by the absence of any very 

 extensive hemlock forests, such as those found around Harvey's 

 Lake and on North Mountain. 



Reference to a map will ^how that Su.squehanna County is sit- 

 uated in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania, between latitude 

 41° 40' and 42°. It is part of the Allegheny and Pocono plateaux^ 

 and may be described as a hilly, rocky country, interspersed with 

 innumerable small valleys. With the exception of many small

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

 subject, entitled " Summer Birds of northern Elk County, Pennsylvania," by 

 ^Villiam L. Baily. {Auk, XIII, October, 1896).

lakes and ponds, tlie land is poorly watered, there heino; but few 

 streams of any size. A spur of the Aliet^henies extends through 

 the southeastern corner, terminating in Elk Mountain, which last 

 rises to an altitude of about 3,000 feet and is almost the only emi- 

 nence in the county worthy of the name of mountain, the other hills 

 not rising much above 2,000 feet. Tlie vast tracts of forest, which 

 fifty years ago covered the greater part of the county, now every- 

 where bear witness to the ravages of axe and fire, and are broken 

 up into isolated patches. Among the principal forest trees may be 

 mentioned the Beech, Maple, Hemlock, Chestnut, Birch, and Pine, 

 the last mentioned being, perhaps, the least j)lentiful of the six. Of 

 these species the Hemlock has doubtless suffered the most, being 

 [)articularly prized for its bark ; nevertheless it is still found in con- 

 siderable numbers inters[)erse<l an)ong the other trees. 



It is in these small, but numerous tracts of primeval forest which 

 yet remain uncut, that we find most of the truly Canadian species. 

 Here such northern birds as Black-throated, Blue, Canadian, Mag- 

 nolia and Blackburnian Warblers, Water Thrushes, Solitary Yireos 

 and Hermit Thrushes are all more or less common, some Ijeing aljun- 

 <lanl, but they are almost entirely confined to the deep woods, espe- 

 cially where there is a thick growth of hemlock. Of other Cana- 

 dian species, the Jutico seems to be generally confined to the open 

 clearings and pastures bordering on woodland, and is decidedly 

 rare. Elk Mountain being the only locality where it has been found 

 breeding in any numbers. Even here, however, where during the 

 latter part of June, 1894, I found upward of a dozen pairs breed- 

 ing at an altitude of 2,600 feet, not a single bird was observed on a 

 second visit, .July 2, 1897. Winter Wrens are conspicuous by their 

 absence, although there seems to be no good reason why this spe- 

 cies should tiot occur plentifully, unless it be owing to the ab.sence 

 of any very extensive hemlock forests, as l)efore renuirked. My 

 only reason for mentioning them in this ]mper is that during the 

 first week in July, 1M!)7, I twice heard a song in the depths of a 

 hemlock forest near l)imo<-k, which, although 1 am not familiar 

 with the bird, I f'tit almost sure was the note of a Winter Wren. 

 This would seem to point at least to the possibilitv of its breeding. 



In the open laml throughout the greater part of the county, es- 

 j)ecially in moist upland meadows, Savannah Sparrows are very 

 common, generally breeding in small colonies; while at Dundafi, in 

 the southeastern portion, in open fields at an altitude of some 2,000

feet, the Bobolink is an ahuDilant breeder, also occurring locally at 

 many points in the central and eastern j)art oftiie county. 



As to the occurrence of several species of water birds during the 

 breeding season in Susquehanna County, I can state nothing posi- 

 tive, not having visited several of tlie more retired lakes and streams 

 in the northwestern portion of the county, where they would be 

 most likely to be found. 



To sum up, I think it may be said that the fauna of Susquehanna 

 County is largely Alleghenian, with a strong tinge of the Canadian, 

 but with practically nothing of what may be regarded as belonging 

 exclusively to the Carolinian element. To be sure. Dr. Warren 

 (Birds of Pefnisij/vdiiia, p. 300) mentions having taken a Hooded 

 Warbier in the county during the summer months, while on August 

 10, 1895. I shot a pair of adult Prothonotary Warblers near Dim- 

 ock, l)ut these species can hardly be regarded as more than strag- 

 glers. 



In the following list I have made no mention of the birds breed- 

 ing, as with few exceptions all the individuals noted during the last 

 of June and early part of July may reasonably be assumed to be 

 summer residents and to be breeding in the locality where seen. 



Such species as have not come under my personal observation or 

 whose status as breeders may be doubtful, have been placed in 

 brackets. 



Before concluding, I desire to express my thanks to Mr. AVitmer 

 Stone, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, who 

 visited the county in June 1896 and 1897, and who has rendered 

 valuable assistance in many ways. 



[1. Aix sponsa. Wood Duck. 



Formerly a common breeder in the more retired lakes and 

 streams, but now decidedly rare. A pair seen during the early part 

 of August, 1895, near a wild overgrown pond in the vicinity of 

 Dimock only points to the probability of its breeding]. 



2. Ardea herodias. (Jrtat IJIue Htion. 



Kare. Scattered pairs occasionally seen along the larger streams 

 throughout the county. 



3. Ardea virescens. (iretn Jlcron. 



Tolerably common, but like the last never found breeding in col- 

 onies, there being generally but a single pair in one locality. The 

 birds, h(nvever, show great partiality for the old breeding grounds, 

 and generally return to the same spot year after year. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 79 



4. Nycticorax nycticorax naevius. Black-crowneil Xij^hc Heron. 



This species has been observed but rarely during the breeding 

 season, though there seems to be no reason why it should not be 

 plentiful. 



6. Philohela minor. American Wooileoek. 



Rather common, but yearly becoming scarcer as a breeder. 



6. Bartramia longicauda. Bartnimian Sandpiper. 



One bird observed in an upland pasture near Dimock, June 

 19, 1897, and evidently breeding from its actions, is my only record 

 for the county. 



7. Actitis maoularia. .''potted Sandpi|>er. 

 Common in all suitable localities. 



8. Colinus virginianus. I'.ob-white. 



Much less common now than formerly, but solitary individuals 

 and an occasional covey are still frequently met with. During the 

 last two years, however, there has l)een a noticeable increa-se in the 

 numbers of this l)ir(l throu;^huut the county. 



9. Bonasa umbellus. lUitred (jrou.-ic. 



More plentiful than C. virgininnus, but fast becoming rarer as 

 the forests are cut away, tiius depriving it of suitable breeding 

 grounds and hiding places. 



[10. Ectopistes migratorius. I'asHenger Pigeon. 



A flock of four was seen July 19, 1897, in a dead chestnut tree 

 on the ctlge of a strip of Wdodland near Dimock. Although I had 

 a good look at the birds through my gla.ss and feel no reasoiuible 

 doubt as to the identity, I was unfortunately unable to secure any 

 of them. This species is known to have formerly been an abundant 

 l)ri'eder in Susquehanna County, iuit these are the first individuals 

 seen for many years. This occurrence at this .season of the year 

 may possibly indicate that they still ne.st occasionally in the wilder 

 parts of the county]. 



IL Zenaidura macroura. .Mourniii); l)ov«-. 



This specirs, which may be regarded as common to the Alleghe- 

 nian and Carolinian zones, though perhaps more typical of the lat- 

 ter, is not uncommon in some localities, although decidedly rare in 

 others. 




80 PROCKKDINOS OF THE ACADKMY OF [1898. 



12. Circus hudsonius. .Marsh lliiwk. 



The county is seemingly far too hilly and mountainous to suit the 

 habits of tliis hawk, but nevertheless a pair has been seen regularly 

 during June and July for several years past on a small marshy 

 nieadnw surrounding Elk Lake, and doubtless l)reeds there. 



13. Accipiter velox. Sharp-shiniied Ilnwk. 



Rather coniiuon, being frequently met with during the breeding 

 season. 



14. Accipiter cooperi. Co()i)er's Hawk. 



Rare and much less common than the preceding. 



15. Buteo borealis. Reil-tailcd Hawk. 



Decidedly tlie most abundant hawk in the county, a few being 

 seen almost daily. 



16. Buteo lineatus. Red-shouldered Hawk. 



Probably ranks next to B. borealis in abundance. 



17. Falco sparverius. Sparrow Hawk. 



Rather common. 



[18. Syrnium nebulosum. Barred Owl. 



The only record which I have of the occurrence of this owl in 

 summer time is an adult male shot by a friend during the latter part 

 of August, 1897. It may doubtless be regarded as a rare perma- 

 nent resident]. 



19. Megascops asio. Screech Owl. 

 Common resident. 



20. Bubo virginianus. (Jreat-homed Owl. 



Tolerably common resident in the deeper forests throughout the 

 county. 



21. Coccyzus erythrophthalmus. T51ack-billed Cuckoo. 

 Not uncommon, during the breeding season. 



22. Ceryle alcyon. IJcltod Kin;;fi<hiT. 



Tolerably common along the banks of ponds and streams, being 

 especially abundant at Silver Lake in the northwestern jmrt of the 

 county. 



23. Dryobates villosus. Hairy Woodpecker. 



Common throughout the wooded portions. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 81 



24. Dryobates pubescens. Downy Woodpecker. 



Abundant and generally distributed, both in the woodland and 

 in the open country. 



[25. Ceophloeus pileatus. I'ileuteil Woodpceker. 



Personally I have never observed this si)ecies during the breed- 

 ing season, but as several specimens have been taken during the 

 early part of August, it doubtless breeds sparingly]. 



26. Melanerpes erythrocephalus. Ked-beaded Woodpecker. 



Rare. A pair was observed at Dundaff, June, 1895, and a single 

 bird near Montrose in June, 1896. 



27. Colaptes auratus. Flicker. 

 Abundant everywhere. 



28. Antrostomus vociferus. Whip-poor-will. 



Very rare, having been only once or twice noted in low, secluded 

 spots. 



29. Chordeiles virginianns. Niv^ht Hawk. 



Very cofninon, collecting in large flocks during August. 



30. Chaetura pelagica. Clmnney .^witt. 



Abundant, breeding throughout the county. It has, however, 

 adapted itself to the ways of civilization and has never been ob- 

 served nesting in hollow trees. 



31. Trochilns colubris. riuby-tliroaleil Iluinmin^'-hird. 

 Coniinoii, lioth about h<juses and in the deep woods. 



32. Tyrannus tyrannus. Kinj,'l>lril. 

 Abiiiidaiit and generally clistributed. 



33. Myiarchus crinitus. (JriMi iTr.«t<-.| Flycneclicr.

36. Empidonax minimus. Lcmt Klycatrhcr. 



Very coninion and universally distributed liuring the breeding 

 season. 




82 PROCEEDINGS OF THK A(A1)I:MY OF [1898. 



37. Otoooris alpestris pratioola. 1'raiiio llonuJ l/urk. 



Although til is species has been recorded during the lireeding sea- 

 son by Messrs. D wight and Parke at Athens. Bradford (.'ounty, at 

 Williatnsport (Koch), and in FAk County (Baily), it has never, to 

 my knowledge, been observed in this county until the summer of 

 1896, when a bird was noted July 6, in a grassy meadow near 

 Dimock. 



38. Cyanocitta cristata. Blue Jay. 

 Abundant, especially in woody situations. 



39. Corvus americanus. American Crow. 

 Abundant. 



40. Dolichonyx oryzivorus. Boliolink. 



A common breeder, but decidedly local in its distrii)ution, al- 

 though isolated pairs may be found in all suitable localities through- 

 out the county. At Dundaff, a small village in the southeastern 

 part, at an elevation of 1,620 feet, upward of two dozen pairs were 

 found breeding in June, 1895, while a small colony generally nests 

 in some upland meadows near Dimock. 



It may also be of interest to note that two pairs of this species 

 were observed at Waymart, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, June 

 22, 1895, and four pairs near Sugarloaf Mountain on the western 

 border of the same county, June 23, 1897. 



41. Molothrus ater. Cowliird. 

 Kather common. 



42. Agelaius phoenicens. Red-winged Blackbird. 



Locally common, breeding plentifully on the marshes of several 

 lakes near Dimock, where I have taken fresh eggs as late as the first 

 of July. 



43. Sturnella magna. Meadow Lark. 



Very common and generally distributed. 



44. Icterus galbula. Baltimore Oriole. 



Common about houses and generally distributed, apparently in- 

 creasing in abundance. 



46. Quiacalus quiscula aeneus. Bronzed (?) Crackle. 



While on a collecting trip with Mr. Witmer Stone in the north- 

 western part of the county, June 22, 1897, a single Crackle wasob- 

 served, presumably Q. q. aeneus. Unfortunately neither of us was 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 83 



able to secure the bird ; but from its actions it was undoubtedly 

 nesting in the neighborhood. This record seems interesting as being 

 the first evidence, to my knowledge, of the occurrence of any species 

 of Grackle in Susquehanna County. 



46. Carpodacua purpureus. Purple Finch. 



Not uncommon, both in the woodland and in the open country 

 about houses, where its pretty song may be heard from April to the 

 middle of July. 



47. Passer domesticus. English Spr.rn»w. 



This pest, everywhere ra[)idly increasing in numbers, and now 

 resident in almost every town and village of any size throughout the 

 county, bids fair to .soon drive away all the old feathered songsters 

 from our gardens and orchards. 



48. Spinas tristis. American (ioldfinch. 

 Abundant everywhere. 



49. Poocaetes gramineus. Ve.-per Sjisirrow. 



The most abundant and generally distributed of the sparrows 

 during the breeding season ; in fact, one of the characteristic birds 

 of the open country. 



50. Ammodramus sandwichensis savanna, .^nvannnh .sparrow. 



Very common and widely distriliuted in all suitable localities, 

 especially in the northern and f'a.^tern portions of the county. 

 61. Ammodramus savannarum passerinus. (;ras-hMi)i.er Sparrow. 



Common in dry u|)lands. 



52. Spizella socialis. < liiiipiiii; .'Sparrow. 

 .\l)iindiiiit. 



53. Spizella pusilla. Ficl<l .'Sparn.w. 



.\l)un(liint in open fields and overgrown pastures. 

 64. Junco hyemalii. Slnic ci'li.nil .liiiic->. 



P^ormerly common at Elk .Nfountain, from 2,000 feet up, and gen- 

 erally confined to open field.'*, but now (luiterare. Its occurrence in 

 the rest of the county is limited to two records: First, a single pair 

 shot June 26, IHlJf;, near Dimock, and .secondly, another pair 

 engaged in cvjustructing a nest near the same locality, April 24, 

 181>7. One would expect to find this .-species in the elevated plateau 

 land of Ararat towuHJiij), on the ea.-tern border of the county, a 

 locality well suited to its habits; but on a vi.'^it to this region in 




84 PROCEKDINGS OF THK ACADKMY OF [1898. 



June, 1H97, I (lid not meet with a single individual, although it was 

 found three miles to the eastward, on Sugarloaf Mountain, in Wayne 

 County. 



65. Melospiza fasciata. Song Sjmrmw. 



Abundant everywhere, except in the deep woods. 

 56. Melospiza georgiana. Swump Sjiarrow. 



Rather common in low swampy situations. 

 67. Pipilo erythrophthalmus. Ti>wlue. 



Tolerably conimon in scruhby fields and clearings. 

 58. Zamelodia ludovioiana. Hose-brcaiited (irusbcak. 



This species seems to be very rare, having only been observed 

 once during the breeding season, when a fine male wa.s shot June 22, 

 1896, in an old clearing near Dimock. 



69. Passerina cyanea. Indigo Bird. 



Abundant, especially in briar patches and clearings, where the 

 males may be heard singing all day long. 



60. Firanga erythromelas. i^carlet Tanager. 

 Very common throughout the deep woods. 



61. Petrochelidon lunifrons. Cliff Swallow. 



Common, but rather local in its distribution, and generally found 

 breeding in colonies. It has of late years been gradually decreasing 

 in abundance. 



62. Chelidon erythrogaster. JJain Swallow. 



]\[ore abundant and generally distributed throughout the county 

 than the preceding species. 



63. Tachycineta bicolor. Tree Swallow. 



Rare. Scattered pairs occasionally seen in suitable localities. 



64. Ampelis cedrorum. (Vdar liird. 



Common summer resident, occurring in large flocks during June 

 and again in September. 



65. Vireo olivaceas. Red-eyed Vireo. 



Very abundant, both in the shade trees about houses and in the 

 deep woods. 



66. Vireo gilvus. Warbling Vireo. 



A nest with three young, collected by Mr. Stone and myself near 

 Milford, June 22, 1897, is the only record which I have of its 

 occurrence in Susquehanna County. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 85 



67. Vireo flavifrons. Yellow-throated Vireo. 



Not uncoinnion, being frequently met with during the breeding 

 season, especially in the deep woods. 



68. Vireo solitarius. Blue-headed Vireo. 



Common in the deep forests throughout the greater portion of 

 the county, one or more pairs being usually met with in all 

 the larger pieces of woodland. Two adults with young just out 

 of the nest and nut yet able to fly were observed July 8, 1896, 

 about two miles south of Springville. 



69. Hniotilta varia. HIack and White Warbkr. 



Tolerably common in second growth woods and clearings. 



70. Compsothlypis americana. Pamla Warbk-r. 



Not uncommon, and several times met with in woods where there 

 is apparently no usnea moss. It would be interesting to know what 

 the l)ird constructs its nest of in such localities. 



71. Dendroica aestiva. Yellow Warbkr. 

 Common throutrhout the open country. 



72. Dendroica caerulescens. IJIack-thrnateil I'.lue Warliler. 



Aljundant and generally distributed in the deep hemlock woods, 

 being, perhaps, the commonest representative of its genus. 



73. Dendroica maculosa. .Magnolia Warbler. 



Another very common species, almost as plentiful as the prcced- 

 ir)g, but like it confined to the deep hemlock woods. 



74. Dendroica pennsylvanica. ('he.ftnui-sidtNi Warbler. 



Common, but confined to the clearings and tracts of 'scrub.' A 

 nest together with the brood of young birds was discovered June 27, 

 189(i, in a small orchard within a few yards of the house. 



75. Dendroica blackburniee. Itlackburnian WarbN-r. 



AI)Mn(iaiit wherever there is a thick growth of hemlock. It 

 would be hard to say whether this species or I), cuerii/enrcns is the 

 more plentiful, for as Dr. Dwight remarks, there are " places where 

 both might almost be said to swarm." 



76. Dendroica virens. IIInck-ihri>ntcd <;rccn Warbler. 



Al.-io :il»undant in the deep hemlock forests, but hiiidly as plenti- 

 ful as the preceding 8i)ecies. 



77. Seiurus aurocapillai. <»\en bird. 

 Abundant everywhere. 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



78. Seiurus noveboraoensis. Watrr Thrush. 



This typical Canailiaii species seeiHS to be decidedly rare, the only 

 record for the county being one immature female shot .June 26, 189G. 

 This bird was secured in a dense swamp containing a sparse growth 

 of rhododendron, and had evidently been out of the nest but a short 

 time. 



79. Geothlypis trichas. Maryland Yellow-thront. 



Very common, but confined to clearings and open grounds, and 

 seldom noted in the deep woods. 



80. Sylvania canadensis. Canailian Warbler. 



Another species belonging to the Canadian fauna, and one almost 

 as abundant as D. caerulescenx. It is found throughout the county, 

 in the lower and damper portions of the deep forests, generally, but 

 not always, where there is a thick growth of hemlock. 



Personally I have never detected the Redstart ( SetopJiat/d ruticilla) 

 during the breeding season in this county, but during the latter part 

 of June, 1895, 1 found it to be very common in portions of Wayne 

 County and at Lake Teedyuskung, Pike County. 



81. Galeoscoptes carolinensis. Catbird. 



A common species in the oj)en country. 



82. Harporhynchus rufus. limwn Thraslier. 



Rather rare in the central and northern parts of the county, in- 

 creasing in abundance toward the southern border. Observed only 

 in scrubby fields and clearings. 



83. Troglodytes aedon. House Wren. 

 Tolerably common about houses. 



[84. Troglodytes hyemalis. \Vintcr Wren. 



Very rare. As previously remarked, the song has been detected 

 several times during the early summer in the deep hemlock woods 

 near Dimock, and leads me to think that it probably breeds spa- 

 ringly in the wildest portions of the county]. 



The Brown Creeper, Certhia jamiliaris americana, although re- 

 corded by Messrs. Dwight, Baily and Stone from Sullivan, Elk and 

 Luzerne Counties respectively, has never been observed by me in 

 Susquehanna County during the breeding season, and if it does 

 occur, n)u.-t be regarded as a very rare summer resident. 



85. Sitta carolinensis. White-ljrea.^ted Nuthatch. 



Very common, both in the woods and in the open country. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



86. Parus atricapillus. Bhuk-capped Chickadee. 

 Abundant in the woodland. 



87. Turdua mustelinas. Wood Thru-b. 



A coninion species and generally confined to the deep woods. A 

 nest containing- young nearly ready to fly was discovered, however, 

 June 18, 1890, situated in a young maple tree on the border of 

 the woods within a few rods of the house. The female bird was ex- 

 ceedingly tame, allowing approach within a foot of the nest, but 

 usually this species lacks much of the tanieness and confidence 

 which so characterizes it in the more densely populated portions of 

 the country. 



88. Turdus fuacescens. Wil-nn's Tbrusli. • 



Very al)undant in dense, swan)py woodland throughout the 

 county. Owing to its .shyness and the inaccessibility of the locali- 

 ties which it generally inhabits, the bird is very difficult to 

 approach, but its presence is always betrayed by its wild bell-like 

 notes, which may be heard at all hours of the day, but which sound 

 the sweetest in the early morning and about sunset. It is almost 

 impossible to in)itate the song on paper, but the syllables " ta-weel'ah, 

 ta-weel'ah, twil'ah, twil'ah," mentioned in Baird, Brewer and 

 Kidgway's North Avurican Hir(l< (Vol. I, p. 9), convey to my ear 

 the most accurate de8cri[)tion of it which I have.*een. After careful 

 oljservation and .study, I am {)rcj)ared to say that thi.s is one of the 

 most plentiful of the TurduUK in Susquehanna County, .surpassing 

 in abundance both T. mnsfelhms and pallnsii. 



89. Turdas aoaalaschkae pallasii. II> unit TliniKli. 



Tolerably common wherever the hemlock remains uncut, but 

 hardly as [)lentiful as T. inii.iteliuus, being ab.sent in many of the 

 localities where the latter is c<»m[)aratively common. I have, on 

 many occasions, however, ob.servcd the two species singing almost 

 side by side, and fully agree with other ob.-^ervers that the song of 

 the Hermit is considerably superior to that of the Wood Thrush, 

 possessing as Dr. Dwight reniarks, " a ringing sweetne.«s that is only 

 matched in part by the latter." 



90. Kerala migratoria. .American Robin. 



Common everywhere throughout the county, e.\ce[)t in the deep 

 woods.

 a single individual was observed anywhere in the county, but during 

 June and July, 1890, several broods were noted, while in 1897 the 

 species was quite common again.

VOLCANIC ROCKS OF MESOZOIC AGE IN PENNSYLVANIA. 

 BY E. GOLDSMITH. 



My petrographical and geological observations have convinced 

 me that nearly all so called '"trap" is of volcanic origin. Sup- 

 porting proofs may be found in many localities near Pliihidelphiaj 

 such as the Haycock Mountain, New Hope and the railroad cuts 

 north and south of Quakertown in Bucks County, Pa. The richest 

 field of observation, however, is the hill four miles north of Potts- 

 town, ^lontgomery County. The various outcrops of the volcanic 

 rocks may there be studied to greater advantage than in the other 

 localities. 



One hundred and fifty acres of the top and side of the hill now 

 form a public jmrk, much of the rubbish and underbrush being, 

 therefore, removed. A series of volcanic terraces of Mesozoic age 

 has been thus uncovered and is, I think, worth recording. These 

 terraces were formed by four distinct outflows of lava. The four, 

 five or six sided columns of greenstone-basalt can be seen on the 

 edge of each step from the first outpour. The first outflow had a 

 range wider in extent than the others ; the second was less, to all 

 present appearances; the third eruption was decidedly less great, 

 whilst the fourth, the top of the hill, exceeded the second and 

 third in mass of material. The greatest difference between the 

 levels of the various outpours is seen between the third and the 

 fourth flow. The whole extent of these terraces is overshadowed 

 by a grove of trees and carpeted with grass and other small plants, 

 an illustration would, therefore, be indistinct. 



A strictly scientific examination of the terraces would involve a 

 survey, the removal of rubbish and sod down to the lava and the 

 determination of the various levels with instruments of precision. 



The terraces are situated on the western side of the park. The 

 level forms a plateau on which a fine iron structure has been built 

 to a height of some twenty or more feet above the trees, an obser- 

 vation tower, from the upper platform of which a grand view of 

 part of the Schuylkill valley can be obtained. Near this point, in 

 a j)ile of debris, the first indications of a devitrified obsidian or tach- 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



ilyte were found. On a later visit I observed a slab of about three 

 feet in length and about six inches thick imbedded in a b;ink of 

 debris of similar material; many indications of the volcanic rock 

 being scattered about. The rock is jet black, dull, very fine grained, 

 with distinct conchoidal fracture, the edges becoming very sharp; 

 the hardness is a little less than quartz. The per centage of silica 

 was 57.1. Under the microscope was observed a microperlitic 

 structure. All attempts to secure a photograph of this structure 

 failed. 



A second variety of tachilyte was found, but not so abundantly as 

 the first. It is also deej) black and very fine grained, very thin 

 white slreak.s or lines being irregularly distributed through the 

 mass. Under the microscope, the thin section showed again that 

 the essential mtiterial con.«i.<t8 of devitrified glass darkened by an 

 extremely fine powder of what seemed to be magnetite. The white 

 lines, suggestive of crystals, ap})eared when magnified as elongated 

 globular forms filled with a partially cry.-^talline substance of indis- 

 tinct crystalline forms. The globules consist of subcrystalline mate- 

 rial, filling what was originally gas pores. A section showed also 

 the fluid structure. With very strong, light, numerous crystallites 

 were observed. 



A third variety of devitrilied glass has a yellow-gray color. This 

 tachilyte is very hard and so ])eculiarly splintery, sharp edged and 

 curved, that no fragment (-((uld Ix* secured with the hammer from 

 which to grind a section, the lapidary having to cut the plates for 

 the purpose. The mineral is very fine grained and even, some 

 specimens having a yellow edge apparently of the same lianlncss as 

 the general ma.'S. Where water had aUc-cti'd the material there is 

 a thin rusty coating. 



With ordinary light, a thin .'*eclion .^how.< beneath the micr().scoj)e, 

 that the ma--8 of rock is made up of largely predominating fine 

 ash-like granule.^ interspersed with minute fragments of crystalline 

 material, the whole cemented together by devitrifieil glass.' 



' .\l)Oiit nix years ago, I found a specimen of rock near Kockliill Statii>n, in 

 Bucks County, and (Ktermined it uniier the name of I'elsite. It seems to me, 

 that Felsiie, Eiirite, I'etrosiiex and I'acliilyte are all liie same in composition 

 structure and origin. .Mi these rocks seem to t)clong t<> the glassy hivns, and 

 are, therefore, in all prohability, of volcanic origin. Since the inner structure 

 and mineral composition should decide the iiamt of a rock, it is thought best 

 to call this, anil all three varieties, ra<:hilyte, because the principal ma-s is 

 devitrilied obsidian, a.s has already been suggested by several Hritish petro- \ 

 graphers, and, since l'>reilhau[it'8 name seenxs to have the priority, it should, 

 I think, be retained by geologists.

Eastward from the upper plateau of the terrace is an opeu area 

 devoid of plant life. It is called by the people the " Great Ringers," 

 Plate II, in contradistinctit)n to the " Little Ringers," which are 

 situated on east side of the park. The outcrop consists of rocks of 

 various sizes, from a hand specimen to those weighing thirty tons or 

 more. They are essentially gabhro-phonolite, as I stated in a com- 

 munication made several years ago to the Academy. I then an- 

 nounced the mineralogical composition of these ro(;ks to be: 

 plagioclastic feldspar, sanidine, diallage, augite, magnetite; ferrite 

 also was occasion all}' present. These rocks are very tough and 

 close-grained. Even a thin section has a considerable cohesion and 

 does not break in boiling in spirits of turpentine, unless the outer 

 weathered gray crust be taken. This is brittle when thus tested. 



Plate I illustrates a small section of this singular rock formation. 

 The outcrop has precisely the appearance of what has been called an 

 Einsturzkrater^ or collapsed crater. The crater in its present condi- 

 tion is but a fraction of what it was formerly. Its former horizon can 

 still be traced ; vegetation has gradually encroached upon it and, if 

 not prevented, will cover the entire tract which is now bare. The 

 outlines of volcanic craters are extremely irregular everywhere, 

 whether the walls are still standing or have fallen in. The contour 

 may be traced, however, in either case, the rocks themselves being 

 the guides. It can be shown that in the building up of the eleva- 

 tion, various phases of volcanic action must have taken place to ac- 

 complish that which ultimately resulted. It seems probable, as has 

 been suggested, I think by Geike, and even observed by him and 

 others, that the phonolites are formed on the upper neck of the vol- 

 cano, and that the basalts are liquid lava j)oured out from some 

 point along the side of the crater. Similar relations appear to have 

 existed in the building up of the Pottstown Hill. The metallic 

 sounds emitted from the rocks, when struck with a hammer, are of 

 great interest to visitors, and both superstition and poetry are in- 

 cited thereby. The phonolites of this locality however, lose their 

 ringing property when broken. It seems probable that this eflectis 

 due to the production of innumerable cracks through the whole 

 mass, just as a metallic bell or a glass jar loses the property of 

 ringing when cracked. There are, however, some phonolites, as 

 those occurring north of Wilmington, Delaware, and on Haycock

Mountain, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which retain tlie metal- 

 lic sound when broken. 



The Little Ringers, as they are termed, are essentially the same 

 aa those described above. The outcrop, thickly covered by trees, is 

 situated about a quarter of a mile east of the others, and may be an 

 indication of a separate neck of a crater. The outcrop appears 

 small because the trees have taken possession of the surroundings. 



There is probably more 

 of it than can be seen 

 at present. If not pre- 

 vented, the trees will 

 cover the Little Ringers 

 in the course of time as 

 certainly as nine-tenths 

 of the whole area of the 

 liill is now covered. 



Not far from the Rail- 

 way Station on the hill, 

 borings for water were 

 made without result. 

 Some of the rock frag- 

 ments brought to the 

 surface indicated a bed 

 of amygdaloid of a pale 

 grayish color; the thick- 

 ness of the bed was not 

 ascertained and is at 

 present unknown. 

 Specimens of amygda- 

 loid are found on the 

 surface, one of which 

 had the almond shaped 

 nodules of more than an 

 inch in length and protruding from the rock nearly half an inch. 

 An interesting specimen of amygdaloid with an uncommon fluidal 

 texture is represented by the figure 1. It gives a fair idea of the 

 8pe«.ifiien, the ligliter shade above and the darker below l)eing 

 sharply defined. The fluidal texture is usually observal)le only in 

 thin sections under the microscope, but in this case, we have it nia- 

 cro.scopically. When magnified the thin section showed a great

many small blisters or former cavities filled with a si ill whiter ma- 

 terial than the honeycombed mass in general. The lighter part of 

 the mass contained but little magnetite, while the dark portion was 

 filled with this iron ore. As i)lut()nic rocks do not possess any 

 amygdaloid texture, I have concluded that those found in the Potts- 

 town park are of volcanic origin, that they were once a fluid lava 

 and that the rock masses as they appear are the remnants of a col- 

 lapsed crater. 



Microscopic examination of thin sections gave the following re- 

 sult:— 



The infiltrated material in the former gas cavities appeared by 

 reflected light as white, opaque, granular masses, which could not 

 be resolved even when magnified to about three hundred diameters 

 into any distinct crystalline form. Nevertheless, that it possessed 

 crystalline structure is indicated by its aspect in polarized light. 

 I diagnose the material as feldspatic. AVith ordinary light and with 

 the aid of an Abbe condenser the rock mass showed a faint green 

 augite ; the particles, very finely divided, often appeared together 

 in groups, and these small greenish individuals having a greater 

 refractive index than the feldspar, were, in consequence, more con- 

 spicuous than the greater mass of the rock. In polarized light the 

 feldsi)ar appeared to be essentially ortlioclase, some sanidiiie being 

 also present. This volcanic rock may be compared with the amyg- 

 daloidal basalt of Schlachenwerth, near Carlsbad, Bohemia. 



A geaeral description of the rocks on the eastern side of the hill 

 is also of special interest. The enormous size of some of the sections 

 of liasaitic columns found there, some undoubtedly in situ, others 

 removed to a lower level, is such as to cause surprise. These basalts 

 are mostly six-sided, and as the result of weathering, somewhat 

 rounded on their edges ; some are perfectly flat and level, others are 

 found with a concavity varying in dej)th, while some have been seen 

 with a wavy surface. Some of the columns do not seem to split 

 transversely, but stretch their bulky length some twenty feet or more 

 along the ground. One has l)een named the Bullfrog by the natives. 

 The diameters of the six-sided sections of the basalt vary. I meas- 

 ured some which were ten, eleven or fifteen feet across. These 

 gigantic illustrations of mountain-makiiig may indicate a peculiar 

 geologic condition wherein a long continued internal heat, or possi- 

 bly a slow cooling dependent ujion external causes, prevented the 

 contraction of the general mass into smaller columns such as are so 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 95 



ofteu found occurring in the Tertiary and more recent periods. I 

 confess that nowhere in my travels, either in this country or in 

 Europe, did I observe such colossi of basaltic columns. When 

 in their entirety they must have been giant structures in the strict- 

 est sense of the phrase. An interesting and very suggestive rock 

 received the iian)e of the Haystack from the owner of the place. 

 Plate III represents the same as viewed from the southern side. 

 As the illustration indicates, the side to the right is convex, and if 

 one stands where he can see the convexity only, a sirailiarity to a 

 haystack or the section of one may suggest itself. 



On close examination I found that the inclined position of the 

 rock was due to tilting, and that formerly it must have stood erect ; 

 it can also be shown that the rocks to the left were parts of the 

 same, and, if the losses through erosion are ahso taken into account, 

 the Haystack had, in all probability, another outline than the one 

 which it now presents. It seems clear to me that this tall object 

 was originally triangular in form, that it is the last remnant of a 

 crater wall standing there almost separated from the other parts of 

 the crater which lie to the north, iKMthwest and west, while the 

 southern side has entirely collapsed. 



Whoever has clo.sely ol»serve<l the structure of recent volcanoes, 

 is aware that if it were possible to make a vertical section of the 

 crater wall, that section would necessarily he triangular in form. 

 If it were possible to obtain it, a birds eye view would render the 

 significance of the aspe<;t more convincing. A photograph of the 

 crater wall-section from the west side, Plate IV, represents it fairly 

 well. The camera stood about half way up on the opposite slope, 

 a position which accounts for the de[)ressi(in shown in the central 

 fore ground of the (»icture. The part from the standing rock to the 

 left, above, is corroded away, plant life here, as everywhere, having 

 douhtiess (■oiitril)utfd its share toward the (h'struction of these rocks. 

 The huge blocks seen in front of the tall -ection, are those wliich I 

 believe to have been formerly united with the so-called Haystack to 

 f(»rm the triangular part of the crater wall. Everybody who has 

 paitl the least attention to the study of rocks i.s accjuainted with 

 their continual disintegration, effected by heat and moisture work- 

 ing inward from the exposed surfaces of even the hardest and tough- 

 est rocks. The tall crater wall-section shows even now a great 

 many cracks, esj)ecially on its convex side, and it .«een)8 evident 

 that it will not require many years to complete its destruction. Its 




i^>6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



present inclined position will probaijly cause the fall of the upper 

 part first, thus ohiiterating another proof of what the structure was 

 in former times. Professor Oscar Carter said, when I showed him 

 the object in question and pointed out its significance: " A very 

 suggestive specimen, what else could it represent? It appears to be 

 a last remnant of the wall of a crater." Of course, it requires some 

 little imagination to see such a connection, but the principal empha- 

 sis is laid on the surroundings and upon the cumulative proofo of 

 the volcanic rocks themselves. 



From the Haystack a narrow winding path in a general north- 

 easterly direction leads to an immense platform of ba-salt known as 

 Table Rock. Of this no photograph was taken, in order to spare 

 the remaining plate for the picture of the entrance to the cave. In 

 Plate V the entrance of what the people call the cave, is plainly 

 noticeable among the huge and i)artly broken rocks. The large 

 block lying on the left shows the triangular contour of the cross cut 

 of a crater wall in a manner sufficiently characteristic. The col- 

 lapsing process and the gradual breaking up of the great masses of 

 rock are at least partially recognizable in the illustration. To ob- 

 tain a general idea of what that cave really is, however, one must 

 ascend the debris surrounding the great wall of massive blocks, 

 climb upward along a rustic step-walk, mount upon the top of the 

 wall and gaze down into the cavity. The deep kettle-shaped cavity 

 is formed by the rock masses which are more or less split in various 

 directions, but the greater number are vertically cleft. That this is 

 an ancieilt crater I liave not the slightest doubt ; that the formation 

 has never been a cave in the geological sense of the word is clear 

 from the fact that volcanic rocks never form hollow domes. It is, 

 however, possible to creep into the cauldron from the side entrance, 

 and boys are occasionally seen sliding or climbing down into the 

 hollow space from above. 



Volcanic craters vary a great deal in diameter; this one is small, 

 its inside measure amounts, I think, to not much more than forty 

 feet, and in its depth somewhat less. Since the wall rocks of this 

 crater are cracked vertically and in the inner parts moved toward 

 the centre, it is self-evident that the inner diameter must have been 

 greater in the past. Here, as in other partsof the hill, the trees are 

 doing their work steadily, breaking the larger blocks into smaller 

 ones; the decay is continually going on, and although the entire 

 sleeping crater is still standing where it was built by the ancient 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



fluid lavas of the Mesozoic era, it is only a question of time when 

 this one also will have been disrupted and obliterated like its an- 

 cient colleagues of the vicinity. 



Ancient craters necessarily decay and crumble away just as any 

 other exposure of rock will do. It is well-known to those versed in 

 the special literature of the subject, that collapsed craters have been 

 found and recognized in Europe, and it might reasonably be ex- 

 pected that in time the discovery of similar f)henomena existing here 

 would result from careful observation. 



In the literature of the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylva- 

 nia nothing i? mentioned of the Pottstown Hill, except that Trap 

 occurs there. But that an entire crater of Mesozoic age is still in- 

 tact at that spot nobody seems to have even guessed ; at least no 

 geologist appears to have looked at it, much less to have explored 

 or described it. That the deep cauldron is an ancient crater, I am 

 fully convinced.

THE PETRIFACTION OF FOSSIL BONES. 

 BY E. GOLDSMITH. 



The Port Kennedy limestone quarry, situated on the Schuylkill 

 River, in Montgomery Co., Pa., became noted some twenty-five years 

 ago for a deposit of fossil bones which were studied, in part, by Pro- 

 fessors Joseph Leidy and Edw. D. Cope. Recently a fresh interest 

 in the subject was awakened, and Mr. Mercer, the well-known archae- 

 ologist, superintended some further difrgings, especially in the hope 

 of finding human remains in the fissure, the receptacle of the fossils, 

 in the Silurian limestone. 



Mr. Mercer's statement that a considerable part of those fossil 

 bones crumbled, or, as he expressed it, " fell to a mealy powder" 

 when touched, attracted my attention. In order to ascertain into 

 what form and composition the bone-phosj)hate had been changed, 

 I visited the locality and saw the peculiar position of the fissure 

 filled with the moist debris derived from the overlying Mesozoicred 

 sandstone. The mealy matter above referred to was easily found 

 because there was more of it than solid fossil bones ; although it is 

 astonishing how many fragments of bones were in view, a sight de- 

 lightful to the paleontologist. 



I selected for my investigation a curved bone, apparently a trans- 

 verse section of a scapula of perhaps one of the larger cats, about | 

 of an inch thick in the middle and tai)ering toward both ends. 

 Clean material could easily be dug out with a knife. On drying 

 the sample it appears as a yellowish, fine sand of even grain : Mr. 

 Mercer's fossil bone meal. This fine grained mealy material was 

 certainly at one time, a portion of a bone ; but its composition is no 

 longer calcium phosphate, a chemical analysis proving that phos- 

 phoric acid was almost or entirely absent. The reaction for phos- 

 phoric acid with the ammonium molybdate solution was very slight, 

 there seemed to l)e but a small fraction of one per cent, of the cal- 

 cium phosphate left in the specimen. It was further ascertained 

 that this so-called bone-meal is now essentially calcium carbonate 

 containing some magnesia. Is this material really amorplious as it 

 appears under ordinary conditions? A slide, prepared in the ordi-

nary way with balsam indicated beneath the microscope that nearly 

 every particle had crystallized into a mineral. Groups of three or 

 six crystals were recognized with a low power objective. In polar- 

 ized light some of the crystals showed extinction parallel to the 

 longer axis. 



A pile of rul)bi;h, which had been dug out of the bone-bed-fissure 

 from which Professors ]\Iercer and Cope had selected all that was 

 worth having, contained some bone fragments in which the cellular 

 structure of bone could be observed and also the gradual transition 

 into the mealy condition or complete metamorphosis of bone phos- 

 })hate into a mineral. I think a better proof could hardly be given 

 of the gradual metainorphic change that has taken place in that 

 locality. It seems to me that this fissure, which is V-shaped, had 

 no outlet for the water which soaked the mixture of bones, ferrugi- 

 nous clay, twigs, fragments of sandstone, etc. and that the oppor- 

 tunity for mutual chemical dissociation was favorable to that effect. 

 That carbon dioxide along with the water effected the change from 

 the organic to the mineral in this case as in many others, scarcely 

 require.^ demonstration. The phosphoric acid seemed to have been 

 transposed and reunited with ferric oxide aiid with alumina to form 

 vivianite and similar minerals, as indications of the presence of these 

 species were noticed in the pile of debris near the bone deposit. In 

 order to give some further proof of the almost complete change of 

 the \)<)ne substance from the chemical standpoint, I endeavored to 

 find the quantity of the carbonic acid gas volumetrically. I ob- 

 taineil by two measurements the average of 24.045 cubic centimeters 

 at 0°C. temperature and 7<)0 millimeters pre.-sure of carbonic acid 

 gas from lOO milligrammes of the mineral. This reduced to n)as8 

 equals 47.23 per cent. It is evident that this rather high result must 

 iiave a cause. Either there is another gas, or there is another oxide 

 beside the lime. On determining the bases a large quantity of 

 magnesia was found. The following is the result of the analysis: 



CaO 30.39 per cent. 



MgO '2(iX', per cent. 



CO, 47.23 per cent. 



Insoluble 1.79 per cent. 



1 00.24 



The insoluble part consisted mostly of sand, a trace of lime phos- 

 phate and oxide of iron. If these small quantities of phosphoric 




100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1898. 



acid, lime and oxide of iron would have been determined quantita- 

 tively, the general approximate result would not have difleied much 

 from the general result obtained. However, the ditierences appear 

 when we recompute the oxides into salts such as they really are. 

 We obtain about : 



Calcium carbonate 54.27 per cent. 



Magnesium carbonate 43,74 per cent. 



Insoluble residue 1.79 per cent. 



99.80 



From these numerical results it is plainly seen that the material 

 is the mineral dolomite. Since bone j)hosphate contains generally 

 but little magnesia, it may be assumed that this latter oxide must 

 have been added when the transformation of the bone into the min- 

 eral took place. 



Whether such a metamorphoses had ever been observed before is 

 unknown to the writer at the present time. It was unknown to a 

 number of chemists consulted, and, consequently, the conclusion was 

 reached that all the possible metamor])hic changes from the organic 

 to the mineral kingdom may not have been observed.

In the State Museum under my administration, I have recently 

 arranged and studied collections of great scientific value illustra- 

 tive of the fauna of the State of Sao Paulo. 



Of the collections made iu Brazil by T. Natterer, the mammals 

 and birds have been studied by the naturalist Pelzein, of the Vienna 

 Museum, forming an important contribution to our knowledge of 

 the fauna of Sao Paulo. Of the other groups of vertebrates but 

 little is known. For example, our largest fresh water fish, thejahu, 

 has not been described.' 



Concerning the reptiles and amphibians of Sao Paulo very little 

 is known. Boettger^ has mentioned a few species. 



In the present paper I otier a list of the reptiles of Sao Paulo, ex- 

 cluding snakes, of which, as well as of frogs, I have lately received 

 many sj)ecies not yet determined. Of the following list two species

8. Enyalius catenatus ^Viell. 



There are two forms in Sao Paulo. One of them may be the true 

 catenatus or a closely allied species, having the disposition of the 

 spots and yellow marks somewhat irregular, not existing in all 

 forms as seen in the figures of Spix (Plates XI and XIII). The 

 second form, wliicli T call variety^att^tsfa, has more affinity with E. 

 iherlugi, but the position of the nostril is nearer to the end of the 

 snout than to the orbit, quite as in catenatus, to which the tibia shows 

 analogy. A dark spot passes from the superciliary region to the 

 upper lip. A series of alternating black spots is contained in the 

 obscure vertebral band. Two large yellow lateral bands exist as 

 well as in E. iheringi. This may be, therefore, a local variety of 

 iheringi, l)ut differs in some characters. Moreover, the dark spots of 

 the face and of the extremities, especially of the lower legs, seem to 

 be characteristic of panlista, and wanting in iheringi. As I had 

 already doubts of the specific validity of iheringi, and as the new 

 variety is intermediate between iheringi and catenatus, I believe 

 that l)()tli are mere varieties of the latter. 



The description above given refers to the female, the male being 

 green without marks or spots, and not purplish as Boulenger says. 



Enyalins is not at all common and it will, therefore, be impossible 

 to obtain a sufficient representation for more conclusive studies 

 for some time.

I do not know the exact hal)itat of our example of this speeies, which 

 seems proper to the western parts of the interior. The number of 

 ventral scales is somewhat less than in Argentine examples. The 

 unicolored under side of the tail distinguishes this species very well 

 from the two others.

in two shorter than the suture between the pra^frontals, and in one

 having four. Of course there is no reason for separating as species 

 the southern examples distinguished by the smaller number of 

 annuli and which only form a variety {danvlni 1). & B.) of the 

 well known s{)ecies. 



It seems not at all justifial)le to separate as " species " each example 

 with a somewhat aberrant conformation of the head plates. As is 

 the case with the anal pores (2 or 4), and the upper labials (3 or 4), 

 the ocular also may occasionally be divided. Amphvibmm angusti-

This is the provisional list of the S. Paulo species. Hoplocercus 

 tpinosns Fitz., mentioned by Boulenger from St. Paul, may have 

 come from another South American St. Paulo, not of this State, as 

 species of Crocodilurus and Neiisticurus, do not occur here. 



I believe it necessary to make some observations on the distribu- 

 tion of the Lacertilians. Our list contains 24 species of which 2 

 (Centropyx and Prionodactylus) as hitherto known only from Sao 

 Paulo, may be left out of the discussion. Three of these species: — 

 Tnjiinambis teguixin, Ophiodes striatus, Amphubcena vermicularis, 

 with var. darwini are of very broad distribution, extending from 

 north to south Brazil and to Paraguay ; eight of the species also occur 

 in Rio Grande do Sul including Enyalius calenatus with its varieties, 

 and Anisolepis grilli with its southern representative A. undulaiiis. 

 The genera Enyallus, Anisolepis, Urostrophns and Pantodactylas 

 represented in Rio Grande do Sul as well as in Sao Paulo, are not 

 known at this time from Paraguay. It seems to be the same with 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 105 



Hemidactybis, Mabxiia* and the species of P/aco-sowm, ffeterodactyliis,. 

 etc. 



As future studies may niodifv these results it i< sufficient here 

 merely to touch on the j)roblems of distrihution. In general we 

 have besides the more widely distiibuted forms to distinguish (1) 

 forms of the littoral of Brazil, and (2) forms of the Paraguay valley^ 

 extending to Brazil. 



I have already mentioned the former grouj). We can subdivide 

 it into species developed princij)ally to the north or to the soutli of 

 the tropic of Capricorn. Paiitodactylus schreibersi has not hitherto 

 been found north of Sao Paulo; Diplnrjlo^xvs fasciaivs is a Bahia 

 form, which I have received from Kio Janeiro and Santos. There 

 are many other species not represented in tiie interior of Sao Paulo, 

 whicli extend in the coast end of Santos and further southward. 

 Santos is situated on the ocean, S. Paulo 40 miles higher; the 

 annual temperature of Santos, Iguape, being 21,5°, of S. Paulo 18,3° 

 centigrade. 



Thus it is quite natural that in the lowland between the oceair 

 and the coast range, the Bahia fauna extends much farther south 

 than in the interior. It seems probable tliat Aiiiphislxnia al/xi, P/aco- 

 soma cordyliiium, etc. are governed by the same condition, and this 

 will be much more evident from thenumcnuis north Brazilian tvpes 

 represented in our collections Ironi Santos and Kai/ da Serra. But 

 I can refer to another instructive instance: One of the character- 

 istic families of the subtropical zone i.s that of the liokUc, represented 

 in Bahia by four species of which only Epicrates cenchris does not 

 seem to reach Kio. Knnecfes muriuux is common in the interior of 

 S. Paulo and extends to the south of St. Catharina as I have ex- 

 amined a skin from Laguna. It is gradually disappearing, and was- 

 once represented also in Kio (Jrande do Sul, as I believe Jloa con- 

 dridor, not rare in the interior of Sao Paulo, does not occur in Kio 

 Gran<le do Sul. I very nuich doid)t the record " Buenos Ayres" in 

 Boiilenger's Catalogue. Species of Iton and Kiiuictin also occur in 

 Paraguay but they are perhaps not exactly determined, and niav 

 be mere varieties of the eastern 8|)ecies. 



I have received specimens of Carollns ruiiinus L. iVom \i\ii and 

 from Santos.

 but iia.s nut hitlierto been found in Kio < irande. 




106 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



Anotlier fact on which I insist is the distribution of certain forms 

 from northern lirazil to tlie J^a Plata Kivcr, with the exclusion of 

 the Brazilian littoral. The genus Boa is an example of thi^. Ameiva 

 surinamensis does not exist in Rio Grande do iSnl, but is said to live 

 in the La Plata region, also in Bahia and in Para«;uay. In Sao 

 Paulo, however, this species is rare, and represented in the western 

 zone only. Here we have also Tupihambis rnfescens, extending from 

 Mendoza to western Sao Paulo and Mabuia frenata, a Paraguayan 

 species, which we have received from St. Rita and Paracicaba. 



The species of Mabuia have an interesting distribution. As we 

 mentioned above, the Paraguayan species M. frenata exists in the 

 western parts of Sao Paulo. From Santos I have M. acfi/is Raddi, 

 known hitherto only from Rio and north of Rio, but on the central 

 highland we have M. dorsivittata Cope, extending from Rio Grande 

 do Sul to Paraguay and to Sao Paulo. Tropidurus torquains and 

 Polychrus acidirostris are Brazilian species, distributed from Bahia 

 to Sao Paulo and extending to Paraguay. It should be possible by 

 this time, to determine analytically the various regional compo- 

 nents of the diverse faunas. 



I have elsewhere discussed these problems in distribution, having 

 been the first to direct attention to them. In a paper on the distri- 

 bution of Ampullaria I have mentioned, that of the species common 

 to the Amazonian and San Francisco region, A.canaliculata does not 

 occur in St. Catharina,.4. sordida being substituted for it. Also at 

 Rio Janeiro and in Sao Paulo there are other species of .^?/ijo»Z/aria. 

 This is only one example from a great list of species. Glabaris 

 riograndeiisii, etc. are not represented in the River Parana system, 

 but are common in Rio Grande do Sul. Besides the species common 

 to the Parana system and to Rio Grande do Sul, there are others 

 which reached Rio Grande and the La Plata States by the Paraguay 

 system. This is now separated from the Amazonian system, but the 

 fauiial identity demonstrates this separation to be of very recent 

 date. 



The distribution of neither the fresh-water nor of the land faunas 

 of Brazil can be at all understood without reference to these facts. 

 For instance there is Bnlhnus (Borus) oblongus Miill., a form 

 common in Rio Grande do Sul and the La Plata region, but also in 

 Bolivia, Guiana and Venezuela. From St. Catharina to Sao Paulo 

 and Rio where this species does not occur, B. ovatns Miill. is sub- 

 stituted for it, and north of Rio B. cantagallanus Rang takes its 




1898.] NATIRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 107 



place. From Sorocaba, Ypanema, etc. I have received B. ovatus, 

 but in Piraciciiba and St. Rita in the western zone we have B. 

 oblongus, which is evidently an immigrant from Paraguay, Bolivia, 

 etc. with many of our other Bulimus and Helix. 



The same conditions are noticed in other land shells. We find 

 identity of species from Bahia with those of the La Plata and Rio 

 Grande do Sul, which are absent from 8t. Catharina northward on 

 the littoral.^ 



I believe finally it is time for European naturalists to take notice of 

 these studies. It is quite an unscientific method, to continue to con- 

 sider the neotropical region as a natural unity zoologically. This 

 region in later secondary and early tertiary time was formed by 

 coalescence of an Antarctic and a troj»icMl element, the latter having 

 been in mesozoic time connected with Africa. It was only with 

 the pliocene period* a connection with North and Central America 

 was formed. The ancient West Indian bridge being only during 

 pleistocene time re[)laced by the present Isthmus of Panama. 



We kr:ow to-day the history of the South American mammals, 

 being able to separate the ancient endemic element from the pliocene

imniiirrants. In lierpetology this is not the case, nor may we expect 

 fossil material so abundant. Here zoogeojjrajihical data may lielp. 

 Thns, I believe, no one could understand the geographical distri- 

 bution of Ilyla without supposing it a i)]iocene immigrant to 

 Brazil from tiie north. We may be sure that Hyla or its allied 

 forms will never be found in South America in the older tertiary 

 formation. Taking Hyla as a northern intrusive element which 

 ])assed by way of Central America to the Amazonian region and 

 southward, we may easily understand the complete absence of these 

 tree frogs from the Chilian forests. The Andean barrier of Chili 

 and Peru is a very old one, and that of Ecuador a very recent one. 

 This explains the fact hitherto not observed, that the Cordilleras 

 are a zoological dividing line in Chile and Peru, but not in Ecuador. 

 It seems to me quite probable that the American Teiidcp, and Igiian- 

 idee are originally from South America, and the SolenoglyphcB, 

 Boidce, etc. from North America. 



It is not my intention to fully discuss these questions here; I 

 would only call attention to them as new problems which we have 

 to solve.

OBSERVATIONS ON ERRANT FRUSTULES OF EUNOTIA MAJOR. 

 BY T. CIIALKLFA' PALMER. 



The diatom Eunotia major Rab. occurs in some abundance in the 

 uplands of Delaware Co., Pa., though a])i)earing to flourish only in 

 the basins of such springs as are well-sliaded at all seasons. In these 

 springs it is often present in profusion, forming masses of clean, 

 brownish filaments attached to the sides of the pools, and by prefer- 

 ence to submerged wood. The filaments grow to a length of ten 

 centimeters, and vary in breadth from 0.036 mm. to 0.200 mm. 

 in accordance with the length of their constituent cells. These fila- 

 ments intertangle in such manner as to aflTord cover for numerous 

 protozoa, and for such diatoms as Surirella, Nitzxchia, Plnnnlaria 

 and Navicala. Eiuiotia lunurisGmB. also frequently occurs in pro- 

 fusion in the same company. 



In making a gathering of the filaments for study, it is well to be- 

 gin by washing them free from all loosely adherent matters, such as 

 sand, mica and clayey flocculence. They are then placed in a clean 

 bottle which has been filled with water from the spring. A short 

 exposure to diffused daylight will cause the diatoms to ri.«e to the 

 top, buoyed up by a multitude of oxygen bubbles entangled among 

 them, and to free themselves from a further portion of mineral mat- 

 ter, which will at once subside, and may be rejected by decantation. 



An examination of the gathering under the microscope will usu- 

 ally reveal, besides the filaments, a certain number of frustules, 

 either isolated or in groups of two or three, moving about in a slow 

 and erratic manner. In the course of two or three days, if all goes 

 well, the proportion of moving cells will have increased; and from 

 day to day, conditions pern)itting, the long filaments will progres- 

 sively separate, until frequently the whole gathering ends by resolv- 

 ing itself entirely into isolated cells and short sections composed of 

 two, four or even six cells, all in a state of lively locomotion. 



Conditions favoring production of errant frustules. — The prime 

 requisite for any extended study of the gathering is the preserva- 

 tion of the diatoms in a healthy condition. The best results have 

 followed with Eunotia major when the clean filaments were kept in a 




1898.] NATURAL t^CIKNXES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



semi-dark room, in a narrow-necked bottle filled with water from 

 the native spring. Evaporation is slow and distilled water only is 

 to be used in compensation. Any addition of town water is apt to 

 be followed by a sudden and enormous increase of bacteria and a 

 rapid decay of the diatoms. Bacteria do, in any case, gradually 

 invade the culture and ultimately destroy it; but, with the al»ove 

 very simple precautions, it is quite jtossible to keep the gathering in 

 good condition for a month — long enough to observe a variety of 

 changes. 



Free access of oxygen promotes the production of the motile frus- 

 tules. Two approximately equal quantities of healthy filaments were 

 selected, one of which was placed in a little vial with a narrow neck, 

 the other in a flat glass dish ; and, other conditions, as ten)perature, 

 light and amount of water, being identical, at the end of a week the 

 filaments in the dish had entirely disappeared, and the glass was 

 found to be coated with single cells and small motile segments of the 

 original filaments, while the bulk of those in the vial remained un- 

 separatfd. 



A secoixl experiment was as follows : — Two quantities of the un- 

 separated filaments, as nearly etpial as may be, were put into j)re- 

 cisely similar bottles. The first was at once placed in a dark corner 

 of a poorly lighted room, the second beside it, after having been ex- 

 posed to bright davlight until a mass of oxygen bubbles had lormed. 

 In the course <jf twenty-fijiir hours, during nine of which all light 

 was absent, the exposed bottle contained quantities of active motile 

 cells, while tin; other aflorded only a very few. This experiment, 

 twice repeated with the same result, taken in connection with that 

 which precedes, would indicate that we have here to do witli a pro- 

 cess the reverse of tlu' eiidotlurniic chlorophyl reaction: — 



CO, : II, () CTI,() ,() 



and that the chemical side of the plieriomenon is that which accom- 

 panies protoplasmic motile activity in general. 



This conclusion is reenforced by the observed fact that filaments 

 of Eiinotia in proccj-s of separation, and the resultant motile cells, 

 give n strong carbon dioxide color-reaction in thoroughly aerated 

 water tinted with hainatoxylin ; it is in accord with the important 

 observation ofO. Muller' as to thestimulating action of oxygen upon ^ 

 P'mnularia ; and, finally, it is diametrically opposed to that view of 



' Herichte der Deutscli. Hotan. Geseilsch.. IM. XI, \>. "A.

the nature of diatom inoveineiits held hy tlie proponents of the "os- 

 motic hypothesis," especially a^J this is set forth quite recently hy 

 W. M. Kozlowski.' 



The stimulating action of light upon the motile activity of the 

 errant frustules of Etinniiu is not to l)e douhted, and has been ob- 

 served a number of times; but. up to the present, notwithstanding 

 that I have paid some attention to the matter, the phenomena ob- 

 served are not sucli as are incapable of classification under the iiead 

 of oxygen stimulation. No fact whatever has clearly indicated any 

 special tendency to motion in the direction of greatest illumination, 

 and after observing, under various conditions, the movements of 

 thousands of these frustules, I have strong d(nibt as to the existence 

 of any such tendency in Eunotia. 



Characteridics of movement.'^. — Students of diatom movements 

 have, almost without excei)tion, confined themselves to Phnntlaria 

 and other naviculoid forms wherein the phenomena are most strik- 

 ing. H. L. Smith, ^ and, more recently, O. Biitschli* and K. Lauter- 

 born,* have been in practical agreement as to the phenomena, and to 

 a certain extent they agree in the conclusion that motion is the re- 

 sult of an expulsion of a more or less fluid filament from the central 

 nodule. O. Miiller,* agreeing with the others as to the phenomena, 

 looks rather, for their explanation, to currents of protoplasm which 

 circulate along the raphe within the coleoderm, entering into and 

 departing from the inner cell by way of the central and terminal 

 nodules. Hauptfleisch' has studied forms of Amphij)rora and Bre- 

 bii<iionia; and by staining methods has apparently demonstrated in 

 these the existence of a protoplasmic canal penetrating the raphe, 

 through the delicate walls of which protrude exceedingly fine threads 

 of protoplasm which act like similar organs in the rhizopods. 



' Botanical Gazette, Vol. XXIV, p. .39. Kozlowski presents in an ingenious 

 manner considerations su[)posed to point to the conchision tliat in I'mnalaria 

 motion is due to unefitial pliotosyntax in the two ends of the fnistiile, causing 

 stronger inward currents of assimilable li(jnid and ga-s in one or tlie other 

 end, this ditlierence depending upon the unecjual illumination of the twoends.

Little attention having been paid to the slower movements of 

 forms outside the Kaphidieae, it is not unusual to meet with state- 

 ments implying that definite and positive motion, requiring expla- 

 nation, is not observable in the case of these forms. This is a curi- 

 ous error. Splendid exhil)itions of motile activity have long been 

 familiar in the case of various s[)ecies of Xitzschia, and the exceed- 

 ingly striking movements of Bacillaria paradoxu are known to ob- 

 servers the world over. Certain species of i)«a<o?na and Fragilaria 

 exhibit motile phenomena of no doubtful kind ; and of Emiotla 

 major, which may stand as a type of the Fragilariea-, the follow- 

 ing are the observed facts : — 



NVhen a drop of water containing errant frustules is observed 

 under an enlargement of al)out 2<)0 diameters, the first movement 

 detected will probal)ly be that illustrated in fig. 2, PI. VI. Certain 

 frustules rise slowly on their ends, rotating smoothly through 180°, 

 and fall flat upon the slide. During this manoeuvre an end remains 

 in contact with the glass and serves as a hinge whereon the frustule 

 turns. Occasionally, but not often, a similar revolution is ac- 

 com{)lished at right-angles to this — in which case the long valve, 

 instead of the narrow end, functions as a hinge. This particular 

 moven)ent only occurs immediately after the deposition of the di- 

 atoms upon the slide, unless at this time the cells are not in a state 

 of activity, in which case it may be somewhat delayed. A long 

 series of observations, extending over three years, has shown both 

 the conditions under which this odd movement occurs, and the 

 manifold purpose of it. It is, fir.st, significant that only those ccIIh 

 that have chanced to fall upon the slide with ventral or concave 

 girrlb; nppcnno^t. :is in A, fi;r. 2, I'hitf VI perform this movement. 

 Such as have been deposite<| with ventral side down, as in (', l)egin 

 without delay to move endwise in the direction indicated in the figure. 

 Careful focussing hIkiws tliat in most cases the frustule is, during 

 this forward niovemetit, tilted a trifle, so that while the anterior end 

 remains in contact with the glass, the posterior eml is free from it. 

 This position is uiidoul)tedly a condition precedent to successful 

 locomotion, and there is no doubt that the attaining of this position 

 is the f)urpose of the rotation. That the anterior end is in contact 

 with the slide will be proven conclusively as we proceed ; and it is, 

 therefore, to the end of the frustule, and more especially to the 

 ventral side of the rounded end, that search must be directed for 

 tlie niechanism of this diatom's movement. 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [1898. 



The forward movement of Ennotia resembles very little the 

 smooth gliding of Pinnularia and Nitzschia. If these seem to swim, 

 the other would appear to crawl. One corner is advanced a trifle, 

 then the other corner, then both move forward at once. Occasion- 

 ally the frustule will sidle for a moment; but generally the pro- 

 gression consists of a succession of impulsive jerk.s. The movement 

 is accompanied by indications of very considerable stress. Compar- 

 atively large bodies, such as short filaments of EunoHa or small 

 particles of sand, are pushed resolutely aside. Larger bodies, espe- 

 cially such as have considerable thickness, arrest the frustule for a 

 time; but after a short interval, it is apt to turn upon its edge, with 

 ventral girdle in contact with the obstruction, to move past in this 

 position, and once more to resume its normal relations with the 

 slide. At the moment of the passage of the anterior, and sometimes 

 the posterior end of the frustule, the obstruction may be seen to 

 move backward, as if from an impulse resembling a kick. These 

 curious features I have observed numberless times. 



If by chance the moving cell pass, as in fig. 1, PI. VI, with a 

 corner over the circumference of a thin piece of mica, the latter is, 

 in n)any cases, caused to revolve backward in the direction indicated 

 in the figure. This also was seen so often that the existence of some- 

 thing resembling pseudopodia at the corners of the frustule came to 

 be anticipated with confidence. 



Many species of motile diatoms, among them Pinnularia and Nit- 

 zschia, exhWnt a sort of pendulum movement. The frustule proceeds 

 in a straight line a certain time, comes to rest, and returns upon its 

 path without changing the direction of its longer axis. This swing 

 to and fro is repeated any number of times, so that anterior and pos- 

 terior ends continually change places. There is little of this in the 

 movement of Eunoiia. I have frequently followed a frustule for 

 half an hour without seeing it return upon its path, and on one oc- 

 casion I observed a particularly active individual for two and a half 

 hours, ill which period its devious way was into all portions of the 

 hollowed slide, and in all that time it kept one and the same end 

 foremost. Yet there seems to be no universal neces.-ity for this 

 habit, since frustules are frequently observed to exhibit propulsive 

 eflRjrts upon solid bodies from both ends, and occasionally they do 

 reverse their direction. 



Movements in the luinging drop. — In order to study somewhat 

 further the relations between moving Eunotia and the glass of the 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



support, drops of water containing many frustules were suspended on 

 cover-glasses and observed. The diatoms were found to separate into 

 two portions. The first remained attached to the glass ; such of 

 them as had their dorsal or convex girdles next the glass performed 

 the revolution before described ; and these, with the others in con- 

 tact with the cover, proceeded in cliaracteristic ways, with the curi- 

 ous and .significant difference, that as viewed from above the ventral 

 side was now uppermost. The second portion fell to the surface of 

 the suspended drop, where they moved as if upon a solid substratum. 

 Midway of the drop there were none. Undoui)tedly the surface of 

 the drop possessed sufficient tension fur the purposes of a crawling 

 diatom. I have seen, in an aquarium, small snails crawling freely 

 along tiie i)lane of contact between water and air, with broad, flat 

 foot upj)ermost, applied to the surface of the liquid as if to a j)iece 

 of glass. 



Plwnomena in carbon eninlsion. — All preceding observations seem- 

 ing to point to the existence of invisible organs functioning as pseu- 

 dopodia, the endeavor was made to outline these by the well-known 

 method of putting the diatoms in an emulsion of colored particles 

 finely divided. To this end, since available India ink was found to 

 be toxic owing to its content of camphor, a portion of carbon-black 

 water-color was rubbed up in a drop of water until a very dark color 

 was obtained. The cmul-ion showed, under medium powers, a nml- 

 titude of particles exhibiting the lirownian movement. When placed 

 in this, the crvixut Uunotia cells revealed quite clearly the existence 

 at the (•()rners of rounded ma.sses of colcoderm. These were espe- 

 cially clear at the anterior corner.'^. 'I'hc particles of carbon ajj- 

 proached the frustules quite closely everywhere except about the 

 Corn»'rs, and a little U-shaped line, coinpo.sed of somewhat compacted 

 particles, jjreceded the moving diatom. There was nowhere t)bserva- 

 ble any streaming away of tiie particles, such as lliat seen by II. 

 L. Smith and others in I'hiindnrin. Owing to the tenacity of the 

 emulsion, and partly perhaps to the relatively raised position of the 

 posterior end of tiie frustule. the clear spaces are les.s eviilent at the 

 posterior corners. 



Jiesnllji of stain nKj. — Numerous attempts were made with a va- 

 riety of stains to render the coleoderm visible, the presence of which 

 seemed to be s(j .strongly indicated. All efforts to slain the still 

 living coleoderm failed entirely. There was little lietier . success in 

 fixing with osmic acid and staining with methylene blue, methyl 




IIG lMM)Ci;KI)IN(i.S OF THE ACADEMY OT [1898. 



l)liie, fiichsin, otf., for the osmic acid seemed to produce, as it were, 

 a certain shrinking of the very delicate or;j;ans. A measure of suc- 

 cess followed the use of gentian violet followed hy tannic acid, both 

 in minute quantity. Hy this means the coleoderm was outlined; 

 and especially in tlie case of frustules that dad passed the period of 

 their activity, and were nearly (>r (juite dead, as shown hy their con- 

 tracted nucleus and bacteria-infested outline, the surface staining of 

 the gelatinous external layer was clear. An extreme case of this is 

 roughly shown in fig. 7, PI. VI. Here the contents of the inner cell 

 were apparently normal, with the exception of the nucleus, but the 

 coleoderm was quite flaccid, loosely adherent to the frustule, and 

 abnormally enlarged, as well as fringed with colonies of bacteria. 



The stain which most quickly and surely shows the healthy coleo- 

 derm, at the .same time instantly killing the diatom, is made as fol- 

 lows: — 05 gram of Bismarck brown and 1.0 gram tannic acid are 

 dissolved separately atid added to a liter of distilled water. The 

 solution remains perfectly clear, aiid is of a reddish-brown color. 

 Two or three drops of this are added to a drop of water, under the 

 cover glass, containing errant frustules oi' Eunotia. Almost before 

 a change of tint is visible in the thin layer f)f water under the mi- 

 croscope, motion ceases, and, at the same lime, at each corner of 

 the frustules appears a little rounded mass of substance, gelatinous 

 in appearance, and dotted with coppery or bronzy specks of most 

 minute size. The shape of these masses, and their relation to the 

 frustule^ are indicated in figures 4 and 5, PI. VI. The results of 

 somewhat heavier staining with the same mixture are shown photo- 

 graphically by Mr. F. J. Keeley in figures 4, 5, and 6, PI. VII. 



Pursuant to the further study of these coleoderm masses, a large 

 number of errant frustules were stained as follows : About two drops 

 of water, containing the diatoms, were put on a cover glass and 

 allowed some minutes to bring themselves into norn)al relations with 

 the glass. Three drops of the described stain solution were added 

 and staining was allowed to proceed half an hour. The excess of 

 color was then removed by careful washing, dipping the cover re- 

 peatedly into a cup of water with as little friction as possible. 

 Griibler's aqueous eosin, diluted with an equal quantity of water, 

 was now added and allowed to act half an hour to an hour. Finally, 

 the glass was washed and mounted in very weak formalin. The di- 

 atoms, under these circumstances, remain attached to the cover glass, 

 as a rule with ventral side uppermost, and with coleoderm processes 

 in the position best suited for .'rtudy. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 117 



Prepared in this manner, the isolated cells and short segments of 

 61anients present the appearance indicated by figures 3 to 5, PI. VI. 

 The gradual development of the foot-like organs from an intercellu- 

 lar plasm is shown in figure 3 ; and in figure 6 is shown the deteri- 

 oration of these organs, which takes the form of an overproduction 

 and liquefaction of gelatinous substance, and ends by graiiually 

 bringing to rest all the moving cells of a gathering, and entangling 

 them in masses and threads of jelly. During this degeneration 

 many of the cells die, but some survive with every ai)pearance of 

 health, though necessarily devoid of motion. 



In figures 8 and 9 is shown the appearance, under 1,000 diame- 

 ters, of the stained processes from the valve view and from the ven- 

 tral girdle view. The outer and larger process, mainly gelatinous, 

 shows a general mass slightly tinted only, outlined by more heavily 

 stained grains within the substance. These grains take tlie eo.-iu 

 as do the prot<jphvsmic granules of the inner cell. The smaller pro- 

 cess, which seems to be somewhat shrunken by the staining with 

 eosiu (compare figures 4, 5 and 6, PI. VII) are of a deep and nearly 

 uniform red, and are in close apparent contact with aggregations of 

 protoplasm within the frustule. 



The small and ap|)arently constant bead-like bodies around the 

 circumference of the curving gelatinous masses have no perceptible 

 threadlike connection with the more richly protojjlasmic ])rocesses 

 at the corners, and their significance is somewhat <l(»ubtfnl. Thev 

 probably have S(jme relation to a current of protoplasm which would 

 seem to issue from the cell and return to it. 



Structure of the (riiMule. — The exi.>-tence of a " pseuflo-nodnle " 

 on the ventral side of the valve, near the end, has long been known ; 

 l)ut that there is a rajilie at the en<l of the frustule has not, I i)e- 

 lieve, been stated. The ])lu>tographs in Plate \'II, which I owe to the 

 kindiie.ss of Mr. F, J. Keeley, show <*Iearly both the existcnre of 

 tlii.«j raphe and the presence, especially on the ventral girdle, of 

 several channels in the silica which .<^eem adapted to lead currents 

 to and trom thi.-< raphe and the pseudo nodule. 



The exact shape of the raphe it^^elf, and its extent, remain to be 

 determined: and indeed the proiilem presents difficulties, for the 

 po.-ition of the raphe on the end of the frustule would necessitate 

 sections for its study. 



When a very dilute acpieous sfjlution of i/ciitian violet is dropped 

 upon living and moving Eimotia viajur, and afterward washed ofl^,

certain deeply stained lines are seen in immediate contact witl) the 

 silica of tlie ventral surface, and running down from the pseudo- 

 nodule and the end nodule. These dark lines follow the course of 

 the channels in the silica shown l)y the photographs, and would be 

 explained l)y the existence of richly protoplasmic Huid. In a single 

 case one of these lines was seen to issue, to all appearance, through 

 the raphe and enter the coleoderm. 



The above results of observation and experiment would seem to 

 me to be conclusive proof that Eunotia major, and by inference 

 other nearly related species and genera of the Fragilariece, move 

 by the action of organs that may be called coleopodia. This con- 

 clusion, however, is far from touching the question of the means of 

 locomotion in Pinnularia and its allies, and I have endeavored to 

 indicate some of the differences of the phenomena to be explained 

 in the two cases. It may be added in this connection that while a 

 large Phinnlarin in rapid motion not infrequently gives evidence of 

 brisk internal currents such as O. Miiller has described, such cur- 

 rents have not been observed by me in moving Eunotia. Under 

 rather high powers one only sees, near the corners of the frustule, 

 in the vicinity of the raphe, a certain internal commotion among 

 the very small protoplasmic granules, a spasmodic movement back 

 and forth, a weaving about. This movement differs alike from the 

 streaming of cyclosis and the Brownian trembling, and it is trace- 

 able with difficulty, if at all, far from the corners. Nevertheless, 

 the channelling of the frustule is of a character to indicate the exist- 

 ence of currents, and further observation may yet reveal them.

A SMALL COLLECTION OF MAMMALS FROM NORTH- 

 EASTERN CHINA. 



BY SAMUEL N. KHOADS. 



These notes are based on a collection of seventeen mammals 

 brought to Philadelphia by Messrs. George and J. Edward Farnura, 

 the product of a hunting trip in the Chinese and ^longolian terri- 

 tories northeast of Pekin with Dr. A. Donald.son Smith during May, 

 June, July and August, 1897. By the generos'ty of these three 

 gentlemen the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia comes 

 into possession of the greater part of the collection, tlins adding 

 seven species new to its museum. An account of their trip is being 

 prepared for the Geographical Journal of London. 

 1. Microtus (Microtus) mongolicus (l';ulile).' Monjjolian Vole. 



Seven specimens, Nos. 4,590 to 4,596, from along the shores of the 

 Sungari River in Mongolia north of Petun, come near M. arvalis 

 Pallas as defined by PoliakofF, Lataste and G. S. Miller, Jr. From 

 their greater size and resemblance to Radde's plate of monr/olicus^ 

 both as regards external and cranial characters, as well as from their 

 geographic position, it ap[)ears best to consider them as monr/olicus. 

 Externally the adult specimens resemble closely in size and color 

 very large IT. pennsylvanicus taken at the same season (July 16th) 

 in the vicinity of Philadelphia. The pelage of mongolicus, however, 

 is more thin and coarse, indicating a habitat in a hot climate. In 

 the skull of an old male specimen the interorbital ridges have 

 coalesced on the frontal suture in a sharp elevated median ridge. 

 Comparing it with M. pennsylvanicus of same age and sex their 

 greatest zygomatic width is about the same, but the length of the 

 mongolicus skull is about 4 millimeters greater and its interorbital 

 elevation above the alveolus of m. 1 is 2 mm. greater, showing a 

 relative length ami depth of cranium quite remarkable in the genus 

 and nowhere approached in any American species known to me. 

 The molar series are correspondingly long and narrow. It is a true 

 member of the subgenus Microtus as defined by Miller.' The hind

foot is 24 mm. from end of heel to end of claws; the tail 45 mm. 

 long, these dimensions being taken from the dry specimen. No 

 measurements for any of the specimens in the collection were recorded 

 by the collectors. 



2. Mu8 humiliatus M. Edwards. Pekin River K:it. 



All adult female, No. 4,598, from the steep banks of a stream at 

 Shiao Ho Tzu undoubtedly represents Milne Edwards' species de- 

 .scribeiP from the environs of Pekin, and with whose measurements 

 and plate it closely agrees. Edwards states that it represents Mus 

 ruttiis in China, an unaccountable statement, perhajis a slip of the 

 pen for Mna dettimnmis, as its external and cranial character.* are 

 very close to the short-eared, brown-backed, gray-bellied short-whisk- 

 ered Norway Rat. Its short tail and small cranium, however, easily 

 distingui.^h it from decinmuins. The skull of the specimen is 37.5 mm. 

 in occipit(j-na.*al length and 18.5 nim. in its greatest zygomatic ex- 

 panse. The nasals are relatively short, not reaching so near to the 

 8uj)erior termini of the j)remaxillaries as in deciimami.'? or radns. 

 The relations of this species to J/(/.'< cy/raco Pallas are seemingly close 

 and it /miy yet prove that humiliatus is only a subspecies of caraco. 



3. Mua -|>. 1 



TJie scalp and .-kull of an adult, long-whiskered, long-oared and 

 long-no.sed rat. No. 4,599, taken southeast of Dolonnor ai)parently 

 repre->ent a s[)ecies of slender and elegant proportions, with a skull 

 nearly as long as in the specimen of hinui/intn.s above recorded, but 

 with a greatly diminij-lied zygomatic width an<l cranial depth. 

 Thf^se characters and the great relative length of rostrum put it in 

 the Mit.'i ratlttJi gr(»up. Its cranium is much smaller and more slender 

 than ^f. rattus alexandrinns and the mandibles are unusually nar- 

 row and weak for a Mux. The uj)[)er head is yellowish-brown, 

 heavily lined with black, darke.'-t around eye.". Ears brown -trra v ; 

 lips white ; throat yellowish- white ; gray of cheeks broadly bordered 

 inferiorly by ochraceous buff which probably extended increasingly 

 along neck and sides of body. 



4. Alactaga annulata (M. Kdwnrd-). .'^iib'<p. ? Jcrbun, Kliin (iim. 



A young female Jerboa, No. 4,597, about two-thirds grown, from 

 all appearances should be classed under the above name. As would 

 be expected, its immaturily i.-* evinced by the darker pelage over the

entire upper parts as contrasted with M. P^dward's figure* of an adult 

 specimen. This dark coloration results from the hlack tij)s of the 

 upper pelage being more strongly developed and the l)ufl" ground 

 colors less intense than in the adult stage. The peculiar markings 

 of the tail fit M. Edward's figure so well that its specific affinity to 

 aunulatus is very probable. On the other hand our specimen was 

 not taken in the Mongolian desert but at an elevation of 3,550 feet 

 in a high fertile valley, on the border of the desert in the Khia Gan 

 ^lountains. It is probably a dark race of annulata, as yet un- 

 named.' 



6. Tamias lEutamiasi asiaticus (Gmclin). A^iatio Chii>u)unk. 



Two adult specimens. No. 4,601 from Tung Ching Tzu and No. 

 4,602 from Sian Lang Kou, the first taken in May, the latter in June, 

 both from the Province of Pechili along the foothills of the Khin 

 Gan Range south and east of Dolonnor, are of interest when com- 

 pared with American species of the subgenus Exdamias. Founded 

 in 1880 by Trouessart as a subgenus, Eutamias has lately been con- 

 sidered by Dr. Merriam® as of full generic value, with T. asiaticus 

 as its type, and including several species of West American chip- 

 munks of the toii'nsendi, speciosus and pictus groups. 



As contrasted with typical Tamias of Illiger, with our eastern 

 striatus as its type, Eutamias presents invariably a persistent second 

 upper premolar, never found in sfriatns and its east American con- 

 geners. Tliis feature is the only one given by Trouessart to char- 

 acterize Etitamias. and it is worthy of mention that in his recent 

 Catalogns Mammnliiim that author does not recognize his Eutamias 

 even as a subgenus. It is, however, worthy of that rank and no 

 more, as its generic recognition necessitates a like subdivision of 

 Spermophilwi into genera which, as such, are meaningless in nomen- 

 clature and only confuse where intended to elucidate the affinities of 

 distinct but closely related groups. 



The cranial characters of T. asiaticus do not seem to have been 

 made the basis of comparisons by any other writer than Trouessart 

 between the species of Tamias of the Old and New World.

Dr. J. A. Allen makes no mention of them in his publications on 

 the subject. The skulls of the two adult specimens secured by the 

 Messrs. Farnum present several characters of interest. First, as to 

 their subgeneric status, it is noteworthy that asiaticus not only has 

 the well developed and persistent second premolar found in our west 

 American species but also exhibits 6 to 8 strongly developed sulci 

 on tlie pigmented face of the upper incisors, analogous to those often 

 exhibited by Arctomys from the Cascade Mountains. An examina- 

 tion of several of our C'ascade Mountain, .Sierra Madre and British 

 Columbia species of Exitamia.-< exhibits the same character, and in 

 some species, as T. men'iiimi, T. quadrivittatus and T. town.'<endi it \b 

 very marked. T. striatm and its allies of the subgenus Tamiashave 

 normally smooth incisors as in Spennophilus and its subgenera Am- 

 mospermophilus and Callospermophiliis. Dr. Allen's final separa- 

 tion of all American species of Tamia.'< from T. asiaticus'^ was based 

 solely on an examination of the cr^^rnfi/ characters of Siberian spec- 

 imens, considered in connection with the wide geographic separation 

 of the habitats of the most boreal forms known in Eastern Asia and 

 Western America. An English maminalogist of great note has 

 taken occasion to deplore Dr. Allen's change of arrangement of 

 American s|)ecies as an illustration <jf the species-si)littiiig which 

 characterizes present day methods of American mammalogists. Had 

 our critic been at the pain?' to iiKjiiire into the subject i)y personal 

 examination of specimens he would certainly have avoided choosing 

 such an illustration ; for the specific differences between T. wtiaticuB 

 and its nearest ally in America are, in respect of the cranium, very 

 marked. The skull of nxintirus is much larger than that of the 

 largest American Eutainian. It is also relatively much wider than 

 the skull of any American sjjccies of the genus Tdinin.i nud the great 

 width of the nasal bones contrasted with tlicir Hhortness imme<iiately 

 separates asiaticus from any other TamioA. There is a distinct supra- 

 orbital proces-s or spine in nxiaticax cau.sed by the more jxtsterior 

 reach of the normal supraorbital notch found in all other species of 

 the genus. The skull of No. 4,002 is 40.5 mm. long; its greatest 

 width 22.5 mm. ; nasal length, 12.8 mm. ; posterior breadth of na.sals, 

 5 mm.; interorbital constri<;tion 10.2 mm. Unfortunately no 

 measurements of the Mongolian specimens were taken before skin- 

 ning. The hind foot, measured dry, is .'58 mm. in one specimen and 

 40 mn). in the other, indicating a species larger than utriatiis.

6. LepUS .•'{>. lliirr. 



A bare, No. 4,600, whose characters indicate a near approach to 

 maturity, evidently belongs to a species about the size of Lcpus 

 ameru'(unis. It was taken on the east slope of the Kliin Gun Mts., 

 in Mongolia, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet. It is much smaller 

 than any hare described from this region by Radde, Schrenck,^ 

 Pallas and others, the hind foot measuring only 105 mm. in length. 

 The tail and ears are relatively long, the former black above and 

 white below. The ears are blackish-gray and ochraceous, like upper 

 head and body, and bordered at tips with black. The belly, breaat, 

 vent and chin are pure white to bases of hairs; the lowerneck, fore 

 legs, and space between shoulders are tawny ochraceous. TheskuU 

 characters show close affinity to Lepiis americanus. It was taken 

 Julv loth, and is in full summer pelage. 



7. Gazella gutturosa mongolica (Ilciult). Mongolian Gazelle. 



An adult male and a yearling of the same sex, of the " Imperial 

 Sheep " or " Houang Yangtze " are represented by two heads in the 

 collection. On the supposition that Heude's species mongolica'' 

 is separable from the Siberian ^uf<?<rosa of Pallas, I adopt the above 

 trinomial. Its separability from what Heude figures as hillieriana 

 on the next plate I am inclined to doubt. In the yearling the horns 

 are about 3 inches long and curve inward, their points touching 

 and slightly overlapping above the occiput. The specimens were 

 taken in the Imperial Hunting Park northeast of Dolonnor. A 

 female of the same species, shot June 6th, contained a nearly mature 

 foetus. 



8. Capreolus pygargus (Pallas), .■'ubsp.? Monf;olian Koe Deer. 



The skull and scalp of a fine male specimen of this animal were 

 secured in the Imperial Hunting Park. It is placed in the above 

 category on the authority of Sir V. Brooke** who considers the Man* 

 churian Roe to be at least a small race of pygargus. 



It is remarkable that this specimen, shot in the middle of June, is 

 possessed of a fine set of antlers from which the velvet has not wholly 

 disappeared around the bur. 



9. Lynx isabellinus (Blyth). Thibetan Lynx. 



A fine adult specimen of Lynx, No. 4,603, also taken in the Im- 

 perial Hunting Park, agrees with Blyth's description of isabellinus 



'Mem. Hist. Nat. Chinois., 1894, p. 245. PI. XXXVIT.

a3 compared with the characters of tlie L. lynx (L.) of Europe. I 

 am uniible to state an opinion as to the specific value of isabellinus 

 but the fact of specific identity among the several forms of Lynx 

 rufus found across the northern continent of America, and their 

 close resemblance to L. lynx of Eurasia, suggests that Uabellinus is 

 only an eastern race of that species, characterized by fewer and 

 weaker spots, more naked foot pads and paler color. The specimen 

 was killed June 17th.

NOTES ON ALASKAN WATEB BIBDS. 

 BY ALVIN SICAI.E. 



During the summer of 1896, it was the writer's privilege, in com- 

 pany with Norman B. Scofield, a fellow student at Stanford Uni- 

 versity, to make a trip into the Arctic Seas for the purpose of col- 

 lecting specimens of natural history for the Leland Stanford Junior 

 University of California. 



The expedition was under the patronage of Mr. Timothy Hopkins 

 of Menlo Park, California, to whom great credit is due for the splen- 

 did scientific equipment to which the success of the expedition is 

 largely due. 



We desire also to express our appreciation of the favors extended 

 to us by the Pacific Steam Whaling Company of San Francisco, who 

 furnished free transportation for the expedition, and spared no pains 

 or expense to make our voyage pleasant as well as successful. Val- 

 uable aid was also given us by the commanders and officers of the 

 various whaling vessels of the above company. Special service was 

 rendered us by Captain Townsend of the bark "J. D. Peters," Cap- 

 tain Mason of the S. S. " Jeanie," Captain Cogau of the S. S. 

 " Thrasher," Captain Smith of the S. S. ''Narwhal," and also many 

 others. 



Our voyage extended north to Point Barrow, Alaska, tlienceeast 

 to the Mackenzie River. Collections were made at various points 

 along the coast.

 Rescue Station for a fine specimen, a male in full breeding ])lumage, 

 taken September 12th. Length 33.75 in.; bill along culmen 3.5; 

 along gape 5 ; height at nostrils 1.2 ; width .50 ; tarsus 3.7 ; wing

The great abundance of divers forms a striking feature of bird 

 life in Alaskan waters. The Red-throated Loon is one of the most

common forms. Large bands of this species were observed at Point 

 Barrow during the month of September. For the most part these 

 birds were making their way to the soiitli, usually flying high and 

 announcing their passage by hoarse, grating cries. 



In regard to this Loon, Nelson writes : " The Red-throated I^oon 

 is one of the very few birds whicii raises its voice in the quiet of the 

 long Arctic night. It is abundant at Point Barrow where it is sup- 

 posed to breed. It also breeds upon the Commander Islands."

12. Lunda cirrhata. Tufted Puftlii. 



A single individual of this species came flying past our vessel 

 May 27th, in longitude 12G° W., latitude 47° N. ; this was the first 

 specimen seen. It circled around us twice and was oflT again like a 

 shot. The following day three more were observed, and from this 

 time they became m(»re and more al)undant as we advanced to the 

 north until about June 16th, longitude 159° 50' W., latitude 51° 

 56' N. From this date and position there was a rapid decrease in 

 the number observed ; in fact. Tufted Puffins were not met witli in 

 any great abundance north of the Aleutian Islands, their place being 

 takf'U by the I turned Puffin ( Fnitercula cornicaluti). 



In their flight past our ves-sel these birds would usually circle 

 around us two or three times, turning their heads to one side and 

 looking down at us in a coini(;al and knowing manner, and in many 

 ways manifesting a high degree of curiosity. Seven adult speci- 

 mens of Jjiinila cirrhftln arc in the Stanford University collection, 

 four of which are from Nuteliuk, Alaska. July 5th ; tliree from the 

 Pribylofl' Islands. Hab., coa.nts^and islan»l.s of the North Pacific, 

 from southern California to Alaska, and from Bering Strait to 

 Japan ; accidental in the Bay of Fumiy and Kennebec River. 



14. Fratercula corniculnta. il'>rne<l I'unin. 



We lirst observed Horned Puffins June 2(»tli in longitude 165° 

 53' W., latitude 51° 3(»' N. From this po-ition until we reached 

 Point Ho|)e north of Kot/fliuc Sound they were common. At 

 King's Island near Port (JIarence, Ala-^ka, thex- birds nest in great

ahiindiiiu'o ; this rookery was visited .Tiily 4tii. The nests for 

 the most part seemed to be quite high on the cliffs, and at this season 

 were occupied by the immature birds, many of which, were able to 

 fly. The discharge of a gun caused hundreds of the adult birds to 

 take wing and circle about us. In a very short time, however, they 

 settled upon the clitF again, crowding upon each other and keej)ing 

 up a curious guttural sound. This species is represented in the 

 Stanford University collection by five fine specimens in breeding 

 plunuige taken on the Pribyloff Islands July, 1896. A specimen 

 taken early in the season (June 14tb) has the head and neck a deep 

 glos.sy black so nearly like the coloring of the back that it was diffi- 

 cult to make out the usual sharp line of demarcation. Hab., coasts 

 and islands of the North Pacific, from British Columbia to the 

 Kurile Islands. " Abundant on all the shore line of Alaska south 

 of the Arctic circle" (Turner). 



17. Cyclorrhynclius psittaculus. I'uroqupt Auklct. 



One specimen of this species was shot at Point Barrow, September 

 12th. But few of these Auklets were seen. Three specimens were 

 taken on St. George Island, July 26th, by Messrs. Greely and 

 Snodgrass. Hab., coasts of the North Pacific from Sitka to the 

 Kurile Islands. 



18. Simorhynchus cristatellus. Crested Auklet. 



These were very abundant on the water near King's Island dur- 

 ing the early part of July. The natives brought large numbers of 

 these birds on board our vessel to barter. I noticed, however, that 

 they always removed the small crest of the bird l)efore disposing of 

 it. Whether they retained the crest as an object of ornamentation 

 or for some superstitious reason I was unable to learn. Three speci- 

 mens' from the Pribyloff Islands taken in July show an interesting 

 variation in the size of the sexes. Male: wing, 5i\ ins ; tarsus,lA; 

 middle toe and claw. Iff; exposed culmen, 1 5 ; depth of bill at 

 nostrils, 1% ; greatest width of bill at gape, is ; head, 111. Female:

 found this bird breeding in abundance on the Diomede Islands in 

 Bering Strait. They were not seen by us north of King's Island.

20. Simorhynclius pusillus. Leu.-t .\iiklet. 



From latitude about 60° north until we reached Bering Strait, 

 these little birds were quite coiumon, usually seen in pairs on the 

 water. They were very tame and our vessel would almost run them 

 down before they would dive or fly. A number were shot near 

 King's Island. Three specimens, one male and two females, were 

 taken at St. George Island July, 1897, by Messrs. Greely and 

 Snodgrass. The male bird of this species shows a very decided in- 

 crease in size over the female on the nieasurement of bill, tarsus and 

 wing. Hab., coasts of the North Pacific, from Japan and southern 

 Alaska to the Aleutian and Pril)ylotf Islands. Nelson found these 

 birds abundant on the Diomede Islands in Bering Strait. 



29. Cepphua columba. I'i-^enn Cuillcinot. 



With the exception of a few specimens seen near King's Island, 

 the Pigeon Guillemots were not observed until we entered the Arc- 

 tic Ocean. At Icy Cape they were common on the water August 

 4th, their bright red legs, white wirjg bars and black bill making 

 them quite conspicuous. Few were met north of this point. Hal)., 

 coast of the North Pacific, from southern California to Icy Cape, 

 Alaska, Aleutian Islands, Kamt-chatka, and northern JapaiL 



30. Uria troile californica. ralifoniiii .Murru. 



June Kith a solitary California Murrewas observed on the water, 

 longitude 150° W., latitude 51° 56' N. ; this was the first specimen 

 seen. Three days later eight more of this species were observed. 

 The.se bird.", like the Tufted Puffin, were very curious about our 

 vessel and would usually circle around ns a iiumi)er of times before 

 going on their way. One even flew through our rigging four times, 

 acting very much as if trying to alight on the yards. Murres were 

 again tnet with June '2()th, when a band of twenty-two pas^-ed us. 

 June 22d they were quite common in longilutle 164° 55' W., 

 latitude 52° 9' N. Hab.. Pacific coast of North America, south to 

 SontlK-rn C'alifMrnia. Nelson found ihi.-* bird abundant on Wrangel 

 anil Herald Islands. 



31. Uria lomvia arra. lVill:i:<' .Murn-. •• lev Duck." 



These birds were met with in great abundance after entering 

 Bering Sea. The sailors call this mnrre the " Ice Duck," and its 

 appearance in large numbers is regarded as an indication of a near- 

 ness to ice. And indeed in the present ca.se at lea.-t, this proved to 

 be true, for on the following day, June 27th, longitude 170° W., 




}30 PROCEEl)IN(iS OF THE ACADEMY OK [1898. 



latitude 60° 20' N., a large ice floe was encountered upon which 

 the.><e birds were very abundant ; in fact, niie inif^ht easily liave mis- 

 taken parts of the floe for a rookery. Not only were thev abun- 

 dant on the floe itself, but each detached block of ice seemed to have 

 its crew of" Ice Ducks." OS' St. Lawrence Island July 1st, murres 

 were far more abundant than any other species of bird. At East 

 Cape, Siberia, July 26th, these birds were quite common. They 

 were met with constantly on the American side as far north as Icy 

 Cape. From this point on, very few were seen ; none were observed 

 to the east of Point Barrow. This species is easily distinguished by 

 the strong heavy bill. Four specimens from Nulchuk, Alaska, have 

 the culmen measuring 2.26 ins., 2.1,2.2, respectively.' Hab., coasts 

 and islands of Bering sea and Aleutian chain, from Kadiak to Kamt- 

 schatka. Nelson found this bird abundant on Harold and Wran- 

 gel Islands. 



STERCORARIID^. 



36. Stercorarius pomarinus. Pomarine .Jaeger. 



Four of this species were seen June 20th, longitude 164° 56', lati- 

 tude 50° 56' N. They were common at I'ort Clarence during the 

 latter part of July. A fine male was taken at Icy Cape July 31st. 

 At no time, however, were the birds in question so abundant as 5. 

 loiif/lc/iudas. Hab., northern portions of the northern hemisphere, 

 along sea coasts and larger inland waters, breeding far northward 

 in America, south in winter to California, New Jersey and the 

 Great Lakes. 



37. Stercorarius parasiticus. Parasitic .Jaeger. 



Parasitic Jaegers were not al)undant at any time. One solitary 

 individual was seen June 28th in latitude 60° 40' N. ; two more 

 were observed the following day. On July 1st three Parasitic Jae- 

 gers were seen off" St. Lawrence Island One specimen was shot at 

 Port Clarence July 2."3d. These birds were fairly common at Icy 

 Cape. On August 3d at this place two fine adults, a male and 

 female in black plumage, were taken (see Nos. 3,564 and 3,566 L. 

 S. J. U.). Hab , northern portion of northern hemisphere, breed- 

 ing toward Arctic regions; south in winter to New York, southern 

 California, and even the coast of Brazil.

38. Sterocrarias longicaudus. LoDg-tailed Jucger. 



This species could be seeu at almost any time from July to Sep- 

 tember. They were abundant all along the coast from Icy Cape to 

 Herschel Island, N. W. T, They were abundant at Point Barrow 

 and seemed to be engaged chiefly in making life sorrowful for the 

 gulls. I noticed, however, that the big Glaucous Gull turned the 

 tables, and was frequently seen to chase the Jaegers. One adult 

 male was taken at Icy Cape, August 3d (No. 3,560 Stanford Uni- 

 versity). This specimen gives the following measurements: Wing, 

 13.0 ins. ; culmen, 1.27; cere, .75 ; tarsus, 1.75; mid-toe and claw, 

 1.65. Hab., northern parts of northern hemisphere, breeding in 

 Arctic regions, soutii in winter to California. 



LARID^. 

 40. Rissa tridactyla poUicaris. I'aiific Kiitiwake. 



Tliis beautiful bird was frequently observed in leering Sea as far 

 north as Icy Cape, Alaska. Like the genus Larua, they have the 

 habit of following the vessel and watching for any food that may 

 be thrown over the side. They were most abundant ofll" St. Law- 

 rence Island, July 1st. Two were shot at Icy Cape August 3d, 

 (see Nos. 3,563, 3,564 L.S.J. U.). Hab., coasts and i.slands of 

 Bering Sea nortii to Icy Cape. 



40a. Eissa brevirostris. Kol-leggol Kittiwiikc 



This s[)ecie8 was more abundant tliaii tlic j)receding, especially in 

 the vicinity of the Auiiainak Pa.ss. Two s|)ecimens taken on St. 

 George Ishuid July li6, 18'J7, give the following measurements: No. 

 3,530 Stanford University ; wing, 12.25 ins. ; en I men, 1.12 ; depth of

 42. LaruB glaucus. <ilaiic>iii< <iiill. 



The big Glaucous (iulls were first observed June 2i>th, Inlituile 

 61° 32' N. They were not common, however, until we reached 

 Port Clarence, Alaska. Unlike most (Julls, this species is extremely 

 suspicions and rarely come.s within gun shot of the vessel. We 

 found this (iull abundant from Port Clarence all along the Arctic 

 coast to Mackenzie Bay. A southern migration of ihc-e birds was 

 observed at Point Barrow, Ala.'*ka, September 15lli ; it was a cold

rainy day with a stioiic; wind blowing from the northwest. All the 

 day, hand after hand of tliese Gulls passed the point followinj,' the 

 coast line to the south ; in one of these hands I counted forty-eight 

 individuals, most of them adults. Ilah., coasts of Arctic seas; 

 south in winter to Long Island and Califi.rnia. 



44. Larus glaucescens. (!l!iiii'<iu>-\viii^('(l (iuli. 



The Cilaucou.<-winged Gulls were fairly common from the Aleu- 

 tian Islands to the Bering Strait. They were seen to associate freely 

 with the smaller Gulls, and at times would come quite near the ves- 

 sel, differing in this respect from the L. glaucus, which so far as we 

 could see did not associate much with the other species. 



Two specimens taken at Orca Station, S. W. Alaska, give the fol- 

 lowing measurements: No. 3,425 (L. S. J. U.) ; wing, 17 ; culmen, 

 2.56; depth of bill through angle, .84; depth of bill through nos- 

 trils, .80; tarsus, 2.86; mid-toe with claw, 3.20; tail, 7.18: No.

 claw, 3.28 ; tail, 7.3. Hab., coasts of the north Pacific and Bering 

 Sea, from Japan northwest, across through Aleutian chain, and south 

 in winter to California. 



51a. Lams argentatus smithsonianas. American Herring Gull. 



Ijirds ascribed to this species came flying about our vessel near 

 Unalaska and also near Aunamak Island. No specimens were 

 secured. Hab., whole of North America, south in winter to Cuba 

 and Lower California. 

 53. Laras oalifornicus. California Gull. 



No specimens were taken, but birds ascribed to this species were 

 met with quite frequently near Aunamak Pass. Hab., western 

 North America, chiefly in the interior, from Mexico to Alaska. 



55. Larus brachyrhynchus. .American Mew (Jull. 



Birds of this species were frequently observed along the Alaskan 

 coast as far north as Icy Cape, one specimen being shot at this place 

 July 30th. Hab., northwestern North America breeding far north ; 

 south in winter along the Pacific coast to Southern California. 



62. Xema sabinii. Sabine's GaW. 



These Gulls were first observed about ten miles off Icy Cape, 

 Alaska, where a company of five came flying over the ice and pa.ssed 

 our vessel. On August 8th these gulls were extremely abundant at 




1898.] NATURAL SCIKNCES OF PIIILADEI.I'llIA. 133 



Point Barrow, congregating in thousands along the shore to feed 

 upon small Coelenterates and Crustaceans that were washed up on 

 the sands. Wiien we again reached Point Barrow, September 8th, 

 these birds were in the height of their southern migration, and 

 bands composed of from fifty to one liundred individuals were con- 

 stantly passing, but this time paying little attention to the food that 

 was still abundant along the shore. Xema Gulls were not seen at 

 Herscbel Island until August 28th. The absence of immature 

 birds was a striking fact; almost all of these Gulls that we observed 

 were adults. Two young, however, were shot at Point Barrow Sep- 

 tember 12th. Hab., Pacific coast of North America from Monterey, 

 California, N. to Point Barrow, east. New York, Great Lakes, 

 (casually to Bermudas and Peru). 

 71. Bteraa paradisaea. Arctic Tern. 



The first representative of this species was seen June 6th, longi- 

 tude 141° \V., latitude 52° 37' N. The poor bird seemed to have 

 been battling with the storm for some time and to be completely 

 tired out; it alighted in our rigging and remained with us all day. 

 By June 20th Terns were very coujinon, and eight or ten could be 

 counted from the deck of the ves.sel at one time. Two specimens 

 were shot at Port Clarence, Alaska, July 8th. Terns were quite 

 abundant at Point Barrow Augu.st 12th and at Ilcrschel Island 

 August 27th. Ilab., circumpolar region.^, south in winter to Cali- 

 fornia. Another 8[)ecies of Tern suppo.-^ed to have been Sterna alen- 

 tka was observed quite frequently in the Bering Sea. We were un- 

 able to obtain a specimen however. 



DIOMEDEID^. 

 82. Diomedea albatrns. Short-tiiilc'l Al)iiitni''.x. 



The first Short-tailed Albatro.ss was ob.«erved May 2»jtli. about 

 eighteen miles (iff Cape Platlery. Two were .seen .lunc 1st in longi- 

 tude 134° Hi' W,, latitude .";1° G' N. ; the day following another was 

 observed. This completes the record of all seen during our entire 

 voyage. The.se bird.s, unlike the Black-footed Alhatro.'^s, do not fol- 

 low after a vessel. Ilab., North Pacific from California to Alaska. 

 81. Diomedea nipripes. I!lii<u f.Miii'd Albatro^i". " Ooonic." 



On May 27th, about one humlred miles northwest of Cape Flat- 

 tery, these birds of the open .sea wcr*- fir.-l -ighted. From that time 

 until June 21.«t they were always in evidence about our ves.sel. The 

 last " fioonie," however, deserted us when we cnme in sight of the

snowy mountains of the Aleutian Islands. These birds offer a never 

 failing source of interest and instruction to the ocean traveller when 

 the sails flap idly against the mast and the voyage stretches out to a 

 wearisome length. As a matter of curiosity I made it a point at a 

 certain time each day to count and note down the number of Black- 

 footed Albatrosses that could be seen from the deck of the vessel, 

 the position of our vessel and any peculiar hydrographic conditions. 

 I copy the resulting table from my note book.

From the above table it would seem that in this case, at least, the 

 Black-footed Albatross during the early n)onth of June i.s found 

 most abundant in latitudes between 50° and 52° north, and that 

 they are seen in greater numbers about a vessel on calm days. A 

 fine fepecimen of this species was taken May 11th by letting a 

 baited hook over the side of the vessel, the hook catching merely in

the horny part of the beak and dropping out when we got tlie bird 

 on deck. It was utterly helpless on deck, being unable to fly 

 unless from the water. This bird, after having his beak tied so as to 

 restrain his vicious tendency to bite, was given the freedom of the 

 vessel. 



On one or two occasions among the bird.s that followed clo.se to the 

 stern of our vessel I noticed specimens that were marked slightly 

 differently from the one taken. I suspect these belong to one of the 

 other species reported from the North Pacific, but as no specimens 

 could be taken, nothing was definitely established. Hab., North 

 Pacific. 



PROCELLARIID^. 

 86b. Fulmaras glacialis glupischa. Pacific Fulmar. 



A large Hock (jf dark-l)()died birds, in appearance very much like 

 Pacific Fulmars, was observed some distance from the ship June 

 20th, latitude about 51° N. A heavy fog closing in, however, pre- 

 vented us from getting a more satisfactory observation of the birds. 

 The next day Pacific Fulmars were frequently seen quite near the 

 vessel. On June 24th, great rafts of these birds were seen on the 

 water in the Aunamak Pa.ss ; among these were quite a number of 

 the white ones. Just after entering the Bering Sea we pa.ssed a 

 great flightof Pacific Fulnjarsall making their way to the westward 

 against a heavy gale of wind. They would fly a short distance, 

 then settle U[)on the water and re^it a momeMt,and then try it again. 

 They always arose facing the wind and also sat on the water in the 

 same {)Osition. The dark Pacific Fulmar was not seen north of 

 Bering Strait. When in the North Pacific on our return voyage, 

 September 2otli, a large number of these Fulmars, (" bousins " they 

 are called by the sailors), carae flyiug about our vessel in the man- 

 ner of the Black-footed Albatross, exco[)t that the I-'ulmars ticw 

 quite high, most of the time making a peculiar sliarj* cry. They 

 followed the .ship, circlingaround iind (ner us almost the entire day. 

 Ilab., North Pa<-ific to Mexico. 



860. Fulmarns glaoialis rodgersii. Rod^cr'K Fulmiir. 



A Rodger's Fulmar was shot June 29th latitude 61° 'V N. Very 

 few were seen, however, until we n-achod Fast Cape, Siberia, whore 

 they were common. On September 19th when aixiut wixty miles 

 west of Point Barrow, Rodger's Fulmars could be .seen almost any 

 time during the day following after our ve.s.scl, as if expcctini: food 




13G PROCEEDINCS OF THR ACADKMY OF [1898. 



to be thrown over to them. They hud ])r(th:ilily learned to expect 

 food from ships by being near the whaling vessels while thev were 

 " cutting in " or " trying out " a whale, at which time large quanti- 

 ties of fat and refuse are thrown over the side. Hab., Bering Sea, 

 Arctic Ocean north to Point Barrow. 



91. Puffinus creatopus. I'iiik-fodtcil Sliejirwnter. 



A great flight of Pink-footed Shearwaters was observed May 

 26th about fifteen miles off" Cape Flattery. They were passing to 

 the north in a continuous stream. I watched from the deck of our 

 vessel for over an hour, during which time many hundreds passed, 

 frequently flying quite near us. Their large size, white breasts and 

 wheeling flight were unmistakable. Our vessel interrupted their 

 line of flight, but they simply divided, part of the stream going by 

 on one side, and part on the other. Never for a moment did they 

 stop the steady flow to the north. The Pink-footed Shearwaters 

 were not met with again during our entire trip. Hab., Eastern 

 Pacific Ocean, Cape Flattery to Chili. 



95. Puffinus griseus. Dark-bodied Shearwater. 



A few Dark-bodied Shearwaters were observed May 26th off* 

 Cape Flattery. They were flying north in company with the PuJ- 

 finv^ creatopus. Dark-bodied Shearwaters were again observed 

 June 22d in longitude 164° 55' W., latitude 52° 9' N., about sixty 

 miles south of the Aleutian Islands. At this point we encountered 

 and for several hours sailed parallel to a great flight of these birds. 

 During this time thousands of individuals passed us in steady flight, 

 all going to the westward. 



Ooeanodroma (T). Petrels. 



Concerning Petrels I have the following entry in my note book : 

 June 16th, longitude 159° 58' W„ latitude 51° 56' N. For the 

 past two or three nights there has been a number of small bat-like 

 birds flying about our vessel keeping up an almost constant sound 

 of low musical notes. The sailors call them " Mother Carey's 

 Chickens," I was not able to secure a specimen for identification. 

 They may have been 0. furcata. 



Birds well answering the description of 0. furcata were observed 

 May 28th. They were flying about in the wake of our vessel, 

 skimming gracefully over the waves and occasionally dashing 

 through the spray as if they enjoyed the rough sea. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIKXCrs OF PHI I.ADEI.PHIA. 137 



PHALACROCORACID^. 



123a. Phalacrocorax. Cormorants. 



Prol)aby not more than two dozen Cormorants were seen during 

 our entire voyage. Xo specimens were ^;hot. Tliree .«niall individ- 

 uals uf this genus were seen on a small island in the Aunaniak Pass, 

 which is our first northern record for " Shags." These were a 

 small species (possibly P. p. robiidns). Seven Cormorants of a 

 larger species (possibly P. urile) were observed off Aunamak 

 Island. A few were also seen in the vicinity of Point Hope. All 

 the Cormorants met with .seemed extremely wild, keeping well out 

 of range of a shot gun. This is rather surpri.^ing when one consid- 

 ers how tame and fearless the Shags ure near Monterey, California, 

 where they are being shot at constantly. 



ANATID^. 

 154. Clangula hyemalis. Olil-siiuuw. 



Along the Arctic coast from Point Barrow eastward to the Mac- 

 kenzie River, the scarcity of bird-life as compared with that of 

 Bering Sea is quite striking. In fact, were we to disregard Old- 

 squaws, Glaucous Gulls, ami an occa.-^ional straggling band of Eider 

 Ducks, our records for this part of the voyiige would be chiefly a 

 blank. With the exception of Eider Duck.s, OId-s(piaws were the 

 most abundant water fowl met with in the Arctic. At Point Har- 

 row, September 12th, a great migration of Old-.squaws was going 

 on, thousands were passing to the south ; many were shot. Their 

 meat, however, is not considered good eating, except by the natives. 

 Hab., northern j)ortions of northern hemisphere, south in winter 

 nearly acros.s the United States. 



168. Arotonetta flsoheri. Sjiectiiclcd Kidcr. 



A young Spectacled Eider was taken about fifty miles off Icy

Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, made collections of Odonata 

 in the Aldabra (Lat. 9° 25' S., Long. 46° E.), and the Glorioao (Lat. 

 11° 40' S.,Long. 47° 33' E.), and the Seychelle Islands in the Indian 

 Ocean, and in Kashmir, which he sent to the U. 8. National 

 Museum. These, by the direction of the late Dr. C. V. Riley, were 

 sent to me for study. Their consideration is here grouped under two

No previously published records for the Odonata of the Aldabra 

 and Glorioso Islands ap[)ear to exist. Brief accounts of their recent 

 visits to the former are given by Mr. T. Risely Griffith and Dr. 

 Abbott in the Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information, Royal Gar- 

 dens, Kew, 1893, p. 152 et seq., but these contain nothing as regards 

 insects. A list of the plants collected by Dr. Abbott in the Aldabras

In the present paper seven species are mentioned. Five, from the 

 Seychelles, were already known to exist there, but some additional 

 details on their structure or relationsiiips are given. Two species 

 are from the Glorioso Islands, one from Aldabra.

 males, eight females, Aldabra Is. 



3. Tramea basilaris Beauvois.

 Svnonyra? Tramea Burmeisteri Klrhj, Trans. Zool. Soc London, xii, p. 316, 

 1889. 



One male, four females, Glorioso Is., the male and one female 

 dated Jan. 29, 1893. 



Mr. Kirby states (/. c.) that his Burmeisteri is " nearly allied to 

 the African T. basilaris Beauv., in which, however (judging from 

 the single broken specimen before me), the yellow area on the hind 

 wings is much less extended, and the opaque spaces (of which the 

 upper one is much more extended) is nearly black." 



In all these Glorioso individuals, the yellow area on the hind 

 wings extends from the base outward as far as the external angle 

 of the triangle ; in the male it reaches backward (caudad) to the 

 anal ' angle,' in the females back to three-fourths of the width of the 

 wing-base; as regards the extent of the yellow area, therefore, these 

 individuals have, in Mr. Kirby's view, a character of Bnrmeisteri 

 rather than of basilaris. 



On the other hand, the upper basal band of the hind wings of 

 Bunneisteri fills up " more or leas of the lower basal cell and part 

 of the wing below [the italics are mine] adjacent as far as the base 

 of the triangle" (Kirby, /. c). In these (Jlorioso females, btit not 

 in the male, the blackish-brown fills up the basilar [median of Selys, 

 1896] space (=up{)er ba.eal cell of Kirby), the subcostal space to 

 the first (1 9 ) or second r3 9 ) antecubital, and i)artH of the supra- 

 triangular .'*[)ace and of the triangle a.^ well as the " lower ba.«al cell 

 and part of the wing below iwijacent"; this distribution of the 

 dark color is a character of Inixilaris. In the (ilorioso male the 

 brown on the hind wing.s is reddish-brown and therefore paler than 

 in the females; it fills the " lower basal cell and part of the wing 

 below adjacent " and extend.^ into the triangle, and i.'^ separated from 

 a second, wider reddish-brown band extendint,' from the inner mar- 

 gin to the <listal sul)i)asal sector although not actually touching 

 either margin or sector ; this second band therefore does not "run 

 from the base of the sector of the triangle " as in Bumieijiteri. 




144 PROCEKDFWiS OF THi: ACADEMY Ol [1898. 



I have before me also two males from Madagascar, similar to the 

 one described above, sent to me by M. Martin as bnnilaris. 



Altogether 1 think that the probability is that basilaris and Bur- 

 tneisteri are color extremes of one and the same species. 



It may be recorded here that in these Glorioso individuals the 

 first pair of legs are blackish like the others, that the genital ham- 

 uleof the male projects beyond the genital lobe, that the inferior 

 appendage of the male is half as long as the superiors and reaches to 

 tlie last denticle thereof, the superiors being longer than 9 + 10 but 

 shorter than 8 + 9-j-lO, and that the vulvar lamina of the female is 

 three-fourths as long as 9, bilobed in its own ajtical three- fourths, 

 and her appendages as long as 9-f 10. 



This species has not been recorded from the Seychelles. 



4. Tramea continentalis Sdys. 



Selvs, Mitth. Dresdner Mus., iii, p. 299, 1878. Martin, Mem. Soc Zool. 

 France, 189G, p. 102. 



One male, one female, Mahe Is., Seychelles. 



The male is the same form so identified by M. Martin as he has 

 sent me one of his Seychelle specimens. The female is like those 

 he mentions in his last sentence (/. c.) "Certaines femelles n'out 

 meme qu'une petite tache marron tres courte, le long de la mera- 

 branule et le surplus de la tache normale est indiqu^ par une teinte 

 jaune brulc tres clair, presque limpide." A male in my collection 

 from West Madagascar by Hildebrandt, formerly in the Museum 

 fiir Naturkunde, Berlin, where it stood as T. limbata is of the same 

 species and Mr. Kirby's description of Tramea madagascarensis 

 (Trans. Zool. Soc, London, XII, p. 317, 1889) also applies here. 

 Unfortunately even M. Martin does not give a sufficiently full state- 

 ment of the distinctions between limbata Desjardins and continentalis 

 Selys, and it is not certain that the insect I have described as T. 

 limbata (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. xviii, p. 121 ; Ent. Nachr. xxii, p. 

 217, 1896) really is such. 



In these two continentalis — the male has ihe haraule jirojecting 

 considerably beyond the genital lobe, the superior appendages are 

 almost as long as 8-|-9-}-10, the inferior appendage is almost half as 

 long as the superiors and reaches slightly beyond their denticles ; 

 the female has the vulvar lan)ina seven-eighths as long as 9, bilobed 

 in its apical three-fourths, the appendages as long as 9+10.

With the more abun-

 that these differences 

 are not constant, but 

 vary individually. Even

 Two males, tliree females, "5—10,000 f" 

 Differs from 0. serpentinus Charp. as follows: 

 $ 9 . — No black mark or line on the suture between frons 

 and nasus, or on the nasus ; prothorax yellowish green, a transverse 



band between anterior and middle lobes 

 and either side of the posterior lobe 

 blackish ; the two median black bands 

 on the thoracic dorsum wanting ; the 

 narrow antehumeral black stripe iso- 

 lated, touching neither the anterior 

 raesothoracic border below nor the ante- 

 alar sinus above, or almost entirely 

 wanting in one female; no dark spot 

 behind the posterior legs ; the dorsal 

 yellow spot on 3-7 rounded, not pointed, 

 at its hind end, on 8-9 occupying almost 

 the entire length of the segment.

Selys, Ann. 8oc. Ent. France (2) i, p. 109, 1843. Ann. Soc. Ent. Belg.,

One male, " below 5,000 f.", agrees with bidentatus in its append- 

 ages (very nearly), in the number of cells (three) in the anal tri- 

 angle, and in those color differences which distinguish bidentatus 

 from insignis. It differs from bidentatus in having an apical infe- 

 rior yellow spot on abdominal segment 1, and a twin apical yellow 

 spot on the dorsum of 4-6, a yellow spot on each side of the apex of 

 7-9, and a basal yellow spot on each side of 10 ; all the yellow spots 

 on the abdomen are larger than in bidentatus. Abdomen 55 mm., 

 hind wing 46. The most eastern record for bidentatus hitherto ap- 

 pears to be Asia Minor.

Only in three of these, all females, does the black basal spot of 

 the hind wings extend into the triangle, and even in these three it 

 does not completely till the triangle. These females and one male 

 may be referred to the variety prenubila, although the brown cloud 

 below the pterostigma is in no case intense. One of these females is 

 also interesting in that it approaches basilinea McLach. (Ann. Mag. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



Nat. Hist. [6] xiii, p. 430, 1894), as on the front wings a dark-brown 

 streak occurs in the subniedian space from tlie cross-vein almost to 

 the distal end, and there is a small, separate brown spot in the same 

 space on the basal side of the same cross-vein ; in the subcostal space 

 of the same wings there are, between some of the antecubitals, small 

 pale brown spots in the midst of the yellow of the anterior margin. 

 This yellow extends to the pterostigma in all but two males. The 

 ventral abdominal S[)()ts of basilinea are not present. 



Recorded from Turkestan (Brauer), Persia and Yarkand (Selys).

Five males, nine females, " lielow 5,000 f."

9. Orthetrum brunneum Fonso. 



Five males, three females, "below 5000 f." ; two females " 5- 

 10,000 f." Not distingiii.^hable from European si)ecimeiis, with which 

 I have carefully compared them, and certainly different from gracile 

 (Albania) Selys and Ramburii Selys. One female has the discoidal 

 triangle of both hind wings crossed by f)ne vein, but I can find noth- 

 ing to indicate that it is of a different species.

One female, "below 5,000 f," is proi)ably this species, although it 

 is larger (total length 38 mm., abdomen 25, hind wing 29, alar 

 expanse 62), and the thorax is pale olive instead of reddish-brown, 

 which may not, however, indicate more than that this individual is 

 more immature.

only of one male and one female, the sectors of the triangle are a 

 little separated at their origin. 



Previously known from Turkestan (Selys). 



13. Sympetrum (or Diplax) vulgatum L. 



One male, " .5-10,000 f.", has the black longitudinal line on each 

 side of the third al)dominal segment, the basal line of the frons pro- 

 longed inferiorly in front of the eyes, hamules as described by Baron 

 de Selys (Ann. Soc. Ent. Belg., xxxi, p. 10). It is of the typical 

 form of vulijatam and not of the race decolorata Selys. 



14. Sympetrum (Diplax) Fonscolombii Selys. 



One male, two females " 5-10,000 f " ; one female " below 5,000 

 f." In the male, which is semi-adult, the yellow on the base of the 

 hind wings reaches out in the submedian space almost to the tri- 

 angle and more than halfway back toward the hind margin. In 

 the females the extent of this yellow is smaller and like that of 

 European examples. 



Previously known from Turkestan, and Murree in N. W. India. 

 Mr. C. C. Adams and Prof. M. J. P^lrod have sent me both sexes 

 from the plateau of the Nilgiris, 7,500 ft., taken in August and 

 September, 1896. 



15. Sympetrum (Diplax) meridionale Selys. 



One female, " below 5,000 f." There is a greater extension of 

 yellowish coloring over the bases of the wings than is usual in Euro- 

 pean individuals of this species, but the other characters agree. 

 Baron de Selys refers to this species a female from " les raontagnes 

 de I'Inde." (Ann. Soc. Ent. Belg., xxviii, p. 36, 1884).

In studying this material I have had to depend entirely on de-

 so that a few species have had to be set aside for the present. For 

 any error, therefore, that may occur in their identification, 1 wish to 

 beg kind indulgence. I also wish to express my sincere thanks to

THE MUSCID5: COLLECTED BY DR. A. DONALDSON SMITH IN SOMALI 



LAND. 



BY GARRY DK N. HOUGH, M. D. 



One cannot offer for publication a paper on Mu>ci(l:i' in wliich 

 species are described as new without a certain amount of misgiving. 

 So many descriptions of Muscida? have been j)ul)lished tliat I fear I 

 may have overlooked some, and that I may have added to the 

 already too long list of synonyms. I can only say that I have con- 

 scientiously tried to avoid this. My descriptions are long, but the 

 resemblances between the Muscidse are so close, that it is essential 

 to describe new species at length if they are ever to be recognized 

 by subsequent students. If any of the species described as new are 

 already known, I shall be very glad to be informed of it and to 

 j)ublish the synonymy. 



Considerable space has been given to the bristles of the head, 

 and, as I have felt obliged to introduce some new names, my de- 

 scriptions must be prefaced by a few remarks on these bristles. 



Bristles of the Head. — The central feature of the niuscid face is 

 the frontal suture, wliich, taken as a whole, has the shajie of an in- 

 verted U. the arms making with one another more or le.-s of an 

 angle. 



If we draw a line across the face tangent to the convexity of this 

 suture, then the part of the face dorsafl of this line and between the 

 eyes is the front. The front is distinctly divided into three parts, 

 a median ('the frontal ntfa), and two lateral (the grno rcrlical 

 plates). The boundary lines l)etween the vitta and the geno-verti- 

 cal plates are marked by rows f»f bristles Cusually one row on each 

 Bide of the vitta), which are inserted in a dorso-ventral line from a 

 point on a level with the anterior ocellus to the ventral border of 

 the front. These are the frontal brixtlcx. They are in two groups 

 which I call the ascending frontal and the trunsfrontal. The 

 ascending frontal, from one to four in number, are the most dorsad 

 of the frontal bristles. If more than one i.s present, the most dor- 

 sad is the largest, and each succeeding one is smaller (usually much 

 emaller) than its dorsal neighbor. They are curved dorsad, caudad 

 and more or less laterad, and are parallel to one another. 




166 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADKMY OF [1898. 



The trauj^-frontal vary in number in different species, in the two 

 sexes of the same species and even in different individuals of the 

 same sex. In the female they are directed niesad and cej)ha]ad 

 across the frontal vitta and more or less of them may decussate with 

 their fellows of the opposite side. In the male they are generally 

 more numerous than in the corresponding female, and they are 

 directed cephalad with (usually) a curve dorsad or ventrad. As 

 in the female they may decussate, but as a rule they do not. 



Each geno-vertical plate is continued over the vertex to the occi- 

 pital surface in the form of a little ridge. This ridge is bounded 

 laterad by a suture which begins at thedorso-mesal angle of the eye, 

 runs to the vertex, over the vertex to the occipital surface of the 

 head, and then in a ventro-mesal direction as far as the great cen- 

 tral foramen. About half way between the vertex and the great 

 foramen the little ridge bifurcates. The lateral branch continues 

 in al)out the same direction as the main ridge, while the niesal branch 

 runs more or less directly mesad and joins its fellow of the opposite 

 side ; thus by these two little ridges and their mesal branches a tri- 

 angular area is marked out at the dorso-central part of the occiput. 

 At tlie very beginning of each of these little ridges just mentioned, 

 right on the vertex, stands a bristle which is called the inner verti- 

 cal, and down a little way on each ridge just before it bifurcates 

 stands another which I propose to call the occipito-central. Both 

 of these bristles are present in every species that I have so far had 

 the opportunity of examining. They vary in size in different spe- 

 cies and in the two sexes of the same species. The inner vertical 

 project dorsad with more or less of a curve caudad and mesad, so 

 that they sometimes decussate a little and are almost always con- 

 vergent. The amount of convergence varies even in individuals of 

 the same species and sex. The occipito-central project dorsad and 

 mesad sometimes with a curve, sometimes without a curve, some- 

 times decussating a little with one another, sometimes apparently 

 decussating with a bristle called the post-vertical, which will be de- 

 scribed later. 



On the vertex, just laterad the beginning of the little ridge and 

 the inner vertical bristle, stands a bristle which is called the oxiter 

 vertical. This bristle varies much in size in different species and in 

 the two sexes of the same species. It is larger in the female than in 

 the male, and is absent in the males of some species although pres- 

 ent in their females. 




1898.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



A little caiuiad, ventrad and laterad of the outer vertical, on the 

 occipital surface of the head, there is sometimes a small bristle 

 which curves dorsad, niesad and a trifle cephalad, apparently decus- 

 sating with the outer vertical. I call this the occipito-lateral. 



Parallel to and at a variable distance caudad from the occipital 

 margin of the eye, is a row of bristles called the cilia of the posterior 

 orbit. They begin dorsad very near the outer vertical bristle but 

 distinctly caudad of it and also very near but cephalad of the occi- 

 pito-lateral. The members of the dorsal part of this row are com- 

 monly larger and more perfectly aligned than the members of the 

 members of the ventral portion, and there is much difference in their 

 size and correctness of alignment in different species as well as in 

 the distance to which they can be traced ventrad as a distinct row. 

 Frequently there are one or more rows of exceedingly small bristles 

 intercalated between the cilia of the posterior orbit and the occi- 

 pital margin of the eye. The jjosterior orbit is tlie space between 

 the cilia of the posterior orbit and the occipital margin of the eye ; 

 it is usually narrower in the male than in the fen):ile, and may be 

 absent. 



I spoke above of a triangular area marked out at the dorsocen- 

 tral part of the occipital surface of the liead by the tw(j little ridges 

 and their mesal branches. This triangle and the more or less dis- 

 tinct eminence on which the ocelli are situated, are continuous with 

 one another over the vertex and form a diHerentiated portion which 

 is occupied by a group of bristles which may be called the occllar 

 group. Among them we must distinguish the greater occllar (ocel- 

 lar pair of Baron Osten-Sacken), and the lesser ocellar. 



The greater ocellar is a pair of bristles usually easily distinguish- 

 able by their larger size, which are inserted between the anterior 

 and posterior f)colli. They vary in size, direction aiid curvature in 

 different Hj)e(ies anrl in the two sexes of the same species, and in 

 (liH'erent individuals (especially males) of the same species. They 

 are generally parallel to the lesser ocellar bristles and sometimes 

 differ from the latter in size by a very small amount. 



The lesser ocellar are more numerous, from three to twelve pairs, 

 and are usually in-serted in two parallel lines (sometimes in four) 

 which begin very close to the insertion of llie greater ocellar and 

 extend cauda<l a varial)le distance, sometimes ulxiut halfway to an 

 imaginary line joining the insertions of the inner vertical bristles, 

 sometimes beyond this line to the occipital surface of the head. 




1G8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898^ 



Usually the most caudal pair of lesser ocellar is somewhat larger 

 than the rest, sometimes much larger, and it has received the spe- 

 cial name post-vertical pair. When it is much larger and at the 

 same time is separated by quite a space from the next pair (as in 

 the females of Myospila, Maacina and Graphomyia) the post-verti- 

 cal really seem to be an independent pair of bristles, but when (as 

 in Musca and Morellia) they are hardly distinguishable in size, are 

 as near the next pair as that pair is to the next in the series, and 

 still more when we find similar bristles even caudad of the post- 

 verticals themselves it is clear that they belong to the lesser ocellar 

 series. 



In some species we can see, in tlie middle of the frontal vitta, a 

 more or less distinctly differentiated dorso-ventral stripe. The ven- 

 tral end of this stripe is not much above the ventral end of the 

 frontal vitta itself. Dorsad it broadens out and then divides into 

 two branches, one of which passes on each side of the ocellar emi- 

 nence to the vertex. Inserted on the vitta some little distance 

 below the anterior ocellus and close to this stripe (over which they 

 decussate) we find in some species a pair of rather small bristles 

 which I call the preocellar. 



Bristles which are inserted on the geno-vertical plate are called 

 orbital. 



On each side of the face at tlie ventral end of tlie arm of the 

 frontal suture, begins what is called the transverse imprexsion of the 

 face. This is at first a rather broad shallow depression. It passea 

 almost horizontally laterad (becoming narrower as it proceeds) ven- 

 trad of the eye, and can be readily traced as far as the ventro-cau- 

 dal angle of the eye where it usually seems to end. Sometimes, 

 however, it can be seen to be continuous with a suture of the occi- 

 put which runs from the latero-ventral angle of the great foramen 

 toward and sometimes to the ventro-caudal angle of the eye. 



That part of the side of the face which is dorsad the transverse 

 impression, laterad of the arm of the frontal suture and mesad 

 of the eye is called by the German authors the wange. For this, I 

 suggest the word gena, for reasons which will appear later. The 

 gena is continuous dorsad with the geno-vertical plate. 



Ventrad of the transverse impression and ventrad of the eye, ex- 

 tending ventrad to the edge of the mouth opening, cephalad to the 

 vibrissa! ridge, and continuing caudad on the occiput to the great 

 foramen, is the part which the German authors call the Backe> 

 For this I suggest the word bucca. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169 



In English we have l>ut one word " cheek " for the two German 

 words Wange and Backe. The AVange is dorsad of the Barke. In 

 Latin the word " gena " refers rather to the upper partof the cheek, 

 the word " bucca " to the lower part. For these reasons and be- 

 cause the words bucca and Backe are ^o nearly alike, it has seemed 

 to me wise to translate Wange by gena and Backe by Inicca. The 

 bucca is sometimes clearly defined, cephalad, from the vibrissal 

 ridge by a distinct steep edge (I have never been able to see a 

 suture here), at other times it is not so defined and the line of sepa- 

 ration is an imaginary one, more or less clearly indicated by dif- 

 ferences in the characters of the hairs and bristles of the bucca and 

 the vii)rissal ridge. That portion of the bucca which is on the occi- 

 pital surface is bounded by distinct sutures. The whole bucca is 

 hairy or bristly, the hairs and i)ristles varying in number and size 

 in different species. 



Mesad of the arms of the frontal suture, constituting the lateral 

 boundaries of the facial fossa, are two distinct ridges, one on each 

 side of the face. These are the vibinssal ridges, so-called because on 

 them the stout bri.-tles called vlbrinKte are inserted. They were 

 called the Jdcinlia hy Desvoidy, by Walker and by Baron Osten- 

 Sacken, but the term used by Professor Brauer, " Vibrusenleisten" 

 meaning vibrissal ridges, is .so much more appropriate, that I prefer 

 to sacrifice prii>iity to good .sense. If we follow tlie vil)rissal ridge 

 dorsad we find that it diminishes in width and gradually disappears 

 from view under the gena. If we follow it ventrad we find that it 

 gradually increases in width, being largest at a point called the 

 vibrixMit nnyle, where the largest of the vibrij<.nc is inserted. The 

 position of the vibrissal angle with relation to the edge of the mouth- 

 opening is not the same in all genera, being sometimes very close to- 

 it and sometimes rather remote. In all tli(! genera to be considered 

 in this paper, however, except I'ollcniit and I'ardcoinpsomi/ia, the 

 two are very close together. Dorsad of the vil>rissal angle we 

 usually find one or more vibrissa- wliich are much snuiMcr than the 

 one in.«erted at the angle Dorsad <»f the smaller vibriB."-:!' the ridge 

 is usually more or less thickly beset with minute bristles as far as 

 or beyond the ventral end of the arm of the frontal suture. Ven- 

 trad of the angh' thi-re are usually a ft'W vil)ri.«sa'. 



The bristles of the legs require also a few words of introduction. 

 These bristles have not as yet received the study that they deserve 

 in the ^[uscidu.^ I believe there is a typical arrangement of these 



12

bristles subject, of course, to great variation but easily recognizable. 

 When the limbs of a Muscid are in their natural position it will at 

 •once be seen that so far as the fore and hind legs are concerned, 

 one surface is turned toward the median line of the body and one 

 away from it ; these are the niesal and lateral surfaces respectively. 

 The lateral surfaces are provided with stouter and more numerous 

 bristles as would be expected if, as is supposed, the function of the 

 bristles is a protective one. The terms flexor and extensor need no 

 explanation. The anterior femur in cross section has the shape I, 

 1, and its bristles (at least the prominent ones) are in three rows, 

 each of which extends from base to apex. Two of these rows are 

 near the extensor border, the one nearest that border being made 

 up of larger Ijristles than the other ; the third row is very near the 

 flexor border ; all three are on the lateral surface. The hind femur 

 is shaped very like the fore femur, and has on its lateral surface an 

 extensor row and a flexor row of bristles, corresponding to the row 

 nearest the extensor border and the flexor row of the lateral surface 

 of the fore femur; the mesal surface has also a flexor row, but its 

 members are smaller and less numerous than those of the flexor row 

 of tiie lateral surface. The middle femur is much less flattened 

 than the others, and in its natural position its surfaces are anterior 

 and [>osterior flexor and extensor ; it has an anterior flexor and 

 posterior flexor row of bristles and also an anterior median and a 

 posterior median row. As a rule the median rows are incomplete, 

 i. e., do not e.xtend all the way from base to apex. The anterior 

 ■commonly ends half way from base to apex, the most apical mem- 

 bers of the row being the largest, the posterior often begins about 

 half way from base to apex, and extends thence to the ai)ex, its 

 apical members being also the largest, and usually the apical three 

 or four form a transverse group of considerable prominence. The 

 tibi:e arc, in cross section, almost triangular with a very well marked 

 extensor bonier and with flexor, mesal and lateral (middle tibia 

 with flexor, anterior and posterior) surfaces. The same diffeienre 

 in size and numl»or of bristles that was noted in the ca.se of the 

 mesal and lateral surfaces of the fore and hind femora is noticeable 

 in the corresponding tibi.'c, but is not so {)ronounced. Each of 

 these surfaces has, ordinarily, a flexor and extensor row of bristles. 

 The middle til)ia has also flexor and extensor rows of bristles on its 

 anterior and posterior surfaces, and it has, in some genera, a prom- 

 inent bristle ou the flexor surface which does not occur (as far as 




172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



my observation extends) on eitlier of the other tibiie, Very often, 

 the surfaces of the tiWix have other rows besides the flexor and ex- 

 tensor, such are usually made up of minute bristles, except for the 

 terminal sul)npical member, but sometimes one or more of the mem- 

 bers are largely (leveloj)ed and in consequence an oblique row of 

 large bristles may appear on the tibia as in I, 2. 



The ajiical bristles of the tibia? are remarkably constant in num- 

 ber, arrangement and relative size. 



Although the number of specimens collected by Dr. Smith in the 

 group Muscidre (sens, strict.) is quite small, only thirty-eight, never- 

 theless the collection is very interesting, including eleven genera, 

 of which three are new, and thirteen species of which seven are 

 new. 



Genus GLOSSINA. 



Glossina longipennis Corti. 



Two females taken August 19, 1894, and August 24, 1894. 

 They agree perfectly with Corti's description, except that there are 

 no brown spots on the abdomen. 



Genus IDIA. 

 Idia lunata \Vicd. 



Three females taken September 29, 1894, October 2, 1894, and 

 November 10, 1894. 



Genus COSMINA. 



Cosmina sp. ? 



Female, taken November 10, 1894. Too imperfect to identify or 

 describe. 



Genus MUSCA. 



Musca domestica L. 



Female specimen, taken October 11, 1894. This is a variety with 

 color and markings of abdomen somewhat like the male. The 

 ground color is a dull reddish-brown, on each of the first three seg- 

 ments there is a narrow, median, cephalo-caudal black stripe ; the 

 whole of the ventral surface of all segments and the cephalic half 

 of the dorsal surface of the first segment are rather more yellow 

 than tlie remainder of the dorsal sui-face. In color of abdomen the 

 specimen reminds 'me of a female specimen sent me by Dr. Wm. A. 

 Na>on, in which the abdomen had the color and markings of the 

 male. Structurally the specimen is identical with domestica although 

 it has, to be sure, five dorso-central bristles behind the suture, but 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



this number occurs occasionally in otherwise normal specimens both 

 of domedica and connna. 



Hasca corvina Fabr. 



One male taken September 10, 1894. 

 Musca biseta nov. sp. 



One male and four females, all taken March 10, 1894. Very 

 much like domestiea, from which it differs as follows: 



Male. — Front about one-half as wide as in specimens of c/o?nea/tca 

 with the same width of head. Dorsum of first abdominal segment 

 entirely black. 



Female. — Front of same width as that of specimens of domestiea 

 with same width of head, but the frontal vitta is decidedly narrower 

 and its lateral borders less curved. 



Both Sexes. — Smaller than the average sized domestiea. Geno- 



vertical plates, gente, buccic and vibris.'«al ridges silvery white, with 



scarcely a trace of the yellowish tinge which so often predominates 



in domestiea. Only tiro dorso-central bristles in front of the suture. 



Bristles of the exteusolateral row of the hind tibia equal or almost 



equal. No prominent bristle in the extenso-mesal row of the hind 



tibia. 



Genus MORELLIA. 

 Morellia podagrica L-xw. 



Two males and one female taken March 10, 1894, and April 10, 



1894. Agree perfectly with, but are smaller than, my European 



specimens of this specie,^. 



Genus P3EUD0PYRELLIA. 

 Pseudopyrellia -('. ' 



One male and one female taken March 10, l^i94. This is a 



new species. The 8f)eciraens are too imperfect to describe fully. 



The antennal arista has longer, more numerous and more delicate 



hairs than coriiiciim (American and Kiir()j)eun specimens), and the 



female has on the thorax, in front of the suture, a broad, median, 



cephalo-caudal hoary strijie which fades out l)efore the suture is 



reached. The di-tinctrie.xs and brilliancy of this stripe vary with 



the incidence of light. Of 100 American female specimens oi com- 



iciun examined not one has this strifie. The front of the male is 



much narrower than in ronilcina. 



Pseudopyrellia nuda imv. •[>. 



Four females taken >rarch 10, 189-1, and September 29, 1894. 

 Length about 8 mm., of a brilliant metallic violet color, varying to 

 bronzy-green. Remarkably few and delicate macrochieta.

Widtli of head about 2.4 nini., of front about 0.7 inni. Vitta occu- 

 pies about one-third of the front. The gente and t lie ventral (juarter 

 or fifth of the geno-vertical j)h\tes are silvery-white or dead black, 

 according to the incidence of the light, the remainder of the geno- 

 vertical plate."^, the ocellar proniinence and the dorsal half of the 

 posterior orbit are metallic violet or green ; the ventral half of the 

 posterior orbit is silvery white, dead black or with metallic reflect- 

 ions according to the incidence of the light ; the buccre are dead 

 black or metallic violet according to the incidence of the light; the 

 vibrissal ridges are black with slight metallic reflections ; the frontal 

 vitta is dead black. The bristles of the vertex are as in cornidna; 

 the hairs of the geno-vertical plates (there are no orbital briistles) 

 are as in cornidna, but much less numerous; the bristles of the 

 vibrissal ridges are yellowish-brown and arranged as in cornicma; 

 the buccaj are sparsely beset with delicate yellowish-brown hairs. 

 Palpi black or dark brown, dilated at the apices; proboscis black 

 or dark brown, with some metallic reflections. Antenna, 2d joint 

 0.2 mm., 3d joint 0.6 mm.; color brown, 3d joint lighter than 2d. 

 The whole thora.K and abdomen has a finely punctate appearance 

 and is remarkably free from macrocha'taj, although quite as thickly 

 clothed with fine hairs as is usual in the MuscidjB. 



Bridles of thorax.— I, 3a, 3b, 3c. Humeral, 1. Dorso-ce)itral, 4, 

 2 in front and 2 behind the suture, the posterior is of good size, the 

 rest are minute. Intra-alar, 1, very small. Supra-alar, 1, very 

 small. Post alar, 2, as usual, of good size. Notopleural, 2, as usual, 

 of good size. Scutellar, apical and two marginal, of good size. 

 Tegulse hyaline; Halteres pale yellow. 



Legs. — Femora black or very dark brown, with some metallic 

 reflections. Til)ite and tarsi black or very dark brown ; bristles of 

 legs much smaller and less numerous than usual in the Muscidaj. 



Fore Leg. — Fetnur. — Only one extenso lateral row of bristles, and 

 this is made up of fewer and smaller bristles than usual. Bristles 

 of flexo-lateral row smaller and much fewer than usual. Tibia. — 

 No prominent bristles except the preapical of extensor border. 



Middle Leg. — Femur. — The usual rows are present, but the indi- 

 vidual bristles are small, and there are but few of them. The only 

 respectable sized bristle of the femur is the preapical of the poste- 

 rior surface. Tibia. — Anterior surface no bristles at all. Posterior 

 surface. — One ])rominent bristle at the middle of the tibia and a 

 varying number of other much smaller bristles. Flexor surface. —

One large bristle, about twice as large as the largest of the posterior 

 surface, at the junction of the third and apical fourths, inserted 

 close to the edge of the posterior surface. 



Hind Leg. — Femur. — The usual rows present but of fewer and 

 smaller bristles than usual. Tibia. — No prominent bristles save 

 one very delicate flexo-lateral. 



Genus POLLENIA. 



I might consider the species to be here described as the type of a 

 new genus in deference to the views of Professor Brauer as I under- 

 stand them. He gives as one of the characters of Pollenia: " two 

 orbital bristles in the female." These specimens have from four to 

 six orbital bristles of large size inserted in a dorso-ventral line 

 roughly parallel to the insertions of the trans-frontal bristles and 

 laterad these large orhitalsand parallel to them another row of very 

 small bristles. I am sure that the number of large orbital bristles 

 mav vary in individuals of the same species and, therefore, am per- 

 sonally of the opinion that their numl)er is not always a character 

 of generic value, e. g., in our common species of Morellia the num- 

 ber of large orbital bristles varies from two to seven, frequently dif- 

 fering on the two .>ides of the .same specimen. Such being the case, 

 it seems to me that I must include this species in PoUenin since it 

 presents all the characters of that genus excejit the one mentioned. 

 The woolly hair is pre.sent only on the caudal border of the meso- 

 pleura, caudad the row of bristles which protect the root of the 

 wintr, a condition often met with in our common /*. rndii^ if the 

 specimen is not fresh. The specimens look as if they had been wet. 

 Pollenia virido-cana nov. i^i.. 



Three females taken 8epteml>er 5, 1895. Length about 7.") mm. ; 

 width of head about 2.2 mm., of front al)out 0.75, of frontal vitta 

 al)out 0.25 mm. Looking at the head directly from in front, the 

 height of the eye is 1.3 mm., of the bucca 0.4 mm. Tiie highest 

 point of the vertex is a little higher (about 0.1 mm) than the high- 

 est point of the eye. The third antennal joint is twice as long as 

 the .second. 



The general color of the fly is a dirty greenish-white or gray. Ou 

 close examination it is seen that the ground color of the thorax and 

 alxloinon is a metallic green, but that this is more or less concealed 

 by a thick, whiti.-sh, hoary coating. In some lights there seem to 

 be two dorso-central bands on the thorax which are free fronj this

coaling. The anterior femora are of the same colors as the thorax, 

 tlie middle and j)()sterior femora are dark brown, with here and 

 there suggestions of the green color and hoary coating. Tlie tibiae 

 and tarsi are a very dark brown. Tegulie milky wiiite. Halteres 

 brownish. The genaj, geno-vertical plates, ocellar triangle, poste- 

 rior orbits, buccie and vihrissal ridges are dirty white with the usual 

 silky lustre, varying according to the incidence of the ligl)tto a pale 

 brown. Frontal vitta pale brown. Antennae: second joint pale 

 brown, tliird joint darker brown with hoary coating. 



Bristles of Head. — Inner vertical, outer vertical, greater ocellar, 

 and ciliie of posterior orbit as in P. 7'udis. Lesser ocellar less 

 numerous than in rudis, only three or two pairs. Ascending frontal, 

 one, large. Transfrontal six to eight, mostly decussate over the nar- 

 row vitta. Orbital : a row of four to six large bristles, the inser- 

 tions of which are roughly parallel to the insertions of the trans- 

 frontals ; a second row laterad the large ones and parallel to them 

 composed of very small bristles. Genje bare. Bucca? with a series 

 of stout bristles along the edge of the mouth opening and with the 

 remainder of their surface sparsely beset with very fine hairs. Vi- 

 brissa! ridges with a very few hairs dorsad the principal vibrissa 

 extending little or not at all dorsad the ventral end of the arm of 

 the frontal suture. 



Bristles of Thorax, I, 5a, 5b, oc. Humeral, 3. Post- humeral, 2. 

 Dorso central, 6, two in front of and four behind the suture. 

 Acrostichals very small, one anterior and two posterior to the 

 suture. Intra-alar, 4, one in front of and three behind the suture; 

 the most posterior is very small and a little mesad the line of the 

 others. Supraalar, 3, of which, as usual, the middle one is much 

 the largest. Post-alar, 2, as usual. Notopleural, 2, as usual. 



Sciifellar. — A small bristle of the jugum, an apical, two marginal 

 and a rather small discal. 



Bristles of Abdomen. — As usual in Muscidse (sens, strict.). 



The macrochaetseof thehead and thorax and nearly all the minute 

 bristles and hairs of the thorax and abdon)en appear to be inserted 

 at the centres of little black disc-shaped spots. 



Bristles of the Legs. — Too imperfect to be described. The only 

 especially noteworthy feature that can be made out is a long, stout 

 bristle at the middle of the anterior surface of the middle femur. 

 This represents, apparently, the anterior median row of bristles of 

 the middle femur that is so universally present in the Muscidse (sens, 

 strict.) and is so well developed in P. rudis.

Genus LTJCILIA. 

 Lacilia spinicosta nov. sp. 



One male and one female, taken ]\rarch 10, 1894. Length : 

 about 5.5 mm. (male) and 6.0 nun. (female). Width of head: male 

 2.0 mm. female 2.2 mm. AVidth of front: male 0.1 mm. at narrow- 

 est part, females 0.8 mm., vitta of female 0.5 mm. Third antennal 

 joint twice as long as the second. 



Color. — The usual metallic green of Lucilire with some hoary re- 

 flections. Legs yellowish-brown, femora much darker than tibice 

 and tarsi. Teguke: inferior dark smoky brown almost black, supe- 

 rior hyaline. Halteres yellowish. Gente, geno-vertical plate, pos- 

 terior orbit, buccae and vibrissal ridges silvery-white. Antennse: 

 second joint and base of third yellowish-l)rown, remainder of third 

 chestnut-l)rown. Palpi yellowish-brown. Wings hyaline, slightly 

 stained with yellowish-brown toward the costal border. 



On tlie costal border of the wing, basad of but very close to the 

 end of the auxiliary vein, is a good sized spine. On both the uj)per 

 and under surfaces of the wing the third longitudinal vein bears a 

 number of D)inute spines, those beneath are four or five in number 

 and much more delicate than those above, those above are ten or 

 twelve in number and extend nearly to the small cross vein. 



Jiristlei* of the H'^ad. — As usual in Lucilife. 



Bristles oj the Thorax. — I, 7a, 7b, 7c. Humeral, S. Pod humeral, 

 2. Dorso-central, 5, 2 in front and 3 behind the suture. Intra alar, 

 4, one in front and 3 behind the suture. Acrostichal, 5, 2 in front 

 and 3 behind the suture. Prcnitural , jiotopleitral, »upra alar and 

 post alar as usual. Srutellar, aj)ical, 3 marginal and one discal. 

 8ternoj)]eura an(^ mesopleura as usual in Luciliic. 



liri.^le.'i of Abdomen. — On hind border of second segment a num- 

 ber of small ajjpressf'd bristles. On hind border of third segment 

 about twelve to fourteen larger and less ai)pro.<.xed bristles. On the 

 fourth segment about twelve not at all aj)pres.'5ed quite good sized 

 bristles both marginal and discal. In the male these bristles are 

 larger than in th«- female. 



JirUfles of the Legs. — Fore Leg. — Femur : as usual but dorsal 

 lateral extensor row has only about six members. Tibia: in the 

 lateral extensor row there is in the male, but not in the female, a little 

 basad the junction of middle and apical thirds one rather prominent 

 bristle ; in the lateral flexor row there is one large bristle at the 

 junction of the apical and middle thirds; in the mesal extensor row 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THK ACADKMY OF [1898. 



tliere are no prominent bristles; in the niesal flexor row there are 

 about four prominent bristles and these are larger in female than in 

 the male. 



Middle Leg. — Femur: as usual. Tibia: the anterior surface, a 

 little apicad the middle, has one large bristle ; the posterior surface 

 has two rather smaller, one at the middle and one near the apical 

 end of the basal third ; flexor surface has one at about the junction 

 of the middle and apical thirds. 



Hind Leg. — Femur: as usual. Tibia: the lateral extensor row 

 has from three to five prominent bristles and the mesal extensor row 

 two, of which one is very near the middle and the other in the 

 basal quarter; no prominent bristles in either flexor row. 



Genus PAROCHROMYIA. 



The species to be here described would find its place in the table 

 of Brauer and Bergenstamm' between Ochromyia and Zonochroa. 



The eyes of the male are very close together but not in contact 

 and the male has no transfrontal bristles above the middle point be- 

 tween the base of the antennie and the vertex. Both sexes have 

 ocellar bristles. Both sexes have abdominal marochsetse at the sides 

 of each segment, on the hind margin of the third segment (appresaed 

 and delicate), and on the fourth ; the male also has some on the 

 hind margin of the second but they are more delicate than those of 

 the third. The female has one fair sized orbital bristle at the upper 

 part of the geno-vertical plate and, extending ventrad from this, a 

 series of very delicate, minute bristles or hairs which extend along 

 the whole of the geno-vertical plate and on the gena about halfway 

 to the end of the arm of the frontal suture. 



In Girschner's system I should place this species among the Cal- 

 liphorinre with the description of which it agrees^ except that it has 

 three posterior intra-alar bristles. The sterno-pleural bristles have 

 the arrangement 1-1. I can not make out the arrangement of the 

 secon<l ventral segment. 



Farochromyia varia nov. gp. 



Three males and three females, taken March 10, 1894, Nor. 17, 

 1894, Sept. 3, 1895. A pale yellowish-brown fly about 6.5 to 7.5 

 mm. long. The wings are notably broad and extend a little 

 beyond tbft apex of the abdomen.

Head. — The antennse, buccae, genae, vibrissal ridges, facial fossa 

 and ventral third to lialf of the geno-vertical plate are all pale 

 yellowisli-hrown. The remainder of the geno-vertical plate is bluish 

 gray. The frontal vitta is brown with a slight reddish tinge. The 

 posterior orbit differs in the two sexes. In the female it is about 

 0.1 mm. wide, bluish-gray dorsally and shading off ventrally to pale 

 yellow ; in the male it is narrower, entirely absent along the dorsal 

 third or half of the eye and entirely yellow. In the female the front 

 occupies about one-third of the width of the head and is mostly made 

 up of the frontal vitta the geno-vertical plate being very narrow. 



Bristles of the head. — Female : — Seven to nine transfrontal of good 

 size and a few small intercalary, sometimes the larger ones decu.«sate 

 and sometimes not, they extend a little ventrad the insertion of the 

 antennse. Ascending frontal, one. Orbital as mentioned in the 

 generic description. Greater ocellar, of good size, divergent. Lesser 

 ocellar, several pairs all parallel to the greater; one very small pair 

 is situated ventrad the greater, there are several small pairs dorsad 

 the greater and one pair at the dorsal border of the ocellar triangle 

 is half to three quarters the size <jf the greater. Inner vertical and 

 outer vertical, inserted as usual, equal ; only a little larger than the 

 ascending frontal, larger than the greater ocellar. Post vertical 

 small, erect, j)arallel to one another, inserted on the occipito-vertical 

 border a trifle caudad the line of the inner verticals. Oi<ipilo- 

 central, very small an«l delicate, in.serted very close to the occipito- 

 vertical edge. Occi])ito-lateral not present. Ciliie of jiosterior 

 orbit rather sparse but well aligned, extending ventrad to the caudo- 

 veniral an^le of the eye. Bucca: vertical diameter as seen from in 

 front nearly one half that of eye; along edge- of mouth-opening a 

 series of large stout bristles, the remainder sparsely beset with min- 

 ute hairs. Vil)rissal ridges: a few minute bristles dorsnd the prin- 

 cipal vii>rissa extending to a point a very little dorsad the ventral 

 end of the arm of the frontal suture. 



Male: — Transfrontal, as mentioned in the generic description, 

 about seven in number. Inner vertical ^'ood sized. Outer vertical 

 absent as is usual in male Muscidre. Greater ocellar much smaller 

 than in the female (the usual thing in Muscida?). I>esser ocellar, 

 quite numerous, some of them almost equal to the greater. Post 

 vertical as in the female. ()cci|)ito-central (doubled in one speci- 

 men), ciliie of posterior orl)it, bucca and vibrissal ridges as in female. 



Antenna. — Third joint about twice as long as the second. Arista 




180 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



longer than second and third joints together, its hairs rather few 

 (al)t)ut eight above and six below). The exact shade of color varies 

 in different specimens, being soinetiines darker and sometimes lighter; 

 in one female the third joint is almost a chestnut-brown. Proboscis 

 and palpi yellowish-brown. 



Thorax. — Color, varying shades of yellowish-brown, darker on the 

 dorsum. On the dorsum, bands of dark brown or blui.sh-gray, vary- 

 ing much in width in different specimens (in one male none at all). 

 A dark spot on the middle of the scutellum in all the females and 

 in one male. 



Bristles of the Thorax, I, 9a, 9b, 9c. Humeral, 3. Posthumeral, 

 3, outermost on a level ventrad the presutural. Dorso-central, 6, 

 two in front and four behind the suture. Intra-nlar, 4, one in front 

 and three behind the suture. Acrostichal, 6, three in front and three 

 behind the suture. Presutural, notopleural, supra-alar and {)08t-alar 

 as usual. Post-sutural, I venture to apply this name to a bristle, 

 present in all the specimens of this sj)ecies, which I have not been 

 able to find in any other Muscids that I have seen. It is situated 

 caudad the transverse suture of the thorax, a little mesad and cau- 

 dad the anterior supra-alar, and laterad the intra-alar No. 3 (I num- 

 ber the intra alars, dorso-centrals and acrostichals from the caudal 

 end of the thorax cephalad, thus the intra-alar nearest the scutellum 

 isNo.l). 



Scutellar. — Apical, three marginal, jugal, two discal of which the 

 anterior is considerably the larger. 



Abdomen. — Color : Principally yellowish-brown; of varying shade 

 in different specimens. There are also some very dark brown, al- 

 most black, markings as follows : on the first segment a very nar- 

 row band on the hind margin ; on second segment a broader band 

 and a median mark, (I, 11) the width of the band and the size of the 

 mark varying considerably ; third segment like second, but the band 

 broader and the mark larger, so that in some specimens almost the 

 whole segment is dark brown or black : fourth segment entirely 

 black or dark l)rown. 



Bristles. — There are bristles on the hind borders of the first three 

 segments. Toward and at the sides of the segments the bristles are 

 larger than toward the middle. All are more or less appressed. 

 Those toward the middle can hardly be called macrochaetae until 

 we reach the third segment. On the fourth there are some discal as 

 well as marginal macrochaetae, and they are none of them ap- 

 pressed. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 181 



Legs. — Color: Yellowish-brown. Bristles: Fore-leg, femur, as 

 usual. Tibia, lateral flexor row has one large bristle at the junction 

 of the middle and apical thirds, mesal extensor row has from four 

 to six rather small bristles al)out equal and equi-di*tant, extending 

 from very near the base to very near the apex. Middle leg : Femur, 

 as usual, but the anterior median row is represented by only one 

 bristle of good ?ize which is situated just at the middle of the femur. 

 On the whole, the bristles of this femur are rather few. Tibia : An- 

 terior surface, one large bristle at junction of apical and middle 

 thirds ; posterior surface two, rather smaller at junction of basal and 

 middle, and middle and apical thirds respectively; flexor surface 

 one, rather small at junction of apical and middle thirds. Hind leg : 

 Femur, as usual. Tibia, mesal extensor row has usually two promi- 

 nent i)ut not very large bristles situated respectively at the junction 

 of the basal and midille, and middle and apical thirds (sometimes 

 the former is absent); lateral extensor row has a considerable but 

 varying number of unequal but almost equidistant bristles extend- 

 ing from base to apex ; lateral flexor row is represented by only 

 one bristle situated at the junction of the apical and middle thirds. 



Genus SOMALIA. 



There is but a single specimen, and that a female of the species 

 on which I found this new genus, but the characters are so pro- 

 iiounced that I have no hesitation in so doing. In the table of 

 lirauer tfe Bergenstamm' this genus would fall in the group with 

 Diuyphora, except that it has but one large orbital bristle. It dif- 

 fers, however, from Danyphora in several points: (1) the sterno- 

 pleural bristles have the arranjreinent 2-1, instead of l-.S ; (2) there 

 is a row of bristles on the hypo-pleura ; (8) the third joint of the 

 antenna is much shorter as compared with the second ; (4) the out- 

 line of the arista as a whole is much ruirrower, and its hairs are less 

 closely set; (")^ the eyes are only minutely hairy with a magnifica- 

 tion of twenty diameters; (6) tl>e post-vertical bristles are very 

 small, while in Daxyjthora they are large. 



In (iirschner's classificatitm the new genus stan<l8 far away from 

 Dasyphora in the Oth or 7ih group of his Tachinidre.

Length about 8.0 mm. Width of head 2.5 mm., of front 0.9 mm. 

 (vitta 0.5 mm., geno-vertical plates each 0.2 mm.). Looked at 

 squarely from in front the dorso-ventral diameter of the head is 2.3 

 mm., the vertex extends 0.1 mm. dorsad the eyes, the dorso-ventral 

 diameter of the eye is 1.5 mm., of the bucca 0.7 mm. Third anten- 

 na! joint about H times as long as the second. General color pale 

 olive-green with a hoary coating, legs a yellowish-brown, except 

 that the third, fourth and fifth tarsal joints and the apical part of 

 the second are black. On the thorax, in front of the suture, are two 

 narrow bands, one on each side, between the acrostichal and dorso- 

 central bri«!tle.s, which have no hoary coating ; these bands broaden 

 ceplialad and unite at the cephalic border of the thorax. On the 

 second, third and fourth abdominal segments there is a narrow, 

 median, cephalo-caudal dark brown stripe not represented in the 

 diagram, I, 13, which shows also the arrangement of the abdominal 

 bristles. 



Head. — Color: Genae, geno-vertical plate, facial fossa, vibrissa! 

 ridges, posterior orbits and ocellar prominence silvery ; vitta dark 

 brown; bucca olive; transverse impression of the face yellowish- 

 brown with silvery coating. Second joint of antennte yellowish- 

 brown, third joint darker with a hoary coating. Palpi yellowish- 

 brown. Proboscis black. 



Bristles: Trans-frontal, about eight, of which the ventral four or 

 five are of good size and inserted close together, the rest small and 

 scattered. Ascending frontal, one, large. Orbitals, one large at 

 about the junction of the dorsal and middle thirds of the front and 

 one exceedingly minute a little dorsad the large one, no others at 

 all. The bri.stles at the vertex are somewhat injured, and I can 

 only say that the inner vertical, outer vertical, greater and lesser 

 ocellar, post-vertical (very small), and ciliae of the posterior orbit 

 are present ; nothing unusual can be made out in regard to them in 

 this specimen. Geua? naked. Buccse distinctly separated from the 

 vibrissa! ridges ; parallel to the edge of the mouth-opening and a 

 little distance from it is a row of coarse bristles; near the cephalic 

 end of the bucca about as far dorsad the large bristles of the mouth- 

 edge as they are from the mouth edge itself, are two stout bristles 

 about equal in size to those of the mouth edge ; the rest of the bucca 

 is rather sparsely beset with minute bristles and hairs. Vibrissal 

 ridges : The principal vibrissa and the vibrissal angle are close to 

 the edge of the mouth opening ; dorsad the principal vibrissa there 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



are only a few minute bristles not extending as far as the ventral 

 end of the arm of the frontal suture ; ventrad the principal vil)rissa 

 are four lesser vibrissa inserted along the edge of the mouth opening 

 aa far as the cephalic end of the bucca.

 haps deserve to be called bri<tlcs, an arrangement recallinir the 

 prominent bristle in this situation which is so constant in the genera 

 Morellia, Muscinia, Musca, Mi/o/tpila and their allies. As usual, there 

 is a large bristle just ventrad the prostigma, a little ventrad and 

 caudad this bristle is another, much smaller but decidedly promi- 

 nent, which I have not found in any other Muscid.

Genus PARACOMPSOMYIA. 



Very close to Compsomyia. In the table of genera of Brauer and 

 Bergenstamm it would fall with Compsomyia from which it differs as 

 follows : wings not hyaline but, toward base and costa, black or very 

 dark brown ; thorax without longitudinal black stripes ; the vibrissal 

 angles are not as far dorsad the mouth edge as in Compsomyia; 

 there are no vibrissa ventrad tlie ))riiici{)al vibrissa; the orbital 

 bristles are much smaller than in Compsomyia and are directed 

 laterad instead of ventrad ; the sterno pleural bristles are 1-1 instead 

 of 2-1.

A NEW WEASEL FROM NEW MEXICO. 

 BY C. M. BAUnKR AND T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



Putorius frenatus .-ulji<i.. neomexicanus n. suljsp. 



Similar to P. frenatus, but paler in color; white markings on 

 head more extensive, the white patch between the eyes large, quad- 

 rangular, and confluent with the stripes between eye and ear. 



Color. — Upper parts, including legs and body from shoulders to 

 tail, entirely of a uniform pale yellowish ochre, a sort of dilute 

 coffee color, but warmer; feet decidedly pallid, but not white. 

 Tail the color of the back, but rather more tinged with reddish, the 

 apical 50 mm. black. Under parts, including breast and throat, 

 uniform light yellowish-ochreous, a tint like that of the back but 

 somewhat paler. Head brownish-black ; a large quadrangular 

 creamy-white jjatch between the eyes, slightly broadest behind, 

 about one-fifth longer than its greatest breadth, narrowly confluent 

 with broad white bands between the eye and ear, which latter ex- 

 tend downward and backward, fading gradually into the ochreoua 

 color of the under parts. Face in front of median white patch 

 slightly speckled with whitish. Long bri.'^tles of upper lip, some 

 black and some white ; a variable amount of white on upper lip ; no 

 black behind angles of mouth. Hair of ears brown-black, but white 

 hairs from the lateral bands invade the lower anterior parts, over- 

 lapping the aperture. The black of the head fades into brown be- 

 hind the plane of the ears, and shows here a small whitish mark ; 

 the area behind the lower part of the ears is strongly suftused with 

 blackish, contrasting with the yellowish-white immediately below. 



Cranial characters. — Compared with ^lerriam's figure of the skull 

 of frenatus (N. A. Weasels, PI. Ill, f. ]), the skull of neomexicanus 

 is similar, but the frontal region is less narrowed anteriorly and 

 slightly more convex ; and the zyomatic processes seem less produced 

 in a lateral direction ; the occipital condyles are more produced be- 

 hind. 



Total length of skull 54 mm.; greatest breadth 32 ; interorbital 

 breadth 141 ; foramen magnum to plane of last molars 34 mm. 



Measurements (of type specimen in flesh). — Length 500 mm., tail 

 205, hind feet 50.

Hab. — The Mesilla Valley of Xew Mexico, near the Rio Grande, 

 alt. about 3,800 ft. 



The type specimen was shot in the grass on the shore of Arm- 

 stronor's Lake, Mesilla, Feb. 1, 1898, by Mr. A. C. Tyson. It is an 

 old male ; the teeth are somewhat worn and one or two are gone. 

 It iiad eaten some small rodent, which from the foot found in the 

 stomach seems to be Onychomyn ardiceps Rhoads. A second speci- 

 men, also a male, was given to us by Mr. C. Barnes, who obtained 

 it from Mr. J. J. Roe.se. It was killed by a dog in Mesilla Park^ 

 and \va.<, unfortunately, much decomposed when it reached our 

 hands. It agrees with the typical specimen, except that the throat 

 is whiter and there is a little more white on the upper lip. Mr. 

 Roese report.* that he recently saw four specimens together in a 

 road, early in the morning; this, with the development of the sex- 

 ual organs, leads us to believe that this (beginning of February and 

 ■end of Januarys is the mating season. 



A specimen without any history, in alcohol, is in the collection of 

 the New Mexico Agricultural College. It approaches true frenatus 

 more than our exam[)les, having a spot behind the angle of the 

 mouth, and the white median patch of the head confluent only on one 

 side with the lateral band. The discovery of P. frennf us neomexi- 

 ca;j?i.-t extends the range of the^Ve>iu<u« series many hundreds of miles 

 to the north, and into the Upper Sonoran Zone. One of us, after 

 reading Dr. Merriam's account of the North American weasels, 

 prophesied that there would be a new type found in the Mesilla 

 Valley, and such [)rove3 to l)e the case, the characters of our ani- 

 mal, while surely of no more than subspecific value, being quite 

 di.'jtinct.

ON THE GENUS HALIA OF RISSO. 

 BY WM. 11. DALL. 



The systematic position of the genus Halia, a curious deep water 

 gastropod discovered in the last century, has long been contested. 

 Lamarck (who knew it only by the shell) put it among the land- 

 shells like Achatiiia, Martyn referred it to the whelks {Ihiccinidce), 

 Jay and Sacco classified it in the vicinity of Struthiolaria, and 

 Sowerby near Purpura. Fischer, in 1858, was the first to examine 

 it anatomically and concluded that it was one of the Toxifera, 

 related to Pleurotoma. The paper was one of his earliest and rather 

 crude; though it added materially to our knowledge, the conclu- 

 eions were not altogether satisfactory to students of molluscan 

 anatomy. Nevertheless his view has l)een accepted so late as 1896 

 by M. Cosj-mann, one of the leading paleontologists of France. In 

 1885 Poirier, of the Paris Museum, was lucky enough to obtain a 

 specimen, a female, like that of Fischer, dredged in fifty fathoms 

 at the mouth of the Gambia River. His discussion of the dis- 

 section' added very considerably to our acquaintan'^e with the 

 macroscojjic anatomy and that of the nervous system. He was, 

 however, little less unfortunate than Fischer in his examination of 

 the most important systematic character, the radula, and reported 

 an extraordinary duplication of the oesophagus, such as is quite un- 

 known elsewhere in mollusks, and which would require the most 

 conclusive confirmation to receive credence from anatomists. Poi- 

 rier reverted to the opinion of Martyn that Halia is Buccinoid, 

 which being interpreted into systematic language, means that he 

 recognized in it the characteristics of a rhachiglossate Prosobranch, 

 which is essentially correct. The true relations of this remarkable 

 form were first recognized by Kobelt in a later publication' which 

 has unfortunately remained unfinished and has attracted no atten- 

 tion from anatomists. In view of the fact that the early errors 

 have obtained such a wide currency and that, even in Fischer's 

 Manual, the characters of the nearest allied form are incorrectly 



'Bull. Malac. Soc. de France, July, 1885, pp. 17-50, pi II-IV. 



' Inconographie der schalentragenden europ. Meeresconchylien, II, p. G. 




1898] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



given, it seems worth wliile to restate the latest and most trust- 

 worthy conclusions. 



Each tooth of Halia is shaj)ed much like a "wish-bone," the 

 prongs forming an arched divergent base and the central projecting 

 portion at the junction, the cusp. The attached bases of the arch 

 are turned up a little and indistinctly notched on the edges; the 

 main part of the arch is free and very prominent. When the cover 

 glass of the microscopic slide is pressed down upon the radula the 

 pillars of the arch break away from the cusp at their junction, 

 which led Poirier to regard them as a separate series of lateral 

 teeth on each side, and Fischer, not noticing Troschel's explanation 

 of this part of one of his figures, has been led into the same error in^ 

 regard to the analogous radula of Volnloinitra. Poirier took tlie 

 notched bases of the broken off lateral portions of the single tooth 

 as the distal ends or cusps of his supposed laterals, directly revers- 

 ing their true position. There is only a single row of teeth. 



The position of Halia is unquestionably among the Volntacea. 

 The radula of Scaphella Turneri as figured by Gray, is almost iden- 

 tical, and that o? Volutomitra fjronlandica is closely similar. Halia 

 wants the siphonal appendage of the typical Volutes and so does 

 Volutomitra. Both Scap/iella and Volniomitra are without oper- 

 cula, like Halia. The external form of the foot and head is essen- 

 tially similar in all three. The texture of the shell of Halia, and 

 also its color and c<)]or-[)attern, are essentially identical with those 

 o{ ticaphella (Auniiia) (labia Brod., which has the {)illar imd plaits 

 degenerate. The process of degeneration, aided by the more ample 

 wliorls of Halia, has completed the etlacement of the plaits and the 

 enfeeblement of the pillar or central axis of the shell. The speci- 

 men of Halia at my disposal for study is somewhat worn at the 

 ai)ex, but the form of the nucleus indicates that, like Srapliclla and 

 Volutomitra, '\ts nepionic shell was membranous, and has left a rough 

 scar on the surface of the initial shelly coil, a view eonfinned by 

 Co.ssmann's figure of the nucleus of a fo.ssil species. In .l*(/i/jia 

 the degenerate radula is edentulous, but the type, which began in 

 the Eocene, and has retained its color pattern and general charac- 

 ters ever since, is abundant in the Pliocene, and may rea<lily have 

 thrown off the al)(rraiit Ifalin at that [)eriod from which il is 

 known to date. 



Halia was erected into a family by Kobelt, but it can hardly be 

 said to possess family characteristics, its essential features being 




192 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



negative and due to degeneration from the normal type of the group 

 to which it belongs. The characters of the latter, however, fully 

 justify us in separating, from the operciilate Volutidce with their 

 calcareous uepiouic shell and Buccinoid dentition, the family 

 Scapheliid(B, destitute of an operculum, with a membranous nepionic 

 shell and the peculiar dentition above described. This latter group 

 will include Caricella, iScaphella, Cymblola, Eopsephcea, Auriiiia, 

 Halia, Vohdomitra and their allies. 



The recent Halia has been dredged along the eastern margin of 

 the Atlantic fronj the Bay of Biscay to Senegal. The genus is re- 

 presented in the Pliocene of Italy by one or two forms which have 

 received distinct specific names. The type was first named by 

 Meuschen in the Museum Gronovianum in 1778, and was erected 

 into a separate genus by Risso in 1826.

A NEW GRASSHOPPER MOUSE FROM NEW MEXICO. 

 BY SAMUEL N. RHOAD8. 



Among the ten species and races of short-tailed mice of the gewas 

 Onychomys known to inhabit the United States Nve find a siirjai*- 

 ingly small amount of color variation, or of difference in siae wmtt 

 external proportions, from the type of tlie genus, 0. leucoffaster,i

 ears, dense, silky pelage and huffy gray colors are more or less ^ar- 

 acteristic of all the species ranging from the Saskatchewaa t»lk» 

 Mexican boundary. 



A careful study of their cranial characters is thus necessary i» 

 determining their relationships.

NOTES ON THE FOSSIL WALRUS OF EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. 

 BY SAMUEL N. RHOADS. 



Ill the eleventh volume of the Transactions of the American 

 Philosophical Society,^ Dr. Joseph Leidy describes and figures two 

 specimens of fossil walrus obtained on the coast of New Jersey, and 

 discusses the relationships of the recent and fossil forms of Atlantic 

 walrus. In his opinion there is no foundation for a distinction be- 

 tween the existing species and the so-called Trichechus virginianus 

 of DeKay,' based on a fossil walrus skull from Accomac County, 

 Virginia. 



In the eighth volume of the Journal of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Pliiladelphia, published twenty years subsequent to his 

 paper in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society above re- 

 ferred to, Dr. Leidy describes a walrus tusk from the phosphate 

 beds of Ashley River, South Carolina. This specimen he compares 

 with the tusks of a large skull in the museum of the Academy from 

 Nova Scotia, and concludes that the characters of the South Caro- 

 lina specimen are not of sufficient value to determine whether it per- 

 tained to a species distinct from the living one. The specimen from 

 Nova Scotia, thus casually referred to by Dr. Leidy, is yet in the 

 museum of the Academy, and is by far the most complete fossilized 

 cranium of an adult animal of which we have any record. 



Before passing to a further consideration of the specimens de- 

 scribed by Leidy, it should be stated that Dr. J. A. Allen, in his Me- 

 moir of the Pinnipeds' also records* a skeleton of a fossil walrus 

 " with tusks over five inches long" in the quaternary clays of Port- 

 land, Maine. Dr. Allen does not seem to have examined any fossil 

 specimens of walrus, nor does he venture an opinion as to the 

 specific value of the so-called fossil species. From his full quota- 

 tions of Leidy, however, it is evident that Dr. Allen was inclined to 

 coincide with the determinations of so eminent an authority.

With the specimen from Nova Scotia above alluded to is a mem- 

 orandum, evidently j)enned by the sender and donor of the sj)ecin)en. 

 It reads : — " Office of School Commissioners, 48 George Street [Hal- 

 ifax], 187[1]. Skull of a walrus (Tricheeus rosmaru.'<) Sable 

 Island. Nova Scotia. The walrus is now extinct in Xova Scotia. 

 It was last seen alive on Sable Island sand beaches. There must 

 have been a considerable nuiuiier on the island, as a great nianv of 

 their skulls iiave been thrown up on the benches at intervals after 

 heavy gales. The specimen sent was found some two years since, 

 and as none have been found since then, I am inclined to think it 

 the last of the series. You will observe that the tusks nre partly 

 fossilized. — J. K. W[illis]." This sjjecimen is recor(le<l in the Pro- 

 ceedings of the Academy for 1871, and classitie<l among recent ver- 

 tebrate material. This fact and the tenor of Dr. Leidy's remarks 

 regarding it show that he did not consider it a fossil. This is re- 

 markal)le, as the specimen is of precisely the same nature in color, 

 texture and specific gravity as the larger fo.ssil s[)ecimen which 

 Leidy described and figured in the Philo'<ophical Trnusadiojis, and 

 which came from the beach at Long Branch, New Jersey. Un- 

 doubtedly the Sable Island specimen is of the same age and deriva- 

 tion from an ancient raised sea beach stratum as were the two speci- 

 mens obtained on the shores of" New Jersey, the skeleton from the 

 quaternary clays of Portland, Maine, and the type of DeKav's 

 TrichechuH virf/inlauii.'< from the sea beach of Accomac Count v, Vir- 

 ginia. For tiiis reason all of the.-e f(».«sil specimens arc taken in the 

 following study as typical of the supposed fo.ssil species of Atlantic 

 walrus as compared with the aniniiil now existing on our North 

 Atlantic Coasts of America. 



Of the four fossil specimens mentioned, three are now in the cus- 

 tody of the Acaflemy of Natural Sciences, the one from Sabb- Island 

 and the more perfect of the two New .Jersey specimens figured by 

 Dr. Leidy, being the property of the Academy. The third specimen 

 is the anterior half of the craniiun from Long liranch, loaned to 

 Dr. Jx>idy by Prof. (Jeo. Cook, and figured in the TrtniJ^iH ions of the 

 Philoso})liical Society. It was recently purchased from Prof. \\'ard 

 of Rochester, N. Y., by the New Jersey (Jeological Survey for its 

 museum at Trenton, anrl through the courtesy of Prof. J.C Smock, 

 wa** loaned to Mr. Ijcwis Woolman, of Phibidi-lpliia, for use in this 

 connection. It is to the efrf)rt3 of Mr. Wooltiian ami his scientific 

 interest in the W(jrk of the Survey, as well as hi8devf)tion to original

re:?earoh in the Academy of Natural Sciences that the facts con- 

 tained in this paper are now made accessible. !Mr. Woolraan's at- 

 tempt to locate DeKay's type of T. virgiiiianus resulted in the dis- 

 covery that this specimen was destroyed by fire with the other ob- 

 jects of natural history in the museum of the old New York Lyceum 

 of Natural History, now known as the New York Academy of Sci- 

 ences. 



The loss of this specimen, together with the inadequate descrip- 

 tion of its characters and the crude nature of DeKay's figure of it 

 make the use of the name virginianus for an extinct species of wal- 

 rus questionable, even in the event of proof that the other fossil speci- 

 mens represent a diflferent species from that now existing. However 

 if the characters of these latter can be shown to indicate such a state 

 of affairs and at the same time show no radical differences from what 

 we know of the type of virginianus, it is eminently proper that that 

 name should be applied to them, and the extinct walrus of the 

 trlacial period be so distinguished from Eosmarus rosinariis. 



As Leidy has already shown, DeKay's l)rief diagnosis of virgin- 

 iann-f is equally applicable to Bosmarus rosmarus, and had he not 

 figured the specimen, we would now, on account of the loss of the 

 type, be forced to make virginiaiiasa probable synonym of rowian<«. 

 The fact, however, that the type was a fossil and was figured, and 

 that it, in all probability, represented the same species as the fossil 

 skulls from New Jersey and Sable Island, makes the name as tena- 

 ble as ever for a possible species of fossil walrus. 



The characters of all the fossil specimens show conclusively their 

 closer affinity to rosuiarus than to obesus of the Pacific Ocean, ex- 

 cept in the relative size of the molars. In this respect they ap- 

 proach more nearly the Pacific species as represented in the skull 

 of an old male from Alaska, in which the molars are very large and 

 rounded. The canine tusks of the fossil specimens are cliaracteris- 

 tic of the rather short, heavy, decurved and spreading form seen in 

 rosmarus. In res{)ect of the ratio of the extreme facial width across 

 the maxillaries to the greatest occipital width, it is noticeable that 

 the fcissil specimens come much nearer to obesus, in which the differ- 

 ences between these dimensions are much less than in rosmarus. In 

 the fossil specimen from Nova Scotia the maxillary expansion is 

 203 mm., and the paroccipital expansion (adding 10 mm. for wear) 



* It reads: "Cheek teeth with obliquely truncate crowns, not ridged; the 

 second smaller than the first."

iB278 mm. In a very old male specimen of obesus from Alaska 

 these aieasurements are respectively 220 mm. and 295 mm. In a 

 jwliat younger but adult west Greenland specimen of rosmarus 

 dimensions are 19> mm. and 295 mm. Viewed aiiteriorlv, 

 tike facial outline of the fossil specimens, especially in the oldest 

 Mew Jersey example, shows affinity with the rosmarvs type in the 

 /■datively greater ratio of width to height, and in the Sable Island 

 akvli the median projection of the premaxillaries extends consider- 

 ably beyond the anterior plane of the maxillaries into a blunt, beak- 

 Cke prr^ess. 



fa tl>€ very old recent Alaskan specimen the premaxillaries are 

 «a a plane with the maxillaries at this point, and their median su- 

 tare recedes behind them at its antero-inferior border in a sort of 

 hare4ip conformation. 



Tlie three fossil specimens are remarkable for the great relative 

 ■be of the nasal bones. The New Jersey specimen now belonging 

 %• the Geological Survey of that State is much wider across the 

 iBaxillaries than the widest recent or fos.sil walrus skull in the cus- 

 tody of the Academy, and is from a very old individual. While 

 ^R would expect a corresponding width of the nasal bones, these 

 ««e, Hevertheless, correspondingly l«;ng, also, presentnii,' an area 

 HBU-ly twice as great as in the largest recent walrus skulls in the 

 •aUecjtion. The smaller New Jersey specimen, belonging to the 

 lerny, al.-o has a correspon<lingly large nasal area. The nasal 

 •s in the process of fossilization become sufficiently well-defined, 

 in the oldest specimens, to determine their area. In the larger 

 Mew Jersey s[)ecimen the greatest nasal length is O-S mm., and the 

 pHlteet width 80 mm. In the smaller one these dimensions are 9G 

 ooi.aiHll Hi mm. In the largest (Jreeidand s{)ecimen they are 72 

 ■un. and Go mm., and in the largest Alaskan specimen 72 mm. and 

 Cl«tta. 



Turuitig now to the upper maxillary dcntitioii, a coinparison be- 

 Iwixii the fossil and recent specimens of aged individuals shows the 

 fitl<iwiug marked differences in the ()erraanent teeth.' 



Im recent rosmnrng of nearly the same size jlh the smaller New 

 fcracy fossi I specimen and 25 tnm. shorter in basilar length than the 

 tScotia fossil, all the grinding teeth average about one-half 



i^taiexisions of the fossil siiecimens, and making allowance for 



'isde|it tl)« dental furmula of Dr. .-Mien's Mono^^rapli of the Pinnipeds, 




200 PROCEEDINGS OF THK ACADEMY OF [1898. 



the difference in age they are more than one-third smaller. In the 

 fossil specimens the permanent incisor exceeds the grinders both in 

 tritnrating area and in alveolar depth and calihre. In ro.wuirns 

 and obe.^>"< this tooth is much smaller than "'•. Tlie posterior molar 

 ("— ) in the fossil skulls (excepting the one belonging to the New 

 Jersey Geological Survey),' is a deeply rooted tooth of nearly the 

 same calibre and triturating area as "' '. In both roffinarus and 

 obesiiK it is the smallest and shallowest rooted of the permanent den~ 

 titiou and is sometimes wanting in aged specimens. 



Another marked character which is peculiar to the two fossil 

 specimens belonging to the collection of the Academy, and in some 

 degree to the specimen of the Geological Survey, is the remarkable 

 median depression of the maxillre at the incisive foramina, and the 

 constriction of the inter-incisor space. In the Sable Island example 

 the depth of the incisive foramina below the crown of "'^ is 64 mm. 

 and the distance between the alveoli of the permanent incisors is 

 only 17 mm. In the Long Branch skull it is about the same. In 

 the recent Greenland specimen these measurements are 41 mm. and 

 30 mm., and in the Alaskan s[)ecinien 50 mm. and 30 mm. 



While the foregoing comparisons were made with an amount of 

 material far more comprehensive than that accessible tb Dr. Ijeidy, 

 and supplemented by the valuable diagnoses, figures and tables of 

 measurements given by Dr. J. A. Allen, the author regrtits that a 

 larger series of adult crania of our living species of walrus was 

 not available. Premising, however, that the recent skulls used in 

 this comparison are typical in essential characters of rosmarus and 

 obesiis, and that the fossil skulls, including the type of virrjinianui^, 

 all represent a period of Pleistocene Age, the writer concludes that 

 the weight of evidence favors the separation of the fossil and recent 

 species of Atlantic walrus under the following diagnoses: 



Bosmarus rosmarus (Linnicus). Recent Atlantic Walrus. 



J'hora romnarux Linnti-us ; Syst. Nat., 1758, p. 38. 

 RoKmarus rosmarus Khoads; Araer. Nat., 1894, p. 523. 



Characters. — Ratio of greatest anterior maxillary width to the 

 parocci|)ital expansion, as 2 to 3 ; permanent ujjper incisor much 

 smaller than — ; "-''smallest, shallow-rooted, in old adults some- 

 times ab.sent ; superior grinders relatively weak, the opposing rows 

 separated by a wide incisive diastema twice the width of the largest

molar; roof of mouth gently, evenly rounded, shallow between the 

 grinders; incisive foramina small, not indented, their distance be- 

 low the alveolus of-i only equalling the distance between the two 

 opposing permanent incisors; nasals small, short, rectangular. 



Bosmarus virginianus ( DeKay). Fossil Atlantic Walrus. 



Trichcchus virginianus DeKay; Nat. Hist. N. York, I, p. 50, pi. 19, fig. 1, 

 a, b. 



Characters. — Ratio of greatest anterior maxillary width to par- 

 occipital expansion, a.s 2 to 2] ; permanent upper incisor as large as 

 m.j. m.3 ijirger than " ', nearly as large as permanent incisor, deeply 

 rooted, persistent ; superior grinders massive, crowded, the opposing 

 rows se{)arate(l by a narrow incisive diastema about as wide as the 

 largest molar : root of mouth deeply furrowed between the grinders ; 

 incisive foramina large, acutely indented ; their depth below the 

 alveolus of "' ' being twice as great as the sjiace between the two 

 opposing permanent incisors; nasals large, relatively long, becom- 

 ing much wider anteriorly. 



It should be understood that the above diagnosis of the fos-sil wal- 

 rus rests chiefly on the Sable Island specimen, and the finer skull 

 belonging to the Academy from New Jersey which Leidy figured 

 on plates 4 and 5 of volume XI of the Philosophical Tran-iaetious. 

 Both these skulls evidently belonged to very old males. In some 

 respect.*, as in the relative .<izes of tlie teeth to each other, the other 

 New Jersey specimen and the plate of DeKay's virrjinianxis agree iui 

 their closer approach to the existing walrus. Owing to their frag- 

 mentary condition, as comi>ared with the Sable Island and Long 

 Branch .'<pecimcn, and the fact that tiie latter two agree exactly in 

 all the characters enumerated, it is best to consider these as typical 

 of the fossil animal. As DeKay's typo is destroyed and his diagno- 

 sis and j)late of little value, I would reconmiend that if the charac- 

 ters pointed out in this paper as distinguishing the fos.-^il from the 

 recent Atlantic walrus are sufficiently confirmed by other speci- 

 mens to warrant their separation, that DeKay's name be retained. 

 The evidence in favor of DeKay's fiissil being the same as rosmarvs 

 and the other fossil specimens a distinct species, to which the mune 

 virrfiiiiann.t cannot apply, is too flimsy to merit attention.

The Function of the Radala. — Mr. H. A. Pilsbry spoke of a 

 radula of the gastropod Nerita peloronta exhibited by Mr. Keely, 

 mentioning its great length compared to that of the animal, and the 

 large number of similar teeth at the margins. The modifications 

 found by Fischer in the radula of Neritopsis and by the speaker in 

 that of Orthomesus and the Helicidie indicate that specializatio-n in 

 the Rhipidoglossa and Pulmonata has proceded from the median 

 line of the radula outward, the outer teeth being the last to be 

 modified, and therefore of value as indicating the ancestral con- 

 dition ; this mode of mijdification being probal)ly the result of the 

 greater functional activity of the median portion in feeding, due to 

 the rounded shape of the subradular cartilage. 



Mr. Calvert stated that the position of the radula in .squids 

 recently dissected by him seemed to preclude the u.se of that organ 

 as a rasp, as described for snails. 



Mr. Pilsbry replied that he had not observed any cephalopod 

 feeding, but 8Uf)j)0sed that the radula here acted as an aid to 

 deglutition, crowding the fragments, taken in the beak, down the 

 oesophagus. 



Dr. Chapman observed that he had often observed squids eating 

 fish, and the beaks alone were used to bite the prey. He further 

 alluded to the impossibility of keeping squids in aquaria owing to 

 their incessant activity. They constantly dart against the glass 

 and soon die from the mutilation ensuing.

Rock Inscriptions in Kauai, Hawaiian Islands. — Dr. Benja- 

 min Sharp exhibited a specimen of coquina received from ^Ir. J. 

 K. Farley of Kuuai. He had vi.-«ited Mr. Farley in 1893 with the 

 hope of seeing some rock inscriptions usually covered with sand. 

 An effort to uncover the rocks and expose the inscriptions had 

 then been unsuccessful, although the bed rock had been reached at 

 a depth of six feet. The following letter, acconii)anied by draw- 

 ings of the inscriptions, has recently been received : — 



K(jL<>A, Kai'ai, Hawaiian Island.s, July 13th, 1897. 

 Dr. Benj. Sharp, 



Dear Sir: — When you were here in October, 1893, I promised 

 you tiiat I would send you any new information that T might obtain 

 regarding the figures cut into the .sandstone' ledge at Keoneloa, also 

 diagrams of them if I ever saw them again. 



Oil June loth a native fisherman told me that the drawings were 

 exposed to view at low tide. I went to Keoneloa .lune Kith, 17th, 

 18th, 10th and 'Jlst, and send you herewith, in another package, 

 the result of the visits. On the last date I could do nothing but 

 try cutting the rock with a hatchet and an old native stone adze, 

 as a high surf was fast covering the ledge again with sand. 



With a hatchet one could, I think, make a four foot figure in 

 about two hours, .steady work ; with the adze it would take at least 

 six times as long, and use up a number of such tools. Most of the 

 figures look as if they had been cut with a .semi-pointed implement 

 like a roumled cold chisel. With the corner of the stone adze I was 

 able to Uiake about the same kind of a cut. A whirling motion 

 that I noticed the waves as they ran off the rock gave to the sand, 

 lodged it in the cuts and this may have worn tiie cutting into the 

 sort of rounded pockets noticed. 



I had a talk, June 17th, with an old native woman named 

 Kauila, who has lived near Ker)neloa for many years. She i*iiU\ : — 

 " I first saw the pictures when 1 was about thirteen years old (that 

 was in 1848). I went to see them with my school-teacher and his 

 other scholars and two Iloman Catholic |)rie.st9. My teacher's 

 name was Alexandro, a Frenchman. He was the first Roman 



'The rock is coquina, not sandstone. 




204 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



Catholic priest iu Koloa and built the Roman Catholic Mission 

 buildings. We saw all the picture rocks exposed ; you have only 

 seen a part of them to-day. The priest went home with me from 

 Keoneloa and talked with my father, Walewale, and with my grand- 

 father, and also with a number of other old natives (in those days 

 there were many old people in the land) about the drawings. They 

 had all seen the pictures but had never heard who cut them, or why 

 they were done. The oldest folks said that their fathers and grand- 

 fathers had told them that the ))icture8 had always been there." 



The sand-hills to the west of Keoneloa are said to have been old 

 battle-fields. They were certainly used as burial grounds as we 

 kuow.- 



Fugitives from the Oahu wars are said to have landed at Keone- 

 loa and to have been killed and buried iu these sand-hills by Koloa 

 natives. 



Alexander, in his " Brief History of the Hawaiian People," Chap. 

 15, says "About the end of the 13th century, Kalaunuiohua, a war- 

 like and ambitious Moi (King) of Hawaii, undertook to sul)due the 

 whole group ... he defeated the leading chiefs of Maui, Molo- 

 kai and Oahu. ... he set sail for Kauai . . . and landed near 

 Koloa, where he was met by Kukona, at the head of the warriors of 

 Kauai, and was totally defeated, his fleet being taken, his army de- 

 stroyed. It was about this time that a vessel called ' Maniala ' in 

 the tradition, arrived at Kahului, in Maui. The captain and crew 

 are said to have been foreigners of light complexion, with bright 

 eyes, who intermarried with the natives and became progenitors of 

 a light colored stock. As there were no Europeans in the Pacific 

 Ocean in the 13th century, it is most probable, as Judge Fornander 

 has suggested, that these foreigners were the crew of some Japanese 

 iunk, driven out of its course by a typhoon, and drifted to these 

 shores, as has twice happened in recent times. Also, about the year 

 1527-28, Spaniards, a man and his sister, were saved from a wreck 

 on Hawaii . . , they intermarried with the natives and becan)e 

 the progenitors of certain well known families of chiefs, such as that 

 of Kaikeowa, former Governor of Kauai." 



Jarvis, in his history of the islands, says, " Cook found in the 

 j)Ossession of the natives of Kauai two pieces ()f iron, one a portion 

 of a hoop, and the other appeared to be part of the blade of a broad- 

 sword." " The knowledge and use of iron was generally known." 



Kauila's story would take us back to the early part of the 17th 

 century, without a tradition of the workers. 



The cross and the flag (?)^ make me think that foreigners may 

 have had a hand in the work, or may have given the natives, if 

 they did the work, a knowledge of those emblems. Were it not for 

 them one might think that the pictures were done by a party of 



* We obtained, when with Mr. Farley, a number of bones and one complete 

 skeleton. 



'Referring to the drawing sent with the letter.

North-west Indians, wlio could, I believe, easily, in their large 

 canoes, sail or drift down to the islands with the currents, in a 

 shorter time than a Japanese junk could. One can usually see 

 half a dozen N. W. drift logs on the beach at Keoneloa. On the 

 beaches of Niihau, some fifty miles away, hundreds of logs and 

 Red Wood posts have been picked up a few months after freshets 

 on the Pacific coast of the U. S. and B. C, had washed out the 

 logging dams of the saw mills. 



The last figure on my diagram, I take it, was made to represent 

 a woman in parturition. 



P. S. Since writing the foregoing, I have seen Dr. Emerson of 

 this place. He tells me that eight or nine years ago, he saw on the 

 beach at Honaunau, Kona, Hawaii, somewhat similar drawings, 

 cut into lava rock. Honaunau is not far from Keei, the place at 

 which the Spanish man and woman are said to have landed in 

 about 1527-28. The natives of Hawnii know nothing of the 

 workers. Dr. p]merson says: Kackeoewa came from a Hawaiian 

 family. My "cross" may be a totem. 



Mr. Wm. W. JefTeris was appointed Curator of the William S. 

 Vaux Collections for the current year.

BIRDS OBSERVED IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IN THE SUMMER OF 1893. 

 BY JOHN VANDENBURGH. 



It was my good fortune in tlie summer of 1893 to l)e one of a 

 party of five who, during the weeks from June 21st to July 27th, 

 fairly lived in the saddle, riding nearly eight hundred miles through 

 the Coast Range, interior valleys and Sierra Nevada of California. 

 The other members of the party were Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, Dr. 

 W. W. Thoburn and Professor C. B. Wing of Leland Stanford 

 Junior University, and the Rev. Mr. Briggs, then of San Francisco. 



The main object of the expedition was the gathering of material 

 which would throw light upon certain problems connected with the 

 fish fauna of the streams in the vicinity of Mt. Wiiitney, but all 

 forms of vertebrate life received more or less attention. My time 

 was devoted chiefly to the birds and reptiles, the latter, perhaps, 

 receiving the. major share. Owing to the rapid rate at which it was 

 necessary to travel, opportunities for collecting were not of the best, 

 but the ornithological observations made, are presented in the hope 

 that they may be of interest from the fact that most of the birds 

 were in their breeding ranges and, in many instances, in localities 

 seldom visited by the ornithologist. 



Our route lay in Santa Clara County from Los Gatos and Palo 

 Alto to Saratoga, and thence to Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz 

 County ; June 21st, Santa Cruz ; June 22d, Soquel, Aptos and Wat- 

 sonville ; June 23d, San Juan, Hollister and Tres Pinos ; June 24th, 

 up the valley of the San Benito River to San Benito, Hernandez, 

 Hepsadan Mountain and Erie; June 26-29, across a divide to the 

 Los Gatos Creek, June 29th, and then down this stream and through 

 Pleasant Valley to Huron, June 30th. From Huron we crossed 

 the San Joaquin Valley, by way of Lemoore, Armona and Hanford, 

 to Visalia, July l-3d. From Visalia we went to Three Rivers and 

 then up the east fork of the Kaweak River to Cain's Flat. Weishar 

 Mill and Mineral King, July 4-6th. Crossing Farewell Gap, we 

 spent a day in Shotgun Canon close to Little Kern River, and then 

 went on to Trout Meadows and the south fork of Kern River, reach- 

 ing Little Kern River Lake July 12th and Soda Springs or Big 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 207 



Kern River Lake one day later. Our trail then lead us up Whitney 

 Creek to its headwaters, across to Cottonwood Creek and thus down 

 to Owen's Lake and Lone Pine, July 14-1 tith. From Lone Pine 

 we returned to San Francisco by way of Independence (July 17th), 

 Big Pine (July 18th), Round Valley (July 19th), McGee's (July 

 20th), Troy's near Mono Lake (July 21st), ^lono Pass and Dana 

 Creek (July 22d), Yoseniite Valley (July 23d), Crocker's (July 

 24th), Buena Vi..ta (July 25th), and Stockton (July 2Gth).

The KilMeer was oliserved near Watsf>nvillf', .lune 24ih ; at Tres 

 Pinos, where it was very abundant along the San Benito Creek, 

 June 2')th, and along the Los fJatos Creek and in Pleasant Vulky, 

 June 30th. In the San Joaquin Valley, this l)ird was the almost 

 constant accompaniment of water, .July l-4th. In Owen's Valley, 

 many were seen along the streams and irrigation ditches betwcfn 

 Lone Pine and Bishop, July 1G-I9th.

11. Dendragapus obsourus fuliginosus. Sooiy Grouse. 



The Sooty Grouse was well represented at an altitude of about 

 8,000 feet near Mineral King. Here they were heard at all times 

 of the day, and a female was seen with her covey of young, then 

 about the size of Valley Quail, July 7th. Several were observed 

 by Dr. Gilbert at the head of Shotgun Canon, July 10th. 



12. Zenaidura macroura. Mourning Dove. 



This species was first observed at Watsonville, where it was com- 

 mon in the grain fields. After leaving Watsonville, it was with us 

 constantly to San Juan, Hollister, Tres Finos, up the valley of Sau 

 Benito Creek, across into that of the Los Gatos, thence down Pleas- 

 ant Valley to Huron, across the San Joaquin Valley to Visalia, 

 and up the east fork of the Kaweak River to Cain's Flat, at the 

 lower limit of pines, June 24th, July 5th. Doves were very abund- 

 ant in Owen's Valley, from Lone Pine to Bishop, July 16tb-19th.

REVISION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SLUGS: BINNEYA. HEMPHILLIA. 

 HESPERARION. PROPHYSAON AND ANADENULUS. 



BY HENRY' A. PILSBRY AND E. (i. VANATTA. 



In a former essay* we undertook a revision of the Arionid genera 

 Ariolimax and Aphnlhirion. In the present jjaper the remaining 

 American genera of Arionidce are similarly treated. 



Profiting by a criticism from one' whom all liraacologists acknowl- 

 edge as master, we have extended our anatomical observations to 

 the pallial organs, muscle system, etc., with interesting and we 

 believe important results. 



The genera of Arionidre, often scattered even by the great malacol- 

 ogists among Helicid or Liniacid groups, now fall into orderly se- 

 quence; and in the flood of light disclosed by comparative study of 

 the myology, tl)e phylogeny and approximately final classification 

 of the various groups is seen clearly outlined before us. 



Trivial and unsatisfactory as are the external features of slugs, 

 the details of their internal morphology are wonderfully varied. 

 Everywhere there are important characters ; atid those who starve 

 their souls on a mere study of the genitalia and oral arinatiiro miss 

 the best part of the feast. 



Believing with Cope that all the facta of morphology should be 

 taken into account in systematic clas.'ification — that " system " is, in 

 fuct. an epitome of the total structure, as well as, with certain dis- 

 tortions, a phylogeny of organism.", we have freely used characters 

 from all organs in wiiich we fouii<l <litferenliatiou, in the construc- 

 tion of our scheme of family, 8ul)family and generic classification. 



We must again gratefully acknowledge our indebtedness to vari- 

 ous friends and correspondents for material received, and especially 

 to Messrs. P. li. Kamlolph, J. (i. Malone and Fnd. L. Button. 

 Slugs have also been received from J. G. Cooper, T. D. A.Coekerell, 

 E. H. Ashmun, Wm. H. I)all, W. (1. Binncy and others; and the 

 series in our collection from Henry Hemphill has also been of great 

 service.

 Descriptions of the genera and species, and IV, Brief directions for 

 collecting and preparing slugs. 



I. Anatomy of AiiiOMDiE, 



General external features. — Slugs of the family Arionidre vary in 

 external form from the typical Limax shape, to forms with a con- 

 spicuous dorsal hump. The mantle is generally oval, situated anter- 

 iorly on the body, and completely closed over the shell, but in the 

 humped forms it is more posterior and largfer, extending some dis- 

 tance in front of the shell, which is more or less exposed. The 

 breathing pore is in its right side near the edge, connected therewith 

 by a gutter. The mantle is adnate at the sides and behind, but 

 free for some distance in front. The foot always has longitudinal 

 " pedal furrows " above its lateral edges, defining a vertically grooved 

 band or " foot margin," The pedal furrows meet at the tail, at 

 which point there is often a " caudal gland," pit or slit developed. 

 The surface sculpture of the integument of the foot is varied in the 

 several genera and species. In Ariolimax there are close parallel 

 grooves above, becoming oblique and more spaced at the sides, and 

 with less conspicuous grooves at right angles to these, uniting them. 

 In Hemphlllia, Binneya and Anadenus i\x%vQ is a dorsal groove run- 

 ning back from the mantle, with oblique grooves branching from it 

 on each side. In Prophysaon the surface is divided into a reticula- 

 tion of long diamond shaped meshes by pigmented grooves, each 

 mesh being further subdivided. One species, F. cceruleum, is an 

 exception, having longitudinal grooves as in Ariolimax or Avion. 



The sole is distinctly divided into three longitudinal tracts separ- 

 ated by grooves in Anodenulus. In some other genera (Arioliina- 

 cinoe.) there is an indistinct tripartite division, while in others {Pro- 

 physaon, Hemphillia, etc.), this is not recognizable. 



Shell. — The shell varies in form from a moderately well developed 

 sj)iral {Binneya) or a convex plate (Hemphillia) exposed entirely 

 or in part by an orifice in the mantle, to a nearly fiat, wholly inter- 

 nal plate as in most of the other genera. In some forms of Prophy- 



* The elementary character of a portion of this paper scarcely calls for apol- 

 ogy in view of the fact that the HtiHJy of slugs in America is still in an em- 

 bryonic condition. While in Europe there are many expert observers, we 

 have probably not more than four or live men in America who have given 

 especial attention to them. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 221 



sann and Avion this plate is largely cuticular, the calcareous layer 

 being representerl only by scattered, angular, granules. In all cases 

 the :-hell-cavity in the mantle is small, not much larger than the en- 

 closed shell. This contrasts strongly with the allied family Pliilo- 

 inycidfe, which has an enormously extended, era|)ty shell sack. 



General internal topof/rapliij. — In most genera of" completely 

 limaciform external contour, the body from head to tail is excava- 

 ted into one general body cavity (see these Proceedings for 1806, 

 PI. XIII, fig. 1), in which the digestive system lies extended, with the 

 genitalia lying parallel with or across it, the liver /)r liver and ovo- 

 testis extending into the tail. In genera with a dorsal hump (Biri- 

 neya and Hemphillia) that portion of the foot behind the posterior 

 end of ihe hump is not excavated, but solid as in Helix ami other 

 spiral-shelled genera. The liver and ovotestis lie in the posterior 

 portion of the cavity of the hump, into which the viscera are 

 crowded upward and forward. Along the Hoor of the body cavity, 

 extending from below the mouth a variable distance backward, lies 

 the suboral gland (P. A. N. S., 1896, PI. XIII, f. 1), which in some 

 genera is dee[ily imbedded in the niuscidar tissue of the sole, in 

 others lies lightly attached thereto.* In Ariolimax and its immedi- 

 ate allies the genital system including the ovotestis, is crowded for- 

 ward into the anterior half of the aninjal's length ; in Projthysnon 

 and most other genera it lies stretched out at greater length, and 

 the albumen gland and ovotestis are decidedly posterior. Other 

 peculiarities in the arrangement f>f the organs are noticed below. 



Aiiinculdry tract. — The buccal body in Ariouidic is short, as in 

 allied families of snails. The jaw varies from thin ami flexible to 

 strong, is of the ordinary arched f(jrm, and is always sculj)iured an- 

 teriorly. The usual sculpture consists of numerous (lattened ribs 

 denticulaling the cutting margin ; but in I'ritphymon fusrintuni the 

 structure is rather a series of narrow, hanlly overla|)ping or imbri- 

 cating plait"*, much a.x in .some species of the genus Flmnmulinn of 

 the Eniloflnntiihn. In I', humitr the plaits seem <|uite lost in 

 a general, close, vertical -triation. as in riiritml'hi/n, ii\-s,) a ircnus of 

 Endodontidie.

gradually into the raargiual series by shortening of the basal-plates. 

 Marginals bicuspid, with occasionally a tooth with the ectocone 

 bifid. In the Ariolimacince the inner cusps of the outer lateral and 

 inner marginal teeth are much leiigtliened and ol)lique, theectocones 

 much reduced, simulating the pseudo-zonitoid teeth of Fluminulina. 

 Arion also shows this tendency to a much less degree. In the other 

 genera the cusps of these teeth are short or of moderate length. 



All Arionidre have four longitudinal folds of the intestine,* as 

 usual in slugs generally ; the main divergence being in the compar- 

 ative length of the folds and the degree of their torsion. The folds 

 are designated by the initial G with exponents 1, 2, 3, 4, as in PI. 

 XI, fig. 29. The anterior loop between G' and G^ is caught up by 

 the cephalic artery immediately upon its emergence from the di- 

 aphragm (PI. XIV, figs. 66, 70, 72). h\ Arion the posterior loop 

 between G' and G\ forming the lower end of the stomach, lies pos- 

 terior to all other intestine folds;* but in all the other American 

 genera the loop formed by G'' and G* lies behind the stomach. 



In Ariolimax, Aphallarion and Hespe> arion (PI. XI, fig. 33) the 

 gut is long and spirally wound. In Frophysaon (PI. XI, figs. 28- 

 30, 32, 34), Anademdus (fig. 35), Hemphillia (fig. 36) and Binneya 

 (fig. 31) it is much less twisted spirally. In the latter two genera 

 the posterior loop formed by G^ and G* is very short, on account of 

 the crowding forward of the viscera into the dorsal hump. 



In Prouhysaon, Anadenulns, Hemphillia and Binneya there is no 

 differentiation of the first fold into crop and stomach, such as occurs 

 in Ariolimax, etc. 



Reproductive organs. — In the Arionidce there are two main types 

 of genital organs. In the Jiiore primitive and normal type tiiere is 

 a well developed penis provided with a retractor muscle, and in 

 every way homologous with the same organ in the Helices and pul- 

 monate snails generally. This may be seen in Ariolimax, Hcsper- 

 arion (PI. XII, figs. 44, 47), Binneya, Hemphillia, and the Himal- 

 ayan genus Anadenus. In the slugs, as well as in many other 

 snails, the terminal portion of the vas deferens is noticeably enlarged, 

 often considerably swollen for a distance above its insertion in the 

 penis (see PI. XII, fig. 49, epi., Hemphillia ; and these Proceedings, 

 1896, PI. XIV, fig. 14, epi., Ariolimax). This enlarged tract has 



* In Af^hnllarion there is a short loop interposed between the second and 

 third long folds, making six folds. See P. \. N. S., 1S9G pi. 13, f. 4.

been called the " epiphallus." In the other type, to which Ario)i, 

 Geomalacus, Prophysaon and Aphaliirion belong, the penis has been 

 lost through degeneration, and the vas deferens enters the atrium 

 directly, its lower course being enlarged or modified in vari(jiis ways 

 (PI. XIII, all fig--*.) as described above, into an epiphallus." The epi- 

 phallus is not evertible, has no retractor, and does not have the 

 function of a penis. In it the sperm is lodged in packets or " sperm- 

 atophores." These, in Hesperarion and Prophy.^aon, are oblong, 

 narrow capsules of chitinous texture, with a long, slender filament 

 at one end (PI. XII, fig. 43). They may occasionally be found in 

 the spermatheca (PI. XII, fig. 48, where the outlines of several are 

 faintly visible through the wall). In genera with this type of geni- 

 talia the vagina and lower portion of the free oviduct are introvert- 

 ible, and assume the function of the penis, being provided with a 

 retractor or retractors; and in some genera, such as Ariou, ihe 

 spermatheca duct also has a retractor muscle. In forms having the 

 spermatheca duct iuserted directly uj)on the atrium, there is, of 

 course, no vagina, and the free lower ])ortion of oviduct alone acts 

 as peni.s.'' The peculiar enlargement of the epiphallus in Prophy- 



'Tho term epiphallus wa.s originally proposed some years ago by the senior 

 authr>r of lliis pajter for the structure as commonly found in such f/f/iriJ.c an 

 tiie West Indian Cttniroliis and I'Luroiionii species, and in most of the larger 

 lOast Indian and Australian forms, in which it occurs associated with a well- 

 developed penis a.s in Hfsptrarion, etc. It is strictly synonymous with Sim- 

 roth's term '' I'atronenstre, kt\" Mr. Collinge (I'roc. Zool 8oc. Lond., ISDT, 

 p. 417) proposes to substitute " spomi-duct " for what we term epipliallu-, 

 and restrict the latter name to " the terminal portion of the vas deferens aliove 

 the sperm-duct." There is, of course, no ol)jection to the suh-litiition of an 

 Knglisli name for the Greek compound, but -ince the term epiphallus h.is 

 already been used in exf»ii>ive and luimerous works in .America, luigiand and 

 < ierniany, it scents a little revolutionary to conipletely alter it> si;,'ni(icance. 

 If Mr. rollinge wants a term for the vas deferens above the epiphallus, he 

 had belter, to avoid confusion, invent a new one; though what he wants it for 

 is not ipiite apparent 



"* .Irion is a case in point, <■/. Collinge, I'roc Zool. Soc. Lond., IH'JT, p. 147. 

 Geomaliiitis also is similar. In I-'rophysaoti and Af'liallarion however, it is the 

 vagina proper which performs both its usual functi(m and that of an evertible 

 penis. We consider Mr. CoHinge's statement (/. r. ) that *' Messrs. i'ilsbry

 oviduct" will naturally be retained for the pa-».sage from the apex of the va- 

 gina (when [)ri-sent i to the point of a|>proximalion of the vas deferens. Mor- 

 phologically, the vagina may be regarded as au elongated portion of the 

 atrium.

saoii is not hollow like a penis, hut has a small duct only, the walls 

 being stolid and muscular. 



The remaining organs do not differ from their usual structure in 

 Aulaco])od ])ulmonates, although the position of the ovotestis is 

 varied in the several genera. 



Muscle.'*. — Only the muscles lying free in the body cavity, not 

 those composing the external walls or sole, will l)e considered herein, 

 the latter being morphologically similar in Arioiiida; to the other 

 land snails. 



The free muscles belong to two groups : (1) retractors of the buc- 

 cal mass, eye-peduncles and tentacles, and (2) retractors of the 

 generative organs. 



The buccal and tentacle retractors, with the foot retractor or re- 

 tractors in ordinary spiral-shelled snails converge and are attached 

 posteriorly or proximally to the columella of the shell. In Limacid 

 or Arionid slugs the degenerate shell no longer serves as a su[)port 

 for these muscles, which are inserted at or near the posterior margin 

 of the diaphragm, or floor of the lung ; this position approximating 

 pretty closely to the posterior or former columellar margin of the 

 vestigial shell. In the more primitive genera, ^inneya, Heviphillia, 

 Ariolhnax, etc., the retractors still converge to a ])oint near the 

 middle of the back margin of the lung, under the posterior edge of 

 the shell (PI. XIV, figs. 65, 66, 67, 69, 71). In the more divergent 

 genera Arlon (PI. XIV, fig. 72) and Prophymon (PI. XIV, fig. 70), 

 the eye and tentacle retractors have moved from the middle to the 

 outer posterior angles of the diaphragm. The convergent retractors 

 of Ariolimax and its allies are a heritage from the spiral-shelled an- 

 cestors of the family, although the utility of the convergence is no 

 longer present ; while the parallel retractors of Arion, etc., are a 

 later modification which resulted in a straight backward pull of 

 each retractor, independent of the others, and possibly brought about 

 mechanically by the tendency toward separation of the grouped 

 proximal insertions by strains on the converging muscles from their 

 separated distal terminations. Another muscle more or lees closely 

 associated with the buccal and tentacle retractor system, is found in 

 Ariolima.r, Hemphillia and allied genera (PI. XIV, figs. 65, 60, 69). 

 This is a band passing from near the proximal insertions of buccal 

 and eye retractors forward across the diaphragm to an insertion in 

 the top or right side of the head. It has been termed the " reten- 

 sor " bv Simroth, who observed it m Ariolimax Californicvs, and 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPPITA. 225 



siipjioscd it to be an aid to the extension of the penis. We scarcely 

 endorse this view of its function, after observing it in several other 

 genera in which it is not inserted near tlie atrium, but in tlie integ- 

 ument of the head or back above. It may aid in withdrawing the 

 head beneath the mantle. Morphologically this muscle is regarded 

 by Simroth as a slip detached from the body-wall. In this, again, 

 we are compelled to dissent. We regard it as a retractor pedis, the 

 anterior insertion of which has moved from the sole to the side or 

 upj)er integument. Pending further investigation into its physiolo- 

 gic function and morphologic equivalency, we continue to use Sim- 

 roth's name " retensor" for this muscle. 



The retractors of the genitalia are far less constant in forni, num- 

 ber and ()Ositi<>n than those of the buccal mass and eyes. Their 

 proximal insertions here, as in the spiral snails, are on the diaphragm 

 or lung floor. The chief muscles of this .system are the penis retrac- 

 tor (PI. XIV, figs. 66, 71 r.p.), which is almost invariably inserted 

 ou the left side of the diaphragm, and the oviduct rctractdrs (Pi. 

 XIV, fig. 67, vag. r.), which may be inserted either upon the 

 dia[)hragm or at its posterior border. The latter are well developed 

 only in those genera in which the oviduct or vagina has a.ssunied 

 the function of a penis. In Arion and Geomalucus the spern)utheca 

 duct also has a retractor. The several retractors of the female or- 

 gans are quite inconstant in position and number (being often in- 

 creiiHcd by splitting). They are not houjologous with the ])eni8 re- 

 tractor, but have been developed <lr noro in the genera requiring 

 them. 



Another muscle deserving mention is a short band uniting the 

 swollen epiphallus to its jx-duncle, in the genus J'roplnpauu (PI. 

 XIII, fig. 57, 111 nee). 'l'\\\> muscle so conceals the true structure of 

 ba>e of the epiphallus that no former authors with the exception of 

 8imroth, have correctly described or represent«il it. 



I'al Hal region. — Underlying'' the retractor muscle system is seen 

 a thin but dense membrane |)erforated only by the aorta and the 

 rectum. This is the "diaphragm" separaliiiL' tin? body cavity iVoin 

 that of the lung (indicated in outline in the fi inures on IM. X\'). 

 Removing the diajdiragra, the inner surface of the lung is exposed, 

 densely reticulated with blood ve.«sels (PI. XV, fig. 73). The breath- 

 ing pore or pulmonary aperture (PI. XV, fig. 77, p. a.) is gituated at

the middle of the right margin of the lung cavity in some genera 

 {Ariolimax, Aphallarinn, Hesperario)i), at the right anterior angle 

 in others (Arion, Prophijsaon). The rectum lies along the right side, 

 posteriorly, and opens at the breathing pore (PI. XV, figs. 73, etc., 

 r). Lying in the lung cavity, and often almost filling it, is the kid- 

 ney (PI. XV, figs. 76, 77, 80, etc., k). It is rounded or squarish in 

 shape, thick, and attached t)y its upper side'" to the roof of the lung 

 cavity around the heart and toward its j)osterior side. The kidney 

 appears variously striated or shows branching ducts (as in PI. XV, 

 fig. 74). Its secretion is voided through a slender duct tlie (second- 

 ary ureter, PI. XV, u. r) emerging posteriorly toward the right 

 side, running parallel to the rectum, and opening near the edge of 

 the breathing pore. The characters of the ureter are insufficiently 

 shown in the figures. Behind the middle of the kidney there is an 

 excavation perforating it, occupied by the heart (PI. XV, a. v.). In 

 some genera both chambers of the heart are exposed below ; in 

 others only the ventricle. Only in Aphallarion are both auricle 

 and ventricle concealed by a thin outer layer of the kidney. We 

 have occasionally observed a portion of the kidney protruded 

 tongue-like from the breathing {)ore in drowned specimens of large 

 species. The morphology of these organs is not greatly varied 

 among the genera of Arionidre, and need not be farther considered 

 here. In defining the families of Pulmonata, these organs give 

 characters of great value. 



II. CLASSIFICATION. 



The generic characters of slugs in general, and of Arionidae in 

 particular, as given in the standard manuals and faiinal monographs, 

 are of the most superficial character. With a single conspicuous, 

 exception," we do not know of any writer who has given evidence of 

 much insight into or comprelionsion of the meaning of the varied 

 internal structure of slugs, or who has even suggested a i)hylogenetic 

 arrangement ot the genera of Arionidie. 



The complete classification of this and related families cannot be 

 presented here without unduly extending the limits of this paper by 

 including inforuiation upon the Old World genera; but so far as 

 the Arionidie are concerned, the essential outlines may be gathered 



"Or, as the preparation lies, its lower side.

The chief differences between Binneya and Xanthonyx Beem to be 

 that in Binneya the nepionic shell is spirally lirate, in Xanthonyx 

 radially plicate ; in Xanthonyx there is a small caudal horn, in 

 Binneya none; and there are certain discrepancies in the details of 

 genitalia as described by Binney, Crosse and Fischer, and Strebel 

 and Pfeffer. These may, perhaps, be in part merely sj)ecific varia- 

 tions, and in part errors of observation. On accountof the sexually 

 immature condition of our specimens we unfortunately cannot verify 

 the published accounts. The description of the anatomy of Xan- 

 thonyx Salleanua given by Strebel and Pfeffer seems to be worthy 

 of confidence. 



Binneya agrees with Hemphillia in the solid tail, the viscera being 

 crowded forward into the dorsal hump; in the exposed shell, short 

 and simple gut; the general arrangement of muscles, especially the 

 possession of a " retensor " ; in the well developed penis, and general 

 system of external reticulation. It differs from Hemphillia mainly 

 in the better developed spiral shell, the differently placed retensor 

 muscle and penis retractor, the presence of an appendicula, and the 

 distinctly tripartite sole. That the two genera are closely allied is 

 80 obvious as to justify the supposition that Honphillia descended 

 from a slug very similar to the existing Binneya. 



Cryptostrakon W. G. B. is probably allied to Binneya, but the

Muscle system Ariolimacine, the eye and buccal retractors con- 

 verging posteriorly, contiguous at their proximal insertioijs; buccal 

 retractor spreading where it enters buccal mass, not bifurcate. A 

 broad " retensor " muscle arises at the posterior margin of diaj)hragm 

 just left of the retractor insertions, and runs forward a.< far as tlie 

 front insertion of the mantle (PI. XIV, fig. 69, ret.). Penis retrac- 

 tor inserted proximally on the ventral face of the retensor. Right 

 eye retractor passing between male and female branches of the 

 genitalia. 



Lung radially striate rather than reticulate. Kidney a broad 

 squarish leaf, free for the greater part, adnate dorsally around the 

 heart, (PL XV, fig. 78). 



Distribution : Oregon, Washington and western Idaho. 



JJemphillia shares with all Ariolimaeiiice the primitive arrange- 

 ment of the retractor system. Like aU of this subfamily except 

 Hesperarion it possesses that anomalous muscle called by Simroth 

 the " retensor," which we hold to be a modified retractor pedis. 



Apart from these important characteristics of the musculature, 

 there are profound diflferences from Ariolimax and its allies : the 

 viscera are crowded forward and upward into a visceral hump under 

 the mantle, behind which the foot is solid, as in the spiral-shelled 

 snails; the shell is comparatively large and imbedded only at the 

 edges in the mantle, which expo.ses a considerable part of it ; and 

 the intestinal tract, while fundamentally of the same type, is con- 

 siderably shortened and simplified. 



In all of these dejjartures from the normal slug structure, Hemp- 

 hillia is akin to Binneya; but it is a more advanced evolution-pro- 

 duct, in that it has lost the spiral torsion of the visceral mass and 

 shell, still retained by Binneya as a reminiscence of long i)ast ances- 

 tors. 



Among the secondary characters separating Hemphillid from 

 Binneya may be mentioned the tripartite sole, narrow foot margin, 

 and .small mantle lobes oi Binneya, the other genus having no divis- 

 ion of the sole, no mantle lobes and a wide foot margin. Internally,

Biiineya has an appeiitlicula, the penis retractor is inserted on the 

 lung flour, and tlie retensor muscle is weak, while in Hemphillia 

 there is no appeudicula and the penis retractor is inserted on the 

 surface of the very broad and stronor retensor. The digestive tract 

 is considerably alike in the two genera. 



Key to species of Hemphillia.

Part of several of the references given above apply to H. came- 

 lus, Mr. Binney having included that species in glandiilosa. The 

 latter is herein restricted to slugs with papillose mantle and caudal 

 horn, as originally indicated by Bland and Binney. 



Besides the conpsicuous external differences noticed under H. 

 camelus, the two species differ markedly in the genitalia. In H. 

 gkindulosa the fleshy process in the penis is bifid and attached to 

 the side at the apex of the cavity. In H. camelus the process is 

 simple and attached basally. The position of the penis-retractor 

 and the shape of the spermatheca and its duct differ in the two 

 forms.

Color in alcohol pale grayish-bufi', closely speckled and maculated 

 with blackish on the mantle and tail, more sparsely and lightly so 

 on the anterior half of the foot, the sole without dark markings. 

 Ou the mantle the spots form two more or less distinct longitudinal 

 bands. Surface of the mantle somewhat rugose, not papillate; 

 breathing pore liehind the middle. Genital opening near right 

 tentacle. Foot with a short dorsal groove behind mantle, obliquely 

 descending grooves with sparse reticulation on the sides of tail, and 

 coarse reticulation below mantle laterally ; the head longitudinally 

 closely grooved and reticulate ; sole as in H. glandulona; tail some- 

 what keeled above near the end, without any appearance of a cau- 

 dal " horn." Foot-margin wide, grooved vertically ; pedal furrows 

 abruptly and conspicuously rising at the tail, with no noticeable 

 caudal pore at their union, at least in alcoholic examples, but in one 

 specimen there seems to be a transverse slit under the pedal groove, 

 with a vertical gutter below it, T-shaped. In another, nothing of 

 this appears. Length about 28 mm.

 in H. glandulosa, and the retractor muscle is inserted at its root. 

 Spermatbeca small, its duct very stout, inserted upon the atrium.

 it, and the genitalia diflTer in important respects, as noticed under 

 the description of H. glandulosa.

To the generic characters described and implied in our former 

 pai)er, the following may be added : 



Tail gland (PI. XV, fig. 81) a peculiar triangular mass of tissue, in 

 alcoholic specimens deej)ly fissured transversely. 



Muscle system (PI. XIV, fig. G6, A. columbianus) having the 

 buccal and eye retractors converging posteriorly, their proximal in- 

 sertions contiguous at the posterior edge of the diaphragm. Buc- 

 cal retractor very deeply bifurcate. An accessory muscle, the 

 " retensor," arises with the retractor grouj), to the left of the median 

 .line, and j)a.<sing forward is inserted in the integument of the neck, 

 on the right side or above. 



Lung (PI. XV, fig. 73, A. cohimbianus, the kidney removed) and 

 kidney (PI. XV, fig. 74, A. colnmlnanuK) as usual in ArionidoE. 

 Auricle concealed by kidney, ventricle (fig. 73, 74, v) exposed. 



Subsequent studies support the conclusion reached in our former 

 paper, that Ariolhwix is more closely allied to Aphallarion than to 

 any other known genus. 



<icnu< APHALLARION I'ilabry k Vnnntta, 1800. 

 Aphallarion P. tVt V., Proc. .Vcad. N. S. Phila., ISW, p. 348.

Muscle system (PI. XIV, fig. 67) substantially like Arxolimax in 

 arrangement of the buccal and eye retractors, except that the right

eye retractor is not involved between tlie S and 9 branches of 

 genitalia; "retensor" inserted nearer the median line anteriorly. 

 Penis retractor wanting, but several vaginal retractors (fig. 07, 

 vag. r.) nr'x^e from the diaphragm. 



Pallial region as in Ariolimax, except that the kidney is larger, 

 and both auricle and ventricle are concealed therein (PI. XV, fig. 

 76). 



Aphallarioii is intimately related to Ariolimax, from which it dif- 

 fers in the absence of a penis and its retractor, in having the right 

 eye retractor free from and to the left of the genitalia, and in hav- 

 ing both chambers of the lieait end)edded in the kidney. No other 

 genua is nearly allied. 



To our former account it may be added that Mr. Wetherby in- 

 forms us that his Ariolimax Hecoxi from Santa Cruz is specifically 

 the same as our A. Buttoni. As he remembers the genital system, 

 it corresponded with that of our sjDccies. Since A. Hecoxi was not 

 described, this will in no way affect nomenclature, but is of interest 

 as removing a doubtful species from slug literature, and extending 

 the geographic range of Aphallarion. 



Genus HESPERARION .Simioth, 1891. 



Hesperarion Simroth, Malak. Blatter (n. F. ) XI, Heft 2, p. 109. Type 

 Ariolimax niger Coop. 



Slugs with the usual small, anterior, shield-like mantle, completely 

 buried, non-spiral shell plate, and long body-cavity excavated to 

 end of tail. Breathing pore somewhat behind middle of right 

 mantle edge. Genital orifice distant from tentacle, below the ante- 

 rior margin of mantle. Foot with longitudinal grooves, becoming 

 oblique on the sides, the foot margin moderate, pedal furrows deep, 

 meeting in a very conspicuous, subtriangular, posteriorly guttered 

 tail pit. Sole rather indistinctly tripartite, the areas not defined by 

 longitudinal grooves. Jaw with coarse rilis. 



Radula with the usual tricuspid central and bicuspid lateral 

 teeth, ectocones small ; marginals with very long, oblique cusps, the 

 ectocone minute or vestigial. 



Intestinal tract (PI. XI, fig. 33) much as in Ariolimax. G' in- 

 distinctly divided int(j crop and stomach, making a half revolutic^n ; 

 G^ describing a complete revolution in the opposite direction, G'

Genital system (PI. XII, figs. 44-48) having a well develoj)ed 

 peuis with terminal retractor and epiphallus, lumen with plicate 

 walls (fig. 45), and a large apical penis papilla (figs. 45, 46). 

 Atrium hearing a vermiform appendiciila with swollen base (fig. 44 

 ap ; fig. 47, ap). Spermatheca borne on a short, hasally swollen duct. 

 Spermatophores (fig. 43, x H) cbitinous, elongate, with flagellum- 

 like extension at one end. Ovotestis separated from albumen gland, 

 lying on the right side under G\ to the right of posterior end of 

 stomach (PI. XI, fig. 33, ot.). 



Muscle system (PI. XIV, fig. 71) Ariolimacine in having the re- 

 tractors converging posteriorly, their proximal insertions contigu- 

 ous ; buccal retractor deeply bifurcate. Xo " retensor." Penis 

 retractor short, broad, inserted in the left anterior portion of the 

 lung floor or diaphragm (fig. 71, r. p.). 



Lung as usual ; kidney very large (PI. XV, fig. 77, h). Only the 

 ventricle exposed. 



Distribution : Middle portion of California, in the counties lying 

 near and below San Francisco Bay, west of the Sierra Nevada. 



Externally He^perarion is like Ariolimox and Ajihallarion except 

 in the structure of the caudal pore, which is a deej), open i)it in this 

 genus, while in the others it is filled by a mass of spongy tissue. 

 The jaw, teeth, intestine, pallial region and musculature of the 

 three genera are practically identical in their main features, except 

 that Hesperarion totally lacks a " retensor" muscle. 



In the genitalia are found further im[)ortant diflTerences. The 

 ovotestis is not packed adjacent to the albumen gland anteriorly, us 

 in Arioliviaz and Aphnllur'wn, but is carrii-d back to a more pos- 

 terior pf)sition among the hind loops of the intestine, and surrounded 

 by the liver (PI. XI, fig. 33, o^). The penis, externally similiar 

 to that of Arioinnux, is of the usual simple structure, not invagi- 

 nated, and the atrium I)enr3 an enigmatic organ of unknown func- 

 tion, our ignorance of which is veiled behind the term "appcndic- 

 ula."" This is wanting in other Arionidiv with the exception of 

 Binncyn, the most j>rimitive genus of the family. 



The species of Hesjitrnrinn are dimorphic, like Ario/imax colum- 

 biamis, having a spotted and an immaculate form.

The genitalia in two individuals dissected show considerable 

 variation. In one, (PI. XII, fig. 44), the penis is large nearly its 

 entire length, constricted at base; this being from a maculated indi- 

 vidual like PI. IX, figs. 5, 6, from Santa Clara, Cal. In the other, 

 a typical niger in coloring, tlie penis is slender below, swollen 

 above (PI. XII, fig. 47). We hope to receive further specimens 

 and ascertain the limits and significance of variation in tliese 

 organs.

Professor Cockerell defines a color-form maculatus as follows : 

 "This much resembles A. hemphilli var. maculatus, hui is larger 

 and stouter, and has tlie lateral areas of the sole marbled as in 

 niger. Two specimens were received from Dr. Cooi)er, who found 

 them at Haywards, Cal." The maculated form is shown in our 

 figures. It seems more abundant than the spotless slug, but in our 

 series it is difficult to separate the two, as some which appear spot- 

 less often show a few maculie enclose examination.

Since its first publication in 1875, nothing material has been 

 added to our knowledge of this species. Its generic position is un- 

 certain. The desirability of procuring additional specimens in 

 order to place the form upon a better ba.'iis will be evident. The 

 type locality is Niles Station, Alameda Co., California. 



Professor Cockerell's color-form maculatus has been figured in 

 Binney's Third Supplement, but not before described. "Small 

 spotted hemjthilli found by Dr. Cooper at Haywiirds. When alive, 

 as I learn from Dr. Cooper, they are reddish, the spotted variety of 

 niger being gray ; in alcoiiol, both appear gray. They agree with 

 liemphilli W. G. B. in the gtMiitalia, and difler also from niger in 

 their n)ore slender form and immaculate sole of foot. Indeed, com- 

 paring them with ty[)ical niger, they appear fundamentally distinct 

 in every way, but the var. maculatus of niger is .strangely interme-

Conspicuous in the P^uropeau fauna for the number of species 

 and individuals, and for the large size and frecpiently l)rilliant col-

 tion. They have not yet exhibited the tentlency to spread (.-harac-

 figured, with the retractor system and jtallial organs. As preserved 

 they measure 15 to 20 mm. in length ; ground-color above dirty 

 whitisl), with a. conspicuous blackish stripe along each side of mantle 

 and of the foot behind it, the back with a broad median bluish or 

 slate-black band, tapering posteriorly, often only faintly indicated ; 

 sole light yellow. 



In other specimens from roughkee])i^ie, N. Y., the region between 

 the longitudinal black bands on mantle and sides is speckled and 

 maculated with black. 



As this species is an immigrant from Euroj)e, where it is well 

 known and has been repeatedly investigated anatomically, we omit 

 a detailed description and synonymy. The coarsely, longitudinally 

 rugose integument, anterior position of the breathing orifice, and 

 posterior position of the genital orifice, below the other, readily dis- 

 tinguish Avion from all native American slugs.

W. G. Binney describes a slug referred by him to Arion ftiscus 

 Miiller, from Boston, Mass. Mr. Cockerell considers it likely that 

 the figure in Terrestrial Mollusks, PI. LXIV, fig. 1, (copied in Man. 

 Amer. L. Shells, fig. 502) represents A. subfuscus. Whether more 

 than one species of ylrio?* occurs in America will remain doubtful 

 until further examination of the Bostonian slug can be made.

 tig. 32, P.fo/iolatum, and fig. 34, P. fasclatuvi) with four well devel- 

 oped sigmoid folds; no division of G' into crop and stomach ; ante- 

 rior loop formed by G* and G' twisted one-half revolution ; poste- 

 rior loop of G' and G* long, extending far behind stomach, and 

 twisted less than a com[)lete revolution. 



Genital system (PI. XII, figs. 37-40, and PI. XIII, all figs.) 

 not crowded forward ; no penis nor retractor ; epiphallus either 

 very stout, cylindrical and fleshy, with minute perforation, or more 

 slender, long and tapering distally ; in either case suddenly narrow- 

 ing near the atrium to a minute duct, which enters the atrium by a 

 short tapering peduncle, in close contact with which the enlarged 

 epiphallus is held by a mu.-cle (seen in fig. 57 of PI. XIII, inusc, and 

 fig. 3!i of PI. XII). Duct of spermatheca short ; spermatophores as 

 in IIe-'<peraru)ii. Ovote.stis (PI. XI, fig. 34) lying anterior to the

 retractor in.^erted at the posterior edge of diaphragm to the right of 

 the middle, bifurcate distally. Right eye retractor pas-ing between 

 branches of genitalia. 



Pallial region (PI. XV, fig. 80) much as in Arion ; breathing

ProjilniHfion stands rather isolated in the Arioiiiua:. The only 

 native American genus approaching it is Auadeuulu^, l)ut this diflers 

 in several important particulars to be mentioned below. The Palfe- 

 arctic Arion is like Projiln/mon in the pallial region, but diflers 

 markedly in (1) the removal of the l>uccal retractor insertion back-

ward from tlie diaphragm edge, (2) the complex twiBting of the gut 

 and the posterior position of the stomach (see these Proceedings, 1896, 

 pi. 13, f. 3) ;(3) the simpler form of theepiphallus, and well developed 

 retractor muscles of vagina and spermatheca, and (4) the normally 

 constructed tail. There are various other minor differences ; but upon 

 the wiiole, the American genus is less divergent than the European 

 from the primitive forms of the family in its musculature, more diver- 

 gent in the tail structure and epiphallus. In Arion, shell reduction 

 has progressed rather further, at least in the typical forms. Geoma- 

 lacus, a lateral branch from the ArioJi stem, is even more remote from 

 the American genus. The Himalayan genus Avadenus (with which 

 Fischer unites Projihysaon as a subgenus), differs conspicuously in 

 possessing a well developed penis with retractor, and externally in 

 the extreme narrowness of the foot margin and the tripartite sole. 



The selfaminitation of the tail in Prophysaon has been described 

 by Henry Hemphill'^ and W. J. Raymond ;'* while Simroth has 

 noticed and figured the ai)pearance of the tail in alcoholic specimens 

 before amputation. 



Mr. Raymond writes as follows: " In August, 1888, I collected 

 on one occasion about a dozen examples of Prophysaon Anderi-oni 

 J. G. Cp., near the San Jos6 reservoir, above Lexington, Santa 

 Clara County. While taking measurements of the living specimens, 

 before putting them into alcohol, I noticed in several a contraction 

 about two-thirds of the length from the head. This appeared as an 

 indented line completely encircling the body. Upon handling the 

 slugs to examine this phenomenon more closely, the line became 

 deeper and in the case of two of the specimens the tail dropped off, 

 almost as readily as the ray of the so-called ' brittle' starfish." 



Nearly all full grown alcoholic specimens of P. Andersoni , folio- 

 latum and coerulenm show a well defined impressed line around the 

 tail, or occasionally the tail has actually been amputated, as in the 

 specimen of the last-named species figured on Plate IX, figs. 7 to 11. 

 Dissection shows that the body cavity does not extend beyond the 

 point of excision, or but little beyond ; the remainder of the tail 

 being occupied by very spongy vesicular connective tissue. 



We have not seen Prophysaon alive, and observations are still 

 lacking upon some interesting jioints which could probably be sup-

plied by keeping slugs in captivity. Does regeneration of the lost 

 member take place, and if so, is the renewed tail structurally like 

 the amputated one, or does loss of the tail result eventually in 

 death ? What animals persecute Pro/i/i^saon.^ Observations upon 

 these questions might go a long way toward explaining the present 

 utility of tail amputation, though they may not indicate the mode 

 of its origin. Without knowledge of the final consquences of am- 

 putation to the slug, or what its natural enemies are, speculation 

 upon tail excision is idle. In an analogous case now well known, 

 that of Helicarion in the Philij)pine Islands, Sem()er'^ states that 

 every species he examined "possessed the singular property, which 

 many lizards have — particularly the Geckos — of shedding their tail 

 when they are seized somewhat roughly at a little way behind the 

 shell. This they do by whisking tlie tail up and down with extra- 

 ordinary raj)idity, almost convulsively, till it drops off; if the creat- 

 ure is held by the tail, it immediately falls to the ground, where it 

 easily hides among the leaves. If it is laid flat on tlie hand, the 

 rapid wagging movement is strong enough to raise the body witii a 

 spring into the air, so that it falls over on to the ground. These 

 snails at first constantly esca])e(l mc and my collector.-; in this way, 

 and not unfrequentiy we had nothing but the tail left in our hands. 

 According to Guilding's ol)Hervations the same peculiarity of part- 

 ing with the hinder prolongation of the foot characterizes the West 

 Indian snail Stetiopus. I ascertained by further investigation that 

 in a free state of nature such self-mutilation not unfrequentiy occurs, 

 for about a hundred specimens of Helicarion gutta, which is ex- 

 tremely common in the north-east of Luzon, I found, perhaps, ti-n in- 

 dividuals that had shed tlicir tails, or, to speak more accurately, the 

 hinder end of the foot, and had the .stumps partly healed, or the foot 

 to some extent grown again. Now, this hinder portion of the foot 

 is the most conspicuous part of the .^nail's body, and it may be sup- 

 posed that it is, in most cases, the part first seized by the reptiles or 

 birds that prey upon them ; i)Ut, startled by the escape of the body, 

 they would soon learn to recognize;, by the form of the tail, those 

 species which were cajjable, by tliis self-amputaii<jn, of depriving 

 them of the larger an«i probably the only valuable portion of the 

 j)rey. In this way the species of the genus Hrliatrinn can escape 

 the pursuit of their enemies better than they otherwise could on 

 account of their exposed mode of life,"

Whether Sempei's plausible suj)position be held to suflficiently ex- 

 plain the self-mutilation of Helicarion or not, it .seems to us that the 

 slowness of the process of amputation in Prophysaoii, precludes the 

 idea that it is a means of escape from birds, which, in any case, are 

 as likely to seize the slug by the head or middle as by the tail. If 

 molluscan foes are in question, the time consumed in am])utation is 

 of less moment; and it mi^ht be worth while to imprison Prophys- 

 aon with Circinaria {alias Selenites and Macrocydis), which is the 

 most rapacious snail of the West Coast. The suggestion is offered 

 for what it may be worth ; and the whole suliject referred to the 

 enter])risiug and enthusiastic naturalists of the West for ob.servation 

 and experiment. 



The species of Prophysaon fall into three very distinct groups, 

 two of them containing but one species each, the other including P. 

 Andtrsoni Coop, {plus Hemphiili B. & B., Pacificum and flavum 

 Ckll.), and P. foliolatum Gld. (including Phenacarlon Hemphiili W. 

 G. B.). As the synonymy indicates, these two species are excessively 

 variable. In the case of Andersoni a great extent of territory is in- 

 habited by the several forms and typical form of the species, and 

 much more extensive series than we have yet seen must be brought 

 together before a final decision upon the limits of variation, and the 

 definable subspecies if any exist, can be made. Our study of them 

 is based wholly upon alcoholic slugs, gathered from localities hun- 

 dreds of miles apart; and it is to be expected that richer collections 

 may modify, and certainly will amplify, the conclusions reached. 



Our general results so far as synonymy is concerned, do not differ 

 radically from those attained by Professor Cockerell, whose synopsis 

 of the species is given below.'®

length in alcohol 25-35 mm. Upi)er surface buff-gray or whit- 

 ish flesh colored, with irregular blackish diamond venation and 

 sometimes suffused with purplisjli-black, showing a j)ale dorsal line; 

 the mantle yellowish, with two curved lateral black stripes, with or 

 without scattered marbling; sole pale buff or dirty white ; foot mar- 

 gin pale ; below and anterior to mantle whitish. Integument with 

 rather coarse diamond veiiiition, the areolae subdivided into minute 

 polygonal granules. 



Shell oval, with moderately consistent calcareous layer. 



Genitalia (PL XIII, figs. 59, 60, 61): Epiphallus cylindric, 

 straight or sometimes curved, with an abrupt basal constriction, 

 kink and peduncle secured by a short muscle, as deijcribed above. 

 Vas deferens very long, its length measured from end to the abrupt 

 bend at the atrium being about 7 times the length of the epiphallus ; 

 thrown into a complicated snarl. Spermatheca globose or oval, on 

 a rather slender duct. Vagina long. Free oviduct short. Ovotestis 

 showing externally a compact mass of rounded follicles. Right 

 eye retractor passing between branches of genitalia. 



Measurements of .several specimens are as follows: a (INIus. no. 

 69,010, Oakland, Cal.), length of swollen epiphallus 9 mm. ; length 

 of extended vas deferens, from apex of the epiphallus to base of

 about 15 well-defined ribs, denticulating the basal margin. 



Radula with 44-1-44 teeth ; rachidian tricuspid, laterals bicuspid, 

 the ectocones quite small ; marginals with moderately long, pointed 

 mesocones and minute ectocones (PI. XVI, fig. 93, two outer lateral, 

 and a group of marginal teeth).

dirty buff, or yellow, variously marked. Very rarely the two 

 curved black stripes on the mantle are wanting, and occasional 

 specimens fail to show the pale dorsal line, which in others is very 

 conspicuous. We fail, however, to find internal characters permit- 

 ting the division of our series into several species; and while it is 

 possible that some of the named forms may be geographic subspecies, 

 we are disposed to regard them rather as local variations of but 

 slight rank and uncertain diagnosis. Large series from many local- 

 ities must be collected and compared to define the subspecies, if any 

 exist. 



It differs chiefly from P. foliolatum in being smaller, with very 

 .much shorter " amjjutateable " tail segment, and in dentition. 



Simroth found a very long, smooth, vermiform spermatophore in

 couver Island ( Wickham, Taylor); Old Mission, Lake Ca?ur d'Alene, 

 Idaho (Hemphill). 



There is considerable variation in the shape and size of the epi- 

 phallus, even among specimens of similar size and external appear- 

 ance, collected at the same time at one locality. Thus, in one spec- 

 imen of a small series from San Juan Island, tlie epiphallus is 4* 

 mm. long, and straight (fig. 61) ; while in another it measures 7 mm. 

 and is curved (fig. 59). The extremes in a larger series from Oak- 

 land, Cal., are: shortest, 5 uira. long, straight ; longest 8 mm. long, 

 curved. After vainly trying to correlate the variations of the 

 epiphallus with other characters, with a view to defining two or more 

 species, we are compelled to conclude that they are largely individ- 

 ual, possibly to some extent functional, but that these variations are 

 not in any sense characteristic of races or species. Of course the 

 observations were made upon sexually mature individuals."

 There are all possible intergradations between the ochreous and

In P. pacificmn we fail to see any specific characters. The color- 

 ation agrees well with specimens of undoubted P. Anden^oni from 

 Washington, and neither the measurements nor the dentition offer 

 differential characters, so far as we can see. The types were col- 

 lected by Mr. Wickham, near Victoria, Vancouver Island.

Length (in alcohol) 50-80 mm. Rather slender, the posterior 

 third (or more) often distinctly more attenuated, defined by an ob- 

 lique groove. Mantle oblong, its length contained 25 to 'd\ times in 

 the total length of body, the breathing orifice decidedly in front of 

 the middle. Foot margin rather wide; wrinkles of the sole corres- 

 ponding to vertical grooves of the foot margin", bending backward 

 and meeting in the middle ; pedal groove deep, with no noticeable 

 caudal pore. 



Colors variable: (1) Back clear reddish-fawn with a lighter dor- 

 sal band, sometimes obsolete, the mantle with the usual two curved 

 black lateral stripes, with or without scattered maculpe; becoming 

 paler, light yellowish on the sides and sole; or (2) back reddi.^h, 

 suffu.sed with black, mantle bands long, often with a third median 

 band and scattered maculse, foot with the principal veins of the 

 reticulation black-pigmented, as are alternate grooves of the foot 

 margin ; sides paler, gray; sole yellowish. 



Surface with deeper oblique grooves connected by short longi- 

 tudinal grooves to form a roughly diamond-shaped reticulation, the 

 meshes of which are minutely subdivided. 



Shell very delicate, membranous, with a thin and incoherent 

 layer of calcareous granules.

Jaw (PI. XVI, fig. 98) strong, opaque, with 8-14 wide flattened 

 ribs. 



Radula with 44-1-44 teeth. Centrals tricuspid, laterals bicus- 

 pid, the ectocones small. Marginals formed by shortening of the 

 basal-plates, having the niesocone short, ectocone simple or on some 

 teeth bifid rPl. XVI, fig. 90). 



Epiphallus stout, cylindric, curved, with the usual constriction, 

 peduncle and muscle at base. Vas deferens extremely long, elabor- 

 ately twisted and tangled. Vagina long, the spermatheca duct 

 about as long as the spermatheca. Albumen gland very large, long 

 and tongue-shaped. Ovo-testis a very compact mass showing exter- 

 nally only the rounded-polygonal ends of the closely packed folli- 

 cles. In two typical individuals from Seattle (Mus. no. 71,072) the 

 measurements are: a (fig. 55), length of swollen epiphallus 12.5 

 mm., of extended vas deferens from summit of epiphallus to base of 

 san)e 92 mm. ; of albumen gland 28 mm. ; length of animal 80 mm. 

 b (tig. 57), length of epiphallus 14 mm.; of vas deferens 114 mm. 

 The ratio of length of epiphallus to that of vas deferens as measured 

 above is about 1:7^ or 8. The original of fig. 58 is a small speci- 

 men, perhaps not fully adult. 



Type locality, Discovery Harbor, Puget Sound (Pickering). Also 

 occurs at Olympia (Hemphill), Seattle (Hemphill, Randolph), and 

 doubtless throughout the Puget Sound region generally. 



P. joHolatnm is very closely allied to P. Andersoni Coop. It is 

 larger, more elongated, with the solid portion of the tail, or that sub- 

 ject to am[)utation, longer in proportion than \n Ander-'fnii. In 

 living sf)ecimen8 a mucous pore is visible at the tail, but this is not 

 noticeable externally in alc(»holic examples. The light dorsal line 

 is occasionally indistinguishable. 



The jaw forms proI)ably intergrade with P. Anderxinti ; imt the 

 teeth differ quite perceptibly in the shorter, blunter cusps of the 

 outer laterals and inner marginals. This is one of the best specific 

 characters. 



The form described by Binney as Phenacnrion Hemphilli does 

 not seem to offer sufficiently tangible p(iint8 of diflference from folio- 

 latnm to stand as n species, even were the name not i)reoccu[)ied. 

 It is said to be " more slender and more pointed at the tail than 

 foliokUu*. The body is a bright yellow with bluish-black reticula- 

 tions. The edge of the foot and the foot itself are almost black. 

 Shield irregularly mottled with fuscous. The body also is irregu-

larly mottled witli fuscous, and lias one broad fuscous band down 

 tlie center of the back, spreading as it joins the mantle, with a nar- 

 rower band on each side of the body. It loses its color on being 

 placed in spirits, becoming a uniform dull slate color. Mantle 

 lengthened oval. Shell-plate represented by a group of calcareous 

 grains concealed in the mantle ; it is impossible to remove it as one 

 shell-plate. A decided caudal pore." The jaw and dentition are 

 as in foliolatiim. Genitalia much as in foliolatum, but Binney found 

 the albumen gland to be much shorter, less tongue-shaped and 

 brown-tip])ed. The epiphallus tapers distally, instead of contract- 

 ing abruptly. 



Localities: Gray's Harbor and Chehalis, Washington. 



The only characters of importance are the dorsal band, which 

 seems to be similar to P. fasciafum, and the tapering epiphallus, also 

 a character of that species, if not, in this case, an indication of sex- 

 ual immaturity. Mr. Cockerell considers it a synonym of foliolatum ; 

 and, as we have seen no authentic specimen, and the name is, in any 

 case, preoccupied, we consider it best to leave the form as a syno- 

 nym oi foliolatum, pending further information. 



In a series from Cascade Springs, on the Columbia River near 

 the Government locks, collected in October, 1897 by Mr. J. G. 

 Malone, (PI. XIII, fig. 54) the epiphallus is shorter, not curved, the 

 vas deferens also much shorter. The spermatheca is sul)globular. 

 Measurements: length of epiphallus 8.6 mm.; of extended vas 

 deferens from apex of the epiphallus to the abrupt curve at base of 

 same, 42 mm. ; of albumen gland 13 mm. ; length of animal 50 mm. 

 As measured al)ove, the epiphallus is about one-fifth the length of 

 the vas deferens. In typical foliolatum it is about one-eighth, in 

 Andersoni one-seventh. These specimens are (in alcohol) less ver- 

 miform than typical foliolatum, with paler color, back including 

 shield, reddish, fading on the sides ; mantle striped as usual, but 

 blackish stripes defining the dorsal pale stripe either very faint or 

 lacking, so that in some individuals no pale dorsal line is visible. 



Thejaw in this form (PI. XVI, fig. 89) resembles that of P. Ander- 

 soni in the numerous ribs. Radula with long, pointed mesocones on 

 outer lateral and inner marginal teeth, as in P. Andersoni. In 

 typical P. foliolatns the corresponding teeth are shorter and blunter. 



This will probably prove to be a distinct subspecies, and re- 

 ferable to P. Andersoni rather than to foliolatum.

We do not consider P. hwnile^' specifically distinct from fasciatum. 

 The coloration, genitalia and teeth are practically identical, and the 

 character of the jaw (PI. XVI, fig. 97) does not .seem to be constant. 

 Several specimens selected at random from our series of fasciatum 

 from Seattle have a jaw neither plaited or ribbed, but densely, 

 irregularly striated. AVe cannot find any other differences between 

 these specimens and the ordinary fasciatum with flat-ribbed or 

 plaited jaw. The name humile has precedence over J(/sciahau and 

 if the two forms prove to be, as we think, specifically identical, 

 fasciatum will be reduced to varietal rank.

Found by Mr. .\. I'. Wickham under the bark of rotten logs in the woods 

 around Lake Cour d'Alene, Idaho, 1889.

similarly shaped dark stripe running; backward from the mantle, 

 sometimes well-defined, sometimes faint. Mantle huff or red, with 

 two curved lateral black l)ands (sometimes obsolete) and scattered 

 black maculation or marbling. Hliell rectangularly oblong, 2 or 3 

 mm. long. 



Epiphallus slender, long, and tapering distally, having an abrupt 

 kink at base, secured by a short muscle, as usual in the genus. 

 Vas deferens neither lengthened nor convoluted. Vagina apparently 

 functional as a penis. Spermatheca globose or oval, on a short, stout 

 duct which is directly continued into the vagina. Free oviduct 

 short and slender. Ovotestis a rather loose bunch of oval follicles 

 (fig. 38). Albumen gland unusually hard and brittle. The right 

 eye retractor passes between the branches of genitalia. 



In one specimen (PI. XII, fig. 37) there seems to be a glandular 

 enlargement of one side of the base of the epiphallus with a small 

 tubercle on the other side. This may be pathologic. 



Jaw (PI. XVI, figs. 94-96) arcuate with a slight median projec- 

 tion below, covered with flat, narrow, crowded ribs separated by 

 very narrow, shallow intervals, or with flat, slightly imbricated 

 plaits (or merely densely, irregularly striated vertically in form 

 humile, see above.) 



Radula with 35-1-35 teeth. Centrals tricuspid ; laterals lacking 

 the entocone ; marginals formed by union of ectocone with raesocone 

 and shortening of the basal-plate. The cusps are short throughout. 

 The change from laterals to marginals is so gradual that it is prac- 

 tically impossible to draw a line between them. On some outer 

 marginals the ectocone is bifid. The figure shows a central with 

 one lateral and a group of three inner marginals. 



Well and constantly distinguished from P. Andersont and /o^io- 

 latam externally by the wide, light dorsal area enclosing a darker 

 median stripe, and bounded laterally by blackish bands. Inter- 

 nally, the slender, tapering epiphallus and short vas deferens are 

 even more characteristic. The scarlet color of the back, noticed by 

 Cockerell in some specimens, is not accidental, but of common occur- 

 rence. 



In form the species varies (in alcohol) from a long, vermiform 

 shape to about the contour of P. Andersoni. 



The body-cavity extends nearly to the end of the tail. Self- 

 excision of the tail occurs, but the amputated portion is short, as in 

 P. Andersoni, and the great majority of individuals we have seen 

 show no oblique constriction of the tail.

 longitudinal grooves, which, on the sides, become oldique and more 

 spaced, and more anteriorly they radiate vertically below the man- 

 tle ; transverse grooves uniting the longitudinals comparatively few 

 and shallow. Foot-margin very narrow, a second narrow well- 

 defined sub-margin above it. Tail without caudal pore, frequently 

 self-amputated and leaving a conspicuous longitudinal slit (PI. IX, 

 fig. 7, and figs. 9-11, the excised portion).'" 



Genitalia (PL XIII, fig. 51-53) somewhat as in P. Andersoni. 

 The epi phallus is short ; in one of the original specimens from Olym- 

 pia (PI. XIII, figs. 52, 53) very short, truncated at the ends; in 

 another specimen from Seattle (PI. XIII, fig. 51) it is oblong ; vas 

 deferens tangled, i)ut shorter than in Andersoni. Spermatheca 

 glol)ular, on a rather slender duct, which is short in the Olympian 

 specimen, longer in that from Seattle. 



Radula about a-s in P. faxcminm ; the cusps of outer lateral and 

 inner marginal teeth rather short ; marginals quite wide (PI. XVI, 



Type locality, Olyinpia, Washington (Hemphill). In addition to 

 part of IIeiiii)hiirs original lot, we have received it from Seattle (P.

senihles ArioUmax. The very narrow foot-margin, with an unusu- 

 ally distinct border above, is another distinguishing feature. 



Most of the specimens we have seen have lost the end of the tail 

 by self-ani[)utation, as shown in the figures. When perfect the tail 

 is pointed, with no perceptible mucous j>ore; the longitudinal 

 grooves of the back become irregular near the end of the tail. The 

 color of Portland and Seattle specimens is distinctly blue, l)ut some 

 of the original lot from Olympia, collected about eight years ago, 

 have become brown. Mr. Cockerell thus describes a variegated 

 form which he refers to cceruleum as a variety : — 



"Prophysao)i cceruleum var. dubium. Length (in alcohol) 8 mill. 

 Length of mantle, 4 mill. Distance from posterior end of mantle to 

 end of body 3* mill. Mantle broad, with four bands composed of 

 coalesced black marbling, very irregular in shape, and running 

 together anteriorly. Body dark, tapering. Sole pale, its edges 

 gray. Liver white. With the P. coeruleum is a small dark slug, prob- 

 ably a variety of it, but differing as described above. It will easily 

 be distinguished by its blackish color and the peculiar markings on 

 the mantle." 



There are, in some specimens, very close, fine, superficial im- 

 pressed vertical lines crossing the deeper oblique grooves.

Slugs with the minute, non-spiral shell plate wholly buried; the 

 mantle small, rounded and anterior, with breathing pore median on 

 the right side. Genital orifice below right tentacle. Foot reticu-

 grooves rising slightly at tail, with no caudal pore there; sole dis- 

 tinctly tripartite, the areas separated l)y longitudinal grooves, mid- 

 dle field narrower than side fields (PI. IX, fig. 12). 



Body-cavity extending the entire length. Jaw with about 20 

 wide, flat ribs (Binney). Radula with 20-1-20 teeth, about as in 

 Prophysaon in form. 



Intestinal tract (PI. XI, fig. 35) much as in Prophysaon ; posterior

 median line, shortly bifurcate distally.

No adequate discus.sion of the affinities o{ Anadenulus can he en- 

 tered upon until well-preserved specimens are collected permit- 

 ting an examination of the genitalia. Present information indicates 

 its proximity to Prophysaon, with which Anadenulus VLgv^Qsm the di- 

 gestive tract and musculature. But the voluminous kidney, exposing 

 only the ventricle, the conspicuously tripartite sole, and the appar- 

 ent absence of that peculiar structure of the tail which distinguishes 

 Prophysaon, are all important characters indicating the distinctness 

 of the two genera. 



Turning to Old World genera, we find Arion differing in its tail 

 gland, posteriorly prolonged buccal retractor and complexly twisted 

 intestine. Geomalacus shows the same with still other differences ; 

 and in Anadenu'^ the foot margin is very much narrower, the sole 

 not divided by longitudinal grooves, and the intestine is long and 

 spirally twisted.

IV. IIUIKF DIKKCTIONS FOR COLLKCTINC}, PKK.SERVINO AND 

 EXAMINING SLUG.S." 



In the Northern States the be.st time for collecting slugs is in 

 early spring. l-Vom February to July, most well grown specimens 



*' As many of our American concholo^ristH have not 'collected or Htudied 

 plups especially, we have thnuglit it not Huperfluous to append the folhtwinj? 

 notes on collectiuL' slugs, with roujfli dircclionn for tlu-ir examination. It 

 will reaflily be understood that if the slug to be examined is of very small 

 size, or it is neces-sary to obtain all the data from one or two specimens, more 

 or less radical modifications of the»<e inHtructions must be made. 




256 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



taken will prove to have the reproductive organs fully developed. 

 Autumn and late summer are a somewhat less favorable time, be- 

 cause the young of the year have then attained the full growth of 

 the species, wiiile upon opening them the genitalia are found un- 

 developed. Still, autumn specimens should be collected. Always 

 date each " catch " and keep it separate." 



The best preservative for slugs (and other land mollusks) is alco- 

 hol. Of other pi*eservatives, formalin (formaldehyde) is perhaps the 

 best ; but it is, on the whole, a very unsatisfactory substitute, ren- 

 dering the tissues tough and slippery, difficult to dissect, and gener- 

 ally destroying calcareous organs in time. Formalin 8{)ecimens are, 

 moreover, inferior to alcoholic for histological study. Upon the 

 whole, then, formalin should only be used as a permanent preserva- 

 tive for large slugs, if at all, and then in a three or four p. c. solu- 

 tion. It should.be added, however, that when travelling with limited 

 means of conveyance, it is often convenient to use formalin on ac- 

 count of the economy of carrying it in the commercial strength, to 

 be diluted as occasion arises. Never crowd snails in formalin ; the 

 bulk of the solution should exceed that of the snails six or eight 

 times. 



After collecting slugs they should be drowned by placing in a 

 vessel of water with a lid laid on (not a cork pushed in) to exclude 

 air. Generally twelve hours is a sufficient time, but this depends 

 upon the slugs and the temperature. In hot weather less time is 

 required. Test them by taking one out, touching it with alcohol, 

 and if no retraction takes place they are ready to be transferred to 

 25% alcohol ;" leave in this about twelve hours, then transfer to 

 50%, and after twenty-four hours or more to about 75%, in which 

 they may be permanently kept. 



If formalin is used, the slugs may be placed in the 3 or 4% solu- 

 tion when drowned, and changed to fresh solution after a few days, 

 the first being thrown away. Formalin specimens may at any time 

 be transferred to alcohol, or it may be used with a small percent, of 

 alcohol. 



'- Ofcour.se, for economy of space and alcohol, all the lots of one species 

 may be kept in one jar, each in a separate vial or piece of cheese cloth. 



" Of course, in field work the exact proportion is not vital. In general, it 

 is be*it to use a mi.xtiire of three parts of water to one of alcohol at first, then 

 a half and half mixture, and then the i)ermanent strength. The first and 

 second mixtures may be kept and used re[)eatedly, occasionally adding a 

 little alcohol to keep up the strength. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 257 



To dissect slugs use a small pan, say 4x6x1 i inches, with a layer 

 of blackened wax on the bottom. Only a pair of fine scissors, a 

 pair of fine-pointed tweezers, a small scalpel and a supply of fine 

 pin?, with, of course, the small lens usually carried by naturalists, is 

 necessary. Cut the outer integument across the head and along the 

 left side, pin sole down in the pan, with water enough to cover, open 

 by turning the dorsal integument to the right, and cut the rectum 

 where it enters the back. The digestive tract may then be studied 

 by picking away the liver, and, with ordinary care, the genitalia 

 may be removed and isolated by cutting out a small area around 

 the genital orifice. After observing its insertion, the penis retractor 

 may be cut. 



If specimens are abundant, use another for the examination of the 

 muscles and pallial organs. Open by cutting just above the foot 

 groove all around the body; remove the sole, pin back downward 

 in the dissecting pan and remove the digestive and genital systems, 

 care being taken to break no muscles. The whole retractor system 

 will then be seen, and after study the muscles may be cut and the 

 dia[)hragm carefully removed, disclosing the kidney, heart and 

 lung, as .seen in the figures on Plate XV. 



Use a large slug to begin with, such as Limaxmaxhrnix, the Ario- 

 Uinaces or Ajth'il/arion, and no difficulty not readily overcome will 

 be encountered.

MATERIALS TOWARD A NATURAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE CYLIN- 

 DRELLOID SNAILS. 



BY HENUY A. PII.HIJKY AND E. (i. VANATTA. 



While recording some recent additions to the North American 

 landsnail fauna with the intention of revising the "Check List " of 

 United States hind mollusks publislied in these Procredln.(/s for 

 1889, the attention of the senior author was recalled to the rejection 

 of the generic name Cijlindrella by Messrs. Harris and Burrows in 

 1891, and their substitution of a new name for the group. Upon 

 compiling a list of the generic and subgeneric names which have 

 been applied to species of " Cylindrella," it became obvious that a 

 thorough taxoiiomic revision was urgently needed. In order to as-, 

 certain which of the numerous names should be retained as valid, 

 to place these upon a solid basis, and to reduce the remainder to 

 synonyms, it was found necessary to supplement a review of the lit- 

 erature of the group by an examination of the snails themselves, 

 especially with reference to the radulfe. and the internal characters 

 of the shells, revealed by a study of sections cut to expose the inter- 

 nal columella or axis. This detailed examination has been made 

 chiefly by the junior author of this paper. 



The characters of the radula have been utilized as a basis for 

 classification by Crosse and Fischer in 1870, their paper marking 

 an epoch in the taxonomic history of this family. W. G. Binney 

 has added to our knowledge of this subject upon the lines laid down 

 by the French writers ; and later, Strebel and Pfeffer, in their sug- 

 gestive and original series of papers upon the Mexican fauna, have 

 made important contributions toward a rational classification of the 

 group. There are many other writings bearing upon the nomen- 

 clature of the Cylindrellas, but no others of importance for original 

 facts or views concerning their phylogeny or structure, aside from 

 mere species work. 



The external conchologic characters of the Cylindrellas are well 

 known by the writings of Pfeiflfer, Poey and others, but the modifi- 

 cations of the internal armature have been far less fully elucidated. 

 A portion of Pfeiffer's descriptions mention briefly the internal 

 structure, and some of the plates of the Novitates Conchologicoe 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



and Malakozoologische Blatter represent it ; and Arango, in his 

 Contribucion a la Fauna Malacologica Cabana, notes the internal 

 structure of the Cuban species. Most of these observations, how- 

 ever, are not sufficiently detailed or exact to meet the requirements 

 of the case, now that a classification is based largely upon internal 

 structure ; and our own work is therefore founded wholly upon the 

 study of a series of sections including nearly every species in the 

 collection of the Academy. 



Without entering iuto any elaborate expose or criticism of the 

 work of former authors upon the Cylindrellas, attention should be 

 directed to the contention of Crosse & Fischer^ and later of Fischer' 

 that the series should be distributed between two family groups, the 

 CylindrellidcB and the Pupidie, a conclusion based wholly upon the 

 structure of the teeth and jaws ; the first family having greatly mod- 

 ified teeth and plaited jaw, the second having normal dentition and 

 solid jaw. 



That this splitting of the Cylindrellas into two is an unnatural 

 division, seems to us to be proven by the following considerations : 

 (1) The discovery of completely Cylindrelloid shells (Epirobia) 

 with the " normal " type of teeth. (2) The presence of transition 

 stages in the teeth in the genus Holospira, and (3) the recent dem- 

 onstration by the senior author of this paper* of the rapid changes 

 undergone by the teeth of some genera under the stress of changed 

 habits, without corresponding changes in the rest of the anatomy, 

 as seen in Papuina, Polymita, etc. (4) The general law of change 

 in the structure of the jaw, as illustrated in the families Endodon- 

 iidiB and HeUcido:, must now be recognized as largely discounting 

 the old value placed upon that organ as a factor in systematic mal- 

 acology ; and in any family of snails we may expect to find both 

 the more primitive plaited and the later solid type of jaw. The 

 final reason for rejecting the idea that any of the group under con- 

 sideration are Pupidce, is that none of them, so far as known, possess 

 the extremely characteristic complication of the male genital organs 

 found in Pupa, Buliminu.i, Clausilia, and their immediate allies, and 

 which constitute one of the most important characters of the 

 family Pupidce.

 etc., p. 24, 61. 



Under Helix, Ferussac establishes a " Quatorzi^me sous-genre. 

 Cochlodine, Cochlodina nobis." The subgeneric definition applies 

 better to Clausilia than to the other forms included by Ferussac in the 

 group; and, indeed, seems to be based wholly upon that genus. 



The species of Cochlodina are classified as follows : —

It will l)e seen that Cwc/i/o(///ta is a miscellaneous group, including 

 species of at least six modern genera, all of which have since been 

 named. Under these circumstances it had better l)e left as a 

 synonym of ClnuHiliu, as the diagnosis precludes its use for any of 

 the other groups included.

 sou (Malacology, p. 311), and still again, for the group now gener- 

 ally known as Cylichna (t. c. ]). 326. See Man. of Couch., XV, p. 

 287). It is now, so far as we know, impossible to decide whether 

 Pfeiffer's group was published prior to Swainson's or vice versa. 

 Cossmann has proposed to substitute the term Distcectria (q. v.) for 

 Cylindrella Pfr. As Cylindrella is later than both Urocoptis and 

 Brachypodella, and the same name was used in the same year for 

 two other groups, we reject it from the nomenclature of this family.

These are mainly slender Brachypodella species. Name preoc-

 reference to the list of species originally as.signed to Cylindrella, it 

 ■will be seen that long before the year l-SIU, every one was amply 

 provided with generic names, Gongylodoma Wh. and Brachypodella 

 Beck including all of them. The name DisOrxtria, therefore, falls 

 as a synonym. Being of even date with Spartitm IIarr.it Burr. 

 (7. 1'.), it might possibly dispute supremacy with that term as a 

 generic name for "Cylindrella " parisienais Desh. : but it is obvious 

 that that species (which, in our ojunion, is not a Cylindrella nor a 

 nu'mher of the same family), does not require both a generic and 

 aubgeneric name.

III. CLASSIFIED LISTS OF SPECIES. 



As the groups defined by us in the preceding table of classification 

 differ radically in limits from those hitherto accepted, it is necessary 

 to supplement tlie characterization of the genera and subgenera by 

 detailed lists of species. Tliese lists contain only species whose 

 characters we have ascertained by the examination of sections. 

 Those we have not been able to examine are omitted,* although a 

 large part of them could doubtless be approximately grouped by the 

 published information. 



The names of species of which the radula is known are distin- 

 guished by the following syml)ols : " (C F) " after the name of a 

 species indicates that the dentition has been examined by Crosse & 



* The lists are, therefore, a catalogue of the species in the collection of the 

 Academy, excluding a considerable number of doubtful, unidentified or new 

 species. Any forms not mentioned herein we will be glad to receive and offer 

 an exchange for.

Genus TJROCOPTIS Dock. 



This genus is restricted to Cul)a, Jamaica and Haiti, with a few 

 stragglers from the Cuban fauna in south Florida. It is practi- 

 cally a group of the Greater Antilles. The tyjtical forms, with the 

 axis simple, are the most widely spread and probably the oldest 

 type. The large, stout forms being a local development common to 

 Jamaica and Haiti. 



The forms with spiral folds or other ornamentation of the axis 

 are confined to Cuba and the adjacent portion of Haiti. There is 

 every reason to believe them autochthonous to Cuban soil, a few 

 species recently spreading eastward. 



This genus shows the bond between Jamaica and Haiti to be 

 "rather stronger than between Cuba and Haiti, the Cuban groups 

 occurring in Haiti being represented l)y very few species, and these 

 restricted to the extreme western end of the island. 



The elements common to Jamaica and Cuba are the more general- 

 ized and j)re^umably older sectional gnnips of the genus. 



Respecting the habits and environment of the Jamaican Cylin- 

 drellas of both the genera Uroroptis and Brachypoch./la, Mr. Charles 

 T. Sim[)son writes of the experiences of Mr. J. B. Henderson and 

 himself, as follows: "C. snngrdned, roieu, obcsa, cylindriiK, agpem, 

 brevis and allied forms live on the ground among the scrub and 

 dead leaves, and are of just about the color of their surroundings. 

 We found ('. nohlfior altundant in a talus of decomposed shaly rock 

 at liogwalk, of which it was almost exactly the color. C. semiituila, 

 alba and roberUi are found in the crevices of craggy limestone 

 rocks, among cliffs. C. mbi-a and leurlla live in the ground in 

 thickets where there is abundance of dea<l and decaying wood. 

 The shells, in form anil color, alivays look exactly like pieces of broken 

 tici'js, which are found abundantly with them, and it whh a long 

 time before Henderson and I found a .-ingle specimen. They are 

 very abundant though in pro{>er localities. C. gracilis Wood grows 

 invariably on the trunks and stems of trees in thick scrub. These 

 trees have grayish or whitish spotted bark ; the little rascals attach 

 themselves to it by the foot and stand out with the shell nearly at

 doubtless passed by thousands of them, never dreaming for a mo- 

 ment that they were Cylindrelias." 



Mr. UselmaC. Smith found B. clon(/(ita living on limestone cliffs, 

 upon which the white shells hung like stalactites, for which he at 

 first mistook them.

Preponderantly Antillean, this genus has representatives upon the 

 mainland bordering the Gulf of Mexico from Venezuela to Florida. 

 These peripheral species are apparently all members of the section 

 Microceramus. In the West Indies the genus is present on nearly 

 every island, but is especially developed in Cuba, to which Spiro- 

 ceramus is confined. It is poorly represented in Jamaica by a few 

 species of ihe group Microceramus, to which the species of the 

 Bahamas likewise belong.

Goims HOLOSPIRA vim Miutens. 



This genus, which is confined to the nmiuland of Mexico and the 

 adjacent States of the Union, offers au interesting series of structures 

 in the internal hunellio, parallel to those of TJrocoptis. The prin- 

 cipal divergence from that genus is in the frequent development of 

 parietal and basal lamella, whicli are of rare occurrence in tlie 

 Antillean genera. 



Professor Dall," who has ably investigated the subject, gives the 

 following classification, which seems worthy of unqualified ap- 

 proval : — 



Subgenus Holospira s. s., type N. inlocerel Pfr., with section 

 Bostrichocentrum Strebel & Pfeffer, Haploatenwia, Eudistemma and 

 Distomospira Dall. 



Subgenus jNIetastoma Strebel & Pfeffer, type H. roemeri Pfr. 



Subgenus Ccklostemma Dall, type H. elizabethce Pilsbry. 



The first group includes species with au axial plait aud usually 

 various other arn)ature. More or less similar structures occur in 

 Gongylostoma. Metasloma has the axis simj)le, asin typical Urocop- 

 t'ls and Brachypodella. In Coelostemma a swollen, vertically cost- 

 ulate axis is found, unlike any Antillean type, although there is 

 some analogy with the subgenus Idiostemma Pils. & Van. 



Genus EUCALODITJM Crosse & Fischer. 



In this Mexican genus the large, solid shell resembles typical Uro- 

 coptis; the axis is solid and sinuous, with a continuous spiral plait, 

 as in the subgenus Arangia P. & V., of Urocoptis. 



The subgenus Oligostylus Pils.'" has the axis straight and smooth, 

 as in typical Urocoptis. 



These two types of pillar are exactly paralleled also in the genus

 the table land of Lower California.

The hollow and usually vertically ribbed axis is unlike any of the 

 Antillean types, although radiating spines, such as Dall describes in 

 C astrophorea, recall certain forms of Gongylostoma. In the section 

 Spartocentrum Dall" there is a spiral inflation and no vertical rib- 

 lets. 



Genus CERION (Bolt.) Morch. 

 See Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1896, p. :n.'). 



This genus has generally been placed in the neighborhood of 

 Pupa, but it is not closely allied to that group in shell characters 

 and is entirely diverse in genitalia. It may possibly belong to the 

 Odontostominte ( Odontostomu.-^, Toinigerus, A7iastoma) of South Amer- 

 ica ; but we prefer to associate Cerion with the Holospira and Euca- 

 lodium groups of Urucoptidce.^'' 



As this genus has been made the subject of special papers by Dr. 

 AV. H. Dall and by the present writers, it need only be said here 

 that it differs from the other genera in being strictly littoral in dis- 

 tribution, never straying far from the sea shore. The Miocene forms 

 (Eostrophia) are probably aberrant rather than primitive, in lack- 

 ing parietal anrl axial laminre. 



Genus MEOASPIEA Lea. 



A Brazilian group very peculiar in its polygyrate shell with large, 

 rounded nuclear whorls, plicate columella and peculiar internal arma- 

 ture, somewhat recalling Go)igylosto7iui, Idlostemma, etc. This has 

 been described and figured by (ial)b." The dentition we have now 

 examined (PI. XVII, fig. 1), tiie radula having been found in a dry 

 shell. There are 28"! '28 teeth, arranged in slightly sinuous tran.s- 

 verse rows, and of the type usual in ground snails, much like tlxjse 

 of Eucalodium, Berendtia, etc.

Meijaspira was placed in the vicinity of ClausUia by Deshayes, 

 who thouglit the internal structure indicated the presence of a clausi- 

 lium. This inference does not seem justified by the facts of the case, 

 though we are far from denying its possibility ; our specimen with 

 the soft parts dried in shows no trace of a clausilium. Upon the 

 whole, it would appear that Megaapira is an aberrant member of the 

 Urocoptidce, nearest perhaps to Eucalodium among existing genera. 



The South African genus Cce/ax-j*- and the Papuan and Australian 

 Perrieria are somewhat similar to the foregoing American genera, 

 but are doubtless correctly referred to Pupid(E, near ClausUia. Per- 

 Heria has a complicated internal armature, only partially worked 

 out by Fischer. 



The Colombian Rhodea is probably referable to the Achatinidos^ 

 grouping near Subulina Beck (type S. octona).

CHITONS COLLECTED BY DE. HAROLD HEATH AT PACIFIC GROVE, 

 NEAR MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA. 



BY n. A. PIL8BRY. 



During the summer of 1897 Dr. Heath collected a series of inver- 

 tebrates and fishes for the Academy, including some twenty-four 

 species and varieties of Polyplacophora. As he has kindly engaged 

 to collect again during the present season, a full report on the 

 Chitons, with illustrations of new, unfigured and unusual forms may 

 be deferred until further specimens come to hand ; but it may be 

 well to enumerate tlie forms already seen, and describe two which 

 seem to be new. 



It is evident that the Mopalias require more study than has yet 

 been given them. At Pacific Grove, the typical innscosa, tyjiical 

 liyno-id and typical Hindsii occur, without, so far as the series seen 

 shows, any specimens of inlermediate character. The reference of 

 these to ones[)ecies may, therefrtre, have been premature. A Mnjiulia 

 described lielow, differs from those hitherto known in the j)erfectly 

 regular form of the tail valve, which is like that of Ischnochiton, 

 thus l)reaking down, in large measure, the distinction between the 

 Ischnochitonidce and the Mnpallidce. This lawless Sjiecies is new, 

 and I have given myself the jjleasure of associating the name of my 

 friend Dr. Heath with it. 



The occurrence of two seven-valved adult monsters is also notable. 

 I shall return to these on a later occa.sion.

One full grown specimen is 7-valvecl, otherwise normal. 

 Mopalia Heathii n. sp. 



Ohiong, rather elevated, carinated, with nearly straight side 

 slopes; surface snioothish to the naked eye, lusterless, and in color 

 (1) olive-green with some lighter spots, or purplish maculation, or 

 slight roseate suffusion, or (2) vivid red, with scattered blue spots. 



Valves sha])ed as in M. lignosa, but without a median anterior 

 ])rojection of the tegmentum ; the intermediate valves very faintly 

 radially trisulcate at the sides, the anterior two grooves defining the 

 low, slight and inconspicuous diagonal rib, the lateral areas not 

 raised ; entire surface very finely and evenly granulate, the granules 

 small, rather pointed, separated, intervals very minutely, radially 

 wrinkle-granulate. Anterior valve with a few faint, shallow radial 

 furrows. Posterior valve with semicircular posterior outline, the 

 mucro in front of the middle of tegmentum, profile of the surface in 

 front of it convex, that of the posterior sloiie decidedly concave. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF rHILADELPHIA. 289 



Interior deep rose color or slightly purplish ; sutural laminae and 

 sinus about as in lignosa. Teeth rather long and somewhat rough- 

 ened, as in lignosa. Valve i with 8 slits ; ii-vii with 1-1 ; valve viii 

 entirely " Ischnoid," with regular, crescentic insertion plate, cut by 

 7 or 8 slits, which are somewhat closer posteriorly ; no sinus behind. 



Girdle leathery, nude except for solitary or two or three closely 

 grouped long bristles at all or part of the sutures, one on each side 

 of the head valve, and two behind the tail valve. 



Gills about 25 on each side, not extending quite to the anterior 

 end of the foot. 



Length 25, width 12 mm. (dried specimen), or smaller. 



In one specimen there are 9 bristles on each side and one in the 

 middle in front. Another lacks this median bristle ; and in still 

 another, .some of the sutures are without bristles. In all, some of 

 them are broken oH' close to the girdle, leaving only stumps or pores. 



This form resembles 3f. sinuata and im-porcatu in the sutural 

 bristle.s, but differs from them in sculpture and form of the tail valve. 

 The latter is completely as in Ischnochiton, and its form is approached 

 only by M. (icnfa Cpr., which however lia.s a slight caudal sinus, 

 much stronger sculpture, more depressed and more posterior nuicnt, 

 and scattered hairs on the girdle, without sutural bristles. It is 

 also blue-green or i)ale blue inside, while M. Heathii is rose colored. 

 One of the specimens was dredged in 17 fms. ; station of the others 

 unknown. 



Nuttallina Thotnasi n. i>ii. 



General form oblong, rather depressed, not keeled dorsally ; sur- 

 face granulose when not eroded. Color blackish or dark brown, 

 with a wliitish baiui on each side of the median line of back, or irre- 

 gular whitish maeulation; girdle dark. 



Intermediate valves short and wide, with a slight or hardly notice- 

 able d('j)ression on each side of the jugum, an<i others in front of and 

 behind the scarcely defined, obsok-te, diagonal convexity ; the ante- 

 rior and jtosterior margins subparallel, slightly arcuate Anterior 

 valve granulate, without radial ribs, the po.-tcrior margin excavated 

 mesially. Posterior valve with tegmentum slightly wider than the 

 anterior, the obtuse niucro somewhat behind the middle. 



Interior blue-green, with the area behind the valve-callu.s dark 

 brown, or livid purplish, with liglit sutural laminie and blue-green 

 area behind the sintir<. Slits in valve i, 9 or 10; valves ii to vii, 

 1-1 ; valve viii, 10 or 11. Teeth rather separated, tho.se of valve i 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



unequal, slightly rugose outside; posterior tooth of valves ii to vii 

 small, very obliquely directed forward ; teeth of valve viii very 

 short, strongly directed forward and roughened. Sinus wide and 

 square, spongy, the area behind it transversely grooved. Eaves 

 rather wide, " spongy " or porous. 



Girdle sparsely covered with short, rigid, obtuse, glossy spines of 

 a blackish-brown color, or occasionally some are whitish. 



Gills in type specimen, 26 on left, 23 on right side; not quite 

 reaching the anterior end of the foot. In another there are 23 on 

 the left, 25 on the right side. 



Length 15, breadth 8 mm., or smaller. 



Pacific Grove, in small tide-pools 4 to 8 ft. above mean tide mark. 



This species differs markedly from N. Californica (' Nutt.' Rve.) 

 and jY. J{uxa (Cpr.)' in the 5«h()rter valves, lack of radial ribs on the 

 anterior and intermediate valves, and more anterior mucro of the 

 posterior valve, and the single slitting of valves ii to vii. I at first 

 considered it a Middendorffia, but the girdle is like that of Nuttal- 

 lina, not having the peculiarly modified spines of the Mediterranean 

 Middendorffia. It lives with a small form of Trachydermon (Cyano- 

 plax) Raymondi, which is much more numerous in the tide-pools. 

 From that species it may be known by the spiny girdle. Nearly all 

 the specimens collected are much eroded. 



This species may be considered the type of a new subgenus of 

 Nuttallina, with the following difi'erential characters: Intermediate 

 valves with 1-1 slits; anterior valve not radially ribbed ; posterior 

 valve with the mucro post-median, but not terminal. Other char- 

 acters as in Nutlallina. 



At Mr. Heath's request, it is named in honor of Mr. Thomas, who 

 found the first specimens.

NOTES ON ME. THOMAS MEEHANS PAPER ON THE PLANTS OF LEWIS 

 AND CLARK'S EXPEDITION ACROSS THE CONTINENT. 1804 06. 



BY DR. ELLIOTT COUES. 



Many years af,'o I prepared for publication in these Proceedings 

 a paper on the plants of Fort Macon, N. C. It never appeared, 

 because I submitted it to Professor Asa Gray, who told me it was a 

 very good one, but a.sked me what was the use of printing it. Taking 

 the hint to heart, I have from that ilay to this curl)ed any as^pira- 

 tions I may have felt to botanical authorship ; and it now behooves 

 me to explain why I presume to have anything to say on a l)ot:ini- 

 cal subject. In fact, I do not now write on Lewis and Clark's 

 plants, Init solely on the localities where their plants were procured. 

 I do not [»retend to any knowledge of botany, but if there is any- 

 thing I do know, it is exactly where Lewis and Clark were on every 

 day, almost every hour, from start to finish of their fanious expedi- 

 tion. Consequently, I can give the precise locality of every speci- 

 men which bears a date in the herbarium that Mr. Meehan recently 

 discovered to be .still extant, and thu.s available for the determina- 

 tion of so many of the type specimens of Pursh's 9()ecie8. This 

 discovery seems to me one of the happiest and most imjjortant that 

 could have been made, ami I doubt not that Mr. Meehan's identifi- 

 cations of these j)lunts, with the assi.'^tance of Me.<srs. Kobin.'-on and 

 Greenrnan, will be justly regarded as a boon to working botanist.". 

 I could wi.sh that the.se writers had effected what I conceive should 

 have been done to set forth the whole matter in it.s proper light, but 

 since they did not give the requisite precision to Pur.><li'.s generally 

 loo.^e and vague, sometimes wholly erroneous, inilications of locality, 

 that duty seems to devolve upon me. 



In reading Mr. Meehan's paper, I have JK-en little .short of 

 astounded at the kind of geograpliy which seems to have answered 

 the purposes of the botanists concerned in this case. Nothing of 

 the sort would satisfy a zoologist, I am sure. To describe a new spe- 

 cies upon a ty[)e specimen, assigned to " the banks of the Mis.souri," 

 or to "the valleys of the Rocky Mountains," would not be tolerated 

 in zoology, and should not be endured in botany, when the data 




292 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



required to pin every dated specimen down to the precise spot where 

 it was collected are ample, and easily accessible in the edition of 

 Lewis and Clark which I brought out in 1893. 



Neither praise nor blame attaches to me for any of the botany 

 which appears in that work. As stated in my preface, most of the 

 botanical determinations were those of Mr. F. H. Knowlton, whom 

 I engaged for that purpose, and whose identifications of the plants 

 mentioned or described by Lewis and Clark I accepted without 

 question in any instance. That they should all prove to be correct 

 was not to be expected, and I am now aware of several errors. In 

 the case of the trees, the mistakes have, perhaps, all been detected 

 and corrected in the admirable critical review lately published by 

 Professor C. S. Sargent in Garden and Forest, Nos. 465, 466, Janu- 

 ary 20th and 27, 1897. I could wish that the same searchlight had 

 been turned by Mr. Meehan and his collaborators upon the rest of 

 the botany in my book, and venture to suggest that the whole sub- 

 ject will not be put in its full light or final shape till this has been 

 thoroughly well done. 



Great as are the obligations under which Mr. Meehan and his as- 

 sistants have placed all who are in any way interested in this sub- 

 ject, in the paper which I now proceed to annotate geographically, 

 there remains for some one the agreeable and useful task of review- 

 ing Lewis and Clark's botanical text as distinguished from their 

 specimens. For it is a curious fact, as I find on studying Mr. Mee- 

 han's paper, that the plants of which Lewis and Clark have most to 

 say in their Journal, are not, as a rule, those of which specimens are 

 now extant in their herbarium. Their botany, it may be said, runs 

 in two parallel courses. One of these is represented by the speci- 

 mens which they collected, and which became so many of Pursh's 

 types ; the other, by the herbs, shrubs and trees which they observed, 

 and noted in their narrative, but did not actually collect. Often- 

 times, to be sure, they describe what is in the herbarium, but I 

 should imagine that fifty, if not a hundred species are to be found 

 in the book, no specimens of which are known to be extant. This 

 would appear to me to be a field of research at once alluring and 

 stimulating to some well equipped botanist, and I trust that the 

 work may soon be done once and forever. Lewis and Clark's whole 

 botany could easily be set abreast of the status I have myself been 

 able to confer upon their zoology, their ethnology and their geo- 

 graphy. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 293 



With these remarks, which I trust will be found neither ungra- 

 cious nor presumptuous, I proceed to review Mr. Meehan's paper 

 from a purely geographical point of view. I take his list precisely 

 as it stands, assuming the identifications to be correct in every in- 

 stance, and raising no botanical questions whatever. I only follow 

 the zoologists' rules of nomenclature in writing all specific and sub- 

 specific names with a lower case initial letter, all personal names in 

 the genitive case with a single i, all trinomial names without the in- 

 tervention of" var." — a practice which I think most botanists would 

 like, if they could once get used to it.

 expedition was widely separated. Lewis was high up on JNIaria's 

 River near its forks in N. AV. Montana ; Clark was on the Yellow- 

 stone, at Camp Cottonwood, above Clark's fork of that river. Clark 

 was busy building boats, and no doubt Lewis collected the plant. 

 The latter botanized that day, as we see by his Journal, p. 1090 of 

 my edition.

 right for neither date in 1806, if the locality of this particular 

 specimen is meant. On July 9, 1806, Lewis was on Sun River, at 

 or near Fort Shaw, Montana. On July 19, 1806, he was high up 

 on Maria's River; both of these places are out of the mountains. 

 But probably the label was only meant to indicate the general 

 range of the plant, not the exact locality of the specimen. Peren-

nial flax was first noticed by the expeditiou on tlie ^lissouri above 

 the Great Fulls " for several days" before July 19, 1805, below, at 

 and above Dearborn's River, in the vicinity, not close, of Helena, 

 Montana. The species then described was identified as L. p€re7ine 

 by Mr. F. H. Knowlton, p. 423 of my edition of the work. Some 

 of the country traversed in July, 1805, distinctly includes "valleys 

 of the Rocky Mountains," and I suspect that " 1806 " should read 

 1805 ; also, that July " 9 " and " 19 " are merely scribal dui)lication 

 of a single date.

 means Hitter-root River, in so far as any plants collected are con- 

 cerned. Lewi.s named Clark's River September 6, 1805, when the 

 expedition was in Ross* Hole near the head of the east fork of the 

 Bitter-root River ; the party went down this river only as far as the 

 Lou Lou Fork just said, up which they turned sharp and .so on over

the Bitter-root raiif^e to the sources of the Kooskooskee. They 

 were never on the Chirk's River of modern geography, as the great 

 stream of which the Bitter-root is a collateral head does not now 

 bear Clark's name above the junction of the IJitter-root with Hell- 

 gate River. I may add that Leivisia redivioa, the racine amere (or 

 bitter root) of tiie French, is the plant from which the river, its 

 valley, and the mountain range on the west derive their name. An 

 alternative name of the Bitter-root was St. Mary's River, imposed 

 by Father P. J. De Smet in 1842.

 Bonhomme, South Dakota ; if 1805, on Fish Creek, a tributary of 

 Salmon River, Idaho ; if 1806, at or near James' River, South

 locality, as the expedition crossed the years 1804 and 1806 in pass- 

 ing Bonhomme Island on September 1st. I presume the year is 

 1804, for, in the case of the related Psoralea argophylla, collected 

 October 17, 1804, and in the present case of Petalostemon violaceus, 

 Lewis makes similar remarks on the use of these plants by the

 Wallawalhi and of modern Wallula. It is also elsewhere reported, 

 by L. i^: C. on the Columbia, much lower down. Mr. Meehan refers 

 to the Journal of January 20, 1806, but there is no allusion to the 

 plant at that date. lie evidently means the description of No. 12 

 of the botanical list drawn up at Fort Clatsoj) : this is found on p. 

 826 of my edition, but there are no dates in this list. I am sorrv to 

 find that Mr. Knowlton has discredited the identification, supposing 

 No. 12 to be Pyrtia rivularii. It is correctly giveji, however, on p. 

 908, March 25, 1806, when the expedition was in the vicinity of 

 Puget's Island. Again, on June 10, 1806 (p. 1041 of my edition), 

 when L. & C. left Camp Chopiinnish, they s{)eak of the "purple

 River (not the one so named by L. & C.) falls into the left bank of 

 the Missouri. The Journal of this date, p. 1173 of my edition, 

 has this note: "In the low grounds of the river Captain Clark 

 found to-day a species of cherry which he had never seen before, 

 and which seems peculiar to this small district of country, though 

 even here it is not very abundant." No identification was offered 

 in ray work, as I had no hint of what the species was, and I am

 of wild rose, both of a daniask-red color." These Mr. Knowlton

" sacaconimis " used fur this plant by " Engages," tliat it is not 

 clear who "Engages" were; but an engage was any hired man of 

 a fur trading company; the word means precisely the same as em- 

 ploye or employee. Mr. Meehan states that " Professor Knowlton 

 in the notes to Coues' edition of the travels, suggests the name 

 Ardostaphi/los puiigens for this." But I cannot find ^-1. pnugena in 

 my book. Sacaconimis is given in four places, p. 139, p. 074, p.

Dodecatheon meadia L. 



A/nil 10, ISOO. Kock Fort Camp, on the Columbia. In his 

 footnote Mr. Meehan Haya : "There might have been a specimen 

 collected on the march up the Missouri in 1804, as in the Journal 

 under date A|)ril 17th, it is noted that ' violets, doves foot and (;ow-

slips are in hloom,' the Dodecatheon being probably referred to as cow- 

 slips." But L. and C. were not on the voyage up the Missouri on 

 April 14, 1804; they did not start till May 14, 1804, and at date of 

 April 17, 1804, there is not a word about cowslips in the Journal. 

 What Mr. Meehan means is a passage in the meteorological register 

 kept by L. and C. at Camp Dubois, at the mouth of Wood River, 

 which empties into the Mississippi in Illinois, till the date of their 

 departure. The correct quotation for April 17, 1804, is: "the 

 violet, dove's-foot, and cowslip are in blow," p. 1283 of my edition. 

 Mr. Meehan's other citation of "cowslip," at date of April 9, 1806, 

 also found in the meteorological register, p. 1295 of my edition, is 

 correctly referred to the Columbia River.

 flats, on the Lo Lo Trail, west of the Bitter-root Mountains. So also 

 does Pursh's " on the Missouri Flats near the Rocky Mountains," 

 which reads curiously to one who knows the geography of the route. 

 It is wrong by several hundred miles — yet not so far out of the way 

 as some others of his that I could instance.

 "banks of the Mississippi," as cited in Mr. Meehan's paper, is more

 August 9, 1806, L. and C. were on the Missouri below the mouth of

 of that date, p. 1297 of ray edition. It should be particularly noted 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 



that the Quaiuasli flats of L. & C. of June 29th are not those of

I do not understand why Mr. Meehan, or Messrs. Robinson and 

 Greenman, should use Cama-isia esculenta as the technical name of 

 this plant. The first specific name being quamash Pursh, 1814, and 

 the first tenable generic name being Qiiamasia Rafinesque, February, 

 1818, the coupling of these as Qnamasia quamash is the required 

 name of the plant, as first given by Mr. Coville, Pr. Biol. Soc. Wash.

LIST OF BATS COLLECTED BY DR. W. L. ABBOTT IN SIAM. 

 HY (JERRIT 8. MILLER, JR. 



During the year 1890, Dr. W. L. Abbott made an extensive col- 

 lection of niamnials in the State of Trong, Lower Siam, a region 

 whose fauna has hitherto been practically unknown. The collection, 

 which Dr. Abbott has presented to the United States National Mu- 

 seum, includes sixty-one bats, all but six of which were sent to 

 Washington in formalin. Eleven species are represented. Three 

 of these prove to be new, while several others are of special interest. 

 Considerable time must elapse before it will be possible to prepares 

 complete account of Dr. Abbott's Malayan collections. Meanwhile 

 it seems advisable to publish a list of the bats that he has thus far

 Cynopterus angalatus hji. nov. 



Type.— Adnh S (in alcohol), No. 83,569, United States National 

 Museum, Trong, Lower Siara, collected in 1896 by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 



' From fresh specimen by collector. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 



General characters. — Size medium (forearm 60-70) ; tail well- 

 developed ; incisors \ ; ear conspicuously rimmed with white ; poste- 

 rior border of ear couch with well-developed angular projection im- 

 mediately above base; general color dull rufous. 



Ears. — Ears about double length of muzzle; laid forward they 

 reach to anterior corner of eye. General form of ear as in Cynop- 

 terus brachysoma (see Dobson, Monograph of the Asiatic Chiroptera, 

 p. 28), but projection at base of outer margin sharply angled instead 

 of bluntly rounded. Tip of conch rather narrowly rounded off. A 

 slight, though distinct, concavity in posterior border immediately 

 below tip. Rim of ear with a conspicuous whitish border, about 1.5 

 mm. wide near base and narrowing to a mere trace at tip, but never- 

 theless continuous. Area occupied by white border on anterior mar- 

 gin distinctly thickened. Inner surface of ear conch with six in- 

 distinct cross ridges. Basal third of ear furred externally, the 

 remainder naked inside and out except for a few hairs along ante- 

 rior margin. 



Membranes. — Membranes thick and leathery, broad and ample. 

 Interfemoral membrane dee[)ly eniarginate, only 6 mm. wide in 

 middle. Wings from sides of back and middle of outer toe. 



Fur and color. — Throughout the body the fur is short and scant, 

 that on the middle of back only 6 mm. in length. In males it is dis- 

 tinctly longer on sides of neck (10 mm. in type), and in both sexes 

 it is much shorter on throat and on sides of body (this especially 

 noticeable in females). The fur of the body extends to middle of 

 forearm, both above and below, but does not reach the membranes 

 excei)t ir) middle of uroi)atagium. I'ropatagium thinly haired below 

 through proximal half Wings with scattered hairs below along 

 sides of body and behind forearm. 



General color (jf two mules (skins) burnt unibir, t(; a varying ex- 

 tent tinged with red and overlaid with olivaceus, darker on crown 

 of head and paler along mi«ldle of belly. A female is palor through- 

 out, the general color more clo.sely approaching the chestnut and 

 russpt of Kidgway. Ears and membranes of dry specimens black- 

 ish, the former edged with dirty yellowish-white. Metacar[)als and 

 phalanges of fingers varied with whitish, which irregularly involves 

 the membrane close to the bone. 



Skull. — The skull is strongly built and moderately angular. Old 

 individuals show a tendency to fornj a sagittal crest.^ Face line 

 slightly concave injmediately behind tip of rostrum, then nearly 




318

straight to highest point about over middle of brain case. Frontal 

 region with a broad longitudinal groove running from between post- 

 orbital processes to within about 3 mm. of tip of rostrum. Post- 

 orbital processes well-developed, about 4 mm. long. Extent of bony 

 palate behind molars equal to distance between second premolars. 



Teeth. — Upper incisors in pairs, the outer tooth slightly smaller 

 than the inner. First upper premolar about as large as inner in- 

 cisor, occupying less than half the space between canine and second 

 premolar. Crowns of second and third premolars about equal 

 when viewed from above, the first much the larger when viewed 

 from the side. Molar about equal to third premolar, but with 

 slightly narrower crown. Outer lower incisors distinctly larger than 

 inner, the incisor row slightly bowed outward. First lower premolar 

 more than double as large as first upper premolar, and like it occu- 

 pying the middle of the space between the canine and second pre- 

 molar. Crowns of second and third premolars and first molar sub- 

 equal when viewed from above, but regularly graded in height from 

 before backward when viewed from the side. Second lower molar 

 about one-third as large as first and equal to first premolar.

General remarks. — Cynoptenis angulatus bears a strong resem- 

 blance to C. marginatum, but is readily distinguisliable by its consid- 

 erably smaller size and by the form of the ear. It is hirger than C. 

 brachysuma, the only other known species with similarly formed 

 ear, and quite different in color.

Hipposideros larvatus niomflcld). 



One rikin and ten specimens in formalin. 



The form occuring in Trong difrer.>< considerably from the lHjipo- 

 aideros larvntns of Dobson and HIanford, which is represented in the 

 National Museum collection by two specimens (in alcohol) taken at 

 Bhano, Upi)er Burma, by Fea. As the type of I'hijllorhiint lur- 

 vnta Ilorsfield came from Java, the probabilities are that if cither 

 of the mainland forms is referable to the typical sul)spccics, it is* the 

 one inhabiting the southern half of the Malay IVnin.-ula. A.^sum- 

 ing this to be the case, the form of Jli/>posidcro.-< larvtttiis found in 

 Assam and Upper J^tirma is unnamed. As compared with the 

 northern and better known form, that from Trong is slightly smaller 

 in general size. The foot is disproportionately smaller, and the <*ar

Megaderma spasma (Linnaeus). 



An adult male in formalin and one skin. The latter is an adult 

 female taken on March 28, 1896. On the lahel of this .'specimen Dr. 

 Ahbdtt has written : " Uterus contained a fetus about two inches in 

 length and hairless. Discoidal placenta about :] inch in diameter." 



While this bat is clearly not related to Megaderma lyra, I am not 

 satisfied that it is the M. fipasma of Dobson and Blanford. From 

 the descriptions of the latter species it differs in the following char- 

 ,acter.s : skull with small but evident postorbital processes (more pro- 

 nounced than in Dobson's figure of M. lyra) ; mesopterygoid fossa 

 divided l)y a central longitudinal ridge in its anterior half only; 

 first upper premolar very small and partly hidden by cingulum of 

 second premolar which is almost, or quite, in contact with canine; 

 inner basal cusp of upper canine indistinct; middle lower inci-sors 

 trifid ; posterior branch of tragus apparently longer ; free upper part 

 ofuo.se leaf with very strongly convex sides and a deep constriction 

 at base; heart shaped supplemental leaf above nostrils barely reach- 

 ing edge of principal leaf.

 Tylonycteris pachypus (Tommincki. 



Twenty-eight specimens in formalin. 



The genus Tylonydi rii. although currently united with Vespertllio 

 (jrz" Vesperuis ") appears to be perfectly valid. It may be defined as 

 follows: Dental formula (as in Venpertilio), i, ^~' ; c, *^* ; ;>hj, ^—^ ; 

 m, ?-r'»=32 ; skull very broad and flat, with greatly reduced rostrum 

 and no trace of sagittal crest; i)all of thumb and sole of fcjot pro- 

 vidt^d with broad, disc-shaped pads. 



Four specimens from Buitenzorg, Java, agree in size with those 

 from Trong, but in color they are much lighter. This diHI'rence 

 may be due to alteration in color resulting from long immersion in 

 alcohol. The Javan specimens were collected by G. B. Ferrari, and 

 have been in the National Mu.seum since 1890. 



Scotophilus kuhli l.'-i'li. 



An adult female and throe young. 



The genus represented l)y this bat is so closely related to the 

 North American Nijcticehu* that it is doubtful whether the two can 

 be regarded as di.-*tin<'t. The characters {)ointed out by Dob.'^on, 

 however, appear to be of nearly as much imj)urtance as those separ- 

 ating Nycticeina and Rhogertno.

Tiijie. — Adult (? I in alcohol), No. 83,547, Trong, Lower Siam, 

 September, 1896. Collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott. 




322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



General characters. — About the size of the Bornean Kerivoula 

 pimlla Thomas,- but with shorter ears, feet and legs, less hairy wings, 

 and more uniform coloration. Upper incisors bicuspidate; crowns 

 of upper premolars with transverse diameter equal to or slightly 

 greater than antero-posterior diameter. 



Ears. — The ears are relatively shorter than in K. hardwickii ; laid 

 forward they reach to nostril. Anterior border extremely convex, 

 much more so than in A", hardiriekii, but ])robal)ly about as in K. 

 pusil/a. Posterior border with subterminal concavity very shallow 

 and close to tip of ear. Tragus essentially as in K. hardwickii, but 

 with a distinct iiotcli immediately above anterior base. 



Membranes. — Membranes very thin and delicate, light brown with 

 irreguhir pelhicid mottling. The specimen is in an excellent state 

 of preservation, so that this mottling of the membranes must be re- 

 garded as a normal character. Wings essentially naked as in K. 

 hardwickii ; uropatagium more hairy. The fur of the body extends 

 along the base of the wings in a very narrow line only ; beyond this 

 a few inconspicuous hairs are scattered over the area bounded ex- 

 ternally by the Ime from elbow to knee. Proximal half of inter- 

 femoral membrane rather thickly sprinkled with yellowish hairs, 

 which extend along the legs to feet. 



Fur and color. — Fur long and soft, but not dense ; that on mid- 

 dle of back about 10 mm. in length. 



Color ochrace'us buff throughout, scarcely paler on the belly, the 

 hairs of the back faintly tipped with rufous. Except on the head and 

 membranes the hairs are everywhere j)himbeous at base. 



Skull. — Skull much smaller than that of A", hardwickii, but with 

 relatively broader and heavier rostrum. Brain case much more in- 

 flated anteriorly than in K. hardwickii. 



Teeth. — Each upper incisor bicuspidate, relatively smaller than in 

 K. hardwickii; the outer separated from the canine by a distinct 

 space. First and second upper premolars subequal in all dimen- 

 sions, the transverse diameter of each equalling or slightly exceeding 

 the a ntero posterior diameter. Crowns of molars relatively narrower 

 than in K. hardwickii. Two inner lower incisors trifid and each 

 considerably smaller than the unicuspid outer incisor. Lower pre- 

 molars essentially like those of the up[)er jaw. 



Measurements. — Total length, 70; head and body, 31 (33)'; tail, 



'Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 6th ser., XIV, p. 461, December, 1894.

General ronarks. — Kericoula muuda is in no way closely related 

 to K. hardwickii or to any of the species hitherto known from the 

 mainland of Asia. Its relationships are wholly with the .small 

 Bornean form recently described by Mr. Thomas as K. pu-iilla. 



Dr. Abbott secured only one specimen of this species. 



Emballonnra peninsniaris ^<. n«r. 



Tiip>\—\i\n\i $ (in alcohol). No. 83,575, United States National 

 Museum, Trong, Lower Siara, November, 1896. Collected by Dr. 

 W. L. Abbott. 



General characters. — In general appearance most like Embullo- 

 nnra monticola Temminck, one of the smaller members of the genus, 

 but in size slightly surpassing E. semicaudata (Peale), the largest 

 species hitherto known. 



Ears. — Ears moderate ; when laid forward they extend slightly 

 beyond nostril. Anterior margin straight from base (over middle 

 of eye) to about middle, whence it is faintly convex to slight con- 

 cavity immediately below tip. Tip very narrowly rounded off. 

 Posterior border concave immediately below tip, then gently and 

 evenly convex to faint notch opposite bn.«e of tragup, after which it 

 is more abruptly convex to ba^e, which is distinctly below line of 

 lower lip. Inner surface of conch with thirteen rros.^ striations 

 ari-tiug near posterior border ami (li-iipj»earing .'^liorfly beyond mid- 

 dle. 



Tragus with anterior and [m.-^tirinr bordorn nearly jiarailel. th(»ugh 

 on close inspection each is seen to be very faintly concave. As a 

 result the tragus is slightly narrower at mid height than at ba«c or 

 immediately below the bluntly rounded tip. Whole periphery of 

 trairus faintly creiiulate. A trace of a lobe on posterior margin ju.>it 

 below level of anterior base. 



Membrane.^. — The membranes are full and an)ple, but in no way 

 peculiar. Wings from ankles. Uroi)atagium including tail to l)a.'<e 

 of penultimate vertebra. Distance fron> lip of tail to free edge of 




324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



membrane considerahly more than length of tail. Upper surface of 

 uropatagiuin thinly furred to line of tip of tail. Lower surface of 

 uropatagium rather thickly sprinkled with short hairs along veins 

 except near legs. Wings naked except where fur of body extends 

 both above and below to line joining middle of humerus with lower 

 third of femur. 



Fur and color. — Fur of middle of back about 11 mm. in length. 

 Face and muzzle practically naked. Fur of head covering basal 

 third of ears. 



Dorsal surface uniform dark sepia ; under parts much paler, very 

 near the broccoli brown of Ridgway. Hairs everywhere, both above 

 and below, indistinctly whitish at base. jSIuzzle, ears and mem- 

 branes blackish. 



Feet. — The feet are slender, a little less tlian half as long as tibia 

 and considerably more than half as long as calcar. Calcar slender, 

 weak and ill-defined, 3-5 mm. shorter than tibia, terminating in a 

 small lobe. 



Skull. — Skull thin and papery ; muzzle about ? as wide as brain 

 case, slightly inflated laterally, and with a deep central longitudinal 

 groove ; postorbital processes long and very slender, reaching almost 

 to higliest point of zygomata; brain case strongly inflated poste- 

 riorly. Measurements of two skulls : No. 83,574, 9 adult ; greatest 

 length, 14; basilar length, 10.4; zygomatic breadth, 8.8 ; greatest 

 anteorbital breadth, 5.8 ; palatal length, 4 ; width of palate between 

 posterior molars, 3.4; length of upper tooth row (exclusive of in- 

 cisors) 5.2 ; mandible, 9.6 ; lower tooth row (exclusive of incisors), 

 5.6. No. 83,556, ^ adult; greatest length, 14; basilar length, 10.4 ; 

 zygomatic breadth, 9 ; greatest anteorbital breadth, 5.4 ; length of 

 postorbiial process, 3 ; palatal length, 4; width of palate between 

 posterior molars, 3 ; length of upper tooth row (exclusive of incisors), 

 5.2 ; mandible, 9 ; lower tooth row (exclusive of incisors) 5.4. 



Teeth. — The teeth are essentially as in the E. monlicola of Dobson, 

 except that the first upper premolar is tightly wedged between the 

 canine and second premolar, and the first lower premolar is very 

 much smaller than the second in cross section. 



General remarks. — Emhalloiiura peiiinsularu needs comparison 

 with only one species, the E. monlicola of Temminck.* I have seen 

 no specimens from Java, the type locality of this form, but Tem-

minck's original description is so full that it furnishes a satisfactory 

 basis for comparison. In passing it may be remarked that the 

 Philippine bat referred by Dobson to E.inonticola" is probably a dis- 

 tinct .species from either the Javan or peninsular forms, as tlie dis- 

 crepancies in measurements are too great to be the result of mere 

 individual variation. 



From E. monticola the peninsular form differs chiefly in its larger 

 size (forearm 43-45 instead of 40, extent of wings about 280 instead 

 of 215-230) and longer tail (see table of measurements). None of 

 the Trong specimens show tlie snutl'-colored head and fore-neck men- 

 tioned as occa.sionally occurring in E. monticola. The fur of the 

 ventral surface of the body is nearly as noticeably whitish at base 

 as that of the back, while in E. monticola it is said to be brown at 

 base. As shown in the table of measurements, Emballonnra penin- 

 sularii slightly exceeds E. semicaudata in size. It is thus the largest 

 known species of the genus. 



Dr. Abbott secured seven specimens, all of which were sent to'the 

 National Museum in formalin.

DESCRIPTIONS OF FIVE NEW PHYLLOSTOME BATS. 

 BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



The greater part of the material on which are l)ased the descrip- 

 tions of the following five new bats is contained in the United States 

 National Museum, and the descriptions are published here l)y per- 

 mission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. An impor- 

 tant collection from Jamaica, sent by the Museum of the Institute of 

 Jamaica to the United States Department of Agriculture, and sub- 

 mitted to me for determination by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, includes 

 topotypes of the little known Natalus viicropus Dobson, and the 

 unique type of Beithroiiyderis aphylla. The type and only known 

 specimen of Glossophaga longirostris forms part of a small collection 

 of l)ats made by Mr. W. W. Brown, Jr., at Santa Marta, Colombia, 

 and referred to me for identification by Mr. Outram Bangs. Series 

 of specimens from each of these collections are to be presented to the 

 National Museum. 



CHILONATALUS subgen. nov. (Natalinae). 

 Tyjie NiitaluH micropuH Dobson. 



Siibgeneric characters. — Similar to typical Natalus Gray, but with 

 conspicuous dermal outgrowths on chin and above nostrils. These 

 outgrowths, as pointed out by Dobson, produce a strong resemblance 

 to Chilonycteris. Males with a large glandu- 

 lar swelling on forehead, between and slightly 

 in front of eyes (figure 1). 



General remarks. — Natulus viicropus and N. 

 hrevlmanus differ so remarkably from the other 

 members of the genus that they must be re- 

 garded as forming at least a distinct subgenus. 

 The form of the glandular elevation above the 

 nostrils and the apparently double lower lip, 

 taken in connection with the other characters 

 pointed out by Harrison Allen in which the 

 Fig. 1. —I lead of C7n7o- iVa<a^i?iCC resemble Chilonycteris and Mor- 

 zImW,^ kftlf're- ^^^'Z'^' "'^y indicate a closer relationship be-

Natalus (Chilonatalus) brevimanus s]). nov. 



Nalahtu micrnpus .] . A. Allen, Bull. Am. Mns. Nat. IFist., IIT, p. 169, No- 

 vember, 14, 18*10. 



7>;)f.— Adult <? (in alcohol), No. 15.835, United States National 

 Museum, Old Providence Island, Caril)l)ean Sea. Presented by 

 Chas. B. Cory. 



Specific characters. — Slightly smaller than Natalus micropits Dob- 

 son' from Jamaica and with relatively longer ears and shorter 

 fingers. Color apparently paler than in N. micropus. 



General I'einarks. — Dr. J. A. Allen recorded the occurrence of this 

 bat on the island of Old Providence as long ago as 1800, but with 

 only a single individual at hand, he naturally considered it the same 

 as the Jamaican species. On comparing fifty-seven specimens from 

 Old Providence with three from Jamaica, I find a slight but re- 

 markably constant difference. Taking into consideration the per- 

 fect isolation of the two forms it seems best to apply to them bi- 

 nomial names. The characters are well brought out in the following 

 table of measurements. The apparent lighter color of N. brevimanus 

 may be due to the bleaching effect of alcohol, as I have seen no skins, 

 and both lots of specimens have been preserved for an unknown 

 length of time. 

 Mioronycteris microtis sp. nov. 



Tf/pe.— Adults (skin and skull) No. J|i|f, United States Na- 

 tional Museum. Collected at Greytown, Nicaragua, by Dr. L. F. 

 H. Birt. 



Specific characters. — Smaller than Micronycteris minutus (Gervais); 

 thumb, foot, calcar and membranes as in M. megalotis Gray ; ear 

 from meatus about half as long as forearm ; middle lower premolar 

 relatively larger than in M. megalotis ; general color wood-brown, 

 scarcely paler on ventral surface. 



Fur and color. — The fur is distributed precisely as in M. megalo' 

 lis, except that there is a .slightly more extensive sprinkling of hairs 

 on the dorsal surface of forearm. Fur on middle of back about 10 

 mm. in length. 



Color uniform wood-brown, slightly richer on dorsal surface. 

 Hairs on body both dorsally and ventrally, nearly white through 

 basal third. 



Ears. — Ears densely furred on basal half externally, the fur run- 

 ning up along anterior border to within 6 mm. of tip. Distal half

bare, with a few very fine scattered hairs. In form the ears are 

 much like those of M. megitlvtls. Their tip.s, liowever, are more 

 abruptly narrowed, a condition made still more apparent by their 

 much smaller size. Inner surface of auricle with eight sharply de- 

 fined cross ridges arising at posterior border and extending about 

 halfway across ear. The distance between the uppermost and lower- 

 most ridge is about 5 mm. 



Feet. — Foot distinctly shorter than calcar and slightly more than 

 half as long as tibia. 



SkuU. — In the type the brain case is more elevated immediately 

 behind the orbits, and the zygomata are less flaring than in the 

 skulls of M. inegalotis with which I have compared it, but these 

 differences may prove to be individual. 



Teeth. — When viewed from above, the crowns of the three lower 

 premolars appear to be of approximately equal size, though the 

 second is slightly smaller than either of the others. lu M. inegn- 

 lotis the crown of the middle lower premolar is very conspicuously 

 smaller than the first. In other respects the teeth of the twos|)ecies 

 aj)pear to be identical. 



(ieneral remarks. — Micro nycteri-t mirrotli is so different from the 

 other described species of the genus that it needs no special com- 

 parison with any. Fronj M. m er/a lot t.< its nearest geographical ally, 

 its small ears and uniform wood brown color separate it at a glajice. 

 Yet it i.-< probably most closely related to M. nuyidoti.'* and M. hir- 

 Hittn, since M. hehnti and M. munda, the only other known species, 

 are distinguished by differences in the proportions of the jiarts of 

 the fingers ami feet, to say nothing of the peculiar attachnitnt of 

 the wings in M. iniinUa. 



In the type of Micronycturis microtis the exact form of the nose 

 leaf cannot be determined. The free, upright portion of the leaf^ 

 liowever, appears to be shorter and broader than in either of the 

 races of M. megalntin. The whole leaf is finely pubescent. 



The striation of the inner side of the ear is very different in Micro- 

 nycteris microtis and M. megalotis. In the latter, instead of eight 

 sharply defined ridges crowd('(l into the space of 5 mm., there are 

 thirteen ill defined strin' with a distance nf iifarlv 10 riun. Ix'tween 

 the first and last.

Jalisco, Mexico, April 4, 1892, by E. W, Nelson. Original num- 

 ber 2,389. 



Snbspecific characters. — About the size of typical Micronycteria 

 megalotis Gray, but with longer middle finger and apparently lighter 

 color. 



General remarks. — While the j\Iexican material at hand is fairly 

 satisfactory, lacking only skins for the accurate determination of 

 color characters, the South American series is very deficient. Yet the 

 nine specimens that I refer to true megalotis agree very closely among 

 themselves, and differ fairly constantly from the ^Mexican form. 

 The color appears to be paler in the Mexican specimens, but as all 

 are preserved in alcohol no special weight can be attached to this 

 fact. The real characters of the two forms are shown in the accom- 

 panying table of measurements. 



Dohson's key to the species of Micronycteris (^ ' Schizostoma ') 

 rearranged and extended to include the two new forms just described 

 is as follows : 

 First phalanx of middle finger conspicuously shorter than second ; 



forearm 47 31. behnii (Peters). 



First j)halanx of middle finger approximately equal to second ; 

 forearm 30-40. 



Wing.s from tibise ; metacarpal of thumb about equal to remain- 

 ing parts ; calcar shorter than foot . . M. minuia (Gervais). 

 Wings from tarsus or metatarsus ; metacarpal of thumb much 

 longer than remaining parts ; calcar longer than foot. 



Legs and forearms conspicuously hairy. M. hirsuta (Peters). 

 Legs and forearms essentially bare. 



Ear from meatus about one-half forearm

 Ear from meatus about two-thirds forearm.

332 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



Fur and color. — In quality and distribution the fur resembles 

 that of G. soricina. It is 7 mm. in length on middle of back, 

 slightly longer on throat and shorter on belly. 



Color above dark hair brown, slightly tinged with Front's brown, 

 the hairs everywhere very pale hair brown through basal two-thirds 

 or three-fourths. Belly light broccoli brown, becoming much 

 darker on chest and throat. 



Ears. — As nearly as can be determined from the dried specimen 

 the ears are essentially as in G. soricina, though considerably larger 

 and apparently with broader tragus. 



Skull. — Aside from its conspicuously larger size the skull of Glos- 

 soohaga longirostris differs from that of (r. soricina in its relatively 

 longer rostrum, the sides of which are more nearly parallel, less 

 strongly arched brain-case, and in the narrowness of the backward 

 prolongation of the bony palate behind the plain of the last molar. 

 In G. soricina the width of the bony palate at the constriction im- 

 mediately behind the last molar is contained only twice in the dis- 

 tance from the latter point to the tip of the hamular. In fr. longi- 

 rostris it is contained nearly two and one-half times. 



Teeth. — In the only known specimen of Glossophnga longirostris 

 — an adult, though by no means aged individual — the incisors have 

 all been shed. Distinct traces of the alveoli can still be seen in the 

 mandible, but these are nearly obliterated in the upper jaw. 

 Whether this condition is normal, as in the genus Lichonycteris,^ it 

 is, of course, impossible to say. In much older individuals of G. sori- 

 cina and (J. truei^ the incisors are invariably present, so far as my ob- 

 servation has gone. In relative size the premolars and molars are es- 

 sentially as in G. soricina. All, however, are very distinctly nar- 

 rower. Or, in other words, the teeth have shared in the general 

 elongation of the jaws without undergoing any proportional increase 

 in width. In the lower premolars where the characters are most 

 strongly marked, the width of each tooth is appreciably less than in 

 G. soricina, while the longitudinal extent of the three together 

 exceeds the same measurement in fi. soricina by nearly one milli- 

 metre.

length, 23.4 (19.8) ;' basilar length, 19.« (16.2) ; zygcmiatic breadth, 

 10.8 (9.6) ; last molar to tip of haniular, 7 (5.6) ; last width of bony 

 palate behind molars, 2.4 (2.2) ; mandible, 15.8 (13) ; maxillary 

 tooth row, 8.2 (6.8) ; mandibular tooth row, 8.6 (7). 



(ieneral remarks. — irlossoithaga longirostrls needs no close com- 

 parison with other members of its genus. Should the early decidu- 

 ous incisors prove to be a constant character, the animal will prob- 

 ably require at least subgeneric separation from the forms related to 

 G. soricina. 



REITHRONYCTERIS gen. nov. 'Glossophaginae.) 



(reneric characters. — Dental formula (as in Fhyllonycteris), i, 

 2=2 . c, i~* ; pm, 2~2 ; jn, ^=^__32 J zygomatic arches incomplete (as 

 ill Ht-miderma) ; flour of brain-case from basisphenoid forward ele- 

 vated out of its usual position, so that the roof of the posterior nares 

 is formed by two longitudinal folds, given off by the pterygoids and 

 nearly meeting in tlie median line in the region usually occupied by 

 tiie basisphenoid and presphenoid (figures 3 and 4; : calcar ab- 

 .seiit ; nostrils perforating a disc-shaped elevation which lacks a true 

 "leaf" or free, pointed process above (the C(jnditi(ins are exactly 

 re[)roduced in UracJtyjihijlla) ; ears small and separate ; tongue 

 broader than in Phijllomjcteris and more abruptly narrowed at tip, 

 the papillie short and stiff; tail about as long as femur. 



dencral remarks. — Reithronyrtcris is a very aberrant mcmlier of 

 the sul)family (ihssap/iagiinc. Its broad teeth, heavy rostrum, mas- 

 sive lower jaw and broad tougue with short papillie remove it widely 

 from extreme forms such as Cliaronycteris and Liclioiiycteris. In 

 its reducf'd nose leaf and in the form of the miindible and of the 

 mandibular teeth it resembles Hrurliyj,hylla. Whether these char- 

 acters indicate any real affinities with the Stenodermata is, however, 

 very questionable.'' In addition to these le.-s important characters, 

 Reltliraiiycteris ditfers from all other bats with which I am ac- 

 quainted in the structure of the interpterygoid region.

Keithronycteris aphylla q>. nov. 



Type. — Adult S (in alcohol) No. 9, Museum of the Institute of 

 Jamaica. Collected in Jamaica. No further history. 



Specific characters. — External appearance much as in Fhylloiiijc- 

 teris sezekornt Peters/ but muzzle conspicuously broader and termi- 

 nating in a disc-shaped rudimentary nose leaf like that of Brachy- 

 phylla cavernarum. Feet relatively larger than in Fhyllonycteris 

 sezekorni, and interfemoral membrane much less developed. Skull 

 broader and more heavily built than that of P. sezekornl and lack- 

 ing the slender, but complete zygomatic arches often present in the 

 latter.® Teeth conspicuously shorter and broader than in Phyllo- 

 nycteris sezekorni; front lower molar very slightly larger than suc- 

 ceeding ones, not greatly elongated as in P. sezekorni. Color, of 

 specimen preserved in alcohol for an unknown period, light yellow- 

 ish brown. 



Fur and color. — The fur is short, about 6 mm. in length on mid- 

 dle of back, 4 mm. on belly ; it is very closely confined to the body, 

 barely reaching the membranes. Color both above and below light 

 yellowish brown. Ears and membranes light brown. 



Ears. — The ears are short; when laid forward they reach just 

 beyond inner canthus of eye. Anterior border strongly convex from 

 base to a little above middle, then nearly straight to narrowly 

 rounded off tip. Posterior border slightly concave below tip, then 

 convex (the curve about the same as that of anterior border) to base. 

 Posteriorbase in line with upper lip,the distance from cornerof mouth 

 a little less than from the latter point to chin. A wart (concealed 

 by the hair) about as large as eye midway between corner of mouth 

 and posterior base of ear. Inner surface of ear with seven ill de- 

 fined cross ridges. 



Tragus a little less than half height of ear. Anterior border 

 gently and evenly convex from base to acicular tip. Posterior bor- 

 der with four deep scallops, subtending as many prominent tooth 

 like projections, of which the basal is less developed than the 

 others (it does not show in the view from which figure was taken). 



Feet. — Foot very large, fully three-fourths as long as tibia, the 

 toes deeply cleft and provided with large claws. No trace of calcar. 



'This comparison is made with specimens from Nassau, Bahamas. These 

 may prove to be diflierent from the typical Cuban form. 



"Dobson. basing his description on Jamaican material, states that in /-"//////o- 

 nycteris the zygomatic arches are incomplete. This is not true of the Baha- 

 man specimens. There is little reason, however, to believe that the .Jamai- 

 can Fhyllonycteris with pointed nose leaf is the same as that found in the 

 Bahamas, and no certainty that either is true sezekorni.

Membranes. — Wings full and ami)le, at- 

 tached at middle of tibia. Uropatagium 

 reduced to a narrow frill scarcely wider 

 than the fleshy part of the thigh, and reach- 

 ing not f-juite to middle of tibia. Tail in- 

 cluded to middle in membrane. 



Tongue. — The tongue (figure ii) while 

 distinctly of the glossophagine type is con- 

 siderably broader in pro[)ortion to its length 

 than in any of the other members of the 

 L,'^roup that I have examined. At the tip it 

 narrows very abrui)tly to an unusually 

 acute point. The terminal area of elonga- 

 ted stiff papilhe has much the same general 

 shape as in Phylloinjclerin sezekorni, allow- 

 ance being made for the difference arising 

 from the greater breadth of the tongue, but 

 Fig. 2.— Head of Phyllo- the individual paplli:e are shorter and of 

 '^'^'7'*-^''-y''^/""'^\^*"'' more uniform length, so that the median 

 (b). (Slightly enlarged), groove is less conspicuous (this difference 

 is very difficult to represent in the drawing). 



Skull. — The skull < figure 3) is larger and more massively built 



than that of Phyllonyctcris or 

 any other glassophagine ge- 

 inis with which I am acquaint- 

 ed. The rostrum is esi)ecially 

 broad and deep. Face line 

 straight from nostril to iiiid<lle 

 of brain case ; a well dev^dop- 

 cd .^iagittal crest :ind lanibdoid 

 crest ; bony palate I)eliind 

 molars narrower than in I'Jnjl-

 ular proce8.ses are very bmad 

 and strongly concave intern- 

 ally, the resulting form (piite 

 different from that in I'hyllo- 

 nyd* ris or (rln.<<foj)hiign. The 

 structure of the floor of the

 part of the skull, l)ut the longitudinal folds forming the roof of the 

 posterior nares are aj)parently given off l)y the pterygoids. In fig-

Teeth. — In number and arrangement the rvgoid, ^.w^^ba- 

 teetii agree with those ofPhylloiiycteris sezekoni i, sisphenoid. 

 but in form they are even less typically glosso{)hagine, than is espe- 

 cially the case with the mandibular teeth, which strongly resemble 

 those of B raclujphylla caventarum. In relative size the teeth agree 

 with those of Pliyllonycteris sezekortii except that the front upper 

 premolar is larger, the second upper premolar smaller, and the front 

 lower molar much shorter. The lower premolars are less crowded 

 than in P. sezelornl.

General remarks. — Reithronyderlsaphylla needs close comparison 

 with only one described species, the Phyllonycteris poeyi of Gund- 

 lach.* This bat, from the " Kaffeepflanzung Fundator," Cuba, is 

 still wholly unknown except for the rather meagre original des- 

 cription. In size, color, general structure of the nose leaf, and 

 absence of calcar, it agrees very closely with Reiihronycteris

In 1891, Mr. 0. F. Cook presented to the Museum of the Leland 

 Stanford Junior University a valuable collection of fishes which he 

 had obtained on a visit to the Canary Islands. We give below an 

 annotated list of the species contained in this collection with a de-

A NEW CHIPMUNK FROM NORTHEASTERN CHINA. 

 BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



In a paper recently published iu these Proceedings (1898, pp. 

 120-125) Mr. S. N. Rhoads refers two chipmuuks from the Pro- 

 vince of Pechili, northeastern China, to Eutamias ashdicus (Gnielin). 

 Through the kindness of Mr. ^Vitmer Stone I now have the speci- 

 mens before me. They agree perfectly — allowance being made for 

 difference in pelage — with a skin in the United States National 

 Museum taken near Peking, and differ widely from published 

 descriptions of Eutamias asiaticus^ and from a skin of the latter (iu 

 the National jNIuseum) labelled ' Fort Ulba, Siberia.'* Considering 

 the isolation of the region inhabited by the Pechili Chipmunk, and 

 the extreme plasticity of the genus Eutajniax, it is not surprising 

 that the animal should prove to be distinct from its Siberian con- 

 gener. The question immediately arises, however, as to what true 

 Eutamias asiaticus really is, and at present it is impossible to give 

 a wholly satisfactory answer. Gmelin based his Sciurus striatus 

 a asiaticus primarily on the Sciurus striatum of Pallas,^ a compos- 

 ite of the Asiatic and American species, but composed chiefly of the 

 former. The range of the Asiatic animal extends, according to 

 Pallas, from the Dwina River in Russia, east through the whole of 

 Siberia. That only one species of Eutamias occurs in this vast area 

 is almost beyond the possibility of belief But however many forms 

 there may be, and whatever one Pallas may have had in hand when 

 he wrote his description, the animal that he described was approxi- 

 mately like the ' Ulba' specimen, and consequently very unlike the 

 Chinese form. Roughly speaking, the Chinese animal is a pale, 

 grayish, brown-striped form much like Eutamias merriami and E. 

 senex, while the ' Ulba ' specimen, together with those usually re- 



' See, for instance, Allen, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., Ill, pp. 71, 72, June, 

 1890. 



'This locality I have been unable to find on any map. In the Government 

 of Tomsk, however, there is a river whose name is variously spelled as Uba, 

 Ouba and Ooba. The name on the Museum label may be a lapsus pennse 

 for Uba.

garded as true asiaticits, resembles the members of the brightly col- 

 ored, black-striped quadrivlttatus group. That Tallas had before 

 him a specimen of the latter type, is clearly proved by his excellent 

 description. The back he says is marked with five black stripes, 

 of which the middle one extends from nape to base of tail, the outer 

 from shoulder to thigh.* The specific name aslaticus, based on this 

 description, is obviously inapjilicable to an animal which has only 

 one, or at most three, black dorsal stripes. The Chinese form, on 

 account of its striking resemblance to the American Eutaviias seiiex 

 may be called :

Type.— Aduh 9 (skin and skull) No. 83,395, United States 

 National Museum, collected August 21, 1896, on low barren hills 

 fifteen miles west of Peking, China, by Geo. D. Wilder. 



General characters. — Much paler and grayer than Eutamias 

 asiaticits; only the middle part of central dark stripe constantly 

 black; feet larger than in a specimen of supposed «.«/(///>«« from 

 ' Fort Ulba, Siberia.' 



Color. — Type specimen in fresh postnuptial pelage: sides pale 

 yellowish-brown, becoming grizzly gray at shoulders, rump tinged 

 with orange rufous ; crown slightly browner than shoulders and 

 nape; sides of head yellowish-gray, with the usual stripes, the latter 

 light brown and ill defined ; ears concolor with crown, a whitish 

 stri[)e along posterior border on outer .■^ide, a faint yellowish wash 

 within, belly soiled whiti.-h ; tail with three bands of color, a broad, 

 pale yellowish, median area, followed by a black subterminal band 

 and a white border, the pattern very distinct beneatli but obscured 

 on the dorsal surface, where in addition to the three color bands 

 normally present, the hairs have dueky bases ; median dorsal stripe 

 extending from nape to base of tail, dusky l)rown anteriorly, becom- 

 ing black near middle and fading to pale reddish-brown posteriorly ; 

 second stripe shorter and slightly [)aler than first; outer stripe 

 broader than either of the others, much paler and less well defined ; 

 outer white stripe dusky whitish (about like belly), slightly broader

than inner, which is much the same color as grizzle of neck and 

 shoulders; whole' back sprinkled with black and reddish luiirs, the 

 latter most numerous along the edges of the dark stripes. 



Adult female in worn winter pelage (No. 4,601, Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadeljihia, Tung Ching Tzu, Pechili, China, 

 May 30, 1897. Skin considerably over-stuffed) : ground color 

 throughout much paler than in the type, rump scarcely tinged with 

 reddish ; dark stripes on both head and body more conspicuous ; 

 the second dorsal stripe black in middle, the median white stripes 

 paler; tail much less bushy but similar in arrangement of colors, 

 except at base where new hairs are coming in. The other specimen 

 ( $ ad. No. 4,602, Sian Lang Kou, Pechili, China, June 18, 1897), 

 likewise in worn winter pelage is similar to the last, but a shade less 

 pallid. 



Measurements. — The material at hand furnishes a rather unsatis- 

 factory basis for measurements. The following, however, are fairly 

 accurate. ' 



The 'FortUlba' specimen measures: hind foot, 36 ; front foot, 

 20. 



General remarks. — The cranial characters of Eutamias senesceiu 

 have been sufficiently described by i\Ir. Rhoads in his paper, to 

 which reference has already been made.

DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW RODENTS FROM THE OLYMPIC 

 MOUNTAINS, WASHINGTON. 



BY C HART MERRIAM. 



Owing to an unavoidable delay in the publication of ray report 

 on the Olympic Mountains, it seems desirable that the following new 

 species of mammals should be recorded as early as practicable. 

 Arctomys olympus f\<. n«v. 



Type. — From Timberliue at head of Soleduc River, Olympic 

 Mountains, Washington. No. 90,518, ^ ad. U. S. Nat. Mus. Bio- 

 logical Survey Coll. Collected August 27, 1897, by C Hart Mer- 

 riam and Vernon Bailey. Original No. 6,210. 



Characters. — Size and general characters as in A. caligahis, from 

 ■which it differs markedly in color, the feet being brown instead of 

 black, and upper parts in summer pelage uniform dull ochraceous 

 yellow, without the hoary shoulders and fore back, dark posterior 

 back, or the blackish top of head of that species. 



Color. — Entire upper parts except ears and nose, dull buffy or 

 ochraceous yellowish, becoming brown on underparts ; ears and feet 

 brown ; chin and nose white, with a dark bar across face between 

 nose and eyes. This face bar is probably absent in full summer 

 pelage, and indicates the beginning of the fall change to blackish 

 pelage. 



Measurements. — Type specimen, S ad., measured in flesh : Total 

 length, 750 ram. ; tail vertebrc'e, 210 mm. ; hind foot, 110 mm. 

 Eatamias canrinus ':[>. nov. 



Type. — From Tiraberline near head of Soleduc River, Olympic 

 Mountains, Washmgton. No. 90,636, S ad. U. S. Nat. ]\Ius. Bio- 

 logical Survey Coll. Collected August 27, 1897, by C Hart Mer- 

 riara. Original No. 6,211. 



Characters. — (Type specimen in post breeding [)elage — molt not 

 completed posteriorly). Similar to E-awr/nus, but hind feet longer; 

 underside of tail with black border broader, and median chestnut- 

 fulvous band darkened by mixture of black hairs ; post-auricular 

 patches obsolete ; face stripes duller ; l>ack of neck not grayish or 

 hoary, but grizzled with fulvous, like shoulders ; middle pair of 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 853 



pale dorsal stripes less sharply defined anteriorly and everywhere 

 mixed with fulvous hairs. 



Measurements. — Type specimen measured in flesh : Total length, 

 210 mm. ; tail vertebrse, 85 mm. ; hind foot, 34 mm. 

 Microtus macrurus sji. nor. 



Type. — From Lake Cushman, Olympic Mountains, Washington. 

 No. 66,151 9 ad., U. S. Nat. Mus. Biological Survey Coll. Col- 

 lected June 26, 1894, by Clark P. Streator. Original number 3,975. 



Characters. — Similar to M mordux but larger, with longer tail 

 and decidedly larger hind feet ; color darker. 



Color. — Upper parts brownish bister with a grizzled ' pepper and 

 salt ' appearance, suggesting M. austems ; under parts wliitish, the 

 plumbeous under-fur showing through ; tail bicolor, dusky above, 

 whitish below, the tip sometimes white, sometimes dusky all round. 

 In summer pelage the back is browner and the under parts are 

 washed with buffy. 



Cranial characters. — Skull similar to that of M. 7norda.c, but 

 slightly larger, with rostrum and nasals slightly broader. 



MensuremenU. — Type specimen : Total length, 220 mm. ; tail ver- 

 tebra-, 88 mm. ; hind foot, 24 mm. Average of 5 specimens from 

 Olympic Mountains: Total length, 204 mm.; tail vertebrse, 80; 

 hit'ul foot 24-3. 



Average of 5 specimens of JA viurdax from Saw Tooth Lake, 

 Idaho : Total length, 182 mm. ; tail vertebra, 66*5 ; hind foot, 22. 



Remarks. — In coloration Microtus mncrnrus agrees closely with 

 M. lonfjicu}idH.-< from the Black Ilill.s of South Dakota, but in size 

 and proportions it differs from longicaudus even more than from 

 mordax. All three of these animals are very clo.=<ely related, and it 

 would not be far amiss if ijoth mordax and 7/t«cri(r«« were jilaccd as 

 subspecies of lonr/icaudiis.

A NEW LAND SHELL FROM CLARION ISLAND. 



IJY ireNRY A riLSKKY. 

 Suocinea Mcgregori n. sp. 



Shell ovate, thin, red-amber colored, irreguhirly wrinkled-striate, 

 composed of 3i very convex whorls separated by deeply 

 impresj^ed sutures. Aperture two-thirds the length of the 

 shell, reguhirly ovate, oblique, its width contained H 

 times in its length ; columella arcuate, its edge thread like 

 above. 



Alt. lok, diara. 8, length of aperture 9 mm. 



Alt. 12*, diam. 7, length of aperture 8i mm. 



Clarion Island, collected by Mr. R. C. iNIcGregor, in whose honor 

 the species is named. 



This species closely resembles S, Donneil Pfr. from Chili in form, 

 but differs in color, the Chilian species being pale yellowish corneous. 

 It has the deep reddish hue of many Hawaiian Succineas, such as 5. 

 cnnella Gld., or the Japanese group to which «S'. laiUa belongs. S. 

 Oregonensis Lea is decidedly shorter and not of so dark a color. 



At my request Mr. McGregor furnished the following notes on 

 Clarion Island : 



" Clarion Island is some three hundred miles southwest of Cape 

 San Lucas. The sandy beaches are covered with broken coral. 

 Back of the beach where we landed is level ground for a quarter of 

 a mile, covered in places with cacti and vines {Ipomcca catliarfica 

 Poir., Phaseolus atropurpiireus D. C. and Sophora tomentosa Ij.). 

 The troublesome bush, Caesalpinia Bondxicella Roxb., with its sharp, 

 curved spines, abounds on the hillsides and the flats. The interior 

 of the island rises in more or less rough hills. There are quite a 

 number of elevated flats or plateaux covered with a tangle of vines, 

 gra.sses and shrubs. Among the last are Euphorbia Clarionensis 

 Brandegee and E. Californiea Benth., on the stems of which was 

 found the only land shell. This mollusk clo.sely resembles the bark 

 of these plants, and was very abundant. One might collect twenty 

 or thirty specimens from a .single plant. 



"Clarion Island is decidedly tropical, though it includes in its 

 fauna insular forms of birds of such temperate zone genera as Speo- 

 tyto, Zenaldura and Troglodytes. There are no mammals on the is- 

 land. Lizards and several species of snakes were captured."

The following biographical note was presented l)y the Committe 

 on the Haydeu Memorial Award : 



Otto Martin Torell. — Born in Varberg in Sweden, the oth of 

 June, 1828, he passed the examination for entrance into the Uni- 

 versity of Lund in 1814, and was made Doctor of Philosophy, 1853. 

 He then turned his attention to medical studies, and passed the sec- 

 ond examination for physicians in the year 1858. He became 

 Adjunct Professor of Zoology in 1860, and in 1806 was nominated 

 as Professor of Zoology and Geology at the University of Lund. 

 He soon left the University for Stockholm, and was in 1871 ap- 

 pointed Chief of the Geological Survey of Sweden, which office he 

 resigned some months ago. 



In 1856 he visited Switzerland with the object of studying the 

 glaciers, and in ixdl he made a voyage to Iceland with the .same 

 view. His main j)urpose was to detern)ine whether it is probable 

 that glaciers formerly covered the whole of Scandinavia. 



In 1858, in comi>any with A. E. Nordenskiold, he went to Spitz- 

 bergen for the first tinje, and the following year to Greenland. 

 The.se voyages may be said to have led to the Swedish Polar E.xpe- 

 ditions, and Torell was him.-*elf the leader or manager of the first of 

 these of any importance, namely, the expedition to Spitzbergen in 

 1861, which was very rich in scientific results. 



The most important i)art of his work at Spitzbergen was his deep 

 sea investigations with the grapnel, which were executed in order to 

 study the animal life at the bottom of the sea (2,5U0 meters l)elow 

 the surface), a depth from which before that time only foraminifers 

 had been obtained. This discovery afterwards led to many re- 

 searches of the sea bottom, through which, one may say, a new era 

 has arisen in the history of the geology and pliysical geography of 

 the ocean bed. 



Partly for scientific studies and partly as a member of geological 

 and geographical congresses. Professor Torell has made many jour- 




35fi PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



neys to Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Belgium, 

 Holland, England, and the United States. 



He was one of the first Swedish naturalists to accept the glacial 

 theory in ])lace of the theory (by Sefstrom) of the " rullstensflod." 

 Of his works, those which treat of the ice period are the most im- 

 portant. To these, belong " Contribution to the molluscan fauna, 

 with a general view of the natural state of the Arctic Regions," 

 (1859); "Investigations of the Ice Period," 1,(1873), 2,(1873), 

 and 3, (1887) ; and " On the causes of glacial phenomena in the 

 northeastern portion of North America." 



Partly by these works and partly by lectures Torell has, in Swe- 

 den as abroad, powerfully contributed to the dissemination of the 

 theory that the territory of northern Europe, where great blocks of 

 Scandinavian rocks have been found, was formerly covered by land 

 ice, extending from Scandinavia, like the ice in Greenland at the 

 present time, and not, as had been formerly supposed, by a frozen 

 sea (Eismeer). 



Among other works of Torell may be mentioned : " On geologi- 

 cal researches in Norway," (1865) ; " Contribution to the geognosy 

 and paleontology of the Spargu rite Stages," (1867); "Petrificata 

 Suecana formationis Cambricpe," (1870); "Sur les traces les plus 

 anciennes de I'existence de I'homme en Su6de," (1876) ; " On the 

 most important crystalline minerals," (1882); "The deposits on 

 both sides of the boundary between Sweden and Norway," (1888). 

 In 1868 the Scientific Society in Haarlem awarded to him its first 

 prize for his work on the origin of the diluvial deposits at Gronin- 

 gen in Holland. 



Dr. Torell is a member of the Royal Society of Sciences of Swedens 

 (1870), of the Agricultural Academy (1872), and of many other 

 scientific societies in Sweden and abroad. 



He is Commander of the Swedish " North Star ; " Grand Oflficer 

 of the Italian Order of the Crown ; Knight of the second class of 

 the Russian Order of St. Anna ; Commander of the Danish Dann6- 

 brog; Officer of Public Instruction and Officier de la Legion

358 PROCKEDINGS OF THK ACADKMY OF [1898. 



NOTES ON THE ARCTIC RED-BACKED MICE. 

 BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



" We challenge the proof that Mas rntilus is not a circumpolar 

 species." *The view thus forcibly expressed by Dr. Elliott Cones 

 twenty-one years ago' fairly represents current opinion in regard to 

 the Arctic Red-backed Mice, at least so far as concerns those of 

 Alaska and the Old World. From time to time during this period, 

 Evotoinys rujocanus has been recognized as a distinct form ; but 

 Evotomys rutilns is universally regarded as an exceptionally homo- 

 geneous and wide-ranging circumpolar species. Writing of the 

 Ked-backed Mice in 1897, Mr. Vernon Bailey says : " The only 

 circumpolar species [of Evotomys] is the Arctic E. rntilus, which 

 does not undergo any considerable change throughout the cir- 

 cumference of the Arctic zone."" 



A recent examination of the Arctic red-backed mice in the Uni- 

 ted States National Museum convinces me that the Evotomys rutihis 

 of authors is far from the unvarying species that it has been repre- 

 sented. While the material at hand is too limited to form the 

 basis of anything like a final revision, it clearly proves the distinct- 

 ness of Evotomys ri(foca7ius, and also the existence of three forms of 

 so-called rutilm, one in the extreme north of Euroj)e, one in Kam- 

 tschatka, and one in Alaska. 



The Mus rutilns of Pallas came from Siberia immediately east of 

 the Obi. As no specimens from this region are available for com- 

 parison, the question of the exact identity of the species must, for 

 the time being, remain open. Geographical considerations lead me 

 to apply the name rutihis provisionally to the most westerly of the 

 Old World forms rather than to the one occurring in Kamtschatka. 

 The latter is the Arvicola ivosnessenskli of PolyakofT. Its identity 

 with Richardson's Arvicola rubricatns from Bering Strait, is too un- 

 certain to be worthy of serious consideration at present. The lat- 

 ter is described as slate color on the back, and nearly scarlet on 

 the sides — a color pattern quite unknown in the genus Evotomys.

Even if it be assumed, as Baird has suggested,' that the colors of 

 the back aud sides were accidentally transposed in Richardson's 

 description, the case is not much helped, since no known member of 

 the rutihis group has slate colored sides. Although Baird assumed 

 that Richardson's animal cauje from Siberia, the statement in the 

 original description that it " appears to be quite distinct from any 

 American meadow mouse hitherto described," leads to the belief 

 that the type locality was on the Alaskan side of the strait. The 

 objections to applying the name to the Alaskan animal are, how- 

 ever, no less than in the case of the Kamtschatkan species. 



The general characters of Evotoviys rujocmms, and of the three 

 species hitherto confused under the name rutihis, are given in the 

 following synopsis : 



Teeth large and heavy as in Microtus (never perfectly rooted ?) ; 

 molar rows about 6.5 mm. ; posterior lower molar long, some- 

 what encapsulated ; skull with prominent j)()Storbital j)rocesses ; 



sides clear gray (highly aberrant) E.rufocanns. 



Teeth small and weak (perfectly rooted in adult); molar rows 

 about 5 mm. ; posterior lower molar short, not encapsulated ; 

 skull without prominent postorbital processes; sides strongly 

 fulvous (^typical Evotoinys). 



.Skull narrow ; rostral protuberances standing out conspicu- 

 ously from root of zygoma (fig, 1 n) ; audital bulla- sniall ; 



feet slender E. irosucssciiskii. 



Skull broad ; rostral protuberances not standing out con- 

 spicuously from root of zygoma (fig. 1 b) ; audital buiht- 

 large ; feet broad. 



Nasal bones short, contained 3^ times in greatest length 

 of skull ; tail 34-40 mm. ; color generally chestnut 



E. riiti/us. 



Nasal bones long, contained oidy 3 times in greatest 



length of skull ; tail 20-30 nun. ; c<»lor generally dull 



ferruginous E. aldJ'reniiis.

Skull. — The only skull oi EvtitomyifruJ'ocnnu.^ that I have at hand 

 is badly damaged. Nevertheless it shows strong characters to dis-

tinguish it from that of E. rutilus, or in fact from any other known 

 member of the genus. The anterior edge of the squamosal is pro- 

 duced to form a very distinct postorbital process, quite as in many 

 species of Microtns. The mandible is massively built and, like the 

 skull, shows a degree of angularity more in keeping with Microtus 

 than Evotomya. The palate, although damaged, appears to be that 

 of typical Evotomys. ^Ir. Bailey says of this species : " Ei'otomys 

 riifocanus (Sundevall) of northern Europe is remarkable for its large 

 molars and almost microtine form of skull." He gives the follow- 

 ing measurements of a skull from Lapland : basal length, 25 mm. ; 

 nasals, 7.6; zygomatic breadth, 15 ; mastoid breadth, 12.2; alveo- 

 lar length of upper molar series 6.7. 



Teeth. — The teeth of Evotomys riifocanus are chiefly remarkable 

 for their large size and great strength. Their development rela- 

 tively to the'size of the skull is more in accord with the proportions 

 normal in Microtus than in Evotomys. Apparently the molars do 

 not develop as complete roots as in other species of Evotomys. The 

 root of the lower incisor is nearly as long as in some species of 

 Microtus, and the long back lower molar is encapsulated, though 

 not conspicuously so. The enamel pattern (fig. 2 d) differs widely 

 from that of Evotomys rutilus (fig. 2 a). Its most striking peculiar- 

 ities are the simplicity of the posterior upper molar, and the shallow 

 reentrant angles on the outer side of the posterior lower molar. 



Color. — A specimen in fresh autumnal pelage has a well defined 

 dorsal stripe of a color intermediate between the hazel and cinna- 

 mon rufous of Ridgway. This stripe begins between the eyes and 

 extends back nearly to base of tail. Ears colored like dorsal stripe. 

 Sides an indescribable grizzle of hair brown, whitish, black, and 

 slate color. Whole under parts soiled buffy-white, darkened by the 

 slaty bases of the hairs, which show through irregularly on the sur- 

 face. Cheeks, muzzle, and sides of head similar to sides of body, 

 but slightly darker. Tail sharply bicolor, brownish above, dirty 

 white below. Feet dirty whitish. 



Genernl remarks. — j\[r. Bailey has already called attention to the 

 fact that Evotomys rufocanus " is the most divergent form of the 

 genus known." So divergent is the animal that it may well be 

 questioned whether it is to be regarded as a true Evotomys. Its 

 heavy and apparently imperfectly rooted teeth more closely resem- 

 ble those of many species of typical Microtus than they do the weak, 

 perfectly rooted teeth of true Evotomys. The relationships of the

root of the lower incisor and the posterior lower molar, while not 

 typical of either genus are clearly suggestive of Microius rather 

 than Evotomys. The palate structure, on the other hand, appears 

 to agree with that of Evotomy-''. The question of the animal's true 

 position cannot be answered until good series of specimens represent- 

 ing different ages are available for comparison.

Skull. — The skull of Evotomys wosnessenskii as compared with 

 that of E. rufilus and E. alascensis is slightly narrower and more 

 depressed, thougli the differences in general form are not very strik- 

 ing. The anterior edges of the aiitorbital foramina are folded out- 

 ward so as to form conspicuous swellings, which for want of a bet- 

 ter name I have called rostral protuberances. These protul)erances 

 are a[)parcntly formed by the wall of a canal which takes a super- 

 ficial downward course from tlie anterior edge of the antorl)ital for- 

 amen, and probably transmits a branch of the fifth nerve. In Evo- 

 tomys wosnessenskii the rostral protuberances stand further forward 

 from the bases of the zygomata than in E. alasce)isis (fig. 1). This 



position as well as their large size makes 

 them very cuiispicuoiis. Audita) bullie 

 small, much smaller than in E. nUilus or 

 E. alascensis, their greatest lircadth about 

 equal to alveolar length of maxillary 

 tooth row. Mandible slender and lightly 

 built, with weaker articular process and' 

 angular process than in the related species.

Teeth. — The teeth of Evotomys u'osnessenskii (fig. 2 b) present no 

 characters of special importance. 



Ears. — The ears are slightly smaller than in E. alascensis, but 

 not peculiar in form. 



Feet. — The hind feet are slender and much less densely furred 

 than in E. alascensis. The latter character at first sight appears to 

 be due to season, as most of the National Museum specimens of E. 

 wosnessenskii were taken in summer, while the Alaskan series is 

 chiefly composed of October skins. Several of the Kamtschatkan 

 specimens Avere, however, taken during the last week in September, 

 and one ablate as October 8th. In none of these does the hairiness 

 of the hind foot closely approach the condition found in Alaskan 

 specimens taken from three weeks to a month later. 



Tail. — The tail is more slender than in E. alascensis, and less 

 densely haired than in either E. alascensis or E. rutilns. The diflfer- 

 ence is fully apparent on comparison of specimens in winter pelage. 



Color. — Autumnal specimens have the dorsal stripe a clear, deep, 

 tawny, finely and inconspicuously sprinkled with black. Sides 

 ochraceous buflT. Belly dull whitish, faintly darkened by the slaty 

 bases of the hairs. Summer adults are essentially similar, but im- 

 mature specimens are much darker and duller. 



Measurements. — For measurements of Evotomys ivosnessenskii see 

 table, page 366. 



Speciinens examined. — Total number of specimens examined 26, 

 from the following localities : 



Karatschatka : Bering Island, 17; Kalakhtyrka, 1 ; Petropaul- 

 ski, 6 ; no definite locality, 2. 



General remarks. — Evotomys wosnessenskii is more distinct from 

 E. rutilus and E. alascensis than either of these is from the other. 

 Aside from its cranial characters it is easily distinguishable from its 

 allies by its slender, thinly haired tail and feet.

 Skull. — In the north European Evotomys to which I have pro- 

 visionally restricted the name rutilus, the skull closely resembles 

 that of E. alascensis, except that the rostral protuberances are placed 

 further forward, as in E. wosnessenskii, and the nasal bones are 

 shorter relatively to the length of the skull. In E. alascensis the 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 363 



nasal bones form about 33.3 percent of the occipitonasal lenutli, 

 while in E. rutihis they form about 28.5 percent only. The difier- 

 ence is due to the less backward extent of the nasals in E. rutilus, 

 rather than to any actual shortening of the rostrura. Audital bullse 

 large and rounded as in E. alasceiisis, very different from those of 

 E. uvsnessenskii. 



Measurements of an adult skull from Lapland: greatest length, 

 24 mm. ; basal length, 22.4 ; basilar length, 20.6 ; zygomatic breadth, 

 13; mastoid breadth, 11.8 ; interorhital constriction, 4; nasals, 7; 

 incisive foramen, 5 ; diastema, 7.4 ; maxillary molar series (alve- 

 oli), 5 ; mandible, 13.8 ; mandibular molar series (alveoli), 5. 



Teeth. — The teeth of Evotomys rutilus (fig. 2 a) do not differ ap- 

 preciably from those of £". ivo.s)iesse7iskii and E. alascensis. 



Ears, feet and tail. — So far as can be judged from dry skins the 

 ears of Evotomys rutilus do not differ appreciably in form from those 

 of E. alascensis and E. uvsnessenskii. They are, however, ap- 

 parently a trifle larger than in the latter. Feet broad, as in the 

 Alaskan form. Tail about as in E. alascensis, but considerably 

 longer and somewhat less densely haired. 



Color. — An adult male from northern Sweden taken in December 

 and another specimen from same region but without date, agree 

 very closely in color. Both have the dorsal stripe a clear bright 

 chestnut, faintly darkened by a slight admixture of black-tipped 

 hairs. The sides are ochraceous-buff, and the belly dirty white or 

 cream color. Feet whitish ; ears chestnut. Tail sharply bicolor, 

 brownish, tinged with red above, dirty white below. Fur every- 

 where f^laty plunil)eoud at ba.'-e, this color appearing irregularly at 

 surface on belly and sides. Two other undated skins from Lap- 

 land are slightly j)aler in color. 



Measurements — For measurements of Evotomys rutilus see table, 

 page 366. 



Specimens examined. — Four, from the following localities: 



Lapland: no definite locality, 2. 



Sweden : Karesnando, 1; no definite locality (northern Sweden), 1.

Type. — Adult $ , number ^sImI United States National Museum, 

 collected at St. Michael's, Alaska, October 26, 1897, by E. W. Nel- 

 son. Original number, 96. 



General characters. — See synopsis, page 359. 



Skull. — The skull of Evotomys alascensu more closely resembles 

 that oi E. rutilus than it does that of its geographically nearer ally 

 E. wosnessenskii. The brain case is broad and squarish in outline. 

 Squamosals produced into very small, pointed postorbital processes. 

 Audital bullae large, their greatest breadth considerably more than 

 alveolar length of maxillary molar series. Rostral protuberances 

 (fig. 1 b) much closer to roots of zygomata than in either of the Old 

 "World species. The nasal bones (fig. 1) are longer than in either 

 E. rutilus or E. wosnessenskii. This difference is not due to greater 

 length of rostrum, but to greater backward prolongation of the nasal 

 bones. The nasal branches of the premaxillaries also extend fur- 

 ther back than in either of the Old World forms. 



The skull of the type specimen measures : greatest length, 25 mm ; 

 basal length 22.6; basilar length, 21.8; zygomatic breadth, 13.4; 

 mastoid breadth, 11.6 ; interorbital constriction, 4.6 ; nasals, 8; in- 

 cisive foramen, 5 ; diastema, 7 ; maxillary molar series (alveoli), 

 5.2; mandible, 14; mandibular molar series (alveoli), 5. 



Teeth. — The enamel pattern (fig. 2 c) is essentially as in Old 

 World Arctic species. 



Ears. — The ears do not differ in form from those of E. rutilus and 

 E. wosnessenskii, but they are appreciably larger than in the lat- 

 ter. 



Feet. — The front feet present no characters of importance. The 

 hind feet, like those of E. rutilus, are short, broad, and very densely 

 haired both above, on the sides, and below. On the sole the hair 

 extends from the heel to the middle row of tubercles. 



Color. — In the type the dorsal stripe is dull ferruginous sprinkled 

 with black hairs, which, however, are very inconspicuous. Sides

 from the following localities :

General remarks. — Evotomy.-< alascensis appears to be more closely 

 related to the European E. rutiliis than to the Kamtschatkan E. 

 ivosnessenskii or to any of the American species. It has the broad 

 skull, large audital bulke and broad feet of E. rxdilus, but differs 

 from both European and Kamtschatkan species in its long nasal 

 bones, and in the positi6n of the rostral protuberances.

DESCRIPTION Oy A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF MICROTINE RODENT 

 FROM SIBERIA. 



BY GERRIT S. MILLER, JR. 



Before the first ocean telegraph cable was laid, the Western 

 Union Telegraph Company organized an expedition to investigate 

 the practicability of an overland international line by way of Alaska 

 and Siberia. A few mammals were collected during this explora- 

 tion, and among them is a mouse representing an undescribed genus 



and species. It was 

 taken at Plover Bay, 

 Bering Strait, Siberia. 

 In general appearance 

 this animal resembles a 

 lemming. So close is 

 the likeness that the spe- 

 cimen remained for 

 many years in the Na- 

 tional Museum collec- 

 tion labelled ' Myodes.' 

 Recently, however, Mr. 

 F. W. True detected the 

 error in identification 

 and referred the subject 

 to me for further study. 

 I find that the species, 

 while possessing no im- 

 portant characters not 

 found in 3Iicrofus and 

 Evotomys, yet combines 

 the peculiarities of these 

 Fig. 1. .-Kuu oi A.chizomys lenun.nu, (x 2). ^^^ ^^^^j.^^ g^ perfectly 



that it is necessary either to recognize the new form as an annectant 

 genus, or to reduce Evotomys to the rank of a subgenus of Microtm, 

 and treat the Plover Bay animal as still another subgenus. While 

 the latter course would be the more logical, it would involve the 

 serious inconvenience of uniting two large, widely spread, and else- 

 where sharply defined genera. Hence I prefer the first alternative.

ASCHIZ0MY8 gen. nov. (Mtcrotina).

Generic characters. — Skull (fig. 1) broad, depressed, lightly built, 

 smooth and rounded. Palate as in true Evotomys} Molars small 

 and weak, their angles rounded as in Evotomys (fig. 2), but the teeth 

 growing from a persistent pulp as in Microtus (fig. 3). Lower 

 incisor with long root (nearly as in Microtus) 



which strongly displaces root of large poste* ^ ,^ 



rior lower molar (fig. 4j. Form leniming- v^^

 pencil nearly as long as vertebrx^ Plantar 

 tubercles .six. Number of maramie unknown. 



Remarks. — As already intimated, the 

 proper disposition of this genus is open to 

 serious question. It must be recognized as 

 an intermediate between Evolomy.* and Mi- ^^^^ 

 crotits, but opinions may well vary between ^^^ 

 the logical course of combining all three (^( 

 under one generic name, and the convenient (r^ 

 e.xpeciient of allowing each to i?tand iis a full 

 genus. For the present I have chosen the p.^^. ^ Enamel pat- 

 latter course. A third alternative would be turn of A fchizomyfi icm- 

 to remove from Microtus and unite with """"*• (^ !")• 

 Aitchizomys the subgenera Eotlieiioviys' and Anteliomy-*^ in which the 

 palate structure of EvoUjmys is e.xactly reproduced. With these 

 might be joined the highly aberrant Evotomys rufocaniut} This would 

 not only remove anomalous forms from Microtus and Evotomys, but 

 would al.-o create a fairly homogeneous grou}» characterized l)y the 

 combination of shelf like palate with long-rooted lower incisor and 

 encapsulated posterior lower molar. When goo<i material represent- 

 ing all the<e quc-tionable forms can be brought U»gether, wjme such 

 course as this may prove necessary.

hung with white hairs. Tail club-shaped. Whiskers long, reach- 

 ing to the shoulder. 



Fur and color. — The fur is everywhere dense, soft and silky, that 

 on the back about 10 mm. in length ; on the belly it is nearly as 

 long. Throughout the pelage the hairs are slate-gray at base. On 

 the back the slaty portion occupies about the basal two-thirds of the 

 hairs. Beyond this is a narrow subterminal band of pale yellowish 

 wood-brown. The extreme tips of the hairs are sepia. The result- 

 ing surface color is a fine grizzle of sepia and yellowish-brown, very 

 uniform throughout the dorsal surface. There is no indication of a 

 darker dorsal area, but the shading is slightly heavier across the 

 lumbar region than elsewhere. In front of each ear is an indistinct 

 tuft of whitish hairs. Sides, belly, all four feet and legs, and under 

 side of tail light straw-yellow, sharply defined from color of dorsal 

 surface. 



This description can be only approximately correct, since it is 

 taken from the skin which had been immersed in alcohol for many 

 years. 



Tail. — Before skinning, the tail was club-shaped, and in its pres- 

 ent condition it retains a trace of this form. For a short distance 



* From notes made by Mr. F. W. True before the specimen was removed 

 from alcohol.

at base it is covered with short, loose hairs, similar in texture lo 

 those of the body. Near the middle of the tail the hairs become 

 abruptly much elongated, stitTeued and strongly directed backward. 

 The pencil thus formed is nearly as long as the tail 

 ■>^ vertebrae. It is distinctly flattened from above. 

 >. "\ The general appearance of the tail is much like 

 that of Dicrostonyx, but it is even more bushy 

 than in average specimens of any lemming. 



Skull. — In general form the skull (fig. 1) is 

 ^^ \ nuich like that of Evotomijs alasce7isis, though it is 



v" \ considerably larger. The rostrum is more taper- 



\ \^ ing than in E. alascejisis, and the rostral protuber-

BOTANICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE MEXICAN FLORA, ESPECIALLY 

 ON THE FLORA OF THE VALLEY OF MEXICO. 



BY JOHN W. HARSHBERGER, PH. D. 



Leaving Philadelpliia, Tuesday August 4, 1896, for a botanical 

 excursion to Mexico, the capital of the Republic was reached Tues- 

 day August 11th, at 6 p. m. Several stops were made en route, one 

 at St. Louis, where the Missouri Botanical Garden was visited, and 

 one at Eagle Pass, Texas, where Sunday was spent. During the 

 sojourn in the City of Mexico, numerous botanical trips were made 

 into the surrounding country in company with Mr. C. G. Pringle, 

 to whom I extend my most hearty thanks for much kindness and 

 suggestive help. The itinerary is herewith given. 



ITINERARY'. 



August 12, 1896, {Wednesday). — Visited a number of the lots in 

 the City of Mexico, where cattle and burros are allowed to roam at 

 will, and where a number of interesting plants were collected. 



August 13th, (Thursday). — Mr. Pringle, Tranquelino Duran, a 

 Mexican boy, and the writer visited Salazar by the National Railroad. 

 Salazar is situated on the crest of the western mountain ridge, 

 known as the Siejra de las Cruces. Here was fought, in 1810, the 

 battle between Hidalgo and the Spaniards, resulting in a victory for 

 the patriots. Salazar is situated at an elevation of from 10,000 to 

 11,000 feet above sea level. Many cool springs gush from the hill- 

 sides, mostly denuded of timber, and many alpine plants were found 

 in the upland meadows. 



August 15th, (Saturday). — Tlalpam was visited this day. In 

 reaching this town, we passed through Cherubusco, made famous by 

 the fight there between the Americans and Mexicans. Tlalpam is 

 a quiet suburban town of some 7,000 inhabitants, fourteen miles 

 south of the City of Mexico. There are many flower and fruit gar- 

 <iens hereabouts, for the supply of the city markets; important fac- 

 tories of cotton, woollen cloth and paper are in the neighborhood. 

 The eastern road from Tlalpam leads to Lake Xochimilclio, wiiere 

 we gathered the several interesting aquatics found on and near the 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 373 



chinampas. The botanist must needs hire a canoe to procure speci- 

 mens. The town is a verital)le Venice. 



August 17, (Monday). — The town and hills of Guadalupe, the 

 Cerro de Tepeyac and Cerro de Gachupines visited, and a number 

 of noteworthy plants collected. Guadalupe, some three miles north 

 of the capital, is reached by tram-cars from the Plaza Mayor, and 

 is interesting on account of the Sacred Chapel of Xuestra Senora de 

 Guadalupe. 



Augmt ISth, {Tue-^day). — An interesting locality visited this day 

 was that of LaCima near the summit of Ajusco at about 10,000 

 feet elevation. The hill above the Indian town afforded more plants 

 than could be conveniently carried. The pedregal in the neighbor- 

 hood also yielded a rich harvest. 



August 20th, (Thursday). — This day was spent in the neighbor- 

 hood of Tlalpam, where the fields and ditches yielded a rich supply 

 of plants. The edge of the Tlalj)am pedregal was visited, and the 

 interesting plants of the northern portion of the lava-bed collected 

 and noted. 



August 22d, (Saturday). — Another trip was made to the Tlalpam 

 pedregal and to the hills beyond. In the j)edregal, Senecio praecox 

 DC, Cereus serpentinus and Wigandia were noted, and specimens 

 collected for future study at home. 



August J.'fth, (Tuesday). — The pedregal of Tlalpam extending to 

 Tizapan, the lava bed was visited in the neighboriiood of that town. 

 Here the plants were found in the same abundance as lower down 

 the mountain .<ide, so that tlie j)edregal in all it.-* parts may be said 

 to l)e a veritable flower garden. 



Augxtst 26th, (Wednesday). — The writer left the City of Mexico 

 for the Mexican tro|)ics, via the Mexican Railroad to Orizaba and 

 Cordoba; the next few days were spent amid the tropical luxuriance 

 of the Mexican flora. Epiphytic orchids and other intercepting 

 plants were collected about Orizaba and in the neighborhood of the 

 waterfall called Rincon Grande. 



August 2.9th, (Satunlay). — Returned to the City of Mexico, where 

 the plants collected in the tierra calicnte were preserved, some in 

 formalin, others by drying. 



.{xgust -list, (}fo>iilaii). — Visited the Tlalpam pedregal on the 

 Mexican, Cuernavaca and I'acific Railroad at a much higher ele- 

 vation than formerly visited, at about 9,000 feet. Here Dahlias 

 were found in the greatest profusion and abundance. Returning 




374 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



down the inouutain side after a rougli tninij) over the pedregal, we 

 took a train for the City at Eslava, where a number of plants were 

 found. 



September 1st, (Tuesday). — LefttheCity of Mexico alone en route 

 for Guadalajara via Irapuato, where a number of days (September 2d 

 to September 5th) were spent. The celebrated barranca was visited 

 in company with an Indian, and a number of plants collected. 



September oth-September 9, 1806. — This time was profitably spent 

 in a trip to Tampico on the Gulf Coast.' En route the beautiful 

 Tamasopo Canon was admired, as also the extensive palm forests 

 about Rascon and eastward. No botanical exploration of the 

 country was made. 



September 10, 1896. — Ciudad Juarez and El Paso were reached on 

 the homeward journey. A hasty botanical survey was made of the 

 liills about El Paso, but little of interest was found in the immediate 

 vicinage of the town, because of the extreme dryness of the season. 



TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLACES VISITED. 



The Valley of Mexico, situated 7,350 feet above the level of the 

 sea, is of an elliptical form w'ith its long axis running in a north 

 and south direction. The greatest length of the valley according to 

 Orozco and Berra is from Cerro de Sincoque on the north to Cerro 

 del Teutli on the southern border of Lake Xochimilcho, a distance 

 of about 45 miles. The greatest breadth of the valley is from the 

 Hacienda de los Morales, westward a distance of 21 miles. This 

 most beautiful of basin-shaped valleys is walled in by high hills and 

 lofty mountains on all sides. Sierra del Ajusco rises in a series of 

 ridges and peaks to the south, the highest point the volcano of 

 Ajusco, long since extinct, lifting its peak 13,612 feet above sea 

 level. In the east, this ridge of mountains sinks, and forms between 

 Amecameca and Ozumba, a broad saddle, over which passes the 

 railroad from the capital to the State of Morel os. The eastern 

 mountainous rim stretches itself as a mighty wall, separating the 

 Valley of Anahuac from Pueblo. It culminates in the southeast in 

 the volcanic peak of Popocatepetl (17,782 feet), and in Iztaccihuatl 

 a long liigh broken mountain mass, 16,060 feet elevation. Contigu- 

 ous to Iztaccihuatllying to the north, we find the continuous ranges 

 called Cerro Telapon, Cerro Tlaloc, Cerro Tlamacas, Cerro Cha- 



' See an article by the writer in Bot. Gazette, May, 1898, p. 362.

pingo and the small Sierra de Patlachique — to the east as an outlier 

 in the Valley of Puel)Ia, Monte de Rio Frio. These are all of vol- 

 canic origin. About the north foot of Cerro TIamacas spread the 

 the fruitful plains of Otumba and Apam. The railroad to Vera 

 Cruz crosses here. 



The enclosure of the Valley of Mexico is completed to the west by 

 the Sierra de las Cruces, continued northward by the spurs called 

 Monte alto and Monte bajo, and ending finally in the Sierra de Tepot- 

 zatlan and Cerro de Sincoque, separated from the northern range of 

 hills by the railroad cut and drainage ditch, Tajo de Nochistongo. 

 The floor of the valley is generally level and uniform with six large 

 lakes filling the more depressed portions. Their size and elevation 

 in metres and square kilometers is given in the subjoined table : 



The relative elevation, minus or plus, has been referred to the 

 base of one of the cornersof the National Palace on the Plaza Mayor, 

 a.s the zero level. During the diluvial period of geologic time the 

 lakes were very much more extended than now. The whole Valley 

 of Mexico was filled by a large inland sea with here and there a vol- 

 canic hill rising, as an island, or a.s a peninsula, out of its surface. 

 Texcoco was in the past quite saline. Fernando Cortez in a letter to 

 Charles V, dated 1500, says: " Fnehlicho llano fdel Valle de Mex- 

 ico) hay dos lagunas, que casi lo ocupan todo. E la una de catas 

 lagunas es de aqua dulce, y la otra, que es mayor, es de aqua salada." 

 The earth of the plains surrounded Texcoco Lake is imj)r('gnnted 

 with salt, and in many places the saline material forms a rich clllo- 

 rescence. The flora of this region of the valley has a marked char- 

 acter. Various species of Cheiiopodiuvi, Atriplex, SalsoUi and (Irati- 




376 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



ola are found growing here as saline plants. The chinampas are 

 the so-called floating islands, more especially Ibiuul in Luke Xochi- 

 milcho. 



A number of small conical volcanoes rise from the floor of the 

 valley, and are known locally as Cerro de taza (cupped hill, Kup- 

 pen). One remarkable collection of these low hills is to be found 

 in the neighborhood of the town of Guadalupe, separating the Val- 

 ley of Mexico into a northern and southern portion. These, the so- 

 called Sierra de Guadalupe, are connected with the western mount- 

 ain chain Monte bajo, by the low ridge Cuesta de Barrientos, and 

 with the north-eastern ridges by the Cerro de Chiconautla. The 

 northern half of the valley thus formed is occupied by Lakes Zum- 

 pango, Xaltocan and San Cristobal, the southern half by the three 

 lakes best known to travellers, Texcoco, Chalco and Xochimilcho. 



A few words are necessary as to the geography, topography and 

 geology of the region visited botanically. Cerro de Tepeyac, one of 

 the hills of the aforementioned Sierra de Guadalupe, is 1 40 ft. high ; 

 very few plants are found on this hill. If one ascends the east side, 

 he finds for the first 115 ft- a fine crystalline rock of a dark violet- 

 gray color of a close texture frequently spotted with green, scaly, 

 porous particles. The summit of the hill is covered with a pitch- 

 stone-like rock formation about 16 to 26 ft. thick. By a rocky bridge,. 

 Cerro de Tepeyac is connected with the Cerro Gachupines. Felix 

 and Lenk' say of this hill ; " An dessen Abhang })assirt man zun- 

 achst zwei, 5 bezw. 8 ra. miichtige Pechsteinzonen, zwischen und 

 iiber welchen der rotblichgraue.kornige Andesit sich ausbreitet, der 

 die Hauptraasse des Berges ausmacht und in einigen Steinbriichen 

 zu industriellen Zwecken abgebaut wird." 



The pedregal of Tlalpam, or of San Angel is one of the most 

 interesting formations in the valley, covering an area of about 

 7,000 acres. The pedregal is an extinct lava stream situated be- 

 tween the towns of San Angel and Tlalpam, and extending south- 

 ward up the sides of the Sierra del Ajusco to the hill called Chitle. 

 It was formed when the southern mountains were in active volcanic 

 eruption. The eye of the traveller sweeps unobstructedly over an 

 arid black landscape, which might be compared to the sudden stif- 

 fening of the rolling surface of the sea. The country is extremely 

 uneven and rugged ; the coulee of lava is full of cracks, blisters, 



* 1890. Felix and Lenk, Beitrage zur Geologie und Paliiontologie der 

 Bepublik Mexico, I, 70. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 377 



caverns and sinks produced during the process of cooling. It is 

 raised into cones, presents most curious sinuosities, and is here and 

 there broken down into rugged jagged protuberances, as sharp and 

 cutting as a knife's edge. This interesting coulee is from 33 to 50 ft. 

 thick over its greatest extent, and from 20 to 26 ft. thick along its 

 borders. Felix and Lenk^ give a very interesting and true descrip- 

 tion of tl)is lava bed. " Wogenberg erhebt sich neben AVogenthal ; 

 hier ist die Lava glatt und ruit einer gliinzenden Er.starrungskru.ste 

 iiberzogen, dort ist sie, wie der Gischt der AVellp, schauniig und 

 schlackig. Deutlich kann man beobachten, wie die erstarrte Ober- 

 fliiche hiiufig geborsten ist und auf den weitreichenden Ri.ssen diinn 

 fliissigere Lavainassen eniporgequolien sind, die von den klnfTeiiden 

 Spaltenriindern niiichtige Blocke niitgeriesen und nach kurzem 

 Transport zu chaotischen Triinimerhaufen aufgestaut haben. — 

 Ausser kleinen, einst durch die Gasentwicklung in der Lavaniasse 

 entstandenen Hohlriiunien, welche .schlicsslich zur kleinheit der 

 Danipfpore herabsinken, finden sich stellenweise in ihr auch geriiu- 

 mige niehrere cubikmeter haltende Grotten, welche genetisch wohl 

 als sogenannten ' 8chlacken.«iicke ' zu betrachten sind. Durch spii- 

 teren der Einsturz Decken oder durch die bei Abkiihlungin Folge 

 der eintretenden Contraction aufgerissenen Spalten sind sie zum 

 TheilgcfifTnet und bieten zahlreichen riederniausen Wolinung, deni

 lava of the Tlalpain pedregal is a typical by perst bene free basalt. 



J'.ut that wliich concerns us mo&t are the plants, which together 

 form a very rich and renjarkal)le (Icira. Among the cau.ses which 

 favored the development of this peculiar flora may be mentioned 

 the soil temperature, which is warm and uniform, owing to the soil 

 being a basaltic scoria in the protection of which a large number 

 of herbaceous plants flourish ; the direction of the wind, the hu- 

 midity of the atmosphere of this region also favor a rich plant 

 growth. The pedregal is surrounded by high hills, {)rotected thus 

 from the tempe.«tuf)U8 winds of the north. Woods of pine, oak and 

 fir clotiie the hillsides and serve as an additional j)rotcction. In this 

 region are found deep cafiadas, always damp and wet from abund- 

 ant water, which comes from numerous showers and the spray of 

 waterfalls which precipitate themselves from various heights. Asa 

 result of these factors, the climate of the pedregal is more temper-

ate and more constant than that of the City of Mexico, or of the 

 Hacienda de Eslava, where a nieteoroh)gical station has been estab- 

 lished. In consequence of the meteorological conditions, the ped- 

 regal supports a Hora made up of many representatives of the tierra 

 fria, tierra templada and tierra calieute. 



The Serrania de las Cruces is a continuation northwestward of 

 the Sierra del Ajusco. It is an elevated region, and by reason of 

 that elevation and exposure to the winds of the north and west pre- 

 sents a very distinct flora. One part of the region, that on the west 

 flanks of the Serrania del Ajusco, is very humid ; the central por- 

 tion is more dry. Large forests of fir, Abies religiosa, once covered 

 the western side, but these are fast disappearing before the axe of 

 Mexican wood choppers. The higher elevations present a charac- 

 teristic alpine flora. Many of the places with an eastern exposure 

 are quite sterile, as to the abundance of plants found in such locali- 

 ties.

lOlb. Senecio praeooz DC, Prodr., VI, 431. 



Senecio praecox is a composite plant inhabiting the volcanic beds 

 in the Valley of Mexico. It has a cylindrical stem rising three or 

 four feet from the ground with clustered, deeply lobed leaves at the 

 top. The plant stores up an abundant supply of water in the pith, 

 which is gradually used up during the dry season in Mexico, which 

 lasts from October to June. The flowers develop in April at the 

 expense of the reserved supply of water. Loss of water during the 

 dry season is jjrevented by the fall of the leaves, and by the protec- 

 tive cork and balsam secreted in the exo- and endocortex. The 

 water stored in the turgid discs of pith is gradually conducted by 

 the woody cells and tracheids, which penetrate into the medulla by 

 wedge shaped ingrowths, representing the primary bundles, to the 

 growing point where it is used. That this is the case, is shown by 

 the dry parchment-like pith membranes, which were left in a piece 

 of a stem which had remained in the dry state for over sixteen 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



months. Conduction of water in this stem was accomplished with- 

 out the aid of root pressure, without any appreciable influence on 

 the part of the small green leaves in drawing up the liquid by the 

 pumping action of transpiration.*

the same rugged characters as elsewhere. Along its edge, here, 



runs the small stream known as Rio Cherubusco. The region 



shows the same profusion of flowering plants as elsewhere in the

 white through the gradual fading out of the purple color. One 

 most commonly sees in a state of nature the white heads, wliich are 

 tinted with lavender or pale purple at the base of the ray floret. 

 The heads in each case are nearly uniform in size, being about an 

 inch and three-fourths across. (See an article of mine, " The Na-

 yellow through the following gradations: lavender-purple, helio- 

 trope, heliotrope-yellow (various shades of lighter and lighter hue 

 approaching yellow), sulphur-yellow. The heads in which the ray 

 florets are colored heliotrope-yellow, are in reality of an heliotrope 

 color, the bases of the ligulate corolla being of a yellow color, shad-

I. La Cima. Summit of Sierra del Ajusco. 



La Cima is an Indian town 38 miles from the city of Mexico 

 on the crest or summit of the Sierra del Ajusco at about 11,000 

 feet above sea level. It is, therefore, about 2,000 feet lower than 

 the Cerro Grande del Ajusco, or volcanic cone (13,612 feet). It 

 was from this extinct crater, that the great pedregal of Tlalpam 

 and many of the smaller jiedregals were formed by lava flows in 

 prehistoric times. The pedregal of La Cima is lower than the town, 

 which consists of a few adobe huts. It presents the same rugged 

 features, as those of the great lava l)ed between San Angel and Tlal- 

 pam, which has been already fully described. Most of the plants 

 mentioned in the accompanying list are from the hill overlooking 

 and directly above the town on the east side of the railroad. The

J. Salazar and Sierra de las Cmcr^. 



A brief description of this region is given in the introductory geo- 

 graphical portion. The region is one of great exposure to trying 

 and cold winds, we, therefore, find a more truoly alpine flora than 

 at La Cima, although the elevations are about the same. Tliis 

 accounts for the presence at Salazar of low, cespitose, or dwarfed 

 species. 



A ditch along the railroad before reaching Salazar afforded many 

 interesting j)lants. Las Cruces Valley, the scene of the battle in 

 1810 between Hidalgo and the Spaniards resulting in a victory for 

 the patriots, yielded a great variety of plants. The level of the 

 mountain meadows composing the valley is about 10,000 feet altitude. 

 Many cold springs, render the district fine botanizing ground.

Orizaba and Cordoba. 



Orizaba (4,000 feet) and Cordoba (2,700 feet) on the line of the 

 Mexican Railroad (Ferro-Carril Mexicano) can be treated of 

 together. Orizaba is a town of 15,000 inhabitants, 82 miles from 

 Vera Cruz and 181 miles from the City of Mexico. The town lies 

 in a little valley surrounded by very fine mountains. The peak of 

 Orizaba, however, cannot be seen, save a tiny strip of glittering 

 white over the crest of the Cerro de la Escamela. The other sur- 

 rounding hills are : the Barrego ; the Ranchito de Cri.sto ; Jala- 

 pilla ; San Juan del Rio ; the Rincon Grande ; and La Perla. The 

 town is composed, for the most part, of low houses with red-tiled 

 roofs; it is crossed by two small streams, and by the little river 

 Orizaba (through a rocky ravine filled with tropical plants), all of 

 which unite near by in the River Blanco, which plunges over a pre- 

 cipice in a cascade in the Rincon Grande. The valley alone was 

 explored botanically during the short time at the disposal of the 

 writer. The several ravines were followed through the town to the 

 outskirts, when circling the town, the fields and copses and woods 

 were investigated for the plants that might be in flower. Most of 

 the larger trees were found to be loaded down with epiphytes, 

 orchids, tilland.sias, and mistletoe with several ferns. To one who 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF rHILADELPIIIA. 409 



for the first time visits a tropical country, the very wealth of the 

 material completely nonplusses him for a time. The region abounds 

 in orchids. Only the smaller forms were collected although many fine 

 large ones were seen. A botanii^t is at once impressed with, the 

 luxuriance of the epiphytic growths. A hasty visit was also paid 

 to the Rincon Grande, where a number of plants were collected 

 within the influence of the spray of the water-fall. 



Only two hours were spent at Cordobn, between trains, so that 

 only a most hasty and superficial collection of plants was made of 

 the flora of this most interesting tropical region.

 is easy from suckers, cuttings or seeds. This big shrub is easilv held

FOSSIL MOLLUSKS AND DIATOMS FROM THE DISMAL SWAMP, 



VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA; INDICATION OF 



THE GEOLOGICAL AGE OF THE DEPOSIT. 



BY LEWIS WOOLMAN. 



WITH NOTES ON THE DIATOMS. 

 BY CHARLES 8. BOYER. 



During the winter of 1897-98 the Dismal Swamp Canal was 

 widened and deepened, and the level of the central portion lowered so 

 as to dispense with the middle two of the four locks heretofore in use. 

 The work was done liy the McIManus Construction Company of 

 Philadelphia, steam rotary dredging machines being used in exca- 

 vating. These dredges brought up from the bottom, at points both 

 south and north of the Virginia-North Carolina boundary, large 

 numbers of marine moUusks. Through the appreciative interest in 

 scientific matters of M, Homer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Con- 

 struction Company, we have been furnished on three occasions with 

 specimens of these shells, which he specially and personally col- 

 lected on his visits to the field of operations. 



It is the purpose of this paper to put on record the species of 

 these shells and also of the marine diatoms which were associated 

 with them in the same matrix, and to indicate, though perhaps ten- 

 tatively, from a study of both the macroscopic and microscopic fos- 

 sils, the geological age of the bed from which they were obtained. 



The Dismal Swamp Canal connects on the south at a point near 

 South stills, N. C, with the headwaters of the Pasquotank River, a 

 tributary of Albemarle Sound, and on the north at a j)oint near 

 Deep Creek with the waters of the south branch of the Elizabeth 

 River, a tributary of the James River and the Chesapeake Bay. 

 The general direction of the canal between these two points is north- 

 ward, with, however, a decidedly obtuse angled bend, or bow, to the 

 westward, the angle being near Drummond Lake, from which a 

 feeder canal brings the water from the lake into the main canal. 

 This feeder was also deepened. 



M. Homer states that the shells furnished by him were obtained 

 from the following localities : — 




1898.] XATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 415 



1st. — A point on the main canal in North Carolina, two to three 

 miles south of the Virginia boundary. 



2d. — A point on the main canal in Virginia, about five miles 

 north of the feeder, or four miles north of Wallaceton, a small Post 

 Office and settlement on drained land near the centre of the swamp. 



3d. — A point about midway of the feeder, say one and one-half 

 miles west of its junction with the main canal. 



A noticeable peculiarity, as stated by ^I. Homer, is that the 

 collections from the main canal, from both the Virginia and North 

 Carolina localities, contain great numbersof the large conch, Fulgur 

 carica, while this shell is wanting in those thrown out from the 

 feeder. Here, however, the oysters, Ostrea virginica, are exceed- 

 ingly numerous, and many of them are of extra large size, one speci- 

 men in the possession of M. Homer measuring ten inches in length 

 and four and one-half inches in width. 



But few specimens, comprising only three species, were brought 

 from the locality south of the Virginia-North Carolina line. M. 

 Homer, however, states that the shells seemed as varied in form and 

 as plentiful there as north of Wallaceton. 



In one lump of clay matrix, about the size of a walnut, obtained 

 from the bottom of the dredgings north of Wallaceton, we discov- 

 ered, on a [treliminary microscopic examination, a very few diatoms, 

 and a few, thougli jjeriiap-- aslightly larger number of sj)onge spicu- 

 les. A .separation and cleaning of the diatoms from this lump of 

 clay was made by a fellow member of the Academy, John A. 

 Shuize, after which the forms were identified by another member, 

 Prof C. iS. Boyer. The mollusks were jointly identified by Prof H. 

 A. Pilibry of the Conclujlogical Section of the Academy and C. W. 

 Johnston, Curator of the \N'agner Free Institute of Science. 



Ik-low we tabulate the mollusks according to their range in geo- 

 logical time into three columns headed Miocene (M), Pliocene (P) 

 and Recent (R; — under Recent are incluiled both Plei.«tocene and 

 now living forms. On the rigiit, in two additional columns, we note 

 the occurrence of such of the forms us have been found in the Croa- 

 tan, N. C, and the Waccamaw. S. C, beds, both of which contain 

 a somewhat similar mollusoan fauna. 



The geological range, as noted in the first three c<»lum?i8, we take 

 from Dr. W. H. Dall's " Tal)le8 of Species" from the Waccamaw 

 and the Croatan beds.' * 



'Transactions of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Vol. Ill, I'art 2, 

 pages -lU to 215 




410 PROCEEDINGS OK THE ACADEMY OP [1898. 



The Croatan beds are in North Carolina, about 120 niilesslightly 

 west of south of the Dismal Swamp, and about eighteen miles from 

 the nearest jioint on the coast. They are on the northern border 

 of a similar swamp area on the southern side of the Neuse River, 

 and are aliout fifteen miles below Newbern. Both the Croatan 

 iiud the Dismal Swamp shell localities are api)roximately 75 or 80 

 miles eastward of the rocks of the Piedmont plateau, which rocks 

 bound the inland border of the less consolidated beds of the Atlan- 

 tic Coastal i)lain. The two localities occupy a similar position both 

 geographically and stratigraphically. 



The Waccamaw beds are in the extreme eastern part of the State 

 of South Carolina, and are exposed along the banks of the Wacca- 

 maw River from some four miles, to about 18 miles above Conway. 

 They are on low ground, and are also on the western side of another 

 of the swamp areas that occur on the seaward margin of the coastal 

 plain from Cape May County, N. J., to South Carolina and Georgia. 

 Geographically, they are similarly situated to the Croatan and the 

 Dismal Swamp localities. 



Fossil mollusks from the Croatan and the Waccamaw localities 

 have been carefully studied and listed by Dr. W. H. Dall, who refers 

 both beds to the Pliocene. The fauna, however, when considered 

 with reference to the percentage of recent over extinct forms, would 

 indicate that the Croatan beds were slightly the younger of the two 

 deposits, there being, according to Dr. Dall, 83 per cent, of recent 

 forms in the Croatan and only 70 per cent, in the Waccamaw beds. 

 In summing up. Dr. Dall says " the Croatan beds are obviously 

 newer than those of the Waccamaw, yet when compared with the 

 atlmitted Pleistocene beds of South Carolina such as those of Sim- 

 mons Bluff, the presence on the Neuse " [the locality of the Croatan 

 beds] "of 41 out of 90 species, which have not been known later 

 than the Pliocene, forbids us to regard the fauna as later than Plio- 

 cene." 



In the stufly of tlie mollusks from the Dismal Swamp Canal the 

 writer has had the advantage of some correspondence with Dr. W. 

 H. Dall and of consultation with Prof H. A. Pilsbry and C. W. 

 Johnson, the latter of whom has collected a full series of shells from 

 tlie Croatan beds, and a like series from tlie Waccamaw beds, Ijoth 

 of which collections are now displayed in the Museum of the 

 Wagner Free Institute of Science of Philadelphia, and with which 

 tlie shells from the Dismal Swamp have been carefully compared. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 417 



The tliree species previously noted as having been collected from 

 the bottom of the old south level near South ^lills, N. C, were Uro- 

 salpinx cliterea, Fidgur carica and Oftrea virginica — the elevation 

 of the surface at this point being about 11 feet. 



All the forms, however, listed below, excepting IJrosalpinx cin- 

 erea Say, were obtained from a locality along the Deep Creek level 

 of the Old Canal, at a point four miles north of Wallaceton, Va., 

 and from a depth of about ten feet, the elevation of the surface being 

 about sixteen feet. The Deep Creek level is next north of the sum- 

 mit level of the old canal, the latter having an elevation of about 

 twenty feet. 



Ostrea virrjinica, generally much larger and more numerous than 

 at South Mills or at north of Wallaceton, was likewise brought up 

 in the dredgings from the bottom of the feeder leading from Drum- 

 niond Lake, say at approximately ten feet below the surface level, 

 which, at the point under consideration, is about twenty feet above 

 tide, the elevation of the surface of the lake being, according to a 

 survey raaile by the U.S. Engineers during tlie winter of 18i>5-1890,

 der of the swamp near Suffolk, Va., and near the Jericho Canal, 

 which leads n(jrth-westwardly from Lake Drummond to the Nanse- 

 mond River, have been noted by Prof. N. S. hhaler. After listing 

 the species as identitied by Dr. W. H. Dall, he says: " Traces of 

 this same deposit occur a few miles south of Suflblk, and I suspect 

 the existence of similar bdls near Elizabeth City. From certain 

 comminuted fragments taken from the bottom of the main Dismal 

 S\vam[) Canal, it seems to me not improbal)le that the l»ods were 

 toiiclied in making that excavation. I am, therefore, disposed to 

 believe that the foundation rocks beneath the swamp district consist 

 mainly of the l)t'ds indicated by the foregoing list of fossils.'" 



I'njf. Shalcr thus indicates fossil beds which the recent deepening 

 of the Dismal Swamp Canal has abundantly verified, thougii very few 

 of the species in Prof Shaler's collcctifm and our own arc the same; 

 and yet, as will be seen further on, ui>on analyzing the forms in the 

 two collections, they tell a similar geological tale. 



We now in.«ert tables of the mollusks from the Dismal Swamp 

 and the Jericho Canal localities.

rROCEEDIN(;S OF THE ACADEMY OE 



[inns. 



Ill the lists above there are but 3 species occurring injboth locali- 

 ties, viz. : Cytherea convexa, Liicina cremilata, and Ostrea virginica. 

 Adding tiie numbers in the two lists and deducting tliese three, 

 siuce they have been counted twice, we find there are, altogether, 52 

 molluscan forms, of which 3 are not specifically identified. Analyz- 

 ing the remaining 49, we find their numbers range in geological 

 time as follows : — 



from which it will be seen that there are 



Pliocene and pre-Pliocene forms 7 species. 



Ranging from Miocene to Recent 16 species. 



Both Pliocene and Recent 14 species. 



Recent, including Pleistocene 12 species. 



Judging from these proportionate figures alone, which show 42 

 forms still living, out of a total of 49, the writer would be inclined 

 to assign the age of the beds from which these fossils were obtained 

 as not earlier than late Pliocene time, while it may even possibly 

 belong to Pleistocene time. 



We may, however, more particularly note other reasons for this 

 conclusion as to age. 



Twenty-six, or fully one-half of the shells specifically identified, 

 clearly have a post-Miocene aspect, including two forms, Fulgur 

 cnrica and Ostrea virginica, which are the most numerous of the col- 

 lection. The specimens of i''. carica present a peculiarity of sculpt- 

 ure which distinguishes them from the shells now living upon the 

 coast; the surface i)eing densely scored by fine crimped or undulat- 

 ing spiral striae, in fully adult, large individuals. In recent shells 

 of similar size such striation is nearly obsolete or wholly wanting, 

 even when the superficial coat has not been removed by erosion. 




1898.] , NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 4'21 



Sixteen otlier forms have a persistent range from the Miocene 

 through the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods down to the present 

 time. 



If we include these 16 as representatives of recent time, we have, 

 as noted above, 42 ; or. as pointed out by Dr. Dall in a letter from 

 which we quote, " nearly all the species as recent." 



One other form, Area limula, is usually considered distinctively 

 Miocene, hut its jiresence may be accounted for by considering it as 

 an intnjtluction from the underlying Miocene beds, which are prob- 

 ably not over 50 feet from the surface in this region. Bearing upon 

 this, the writer may say that he has in his possession artesian well 

 l)oring.s recently made at Old Point Comfort and Norfolk, Va. At 

 Old Point Comfort, at the depth of 50 feet, were a number of shells, 

 among them such Miocene forms as Doainia acdabulum and Pecitn 

 madisonius, while at Norfolk there were obtained, at the depth of 

 105 foet, a fragment of Pecten madisonhis, at 1 1 5 feet a perfect shell of 

 Giiathodon clathrodon,a.nd at 175 feet a fragment o( Pecten eboreus. 



Respecting another form in the Dismal Swamp bed, Area ■plica- 

 turn, or perhaps a variety thereof, Dr. Dall says, after an examina- 

 tion by him of a number of specimens of this species which we had 

 sent liim : "The Area you send is one which occurs in the Duplin 

 County Natural Well, North Carolina, and which was named by 

 Conrad Area lineolata ; but as there was already a species of this 

 name, D'Orbigny re-named it sublineolata. It ai)pears to be a mu- 

 tation of .1. plirntura, to which I have referred it in my (MS.) work 

 on the Tertiary Areas of the United States. There was one Plio- 

 cene species in the fossils from the Jericho Canal,^ and as the Du- 

 plin I)e<l3 are at the very top of the Miocene, it would not be strange 

 \i' A. Hnblineolata overlajiped." 



Bearing .-lill further upon the entire sidyect, we further (piote Dr. 

 Dall from the same letter : — 



"The species from your list* are all recent except ylrca /mm/a 

 [and Arrn /niblin'olufn'j, but some of them are not now foun<l so far 

 north. Now we know that in Pliocene times some northwurd ad- 

 vance was made by the warm water species, such as Gnathodon and 

 C'lirenn. There are too many recent species (assuming that the fauna 

 is not a mechanical mixture of sheila of different ages) for the refer- 



•This ha.*; reference to the bed near Suffolk, the forms from which apj)ear

'Keference is here made onlj to the tirbt list, that from near Wallaceton. 




422 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



enceof this fauna to the Upper Miocene — and we know that the ex- 

 tinct species [.4. limula and ,1. Uneokda] are not quaternary even in 

 Floritia — so, subject to the above assumption, I think we shall have 

 to regard it as Pliocene. * * * * The Croatan beds are dis- 

 tinctively Pliocene, but these are more like the contact between the 

 southern Pliocene and a more northern cold water fauna." 



Corroborative of the views already advanced as to the age of this 

 bed is the following, written by Prof. N. S. Shaler respecting the 

 mollusks listed above from near the Jericho Canal : " The species 

 determined by W. H. Dall, paleontologist of the U. S, Geological 

 Survey, indicates in a general manner that the beds are of Pliocene 

 age. Of the 29 species that appear in my collection, 24, according 

 to Dr. Dall, belong to living forms and 5 are extinct. The extinct 

 species are found in the so-called Pliocene of Florida, South Car- 

 olina and Virginia. There can be no question the deposit is of |)re- 

 glacial age."^ 



We now consider the evidence presented by the diatom flora 

 which we think corroborates that presented by the mollusks for rea- 

 sons which we shall note after the introduction of the following state- 

 ment by Charles S. Boyer, A. M., made by him after a careful ex- 

 amination of a number of mounts prepared from the material which 

 had been reliably cleaned, as already stated, by John A. Shulze, and 

 to which we are well assured there has been no admixture of di- 

 atoms fiom any other source: — 



"The following list includes all the forms, 31 in number, found 

 in the slides of the Dismal Swamp material except a few fragments 

 which were too small for accurate determination. 



"In the middle column is noted the relative frequency and rarity 

 of some of the forms in comparison with the rest as seen in the 

 strewn mounts : — 



" Of the above forms all but four are strictly marine. The ex- 

 ceptions are Navicula major and Stauroneis Phoenicenteron, which 

 are fresh water, Camprjlodiscus Kcheneis which is both brackish and 

 fresh water, and Melosira crenidata var. anliqua, which is possibly 

 also fresh water. 



" I think I have named all on the slides at hand, except probably 

 one or two forms of Coscinodiscus and Navicula, which were in frag- 

 ments.

and Stauroncls Pkoenicenteron can he considered as distinctive of 

 later deposits. 



" In general, therefore, it may he said that the deposit can he con- 

 sidered as a mixture of Miocene and hiter deposits, though the lat- 

 ter need not necessarily have been so venj recent." 



From an examination of the above list of diatoms the present 

 author would classify thera as follows : Six forms characteristically 

 Miocene, 19 forms that have survived from Miocene to present time 

 and are now livinsr, and 4 either Pliocene or Pleistocene, or both, 

 and also now living. These 4 are the same as those noted above by 

 C. S. Boyer as distinctive of deposits later than Miocene. 



If the 19 survivals belong to present time, there are 23 that may 

 be considered recent, or comparatively so. Respecting the ex- 

 clusively Miocene forms it is i)robable that these have been brought 

 down in post-Miocene times by the James River in its passage over 

 the original beds from Richmond southeastward. It is probable 

 also that some of the individuals of perhaps each of the 19 species 

 having the more cosmopolitan range were also similarly introduced. 

 We are confirmed in this view by the occurrence among the char- 

 acteristic Miocene dx^itom^ 0^ Actinoptyclius Heliopelta, a form which 

 the writer has frequently found heretofore both in outcrops and in 

 well borings, but always at or below the base of the great 800 to 

 400 feet Miocene diatomaceous clay bed of the Atlantic Coastal 

 Plain. In Maryland it occurs at the base of this bed in well bor- 

 ings at Crisfield and in outcrops at and near Nottingham on the 

 Patuxent River. In Virginia it has been found in outcrops at 

 Petersburg'and Bermuda Hundred, In New Jersey, owing proba- 

 bly to a thickening of the basal beds of the Miocene, it occurs some 

 distance below tiie main diatom bed. It has thus been found in out- 

 crops near, Shiloh and in well borings at Asbury Park and Wild- 

 wood. At the latter place it was found in a thin seam of clay about 

 250 feet below the bottom of the great diatom bed. In each instance 

 just cited its position is at or very near the base of the Miocene, 

 either resting directly upon or only a short distance above green- 

 sands of Eocene Age. Many other borings have been made in New 

 Jersey through or nearly through these beds, from which the writer 

 has had complete series of speciniens every 10 to 20 feet apart, all 

 of which he has examined, but in none of them has he ever found A. 

 Heliopelta stratigraphically higher than near the base of the Mio- 

 cene. Now the diatom bed outcropping at Richmond, Petersburg 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPniA. 425 



and vicinity has been found by the writer in the Norfolk well bor- 

 ing at between the depths of 585 and 625 feet, while the continuation 

 upward of the same clay contained sponge spicules up to about 400 

 feet from the surface. No diatoms or .sponge spicules were found 

 higher in this well excepting between the depths of 25 feet and G5 

 feet, where a stratum, probably the eqiiivuleiit of the Dismal Swam|) 

 bed, contained these .same micro-organisms, though, as in the Dis- 

 mal Swamp deposit, very sparingly. The Miocene beds at Bermuda 

 Hundred and Petersburg are rich in diatom.*, and e.-jpecially so in 

 A. Heliopelta, and since the diatoms in the Dismal Swamp dej)Osit 

 were exceedingly meager, (perhaps not one per cent, of the entire 

 matrix), and since A. Heliopelta and other Miocene species were 

 scantiest in nural)er.s of all the contained forms, we cannot, in view of 

 all the facts, consider that the introduction of these Miocene forms has 

 been by other than mechanical means in post-Miocene times. At what 

 period that subsequent time was, three of the more recent forms, 

 Campi/lodiseus Echoieii, Ceratnulns furr/idii-^ nnd Stauronei-f Phoeni- 

 crnienm, shed much light. We will now particularly notice each of 

 these forms. 



In a mass of brick clay from a low terrace at Bridgeton, N. J., 

 which terrace is assigned by the New Jer.sey State Geological 

 Survey report to a very recent geological phase of the gravels of 

 that State, the writer found a very considerable numl)er of diatoms 

 not at all Miocene in aspect, and among them a large number of 

 the same species of Cerataulus. 



Re.si)ecting Campy lodiscus Erhencis it may be Mtated that this form 

 has been recorded as living principally in brackish waler.«tlie world 

 over, though Prof. (.'. S. Boyer informs the writer that lie has found 

 it in a fresh water reservoir at I'liiladelphia, sujjplied from the 

 Schuylkill River. Though not, however, heretofore recorded, so far 

 as we an; able to learn, as fossil, yet the writer has so .seen it in a 

 low level clay from near Huckshutem on the .Maurice River, behtw 

 Millville, N. J., the stratigraphical po.-ition of which i- the rrpiiva- 

 lent of the Bridgeton clay above referred to. 



On a nuip (jf the surface formations of New Jersey in the annual 

 report of the geological survey of that State for 1897 there is .slu)wn 

 a low level formation on the shores of Raritan Bay and thence border- 

 ing the Atlantic Ocean from San<ly Hook to the Cape May peninsula, 

 which it either entirely covers or nearly so, and thence extending 

 up the Delaware Itiver nearly to Trenton. This low lying terrace,

which is stated iu the text to have an elevation of 30 to 50 feet, ex- 

 tends inland along the courses of the following streams : some 20 

 miles up the MuUica and the Great Egg Harbor Rivers, about 25 

 miles up the Maurice River, and some 10 miles up the Cohansey 

 River. These measurements were made iu a direct line from the 

 mouths of the rivers and not by following the winding courses thereof. 

 The surface deposit of this terrace has been named by Prof. R. D. 

 Salisbury the Cape May Formation. He describes it as a 'thin 

 body of loam, sand and gravel of lesser age than any " of the surface 

 formations of the State described in the same paper "except pos- 

 sibly the drift of the last glacial epoch." He further says : "The 

 strict contemporaneity of this formation with the drift of the last 

 glacial epoch is not established, but it is probably at least partly 

 contemporaneous with it, though its later portions may be still 

 younger."^ To this formation belong the diatom clays noted in the 

 preceding paragraphs as at Bridgeton and Buckshutem. 



Stauroneis Phoenicenteron has never been seen by the writer in 

 any of the numerous specimens of Miocene diatomaceous clays which 

 he has examined during the past ten years, nor has it, so far as he 

 has been able to learn from consultation of the literature relating 

 to it, been recorded by others as occurring in beds of that age. It 

 has, however, a world wide distribution in freshwater deposits of 

 decidedly later age. Ehrenberg, in the Atlas of his Mikrogeologie, 

 notes it in various sands and black, white and gray earths at numer- 

 ous localities (named below) most of which the writer would char- 

 acterize from their position stratigraphically and geographically as 

 decidedly post-miocene and some of them as clearly glacial and 

 post-glacial. Thus Ehrenberg lists this diatom on page 19 of his 

 Atlas as occurring in various earths and at different places, 

 as follows: — in lake mud from Loka, Sweden; in Bergmehl from 

 Degenfors and Lillhaggsjohn, Sweden, also from Santa Fiora, Italy, 

 and from the south point of Tierra del Fuego, S. A.; in Bliitterkohl 

 from Westerwalde, Prussia; in white earth from Guatemala; in Kiesel- 

 guhr from Andover, Pelham and Wrentham, Massachusetts; from 

 Ceyssatt, France ; from Down, Mourue Mountains, Ireland; from 

 New Hampshire and from Earlton, Nova Scotia; in white marl 

 (Mergee) ; from Farmington, Conn.; in Meteorj)apier, from Rauden, 

 Prussia; in tripoli and polishing powder, from Moscow, Russia; 

 and in Weisenpapier, from Freiberg, Saxony.

1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 427 



It lias also been found fossil by Prof. C. S. Boyer, in specimens of 

 clavs obtained by the writer from the upper portions of two well 

 borings, one on the beach at "Wildwood/ Cape ^lay Co., N. J., and 

 the other at Rock Hail," Md., on the eastern side of Chesapeake 

 Bay opposite the mouth of the Patapsco river. The clays referred to 

 occupied, at Wildwood, the interval between the depths of 79 and 

 181 feet, and at Rock Hall a similar interval between the depths of 

 50 and 130 feet. The clays at both localities contained a mixture 

 of fresh-water and marine diatoms, the numbers of individuals of the 

 fresh-water fjrms somewhat exceeding those of the marine. That 

 these two deposits are probably synchronous in age appears probable 

 from the similarity of their position next below the surface forma- 

 tion (Cape May formation?), also from the similarity of the as- 

 sembled forms of diatoms, and from the occurrence in both of a 

 unique diatom, Polymyxus coronalis, L. W. Bailey, not however, found 

 in our examination of the forms in the Dismal Swanip bed. This 

 form has not been heretofore known except as living off the mouths 

 of the Para and Amazon Rivers in South America. That the two 

 deposits are much later than Miocene in age may be inferred from 

 the fact that the one at Rock Hall lies directly upon the Rancocas 

 division of the Cretaceous, the Miocene itself resting at a higher 

 level upon Eocene beds a few miles southward and eastward ; while 

 at Wildwoo<l the top of the great Miocene diatom clay bed occurs 

 nearly 200 feet deeper than the base of the deposit under considera- 

 tion, or at the depth of 370 feet from the surface. The well borings, 

 however, show that ap[)arently the same Miocene clay, but without 

 diatoms, commences at the depth of 294 feet. 



These two deposits containing I'oluimjxus coro)iiilij< and Stanronei$ 

 Phoenicenteron, the writer suggests were probably laid down in the 

 deltas of the ancient Delaware and Chesapeake Rivers at the time 

 when the shore line of the Atlantic Coastal plain was many miles 

 eastward of its present position and much of tho now submerged 

 portion of the plain was above sea level. 



SUMMAI'.V. 



After considering the position of the Dismal Swamp bod, bcnoafh 

 a low lying terrace on the eastern margin of the Coastal Plain and 

 evidently resting immediately U[)on fossiliferous Miocene beds which

cau be traced westward along the James River some eighty miles 

 or more to Richmond, Va., and after a careful study and analysis of 

 the contained moUusksand diatoms the conclusion before stated has 

 been reached that both the macroscopic and the microscopic fossils 

 indicate a meclianical mixture of the Miocene and a comparatively 

 recent fi\una and flora^ the Miocene forms having been contributed 

 and brought down by erosion from the broad and somewhat higher 

 and gradually rising Miocene belt to the westward, while the more 

 recent forms lived and were deposited as the bed was laid down in 

 a more recent geological time. 



If we accept the conclusions of all the authorities we have quoted 

 who have studied the Dismal Swamp deposit, we should have to re- 

 fer this bed unequivocally to the Pliocene period. The writer, how- 

 ever, cannot resist inferring from the scantiness of INIiocene fossils, 

 which, as already noted, he views as mechanically introduced — 

 from the wide range of many of the Pliocene mollusks, extending 

 down to the present time — from the very decidedly recent aspect of 

 many other shells — and from the even more decidedly recent aspect 

 of some of the diatoms, a more recent date for the bed, and therefore 

 considers that it cannot belong to a period earlier than the latest 

 Pliocene, and that it may, indeed, even belong quite within Pleisto- 

 cene time. 



Specimens of all the mollusks listed from the Dismal Swamp 

 Canal have been presented to the Academy of Natural Sciences by 

 M. Homer, and are now arranged in its paleontological collection, 

 while strewn mounts of the diatoms have been deposited in the cab- 

 inet of the Biological and Microscopical Section by the author.

HYALODENDRON NA VALIUM. A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF 

 EUPLECTELLID SPONGE. 



BY J. PERCY MOORE. 



The type of this genus and species is one of a small collection of 

 silicious sponges gathered in Japan in 1893 by Mr. Frederick 

 Stearns, of Detroit, Michigan, and sent to the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia for determination. They were collected by 

 native fishermen and brought into Yokohama harbor by the dredge 

 boats. The single specimen of Hyalodendron is the only one which 

 had been reported by the fi.shermen. Other than this, no data relat- 

 ing to the collection are available. The specimens are accompanied 

 by a set of sketches by a native artist. 



The species represented are, in addition to Hyalodendron, Euplec- 

 tella, anchor spicules of probably E. aspergillwn Owen, Hyalonema 

 reflexa Ijima, a fine specimen of this recently described species and 

 Farrea occa (Bowerbank) Carter, an unusually large example. 



HYALODENDRON nov. gen. 

 Hyalodendron navalinm n. s. 



The general appearance of the type and only specimen is well 

 shown on Plate XIX, reproduced from a sketch by a Japanese artist 

 which accompanied the collection. The sponge was originally 

 about 18 inches high, but is now slightly mutilated at the summit. 

 It presents a firm base, above which rises a slender tapering body or 

 stalk, ending in a sharp apex, and bearing numerous lateral branches 

 of various sizes, at the bases of which the sponge wall is perforated 

 by large crater-like openings. 



The base is a thin, flat and spreading, encrusting layer, which has 

 evidently conformed itself to the j-ocky bottom to which the sponge 

 was adherent, some fragments of which are still attached. Its 

 upper surface is uneven, but smooth and without any spines or j)ro- 

 cesses. It is perforated by three or four small holes. It measures 

 3ix3| inches in diameter, and is from A to i inch thick. The 

 spicules of this region are mostly slender, more or less curved^ 

 pointed diacts of various sizes, rao.st of them being almost fibre-like. 

 They cross one another at various angles and are firmly united into 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 431 



a hard stony mass by a secondary deposit of silica wliich encrusts 

 and cements them, with the formation of numerous synaptacula 

 (Plate XX, fig. 6). Regular or modified hexacts are occasionally 

 found wedged in interstices, but the appearance is that the demalia 

 and hypoderraalia have been worn or decayed away from tliis region. 



The sponge body or stalk rises from near the centre of the base 

 to a height of 16 inches. Its summit is frayed out and must have 

 been originally at least an inch higher. It is terete and tapers gently 

 and regularly from the base, which is !J of an inch in diameter, to 

 the broken apex, 2 of an inch in diameter. A well develojied 

 gastral cavity extends through the sponge body from base to sum- 

 mit, so that it is hollow throughout. Toward the base the walls 

 are thick and firm, owing to secondary incru.-^tations of silica, while 

 above they are much thinner and quite friable. 



The lower 31 inches of the body have a texture and appearance 

 similar to the base, but the transition to the branched upper region 

 is gradual. A very few short blunt spines are borne on the sponge 

 wall, and these partake of the stony hardness and silicious incrus- 

 tations which characterize the walls of this region. Two longer 

 spines, having n)ore of the character of the upper branches, are 

 jtresent, the first 1 inch, and the second 2i inches above the base. 

 These 'are respectively I and \ of an inch long. The former is 

 situated just above the first crater-like opening in the sponge walls. 

 This region of the sponge has a smooth hard surface, and like the 

 basal portion lacks the su{)erficial layers of spicules. 



At about 3* inches above the base, loose flesh spicules become 

 more plentiful and soon form a thick soft layer, looking very much 

 like a covering of a fine cotton wool paste, or as if the specimen had 

 been dipped into a thick soap lather, which had been allowed to dry 

 on its surface. Coincident with this change in the character of the 

 surface, s[)inous processes become more numerou-* and very much 

 longer, but in this specimen the lower spines are imperfect. While 

 in tlic lower portion (h) of the sponge the processes renniin compar- 

 atively simple and unbranched, those which densely cover the upper 

 half of the stalk are often very long (the longest nearly /J inches 

 and i'« of an inch in diameter at the bas^/), much and comple.\ly 

 branched, .sometimes to the third onler. Wherever such branches 

 cross they are united by secondary ana.-tomoseH, due to the C(»ncre- 

 sence of the parenchyma. The j)rincipal branches vary in diameter t 

 from A to r'e of an inch, but two mav fuse at their bases and form 




432 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



a much larger mass. The smaller may be unbninched and reach 

 a lengtli of two inches, but are usually provided with a few small 

 brunches. The larger are complexly branched, the secondary 

 brandies usually forming angles of about 60° with the principal 

 branches, which latter arise from the central trunk at angles of 80°- 

 90°. 



While the base and lower part of the stalk are perforated by 

 only a few small pores, the upper part has numerous consj)icuou8 

 oscula. They perforate the sponge wall between the larger bundles 

 of fil)rous spicules, the outer flesh layers rising I of an inch as 7 

 delicate crater-like rims, scarcely thicker than a sheet of paper. 

 The oscula are usually elongated in the longitudinal direction of the 

 sponge, and in that case have a length of 5 to 6 mm., by a width of 

 2 to 3 millimeters. In such the rim flares out somewhat at the 

 sides and contracts at the ends, so that its outer edge has a nearly 

 circular outline. Some few of the oscula are circular at their 

 gastral ends. With regard to their distril)ution on the s[)onge 

 walls, the lower-most is situated 2^ inches above the base, and its 

 rim is thickened like the neighboring sponge walls. ]\Iost of them 

 evidently stand in some relation to the larger branches. Three 

 occur at precisely the level where the largest spine arises, and two 

 near each of most of the other large branches. In many cases 

 the oscula lie directly at the bases of the large branches, their 

 crater-like rims being continuous on one side, most often above, 

 with the substance of the branch. Looking through the oscula on 

 to the gastral surface, this is seen to be formed of a fibrous network 

 of spicules, without the woolly surface covering of loose spicules. 



The specimen is a macerated one ; as I was unable to dissect 

 or section it, the arrangement of the chambers and the exact ar- 

 rangement of the spicules could not be determined. The bulk of 

 the skeleton of the sponge wall is, however, chiefly composed of 

 bundles of long fibre like diacts of various sizes and characters. 

 These are disposed in bundles which run longitudinally through the 

 sponge body, but divide and reunite in such a way as to form a net- 

 work, in the meshes of which the oscula open, and which raise more 

 or less evident ridges on both gastral and dermal surfaces. In the 

 upper part of the sponge these diacts remain free, but below they 

 are cemented together as above described. They exist in great 

 variety, but the majority have the form re[)resented in Plate XX, 

 fig. 1, in which the transverse rays are reduced to minute nodules; 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 433 



in others they are much more evident, or may be entirely wanting. 

 Some of this type are straight, but most are more or less curved, 

 those surrounding the oscula being often sen)icircular. The ends 

 may be simply pointed, or variously enlarged, and either smooth or 

 roughened with minute spines as shown by a few exain}>les in 

 Plate XX, figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5. The dermalia consist of sword shaped 

 hexacts, which are so numerous as to suggest the specific name of the 

 species. Like the diacts, these differ much in the relative develop- 

 ment of the several limbs, any of which may be straight or more or 

 less curved or even sharply bent. Fig. 9 shows the most typical 

 proportions, but the handle may be scarcely longer than the blade 

 or not more than J as long. The cro-ss pieces may be straight or 

 curved, or sharply bent upward (Plate XX, fig. 12). The handle 

 differs most, being slender and pointed, club-shaped or knobbed, and 

 usually sculptured throughout or at the tip only. The points of 

 the other rays are also usually spinose. The sword handks support 

 the skin, and are not furnished with floricomes at their distal ends ; 

 instead they are surrounded by bundles of minute acicular diacts, 

 Plate XX, fig. 7. 



The hypodermalia are regular hexa-rts.oxy-hexasters, which have 

 the principal rays prolonged (Plate XX, fig. 8), rosettes which vary 

 in the length of the princi[)al rays, as shown l)y two examples in 

 Plate XX, figs. 14 and 15, and discohexasters of great beauty and 

 symmetry of form. One of the simplest of the latter is shown in 

 Plate XX, fig. 16. This has the principal rays well developed, while 

 each group of terminal rays has sixteen members, the pin-head 

 shaped disks having again 10 marginal teeth. Other discohexasters 

 have the numl)er of teriniiuil rays much greater, or the priiu-ipal 

 rays shortened, so that all appear to arise from a central sphere. 



The gastnilia are also sword-sha[>ed hexacts without bundles of 

 accessory acicular spicules. This sponge would appear to be the 

 type of a new subfamily of EuplecteIIid;e.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN CREPIDULA. 

 BY EDWIN G. CON KLIN, PII. D. 



I. The genu3 Crepidula Lam. is represented on our North Atlan- 

 tic Coast by al least three species, viz. : C. jornicata Lam., C. plana 

 Say, and C. convexa Say, while the species C. adunca Sby. and C. 

 navicelloides are abundant on the Pacific Coast of the United States. 



All these species are more or less completely sedentary, and they 

 are usually, though not invariably, carried about by other animals 

 with whom they are messmates and upon whom they are securely 

 fixed. All the larger species of Crepidula are immovably fixed to 

 one spot, e. g., C. Jornicata, C. plana, C. navicelloides, while the 

 smaller species C. convexa and C. adunca are able to move about to 

 a limited extent. 



Among these smaller forms the cliaracters of tlie shell arc fairly 

 constant, but among the larger forms it is well-nigh impossil)le to 

 tell what the normal or usual fuiu is; this is especially the case 

 with C. plana, where it is a rare tiling to find two shells alike. 



Even among the smaller species there are inarked local varieties 

 depending upon the immediate environment, e. g., C. convexa as 

 found on Ilhjonassa and Litiorina shells is deej)ly convex and very 

 darkly pigmented. On oyster shells it is very much flatter and 

 lighter in color, and is frequently mottled as shown in Plate XXI, 

 Row 2. This local variety has been considered a distinct .«petic9, 

 viz.: ('. (jlauca Say; its anatomical and embryological characters 

 show, however, that it is not specifically di.><tinct from C. convua. 

 The same is true of Lea's species, C. acuta, which is merely a loinl 

 form of C convexa. 



Among the larger and more sedentary species, C. Jornicatn and (.'. 

 plana, the most remarkable diUc'rences in the shape of the shells may 

 be observed due to the character of the surface upon which they are 

 attached. " I'pon a smooth, plane surface, the shell is regular and 

 unusually l»roa<l and flat ; on a convex surface it is deep and higbiy 

 arched ; on a concave surface it is concave ; on a twisted surface, such 

 as the columella of Xrverifa, it is twisted ; on an irregular surface, t 

 such as a rough stone, it is irregular; if pressed upon from the .-ides, 




486 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



tlie niiiiiial and sliell become long and narrow ; if growth is limited 

 in froi:t, the shell becomes short and broad ; if limited on all sides, 

 the shell may increase greatly in thickness but remains small in area, 

 completely tilling the space in which it is found. In such cases, the 

 lines of growth are crowded close together, and the very edge of the 

 shell may be as thick as any other portion. 



"The cause of these variations is not far to seek ; the shape of the 

 shell is conditioned by the shape and position of the mantle edge; 

 the mantle is moulded over the surface upon which the animal rests; 

 and consequently the shape of the shell comes to correspond in time 

 to any sort of a surface upon which the animal is attached.'" 



Arnold Graf^ has described a case in which a shell of C.forni- 

 caia was marked by radial folds corresponding to those of a Pecten 

 upon which the Crepidnla was attached. I have, myself, repeatedly 

 noticed similar cases. 



More recently, Bradney B. Griffin,' has called attention to a Pla- 

 ciianomia shell which was found attached to a valve of Saxidomus, 

 and which was marked by lines and folds exactly coinciding with 

 the concentric markings of the SaxUlomus. 



GrifBn also remarks that many similar phenomena have been ob- 

 served and commented upon by paleontologists in fossil shells, and 

 he refers particularly to two papers by Keyes* on the modifications 

 of Plafyceras shells due to the surface of attachment. 



All these modifications are similar to those which I have observed 

 in Crepidida, and are, undoubtedly, due to the causes which have 

 been mentioned. 



Such irregularities of form could scarcely be called dimorphism, 

 though they might properly enough be called environmental poly- 

 morphism. In no case which I have observed is there any evidence 

 that any of these modifications of form are becoming hereditarily 

 fixed, though they may be found in many individuals and have fre- 

 quently been considered of specific value (e. g., Crepidula glauca 

 and C. acuta).

II. An interesting case of environmental diniorphisni to which I 

 wish to call attention is found in a race of dwarfs which is specifi- 

 cally identical with C. plana (Plate XXII, Rows 3 and 4). 



This species is found most abundantly inside dead shells oi Never- 

 ita inhabited by the large hermit crab, Eupagurus Bernhardus. In 

 this position individuals grow to a large size, mature females fre- 

 quently reaching a length of 2 inches and a breadth of 1 ] inches. 

 On the other hand, the dwarfs referred to are found within dead 

 shells of Illyonassa or Littorina inhabited by the little hermit, Eupa- 

 gurus longicarpus, and never exceed ? inch in length by I in breadth, 

 i. e., they are al)out i the linear dimensions of the larger form. I 

 removed from their shells a large number of individuals of both the 

 common and the dwarfed forms, and estimated the volume of the 

 body in the following way : The individuals were first placed on 

 blotting paper to remove any excess of water, and then a given 

 number were dropped into a known volume of water in a finely gradu- 

 ated tube. In this way the average body volume con hi be deter- 

 mined with sufficient accuracy. The results of very many such 

 measurements in which n)ature females of all sizes were taken with- 

 out any conscious .selection of large or small individuals show that 

 the average body volume of a mature female of C ])lana is s cc. 

 while tlie average volume of a mature female of the dwarf variety is 

 j'o cc, i.e., the average body volume of the typical form is about 

 thirteen times that of the dwarf This disproportion in size would 

 V>e much greater if comparison were made between the largest indi- 

 viduals obtainable in the two classes since the dwarfs are much more 

 uniform in size than the type forms. 



This dillerence in size is not due merely to differences in the age 

 of individuals compared, since only .sexually mature females were 

 chosen for purposes of measurement; all the individuals measured 

 were carrying egg mas.xes, and uiile.».« we asMiinf that sexual matur- 

 ity appears much earlier in the dwarfs than in the giants, we nnist 

 conclude that they were of approximately the same age. A careful 

 study of the shells of the dwarfs and giants also strengthens the view 

 that the former are, on the wh(de, as old as the latter; for while the 

 dwarf shells are much smaller and more delicate than those of the 

 giant.-^, they are, in no sense, immature in shape or character ; the 

 lines of growth are closely crowded tf)gether, the margin of the shell 

 is frcfpiently thickened, and its general shape differs from that of an 

 immature shell. 




438 PROCKEDINGS OF THK ACADEMY OF [1898. 



The dwarfs are perfectly formed in all respects, and all organs of 

 the body seem to be reduced in size in about the same proportion.* 

 Strangely enough, however, the cells composing the various organs 

 of the dwarfs are not reduced in size. It must follow, therefore, that 

 a smaller yiumber of cells are present in the various organs and also 

 in the entire body of the dwarf than in the giant. It is an almost 

 impossible task to count the actual number of cells present, even in 

 a very small organ. I have, however, been able to count the num- 

 ber of cells in a cross section of the rectum, and while the size of the 

 cells here, as everywhere, is the same in both varieties, the number 

 of tlie cells in the sections is greater in the giants than in the dwarfs. 

 Of all the cells of the body the ova are most readily enumerated ; 

 they are laid in capsules which can be easily counted, and each of 

 which contains a nearly constant number of eggs. Oft repeated ob- 

 servations show that, without exception, the fertilized but unseg- 

 mented eggs of the dwarfs are of exactly the same size as those of 

 the giants, but are very much fewer in number ; e. g., the following 

 table of averages has been obtained from a large number of obser- 

 vations : — 



Diam. of egg. No. of caps. Eggs in caps. Total No. 

 C. plana (type) .136 mm. 51 176 9,000 



Cp/ana (dwarf). 136 mm. 48 64 3,070 



It is notable that the number of capsules formed is nearly the 

 same in the two varieties, though there is a great difference in the 

 number of eggs inclosed in each capsule. 



In Crepidula, ther.efore, the cell size is constant, and variations in 

 the size of the body are due to variations in the number of cells 

 present. 



This conclusion leads naturally to an inquiry as to the cause of 

 the smaller number of cells, and hence the smaller size of the body 

 of the dwarfs as compared with the giants. In this connection it 

 will be remembered that Semper* long ago observed that the pond 



* It is worthy of note that certain organs, particularly the gill filaments, are 

 reduced in numier in the smaller individuals but not in nize, e. g., the num- 

 bers of gill filaments in three different individuals were as follows : —

 Immature female . Vol. of body. .05 cc, Gill filaments, 53.

snail (Limnced sUignall^) remained small when grown in a small 

 <juantity of water, while the larger the quantity of water, up to 4,000 

 or 5,000 cc, the larger the snails reared in it. As the result of nu- 

 merous experiments, Semper concluded that this diflerence in size 

 was not due to differences in the quantity of food, inorganic salts or 

 oxygen obtainable, and he suggested that some unknown substance 

 must be present in the water which acts as a stimulus to growth 

 without actually contributing to it. 



More recently, DeVarigny' has repeated these observations, and 

 concludes, as the result of several experiments, that the relative vol- 

 ume of the water, in which the snails are grown, is much less import- 

 ant than tlie relative amount of surface exposed. He holds that the 

 larger the surface the more exercise the animals are able to lake, 

 and, therefore, the larger they become. His results show that Sem- 

 per's conclusions are untenable, but they by no means establish his 

 own. It is certainly not generally true, as he holds, that physiolog- 

 ical or mechanical impedimenta to movement result in dwarfing. 

 The larger forms of C. plana are as immovably fixed as the dwarfs ; 

 in this case, therefore, movement can have nothing to do with body- 

 size. 



In Crepidula, the dwarfed form is unquestionably correlated with 

 the smaller size of the shell in which it has found lodgement. It is 

 possible that the diminished size is due to diminished supply of food 

 or oxygen ; however, the following ol)3ervation is opposed to this 

 view : I have never found more than one mature female in a shell 

 inhabited by the small hermit, whereas, from four to eight very 

 large individuals may be found in the shell of a large hermit ; under 

 these circumstance.^, it seems very improbable that the diflerence in 

 size is due to differences in the amount of food or oxygen obtainable. 

 The most natural interpretation is that the dwarfing is due to pres- 

 sure which limits growth in various directions ; though it must be 

 confe8.-<ed that the shell of the dwarf remains thin and delicate, 

 whereas, the shells of the common form which are limited in growth 

 by surrounding hard parts grow thick and have a distorted appear- 

 ance. The fact, also, that the males of all these species, and espe- 

 cially of C plnnn, remain very much smaller than the females (as is 

 pointed out in Section III j, speaks against the view that the smaller 

 size is due to a diminution of food or oxygen, since the males have 



'DeVarigny, Experimental Evolutioo, 1891. 




440 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



the same opportunities in this regard as the niucli hirger females; 

 and the fact that the males are in no case limited for space in which 

 to grow, as are the females, makes against the view that their small 

 size, as compared with the females, is due to pressure. On the whole, 

 it seems to me, that some factor, other than those mcntioDed, is in- 

 volved. 



Whatever the cause of the dwarfed form, it will be noted that in 

 Crepidtild it operates by stopping cell-growth and division, and the 

 real causes of so fundamental a phenomenon are worthy of a more 

 extended study than I have, as yet, been able to devote to it. 



There is good evidence that these dwarfs are not a permanent va- 

 riety or race. In the first place tliere are no anatomical difference* 

 between the two varieties save size only ; secondly, the eggs, em- 

 bryos and larvi^e of the two cannot be distinguished • thirdly, there 

 is evidence that the dwarfs do not produce enough eggs to continue 

 the variety in its present numbers, for since the type and rate of de- 

 velopment are the same in the two varieties, it is probable that rel- 

 atively no more individuals will come to maturity in the one case 

 than in the other, and yet every giant female produces three times 

 as many ova as are produced by a dwarf; the relative number of 

 these two varieties remains practically constant from year to year, 

 and, therefore, I think it must follow that the ranks of the dwarfs 

 are continually recruited from the descendants of the giants. Both 

 live together on the same beach under about the same conditions of 

 food, temperature and water, the embryonic and larval develoj)ment 

 of both forms are identical, and it seems probable that the adults of 

 both would be the same if one was not forced by the smaller quarters 

 which it inhabits to remain smaller than the other. But what is 

 still more conclusive is the following observation : A few specimens 

 were found which showed by the shape and character of their shells 

 that at one time they had been typical dwarfs; afterward, having 

 been detached, they obtained a new foothold on a larger surface, 

 and their shells increased in size, the new portions of the shell be- 

 coming shaped so as to fit the surface upon which they had found a 

 new home. In every such shell one can recognize both the dwarf 

 and the normal forms. The dwarfs are what they are by reason of 

 external conditions, and not because of inheritance ; they are, in 

 short, a physiological and not a morphological variety. In such a 

 case the shape and size of the body, as well as the number of cells 

 in the entire organism, are greatly modified by the direct action of 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELnilA. 441 



environment. But in this case, as in that of the irregular shells 

 mentioned above, I have found no evidence that these modifications 

 have become in the least degree heritable. 



III. Marked as is the environmental dimorphi.-m in C plana, the 

 sexual dimorphism is even greater. The average body volume of a 

 mature male of this species is about I'j cc, while the volume of an 

 adult female is about § cc. ; that is, the average female is almost 15 

 times as large as the average male. In all species of Crepidnhi the 

 males are smaller than the females, though the difference in size is 

 greatest in C. "plana. The following table gives the actual and rel- 

 ative sizes of males and females of the different species : — 



These averages are derived from the measurement of at least 20 ma- 

 ture individuals of each sex. 



In the case of the males as in that of the dwarfs, the smaller size 

 of the body is due to the smaller number of cells pre.-ent rather than 

 to the smaller size of the cells. Careful measurements of cells of 

 the intestine, stomach, liver, kidney, muscles of foot, epithelium of 

 gill chand)er, and epithelium of gill filaments .«how that the cell size 

 remains the same in the male a.-' in the female. Whatever the ulti- 

 mate cause of the smaller size of the males may be, it operates in 

 this case as in that of the dwarfs by causing a cessation of cell growth 

 and division. 



In all these species the males are almost invariably found mounted 

 u[>on the shells of the females, and in jilann, adtincn and convexa 

 they are al)le to move al)out more or lef^s freely, but the full-sized 

 males ofjornicata are as immovably fi.xed to one spot as are the fe- 

 males. In such cases sexual union could take place only between 

 individuals attached near to each other. On muddy bottf)ms Cfor- 

 nic/ifn has the habit of piling together, one individual on top of 

 another, until there may be as many as ten or twelve individuals in 

 a single chain ; such chains are often found in which there is not a 

 single male, and yet I have never found an unfertilized female. 

 Again, perfectly isolated females with large numbers of fertilized

eggs are of frequent occurrence. In such case.'^ I was, for a long 

 time, puzzled to know how the eggs came to l)e fertilized. I after- 

 ward found by a study of serial sections that in the females of 

 all the species there is a seminal receptacle in the form of a con- 

 voluted tubule which opens into the oviduct, and in all mature 

 individuals this is filled with spermatozoa. These spermatozoa are 

 attached by their apices to the walls of the recej)tacle ; it is prob- 

 able that they receive nutriment from these walls just as they do in 

 the seminiferous tubules of the male, and that they can live indefi- 

 nitely in this position. Since there are myriads of these spermato- 

 zoa in the receptacle, and since they are carefully conserved, as is 

 shown by the facts that polyspermy rarely, if ever, occurs, and that 

 no superfluous spermatozoa are found in the egg capsules or oviduct, 

 it might well be that one sexual union would suffice for a life time. 

 In some such way as this must be explained the fact that perfectly 

 isolated females of C.fornicata lay eggs which are always fertilized, 

 though both the full grown males and females of this species are 

 perfectly sedentary. 



In the case of the other species named, the males are never im- 

 movably fixed to one spot, they are able to move about slowly upon 

 the surface of attachment, and, if detached, can obtain a new 

 foothold ; their shells, also, are not distorted so as to fit irregular 

 surfaces as is the case with the females. In, all cases locomotion is 

 limited to small individuals. The young of all species and of both 

 sexes crawl about freely and raj)idly. In C. convexa individuals of 

 both sexes retain this power to a limited extent, but the large fe- 

 males of ac?M/*ca, navicelloides and pla)ia become firmly fixed, whereas 

 the males of these species remain relatively small and retain, to a 

 certain extent, their power of locomotion. The larger any individ- 

 ual becomes, the more limited are its powers of movement, and it is 

 evidently in relation to this fact that the males are so much smaller 

 than the females ; because of this marked sexual dimorphism, the 

 large and sedentary females may be repeatedly, or, in C. foruicata, 

 perhaps once for all, visited and fertilized by the smaller and motile 

 males. 



In C. plana the shell of the male is more nearly round than that 

 of the female, and is usually sharply pointed at the apex ; it is 

 thicker than an immature shell, the edges being thickened and the 

 lines of growth crowded together as is the case with the dwarfs. These 

 •characters are so constant that it is usually easy to distinguish a

male from an immature female, as is shown in Plate XXIII, where 

 immature individuals are shown in the first row, mature males in 

 the second, and an immature female at the right end of the third 

 row. To the left of this immature female are shown a number of 

 individuals in which the older part of the shell has the male char- 

 acters, while the newer part has those of the female. " In such ani- 

 mals the ])enis is usually very small, and, in some cases, has almost 

 entirely disappeared. Quite a complete series of stages in the de- 

 generation of this organ was observed, from the fully-formed organ 

 on the one hand, to a minute papilla on the other. Sections of such 

 animals show that neither male nor female sexual cells are produced 

 at this time. The evidence seems to favor the view that we have, 

 in these cases, an example of proterandric hermaphroditism, but I am 

 not able to assert that this is really the case, although I have spent 

 much time in attempting to decide it."" Further, I have not stud- 

 ied a sufficient number of cases to be able to decide whether this is 

 a regularly occurring phenomenon or only an unusual and abnor- 

 mal approach to hermaphroditism.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE HYMENOPTERA OF 

 BRAZIL, NO. 5. VESPID.^. 



BY WILLIAM J. FOX. 



This paper relates solely to the social wasps, which are, in the 

 present author's opinion, not only distinct in their habits from the 

 solitary species, but differ al^o in having the middle tibia} always 

 with two spurs. 



In stating the sex of a specimen throughout this })aper I have not 

 been quite sure whether certain specimens represented females or 

 workers, and therefore, when the sex represented is other than the 

 male, I have written female, or worker. 



I understand it is the intention of Mr. Herbert Smith to contrib- 

 ute a memoir on the nests of these in.sects of which he has a large 

 number. These are at present stored away in boxes and are 

 unavailable. Therefore, for the descriptions of the nests of the new 

 and other species noted herein thor>e interested must await Mr. 

 Smith's return from South America where he expect,s to pass two 

 years collecting natural history specimens.

abdomen whitish above; costal cell quite ferruginous, the wings 

 not whitish, dark subhyaline. 



4. Head, thorax, legs and petiole quite brown, the cheeks, jirono- 

 tuni laterally, postscutelluin, middle segment apically, and body of 

 abdomen pale yellowish ; wings colored as in No. 3. 



5. Entirely brown ; ])osterior margin of pronotum, two spots ou 

 scutelkim and j)ostscutellum, apical margin of segments 1-5, and 

 greater part of sixth, yellowish wings as in No. 3. {=arborea f). 



6. Dark brown, the thorax above black ; first abdominal segment 

 narrowly yellow at apex ; wings as in No. 3 ; size large. 



It is quite probable thatyl. virginea and arborea are only varieties 

 of A. pallida.

Synoeca azurea i^auss. 



One specimen, Chapada, December. In addition to the bluer 

 color and prominent tubercles of petioles this species is peculiar for 

 its small head which is barely as wide as thorax. 



The collection also contains a single S specimen with the second 

 submarginal cell greatly narrowed above, the distance between the 

 first and second transverso-cubital veins at the top less than that 

 between the recurrent veins on the cubital vein. The head is about 

 as wide as thorax. Otherwise it is very close to surinama.

 than most of body : head in front, cheek.>;, hind margin of pronotnm, 

 tegul.'c, scutellum, jxtstscutelluni, apical margin of segment 1 and 2, 

 and 3-0 entirely yellow. 



9 . — Clypeus longer than broad, obtusely angular anteriorly ; 

 ."pace between hind ocelli about equal to half that between them and 

 eyes, the latter separated from l)ase of mandil)le.'< by a di.«tance equal 

 to the fourth, fifth and lialf of sixth joints of antcnnjc; pronoluni 

 strongly margined ; dorsulum nearly one-quarter longer than broad ; 

 middle segment with indi.-tinct transverse striations. Length Ifi- 

 17 mm. 



5. — Antennie hunger; striation of middle segment coarser. 



Chapada, February to April. Related to P. carnifex, but is much 

 smaller, with black sides of thorax, comparatively longer clypeiis. 

 It is larger than 1'. riifirornis, of which it might be taken for n ^ 

 variety, and the clypeus is much longer. The coloration is quite 

 con.stant in the six specimens before me.

Polistes geminatus n. sp. 



Head, clorsulum ami abdomen black ; mouth, antennre beneath 

 basally, thorax on sides and beneath, legs and base of first segment, 

 reddish-brown ; inner and posterior orbits, ciypeus at sides and 

 apically, inner margin of mandibles, scape beneath, line on pronotum 

 anteriorly and i)osteriorly, tegular, line on anterior part ofscutellum 

 and postscutellura, two broad stripes on middle segment, a small 

 spot near base on each side, s])ot at sides of scutella, and at top of 

 nietapleiirre, stripe on four hind coxfe, apex of middle segment, two 

 spots on first segment of abdomen, its posterior margin, and posterior 

 margin of segments 2 and 3, or 2-4, narrowly, yellow; wings light 

 fuso-hyaline, costal cell somewhat yellowish; femora sometimes 

 striped with yellow. 



9 • — Ciypeus about as broad as long, obtusely angular anteriorly, 

 rather distinctly punctured ; space between hind ocelli equal to 

 nearly two -thirds of that between them and eyes, the space between 

 the latter and base of mandibles not equal to the width of the latter ; 

 pronotum margined ; dorsulum more than one-quarter longer than 

 broad. Length 14 mm. 



Var. — Ciypeus entirely black ; femora striped with yellow ; lateral 

 spot of first segment coalescing with the yellow at apex. Length 

 13 mm. 



Chapada, March. Two specimens. Resembles P. cinerascens, but 

 differs in color of wings. In the bi-spotted first segment it seems to 

 have some resemblance to P. higuttatus, but that species is quite 

 differently colored, judging from the description.

 Both forms seem to occur in the same localities simultaneously. 

 From Chai)ada, Santarem and Rio de Janeiro, March, April, Sept-

The series before me shows that in coloration this species merges 

 from the form figured by Saussure on PI. XXV (fig. 2) of his work, 

 abdomen brownish or blackish, into the species known as fulvo-

Four specimens from Rio de Janeiro in November, are perhaps 

 this species, as near as can be judged from the description. The k'gs

 wings brownisli basully and in the costal cell, otherwise dark sub- 

 hyaline, with nervures and stigma brownish ; third subinarginal 

 cell rhomboidal, higher than long, its outer nervure strongly .sinuate. 

 Length 12-13 mm. 



Chapada, October. Three specimens. Belongs apparently to 

 Saussure's IV Division My., and is allied to P. constructor. Viewed 

 from above the shape of petiole greatly resembles the lower part of 

 a horse's fore leg seen from the front, the swollen portion represent- 

 ing the hoof. 



Polybia flavitincta n. sp. 



9 or 5. — Black, with a dense silky,brown pile; flagellum, tegulse 

 and legs from tip of femora, ferruginous brown ; a narrow line on 

 pronotum posteriorly, and at apex of petiole, yellowish. 



Clypeus a little broader than long, with a few large punctures 

 anteriorly; ocelli in a high triangle, in consequence of the hind pair 

 being much closer than they are to the anterior one ; flagellum sub- 

 clavate, the firstjoint a little longer than the two following united ; 

 eyes almost reaching the mandibles ; pronotum tolerably well devel- 

 oped above, not margined or ridged ; dorsulum broad and short, its 

 length barely one-fifth greater than its width ; middle segment short, 

 almost perpendicular, strongly sulcate down middle, and with dis- 

 tinct separated punctures, and silvery pile apically ; petiole of 

 abdomen elongate, about as long as hind femur, slender basally and 

 suddenly broadened beyond middle, so that it presents an infundi- 

 bulate appearance; remainder of abdomen short-ovate; superior 

 wings strongly yellowish anteriorly, otherwise the wings dark sub- 

 hyaline, nervures and stigma yellowish ; second submarginal cell 

 quite triangular; third submarginal rhomboidal, higher than long, 

 distinctly narrowed above, its outer nervure a little curved near the 

 toj). Length 14 mm. 



Santarem. Two specimens. Allied to P. higuhris. In colora- 

 tion it more closely resembles P. angulicallis, but the prothorax is 

 not produced as in that species. 



Polybia tinctipennis n. sp. 



9 or 5 . — Black, with browni.«h silky pile ; legs and tegulrc 

 brown ; posterior margins of pronotum and petiole with an obscure

narrow, yellow line ; superior wings fuscous on basal two-thirds, 

 especially in costal cell with dark nervures, the apical third whiti.-h- 

 yellow, with yellowish nervures and stigma. 



Clypeus subcordate, nearly as broad as long, with large scattered 

 punctures throughout ; ocelli forming an almost equilateral triangle, 

 the space between hind pair, however, slightly less than that sepa- 

 rating them from the anterior one, and not nearly equal to half the 

 distance between them and eyes; the latter not reaching base of 

 mandibles, being separated from them at their closest proximity by 

 a distance nearly equalling the length of fourth antennal joint ; 

 pronotum short, finely margined or carinated at the sides anteriorly, 

 but not medially ; dorsuhim at least one-quarter longer than broad ; 

 scutelhim, postscutellum and metathorax strongly punctured, all 

 three more or less sulcate down middle, especially the middle 

 segment which has the furrow much broadened apically ; sides of 

 thorax strongly punctured ; petiole, distinctly punctured, shorter if 

 anything than hind femur, somewhat clavate, being graduallv 

 broadened from before the middle, the basal third stem-like ; remain- 

 der of abdomen cordate; second submarginal cell short, nnjch higher 

 than long and narrowed above ; third submarginal rhoniboidal, 

 higher than long, somewhat narrowed above, the outer nervure 

 sinuate. Length 18 mm. 



Chapatla, September and December. Two specimens. Belongs 

 to Saussure'a IV Division My. Its resemblance to P. nocialis is only 

 superficial. The shape of petiole is nearly as in 7*. liKjnbru, but is 

 more sleufler. 



Polybia chapadee n. xp. 



9 or 5. — Ferruginous; body of abdomen, sides of prothorax and 

 mesoi)leuric sometimes darker; two broad oblique marks uniting in 

 V-form on front, and tlie occiput black; antennte dark above; 

 clypeus, mandibles except tips, inner anil po-tcrior orbits, two oblirjuc 

 lines on vertex behind ocelli, lines on pronotum anteriorly and pos-

 stripe on hind coxse, spot at tip of all femora, (sometimes ol)8cure), 

 ami apical margin of abdominal segments 1-3 or 1-G, or the firs-t 

 only, yellowish. 



Clypeus about as broad as long, not distinctly punctured ; ocelli 

 forming an equilateral triangle, the space between hind pair a little

less than that between them ami eyes; the latter almost reaching 

 raandihles ; first joint of flagellum as long as the second, third and 

 most of fourth ; pronotum short, margined ; dorsulum more than 

 one-quarter longer than broad; middle segment broadly channelled, 

 down middle almost concave; petiole of abdomen about as long as 

 hind femur, elongate, tolerably slender, broadened gradually and 

 gently from beyond middle; remainder of abdomen ovate; wings 

 dark subhyaline, faintly yellowish in the costal cell ; nervures and 

 stigma brownish; third submarginal higher than long, the outer 

 nervure curved, and just before its junction with the cubital nervure, 

 angulate. Length 15 mm. 



Chapada, February. Three examples. Belongs to Saussure's V, 

 Division Kappa, and is apparently allied to F. raphigastra. The 

 petiole is more broadened at apex than in P. surinajnensis, and the 

 body quite robust. 



Polybia gorytoides n. sp. 



V or $ . — Blackish or dark brown ; head, except a broad trans- 

 verse stripe on vertex, thorax entirely on sides and beneath, pronotum 

 except an oblique stri{)e on each side, two stripes on dorsulum, 

 scutellum and j)Ostsciitelliim exce])t posterior margins, middle seg- 

 ment except in longitudinal furrow, legs (tarsi darker), abdomen 

 entirely beneath, first dorsal segment at sides and apex, apical mar- 

 gin of dorsals 2-6, yellow, that on second dorsal extending to base 

 at sides. 



Clypeus broader than long, with a few large punctures, its fore 

 margin sharply angular; ocelli forming a rather high triangle, the 

 space between hind pair less than that between them and anterior one, 

 and not equal to half the distance between them and eyes; the latter 

 almost reaching base of mandibles ; vertex distinctly punctured ; 

 flagellum clavate, the first joint about as long as the two following 

 united; pronotum indistinctly margined; dorsulum punctured, but 

 not very strongly, about one-fifth longer than broad ; middle segment 

 broadly furrowed, rather flat, and sloping evenly from base to apex ;

1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIIILADELPIIIA. 455 



Var. — Reddish-testaceous, with the yellow marking obscure, the 

 stripe ou dorsulura wanting; black spot on vertex quite j)roniineiit. 



Chapada, September ; Santareiu. Twelve specimens. Belongs 

 perhaps to Saussure's II, Division Iota, but the third submarginal 

 cell is longer than high ; otherwise it agrees with the characteristics 

 of that group. It has a strong superficial resemblance to some 

 sj)ecies of Goryies. The variety mentioned comes from Santarem. 



Folybia sufFasa n. q). 



5 or $. — Black; scape and pedicel, pronotum more or less, 

 body of al)domen, and legs in part, obscure ferruginous-brown ; 

 mandibles, fore margin of clypeus, spot on inner orbits at base of 

 clypeus and at bottom of cheeks, pronotum anteriorly and posteriorly, 

 two spots on mesopleura, one at top of metapleura, scutellum, post- 

 scutellum, middle segment except on sides, base of petiole and a 

 fascia at its apex which is extended along the sides, and a fascia at 

 apex of segments 2-5, yellow; head and thorax with a golden j)ile, 

 not very dense, however. 



Clypeus broader than long, not distinctly punctured, its fore mar- 

 gin acutely angulate; front with shallow punctures; ocelli form a 

 high triangle ; eyes barely reaching base of mandibles, at any rate they 

 are more distant than in P. pediculata, to which suffu'ia is related ; 

 flagellum clavate, the first joint nearly as long as three following 

 united; dorsuluni about as broad aa long; middle segment with 

 shallow punctures, strongly furrowed down middle, more so than in 

 pediculata; petiole, if anything, slightly longer than hind femur, 

 slender, strongly dentate behind middle, and a little dilated from 

 the teeth to apex ; remainder of abdomen cordate ; wing.s sub- 

 hyaline, strongly iridescent; nervures and stigma dark brown; 

 third submarginal longer than high, three times aa long as second, 

 slightly narrowed above, the outer nervurc sinuous. Length 7-8 mm. 



Chapada, May and October. Al)out <)() specimens. This species 

 is closely allied to /'. jiediculata, l)ut differ-^ in coloration, less tri- 

 angular second submarginal, and generally more slender form. 

 The petiole is shaped almost precisely as in ■pediculata. 



Folybia frontali« n. -|.. 



9 or ?J , and i . — Black ; front, clyi>eus and most of scape, red- 

 dish-yellow ; posterior orbits, narrow line on pronotum anteriorly 

 and posteriorly, spot beneath wings, postscutellum except aj)ex, tips 

 of all femora, s])ot at ti])s of four anterior libi;e, and a narr<jw line,

sometimes wanting jit apex of petiole, pale yellow ; mandibles red- 

 dish. 



Clypeiis witli shallow punctures, broader than long, obtusely 

 angular anteriorly ; ocelli forming a low triangle in consequence of 

 the hind pair being nearly twice as far apart as they are from the 

 anterior one, the distance between the hind pair al)out equal to that 

 between them and eyes ; the latter almost reaching base of mandi- 

 bles ; flagellum subdavate, the first joint about as long as the follow- 

 ing two united ; pronotum short, margined ; dorsulum barely longer 

 than broad, middle segment short, rather concave, with a narrow 

 raised line down middle on each side of which there is a furrow; 

 petiole shorter than hind femur, elongate and tolerably stout, gradu- 

 ally enlarged from near base, much more slender than in P. socialis ; 

 remainder of abdomen subovate ; legs robust; wings subhyaline 

 throughout; nervures and stigma dark; third submargjnal cell 

 higher than long, the outer nervure angulate before its junction with 

 the cubital vein. Lengtli 11-12 mm. 



(? . — Colored like 9 oi' $, but having the usual sexual differences; 

 smaller clypeus, narrower front, antennie longer and acuminate at 

 tip ; otherwise agreeing with the preceding description. 



Chapada, October and November. Ten females (workers ?), one 

 male. Allied to P. soda/is, but the more slender petiole excludes it 

 from Saussure's II, Division Iota. These divisions are not natural, 

 however. 



Polybia marginata n. sp. 



9 or $ — Thorax, petiole and legs reddish-brown, the first men- 

 tioned with thin golden pile; head, and body of abdomen black; 

 sides of thorax and petiole apically dusky ; line on inner orbits be- 

 low emargination, on posterior orbits above, line on pronotum 

 anteriorly and posteriorly, fore margin of postscutellum, two lines on 

 middle segment, spot on four hind coxre, and at tip of all femora, 

 pale yellow. 



Head subquadrate, not very transverse; ocelli forming an equi- 

 lateral triangle; first joint of flagellum nearly as long as the three 

 following united ; pronotum sharply margined anteriorly ; dorsulum 

 about one-fifth longer than broad ; middle segment concave medially ; 

 petiole elongate, slender, broadened from beyond middle, altogether 

 more slender than P. sericea, in length greater, if anything, than 

 hind femur ; wings dark, paler apically, black in costal cell ; breadth

 Length 15 nnn. 



Chapada, Sei)teinl)er, October. Four specimens. Is the exact 

 counterpart of P. sericea superficially, but differs by the squarer head, 

 margined prouotum, more slender petiole, shorter dorsuluni, etc.

Differs from ('. Smithii other than in coloration. a>i follows : dor- 

 suluni shorter, nearly as broad as long; scutellum and po<*tscutelhim 

 .smaller, the latter not tuberculate medially ; the wings are crohired 

 as in Smithii, but the superiors have a pale band cro9.«ing them and 

 including the space between the apex of the costal, base of second 

 discoidal, and base of third submarginal cells, the veins included in 

 this region, and tiie stigma are whitish-yellow, elsewhere dark ; neu-

Shell with four whorls, spire prominent, body whorl with from 12 

 to 13 revolving grooves, which form an equal number of smooth, 

 flat, revolving costse ; these average about double 

 the width of the grooves. In one specimen the 

 third and fifth costie from the suture are almost 

 twice the width of the others, and the two lower 

 costaj divided by a minute, impressed line. The 

 first spiral whorl has six, and the second five, re- 

 volving grooves. Apical whorl smooth, suture 

 deeply impressed. Aperture narrow, oblique, lij)

Shell fusiform, whorls convex, the body whorl with about 18 and 

 the spiral whorls with 15 equidistant, flexuous, longitudinal ribs ; 

 numerous fine revolving lines, more prominent between 

 the ribs, and somewhat obsolete on the angles of the ribs, 

 cover the entire shell ; suture deeply impressed. TIk- 

 length of the largest specimen (including the two apiciil 'v 



whorls, which are wanting), is about 20 mill. fc 



I would hesitate in describing this young shell if ii ^^ 



were possil»le t«» determine the s/te^/."? of this group from tli« \] 



figures and description of the casts that have already been

Whorls very convex, with four equidistant, revolving, raised 

 lines, which are crossed by equidistant longitudinal ribs of a corre- 

 sponding size, which form equal, quadrate interstices, except below 

 the suture where the longitudinal ribs become obsolete. At the 

 junction of the two series of raised lines are small tubercles through- 

 out the entire shell. Owing to the imperfect apertures of the five 

 specimens, its generic position remains doubtful, but its distinct 

 sculpture will distinguish the species. Length of the largest sj)eci- 

 mens, 6 mill. ; probably attains the length of about 10 mill. 



Trig onia thoracica Morton. 

 Trigonia eu/aUnsis Gabb. 



There seems to be considerable confusion regarding these forms. 

 That T. eufalensis Gabb is only the young of T. thoracica Morton 

 can be readily proven by the large suite collected by the writer at 

 Eufaula and Prairie Bluff, Alabama. ^Moiton's tyj)e came from the 

 latter locality. The species recorded from Reeve's clay bank near

 Systematic Botany, while the zoological drawings have been placed 

 by Dr. Nolan in accordance with Cams and Gerstaecker. Exhaus-

Much the greater part of the drawings and notes have been 

 contributed by Mrs. Joseph Leidy, to whom the thanks of the 

 Academy are due for thus providing for the preservation of these 

 interesting relics of her distinguished husband. 



Dr. Leidy is unquestionably the most prominent figure in the his- 

 tory of the Academy. This distinction is due not only to the variety, 

 extent and value of his scientific work, but also because of his long 

 connection with the executive offices of the society, as fully set 

 forth in the several biographical notices included in the first volume 

 of the memorial.

It is, of course, through his scientific work that he will he known 

 to succeeding generations, but the personal qualities of the man : 

 his humility, his charity, his integrity, and his transparent truth- 

 fulness can only be fully appreciated by those who were thrown into 

 daily coniniunication with him. 



It is fitting that these volumes shoidd be placed in the Academy, 

 where nearly all of Dr. Leidy's work was done, as an evidence of bis 

 artistic ability and the diversity of his scientific interests, for they 

 not only contain exquisite specimens of draughtsmanship but the 

 drawings belong to nearly every department of natural history fiom

 part scattered, leaving numerous hyaline spaces, one of which 

 appears as an indefinite, indistinct transverse baud at the base of 

 each process. Owing to the irregularity in the distribution of the 

 puncta the circumference of the valve aj)pears to show a scalloped 

 border.

 seen but one specimen which was found by Mr. John A. Shulze who 

 also discovered a variety having two processes at one end and one 

 at the other.

There appears to be no special reason why either this form or that 

 known as Tabulina Testudo Brun. should be separated from the 

 genus Biddulphia. The hyaline lines are not always definite even 

 in Tdbulina Testudo, while the variety in which but three proces.ses 

 appear clearly indicates an approach toward the type of Biddulphia.

NEW SPECIES OF ODONTOSTOMUS FROM BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



The forms noticed below are mainly recent accessions to the col- 

 lection under my charge, received from Dr. H. von Ihering, Ihe 

 Director of the young but progressive Brazilian institution, the 

 Museu Paulista. Three of the species belong to the .subgenu.« of 

 Odontodoinus caUed Macrodoiites, a. groui) characterized by the con- 

 tinuous peristome, spirally lirulate earlier whorls, and regular, fine 

 striation of the later ones, with minute and shallow but close spiral 

 incised decu-ssating lines. This very di.^tinct subgenus contained 

 four species: odontostomxis Sowerby, Jasciatns Dohrii, (irayaitvs 

 IM'r. and corduvamis Pfr. Dr. von Ihering's zoological explorations 

 have already nearly doubled this number. 



All of the species of Macrodontes hitherto known have the aper- 

 ture obstructed by large teeth ; but in. two of the new forms, deijrn- 

 rrafiis and Dautzenbtrfjianiis, the teeth have degenerated to such a 

 degree that they are probably no longer functional as barriers 

 against predaci'nis arthropods. In another, panliMn, the teeth are 

 more strongly developed than in any other Mncrodnntex. 

 Odontostomas i Macrodontes / paulista I'il^liry Jk. v. Iticriii)^, n. "p. 



Shell lengthened fusiform; rather solid; reddish-chestnut, with 

 irregular, lacerated and somewhat zigzag, obli(|Uily longitudinal, 

 liydrophanous, cream-tinted streaks. Surface dull, vj-rv mimitcly 

 but sharply striated in the direction of growth lines, a strong lens 

 showing much more minute and superficial, dense, spiral striation, 

 the apical whorls spirally Urate. Whorls 6, the first turned in, the 

 rest rather rapidiv and regularly increasing, moderately convex, the 

 last becoming free at the aperture, compressed behind the outer lip, 

 the trench there impressed by five pits ; base pinched into an acute, 

 produced keel ; and behirni the columellar li|) there are two pits and 

 a deep axial pit, with another shallow pit behind the elevated 

 l)arictal wall. Aperture slightly oblirpie, narrow, irregularly 

 oblong, obstructed by eight pliciform teeth and a strong, deep-seated 

 Columellar lamina ; peristome continuous, white, reflexed through- 

 out, the outer lij) with two large teeth situated like those in 0.

Alt. 37, (liam. 12 mm. length of aperture (including peristome) 

 15, width 8 mm. 



Iguape, prov. S. Paulo, Brazil (Dr. If. von Thering). 



This most beautiful of the }[iicrodontrs species has liydroj)hanous 

 cuticular markings somewhat like Anris Hauxivelli (Crosse). It 

 differs cons])icuously from the well known 0. odoiifosfomiis in the 

 more slender contour, basal instead of baso-periplieral position of 

 the keel, and the longer and narrower aperture, whi'^h is consequ- 

 ently more filled by the large teeth. There is also one more tooth, 

 and the striation is nmch finer. 0. Grai/dims differs strongly in the 

 less tapering and quite differently shaped l)ase, as well as in lack- 

 ing the median tooth of the outer lip, etc. 



Odontostomus (Macrodontes) Dautzenbergianus n. s]i. 



Shell ol)!ong-()vate, thin, light chestnut with a golden sheen and 

 sparse, narrow oblique or zigzag creamy hydrophanous markings 

 (absent on some S])eciraens) ; surface dull, with very minute but 

 regular and sharp striation along the lines of growth, and much finer, 

 shallower, close spiral lines; the apical 1^ whorls delicately spirally 

 lirulate. Whorls 5, the first with in-turned tip, the rest rapidly in- 

 creasing, convex, the last becoming very shortly free at the aperture, 

 somewhat compressed behind the outer lip, and with three small 

 pits; the base pinched into a short keel, behind the columellar lip 

 two-pitted, with a deep umbilical fissure. Af)erture irregularly 

 oblong; peristome continuous, reddish or flesh colored, narrowly 

 reflexed, the upper margin with a small blunt tooth, outer lip with 

 three small teeth within, the lowest low and wide, the upper two 

 minute and acute, whitish; basal lip with one low, wide tooth, the 

 columella with a strong oblique fold upon which a minute whitish 

 denticle is placed, another one being situated below the colunjellar 

 fold.

Raiz da Serra, Sao Paulo, Brazil (Dr. H. von Ihering). 



This species, to which we have attached the name of a distin- 

 guished French conchologist, is obviously a member of the 0. odon- 

 tostomus group of Mucrodontes, agreeing with those forms in the j)09i- 

 tions of the denticles; but in our species the armature of the apcr- 




1808.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 473 



tiire has degenerated to a series of very small denticles. For the 

 rest, the forra is fuller than any other known Macro(lo7ite.-i. 



A specimen from Cubatad, Sao Paulo, differs from the tyjie in 

 being darker colored, of a dark reddish-chestnut hue, somewhat 

 more solid, with the denticles on the outer lij, and columellar mar- 

 gin subobsolete, hardly noticeable, and of the reddi.<li color of the 

 lip itself; the pits behind the lip are correspf)ndingly obsolete, but 

 there are two minute white denticles on the columellar fold. This 

 shell measures: alt. 26, diam. 10 mm.; length of apertuie 1 1, width

 raised, finely but rather superficially cut into beads by decussating 

 spirals which crenulate the summits of the stri.'c. Sj)ire conve.xly 

 conic, the apex obtuse ; whcjrls nearly 6, quite convex, the earlier 1 ■] 

 densely spirally striated, the last whorl becoming free and somewhat 

 descending in front, constricted and showing 3 small pits l)ehii;d the

 principal laniell:c and one or two smaller denticles or teeth ; one 

 lamella well within on the parietal wall, bifid at its outer end ; 

 one very obliquely entering lamella on the columella; and a third

and undoubted distinctness, so far as specific distinctions can be 

 said to exist in Cerion, we present them as a further contribution 

 to knowledge of this peculiar genus. 



Since writing upon this topic in 1896, we have been unable to 

 procure livinjjor suitably preserved specimens of Ccrion for anatom- 

 ical investigation ; but we have no reason to doubt that such study, 

 when it becomes possible, will justify our reference of the genus to 

 the family Urocoptidce (" Cyliiidrellidce" of authors). 



Respecting the extraordinary plasticity of the shell under the 

 force of varying circumstance, something was said in our former 

 communication ; but as it would seem from questions put to us by 

 various conchological friends, the case was not stated strongly 

 enough. We do not seek paradox when we say that frequently the 

 differences between individuals of a species are greater than the 

 differences between species ; so wide is the swing of racial and in- 

 dividual variation.

This species has considerable resemblance to C. mmuia, but differs 

 conspicuously in the strong development of the parietal fold, the 

 inner termination of which is not visible from the aperture. In

OccurrPHce of Oryzomys palustris in Sont/iern New Jersey. — Mr. 

 Wrr.MER Stone placed on record the capture of two specimens of 

 the Rice-field Mouse, Oryzoviys palustris, in southern New Jersey, 

 on Nov. 21, 1898, by Mr. Henry \V. Warrington. 



The history of the species is of peculiar interest. It was originally 

 discovered in 1816 by Dr. John Bachman at Charleston, S. C. but 

 was not described until 1836 when a specimen and description were 

 sent to Drs. Pickering and Harlan of Philadelphia for comparison 

 with Ord's Arvlcola riparia and for publication if the southern 

 animal proved distinct. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 481 



Dr. Bachiimn named the mouse Armcola oryzivora. Upon com- 

 parison with specinjcns iu the Academy collection Dr. Harhui not 

 only found that Bachman's mouse was cjuite distinct from Ariiola 

 riparia hut also discovered that a niDunted specimen identical with 

 it was already in the collection labelled from " Fastland " near 

 Salem, N. J. 



He thereupon ignored Bachman's nianuscrij)t and described the 

 New Jersey specimen under the name of Mii.'< palu-itris.^ Baird 

 subsequently established the genus Onjzovnj)' for it, and it has since 

 been known as Oryzomy.^ paludris (Harlan). 



Further explorations have shown that the Rice-field Mouse is 

 distributed from North Carolina to Texas but until the present time 

 no other specimens have l)eeii obtained from New Jersey. For 

 some time past Mr. S. N. Khoads has made persistent efforts to dis- 

 cover this animal an<l has trajiped without avail in C'ajie ^\i\y Co., 

 Port Norris, and .Salem. 



As a result of the failures it seemed most jtrobablc that the 

 original Harlan specimen had been wrongly labelled and that the 

 Kice-field Mouse was not a member of the New Jersey fauna. This 

 view had in fact been generally adopted. 



Mr. Warrington's rediscovery of the animal in this State after a 

 lapse of at least sixty-two years is therefore of great interest. 



He states that the specimens were secured on the marshes border- 

 ing Delaware liay about midway between Port Norris and Salem, 

 and that they were inhabiting old Muskrat houses in which they 

 had made their nests. 



Mr. Stone stated further that stops would be at once taken to 

 secure a satisfactory series of the.'»e iiiice for comparison with those 

 of the Carolinas as there is a j)0.«sibility of the latter proving a dis- 

 tinrt 8ul)Spf'cics.

THE GROWTH OF VIBURNUM LANTANOIDES Michx. 

 liY IDA A. KKLLKK. 



During a vidit to Lake Ganoga, Sullivan County, Pa., last August, 

 I found nothing more plentiful than the hobble-bush, Viburmim lan- 

 tiuioides. The long branches of this plant with their large round- 

 ovate leaves, the brown naked winter buds, at that time already fully 

 developed, and the clusters of the then red berries were everywhere 

 conspicuous. There is something strikingly characteristic about the 

 sjjecies. It is described in Gray's Matnwl as a "straggling bush " 

 and in Britton & Brown's Flora as " a bush of irregular growth." 

 On collecting and comparing a sufficient number of specimens I came 

 to the conclusion that there is some peculiar tendency at the bottom 

 of this apparent irregularity and that law and order {)revail in the 

 growth of this seemingly eccentric s})ecies. Although some shoots 

 differ so widely from others that they seem hardly to belong to the 

 same kind of plant it is by no means a difficult matter to find the 

 necessary connecting links. The accompanying illustrations, al- 

 though diagrammatic, are directly drawn from nature and by means 

 of these I have endeavored to show that this so called "irregular 

 growth " is chiefly due to a peculiar method of ramification on the 

 one band, and to a tendency to the suppression of the growth of the 

 main axis on the other. 



Plate XXV, fig. 1 represents a form frequently occurring in 

 younger plants. A main axis and two lateral branches are con- 

 spicuously developed. The important point to observe is the con- 

 tinued growth of the main axis after ramification, which even sur- 

 j)asse8 that of the branches. It n)ay be notictd incidentally at this 

 pcjint that the axis ends with three buds, which are represented on a 

 larger scale in fig. 6. It must also be observed that the axes of the 

 lateral branches cease to indicate vigorous growth after again 

 branching. These axes terminate at a'. Attention niust also be 

 called to the fact that on the ends of the iiranches marked b' there 

 appear but two instead of three buds. Fig. 7, which represents 

 these buds on a larger scale, is a repetition of fig. 6 with one of the 

 lateral buds obliterated.' The lateral bud in each case shows a 



' The suppressed lateral bud occurs occasionally as a rudiment. See figs. 8 

 and 9. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PIirLADKLI'IIIA. 483 



greater elongation of the stem than the central bud. It thus fore- 

 shadows the precedence which it takes iu the future development of 

 the plant. It can be reailily observed that the suppressed lateral 

 bud is the one next the main axis of branch b. 



Comparing fig. 4 with fig. 1, a decided difference in the relative 

 growth of the main axis and its branches is to be observed. This 

 difference is still 'furtlier emphasized by such shoots as the one 

 represented by fig. 3. 



From the foregoing, fig. 5 represents a striking contrast in some 

 respect*. Here we find a short axis terminated at a, with long 

 lateral brandies which are studded with branchlet.s along their 

 upper side. Fig. 2 is the necessary connecting link. This was taken 

 from a low busli with a very short main axis. The right lateral 

 branch resembles fig. 5, while the lateral branch to the left is quite 

 similar to the branches of fig. 1. 



Plate XXV, fig. 5 explains itself if we recall the two buds of fig. 

 7. We can readily see that tliis effect is produced by the vinorous 

 growth of the lateral l)ud witli little or no growth of the main axis. 

 The axes of the branches in their turn are suppressed wiicn the next 

 ramification occurs and the energy of growth is again transferred to 

 the lateral branch of the next series. We have thus produced a 

 so-called false axis, i. e. an axis which is successively formed from 

 the lateral branches of the main axis, the latter continuing to exist 

 with little or no growth. This is well known to botanists as the 

 sympodial method of brandling and is observalile in many of our 

 forest trees. 



In making the drawings I was struck with their resemi)lance to 

 the diagrammatic representations, found in many of our text books, 

 of the cyme, ill which the oldest flower terminates the stem while 

 the main growth continues laterally. C/'ompare, e. g., fig. 4, with the 

 little axillary clusters of H'elf/^li'i or the inflorescence of theCaryo- 

 j)liyllace:e. Furthermore a peculiar mollification of the cyme is 

 well known as the monochasiiim in which there is but one lateral 

 ramification. This finds its parallel in fig. 7. The moiiochasium 

 repeats itself indefinitely and lure aI.~o this peculiar iiietho<i of 

 branching ha-s a decided tendency to coiitiiiue until at limes \\v. luive 

 a false axis who.-<e length is to i)e measured by the yanl. It is 

 curious that the lateral branch which carries on the growth is always 

 on the same side of the axis and ihu.'^ the case is further comparable 




484 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



to the helicoid iiniparoiiscvtiie in wliicli the flowers (here represented 

 by a, a', a", etc.) always fall on the same side of the rliai-his.' 



I lueiition the similarity between this kind of inflorescence and 

 the sympodial method of branching of tiiis species particularly be- 

 cause the inflorescence of Vilnirinoii belonf,'s to the cymose type. 

 The comparison is interesting if not of greater significance. To my 

 knowledge it is not usual to look for, or to find; a correspondence 

 between the method of branching of the vegetative system and that 

 of the flowering system of a species. 



From a comparison of the shoots of Viburnum latitanoides we 

 may draw the following conclusions: 



This species begins its career normally with a n):iin axis ending 

 with a terminal and two lateral buds. 



A tendency soon becomes evident toward retarding the growth 

 of the main axis while the chief growth energy is transferred to the 

 lateral ramifications. 



There is a further tendency to the complete suppression of one of 

 the lateral buds which, however, may be present in rudimentary 

 form. 



In consequence we have the true axis often replaced by a false 

 axis and we may regard V. latitanoides as a bush with a decided 

 tendency to the sympodial method of branching. 



* Revisions to the original type of brandling, re|)resented by figs. 1, ?> and 4, 

 are not uncommon and assist in producing the irregular eflect. See figs. 11 

 and 12.

THE OCCURRENCE OF MARCASITE IN THE RARITAN FORMATION. 

 BY S. IIARBF.RT HAMILTON. 



The Gault formation of Folkstoiie near Dover, England, has long 

 been known to produce the form of marcasite known as "spear head 

 ore " from it^ apjtarent close resemblance to this weapon. So far as 

 I can ascertain this form of marcasite has never been observed in 

 this country where it occurs under similar circumstances as in 

 England. 



The bed.s of the R-.iritan formation at .'^uyreville, near New Bruns- 

 wick in New Jersey, which are largely worked for clay and kaolin, 

 contain a considerable amount of pyrite usually in the form of balls, 

 and concretions, in many instances resembling coprolites. Inibeded 

 in the plastic clays a;^sociated with the.>-e pyrite nodules were found 

 perfect specimens of the spear head variety of marcasite, very closely 

 resembling in size and aj)pearance those from the foreign locality 

 already cited. In some specimen.s the marcasite twins are implanted 

 yCs^ upon pyrite; again, crystals of marcasite were

OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS.' 

 BY DR. R. W. 8IIUFELDT. 



In former papers of mine the classification of various groups of 

 birds has been treated ; their osteology, as a rule, being the anatom- 

 ical system employed and referred to for the purpose. These inve.s- 

 tigations, as many are aware, have not been confined entirely to 

 recent avifaunie, but have also taken into consideration fossil 

 material ; the remains of birds that existed as far back as tertiary 

 time. 



So far as the United States ornis is concerned every family, or 

 indeed, nearly every genus of the recent age has thus been dealt with, 

 and some of the mss. presenting the details of these researches have 

 been published, while the far greater proportion of them tempora- 

 rily await a similar dispo.-iition. It is in this manner that such groups 

 as the Passeres, the Swifts, the Humming-birds, the Goatsuckers, the 

 Trogons, the Kingfishers, and many others have been gone over and 

 iasued in the form of memoirs in different publications, while ujjon 

 the other hand the osteology of entire grouj)3 has been written out 

 and illustrated, and will, when printed, fill in gaps that formerly 

 existed. Among these last, extensive work has al.-jo been done with 

 large and small groups of birds not occurring in this country, a.s the 

 Penguins, the Ostriches, and others. These will not be taken espe- 

 cially into consideration iti the present connection, for the reason 

 that consideral)le unanimity of opinion exi.sts among naturalists 

 with respect to their tiixonoiny ; though probably the Penguins form 

 an exce[)tion to this statement. Commencing in the United States 

 avifauna with the Pygopodes, however, and pjwsing the various 

 groups in review following their linear arrangement in the order in 

 which they are usually printed, we meet not only with single species 

 but with groups of species, the true taxonomic position of which, in 

 the system, ornithologists entertain very diverse opinions. It 

 is to these that it is my intention to refer in the present paper. 

 They have all been closely studied by me osteologically, and in the

490 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



case of many of them tlieir general anatomy lias been investigated, 

 and their biology as a whole given weight. I\Iy views upon the 

 classification and systematic position of some of these families or 

 species now in my mind, have been briefly abstracted and published, 

 either in The Ibis of the British Ornithologists' Union, or in the 

 Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Others there are 

 that have not been so noticed. 



Prior to passing to the aforesaid subject-matter in chief how- 

 ever, it may be as well first to pay some attention to the morpholog- 

 ical characters of birds with special reference to their use iu determin- 

 ing a scheme for the natural classification of the Class. By the 

 natural classification of Aves is meant an orderly arrangement of 

 existing birds into major and minor subdivisions according to their 

 true aflBnities as they actually obtain in nature. That a real relation- 

 ship exists among certain and various tribes of birds, since the time 

 they have, through their evolution, become differentiated from their 

 remote reptilian stock, is a fact that it is feared those who attempt 

 their taxonomy do not always keep impressed with sufficient 

 strength upon their minds. Consequently we often hear of this 

 classifier's arrangement, and that classifier's arrangement or scheme, 

 just as though no real affinities existed, whereas it is the duty of 

 each and every one attempting a taxonomic scheme to discover pre- 

 cisely how the avian tree has thrown out its branches and its twigs, 

 and, if possible, determine the points from where they sprung. 

 Equally useless is it to attempt a classification of birds by selecting 

 for the purpose the ornis of any particular area of the earth's sur- 

 face. Those that enter upon the task by applying to taxonomic 

 ornithology the birds occurring within arbitrary political boundaries 

 as mapped out by man will fail utterly, and such a piecemeal, pro- 

 visional classification will, with the greatest certainty, be broken up 

 the moment the first far-seeing taxonomer tests it with the morpho- 

 logical facts gathered from the entire class, both existing and ex- 

 tinct, as far as they are known to science. For this reason, we 

 must consider all the classifications of birds up to the present time 

 as being merely provisional, in as much as we are yet so far from 

 possessing the necessary knowledge to define the true one, based 

 upon the complete biological history of the Class. A study of the 

 various classificatory schemes that have been i)resented within the 

 last twenty-three centuries will convince any one that there has been 

 just as much of an evolution in this field as there has been in the case 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 491 



of birds themselves. It must be remembered in this connection that 

 even as early as Aristotelian time, birds were classified into groups, 

 and Pliny, adhering to much that had been done five centuries 

 before him, selected only the very obvious characters of the feet for 

 the purpose, which threw all the birds knc. .vn to him, into three 

 divisions, of which a Hawk, a Hen, and a Goo.se were respectively 

 representative. Thus were associated the Ducks and Cormorants, — 

 the Rails and Robins, — and this is what the feet did. Ornithology 

 was placed upon a scientific basis about the middle of the seventeenth 

 century through the labours of Willughby and Ray. They were 

 the first to use the two main divisions of Land and Water birds, and 

 in subdividing, both the bills and feet were used as classificatory 

 characters. For the most part Linnious followed Ray, and in doing 

 80 kept many birds in taxonomic juxtaposition where the aflinity 

 was quite remote. Mergansers and Albatrosses were kept together, 

 as were Divers and Gulls, — and so much for what bills and feet did 

 in those days. Improvement over early authors was very evident, 

 however, and many palpable errors were rectified. From such 

 beginnings the science has grown up, authors and classifiers being 

 more and more numerous with each succeeding generation. Some 

 used one set of characters and some another, but it is to be distinctly 

 noticed that the previous taxonomic schemes have always influenced 

 their followers in later years. Merrem, who in 1812, was i)crhapsthe 

 first to publish a .systematic arrangement of the groups of birds, was 

 doubtless influenced by all that had been accomplished prior to his 

 time, as the wnrk of Nitzsch in j)terylography, Cuvier in structure, 

 and Linna-us and Ray in a nun)ber of external characters. His 

 scheme was a solid contribution to the classification of birds, based 

 as it was upon a variety of anatomical characters, a.s those drawn 

 from the sternum, those from the feathers, those fr«jrn the os.i'cous 

 system, and tho.se from other parts, as the bills and feet. In fact 

 Merrem took a long step in the direction of the truth, or rather in 

 the discovery of the true relationships of birds in nature. 



De Blainville quickly followed Merrem, and again rearranged the 

 avian scheme of classification, fascinated as he was by the characters 

 presented on the part of the body of the sternum. In some direc- 

 tions further advancement was evidenced, however, and this advance- 

 ment later on was powerfully increasecl by the labors of Nitz.-rch 

 who brought into play the arterial system, the song-musclee, the 

 nasal glands, and other morphological features. 




492 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



Tluis from tlie time of Nitzsch down to the present day, the 

 classification of birds has gone through many changes and many 

 phases at the hands of the ornithoh)gists of the succeeding genera- 

 tions as they have passed. The greatest advances have been made 

 since the scientific demonstration of the law of organic evolution 

 and the derivation of birds became known, and these by the men 

 who have studied the subject from that standpoint. Were it pos- 

 sible for us now to know the complete biology of every bird-form 

 that has existed upon the earth since birds as birds came into exist- 

 ence, there would be among ornithologists an agreement of opinion 

 upon their classification, the world over, within a twelvemonth. If 

 half the species that have existed were known, the scheme would 

 almost work itself out. As it is, we probably see to-day in the 

 world's avifauna but a paltry remnant of that enormous and un- 

 known host, and it will be generations yet to come ere there will be 

 a consensus of opinion upon the aflinities of this puzzling and very 

 homogeneous group of vertebrates. When compared with other 

 major groups of animals, either vertebrate or invertebrate, the 

 structural differences to be found among the forms making up the 

 natural minor groups of existing birds are far less apparent than in 

 any one of them. Taken in their entireties, the difference between 

 an Apteryx and a Humming-bird morphologically, is not to be com- 

 pared with what exists when thus contrasted, between such forms, 

 for example, as a man and an Ornithorhynchus among mammals, or 

 between a Lancelet and a Bass among fishes. Birds are an extremely 

 compact group, and the disposition is altogether too prevalent in 

 attempts to classify them, to accord too high rank to not a few of the 

 divisions above the family. Were birds fishes, the entire congrega- 

 tion of them, would hardly make more than a resj)ectable order. 

 They are a lucky lot of closely affined volant feathered reptiles that 

 have specifically multiplied at a wonderful rate since they sprang 

 into existence, and as useful and as charming as the majority of then) 

 are in nature, their taxonomy nevertheless has puzzled the wits of 

 many a man since Aristotle lived, and will doubtless continue to do 

 so in the years to come. To arrive at their true affinities and a 

 natural grouping of the class, it will be necessary to utilize every 

 fact that we possess in regard to their biology; by this it is meant 

 every palaiontological fact; every fact referring to geographical dis- 

 tribution for all time ; every morphological fact ; besides all that is 

 known of their biology, habits, and development. In so far as their 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 493 



anatomy is concerned some of the systems have undoul)tedly proved 

 to be of more value than others in the matter of classification. For 

 example, in this particular the study of the skeleton teaches us more 

 than a comparison of the dermal appendages, but the ossieous 

 system is by no means all-sufficient to meet the ends of taxonomy 

 as some still seem to believe. With regard to this it is easy to agree 

 with what Professor Alfred Newton has said, when commenting 

 upon the value of the work left us by Nitzsch, for " there can be uo 

 part of a bird's organization that by proper study would not help 

 to supply some means of solving the great question of its affinities. 

 This seems to the present writer to be one of the most certain general 

 truths in zoology, and is proliably admitted in theory to be so by 

 most zoologists, but their practice is opposed to it; for, whatever 

 group of animals be studied, it is found that one set or another of 

 characters is the' chief or favorite of the authors consulted — each 

 generally taking a separate set, and that to the exclusion of all 

 others, instead of effecting a combination of all the sets and taking 

 the aggregate." Thus it is, that notwithstanding the relative value 

 of the characters furnished on the part of any particular morpho- 

 logical system, as indicating interexisting affinities, that value is cer- 

 tain to be affected when the facts brought out by a study of another 

 system, as the muscular system, for example, are applied to it. As 

 evident as this is, however, we have not far to seek in order to dis- 

 cover avian classifiers who would be content to base their taxonomic 

 scheme of the class upon some single character of some si)ccial 

 system, as, fjr instance, I)e Blainville did in using only the body 

 of the sternum for the purpose. Such a practice lands one not very 

 far from the plane arrived at by Pliny in the first century. 



Doctor Alfred liussel Wallace in criticising this niemoir of Mr. 

 Blanchard's in The Ibh for the year 1804, says very truly that we 

 should make the greatest errors in classification by following the 

 sternum alone, a.s " for example, the sterna of the Finches and the 

 Flycatchers are scarcely di.stinguishablc, notwithstanding the great 

 dissimilarity in almost every i>art of the structure of these bini.s — 

 their bills, their feet, their plumage, their habit-^, food, and digestive 

 organs. On the other hand, the sterna of the several genera of the 

 Caprimulgidie differ from each other more than those of the most 

 distinct families of the restricted Passeres. The Pee-eaters, the Par- 

 bets, anrl the Woodpeckers, again, are three very distinct families, 

 which, in a classification founded u|>on all parts of a bird's organiza- 




494 rROCKEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



tion, cannot be brought in close contact; and yet, their sterna, 

 according to Mr. Blanchard, much resemble each other. It is evi- 

 dent, therefore, thiit the whole structure of a bird and ils correspond- 

 ing habits may be profoundly modified, and yet the sternum may 

 undergo the important changes, while the general organization and 

 habits are but little altered." So much for the value of single 

 anatomical systems in avian taxonomy, and so much for the value 

 of single characters in any system. Now astothe value of osteology 

 as a whole in the classification of birds, no ornithotomist or classifier 

 of this group of vertebrates will for a moment doubt. Employed in 

 its entirety the osseous system of Aves stands far in advance of any 

 other in settling the question of affinities and affording characters in 

 classification. It has been almost entirely through our studies of 

 the fossil skeletons of birds that we have been enabled to fix their 

 origin in time, or to link them with their extinct reptilian ancestors. 



The researches of the Parkers in the development of the embryo- 

 logical skeleton of birds ; of Huxley in the skull ; and the labors of 

 Macgillivray, Nitzsch, Merrem, De Blainville, L'Herminier, Cuvier, 

 St. Hilaire, Gervais, Blanchard, Eyton, Owen, Garrod, Forbes, Fiir- 

 bringer, Gadow, Lucas, Beddard, and many others upon the general 

 skeleton ; while the study of pakeontological osteology by Milne- 

 Edwards, Cope, Marsh, and their colleagues in the same field, would, 

 when taken in the aggregate go far toward establishing a natural 

 classification, or rather toward indicating the true affinities of birds. 



Still in face of all this we must believe, that osteology is by no 

 means an all-sufficing guide, nor has it been in the mind of the pres- 

 ent writer in his attempts to discover the true kinships existing 

 among birds ; their systematic positions ; and the places the vari- 

 ous natural groups should occupy in any scheme of classification. 



On the contrary the aim has been to examine with care into the 

 results of the anatomical and general biological investigations of 

 birds by whomsoever they may have been undertaken and published, 

 so long as those researches seemed to have any bearing upon the 

 solution of the true affinities of the class. With this in view a very 

 wide field of literature has been considered, and the works of a great 

 many authors examined. All through this, osteology has held the 

 main place, but constantly subject to subordination when factors 

 drawn from other anatomical systems or from the general life-his- 

 tories of the bird-groups, possessed beyond all doubt greater weight 

 and significance. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 495 



Bearing this in mind, and from osteological premises, let us now 

 proceed to examine into tiie probable affinities of certain birds or 

 groups of birds and how we should classify them. An inquiry of 

 this kind would hardly seem to require any apology, in as much as 

 no two systematists of all those who have ])ublished a scheme of 

 classification for Aves, since 1867 when Professor Huxley gave us 

 his, agree upon the position in the system and the affinities of not 

 a few of the natural avian assemblages. Take for example the 

 Grebes and Loons. Huxley associated them with the Larida*, Pro- 

 cellariidai, and Alcidie in his Group Cecomorphae ; Garrod placed 

 them among the Ducks and Penguins, in the Anseres; Forbes in- 

 cluded the Heliornitidie with them, and created a new grou]) Kre- 

 topodes; Dr. Sclater retained them as a family Colyrabidse with the 

 Alcidie in the order Pygopodes ; Reichenow did the same, but added 

 the Penguins to the group, and called the order Urinatorcs; they 

 are a family of a superfamily, and associated with four other super- 

 families, of the Cecomorphre in Dr. Stejneger's scheme; Dr. Fiir- 

 bringer giving still other now names for orders, suborders and genera, 

 places them between the Flan)ingoes and the extinct Hesperornith- 

 ida; ; we find them among the Galliformes in Seebohm's arrange- 

 ment; and finally considered as two .separate orders by Dr. Sharpe. 

 Still other eminent taxonomers, as Cope, Profee-sors Gadow and New- 

 ton, take different views of the subject. In 1890 Professor D'Arcy 

 W. Thompson and the present writer pointed out quite independ- 

 ently of each other the fact that the Loons and Grel)es were de.-icend- 

 ants of the He.speroruithidie, an ojtinion i)revi<)usly expressed by 

 Cope and Fiirbringer. At great variance with this, Professor New- 

 ton, Lydekker, and ^^ar8h, contended that tlie.«c extinct cretaceous 

 divers were sofne kiii<l of a natatorial Ostrich. Tlicfc so-called 

 ostrich or "struthions characters" have been a stumbling-block in 

 times past to more than one avian systcmatist, but I think their 

 real significance is gradually coming to be belter aj)preciatcd as 

 time goes on. The great [)robability is, that there was a time in the 

 former history of the Cla.«9, posi<il)Jy at about the age when Jlesper- 

 ornis flourished, that all birds exiiibiled .such characters in their 

 skeletons. They are retained now only in a few and widely separ- 

 ated groups or families, as the Kiwis, the Tinamus, Ostriches and 

 some others. 



Now apart from a general and .superficial re.-;eniblancc a typical 

 Loon and a typical Grebe are not, to judge from their osteology, as 




496 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



near akin as many seem to think. . Differences of" a very marked 

 character distinguish their skulls, their vertebral columns, their 

 sterna, their pelves, and their limb bones. Still there is a greater 

 similarity between the skeleton of a Loon and a Grebe than there 

 is between a Loon and any representative of the Alcse. About this 

 fact I have satisfied myself after having compared, character for 

 character, as they occur in the skeletons of several species of Loons 

 with the corresponding ones in a number of Grel)es and both with 

 all the Auks found in our United States avifauna, save Cerorhlnm. 

 D'Arcy Thc-mpsou has shown, beyond all question in my opinion, 

 in his paper, On the systematic position of Heaperornis, the affinity 

 of our modern or existing Colymbi with that ancient diver. It 

 would seem then that the time cannot be far distant when naturalists 

 can at least agree upon the relations that these birds bear to each 

 other and to kindred groups. To express this relationship. Loons 

 and Grebes should be associated in one and the same suborder, and 

 a superfamily created for either assen)blage. In a linear classifica- 

 tion, I believe their nearest relatives are the Penguins upon the one 

 hand and the Auks upon the other, with the Heliornithidse in the 

 next place as a related branch, and one more nearly so than the 

 Laridte or the ProcellaritUe. In part, this is believed by Dr. Stej- 

 neger, to be the relationship who, however, widely dissociates the Hes- 

 perornithidre. While this last relationship is fully appreciated 

 by Professor Fiirbringer, that eminent authority nevertheless ap- 

 parently, sees no special affinity, between an Auk and a Loon or 

 Grebe, and so very widely separates the Colymbo-Podicipites and 

 the Laro-Limicoke assemblages. 



Passing next to the anserine fowls, one would think that by this 

 time there W(juld be more or less unanimity of opinion among 

 systematic ornithologists as to the affinities and position of such a 

 homogeneous group. As a family, the existing Anatidte can but 

 contain the Mergansers, Ducks, Geese and Swans, while the outliers, 

 either existing or extinct, are not as a rule very puzzling forms. 

 The anserine affinities of Palamedea are now pretty generally re- 

 cognized ; and there can be no question as to the relationships of 

 the extinct Cnemiornis or Cereopsis. Moreover the relation borne 

 by the Flamingoes to the Anseres has been known for a good many 

 years past, and yet notwithstanding all this we find almost as much 

 diversity of opinion among the classifiers of birds as to where this 

 very natural group belongs, as has already been pointed out in 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 497 



regard to the Fygopodes. After a careful examination and com- 

 parison of the skeleton of Palaniedea, all of our United States Ans- 

 eres except one or two species ; the Flamingoes including the extinct 

 ones, and Paheolodus ; and a great many species and genera of 

 Herons, Ibises, Storks, Scopus, and their allies near and remote; 

 and finally an equal number of the Steganopodes, I was led to 

 believe a year or two ago, that the duck tribe in its widest sense, 

 with the allied suborders containing the Palamedeidje, the Phoeni- 

 copteridre and their fossil relatives, constituted a group, the nearest 

 related branches to which were the Steganojjodes upon the one hand 

 and the Herodiones upon the other. An opinion, practically quite 

 similar to this is entertained by Dr. Sharpe and Dr. Stejneger, 

 while on the other hand. Dr. Gadow places the Anseriformes between 

 the Falconiformes upon the one hand and the Crypturiforrnes upon 

 the other, — which of course is an utterly ditlerent view of their 

 relationships. To discuss these latter here, is obviously out of the 

 question, as it would carry the present i)aper far beyond its limits.

Before turning from the Ansere.s, however, I desire to say that I \ 

 have found some interesting osteological points in the skeleton of 

 Dendrocygna autumnuUs, — one of the tree-ducks. Although present- 




498 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



ing several anatomical peculiarities, this genus is one containing 

 several species of ducks, and ducks not so very far removed from 

 either the Teals, or the Mallard, or \)erha.ps Spatula. There is very 

 little Goose, and still less Swan in the morphology of Dendrocygna, 

 and for what reason the genus has been placed between P/iilacte and 

 Olor in the Check-List it is difficult for me to understand. In 

 the first edition of his Mamial Mr. Kidgway places JJendrocygua, 

 the last genus in the duck-series where the synopses of characters of 

 the Anseres are set forth, while in the part devoted to the diagnoses 

 of species and genera, these Tree-ducks are placed between the 

 Swans and the Geese as in the Check-List. They have as I have 

 just said some peculiar characters about them, and of these, one of 

 the most interesting is the fact that they have complete bony rings 

 surrounding the orbits, as is the case in several genera of parrots 

 "and some other birds. So far as I am aware it is the only genus of 

 ducks that presents this character, — indeed, the only anserine bird 

 that has it. 



Coming to the Cranes and Rails we meet with an interesting form 

 in Aramus giganteus. During the past few years I have compared 

 the skeletons of several hundred species of birds, and written out the 

 osteology of nearly every genus in this country, and among all these 

 have been included the entire Crane and Rail group with all the 

 North American birds in any way related to it. In this manner have 

 Grus, Aramus, Rallus, Porzaiia, Crex, lonornis, Gallinula, Fulica, 

 and others been dealt with, and their skeletal characters arrayed in 

 tabular form in great detail. Without entering upon the general 

 taxonomy of this group, it is an interesting fact, that in so far as the 

 skeletal characters are concerned, Aramus presents two for every 

 one in favor of its affinity with Grua as compared with Rallus, yet 

 in nearly all avian classifications we find this bird arrayed with the 

 typical Rails. Four years ago I published in England, an abstract 

 in which was incorporated some of the facts here stated, with part 

 of a scheme for the classification of this group. Since then I have 

 examined a number of forms at that time not available, and although 

 they have not materially altered my original views, some changes 

 will necessarily have to be made in order to include these facts which 

 have since come before me. 



Of recent years nothing has come to my notice that seems likely 

 to again check the now growing opinion that the Woodpeckers, as 

 another assemblage of birds, see their nearest relatives in the Passeres, 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 499 



and they do not possess those vestiges of lacertilian morphology in 

 the bases of their crania that were formerly supposed to exist there. 

 The double vomers that a few years ago were attributed to them, 

 are now generally conceded to be nothing more than mesial edges 

 of the imperfectly os-sified palatines, as was pointed out by Garrod 

 in 1872. In that year Garrod printed a brief paper in the Ibis, in 

 which he claimed that Gecimis viridis and its allies possessed 

 a median vomer, though it was differently formed from the bone as 

 it occurs among some of the Passerine birds. Nevertheless Dr. 

 .Sharpe as late as 1891, in his extremely useful brochure, Recext 

 Attempts to Classify Birds, still claims saurognathism for the Pici, 

 although in the same paragraph he admits that in this entire sub- 

 order the " vomer is slender, pointed and split " (p. 84). It is not 

 difficult to believe that all of the alleged saurognathous characters 

 in the skull and associated bony arches of the woodpeckers are due 

 to changes wrought in time through the special habits of this 

 particular grouj) of birds, rather than that they stand in evidence 

 as structural remnants inherited from their ancient reptilian ances- 

 tors. 




500 PROCEIcmNGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [1898. 



The follo\Ying annual rej)orts were read and referred to the Pub-

REPORT OF THE RECORDING SECRETARY. 



U'ith a view to supplying matters of interest fur the meetings of 

 the Academy and thereby increasing the attendance, the Committee 

 on Instruction and Lectures has been charged with the duty of pre- 

 paring an announcement of the programme for each mouth, postal 

 card notices being sent accordingly to the members. By this means 

 the average attendance has been slightly increased from 25 to 28, 

 the largest number being 135 and the smallest, at the midsummer 

 meetings, being 6. The communications presented and the discus- 

 sions based on them have frequently been interesting, but, except in 

 a few cases, they were not records of the results of original investiga- 

 tion and were not, therefore, prepared for publication in the Proceed- 

 ings of the Academy. The speakers during the past year were 

 Messrs Skinner, Goldsmith, Rand, Carter, Dixon, Ferrier, Heilprin, 

 Keeley, Woolman, Pilsbry, Chapman, Holman, Stewardson Brown, 

 Calvert, Stone, Frazer, Sharp, Palmer, Spiller, Mills, L. Witmer, 

 Barr, Holman, Lyman, Vaux, U. C. Smith, Willcox, Conklin, Mont- 

 gomery, Chas. Morris, Harned, J. Cheston IMorris, Wells, Brinton, 

 J. Wharton James, Libbey, A. E. Brown, A, F. Witmer and Miss 

 Keller. 



Six hundred and fifty-two pages of the Proceedings illustrated by 

 twenty-seven plates have been issued. Twenty-five pages of the 

 Journal with one plate and a large number of text illustrations have 

 been printed and distributed in the form of an author's edition, the 

 entire expense of publication having been defrayed by Mr. Clarence 

 B. Moore, the continuation of his valuable work on the southern 

 burial mounds constituting the subject matter of the issue. 



It forms the first portion of the second number of Volume XI of 

 the Journal, the continuation, on which the printer is now engaged 

 consisting of Prof. Cope's posthumous paper on the fossils of the Port 

 Kennedy Bone Cave, to be illustrated by four plates of the remains 

 of the new species described, and one by Mr. H. C. IMercer on the 

 general characters of the cave, the mode of making the explora- 

 tions, and his methods of preserving and recording the results, with 

 text illustrations. These papers, it is hoped, will be distributed 

 early the coming year.

Fifty-six papers have been presented for publication during the 

 past year as follows: — Henry A. Pilsbry 6, Henry A. Pibbry and 

 E. G. Vanatta 4, Gerrit S. Miller, Jr. 5, Clarence B. Moore 4,

 and Witmer Stone 1. 



P'ive of these form a portion of the JoiLrwd before alluded to, 

 three were returned to the author, one was withdrawn, one is now 

 about going to press, and one has been held over until next year. 

 The others have been printed in the Proceedingg. It is gratifying to 

 find in this connection that representatives of dej)artments of the 

 United States Government, and of several important edueatioiuil 

 institutions including the Agricultural College of New Mexico, the 

 Inland Stanford, Jr. University, the Smithsonian Institution and 

 the University of Pennsylvania have found it to their advantage to 

 avail themselves of the facilities for securing early date of publica- 

 tion afforded by the modeof issue and distribution of the Academy's 

 Proceediii'/s. It is earnestly urged that as 8ot)n as the Academy's 

 means will permit, the numbers as i.ssued l)e distributed free of 

 charge to all meml)ers of the society in good standing. 



The Entomological Section (Am. Entomological Society) has 

 issued 231 pages and 11 plates of the Knloinologlral Xni's, 128 pages 

 and 2 plates of the Tnnisaetions, and 202 pages of special papers. 



The publications of the Conchological Section during the year have 

 consi.<»ted of 143 pages and 27 i)late8 of the Manual oj Conchologii. 

 This gives a total, e.\clu.-iv(! of the Journal, of 1,3')G pages and 67 

 plates issued since Dec. 1, 1M!>7.

 The stock of tlie publicatious^of the Academy liad been removed 

 in the fall of 1897 to the basement of the new building so as to make 

 room for the office of the Executive Curator and for the growth of 

 the library. Roomy and convenient storage cases had been pro- 

 vided, a new account of stock had been taken, and it was believed 

 that this important part of the Academy's possessions was at last 

 safely and permanently placed, with sufficient room for the additions 

 of many years to come and without danger of being again crowded 

 out by the growth of other departments. It was found later that 

 the basement was not entirely free from suspicion of dampness and 

 that the dust found its way through even comparatively air tight 

 doors and would therefore be objectionable. These evils might 

 have been remedied, but it was impossible to provide against the 

 accident which has made another removal absolutely necessary. 



It occurred on the third of last August in the form of the 

 heaviest rain-fall ever known in this region. Its suddenness and 

 volume was that of a tropical storm. Streets became rapid torrents, 

 the fence on the south side of the Academy's premises was torn 

 down, the excavated lot rapidly filled, with no outlet except through 

 the basement of the new museum building, where the water in a few 

 minutes reached a height of three feet. The publications on the 

 lower range of shelves were soaked, and before they could be re- 

 moved to the upper floors, where as rajjidly as possible they were 

 spread out to dry, they sustained further damage from the mildew 

 consequent on the high temperature and humidity of the season. 

 The recent illustrations by photographic processes will have to be 

 replaced in both Proceedings and Journal as the peculiarly pre- 

 pared paper has been welded by the dampness and pressure into 

 ma-sses of cardboard while the older lithographic plates printed 

 on honest linen paper are comparatively uninjured. The damaged 

 numbers have been {)laced in piles on the upper floors of the 

 new museum building where they are at present safe from further 

 injury except to some slight extent from dust; but the necessity for 

 providing space for the entire stock of the back publications of the 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 503 



Academy whicli will be at once permanent, safe and convenient is 

 one that must be provided for immediately. The importance of 

 this matter is paramount in view of the fact that the reputation of 

 the Academy as a scientific institution depends more on the char- 

 acter of its publications, embodying as they do the notable work of 

 its members during eighty-seven years of its existence, tlian upon the 

 extent of its library and museum. Its publications keep it in com- 

 munication with other scientific societies ; they form the basis of its 

 exchange in the intellectual markets of the world and place it on a 

 far higher plane than that of a mere local club of naturalists. 



Pending an arrangement of the damaged publications on shelves 

 to be provided for them I have not been able to form estimate of the 

 cost of repair. The electro-blocks of the plates which must be re- 

 placed have i)een j)reserved, so that the printing alone will have 

 to be provided for. 



Twenty-one members have been elected. The deaths of eleven 

 members have been announced, four have been drop|)ed and the 

 resignations of nine have been accepted, as follows: — Julius F. 

 Sachse, Charles P. Turnbull, Mrs. L. L. W. Wilson, Charles W. 

 Dulles, fallen W. Lungstreth, Charles Coulter, Kutii Clement, J. 

 Howard Breed and J. I^wis Crew. This leaves a net loss of three 

 from the membership roll. The deatiis of nine correspondents have 

 been reported. 



At the instance of the Secretary of the American Association for 

 the Advancement of Science a (Committee consisting of Messrs. 

 Meehan, McCook, Wilson, Skinner and Nolan was app(jintcd early 

 in the sumnjer to secure the co-operation of the city authorities and 

 representatives of educational cslalilishments with a view to inviting 

 the Association to meet in Phihidclpliia in 189D. The invitation 

 was conveyed by a rej)re>entativf of a joint Committee but was not 

 accepted, the place scIectcMl for the meeting being Columbtis, Ohio. 



The Ilayden Memorial Medal was conferre<l, in accordance witii 

 the recomniodation of the Conmiitlee on Award, on Prof. Otto 

 Martin Torell, the Chief of the CJcological Survey (jf Sweden. 



A note of thanks was unanimously tendered to Miss Anna T. 

 Jeanes for her munificent gift of :?20,<)00 the income of which is to 

 be expended for the improvement and increase of the mu.seun). 



The President of the Academy and Mr. William Wynne Wister,

The decrease during the year in the number of accessions is partly 

 due to a curtailment of the amount appropriated for the purchase 

 of books and partly to the fact that deficiencies in the publications 

 of corresj)onding societies, persistently asked for, had been in a great 

 measure previously supplied, at all events as far as they are likely to 

 be, except by purchase from second hand dealers. 



The facilities for cataloguing have been greatly increased by the 

 purchase of improved cases which not only accommodate the card 

 entries of all the books and pamphlets now in the library but 

 provide ample space for the growth of at least the next fifty years. 



The necessity for increased shelf room, to which attention was 

 called in ray last report, becomes more pressing, especially in the 

 department of Journals. In many instances the accessions are now 

 packed away in such form as to be difficult of access, the disadvant- 

 age being greatly increased by the lack of means for necessary bind- 

 ing. It is strongly urged that both these need : more cases and a 

 larger appropriation for binding, be supplied at an early date. 




1898.] 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA.

Sorae little relief in the way of additional room has been secured 

 by the selecting out and packing away of a number of volumes of 

 official documents, State executive reports, miscellaneous literature, 

 and other material entirely unconnected with the Academy's func- 

 tion. It is suggested that these be disposed of to some library where 

 they will not be .so entirely out of place and where they are likely 

 to be looked for by those interested in them. 



A large collection of duplicate volumes and pamphlets numbering 

 1,096 titles have been arranged and catalogued. It is hoped that 

 means may be furnished for the printing of the list. There is no 

 doubt that the expense would be refunded by sales, while the books 

 would be so distributed as to confer benefit on these acquiring them 

 instead of lying, as now, useless in our storage room. 



Willie the binding during the year of 174 volumes has been un- 

 usually small in amount, it has been unusually important in char- 

 acter, twelve volumes of Gould's folios, embracing the Birds of Nexc 

 Guinea in five volumes and the Birch of Asia in seven, have been 

 bound in a manner befitting the artistic lieauty of the works. The 

 e.Kpense was defrayed from the Wilson Ftind, to which the books 

 themselves were credited, thus materially curtailing the amount 

 available from that source f)r the purchase of additions. The un- 

 bound numbers had, however, been practically inaccessible to students 

 since the com[)letion of the works, whereas they now form an avail- 

 able portion of the ornithological library and a superb addition to 

 the collection of finely illustrated folios which, thanks to the taste 

 and lil)orality of Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, is one of our notable posses- 

 sions. 



A careful enumeration of the library during the year furnishes 

 the f<dlowing results: —

General Natural History, 

 Botany, .... 



Voyage.^ and Travels,

Total, 48,220 



Nearly all the pamphlets above enumerated are bound, the entire 

 collection forming, as noted, 958 volumes. 



The library of the Entomological Section (American Entomolog- 

 ical Society) comprises 2,864 volumes, many of them, however, being 

 duplicates of those elsewhere credited. 



The James Aitken Meigs' library of miscellaneous literature is 

 entirely foreign to the province of the Academy, the scientific por- 

 tions of it having been catalogued and placed when received with 

 the 8{)ecial sections of the main library of which they now form a 

 part. The miscellaneous portion is retained and kept together out 

 of regard for the wishes of the donor John G. Meigs. A shelf list 

 has been prepared but it has not been otherwise catalogued although 

 there is a large amount of material in the collection of indirect 

 interest, sufficient indeed to warrant the preparation of an author 

 and subject catalogue when time can be secured from more pressing 

 matters. 



Excluding, therefore, if it bethought proper, the two sections last 

 referred to, the working library of the Academy contained when 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 509 



counted last August, 43, 381 volumes. The last previous enumera- 

 tion was made in 1888 when there were 30,831 volumes on the 

 shelves; the addition of 12, 550 volumes, therefore, in ten years, is a 

 gratifying rate of increase in view of the strictly special character 

 of the library. 



In two lectures on the literature of natural history delivered in 

 November as introductory to the Acaden)y's Ludwick Institute 

 courses for the year, I had the pleasure of commenting on some of 

 the bibliographical treasures of the library while definini^ the scope 

 and purpose of such a collection. The Academy is to be congratu- 

 lated on the fact that there is probably no other in America from 

 which the subject could be illustrated so amply. 



It gives me renewed plea.sure to again acknowledge my indebted- 

 ness to Mr. Wm. J. Fox for efficient assistance during the year. 



Edw. J. Nolan, 



Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Curators are able to report the collections under their care to 

 be in an excellent state of preservation. 



Besides the preparation and cataloguing of new material received 

 during the year, it has been pos.<il)le to devote considerable atten- 

 tion to the re-arrangement of several departments of the museum. 



Following the plan adopted last year, about half of the wall cases 

 were removed from the uj)per gall(;ry of the old nmscum and erected 

 in the new basement, thus completing the Alcoholic department as 

 originally planned. All the remaining Alcoholics, comprising the 

 Reptilia, Batracliia, Mammalia, and Iiivertebrata were transferred 

 to these cases. The systematic arrangement of the Fishes and 

 Invertebrata has been completed, the latter ns well as the Reptilia 

 and Batrachia having l)een catahtgiurd during the year. 



It might be aflded that the entire zoological collection of the 

 Academy ha.s now been catalogued, except a part of the Mollu.'ca, 

 the dry Invertebrate preparation.^, and iheOsteological preparations 

 of Fi.>*h, Reptiles, and I'atracliianH. 



The magnitude of thi.-^ W(;rk can be aj>pre(i!ite<l when it i.s learned 

 that the combined number of catalogue entries of the vertebrates 

 amounts to sixty-five thousand six hun(lre<l. 




510 PROCEEDINGS OK THE ACADEMY OK [1898. 



Fifteen half-upriglit cases were juirohas'ed during tlio yesir, in 

 which it is intended to arrange tlie dried specimens of Lower Inver- 

 brates. the duplicates being stored in closets, wliich have been pro- 

 vided undorneatli tlie cases. Part of this transter has been already 

 accomplished and when completed it will permit the removal of the 

 remaining wall cases where the Invertebrata have been stored 

 heretofore. 



Two new musenm cases have been placed in position on the mam- 

 mal floor in which are arranged the higher Qiiadriiniana and 

 Carnivora. One of these was provided through the Marv Jeanes 

 Fund, established this year by Anna T. Jeanes for general museum 

 purjx>ses. The fund will enable us to make much more progress in 

 future in furnishing the new building and in accommodating our 

 rapidly increasing collection. Another improvement in the Mammal 

 department has been the placing on exhibition of the Pacific Walrus 

 obtained by Dr. Sharp and Mr. J. M. Justice. 



In the Archieological Department Mr. Clarence B. ^loore has 

 presented an upright case for the reception of some of the material 

 which he has added to the Moore Collection during the year. Mr. 

 Johnson has continued to devote nuich time to the arrangement of 

 the Isaac Lea Eocene Collection, which has been largely increased 

 during the year through the liberality of the Rev. Dr. L. T. Cham- 

 berlain. This collection now occupies four large double mahogany 

 cases contributed by Dr. Chamberlain, and is undoubtedly the most 

 complete and important series of American Eocene moUusca in 

 existence, while it also contains the largest series in America of 

 Eurojieau Eocene shells. Mr. Johnson has also been engaged to 

 re-arrange the Academy's series of Tertiary Invertebrates. 



In the Botanical rooms a series of nine cases has been erected for 

 the accommodation of the herbarium, which has outgrown its old 

 quarters. 



Temporary cases have also been titted up in the Ornithological 

 room for skins of large birds. Much time has been devoted by the 

 several Conservators to the care of the specimens in their special 

 departments. 



The Curators regret to have to report that much damage was done 

 to furniture and material stored in the basement by the severe flood 

 of August 3rd. The extraordinary rainfall flooded the city sewers 

 and filled the streets to the depth of eighteen inches, from which it 

 forced a way into the cellars and basement. The damage has, how- 




1898,] NATTKAL sciFONCi-s or rHII.APKI.rHIA. 511 



ever, been repaired so far as possiliU', ami tlic actual loss ofsjtocimt'ns 

 seems to be very slight, tlioiigh much time was cDiisunn'tl and ini- 

 portunt museum work seriously hindered. 



Owing to the necessity for removal of ihc publications from the 

 basement i-cveral closets in the now building as well as considerable 

 space on the toj) floor have l)een devoted to their accommodation. 



The additions to the museum (hiring the year have been particu- 

 larly noteworthy as will be seen by reference to the accompanying 

 list. Most important are the valuable collections of Mammals, 

 Birds, Reptiles and Fishes beijueathed to the Academy by the late 

 I'rof. I'Mw. I). Cope, which nund)er about eight thousand specimens 

 and include many of his types. The collection of vertebrate prepara- 

 tions formed Dr. Harrison Allen :uid |pi(scnt(<l by Mrs. Allen is 

 another important accession. v\ valualtlc si'ries of birds from Mon- 

 golia was received from Dr. .\. D. Smith and the Messrs. Ivlward 

 tfe George Farnum, and a number of Japanese j)lant8 and verte- 

 brates from Miss A. Ilarlshorne. An imjjortant colh ction of over 

 300 South Australian inv(M tebrates, maiidy mollusks, has been 

 obtained from Mr. \V. T. Hedmill. TIk; Zoological Society of 

 I'hiladelphia has prcsente<l numerous specimens during the year, 

 which have been prepared in the taxid<!rmical departm<-nt. In the 

 Botanical department the most important addition has been the 

 entire collectifjn of Lichens made by Dr. J. W. Eckfeldt, the well 

 known authority upon this group. 



Another accession of especial importance is a collection (»f Reptiles 

 and Batrachians numbering several hundred specimens, pres.ntt'd by 

 Mr. Arthur K. Brown. 



Kdicient service has been rendered by I lie .jesHiip stiidenls, Messrs.

REPORT ON THE WM. S. VAUX COLLECTIONS. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux Collection begs leave to 

 report that since November 30th, 1896 he has added to it by pur- 

 chase one hundred and twenty-five speciniens. Altlioiigh the 

 number is not as large as in former years, yet the quality of the spec- 

 imens is better, a number of them being species new to the collec- 

 tion including several extra fine large crystals. 



As reported by the Curators several fine new cases were pur- 

 chased during 1897 for the display of the various large specimens 

 which had formerly been exposed. 



The collection now numbers 8,091 specimens all in good order 

 with the exception of two marcasites which have decomposed. 



There have been no additions to the Archaeological Collection 

 since my last report though it continues to attract much attention 

 from visitors. 



Wm. W. Jefferis, 

 Curator. 



REPORT OF THE BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPICAL 



SECTION. 



The Section has held ten meetings during the year. The new 

 room upon the second floor has been partially furnished and the 

 collections placed therein. It is expected that upon the completion 

 of anticipated improvements the accommodations for biological 

 investigations may be made of permanent value to the members and 

 increase the interest of the stated meetings. 



During the year numerous communications have been made, of 

 which the following were presented at the meetings of the Academy: — 



" On the Structure of Diatoms," by Mr. F. J. Keeley. 



" Observations on Errant Frustules of Eunotia major," and 

 " Conjugation of Cloder'nnn ucerosinn," by Mr. T. Ciialkley Palmer. 



" New Species of Diatoms," by Mr. Charles S. Boyer. 



" On Istheinia nervosa in Hudson Strait," by Mr. John A. Shulze. 



" Old and New Microscopes and Methods of Preparation," by Dr. 

 J. Cheston Morris. 



Other communications of interest were made by Dr. Morris, Mr. 

 Holmau and Mr. Woolman.

The Conservator reports the loan to the Section of two microscopes 

 by Dr. Morris, which are of value as modelsof ancient and peculiar 

 construction. Mr. Sliunio presented numerous specimens brought 

 by him from Jamaica.

REPORT OF THE CONCHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



Work on the collection during the i)a.«t year has been confined 

 mainly to the reidentification of the Bulimulidif and other groups 

 monographed in the Manual of Conchology, the rearrangement of 

 part of the fresh-water shells, and the renovation and cataloguing 

 of the alcoholic molhisks. 



The accession."* to the conchological n)U9eum have been important, 

 though no single collection of great .size has been received. A large 

 number of new 8|)ecie8 and species new to thecolluciion having been 

 secured. Aiiditions to our North American serie.s have l)een made 

 by Messrs. J. H. Ferris, R. C. McGregor, E. H. Ashnuin and P. B. 

 Ramlolph, whose collections from the Great Smoky Mountains, 

 nortiiorn California, New Mexico and Ala.>*ka reMj)ectively, are worthy 

 of special meniion among those of llu; large number of naturali.sts 

 who have added to our American series. Dr. II. von Ihering has 

 continued U) send valuabe S(nilh American ci>n?-ignment«, including 

 a large series of alcoholic land .-nail.- from Brazil. The New Zea- 

 land collection received from Mr. H. Suter, and the Australian 

 species from Messrs. W. T. Bednall and J. C. Cox, with a large 

 number of land shells new to the collection, ])urchahed by the Con- 

 chological Section and the Academy, materially augment the series 

 of non-American mollusks.

REPORT OF THE ENTOIMOLOGICAL SECTION. 



This has been a very busy year in the history of the Entomolog- 

 ical Section. The collections have been well cared for with the 

 assistance of Mr. W. J. Gerhard and Mr. Alfred Satterthwaite, 

 and by individual members interested in special branches of entomo- 

 logy. The rearrangement of the American Coleoptera is nearly 

 completed and valuable work has been done on the exotic species by 

 Dr. H. G. Griffith. The unarranged material in the Horn Collec- 

 tion has been placed in safe receptacles preparatory to proper in- 

 corporation in the main collection. Special groups in this collection 

 have been loaned to specialists for study and revision. Many 

 families in the Diptera have been rearranged by Mr. C. W. John- 

 son, in new book boxes purchased for the purpose. Two large 

 boxes of Hemiptera have been purchased, representing a large 

 number of specimens, quite a number of them being new to the 

 collection. The Membracidie have l)een arranged by Mr. Gerhard 

 with the aid of Dr. F. W. Coding, an authority on this subject. 

 The Neuroptera, other than the Odonata, and the Orthoptera have 

 been properly placed in new receptacles by the Conservator. 



Prof James S. Hine has studied and properly identified our 

 material in the genus Bittaeu.i, of which we now have a representa- 

 tive collection. Dr. Calvert has had the care of the Odonata; our 

 collection in this branch is among the very finest in the world. 

 In the Lepidoptera we are indebted to Prof. C. H. Fernald, of Am- 

 herst, Mass. who has studied and revised the Pterophoridse, a very 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 515 



difficult group. The material has been returned in good condition. 

 Mr. Gerhard, with the aid of" the Conservator, has put in fine order 

 the Hesperida? of the world. This is a part of the Martindale col- 

 lection. Much work has also been done on the other families in this 

 fine collection. Mr. Satterthwaite is engaged in rearranging the 

 exotic moths in this collection and has thus far finished the .Sphin- 

 gidie. Fifty new boxes and a fine cabinet have been purchased to 

 contain ihe Hymenoptera and Mr. E. T. Cresson is now engaged in 

 tlieir rearrangement. Mr. Fox has made son)e valuable contribu- 

 tions to science by his studies in this Order. 



Numerous .specimens have been added to the cabinet, the more im- 

 portant donations being a collection of American Coleoptera from 

 Dr. Eckfeldt; 61 specimens of Honduras Lepidoptera by Dr. H. 

 G. Griffith; 68 Hesperidre from Colima, Mexico, from Henry Skin- 

 ner; 124 Beetles, 10 Hemiptera, SOrthoptera, 1 Hymenoptera from 

 Dr. A. D. Smith and the Farnum brothers, all from Manchuria ; 

 9 Coleoptera by W. F, Bediiall, from Australia. 



Many valuable works have been added to the library ; nine 

 hundred and thirty-three have been the gift of the late Dr. Geo. H. 

 Horn. One hundred and seventy works have been bound. Valu- 

 able books have been purcha.-;ed, s<jme of them not being repres- 

 ented in other libraries in this country, the amount e.Kpended being 

 $529.93. The Eittomological News has i)een CDntinutd and the 

 ninth volume completed with 264 i)agesand 12 plates. Tiie i)re8ent 

 space devoted to the Entomological Section is inadequate, owing to 

 its rapid growth in all departments. 



At the annual election held Dec. 22nd. the following persons were 

 elected officers for the year 1899: —

Report of the Conservator. — In presenting this report for the year 

 1898 the Conservator of the Botanical Section wishes to express his 

 appreciation of the aid rendered by the Curators of the Academy in 

 the furnishing of additional cases for the accommodation of the her- 

 barium in the new botanical room on the Library floor formerly 

 occupied by the Entomological Section. 



The.fe cases which were completed in the early part of the year, 

 have rendered necessary the rearrangement of the herbarium, which 

 has been accomplished through the aid of the Director of the Section, 

 Mr. Thomas Meehan. The consolidation of the North American 

 herbarium, formerly kept in the room on the gallery floor, with the 

 general herbarium, will be found to be a great convenience to those 

 making use of the collections. This latter work, which is necessarily 

 slow, will be completed during the present winter. 



The rearrangement of the collections, notwithstanding the addi- 

 tional cases furnished, has made it necessary to remove the speci- 

 mens of vascular Cryptogams to the cases on the gallery floor 

 formerly occupied by the North American Herbarium, the Phanero- 

 gams being disposed of in the cases in the two rooms on the library 

 floor. 



The work of arranging the collections deposited in 1897 by the 

 American Philosophical Society has .satisfactorily progrer^sed, and, it 

 is hoped, will be completed by the end of the coming year. 



The mounting of the general herbarium has been somewhat 

 retarded during the year owing to the enforced absence of the assist- 

 ant in the herbarium, due to illness. 




1898.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF rHILADELPHIA. 517 



The herbarium of the Philadelphia Botanical Club has not hereto- 

 fore been referred to, and I wish, therefore, to here call special 

 attention to the excellent work being done by the members of this 

 organization. 



The plants comprising this collection are from points within a 

 radius of about a hundred miles of the city, including Pennsylvania 

 east from the Susquehanna River and south of the Blue Ridge, all 

 of New Jersey south of the same range of mountains, and the north- 

 ern counties of Delaware and eastern Maryland. 



The lack of specimens of our local plants in the herbarium of the 

 Academy, created the necessity of such a collection, which now 

 numbers many thousand specimens from all sections of the district 

 and it is hoped in time to make it the most complete collection of 

 its kind extant. 



The noteworthy additions to the herbarium during the year 

 have been a collection of Japanese plants presented through Miss A. 

 C. Hart.shorne, a collection of South African plants purchased and 

 pre.sented by Mr. Thonia.< Median, and many plants our own con- 

 tinent presented l)y Messrs. Joseph Crawford, C. F. Saunders and 

 Steward.son Brown.

REPORT OF THE ORNITHOLOGICAL SECTION. 



The work of the Section duriiij;; the past y^J^r has been mainly 

 devoted to the study collection. But little progress has been made in 

 the rearrangement of the exhibition collection of birds owing to the 

 need of cases on the third floor of the new building. 



A synoptical collection has been arranged there, as promised in 

 last year's report, but the main series of mounted birds is still 

 ill the old gallery. Though not displayed to advantage it remains 

 in an excellent state of preservation. 



The study collection has been carefully examined and better pro- 

 vision made for many of the large skins. Most of the Conservator's 

 work this year has been devoted to a study of the types in the collec- 

 tion which have been carefully identified and arranged in .special 

 cases, the results of this work having been embodied in a paper 

 which will appear in the Proceedings. 



The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club has made many addi- 

 tions to the collection presented by it to the Academy so that it is 

 now probably the most complete exhibition of its kind in existence. 

 The meetings of the Club continue to be held at the Academy and 

 do much to stimulate ornithological study. 



The Section is also much gratified to l)e able to report that through 

 its eflTorts the annual meeting of the American Ornithologists' 

 Union will be held at the Academy in Nov., 1899. The importance 

 of this meeting to local ornithologists and to the Academy will be 

 readily understood. 



During the year the most important accession has been the collec- 

 tion of bird skins bequeathed by the late Prof E. D. Co{)e number- 

 ing nearly 1,000 specimens and containing the once famous collec- 

 tion ofC.S. Turnbull. 



Of great importance also is a small series of specimens from Man- 

 churia received from Dr. A. Donaldson Smith and the Messrs. Far- 

 num. Valuable specimens were also received from the Zoological 

 Society of Philadelphia, Dr. J. E. Roraig and others. . 



The magnificient collection of North American land birds formed 

 by Mr. Josiah Hoopes has been received on deposit. 



At the annual meeting held Dec. 19, 1898, the following officers 

 were elected : — 



Director, ...... Spencer Trotter. 



Vice-Director, Geo. S. Morris.
