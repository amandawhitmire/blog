Permission being granted, the Report of the Biological Department 

 for December was read and ordered to be printed with the Proceed- 

 ings of. the month. 



Mr. Lea, in referring to the death of Augustus E. Jessup, one of our old 

 members, mentioned that the deceased was elected in 1818, and that 

 he had been an ardent student of mineralogy and a most persevering 

 collector, being in the habit of visiting on foot and collecting largely from dis- 

 tant localities. In 1819 he accompanied Major Long's expedition to the Rocky 

 Mountains as mineralogist and geologist, and handed in his report to the Depart- 

 ment, but for some reason, unknown at present, it was not#inserted in the 

 Journal of that Expedition as published. Having entered into an active busi- 

 ness career, in which he was eminently successful, he retired in the year 

 1853 with an ample fortune, having made many friends by his probity, punc- 

 tuality and liberality. He was frank and open in his manners, prompt and 

 just in his dealings and liberal in his views. While immersed in the cares of 

 a large business, he did not forget his early attachment to the Academy. He 

 was unable, from his residence being at some distance, to attend the meetings, 

 but he watched with pleasure the growth and usefulness of our institution, 

 and was always ready to contribute liberally to promote the objects of Natural 

 History. He died suddenly, on the 17th day of December, 1859, at his resi- 

 dence in Wilmington, Del., in his 63d year. 



In conclusion Mr. Lea offered the following resolutions : 



Resolved, That in the decease of our fellow member, Augustus E. Jessup, we 

 have lost an old, esteemed and valued associate, who, through a long and sue- 



I860.] 1 




& PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



cessful career had not ceased to promote the objects, which, in early life, at- 

 tached him to the study of Natural History. 



Resolved, That while the members are sensible of the loss they have sus- 

 tained, they are not forgetful of the sorrows of his afflicted family, to whom 

 they offer their condolence. 



Which were adopted.

Mr. Lea, President in the Chair. 



Forty-nine members present. 



Tiie following papers were presented for publication : 



" Appendix to the paper entitled New Genera and Species of North 

 American Tipulidse with short palpi," by R. Osten Sacken. 



" Contributions to American Lepidopterology, No. 3,"by Brackenridge 

 Clemens, M. D. 



Mr. Lea having stated some facts in relation to the history of Anthra- 

 cite, Dr. Pickering mentioned that Mr. Shoemaker's first load of An- 

 thracite was taken to the factory of Mr. Samuel Wetherill, at the cor- 

 ner of 12th and Cherry streets, but in consequence of the impossibility 

 of burning it, it was buried. 



Permission being granted, the following resolutions were passed, in 

 relation to the application made this evening by Dr. Evans, for the co- 

 operation of the Academy, in his efforts to transport the meteorite now 

 lying near Port Orford, W. T. 



Resolved, That the Academy will cheerfully co-operate with Dr. 

 Evans in his endeavors to rescue for science the meteorite of Washing- 

 ton Territory. 



Resolved, That a Committee of three be appointed to prepare a 

 memorial in such form as may, in their opinion, conduce to the carrying 

 out of the views of Dr. Evans, a draft of the same to be reported at the 

 next meeting. 



The death of Peter A. Browne, late a member of the Academy, at 

 Philadelphia, on the 9th instant, was announced.

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



Forty members present. 



A paper entitled the Mexican Humming Birds, No. 1, by Rafael 

 Montes de Oca was presented for publication. 



Mr. Lea exhibited some specimens of Unionida?., and remarked that he had 

 often been asked as to the number of species which inhabited the United 

 States, a question he could not answer, as he had never made a separate cata- 

 logue of such species. Recently he had been requested by the Secretary of the 

 Smithsonian Institution to furnish a list for publication by that Institution, 

 which he had just finished and sent to Washington. In making the list he 

 had used the manuscript which he had prepared for a new and enlarged edi- 

 tion (4) of his " Synopsis. " From the list he had carefully eliminated the 

 synonyms, and there remained in it the extraordinarily large number of 

 five hundred and twenty species which have been described, inhabiting the 

 Rivers, Lakes and Pools of the United States and Territories, and he stated 

 that he had some 30 to 40 in his possession not yet named or described. 

 These 520 may be thus divided : 



Unio, ......... 441 species. 



Margaritana, ....... 26 do. 



Anodonta, ........ 53 do. 



520 

 New species in Mr. Lea's possession, but yet not described, 30 



550 

 Mr. Lea further remarked that it was very probable that at least 100 more 

 species would be added to this list, as inhabiting within the present limits of 

 the United States, as almost every naturalist, searching in unexplored waters, 

 was constantly discovering new forms. In reflecting on the profusion of this 

 kind of animal life in the United States, the naturalist is astonished at the 

 great number of forms characteristic of the various species, and he is the more 

 struck with the extent of it, when a comparison is made with the small num- 

 ber of species which inhabit the continent of Europe, there not being in the 

 fresh waters of that quarter of the globe more perhaps than ten species, viz: 

 seven Uniones, one Margaritana, one Monocondylcca, and one Anodonta. Mr. 

 Lea stated that he had taken great pains to procure specimens from all parts 

 of Europe, and he was satisfied that there were 98 synonyms made by Euro- 

 pean authors, for the single species of Anodonta cygnea, Draparnaud, the 

 Mytilus cygneus of Linnaeus, and the synonymy is nearly as profusely erroneous, 

 in Unio pictorum, Unio tumidus, Unio Batavus and Unio littoral is. 



Mr. Slack remarked, in connection with the bones presented this evening, 

 that they were discovered some two weeks since by Mr. O. C. Herbert, in his 

 marl pits, near Marlborough, Monmouth Co., N. J., at a depth of twenty-five 

 feet beneath the surface. Having received information of their discovery from 

 Mr. Hopper, of Freehold, on Monday week, Mr. S. visited the pits and pro- 

 cured the specimens from Mr. H. They consist of fragments of the femur 

 and fibula of the Mosasaurus, and are of great interest, the long bones of this 

 reptile having until recently been unknown. 



On motion of Mr. Slack, the thanks of the Academy were ordered 

 to be tendered to Messrs. J. M. Hopper and O. C. Herbert, of Mon- 

 mouth Co., N. J., and also to Mr. Edward L. Perkins, for donations 

 presented by them.

Jan. %\st. 

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 



Forty-four members present. 



The report of the Biological Department for the present month was 

 read. 



On report of a Committee of the Biological Department, the paper en- 

 titled " Remarks on errors in the Anatomical Diagnosis of Cancer, by 

 J. J. Woodward, M. D.," was recommended for publication in a Medical 

 Journal. 



On report of the respective Committees the following papers were 

 ordered to be published in the Journal of the Academy : 



" Reflections upon the nature of the temporary star of the year 1572, 

 an application of the Nebular Hypothesis, by Alexander Wilcox, M. D." 



" Descriptions of New Cretaceous and Eocene Shells of Mississippi 

 and Alabama, also with notes on Eocene fossil shells, by T. A. Conrad." 



" Descriptions of new species of Fossils, probably Triassic, from Vir- 

 ginia, by W. M. Gabb." 



" Descriptions of new species of Cretaceous fossils, by W. M. Gabb." 



" Additional new species of Fossils to a paper by T. A. Conrad." 



And the following in the Proceedings : 



Contributions to American Lepidopterology. No. 3. 



BY BRACKENRIDGE CLEMENS, M. D. 



TltfEINA. 



The plan of these papers will hereafter be changed, and no diagnosis 

 of genera will be given, except when there is doubt respecting the identity of 

 the European and American groups, and when the genera are new. The in- 

 tention of giving some conception of the systematic arrangement of the group 

 Tineina will therefore be abandoned, and the subsequent papers be confined 

 simply to the description of species. I find myself compelled to adopt this 

 course, in consequence of perceiving, as I advance in the recognition of generic 

 groups, that the diagnoses of the families heretofore cited are too limited, and 

 that, in order to represent my conception of these groups, I shall be obliged 

 to make them more comprehensive. These changes, together with generic 

 synopses of the families, will be best treated in a monograph of the Tineina, 

 which will be undertaken as soon as the collection of the writer represents, 

 with some degree of completeness, the genera found in our country. In order 

 that the accomplishment of this may not be too long delayed, contributions of 

 specimens are respectfully solicited from collectors, either in accordance with 

 the call from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in the Report for 

 1858, or the request made at the present time. Contributions may be sent to 

 the Smithsonian Institution, or to myself, but, in the latter case, the charges 

 for carriage must be prepaid ; and should the contributor desire it, a suite of 

 named specimens will be returned to him. Full directions for the collection 

 and preservation of Lepidoptera are contained in the Smithsonian Report for 

 1858, and may be had on application to the Secretary of the Institution.

Or. strigifinitella . Labial palpi yellowish white, dotted with dark 

 brown, and with two dark brown rings before the tip. Head and antennae 

 dull yellow. Fore wings brownish gray suffused with dark brown, with the 

 inner margin, from near the base to the middle, varied with white and dark 

 brown ; on the middle of costa a white streak, and a few small, costal, dark 

 brown blotches. Near the tip, on the inner margin, a slender, very oblique 

 white streak, dark margined on both sides, which crosses an oblique streak of 

 the same hue from the costa, likewise dark-margined on both sides above the 

 streak from the inner margin, and curved beneath, forming a white hinder- 

 marginal line in the cilia, beneath the tip, and extending nearly to the apex 

 of the wing. Beyond these, toward the base, in the apical third of the wing, 

 are two oblique, dark brown costal streaks, with a short, white one between 

 them, the first irregular and somewhat diffused, the second margined behind 

 with brownish yellow. Apical portion of the wing dark brown. Hind wings 

 dark brown ; cilia somewhat paler.

 head and face faintly tinged with pale golden brown. Antennae silvery, annu- 

 lated with dark brown. Fore wings silvery white, with a pale golden brown 

 streak at the base of the costa. About the middle of the wing is an oblique, 

 dark golden brown band, broadest on the inner margin, and tapering to the 

 costa, beyond which is a narrower, oblique band of the same hue produced in 

 the middle, as a rather broad, somewhat curved streak toward the tip, behind 

 which it is arrested ; cilia pale golden brown, with a darker hinder-marginal 

 line ; hind wings dark gray ; cilia the same. 



Another specimen, on the middle of the inner margin, has a rectangular, 

 golden brown patch, not extended to the costa, with an irregular, obliquely 

 placed patch of the same hue on the inner margin, near the tip, and slightly 

 connected with a small costal patch placed midway between the patches, on 

 the inner margin. The tip of the wing is golden brown, and is scarcely con- 

 nected With the second patch by a posteriorly produced portion. 



Taken on wing, June, July. 



Ornix Zeller. 



0. trepidella . Labial palpi yellowish white, annulated with dark brown 

 near the tip. Head dark brown. Antennae dark brown, slightly annulated

brown scales, with the cilia of extreme apex white ; cilia grayish, with dark 

 brown tipped scales intermixed. Hind wings pale gray ; cilia similar. Ab- 

 domen blackish, tipped with yellowish ochreous. 



0. C ratfegif oliella. Labial palpi whitish. Head dark brown and 

 gray intermixed. Antennae dark brown, faintly annulated with whitish. 

 Fore wings dark brown, with a purplish hue. Along the inner margin, from 

 the base to the anal angle, whitish, dusted with dark brownish. In the fold 

 at the base is a dark brown streak, and a small blotch of the same hue be- 

 yond the middle, nearly reaching to the inner margin. Toward the tip are a 

 few whitish, costal streaks, and at the apex a small, round, dark brown spot, 

 in a whitish patch, with a circular, dark brown apical line behind it ; cilia 

 blackish gray. Hind wings blackish gray ; cilia rather paler. Abdomen 

 blackish, tipped with dull yellow. 



The larva mines the leaves of Crataegus tomentosa (Black Thorn), in 

 September, and becomes a pupa early in October, weaving a reddish brown 

 cocoon in a turned down edge of the leaf. The pupa case is thrust from the 

 end of* the cocoon at maturity, the imago appearing early in May. There is, 

 doubtless, a summer brood, but I have not sought for it. The head of the 

 larva is brown ; the body greenish white, with the dorsum reddish brown. 



Hyponomeuta Zeller. 



H. multipunc t ella . Labial palpi, head, antennae and thorax, white. 

 Thorax with a black spot on the front of tegulae, and a few spots of the same 

 hue on the disk. Fore wings white, with the costa at the base blackish, and 

 longitudinal rows of distinct black dots ; two of which, one along the inner 

 margin and one along the fold, are very plain. Hind wings blackish gray. 



Bedellia ? Stainton. 



This genus is represented by a single species, in Europe. It was, therefore, 

 a surprise to myself, when I found the species described below, corresponded 

 to the European not only in structure but in ornamentation. There is, how- 

 ever, a slight difference in the neuration of the posterior wings of the two in- 

 sects when compared with Mr. Stainton's delineation, and hence I give a full 

 generic diagnosis of the American species. 



The anterior wings are narrow and pointed, and the posterior very narrow, 

 almost setiform. The discoidal cell of the anterior is acute behind, with three 

 subcosto-marginal nervules, the last of which arises at the apex of the cell, 

 together with the apical nervule, which sends off, at about its middle, a ner- 

 vulet to the inner margin, and is furcate near the tip of the wing. The median 

 nervure sends only a single branch to the inner margin. Both the costal and 

 sub-median nervures are short. The posterior wings without discoidal cell ; 

 the costal nervure is very short ; the sub-costal runs through the middle of 

 the wing, and sends a branch to the inner margin, rather beyond the middle, 

 and is furcate at its extremity, the lower branch proceeding to the tip, along 

 the inner margin. Above the subcostal nervure is a rather indistinct, paral- 

 lel fold. The median nervure is long, well marked, and simple ; placed near 

 the inner margin of the wing. 



Head rough above, and in front, between the antenna?, almost tufted ; face 

 smooth, moderately broad, and rounded. Ocelli none. Eyes moderately 

 prominent, round, and partially covered with hairs from above. Antennae as 

 long as the anterior wings, filiform, simple ; basal joint squamose. No max- 

 illary palpi. Labial palpi very short, pointed, and rather porrected, with two 

 joints only distinguishable. Tongue naked and short. 



B. ? Staintoniella . Labial palpi and head ochreous, the latter some- 

 what reddish ochreous above. Antennae oclu-eous. Fore wings ochreous, 

 dusted with dark fuscouSj but leaving a streak of the general hue along the 



[Jan.

inner margin. Hind wings dark gray ; cilia rather dark ochreous. Abdomen 

 dark brown and ochreous mixed. 



Cosmiotes. 



Fore wings rather narrowly ovate-lanceolate, with the discoidal cell closed 

 acutely. The sub-costal nervure is attenuated toward base of the wing, and 

 subdivides into three marginal branches, the first of which arises at about 

 its middle, and sends from the angle of the disk a trijid branch, which is 

 either forked on the costa by an exceeding short branch before the tip, and 

 gives rise at about its middle to a branch to the inner margin, or is trifid at 

 its extreme tip. The median is two or three-branched near its end. The 

 sub-median is simple. Hind wings are without a discoidal cell ; and the 

 costal nervure is moderately long. The sub-costal runs through the^ mid- 

 dle of the wing, (is central), and is furcate near the tip. The median is 

 well indicated, with two or three short, approximated branches about the mid- 

 dle of the inner margin. 



Size very small. Head smooth. Without ocelli. Forehead rather elevated 

 and rounded ; face rounded, and nearly equally broad. Eyes very small, 

 oval, and somewhat sunken, scarcely visible in front. Labial palpi- mode- 

 rately long and slender, smooth, pointed, and somewhat recurved ; the second 

 joint slightly compressed laterally. No maxillary palpi. Antennae inserted 

 laterally ; basal joint short and rather thick, with a few cilia at the base be- 

 fore ; stalk simple, slender, and scarcely as long as the body. Tongue naked, 

 and about as long as the labial palpi. 



Median vein of hind ivings two-branched. Apical vein trifid at the tip. 



C. illectella. Labial palpi and head yellowish brown. Anteunse fus- 

 cous. Fore wings fuscous, dusted with dark brown, with a broad, transverse 

 silvery white band near the middle of the wing, a spot of the same hue on 

 the costa near the tip, and an opposite one on the inner margin, nearly join- 

 ing it in the middle of the wing. The extreme apex of the wing has a silvery 

 streak in the cilia, margined behind with a row of dark brown atoms on their 

 ends. Hind wings grayish fuscous ; cilia the same. 



Median vein of hind icing three-branched. Apical vein forked on the costa, 

 with a nervulet to the inner margin. 



C. maculoscella. Labial palpi dull yellowish. Head dark brownish. 

 Antenna? fuscous. Fore wings shining silvery grayish, suffused with dark 

 golden brown, with a rather obscure silvery band in the middle of the wing 

 and a silvery spot on the costa just before the tip. The extreme apical por- 

 tion of the wing is blackish brown ; cilia grayish brown. Hind wings grayish, 

 dusted with dark brown ; cilia grayish brown. 



Medio-posterior and central veins opposite the space between the second and 

 third sub-costo marginals. 



C. madarella . Head dark silvery gray. Antennae dark brown, yellow- 

 ish white at the tips. Fore wings dark golden brown, silvery gray at the 

 base, with an oblique, pale golden band near the middle of the wing, the 

 costal portion being nearest the base. On the costa, near the tip, is a pale 

 golden spot, with a spot of the same hue opposite on the inner margin, and 

 one in the middle of the wing before the tip ; cilia pale brown, dotted with 

 dark brown. Hind wings grayish brown ; cilia rather darker. 



Cosmoptekyx ? Hiibner. 



The anterior wings are rather narrow, and slenderly caudate. The discoidal 

 cell is elongate and very narrow, and closed acutely behind with three sub- 

 costo-marginal nervules, the first arising about the middle of the wing. The 

 median sendsybwr nervules to the inner margin, the first arising midway be-

tween the first and second subcostal branches, and the last from the apex of 

 the discoidal cell, together with an apical branch, which almost immediately 

 sends off a nervulet to the inner margin, whilst the apical proceeds through 

 the middle of the slender, acicular caudate extremity to its tip. At the basal 

 third of the wing, the sub-costal nervure becomes attenuated. The costal is 

 nearly coincident with the margin ; the sub-median furcate at the base. The 

 posterior wings are narrow, almost setiform, and without a discoidal cell. 

 The sub-median is central, simple, and faintly indicated until near the tip, 

 when it becomes furcate. The median, which is better defined, runs near the 

 inner margin, and subdivides into three branches to the inner margin. The 

 costal is coincident with the marginal. 



Head perfectly smooth, advanced, long, and flattened above ; forehead very 

 convex and globose ; face full, rounded, and somewhat retreating. Ocelli 

 none. Eyes flattened, scarcely visible in front, oval. Antenna? nearly as 

 long as the anterior wings ; basal joint long, slender, and clavate ; stalk seta- 

 ceous and simple. Maxillary palpi extremely short, scarcely perceptible. Labial 

 palpi very long, slender, much recurved, and pointed ; the second joint some- 

 what compressed toward the end, shorter than the third. Tongue scaled, as 

 long as the thorax beneath. 



C. ? gem mif erella . Labial palpi dark greenish brown, with a silvery 

 stripe on the front of the third joint, and another behind, continued to the 

 second joint. Face, head, and thorax, dark greenish brown, with a narrow, 

 central, silvery line continued to the thorax, and one of the same hue above 

 the eyes on each side. Antennae dark greenish brown, with two silvery lines 

 on the basal joint, the stalk annulated with silvery, and a broad, silvery ring 

 before the tip, which is likewise silvery. Fore wings dark greenish brown to 

 the middle, and from the apical third to the tip, with an orange-colored patch 

 rather beyond the middle of the wing, extended across the wing, and a little 

 produced along the costa behind, having a large, transverse, oval, smooth 

 patch of elevated, silvery scales somewhat violet-hued, on its internal margin 

 the patch extending nearly across the wing ; another smaller and similar, 

 nearly round one behind it, on the inner margin, and another small one on 

 the costa, behind the produced portion, with a white costal streak above it in 

 the cilia. All these patches are somewhat black-margined. Near the base of 

 the wing are three short, silvery streaks, one nearly on the disk, one near the 

 fold beneath it, and an oblique one above it, near the costa. The cilia of the 

 extreme apex is silvery white, black-margined above, with a violet silvery 

 scale in the middle of the wing, before the tip. The inner margin, at the base 

 of the wing, is silvery. Hind wings dark brown ; cilia somewhat paler. 



The ornamentation of this insect is very elegant. Taken on wing in June, 

 July. 



EUDARCIA. 



Head and face rough. Without ocelli. Eyes small, hemispherical quite 

 prominent, with a naked space above ? Labial palpi short, rather smooth, 

 and separated ; the third joint somewhat less thick than the second, and 

 nearly as long. Maxillary palpi long, folded, and five or six-jointed. An- 

 tennae, basal joint moderately long, approximated on the front, simple, and 

 full as long as the anterior wings. Tongue naked and very short, scarcely as 

 long as the labial palpi, and not reaching beyond the front. 



Fore wings with the subcostal nervure attenuated at the base ; at the basal 

 third arises a long marginal branch, and about its middle a furcate branch, 

 and thence the subcostal is faintly indicated to the discal nervure, beyond 

 which it reappears as a furcate branch to the costa behind the tip. The dis- 

 coidal cell is closed, and sends a single branch to the inner margin behind 

 the tip. The median subdivides into three approximate branches. The sub- 

 median is furcate at the base. In the hind wing the costal nervure is 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



rather long and distinct ; subcostal simple, and obsolete from the middle to 

 the base ; discoidal cell unclosed, with an independent discal nervule, faintly 

 indicated from the base, and furcate at the apical third. The median strongly 

 indicated and bifid rather beyond the middle of the inner margin. 



E. s imu 1 atr ic el la . Head brownish ochreous. Antennae ochreous, 

 annulated with dark brown. Fore wings dark brownish, with a white band 

 about the basal third of the wing, a white spot on the costa, near the middle, 

 and one on the inner margin, a little behind it, and a white transverse streak 

 near the tip. Hind wings dark brown ; cilia the same. 



This insect has considerable resemblance to an Incurvaria. Its neuration, 

 however, places it in a very distinct group. 



Antispila Herrich-Schaffer, Frey. 



A. Ny saef o 1 i ella . Head above dark brown. Face, labial palpi, and 

 fore feet shining yellowish ochreous. Antennae dark brown ; basal joint yellowish 

 ochreous. Fore wings dark brown, with a greenish reflection, and the base 

 with a bright coppery hue. Near the base is a rather broad, bright golden 

 band, broadest on the inner margin, where it is nearest the base, and con- 

 stricted at the fold of the wing ; a spot of the same hue on the costa, at the 

 apical third of the wing, and one on the inner margin, midway between this 

 and the band ; cilia somewhat coppery, and rather grayish at the inner angle. 

 Hind wings purple brown ; cilia grayish ochreous. 



The larva mines the leaves of Nysa multiflorain September. The head 

 is dark brown ; first segment dark brownish ; body very pale green with dark 

 atoms along the dorsum ; ventral surface with a line of two black spots. After 

 the last molting the first segment is black, and the dorsal spots become a 

 black, vascular line. When full fed, the larva weaves an oval cocoon within 

 the mine, and cutting the two skins of the leaf into a correspondent form, 

 permits it to fall to the ground. There is thus left an oval hole in the de- 

 serted mine. The imagos appear during the following May. 



A. co r n if oliella . Head, face, labial palpi, and fore feet dark brown. 

 Antennae dark brown ; basal joint somewhat ochreous. fore wings rather 

 dull dark brown, with a coppery hue. Near the base is a rather narrow, 

 golden band, not constricted on the fold, and rather indistinct toward the costa, 

 where it is somewhat suffused with a coppery hue, and nearest the base on the 

 inner margin. At the apical third of the wing is a small golden spot, and 

 nearly opposite, on the inner margin, another of the same hue, with the 

 hinder portion of the wing tinged with a bright reddish coppery hue ; cilia 

 dark grayish. Hind wings purplish brown ; cilia somewhat paler, with a cop- 

 pery hue. 



The larva mines the leaves of Cornus florida, in September. It'may pos- 

 sibly be a variation of Nysaefoliella. The larvae of the insects are very 

 like each other, but I don't know whether that ofCornifoliella undergoes 

 the same change of coloration after the last molting as that of Nysaefoli- 

 ella. The head and shield dark brown ; body nearly white, with seven 

 minute, black points along the dorsum, and eight on the ventral surface, 

 somewhat larger, and more distinct. Its mode of preparing for pupation is 

 the same as the previous species, but whilst the individuals of Nysaefoli- 

 e 1 1 a on a single tree are almost innumerable, those ofCornifoliella are 

 not abundant. 



Aspidisca. 



Fore wings with no discoidal cell. The subcostal nervure traverses the 

 middle of the wing, attenuated from the base to the basal third, where it gives 

 origin to a long, marginal branch, which reaches the costa at the apical third 

 of the wing ; near the tip it subdivides into three short branches, one of which 

 is delivered to the costa behind the tip, one to the tip, without attaining the

extreme apes, and one to the inner margin, somewhat behind the second 

 marginal branch. The median nervure is wanting. The sub-median simple. 

 Hind wings with no discoidal cell. The subcostal nervure is central and 

 attenuated towards the base, and at about its apical third delivers a 

 branch to the inner margin, and is bifid behind the tip of the wing. The 

 median is simple. The submedian obsolete or wanting. 



Size extremely small. Head and face smooth, covered with closely ap- 

 pressed scales. Face rather broad, and somewhat produced beneath into a 

 point. Forehead rounded. Ocelli none. Eyes extremely small, not visible 

 from above, and scarcely visible in front. Antennae held extended at the 

 sides, very short, scarcely one-half & long as the anterior wings, rather thick, 

 obtuse, and rougheired with scales. Maxillary palpi none. Labial palpi 

 none. Tongue none. 



A. splendorif er ella . Head golden. Antennas fuscous, tinged with 

 golden. Fore wings, from the base to the middle, leaden gray, with a splen- 

 dent lustre, and from the middle to the tip golden, with a broad, nearly 

 straight, metallic, silvery streak, extending from the costa near the tip to 

 the middle of the wing, and dark-margined on both sides. This is nearly 

 joined by a dorsal streak of the same hue, almost opposite to it, with con- 

 verging dark margins, and with a blotch of dark brown scales adjoining it be- 

 hind. In the costo-apical cilia is a short, blackish brown streak, parallel to 

 the dark margin of the silvery costal streak. 



At the tip is a black, apical spot, with metallic, silvery scales in its centre, 

 and a few silvery scales in the cilia above and beneath it. A blackish brown 

 hinder marginal line in the cilia, interrupted by a silvery streak in the cilia 

 beneath the apical spot, and the cilia yellowish brown. Hind wings leaden 

 gray ; cilia yellowish brown. 



The larva mines the leaves of Crataegus tomentosa early in September. 

 The mine appears at first as a very narrow line, and is subsequently expanded 

 into a small, transparent blotch. At maturity, the larva weaves a cocoon 

 between the cuticles, and cuts a small oval disk. This is sometimes carried 

 quite a distance, and is ultimately secured to some object by one of its ends 

 tied down on a little button of white silk. It enters the pupa state toward 

 the latter part of September, and appears as an imago early in spring. 



The mature larva has a head much smaller than the first ring, rounded 

 above, and elliptical. The body is flattened, and tapers posteriorly from the 

 anterior rings. The segments are rather deeply incised, the thoracic ob- 

 tusely rounded at the sides, and the rest with a minute lateral nodule or 

 mammilla. It is without legs or prolegs, but on the second and third thoracic 

 rings, on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces, are spots or cup-like depres- 

 sions, one, on each side, capable of being contracted and expanded. So, like- 

 wise, from the sixth to the ninth inclusive, on the ventral surface are 

 transversely placed oval spots, similar to the thoracic, and one on each seg- 

 ment. On the segment next the last is a protuberance, both dorsal and ven- 

 tral, with two cup-like depressions on each surface. These are not supplied 

 with hooks, and if they are substitutes for feet, must act like suckers. They 

 are all pale brown. The head is dark brown ; the body brown, with blackish 

 along the dorsal and ventral surfaces. 



"When the larvae are young, it is extremely difficult to discover their mines, 

 and the transparent blotch is not much larger than the cocoon, leaving a space 

 in which the ' ' frass ' ' is collected. 



Diachorisia. 



Fore wings pointed, narrowly ovate- lanceolate ; discoidal cell closed behind 

 by a very faintly indicated nervure, with a faintly indicated secondary cell. 

 The subcostal nervure obscurely indicated from the secondary cell to the base 

 of the wing, with a long and distinct marginal nervule from near the base, 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



one from the middle of the secondary cell, and three from the end of it to the 

 costa. Three nervules from the discal nervure to the inner margin, heneath 

 the tip. The median without branches ; beyond the discal, it proceeds to the 

 inner margin, as a 9ingle short vein ; perhaps it may be bifid. The submedian 

 is simple. Hind wings lanceolate, clothed with scales, with the discoidal 

 cell closed by a very faintly indicated nervure. The costal nervure is long, 

 and extends nearly to the tip of the wing. The subcostal is simple, and. 

 wanting from near the origin of the discal nervure, where it is slightly pro- 

 duced inwardly, but well indicated thence to near the tip. The discal ner- 

 vure gives rise to a discal branch which quickly becomes bifid, and its 

 branches well defined near to the tip, above and beneath. The median is 

 well indicated, and is three-branched, the last very faintly connected with 

 the second. No submedian nervure. 



Size very small. Head rough and hairy above and in front. Ocelli none. 

 Eyes rather large, round, and salient, not set on a naked circular portion of 

 the head, nor with a naked space above the eyes. Antennse about one-half 

 as long as the anterior wings, inserted laterally, and microscopically pubes- 

 cent beneath ; basal joint moderately long, stalk roughened with scales. 

 Maxillary palpi rather long and folded. Labial palpi moderate, slender, 

 smooth, cylindrical, separated, and somewhat drooping ; the third joint nearly 

 as long as the second, which has a few bristles at its end and beneath. 

 Tongue ?. 



D. velatella . Labial palpi dark brownish. Head brownish gray. An- 

 tennse grayish fuscous, with the basal joint whitish, having a blackish, ex- 

 ternal streak. Fore wings whitish, dusted with dark fuscous, with a few 

 dark fuscous spots along the costa, and one of the same hue about the 

 middle of the disk, beneath which, on the fold, is another of the same hue. 

 Toward the apex, in the middle of the wing, beneath the last costal spot, is a 

 small, dark fuscous spot, sometimes connected toward the base of the wing 

 with a dusted streak of the same hue; cilia whitish, somewhat dotted with 

 dark fuscous. Hind wings grayish brown ; cilia the same. 



The relationship of this insect tolncurvaria and its allied genera, espe- 

 cially to Acerifoliella and toEudarcia, is very obvious. 



Bucculatrix? Hiibner. 



The anterior wings lanceolate ; the discal cell is closed acutely behind, with 

 the subcostal nervure faintly indicated from the middle of the wing to the base, 

 and sending/owr nervules to the costa, the first about the basal third, and its 

 origin from the subcostal faintly indicated ; the three others arising near the 

 apical portion of the wing, with the subcostal between the second and last rather 

 faintly indicated ; the third nervule scarcely noticeable, and the last branch 

 arising from the apex of the discoidal cell. The median is strongly indicated 

 throughout, and sends off to the inner margin at its posterior end, a very 

 faintly indicated branch, whilst the apical branch, which appears to be a con- 

 tinuation of it, becomes bifid behind the tip of the wing. The posterior are 

 narrowly lanceolate, without discoidal cell. The subcostal nervure is central, 

 and subdivides beyond the middle of the wing into three branches, two to the 

 inner margin, and one along the exterior margin to the tip. The median ner- 

 vure is simple. 



Size extremely small. Head rough, tufted in the middle. Face smooth and 

 retreating. Eyes salient, visible in front. Antennse with a spreading, basal 

 eye-cap, expanded above the eyes ; stalk very slender, simple, scarcely more 

 than one-half so long as the body. No labial or maxillary palpi. Tongue 

 naked, very short, not one-half as long as the anterior coxae. 



B. ? coronatella. Face yellowish-white. The head with the tuft pale 

 orange chrome ; the eye-caps pale yellow, touched behind with orange chrome. 

 Antennse yellow, dotted above with dark brown. Fore wings pale orange

chrome, with a whitish patch near the base above the fold, one nearly oppo- 

 site, on the inner margin, and one about the middle of the wing, on the costa. 

 Near the tip of the wing is a rather indistinct, narrow, whitish band, becoming 

 somewhat diffuse on the inner margin, about the middle of the cilia ; extreme 

 apex of the wing whitish, mixed with scales of the general hue: cilia grayish 

 fulvous. Hind wings dark gray ; cilia fulvous gray. Abdomen pale orange 

 chrome, with a dark brownish stripe along the dorsum, varied with fulvous. 



PYRAL1DINA. Fam. HERMINID^E. 

 Epipaschia. 



Anterior wings with two approximated, subcosto-marginal nervules arising 

 near tb^e end of the disk, with a short nervulet to the costa, from near the tip 

 of the subcosto-apical nervule ; the origin of the post apical is midway between 

 the discal and marginal nervulet; the subcosto-inferior and discal have coinci- 

 dent origins. The discal is nearly circularly curved, and is continued to the 

 disco-central nervule which anastomoses by contact with the medio-superior. 

 Median three-branched. Submedian furcate at the base. In the posterior 

 wings the discal nervure is long, with a sweeping curve, and, as in the anterior 

 wings, is continued to the disco-central nervule, anastomosing by contact with 

 the medio-superior. 



Head with ocelli. Eyes round, rather large and salient. Maxillary palpi 

 short, scaly and porrected. Labial palpi smooth, recurved, but not exceeding 

 the vertex, cylindrical and pointed; third joint rather short, and indistinctly 

 marked. Tongue scaled at the base, and nearly as long as the thorax beneath. 

 Antennae with an arlicitlated appendage arising from the basal joint, throicn back- 

 wards, and as long as the thorax, and clothed with scales and spreading hairs at its 

 tip; the stalk is exterior to it, slender, its joints roughened with scales, and 

 finely ciliated beneath. 



E. supera tali s. Head yellowish. Labial palpi yellowish, dusted with 

 dark ochreous, with a dark brown spot at the base of the third joint. An- 

 tennas brownish, annulated with yellow, the antennal appendage yellow, dusted 

 with blackish brown, especially exteriorly. Fore wings pale yellowish, dusted 

 with dark brownish to an irregular dark brown line, crossing the nervules from 

 the costa to the inner margin, beyond which it is dull reddish brown. About 

 the middle of the costa is a blackish brown spot, a small one of the same hue 

 on the discal nervure; a minute one at the base, and the base of the fold, with 

 the inner margin at the base tinted with reddish brown. On the posterior 

 margin of the wing is a line of dark brown dots. Hind wings fuscous, with a 

 dark brown round spot near the exterior margin of the base, and a brownish 

 marginal line, with one of the same hue in the cilia.

Appendix to the paper entitled New Genera and Species of North American 



Tipulidae with short palpi, &c. 



BY R. OSTEN SACKEN. 



The following are some additions and corrections to my paper, suggested by 

 the examination of the entomological collections of the British Museum, the 

 Jardin des Plantes, and the Museum of the University of Berlin, as well as of 

 some private collections. 



The British Museum afforded me the desired information about the Lim- 

 n o b i ae described by Mr. Walker in his " List of Specimens, etc." 



L. simulans Walk, is my Dicranomyia defuncta. Mr. Walker, (1. c. 

 p. 45) describes this species as "pale yellow, legs yellow, tips of the thighs, of the 

 shanks, and of the feet, black, " etc.; whereas, in reality, the body is cinereous, the 

 legs are dark brown, almost black, with a whitish ring before the tip of the femora, 

 etc. Mr. Walker's description was drawn from a single old and faded speci- 

 men ; no wonder, therefore, that it could not be identified. 



L. badia Walk, seems to be my Dicranomyia humidicola. The only 

 specimen in the British Museum is without leg9. The characteristic mark of 

 the species, the white ring at the tip of the tibice, was therefore not mentioned in 

 the description. (Walker, 1. c. p. 46.) 



Anisomera longicornis Walk, appears to be the species which I have 

 identified for it. 



Not having seen Mr. Saunders's collection, I have not been able to identify 

 the Limnobias ignobilis, prominens, biterminata, and t u r p i s de- 

 scribed by Mr. Walker in the Diptera Saundersiana. 



In the Museum of Berlin I have found a considerable number of undeter- 

 mined Limnobiae and Eriopterse from Georgia, most of which I have been 

 able to identify with the species described in my paper. Only a few were new 

 to me. I will give here a list of these species, as an addition to the knowledge 

 of their geographical distribution. Some observations and corrections to my 

 descriptions, especially when they were drawn from a limited number of speci- 

 mens, may also find their place here. 



Limnophila adusta in two (^ ) specimens. The brown line in the middle 

 of the thorax was hardly apparent. The tips of the femora were distinctly in- 

 fuscated. 



Limnophila imbecilla(?) A single tf* specimen, which had the neura- 

 tion of the wings, the long verticils, etc.. of said species, but the coloring of the 

 body of which was somewhat different, namely, brownish ferruginous, shilling on 



I860.] 




16 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



the thorax. This coloring may have been merely accidental, and produced per- 

 haps after the death of the specimen. 



Limnophila pavonina, a single $ specimen, slightly different from the 

 specimen from which my description was drawn. The first joint of the antennae 

 is cinereous, the second brown, the following are orange. The tip of the an- 

 tenna is brownish. The abdomen shows a brown stripe along the middle of the 

 tergum and indications of such stripes along the lateral margins. The brown 

 spots on the wings are more confluent than in my specimen, so that the outlines 

 of the ocelli and ocelliform marks are less distinct than is mentioned in my 

 description. 



Limnophila te n u ip e s Say. Limnophila n. sp. (onespecimen.) Araa- 

 lopis inconstans. Teucholabis complex a. Teucholabis n. sp. (with a 

 ferrugineous, shining thorax.) Geranomyia communis. Gnophomyia t r i s - 

 tissima. Gnophomyia lugubris. Dicranoptycha sobrina. Dicra- 

 noptycha sororcula. Erioptera v e n u s t a . E r i o c e r a n. sp. (? very like 

 the cinereous specimens mentioned at the end of my description of Eriocera 

 f uli gin osa.) 



Nov. gen. et sp. (?) of my group of Tipulre anisomeraeformes, and very 

 like Eriocera, but distinguished by the presence of a petiolated areolet 

 and the antennae, which are a little longer, especially those of the $. The 

 species is easily distinguished by the color of the tarsi, which are white, except 

 at the base. 



In the same museum I saw Gonomyia b Ian da and Limnophila lutei- 

 pennnis, from South Carolina ; Rhipidia domestica, from Brazil, (!) and 

 Rhamphidia brevirostris, from South Carolina. The latter had the tho- 

 rax a little darker, and the three stripes on it more distinctly marked than in 

 my specimens ; nevertheless, I hardly doubt of their identity. 



I succeeded besides by examining the dipterological collections in Europe, in 

 ascertaining, as I had hoped, the occurrence, in other parts of the world than 

 in North America, of some of the new genera adopted in my paper. 



Gnophomyia occurs in Brazil and in Europe. I saw two elegant species 

 of this genus (Gnophomyia nigrina Wied., and . sp. ?) in the Berlin Museum, 

 and a European species (taken near Berlin) in a private collection. 



Dicr ano ptyc h a is also European. The Limnobia c i n e r as cen s 3Ieiy., 

 (syn. L. rufescens Schum.l) belongs to this genus, as I ascertained in Mr. 

 Loew's collection. 



Antochais also found in Europe ; a species very like my A. opalizans 

 occurs there. (Mr. Loew's collection.) 



Dactylolabis the L. di la tat a Loeiv from Croatia, (described in his 

 Neue Beitriige, 4tes Heft,) belongs to this subgenus. The remarkable dilata- 

 tion of the anterior margin of the wing, in the stigmatical region, which is 

 peculiar to this species, is hardly perceptible in my D. montana; still it 

 exists, although in a rudimental state; besides this, the structure of the ^ 

 forceps, (as far as could be ascertained from dry specimens,) that of the an- 

 tennae, and the situation of the spots on the wings, coincide in both species. 



Epiphragma. A Brazilian species of this subgenus, very like my E. 

 solatrix, is in the Berlin Museum; another, from Venezuela, is in Mr. 

 Loew's collection. 



Teucholabis. Two species from Brazil in the Berlin Museum; one of 

 them is exceedingly like T. complexa. 



A further object which I had, in examining the collections in Europe, was 

 to ascertain the possible identity of some of the American species, which I had 

 described as new, with European ones. The general result of my observations 

 is, that although cases of apparent analogy are not unfrequent, those of real identity 

 seem to be much rarer. My L. t r i s t i g m a is very distinct from L. tripunctata 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



Meig. The position of the clouds round the stigma is quite different in these 

 species; likewise, the insect which I have redescribed under the name of L. 

 morio Fair, is different from the European insect of that name. Although 

 I had no American specimen at hand for comparison, I could perceive at once 

 that the wings of the European ones were less infuscated. I restore, therefore, 

 to the American species the name ofL. morioides, which I at first intended 

 for it. 



Limnophila f as ciat a Linn. andRhipidia m ac ul at a Meig. have not struck 

 me as being different from the American species which I have re-described 

 under the same names ; still, as I had no specimens of the latter for comparison, 

 I would not rely on a mere impression. 



My Amalopis inconstans has the greatest resemblance with Limnobia 

 littoralis Meig. My A. auripennis is closely related to A. occulta. 

 Other cases of analogy which I observed are between Pedicia albivitta 

 Walk., and P. rivosa, Dactylolabis montanaO.&rf., and Limnophila 

 sexmaculata Meig., Limnobia c i n c t i p e s Say. and L. a n n u 1 u s Meig., 

 L. solitaria and L. quadrinotata. 



In establishing the genus Elephantomyia, T had ventured the suppo- 

 sition that Toxorhina Loew had been founded on female specimens 011I3-, 

 and that, if the males were known, the neuration of their wings would be found 

 to be like that of the males of Limnobiorhynchus Westw., that is, 

 considerably different from the females. This supposition has proved correct. 

 Mr. Loew has obtained since several male specimens of Toxorhina (fossil.) 

 They have a distinct radial vein, which, as usual, runs between the cubital and 

 the radial areae. The question of the synonymy of Limnobiorhynchus 

 and Toxorhina may therefore be considered as settled. 



The examination of specimens of Macrochile Loew included in amber, 

 proved that this genus, like my Protoplasa, has the anal angle of the 

 wing square and not rounded. 



Note. In the analytical table on p. 232 (Proc. 1859,) the fifth line should 

 be continuous with the fourth, the species L. fuscovaria forming in fact 

 the group Dicranophragma.

I have made some experiments for the purpose of ascertaining if various

 placed in the Erie Canal, at various times, but no evidence has yet been had of 

 their multiplying : Unio radiatus from Schuyler's Lake. Unio campto- 

 don Say, from Ohio ; U. parvus Say, from Ohio ; U. undulatus Bar., 

 from Ohio ;U. cariosus Say, from Troy, N. Y.; An. i m p 1 i c a t a Say, from

A variety of Lymnaea known as catascopium Say, abounds in the 

 Canal, and it is very usual for their eggs to be washed over the sides of an 

 aqueduct into a small creek, where they come to maturity, to be washed into 

 the river with the fall floods. One or two favorable seasons have enabled 

 me to ascertain that those which came to maturity have the form of 

 el o d e s. A small pool of stagnant water, formerly the bed of the Canal pre- 

 vious to its enlargement, is populated by thousands of Ly mnasa that for- 

 merly formed part of the Canal family. These vary in their forms in different 

 seasons ; some retain the form of catascopium, others diverge to emar- 

 g i n a t a, but a larger number are elodes. ThePaludinaof the Lakes I 

 regard as de ci s a, but they are probably not the same as the shells of the 

 Canal and River that have that name. 



Notes on the Nomenclature of North American Fishes.

The following notes are selected from a large number on American and foreign 

 fishes in the possession of the author. Others upon North American fishes are 

 reserved until a more complete examination can be made ; it is hoped that the 

 following may, in the mean time, be of service to the student of American 

 Ichthyology.

20 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



1. Labrax chrysops Girard. There is little doubt that the Labrax 

 albidus of Dr. Dekay* and the Labrax osculatii of Filippi f are identi- 

 cal with the Labrax chrysops. Filippi, although acquainted with the work 

 of Dekay, compares his Labrax osc ula tii only with the L. li n e at us Cuv., 

 and chiefly distinguishes it from that species by its higher body and lingual 

 dentition. The specimens, from which the species of Filippi was described, 

 were sent to the Museum of Milan by the traveller to whom it was dedicated, 

 (M. Osculati,) and are stated by Filippi to have been obtained in Lake Ontario. 

 Notwithstanding this, Filippi has stated that it is an inhabitant of the sea and 

 the rivers of the United States. "Hab. in mare et fluvis confederationis Amer- 

 icanse." 



2. Lepomis ach i gan Gill. RafinesqueJ first indicated the Cicha fas- 

 ciata of Lesueur or Centrarchus obscurus of Dekay, under the name of 

 Bodianus achigan. His specific name must be preserved. 



3. Ambloplites rupestris Gill. The Bodianus rupestris of Rafin- 

 esque, described in December, 181 7, $ appears to be the same as the species 

 subsequently named Cichla senea by Lesueur. 



4. Pomotis maculatus Gill. The common sun fish of New York was 

 first named Morone maculata by Mitchell. || His specific name should be 

 retained. 



(Corinia oxyptera Dekay. H) This is a species of the genus Serranus. 



5. Orthopristis fulvo-maculatus Gill. If the genus Orthopris- 

 t i s is valid, the Haemulon fulvo-maculatum of Dekay** must be referred 

 to it under the above name. That species differs very little, if at all, from the 

 Orthopristis duplex of Dr. Girard. ff The two are probably identical. 



6. Sargus ovicephalus Gill. The common sheep's-head was first named 

 by BlochJJ from the description of Schoepf.$$ 



Palindrichthys Gill. 



This name is proposed as a substitute for P a 1 i n u r u s of Dekay. The latter 

 name having been applied to a well-known genus of crustaceans, it is inadmis- 

 sible in any other branch of the animal kingdom. 



7. Palinurichthys perciformis Gill. Syn. Palinurus perciformis

 The type of this genus is congeneric with the type of the subsequently estab- 

 lished genus, P i 1 e o m a of Dekay. The latter name is therefore a synonym of 

 Percina, and must be suppressed.

American U. anoplos of Cuvier. Astroscopus differs from Uranos- 

 copus by a less completely armed head, and by the absence of an exsertile 

 filament to the membrane behind the symphisis of the lower joint. To this 

 genus is also to be referred the Uranoscopos y-graecum of Cuvier and Val- 

 enciennes.

 of Swainson. J 



Leptoblennius Gill. 



This genus is founded on the Blennius serpentinus of Dr. D. H. Storer. 

 It differs widely from Blennius by the elongated form of the body, the shape 

 of the head, absence of superciliary tentacles, &c. It is equally distinct from 

 the genus P h o li s .

MOLACANTHUS Sw. 



The genus called by Dekay Acanthosorna had been previously named 

 by Swainson Molacanthus, and that appellation has been accepted by the 

 Prince of Canino.|| Swainson founded his genus on the Diodon mola of 

 Pallas, a species to which Dekay has referred in his remarks on Acanthosorna 

 carinatum.

Dr. Richardson has figured in the Ichthyology of the Voyage of the Sulphur,^ 

 a species of molacanthus, which he has named Orthagoriscus s p i n o s u s 

 Cuv., citing for that name the Regne Animal, vol. i. p. 370. On reference to 

 the volume of Cuvier, it will be seen that the name of Orthogoriscus s p i n o s u s 

 is attributed to Bloch of Schneider; in a foot note to the genns enumerating 

 the species, it is again referred to as Orthogoriscus h i s p i d u s . The latter is 

 the name given to the species in the Systema Ichthyologist,** and the former was 

 probably due to an oversight of Cuvier. The species of Richardson is also, 

 perhaps, a distinct species from the Molacanthus hispid us Bon., and is an 

 inhabitant of the Chinese seas. 



On the Pertinence of the ALOSA TERES Dekay, to the Genus DUSSUMIERA Val. 



BY THEO. GILL. 



In the ichthyological volume of " Zoology of New York,f f " Dr. Dekay has 

 described a halecoid fish to which he has given the name of Alosa teres. He 

 has characterized the genus Alosa as having the characters of Clupea 

 (body compressed,) but distinguished by the tongue and the roof of the mouth 

 being smooth or edentulous. Notwithstanding this definition, he has without

hesitation, referred to the genus the above fish which he describes as having 

 the " body cylindrical" and with its tongue covered " with asperities on its surface." 

 In the " Histoire Naturelle des Poissons,"* Valenciennes, misled perhaps by the 

 generic definition of Dekay, has described what appears to be a true Alosa, 

 as the Alosa teres of Dekay. In the same volume f he has described a fish 

 to which he has given the name of Dussumiera acuta; this fish is there 

 stated to have a most close superficial resemblance to the sardines of the 

 Clupeoid family, but as being separated from them on account of the 

 smooth belly, and as being more nearly related to Butirinus, between 

 which genus and E 1 o p s it was believed that it should be placed. 



Subsequently, Mr. James C. Brevoort, in his " Notes on the Figures of Japan- 

 ese Fish,"| (originally published in the second volume of the Narrative of the 

 United States Expedition to Japan, under Commodore Perry,) in a note on 

 Clupea micropus of Temminck and Schleger, corrected the erroneous ref- 

 erence of Valenciennes, and noticed the near affinity of the Alosa teres to the 

 genus Dussumiera. 



Recently, in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy, Dr. Charles 

 Girard has referred the same species to the genus Harengula of Valenciennes, 

 on account of the presence of teeth upon the maxillar bones, the tongue, the 

 palatines,, and the pterygoidians, whilst the vomer is toothless." In dentition, 

 A. teres does indeed agree with Harengula, but is totally separated from 

 that genus by the form of the body, and is correctly referable to D u s s u m e r i a, 

 which has teeth upon the same bones, and otherwise agrees with Alosa t er e s . 



The species must, consequently, be hereafter called Dussumiera teres, and 

 its synonymy will be as follows :

The Mexican Humming Birds. 

 BY RAFAEL MONTES DE OCA, 

 Of Jalapa, Mexico. 

 No. I. 

 Campylopterus De Lattrei Gould. 

 Mellisuga De Lattrei Gray. 

 De Lattre's Sabre Wing, Gould, Monograph, part x. 



This beautiful Humming Bird, or colibri, is generally known in Mexico by 

 the name of Chupa-mirto real azul, or Royal blue Myrtle-sucker. It comes 

 abundantly to the vicinity of Jalapa, Coatepec and Orizaba, in the months of 

 October and November, and is mostly found eating the honey of a plant called 

 Masapan. It is one of those birds that do not rise early in the morning to 

 hunt their food, for very few are found earlier than nine o'clock in the morn- 

 ing, and from that time till twelve or one o'clock appears to be their breakfast 

 hours. During this time they are but very seldom seen to alight, and for a 

 very short time only in any one place, for they go constantly from flower to 

 flower, sucking the honey, and from one place to another, describing in their 

 flight a part of a circle, and sometimes almost touching the ground. In the 

 same manner also they are seen to come, so that by placing oneself where there 

 are such plants in blossom, it is easy to shoot several specimens in one morn- 

 ing without walking very far or moving much about. During the remainder 

 of the day, very few are to be seen, and it is very probable that they go into the 

 woods, where they find certain kinds of mosquitoes, with which I have often 

 found their craws well filled. 



This bird is extremely shy, but is very easily tamed, most probably on account 

 of its very gluttonous disposition ; for once caged and. provided with a little cup 

 containing syrup, without any trouble he finds it readily when he is hungry, 

 and I have seen them feasting in this manner, half an hour after having been 

 made prisoners. It is difficult to keep them alive, and I have never been able 

 to preserve them for a longer time than two months, which, I think, is more 

 on account of the want of exercise than of the coming of the winter season as 

 is generally believed here, for I have found, though rarely, in the middle of 

 what we call a severe winter, the handsomest specimens that I have ever 

 seen. 



The aversion that the males of this species bear to each other as well as to 

 all of their kind is very remarkable. It is very seldom that two meet together 

 without there ensuing an aerial battle worthy of a most magnificent picture. 

 It commences with a sharp, choleric shriek, which makes them swell out their 

 throats, and raising all the feathers of their bodies, and spreading open their 

 tails, they begin to fight with their wings and bills, and the least powerful soon 

 tumbles to the ground or else runs away. I have never seen one of these bat- 

 tles last longer than about ten seconds, and in the specimens that I have had 

 under my notice in cages, nearly always this fighting has ended in the splitting 

 of the tongue of one of the two, which then surely dies on account of not beintr 

 able to eat. 



The place of incubation of this bird is very probably Guatemala, where it i?

also found abundantly, and to which country it certainly migrates in the latter 

 part of November. I have never found nor heard that it goes farther north 

 than the first mentioned places above. The nest I have never found. 



This species of humming bird, in the general appearance of its body, is of a deep 

 metallic shining turquoise blue, of the most beautiful shade ; the upper part of 

 the head is brown tinged with bronze green, the upper wing and tail coverts 

 shining bronze green, the wing feathers are purplish black with the vanes of 

 the three principal ones on each side black, very wide and resembling whale- 

 bone. The tail is bright bluish black, with the three feathers of each side 

 having about three quarters of an inch of a pure white, and sometimes the 

 fourth partakes of a little of the white also. The upper part of each leg is 

 covered with white downy feathers, running apparently into each other in a 

 line of the same color below the under tail coverts ; the feet are purplish black ; 

 the bill black, resembling whalebone. Total length of this specimen is 5| 

 inches, wing 3^, tail 2|, bill 1^ inches. 



The female is about half an inch smaller than the male, and her appear- 

 ance is, in the upper part of the body, upper wing and tail coverts, of a metal- 

 lic bronze green ; the upper part of the head is bronze, tinged with yellowish 

 bronzed green. The breast is of a light iron gray, with the sides tinged with 

 bronze green. The throat feathers have the points tinged with blue of the 

 same shade as the male. The wings are purplish black, but the vanes of the 

 side quills are not half so strong as those of the male ; the tail is very much 

 like that of the male, with the difference of the two middle feathers, which 

 are bronzed green. The under tail coverts are tinged with the same color, with 

 the edges of light iron gray, like the breast. The feet and bill are of the same 

 size and color as those of the male. 



The Reports of the Publication Committee and the Committee on 

 Proceedings were read and adopted. 



Pursuant to the By-Laws of the Academy an election of the members 

 of the Standing Committees for 1860 was held, with the following re-

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 49 



February 7th. 

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 



Forty-nine members present. 



The following were presented for publication : 



" Descriptions of new species of American Fluviatile Gasteropods, 

 by J. G. Anthony." 



" Supplement to a Catalogue of the Venomous Serpents in the 

 Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences, by E. D. Cope." 



" Catalogue of the Calamarian Serpents in the Museum of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences, with notes and descriptions, by E. D. 

 Cope." 



Mr. Binney called attention to a species of Leda, presented this evening, 

 which, Dr. Gould states, is common to Japan and Massachusetts. 



A discussion on geographical distribution then took place, in which Dr. 

 Le Conte mentioned that he had prepared a map representing the provinces 

 of geographical distribution of Coleoptera in the territories of the United 

 States ; he divides the temperate part of the continent into three (or perhaps 

 four) districts : 1. Atlantic, extending westwardly to the longitude of the 

 mouth of the Platte ; 2. Central, extending from the mouth of the Platte to 

 the Sierra Nevada ; 3. Pacific, including the water shed of the maritime 

 Pacific coast. These districts are each divided into several provinces, and with 

 larger collections the Central, as at present defined, may be found to be in 

 reality two districts, limited by the Rocky Mountains ; of these the eastern 

 will be called the Central, and the western the Interior district. This map 

 accompanies a memoir on the Coleoptera of Kansas, Nebraska and New Mexico, 

 published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. 



Mr. Binney remarked, that having prepared for the Smithsonian Institution 

 a catalogue of the terrestrial and fluviatile Gasteropods of North America, he 

 was able to present the following results : 



Of the boreal regions but little is known. The only data we have are from 

 Greenland. Both the fresh water and land species are peculiar to that country, 

 excepting the European Helix hortevsis, which has been introduced also in 

 Canada and New England. 



Of Mexico also but little is known. A few of its land species are found in 

 Texas ; they are, however, confined to that region, not extending farther north. 

 The genera are more tropical than in the rest of the continent. Fluviatile 

 species are very rare in Mexico, judging from the few data we have. The 

 species appear different from those of the Atlantic region. 



On the west coast the species of land shells are quite distinct from those of 

 the Atlantic region, excepting Bulimus zebra ; the genera, however, are the 

 same, though fewer in number. Among the fluviatile species are found eleven 

 species of Pulmonates, which also inhabit the Atlantic region. 



In the Atlantic region are two or three species of land shells found in 

 Europe, and a few fluviatile Pulmonates. The occurrence of the Asiatic 

 species quoted from the United States may well be doubted. 



The following table shows the facts presented by Mr. Binney. It is neces- 

 sarily imperfect, owing to the small amount of material, the somewhat con- 

 fused synonymy, &c. 



Column 1 contains the species found in the Pacific region.

Forty-nine members present. 



A paper was presented for publication, entitled : 



" Descriptions of new species of Cyrena and Corbicula in the Cab- 

 inet of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by Temple 

 Prime. 



Mr. Lea remarked that when Mr. Binney, at the last meeting, called the at- 

 tention of the members to a reversed Paludina on the table, the discussion tak- 

 ing a wide range, he (Mr. Lea) stated that an abnormal reversed character 

 sometimes occurred in the genus Unio, and he then mentioned that hehad spe- 

 cimens of various species where this condition was very remarkable. He also 

 then stated that among Helices, in a semi-domesticated position in gardens, 

 hedge-rows, &c, in England and on the continent it was not a very rare cir- 

 cumstance to find heterostrophe individuals; he had quite a number; but that 

 among the immense number of our own species which had passed under his 

 eyes, he had found only a single specimen which was heterostrophe, viz. : a 

 Helix hirsuta, Say. Mr. Lea went on to say that he had prepared himself to ex- 

 hibit, to-night, his specimens alluded to, and to which he now called the atten- 

 tion of the members. He was glad to see by the December number of the Pro- 

 ceedings of the Boston Soc. Nat. Hist, received by post to-day, that Prof. Agas- 

 siz had made a communication to the Society on "reversed bivalve shells," ex- 

 hibiting a specimen of the Unio ligamentinus, Lamarck, observing that " it was 

 quite rare and generally not easily observed." Mr. Lea exhibited twenty-one 

 specimens of various species which were all abnormal as regarded their lateral 

 teeth, some having a single one in both valves, others being simply reversed as to 

 the double and single cardinal and lateral teeth ; others having double lateral 

 teeth in both valves, and others again having a treble lateral tooth in the left 

 valve, and a double one in the right valve. The first reversed Unio he had seen 

 was a specimen of complanalus from the mill-dam at Bristol, Penna., about 25 

 years since ; afterward he had found one in the Schuylkill, and subsequently 

 found them occasionally among thousands of specimens sent by friends from 

 various parts of the United States. From Dr. Lewis, of Mohawk, he had re- 

 ceived some very fine specimens. 



The following table will exhibit the various abnormal forms of Uniones in 

 Mr. Lea's collection :

Mr. Lea stated that in his first paper published in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 

 in 1827, he paid attention to the difference of the teeth, and in 1829 he publish- 

 ed a description of that remarkable Unio from the Schuylkill, described under 

 the name of heterodon, from the very peculiar and aberrant form of the double 

 lateral tooth being placed in the right valve, and the single in the left one. 

 This was the first form of the kind which had ever come under his notice. A 

 few years subsequently he found the first specimen of an abnormal character, 

 conforming exactly to the normal condition of the heterodon, and this was in the 

 Bristol specimen. Since that period he observed closely the abnormal forms of 

 the species, and the result is given in the previous table. But it must be im- 

 pressed on the zoologist's mind, that the form of teeth which is normal in one 

 species, may be abnormal in another, because, while there is impressed on 

 every species a law as regards its form, and the general one of this species of 

 Unio is to have the lateral tooth double in the left, and single in the right 

 valve, and the cardinal either the same or double in both, yet aberrant forms 

 from this are quite numerous, as will be found in the following table of 

 species. He wished the attention of the members to the fact that what 

 was abnormal in some individuals of a species, would be perfectly normal 

 in others ; thus, in complanatus, when the lateral teeth are found double in the 

 right, and single in the left, they are reversed, and therefore abnormal ; but in 

 the heterodon this condition of the teeth is normal, and so it will be with other 

 conditions of other species, even so far removed from the typical Unio as in the 

 ezimius, Lea, from Siam, which has a treble lateral tooth in the left, and a dou- 

 ble one in the right valve as its normal form, for this is imitated by the speci- 

 men of corrugatus exhibited, which has the treble tooth in the left valve, and 

 double one in the right, which in this case is remarkable, its normal condition 

 being that of the typical Unio. 



In the following table will be found most of the species which, while they 

 are perfectly normal, are still aberrant from the typical Unio, all of them but 

 two having been described by Mr. Lea.

It is not pretended that the last table is entirely complete. The object is ac- 

 complished to shew that the teeth of different species vary normally, and that 

 individuals of the species vary abnormally. 



As regards the genus Triquetra, Klein, (ffyria, Lamark,) which has cardinal 

 and lateral teeth in both valves, so far as observed the lateral tooth in the 

 left valve is double, and in the right single. 



The cardinal tooth in both valves is usually lamellar and multiplied, and 

 articulate closely. In some cases it is much longer than in others of the 

 same species. In one specimen of T. subviridis, Klein, in Mr. Lea's cabinet, the 

 the cardinal tooth is almost the same length of the lateral tooth ; and in two 

 specimens both teeth have transverse striae like Prisodon, Schum. (Castalia, 

 Lam.) which of course is an aberrant form. The Triquetra contorta, Lea, is an 

 aberrant species, the cardinal teeth in both valves being obtusely conical and 

 double in both valves. I have never met with any abnormal form of teeth in 

 any of the species of Triquetra, but so few specimens get into the cabinets that 

 if they do exist none have yet been detected. 



The genus Prisodon, the teeth of which are so nearly the same as those of 

 Unio as to induce M. Deshayes to put it in that genus, are almost identical 

 with some of the species, except in character of transverse parallel striae ; 

 and even this characteristic of the genus is absent in some of Mr. Lea's 

 specimens of truncatus, Schum., (ambigua, Lam.) If, however, the lobes of 

 the mantle are united behind so as to form two tubes, there would be no pro- 

 priety in placing it with the Uniones, as the mantle is never united in that part 

 in them. 



Prof. R. E. Rogers made some remarks on the debitumenization of coal, 

 and also communicated tbe following facts having reference to the propaga- 

 tion of concussion from rock-blasting to strata at a distance, as exemplified 

 in the effect upon the water of wells. 



A well, sixty feet in depth, with the water rising within ten feet of the sur- 

 face, had, previous' to the occurrence, been yielding a large supply of water 

 to an extensive factory, when, immediately upon the discharge of a heavy 

 blast in a stone quarry about four hundred yards distant, the water began to 

 fall, and soon altogether disappeared. 



I860.] 




5-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Another well, remote from the last mentioned one, had been yielding a good 

 supply of water for more than a year. A blast of ordinary violence was dis- 

 charged in an excavation for stone, three hundred yards distant from it, where- 

 upon the water quickly and entirely disappeared. The proprietor directed a 

 boring to be made in the bottom of the well six feet in depth and a blast to 

 be set off in it. , 



The result was as curious as the one which preceded it. The water at once 

 reappeared, and the supply has since been steady and in great abundance. 



Dr. Leidy observed that the remarks of Prof. Rogers, had reminded him of 

 the so-called Hillsboro coal or Albertite, of Albert Co., New Brunswick. This 

 substance Dr. L. regards as a variety of Asphaltum and not as coal. The 

 latter consists of the fossil remains of plants. The Albertite is a product re- 

 sulting from the distillation of bitumenous coals or shales. Coal always pre- 

 sents in microscopic section the remains of vegetable structure ; Albertite is 

 perfectly amorphous. Coals are stratified or interstratified with other sub- 

 stances ; the Albertite presents many evidences of being an injected material 

 into fissures of the surrounding shales.

Descriptions of New Species of American Fluviatile Gasteropods. 

 BY J. G. ANTHONY. 



Melania angustispira, Anthony. Shell thick, elongate, very slender ; color 

 reddish-brown, with a narrow pale line at the suture; whorls 9-10, lower ones 

 subconvex, smooth, upper ones flattened and carinate near their bases : sutures 

 slight; aperture narrow-ovate, within pale purple; columella regularly curved: 

 sinu3 not remarkable. 



Hab. Tennessee.

Obs. May be compared with M. ezilis, Hald., than which it is more slender, 

 more attenuate, and of more solid texture ; its color is also entirely different, 

 being more like M. Warderiana, Lea, but wanting the peculiar bulbous form of 

 that species. The carinations do not extend to the three lower whorls ; upon 

 these they are entirely wanting. It is a peculiarly slender and graceful species. 



M. decorata, Anthony. Shell short, thick, ovate ; whorls about five, but 

 truncate so as to show only two or three remaining ; whorls prominently ribbed 

 and intersected by revolving strise, forming nodules where they cross each 

 other; dark bands also revolve around the whorls, giving them a highly deco- 

 rative appearance ; columella often thickened by a callous deposit ; sinus 

 small. 



Hab. Oostanulla River, Georgia. 



My Cab.; Cab Hugh Cuming, London; A. N. S. Philada.; State Collection, 

 Albany, N. Y. ; Smithsonian Collection, Washington, D. C. 



Obs. I collected some two hundred specimens of this species in Oostanulla 

 River, Ga., in 1853, and then supposed they would prove to be merely the 

 young of M. ccelatura, Con. Closer examination and comparison, however, 

 has convinced me that they are not identical. Many of the specimens are 

 decidedly mature, and differ from " ccelatura" by the greater regularity of their 

 folds, which are also interrupted by a revolving raised line near the sutures, 

 and by their dark bands and less elongate form ; cannot well be compared with 

 any other. 



M. adusta, Anthony. Shell conical, smooth, shining; color dark brown, 

 with a pale line near the sutures ; whorls 7-8, flat ; body whorl rather large, 

 subangulated and with somewhat coarse lines of growth ; sutures distinct, but 

 not remarkable ; aperture ovate, dark purple within ; outer lip curved, colu- 

 mella deeply rounded, a broad sinus at base.

Obs. A neat, pretty species, of rather plain appearance. Compared with M. 

 gracilior, nob., it is broader, shorter, and of darker color ; the broad deep cinc- 

 ture on the body-whorl and beautiful red bands in the interior, so conspicuous 

 in M. gracilior, are also wanting. From " atbleta" it differs by its shorter, more 

 acute form, and by the absence of folds. It is less slender than M. viridula. 



M. bicincta, Anthony. Shell conical, elevated, spire very acute ; whorls 7, 

 upper ones bicarinate, and body whorl encircled by three or four carinae, the 

 upper two of which are prominent, while the lower two are often striae merely ; 

 color dark olive brown, very shining, and relieved by a faint or yellow narrow 

 band near the suture; sutures distinct; aperture ovate, and brown within; 

 columella deeply indented. 



Hab. Tennessee. 



My Cabinet ; Cab. Hugh Cnming, London ; A. N. S. Philada. ; State Collection,

Obs. A beautifully distinct and well marked species of that group which M. 

 bella, Conrad, may be considered most fitly to represent. May be distinguished 

 from M. bella by its broader and more acute form, more distinct carination and 

 absence of the beaded line so characteristic of that species. Lines of growth 

 conspicuous and crowded. Differs from M. bicostata, nob., by its less robust 

 form, darker color, and by the form of its spire, which diminishes more rapidly 

 towards the apex. 



M. abscida, Anthony. Shell ovate, smooth, olivaceous, thick ; spire obtuse, 

 composed of five low whorls nearly flat ; body whorl large, occupying nearly 

 the entire length of the shell ; aperture not broad but long, subrhombic, more 

 than half the length of the shell; columella deeply rounded and indented, 

 outer lip much curved and produced ; sinus broad and conspicuous. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A ponderous species, whose chief characteristic is its square form and 

 short truncate spire, resembling in that respect M. planospira, nob. It differs 

 from that species, however, by its more elongate form, narrow, rhombic aper- 

 ture, and by having several revolving striae at base. It is a solid shell of com- 

 pact texture, and seems to be rare, as only two specimens have come under my 

 notice. 



M. bicostata, Anthony. Shell conical, light horn color, rather thick; spire 

 elevated, acute; whorls 11-12, strongly carinate near the apex, and decidedly 

 80 on each succeeding whorl, not excepting even the body-whorl in most cases, 

 though sometimes obsolete there; carinae often in pairs, near to, and parallel 

 with each other; sutures deeply impressed, often with a decided furrow at that 

 point, caused by the carinae. Aperture broadly elliptical, or subrhombic ; 

 within dirty white or obscurely banded ; columella deeply rounded, with a well- 

 marked sinus at base. 



Hab. Tennessee, near Athens. 



My Cabinet; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London; Cab. A. N. S. Philada.; State

Obs. Appears to be a very abundant and rather variable species. Several 

 hundred individuals have come under my notice. It cannot well be confounded 

 with any other species, though of a form by no means uncommon. The sharp 

 double carina will at once generally determine it. Occurs abundantly near 

 Athens, in small streams. 



M. fdnebralis, Anthony. Shell conic, smooth, solid, of a dark chesnut 

 color; spire elevated and generally abruptly truncate; whorls from 3 to 5 only 

 remaining, slightly eonvex ; aperture ovate, within bluish; columella white, 

 tinged occasionally with purple; sinus small.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



Obs A very neat, pretty species, with no very decided character to distin- 

 guish it from allied species. May be compared with M. brevispira, nob., but is 

 far more solid in its texture, of a darker color, and its surface is more polished 

 and shining ; much less slender too than brevispira, and that species is never so 

 abruptly decollate. It appears to be an abundant species. 



M. glauca, Anthony. Shell conical, folded, of a green color on the lower 

 whorls, often modified by a brown tinge on the upper ones ; whorls 10, slightly 

 convex, with prominent longitudinal ribs, obsolete on the body- whorl; sutures 

 well defined, but not deeply marked ; aperture ovate, livid within and with 

 occasionally a faint rosy tinge there; columella angulated at the middle; sinus 

 well defined. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A stout species, with prominent, curved ribs on all the upper whorls, 

 those on the body-whorl being less clearly defined or else absolutely wanting. 

 Color a beautiful apple-green, relieved by a broad yellow band near the suture ; 

 and this color often passes into a yellowish brown on the upper whorls. Near 

 the apex the folds are often traversed by four or five prominent striae, which 

 pass over without being interrupted by the longitudinal ribs. May be com- 

 pared with M. viridula, nob., as to color, but is less slender, and the ribs at 

 once distinguish it. 



M. infrafasciata, Anthony. Shell conical, smooth, solid, of a pale brown 

 color, form moderately slender and elevated; whorls 8-9, decollate, slightly 

 concave; sutures distinct; lines of growth curved and very distinct ; body- 

 whorl decidedly concave, with a well-marked ridge revolving near the summit 

 of the aperture, so as to make a tolerably sharp angle near the middle of the 

 body-whorl ; two or three coarse striae revolve parallel with it ; below this is a 

 dark brown band, continued around the base of the shell ; aperture rhombic- 

 ovate, livid and banded within ; columella strongly incurved, with a callous 

 deposit its whole leDgth and well-defined sinus at base.

Obs. Compared with M. gradata, nob., it is more elongate, more solid, and 

 has not the carina and regularly graded whorls so characteristic of that species. 

 Less conical than M. canaliculata Say, and less broad. Like M. annulifera, 

 Con., in form, but has not the revolving costae of that species. 



M. padcicosta, Anthony. Shell conical, nearly smooth, of a dark greenish 

 horn color ; spire obtusely elevated ; whorls nearly flat, with a few distinct 

 longitudinal ribs on the upper ones ; body- whorl entirely smooth ; sutures well 

 marked; aperture ovate, within livid or purple; columella rounded; sinus 

 small.

Obs. Belongs to a group of which nitens may be considered the type. 

 From that species it differs, however, by its more robust form and stronger 

 ribs. There is also a marked peculiarity in this species not often observed in 

 the genus; the spire being acute at the apex, increases regularly for the first 

 four or five turns, and then suddenly expanding, becomes as it were distorted 

 in appearance. The ribs are distant from each other and very strongly 

 expressed, differing in this respect from M. alhleta, which it otherwise resembles. 

 It is a beautiful and appears to be an abundant species. 



M. occulta, Anthony. Shell conic, smooth, rather thin ; color lemon-yellow, 

 inclining to brown, with a darker brown band on each whorl, increasing to two 

 on the body-whorl ; whorls 7-8, rather convex ; suture deeply impressed ; aper- 

 ture ovate, within dusky white, with the outer bands seen faintly through its

 base. 



Hab. Wisconsin. 



My Cab. ; Cab. H. Cuming, London; A. N. S. Philada. ; State Coll., Albany,

Obs. A very beautiful and lively species. Bears some resemblance to M. 

 pulchella, nob., but is less elongate, more delicately colored, and of a less solid 

 texture ; the bands are often obsolete, and never so distinctly expressed as in 

 pulchella ; its spire is also more acute and the whorls more rounded. Com- 

 pared with M. brevispira, nob., which in form it resembles, it is more attenuate, 

 has a greater number of whorls, and its bands also distinguish it. Its delicate 

 yellow color also is not a common character in the genus, and forms a promi- 

 nent mark for determination. 



M. opaca, Anthony. Shell ovate, thick, smooth, of a dark brown color ; spire 

 short, composed of about six convex whorls; body-whorl large, subangulated 

 in the centre ; sutures indicated by a narrow lighter line, and very distinct ; 

 aperture ovate, livid within ; columella indented and tinged with purple ; outer 

 lip a little curved ; sinus not remarkable. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A dusky inconspicuous shell of no great beauty. Only two specimens 

 have ever come under my notice, but I am persuaded, nevertheless, that they 

 are distinct cannot well be compared with any other species. More smooth 

 than M. athleta, nob., and devoid of ribs, which that species has. Its dark, 

 dirty, brown color down to about the middle of the body-whorl and pale olive- 

 green underneath, together with its purple columella, may sufficiently distin- 

 guish it. 



M. pulchereima, Anthony. Shell conical, carinate, elevated, acute ; whorls 

 6-8, flat, upper ones obscurely ribbed longitudinally ; body whorl sharply angu- 

 lated, with a dark brown band directly upon the carina, and 2 or 3 below it, 

 one of which is very near the carina. Upper whorls with 2 bands each, widely 

 separated; sutures distinct, rendered more so by the neighboring carina; aper- 

 ture ovate, within 3 or 4 banded ; columella rounded and indented, sinus small. 



Hab. North Carolina. 



My Cabinet, Cabinet H. Cuming, London ; Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila. ; State 

 Collection Albany, New York ; Smithsonian Collection. 



Obs. A small but remarkably beautiful species ; its bright yellow ground and 

 conspicuous dark lines give, by contrast, a lively and pleasant character to the 

 shell. Compared with M. nigrocincta, nob., it is a larger species, its colors 

 are more decided, and its carina are also a prominent mark of difference. M. 

 clara nob. is a larger and more globose species, its bands are broader and it has 

 no carina. It seems to be an abundant species, varying occasionally in some 

 of its characters, but always easily recognized. More than 100 specimens are 

 before me. 



M. tenebrocincta, Anthony. Shell conic-ovate, smooth, rather thick ; spire 

 rather obtusely elevated; whorls 6-7, nearly flat, but with an obtuse carina be- 

 low the middle of each, and one more decided between that and the suture ; 

 suture well marked and with a pale band near it ; lines of growth decided ; 

 aperture linear-ovate, within dusky and having 2 dark bands there, sinus very 

 decided. 



Hab. Tennessee. 



My Cabinet, Cabinet H. Cuming, London; Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.; State

Obs. Compared with M. valida nob. it is smaller, less robust, more slender, and 

 may also be distinguished from that plain species by its more lirely exterior the 

 dark brown band or bands, contrast finely with the general color of the shell, 

 and with a light band near the sutures.

M. valida, Anthony. Shell ovate-conic, smooth, olivaceous, thick ; spire 

 obtusely elevated, decollate; whorls flat, only about 6 remaining; sutures dis- 

 tinct; lines of growth very strong, amounting to varices on the body whorl; 

 aperture ovate, bluish white withia ; columella strongly curved, or indented 

 about the middle, white; sinus well developed at base; body whorl obscurely, 

 concentrically striate, the striae forming faint nodules where they intersect the 

 varices.

Obs. This species may be compared with M. tenebrocincta herein described 

 from that species it may be distinguished by its more robust form, uniform dark 

 olivaceous color and the absence of the dark bands so conspicuous in that 

 species. It has a very solid, compact form, and this with its regular, uniform 

 size up to the point of decollation, may serve to distinguish it from all others. 



M. gravida, Anthony. Shell ovate, smooth, thick; spire obtusely elevated; 

 whorls 7-8, nearly flat ; sutures well defined ; lines of growth fine, but very dis- 

 tinct ; body whorl large, subangulated ; aperture oval, livid inside ; columella 

 deeply indented, covered with a white callus ; outer lip curved forward, and 

 with the columella forming a small sinus at base. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A stout, heavy shell, in form and color resembling in some degree 

 M. solida, Lea, but is more ovate than that species. Color light brown, 

 smooth but not very shining lines of growth very distinct and curved. A few 

 indistinct strice occur at the base of the shell the lower part of the columella 

 is often tinged with a golden hue. 



M. grossa, Anthony. Shell ovate, folded, thick ; spire obtusely elevated, com- 

 posed of about 8 convex whorls rapidly attenuating to an acute apex ; whorls 

 folded, except the last two ; body whorl tumid, smooth ; color of epidermis light 

 greenish olive; aperture elliptical, whitish inside ; columella rounded; outer 

 lip much curved, with a well marked sinus at base. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A shore thick species whose chief characteristics are its bulbous form, 

 and short but prominent ribs on the upper whorls. All the whorls but the last 

 are remarkably narrow and crowded lines of growth prominent 4 or 5 striae 

 revolve s-round the base or the shell. Resembles M. glandula, nob., in form, but its 

 different color and texture, with its prominent ribs, will at once distinguish it. 



M. ponderosa, Anthony. Shell conic, broad, smooth, olivaceous, thick ; spire 

 considerably but not acutely elevated; whorls 7-8, subconvex; lines of growth 

 curved and strong; sutures distinct; aperture rhombic, rather small, whitish 

 within ; columella indented, outer lips much curved forwards forming a broad 

 well marked sinus at base.

Obs. One of the most ponderous of the genus. In form it resembles JW. 

 canaliculata, Say, but has not the channel of that species, and differs also in the 

 aperture. The body whorl is strongly keeled about the middle and has another 

 and less clearly defined carina about midway between the first and the suture 

 above. The lines of growth are very strong and occasionally varicose. A 

 strong deposit of white callus is found upon the columella, which is much 

 thickened near the base. 



M. TvEniolata, A^nthony. Shell conic-ovate, striate, thick; spire elevated 

 but not acute, composed of 6-7, nearly flat whorls ; sutures not distinct ; aper- 

 ture sub-rhombic, small, banded within ; columella indented, callous at its lower 

 portion, and with a small but distinct sinus at base.

several dark brown bands, generally 2 on each whorl ; body whorl angulated : 

 with one band directly upon the sharp angle, another in close proximity, and 

 a third quite distant and near the base of the shell. Band obsolete on the first 

 two or three whorls. Surface coarsely striate and obscurely ribbed. 



Melania glans, Anthony, being preocupied, I propose to change the name 

 to M. glandula. 



M. assimilis, Anthony. Shell small, short, conic, not thick; spire acute, 

 composed of about 7 flat whorls ; sutures very distinct, of a light horn color; 

 aperture small, ovate, dusky within ; columella indented ; body whorl angu- 

 lated ; sinus not broad, but well formed. 



Hab. Tennessee. My cabinet. 



Obs. A small delicate species ; compared with M. pallidula, nob., it is more 

 slender and elevated, has a greater number of whorls, and is devoid of bands. 

 From M. angulata, nob., it differs in being more slender, more carinate, and 

 haring a more elevated spire. 



M. cubicoides, Anthony. Shell ovate, smooth, thick; whorls 6 1, flat, the 

 upper ones rapidly enlarging to the body whorl, which is broad, and acutely 

 angulated ; sutures distinct, rendered more so by a sharp carination on the 

 lower part of each whorl; aperture broadly ovate, within whitish ; columella 

 deeply indented ; sinus small. 



Hab. Wabash River, Indiana. My Cabinet. 



Obs. One of the short, thick species, in form not unlike M. cuspidala, nob., 

 but differing by its sharp carinated body whorl and imbricated spire ; the body 

 whorl is also strongly striate and obscurely ribbed; these longitudinal ribs are 

 very faint, but sufficiently distinct, at the sharp carina near the summit of the 

 aperture to modify its outline into a waving subnodulous line. 



M. hybrida Anthony. Shell conical, elevated, nearly smooth, horn colored; 

 whorls 8 9, upper ones carinated deeply, lower ones entirely smooth ; color 

 reddish brown, or dark horn color ; sutures distinctly impressed ; aperture 

 small, ovate, tinged with rose color or violet within ; columella rounded but 

 not deeply indented ; sinus small.

Obs. A neat, pretty species, with no very strong distinctive characters ; 

 from intertezta, nobis, which it somewhat resembles ; it may be distinguished 

 by its less acute form, less numerous whorls, and by its want of reticulated sur- 

 face so peculiar to that species. Bears some resemblance, to M. bella, Con., 

 but differs in form of outline and aperture, and has no beaded line ; is also 

 more elevated than M. bella. 



M. versipellis, Anthony. Shell small, ovate, folded, rather thin ; spire not 

 elevated, but acute, composed of about 7 flat whorls ; whorls of the spire all 

 more or less folded, penult and body whorl smooth : body whorl bulbous, sub- 

 angulated, concentrically striate ; color olivaceous, ornamented with dark 

 brown bands, of which four are on the body whorl and one only on the spiral 

 ones, located upon or near the shoulder of each volution : aperture elliptical, 

 about half the length of the shell, banded within. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cabinet ; Cab. H. Cuming. 



Obs. A small and somewhat variable species as to coloration, though very 

 constant in other characters; it is sometimes very dark both as to bands and 

 general color, and often very light with bands scarcely distinguishable and 

 many varieties between ; it seems not to be a very common species. 



M. cognata, Anthony. Shell ovate, short, smooth, moderately thick ; spire 

 obtusely elevated, consisting of 56 convex whorls ; color brownish-yellow 

 with three dark brown bands about the middle of the body whorl, and one 

 very obscure one at the suture ; suture deeply impressed ; aperture broad-

 dented and callous; sinus none. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cab. ; Cab. H. Cuming; A. N. S., Philada. 



Obs. A short, pretty species, with no very marked characters, though easily 

 recognised as distinct on examination ; in form and coloring somewhat like 

 M. co?npac(a, nobis, but far less solid and heavy than that species ; the spire is 

 more elevated and acute and the surface smoother. It most nearly resembles, 

 perhap3, M. coronilla, nobis, but is less elevated and has not the peculiar 

 crowning ribs of that species, which is sufficient at once to distinguish it. It is 

 also more robust. 



M. corneola, Anthony. Shell small, conical, rather thin ; spire short and not 

 very acute, composed of five or six subconvex whorls ; whorls all more or less 

 folded and with revolving raised striae which give them a subnodulous appear- 

 ance ; the body whorl has four or five faint bands which appear also within 

 the aperture ; aperture small, ovate, sinus small. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. This is a small and not very remarkable species, nor can it well be 

 compared with any other. One is at first view forcibly reminded of Columbella 

 avara, Say, which it resembles both in size and general appearance. The 

 bands alluded to are often interrupted and never very fully expressed ; body 

 whorl subangulated below the middle ; does not seem to be a very abundant 

 species. Only six individuals are before me. 



M. grata, Anthony. Shell conic, elevated, smooth, thick; whorls 9, flat, 

 terminating in an acute apex, the first three or four whorls being carinated ; 

 color light greenish-yellow, ornamented by a single dark band on the spiral 

 whorls, and four similar bands on the body whorl, giving the shell a truly 

 lively and beautiful appearance ; sutures very distinct ; aperture ovate, banded 

 within ; columella deeply indented and curved at base, where there is a small 

 but rather broad sinus. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. The colors in this species are finely contrasted, and the general ap- 

 pearance is very lively and pleasing: the bands on the body whorl are not 

 uniformly distributed, the upper and lower ones being widely separated, while 

 the central ones are very close together and less distinct. Altogether it is one 

 of our most beautiful species. 



M. germana, Anthony. Shell carinate on the body whorl ; form rhombic ; 

 substance rather thin ; varying in color from ash grey to dark brown ; whorls 

 six, upper ones smooth ; suture very distinct ; aperture rhombic, within 

 brownish, with a white area near the outer edge ; columella rounded or angu- 

 larly indented, slightly callous ; sinus small. 



Hab. Cahawba River, Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. This is another of the short, rhombic species, which are represented 

 most fitly by M. rhombica, nob., and includes M. angulata, nob., M. cubicoides, 

 nob., M. crislata, nob., and many others. From M. rhombica, it differs in being 

 shorter and less slender, and by wanting the regular concentric striae so con- 

 spicuous on the upper half of that species ; it is also less slender than M. angu- 

 lata, nob., and more solid. From all other species it may readily be distin- 

 guished. 



M. grisea, Anthony. Shell ovate, smooth, thick, of a dull grey color ; 

 whorls 7, convex; sutures very distinct; body whorl obscurely ribbed, and 

 having two or three inconspicuous bands revolving around it ; aperture large, 

 ovate, banded within ; columella deeply indented, with a white callus, unusu- 

 ally thickened at the summit of aperture ; sinus broad but not distinct.

obscure, scarcely perceptible, and those within the aperture are arrested before 

 reaching the edge of the lip. The ribs which are inconspicuous on the spire 

 become more decided on the body whorl, and sometimes appear as varices 

 there ; the spire is very obtusely elevated. 



M. iostoma, Anthony. Shell ovate-conic, smooth ; spire obtusely elevated ; 

 whoils about six, subconvex ; body whorl exhibiting uncommonly strong lines 

 of growth, curved and varicose ; color greenish olive, shining ; sutures dis- 

 tinct ; body whorl strongly but not sharply angulated on the middle ; aperture 

 broad-ovate, within light purple, which becomes very deep on the columella, 

 which is regularly rounded : outer lip somewhat produced, and having a well 

 developed sinus at base. 



Hab. Tennessee.

Obs. This species approaches nearest in form and color to M. fflans, nob., 

 now changed to glandula, from which it diiFers in being less globular, of a 

 lighter color generally, and by the angulated body whorl. Compared with M. 

 pinguis, Lea, it is less obese, more elongate, and has not the rapidly attenuat- 

 ing spire of that species. From all others it is readily distinguished. 



M. intkrtexta, Anthony. Shell conical, acute, and highly elevated ; whorls 

 about ten, each strongly ribbed longitudinally and furnished also with revolv- 

 ing stria;, which becoming more elevated near the suture, arrest the ribs at that, 

 point ; sutures decidedly impressed ; aperture pyriform, not large, whitish 

 within ; columella slightly rounded, not indented ; sinus distinct, but small.

Obs. A very abundant species. About two hundred specimens are now be- 

 fore me, and present characters remarkably uniform. May be compared with 

 M. bella, Conrad, but differs by its more elongate and sharply elevated form ; its 

 ribs are more decided, and it has not the bead-like prominences, so common in 

 M. bella, and kindred species. From M. arachnoidea, nob., it may be distin- 

 guished by its less elongate but more acute form, difference of aperture and 

 less number of whorls; the striae revolve around the whorls and over the folds 

 without being arrested by them, giving the surface a woven appearance : hence 

 its name. 



M. rigida, Anthony. Shell conic, elevate, carinate, rather thin ; whorls 8 9, 

 carinate and banded ; sutures distinctly marked ; aperture small, elliptical, 

 whitish within ; columella indented ; sinus small but very distinct.

Obs. This is one of those sharply keeled Melanice of which 31. bella, Con., M. 

 carino-costata and 31. oblita, Lea, may be considered good examples. The 

 whorls of the spire have each two carinas, with generally a dark band between 

 them, though this is sometimes wanting ; the body whorl has four or five of 

 these, carinre and generally two bands, one of which revolves within the aper- 

 ture. To the touch this species has a peculiarly rough feel. 



M. gracillima, Anthony. Shell conic, thin, brownish ; spire very slender, 

 elevated, composed of eight convex whorls, the upper ones folded and striate, 

 the lower ones smooth, the striae being replaced by indistinct, slender, brown 

 lines ; sutures very deeply impressed, a sharp carina on the lower portion of 

 each whorl, rendering them quite distinct ; aperture small, ovate, banded in- 

 side ; columella indented ; sinus small. 



Hab. South Carolina.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 63 



Obs. A peculiarly slender, graceful species, in form somewhat like 31. strigosa, 

 Lea, but more folded and more slender. The striae on the upper whorls are 

 very distinct where they intersect the folds, and give the shell a tuberculous 

 appearance ; the folds are arrested by the carina, which is elevated. The brown 

 lines on the body whorl are often slightly elevated, but nevertheless, indistinct, 

 and are about four in number. A faint line or band of a yellow color revolves 

 around the upper portion of the two lower whorls. 



Gyrotoma. 



As some confusion exists regarding the name of this genus, the following 

 notes are given : 



The genus Melatoma was established by Swainson, and first given to the 

 world in 1840, in his "Treatise on Shells and Shell Fishes," published in 

 London, founded, as he says, (p. 202,) " upon a remarkable Ohio shell sent 

 him many years before by his old friend Prof. Rafinesque." "It has," he 

 remarks, " the general form of a Pleurotoma and of a Melafusus, with a well- 

 defined sinus or cleft near the top of the outer lip, while the inner, though 

 thin, is somewhat thickened above." The other characters named by him are 

 such as are generally considered rather specific than generic, and the pleuro- 

 toma-like cut in the outer lip as applied to a fluviatile univalve is altogether 

 sufficient to indicate the new genus. The specimen alluded to by Swainson, 

 and from which his generic description was drawn, was an imperfect one, and 

 the species has not since been identified by American naturalists. This is less 

 to be wondered at when we consider how very local the genus has always been, 

 and how few specimens have found their way into our collections. The waters 

 of Alabama have as yet monopolized this interesting genus, and it is probable 

 that even there it is confined almost, if not quite, exclusively to the Coosa and 

 its tributaries. 



On p. 342 Swainson gives the following generic description, adding a figure : 



" Fusiform, longitudinally ribbed ; a deep sinus at the top of the outer lip ; 

 base contracted, channel wide." 



Mr. Swainson's figure is quite unsatisfactory. His genus Melatoma is referred 

 doubtfully to Clionella by H. and A. Adams, and has not prevailed for this 

 genus in America or Europe. I have therefore decided not to make use of it 

 in this case. 



Subsequently this genus has been noticed by various authors, and other 

 names have been applied to it. In 1841 or 1842, Dr. J. W. Mighels sent me 

 specimens of one species under the name of Apella scissura; but his generic 

 name was never published, and his species, if not identical with any which Mr. 

 Lea afterwards described, seems to have been overlooked and forgotten. 



On the 14th of December, 1842, Mr. Lea read a paper before the American 

 Philosophical Society, in which he describes Melania excisa and Anculosa incisa. 

 In his remarks upon these species he alludes to the pleurotomose cut in the 

 superior part of the upper lip, and at the same time suggests the possibility of 

 its being necessary, in consequence of that character, to construct a new genus, 

 which he proposed to call " Schizostoma." Mr. Lea finding his name " Schizos- 

 toma" preoccupied in Palaeontology, changed it to " Schizochilus." (March 5, 

 1852, Obs. v. p. 51.) In a paper read May 2d, 1845, Mr. Lea, in a foot-note to 

 page 93, first indicates the generic characters of Schizostoma as follows : 

 "Testa vel conica vel fusiformis ; labrum superne fissura; apertura ovata; 

 columella lsevis, incurva;" and describes six additional species. 



In the above concise definition of the genus it will at once be noted that the 

 fissure at the upper part of the outer lip is after all the essential character ; and 

 Mr. Lea himself seems to be aware of this, since of the six species then described 

 he states the aperture to be elliptical in five cases and rhomboidal in the other, 

 although his generic character is "aperture ovate;" indeed in the species 

 described by him but a single one has the aperture ovate, and that one is 

 described as an Anculosa. 



I860.] 




64 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



It may be doubted whether Mr. Lea's first name will not eventually prevail, 

 since, before he published Schizostoma, Bronn's genus of the same name 

 (Lethea Geogn. i. 95, 1835-1837), had been called a synonym of Bifrontia 

 (Omalaxis) of Deshayes. {Vide Desh. in Lam. ix. p. 104.) Indeed, H. and A. 

 Adams (Gen. Rec. Moll. i. 305) do not appear correct in giving preference to 

 Gyrotoma over Schizostoma, Lea, on account of Schizostoma, Bronn, since (on 

 p. 244) the latter name is placed in the synonymy of Omalaxis. 



Another generic name Schizostoma is quoted in Hermannsen's Index. I have 

 not obtained access to the work containing this description, but its date is said 

 to be anterior to Mr. Lea's description. 



Mr. Lea's second name, Schizochilus, had previously been used in Coleoptera 

 but withdrawn before Mr. Lea's description was published. 



Mr. Shuttleworth, in July, 1845, (Mittheilungen der Naturforschenden Ge- 

 sellschaft in Bern, p. 88,) gives another description of the genus under the 

 name of Gyrotoma, founded on two species from the Coosa River, description? 

 of which are also given. 



The generic name of Mr. Shuttleworth has been adopted in H. and A. Adams' 

 Genera of Recent Mollusca (i. p. 305, Feb., 1854.) 



Dr. Gray also (Guide to Mollusca, i. p. 103, 1857) adopts Shuttleworth's 

 name. 



Such being the confused state of the synonymy of the genus, we have decided 

 to adopt, at least temporarily, the earliest name concerning which no doubt 

 exists. 



Only about ten species of this genus have as yet been published, eight of 

 which are by Mr. Lea in 1842 and 1845, since which time few specimens have 

 been collected, and but two new species added. I now propose to add descrip- 

 tions of nine new species to the number already known, in one of which, " G. 

 salebrosa," we note a character not hitherto observed, except in what was per- 

 haps the original type of the genus, viz., a nodulous coronation upon or near 

 the suture, which nodules by lateral compression assume the form of folds or 

 plaits, thus approximating the longitudinal ribs of Gyrotoma costata, Swainson. 

 Gyrotoma bulbosa, nob., herein described, also exhibits this character, though 

 far less decidedly; and as specimens become more common, we may hope to 

 re-discover the original type so long unknown. 



Gyrotoma kecta, Anthony. Shell smooth, cylindrical, yellowish, thick ; 

 spire short, originally furnished with about 5 low whorls, of which 3 are nearly 

 lost by truncation ; fissure moderately broad, not quite direct and not re- 

 markably deep ; sutures lightly impressed ; aperture narrow ovate, occupying 

 about 3-5ths of the length of the shell; within dusky and obscurely banded ; 

 columella callous, thickened abruptly at the fissure.

06s. This is the most cylindrical species I have ever seen in this genus. 

 In its general form and coloring it most nearly resembles G. demissa, nob., but 

 is longer, more elevated, smoother, and is ornamented with bands, which on 

 that species are entirely wanting ; these bands on the body whorl are three in 

 number, of which the middle one is the narrowest and least distinct ; they are 

 widely distant from each other ; the cord-like cincture is very prominent in 

 this species and the fissure is farther removed from the suture than is usual . 

 It is altogether a beautiful and graceful species. 



Gyrotoma demissa, Anthony. Shell short, robust, thick, truncate, of a 

 dark horn color ; spire flat by truncation, exhibiting traces of about four 

 whorls ; body whorl cylindrical ; .fissure broad, waved, and rather deep : 

 aperture elliptical, within whitish ; columella thickened along its whole ex- 

 tent, but most so at the fissure.

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 65 



06s. A fine cylindrical species, whose chief characteristics are its very 

 smooth, polished surface, plain russet color, and flat, truncate spire ; the 

 lines of growth are unusually strong in this species, and the darker lines in- 

 dicating the terminus of previous mouths are very distinct and numerous, 

 evidencing frequent and many pauses in its growth ; the columella is much 

 bent near its base, and a narrow but distinct sinus is formed at about the mid- 

 dle space between the outer lip and columella. A single specimen only is be- 

 fore me, but seems so very distinct from all others that I have no hesitation in 

 considering it new. 



Gykotoma quadrata, Anthony. Shell short, smooth, fusiform, rather thick, 

 olivaceous; spire short, composed of about 4 very low whorls, the upper two 

 being partially obliterated by erosion ; fissure rather broad, waved, but not 

 remarkably deep ; sutures distinct ; whorls distinctly but not squarely 

 shouldered ; aperture elliptical, occupying more than half the length of the 

 shell ; within 3 banded ; columella with a light callous deposit. 



Length of shell 9-16 in. Length of aperture 6-16 in. Breadth of shell 7-16 

 in. Breadth of aperture 3-16 in. 



Hab. Coosa River, Alabama. My Cabinet ; Cab. H. Cuming, London. 



Obs. The most remarkable characteristic at first view of this species is its 

 short, square form ; its color is dark, and the bands which are very broad are 

 not very distinct; hence its general aspect is not so pleasing to the eye as many 

 others ; the fissure is broadly separated from the body of the shell, outer lip 

 very sharp and sinuous, forming, with the columella, a small not very distinct 

 sinus at base. In form it approaches most nearly perhaps to G. salebrosa, nob., 

 but is more delicate in texture, thinner, and has no armature as in that 

 species. 



Gykotoma bulbosa, Anthony. Shell striate, ovate, moderately thick, dark 

 olive ; spire obtusely elevated, subtruncate, 4 whorls only remaining ; whorls 

 of the spire subconvex ; sutures very distinct, rendered more so by the 

 shouldering of the whorls ; body whorl inflated, subangulated a little below 

 the suture, from which angle it shelves towards it, and having 2 or 3 dark, 

 broad bands revolving round it ; lines of growth curved and very distinct, al- 

 most like crowded ribs ; fissure perfectly strait, very narrow and not deep ; 

 aperture rather long, of a dusky color within and ornamented by 3 broad and 

 distinct bands there ; columella smooth, except at the lower part, where it is 

 slightly thickened.

 Breadth of aperture 3-16 in. 



Hab. Coosa River, Alabama. My Cabinet. 



06s. A short ovate species resembling in some respects G. ovalis, nob., 

 herein described ; it is less elevated than that species, more ventricose, and its 

 surface is rougher ; indeed, there seems to be indications of obscure folds on 

 the body whorl of this species near the suture, which in very old specimens 

 may be more fully expressed, and thus bring it into close affinity with M. sale- 

 brosa, nob. These folds, which were noted by Swainson as a generic character 

 in his original type, and which are wanting in all the species since published, 

 and now re-discovered, are exceedingly interesting in that connexion. 



Gyrotoma ovalis, Anthony. Shell smooth, oval, olivaceous, moderately 

 thick ; spire obtusely elevated, composed of about 5 6 convex whorls, of 

 which 2 are generally lost by truncation ; sutures deeply impressed ; aperture 

 broadly elliptical, banded within ; fissure direct, exceedingly narrow and 

 very deep, extending nearly one half around the shell ; columella slightly 

 curved by a callus.

unusually deep, linear fissure ; the whorls are somewhat shouldered, though 

 not so much so as in many of the species ; the spiral whorls are furnished 

 with two broad bands, one near tbe top of each and the other widely separate 

 and near the succeeding whorl, being often half concealed by it ; there are 3 

 bands on the body whorl equidistant from each other ; compared with G. bul- 

 bosa, nob., which it most nearly resembles, it is longer, more linear, and has 

 not the rapidly attenuating spire of that species nor its roughly striate sur- 

 face. 



Gyrotoma ampla, Anthony. Shell smooth, ovate, rather thick, olivaceous; 

 spire not elevated, but acute ; whorls 6 7, subconvex ; sutures well defined ; 

 fissure broad, rather deep and waved; aperture moderate, elliptical, flesh 

 colored and banded within ; columella smooth, or slightly thickened only at 

 the fissure ; body whorl striate, and banded ; whorls of the spire not banded, 

 but having a thickened cord-like line near the suture.

Hab. Coosa River, Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A fine symmetrical species of this interesting genus which hitherto 

 has not been very productive in species. Compared with Schizostoma funicu- 

 latam, Lea, which it most nearly resembles, it is smoother, thinner, more 

 acute, and has not the double cord-like lines of that species. Most if not all 

 the species of Gyrotoma have the fissure gradually filled up behind as it is 

 pushed forward in the process of growth, by a cord-like line more or less pro- 

 minent, often so much so as to produce quite a shoulder at the suture, and 

 this species is so marked, but it has no cord-like line in the middle of the 

 body whorl as described in funiculatum. 



Gyrotoma salebrosa, Anthony. Shell fusiform, robust, thick, nodulous, of 

 a dusky olive color ; spire truncated, leaving scarcely more than the body 

 whorl, but indicating by traces on the truncation the loss of three or four 

 others ; fissure moderately open, waved, not deep ; body whorl, roughly nodu- 

 lous at the upper part and ornamented by three dark bands below ; aperture 

 ample, ovate, dusky within and bounded with three broad bands ; columella 

 deeply rounded, covered with a thick deposit of callus, white at its lower por- 

 tion, but tinged with dark brown at the fissures.

Obs. This species presents the unusual characteristic of a nodulous surface, 

 which character has not been observed in any species hitherto described by 

 any American author. These nodules are very conspicuous and much com- 

 pressed laterally, so as to present very much the appearance of coarsely folded 

 ribs, thus furnishing a close approximation to the original type from which 

 Swainson formed the genus ; on this account it becomes exceedingly interest- 

 ing, as indicating great variety in the specific forms of this genus, giving 

 assurance that among the many varied forms yet to be discovered we may at 

 last find the identical species sent by Rafinesque to Swainson. These com- 

 pressed nodules will at once distinguish it from all other species. 



Gyrotoma carinifera, Anthony. Shell conic, thick, dark brown ; spire 

 obtusely elevated, truncate, though not abruptly so, six whorls remain, one 

 or two having apparently been lost by truncation ; carinations elevated, sub- 

 acute and found on all the whorls, two on each of the spiral ones and three to 

 four on the body whorl ; fissure direct, broad, and moderately deep, extending 

 about l-5th around the shell ; sutures irregular, much modified by the carinae, 

 and often concealed in part by them ; aperture ovate and banded within ; 

 columella much rounded, callous at the lower part only ; outer lip irregularly 

 waved, its outline modified by the carina? on the body whorl. No sinus.

Obs. This species cannot well be confounded with any other yet described. 

 In general form and in its armature one is very forcibly reminded of Melania 

 annuli/era, Con., from which it differs, however, not only generically, but by 

 its more ovate base ; the carinas are lighter in color than the general body of 

 the shell, and are slightly irregular or sub-nodulous in outline ; it is a stout, 

 heavy species, and has a smaller aperture proportionally than is common in 

 the genus ; the bands within the aperture are five in number, very dark, and 

 the three central ones are disposed to be confluent ; a dark broad band revolves 

 around the base of the shell. Compared with Schizoztoma pagoda, Lea, it 

 differs in color, in its more elongate form, and by tne character of its carina?, 

 which are more uniform, the main variation being that they are more diffused 

 on the whorl, whereas, in Mr. Lea's species they are particularly conspicuous 

 near the apex. 



Gykotoma robdsta, Anthony. Shell fusiform, robust, thick, of a dark olive 

 color ; spire obtuse, consisting of one perfect whorl remaining, with marks of 

 two or three more, lost by truncation ; body whorl broad, ornamented by three 

 obscure, dark, wide bands ; fissure rather broad, curved, not deep, closed 

 behind by a cordlike cincture, very prominent, beneath which and close to it 

 is a narrow depression or furrow ; aperture narrow, ovate, banded inside ; 

 columella well rounded and covered by callus ; lines of growth very distinct 

 and much curved, rendering the shell rough by their prominence. 



Length of shell J in. Breadth of shell 9-16. Length of aperture 10-16. 

 Breadth of aperture 5-6. 



Hab. Coosa River, Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. This is a large, robust species, somewhat resembling Melania ampla, 

 nob. in form, and not unlike it in coloring ; it is about the largest species I 

 have seen in this genus, and certainly not the least beautiful ; compared with 

 G. salebrosa, nob., herein described, it is larger, smoother, more inflated, and 

 has not the rib-like prominences so characteristic of that species ; the lower 

 part of the columella is somewhat flattened and thickened, and another thick- 

 ening takes place at the aperture, leaving a thinner space between the two 

 points. 



Anculosa oknata, Anthony. Shell conic, rather thick, smooth ; spire ele- 

 vated, composed of about five convex whorls ; suture distinct ; color dark 

 yellow, polished, with dark brown bands revolving around the shell ; three 

 bands visible on the body whorl and only one upon the volutions of the spire ; 

 aperture ovate, livid and banded within ; columella furnished with a callus, 

 often tinted with rose color ; sinus very small. 



Hab. North Carolina. My Cabinet ; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London ; A. N. S., 

 Phila.; State Coll., Alb., N. Y.; Smithsonian Collection. 



06s. A fine species, so much elevated as readily to be taken for a Melania ; 

 the dark bands on a yellow ground give it a lively appearance ; about one 

 hundred specimens are before me, and present very little variation ; the dark 

 bands within the aperture are very conspicuous, one being near the upper 

 angle, two others near each other, but widely separated from the first, and a 

 fourth near the base of the shell ; the middle bands are often confluent, and 

 all of them are arrested by a broad area before they reach the outer edge. 



Anculosa ligata, Anthony. Shell ovate, smooth, of a dark green color, 

 rather thick ; spire obtusely elevated, composed of about four whorls ; suture 

 very distinct ; upper whorls flattened, body whorl constricted at the middle, 

 banded ; aperture ovate, banded within ; columella deeply indented, callous ; 

 no sinus at base.

 State Coll., Albany, N. Y.; Smithsonian Collection. 



Obs. This species, of which I have some twenty or thirty individuals before 

 me, seems remarkably constant in character for an Anculosa, and not readily 

 mistaken for any other ; its color, which is a dirty dark green, is but poorly 

 relieved by the faint bands on the whorl ; nevertheless, it is an interesting 

 species, and one which will always attract attention; its most prominent 

 character is the constriction on the body whorl, which gives the appearance of 

 a cord having been drawn tightly around it while in a yielding state. 



Anculosa corpulenta, Anthony. Shell ovate or broad ovate, smooth, 

 thick ; spire rather elevated ; composed of 4-6 subconvex whorls ; suture 

 decidedly impressed ; aperture very broad, ovate, ample, banded inside ; col- 

 umella well rounded, slightly covered with white callus, and with a slight in- 

 dication of sinus at base. 



Bab. North Carolina. My Cabinet ; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London ; A. N. S., 

 Philada.; State Coll. Albany, N. Y.; Smithsonian Collec, Washington, D. C. 



Obs. Cannot well be confounded with any of its congeners ; it is unusually 

 elevated for an Anculosa, resembling more a Paludina in that respect ; the 

 whorls are regularly but not abruptly shouldered, and are often excavated 

 with a narrow channel at the middle ; striae and even indistinct carinae are 

 often visible, but are not a constant character ; the bands within the aperture 

 are not always well defined and are sometimes wanting altogether ; when 

 present they are generally five in number, and are arrested by a narrow white 

 space at the outer lip ; body whorl often subangulated. 



Occurs in Dan river, North Carolina, in company with Anculosa canalifera, 

 nob., and appears to be very common. Several hundred specimens of various 

 ages are now before me. 



Anculosa canalifera, Anthony. Shell ovate, costate, of a brown color, thin ; 

 spire acutely elevated, composed of 5 6 sharply carinate whorls ; suture not 

 very distinct ; aperture about half the length of the shell, ovate, banded in- 

 side ; columella deeply indented ; sinus none. 



Hab. North Carolina, in Dan river. 



My Cabinet; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London; A. N. S., Phila.; State Coll., 

 Albany, N. Y.; Smithsonian Coll., Washington, D. C. 



Obs. One of our most curious and beautiful species, which no one can easily 

 mistake ; the whole shell is crossed with sharp, elevated costae running around 

 the whorls and corresponding deep grooves between them ; about five costae on 

 the body whorl ; a less number on the spire volutions ; these ribs appear as 

 dark bands in the interior of the aperture, and there is a broad non-elevated 

 band at the base of the shell ; differs from Anc. costata, nob., by the size and 

 prominence of its ribs and by its elevated spire. 



Anculosa viridula, Anthony. Shell ovate, of a uniform dark green color, 

 rather thin ; spire much elevated, composed of 4 5 convex whorls ; sutures 

 very distinct ; aperture ovate, large, about half the length of the shell, livid 

 inside ; columella well rounded ; has a broad but not well defined sinus. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cabinet ; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London ; A. N. S., 

 Philada.; Smithsonian Coll., Washington, D. C. 



Obs. In form and coloring this species resembles Paludina decisa, Say, when 

 that is about half grown, and but for its operculum one would hardly deem it 

 an Anculosa; it is a plain, unadorned species, not liable to be confounded with 

 any other ; its body whorl is large and subangulated ; lines of growth well 

 defined and close ; it has a slight disposition to shouldering at the suture ; it 

 is not an abundant species so far as at present known. 



Anculosa patula, Anthony. Shell ovate, of an uniform dark horn color, 

 rather thin ; whorls 4 5, convex ; sutures very distinct ; aperture semicircu-

 a callous deposit, more or less tinged with dirty red. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cab. ; Cab .Hugh Cuming, London ; A. N. S., Phila-

Obs, Resembles none other of the genus ; its color, which is of a dull dark 

 brown, and its semicircular mouth, remarkable for its length and bre idth, are 

 prominent marks of distinction ; the body whorl is very much inflated and 

 angulated or subangulated ; the interior aperture is often blotched with ir- 

 regular, dirty brown spots ; spire elevated and acute, rapidly diminishing to 

 the apex ; the lines of growth are strong, and on some specimens a single 

 prominent varix may be noticed. % 



Anculosa elegans, Anthony. Shell subglobose, smooth, thick ; spire de- 

 pressed, consisting of 3 4 flat whorls ; color fine glossy dark yellow, orna- 

 mented with darker bands, of which five are on the body whorl ; aperture 

 obliquely ovate and banded within ; columella deeply curved, with a heavy 

 callous deposit ; sinus very small. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A highly ornamental species, which cannot be compared with any 

 other ; its bands on a yellow ground render it very lively ; it is heavier and 

 smoother than A. ampla, nobis, not so broad in the aperture and far more 

 beautiful ; neither is it so much shouldered as that species. 



Anculosa zebra, Anthony. Shell subglobose, smooth, moderately thick ; 

 spire obtusely elevated, but slightly decorticated, and composed of four convex 

 whorls ; sutures distinctly impressed ; aperture broad, ovate, within bluish, 

 with the epidermal colors seen faintly through ; columella rounded, covered 

 with callus, which is thickened at the upper part. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. This species presents an appearance not often seen in the genus, by 

 its mottled, variegated epidermis ; the general ground color is gamboge yel- 

 low, but it is varied by blotches of very dark brown or reddish, often running 

 into diagonal lines, which gives the shell a very lively and pleasant look. 

 Only one other species is described as being similarly marked, viz., A.flam- 

 raata, Lea ; that species I have never seen, but the description does not war- 

 rant me in considering the two identical. 



In old specimens the spire is often produced and somewhat nodulous, while 

 the longitudinal bands become broken into irregular lines, so interrupted as 

 to become scarcely more than quadrangular spots ; it is one of our most beau- 

 tiful species. About a dozen specimens are before me. 



Io turrita, Anthony. -Shell conic, elevated, horn colored, spinous ; spines 

 rather short and heavy, about seven on each whorl ; whorls nine ; aperture 

 pyriform, about one-third the length of the shell, and irregularly banded 

 within ; columella rounded, slightly twisted and forming a short, narrow 

 canal at base. 



Length of shell 2% in. Breadth of shell | in. Length of aperture in. 

 Breadth of aperture 7-16 inch. 



Hab. Tennessee. 



Obs. This is the most slender and elongate species of this genus which has 

 come under my notice, and although a single specimen only has as yet been 

 discovered, its claims to rank as a species will hardly be questioned ; its long, 

 slender form, stout, closely set spines, and small aperture will at once dis- 

 tinguish it from its congeners ; two faint bands traverse each whorl, one of 

 which lies precisely in the plane of the spines ; lines of growth very distinct, 

 nearly varicose. 



Io brevis, Anthony. Shell conic, ovate, horn colored, spinous ; spines 

 short, thick, five on each whorl ; whorls about seven ; aperture elliptical or 

 pyriform, one-half the length of the shell ; collumella rounded and sinuous

06s. Another of the short, heavy forms in this genus, so unlike the normal 

 type of Io spinosa ; we think no one need confound it with any other species ; 

 its short, heavy, flattened spines jutting out like so many miniature spear 

 heads and its peculiarly twisted columella will readily characterize it. The 

 columella is also covered with a dense callous deposit, increased in thickness 

 at its upper part, and often blotched with dark red at that point ; irregular, 

 ill defined, but broad bands are seen in the interior, often faintly visible on 

 the epidermis. Appears to be a rather common species in some localities, of 

 which I possess some hundreds of specimens. 



Io inermis, Anthony. Shell couical, smooth, thick ; moderately elevated, 

 composed of 7 8 flattened whorls ; suture very distinct ; upper whorls slight- 

 ly coronated by an obscure row of low spines nearly concealed by the pre- 

 ceding whorl ; shell otherwise perfectly smooth or only occasionally or ob- 

 scurely nodulous on the body whorl ; lines of growth very strong and much 

 curved ; aperture pyriform, curved to the left, banded within ; columella 

 twisted, callous, thickened above ; sinus long and curved.

06s. Remarkable mainly for its plain, unadorned exterior and smooth 

 epidermis; its color is also lighter than " spinosa " or " fiuviatilis ". No 

 spines are visible on the body whorl of this species generally, but I have a few 

 specimens which may perhaps belong to it, and which have a few obscure 

 spines near the aperture ; these are, however, little more than knobs. Some 

 hundreds of this species have come under my notice. 



Io spirostoma, Anthony. Shell conical, broadly ovate, horn colored, 

 spinous : spines short, thick, seven to eight on each whorl ; whorls about 

 nine ; aperture ovate, about half the length of the shell ; columella and 

 outer lip much and regularly twisted, and forming a well defined sinus at 

 base.

06s. This is truly a most remarkable species of this highly interesting 

 genus of Mollusks ; its difference from the ordinary type of Io spinosa is too 

 marked to admit of its being confounded with that, or indeed any other 

 species ; its stout, ovate form, short, heavy spines, and, above all, the peculiar 

 and graceful curvature of its outer lip, are prominent characteristics and readily 

 distinguish it. Among several thousand specimens of Io in my possession, 

 but three adult individuals of this species have been noticed, although I have 

 a dozen or more which seem to be immature forms of it ; it may therefore be 

 considered as not only one of the most aberrant and beautiful forms of Io, 

 but also one of the rarest. 



Paludina lima, Anthony. Shell ovate, rather thin, dark green ; spire ob- 

 tusely elevated and composed of six convex whorls, which are strongly striate 

 or suboarinate ; sutures very distinct, and the upper part of each whorl being 

 flattened renders it more conspicuous ; aperture broad-ovate, about half the

Length \\ inches. Breadth J inch. 



Hab. South Carolina. My Cab.; Cab. H. Cuming, London; A. N. S..

Obs. In general form not unlike our We stern P. Integra, Say, from which 

 it differs, however, by its revolving, raised strise and by its carina, which are 

 also well developed ; the lines <>f growth are very strong, and decussating with 

 the stria give the surface a beautifully rough appearance, which suggests its 

 specific name. It is really one of our handsomest species, and so unlike all 

 others that no American species can readily be mistaken for it. In most speci- 

 mens the body whorl is very strongly carinate about the middle, and the outer 

 lip is considerably produced as in P. subsolida, nob. 



Paludina decapitata, Anthony. Shell globular, thin, of a light green color ; 

 spire truncate, but never elevated under any circumstances, composed of 

 about four very flat whorls ; aperture broad, ovate, one-half the length of the 

 shell, within dusky white ; columella regularly but not deeply rounded, with a 

 slight deposit of callous, and having a very small linear umbilicus at base. 



Hab. Tennessee. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A single specimen only is before me, and therefore I claim it as a new 

 species with some hesitation ; it seems to me, however, too unlike any of the 

 ordinary forms in this genus to warrant its being included with any of them ; 

 it is the most globose of any species hitherto published, if we except the small, 

 round forms which were long since removed, and very properly too, to Amni- 

 cola ; the spire is entirely wanting, but traces of the sutures show the number 

 of whorls ; and its present appearance forbids the idea of its ever having had 

 an elevated spire. 



Paludina humerosa, Anthony. Shell ovate, thick, bright green, imper- 

 forate ; spire rather obtusely elevated, composed, of about 5 6 convex whorls : 

 upper whorls smooth, body whorl and preceding one strongly striate and 

 granulate or subgranulate ; sutures very distinct ; aperture ovate, nearly one- 

 half the length of the shell, livid within. 



Length about half an inch. 



Hab. Alabama. My Cabinet. 



Obs. A single specimen only is before me, but it is sufficiently distinct ; its 

 granulated surface and the broad shouldering of the whorls are it- 1 chief char- 

 acteristics ; compared with P. genicula, Con., it is more slender, darker in color, 

 and its granulated surface is of itself a sufficient distinction. 



Paludina exilis, Anthony. Shell turrited, smooth, rather thick ; color 

 light apple green ; spire elevated, composed of about seven volutions ; suture 

 well marked ; aperture small, broad-ovate, livid within ; body whorl distinctly 

 angulated, subumbilicate, and with very distinct lines of growth ; columella 

 well rounded and curved with a callous deposit, connecting perfectly with the 

 outer lip thus forming a continuous rim.

Obs. One of the most slender of our American species ; Paludina subsolida, 

 nob., is more ponderous, more globose, and has a larger aperture ; no other 

 species approaches it in general appearance ; the whorls of this species taper 

 more rapidly to an acute apex than in most of the species ; compared with P. 

 Integra, Say, it is more slender, more solid, and the aperture is much smaller. 



Paludina subsolida, Anthony. Shell ovate, imperforate, very thick ; co'or 

 light green, verging to brown in old specimens ; spire much elevated, com- 

 posed of 6 7 inflated whorls ; sutures very distinct ; aperture broad-ovate,

 rounded, a thick callous deposit covering the umbilicus. 



Length 2 inches ; breadth lj inches. 



Hub. Illinois. My Cab. ; Cab. Hugh Cuming, London. 



Obs. This is the most ponderous species in the genus, far exceeding P. 

 ponderosa, Say, in that respect ; compared with that species it is not only 

 much more solid and heavy, but its spire is proportionally more elongate, 

 whorls more convex, while the body whorl is less ventricose, and the aperture 

 is uncommonly small for a Paludina of its size ; the body whorl is disposed to 

 be angulated near its middle ; all the whorls are more or less shouldered and 

 the lines of growth are very conspicuous ; the body whorl is obscurely striate 

 concentrically, and its surface then- by modified so as to present* a faintly sculp- 

 tured appearance, and the striae being somewhat finely undulated the appear- 

 ance under a microscope is very pleasing.

 doubtless the result of accident or mistake.

Our specimen differs from those described by Prof. Jan with respect to the 

 number of gastrosteges included in the black rings. In those the central ring 

 covers but one plate ; in ours, four, the lateral ones six or seven. The great 

 breadth of these rings compared with the light spaces, distinguishes it at once 

 from any other species which we have seen. The muzzle is short, and the 

 nostrils widely separated. Total length 11 inches. Gastrosteges 181, anal 1, 

 urosteges 27. 



P. 346, species 51. A more careful examination of the two specimens here 

 assigned, with a mark of doubt, to Elaps Marcgravii, has convinced us 

 that neither of them belong to that species, and that they are in fact distinct 

 from each other. The smaller we believe to be undescribed. After fili- 

 form i s Gthr. it is the most slender South American Elaps. Upon comparing 

 it with a young E. lemniscatus, which has a head of the same size, the 

 proportions of the body and tail are nearly similar, but the number of sets of 

 rings is rather less. The head is not so broad posteriorly, and the occipital 

 plates are a little more elongate. The principal difference, however, lies in the 

 distribution of colors on the head. This is entirely black above and below as 

 far as three scales behind the occipitals, except a yellow band behind the post- 

 oculars. This covers the sixth upper labial, one temj>oral above it, anterior 

 third of the occipitals, hinder edge of superciliaries, and greater part of the 

 vertical. Superior labials seven, third and fourth coming into the orbit. 

 Distance from the black of the head to first ring, eleven scales. Eight sets of 

 rings, the middle not twice as wide as the external ring, which is as broad as 

 the yellow interval. Gastrosteges 197 ; anal 1 ; urosteges 19 pair. Length 11 

 in. 9 1. 



We propose calling this species Elaps melanogenys. 



One specimen, presented by Dr. Wilson ; locality unknown. 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 73 



E. Gravenhorstii Jan, loc. cit. p. 524, resembles this species, but has 

 a black half-collar only, and a longer tail. The preocular is very small, sepa- 

 rated from the nasal by the contiguous post-frontal and superior labial. In 

 our species the preocular is unusually large, and in contact with the nasal. 



Species 53. The three specimens here referred to frontalis D. B. belong 

 to a species nearly allied to lemniscatus, apparently undescribed. The 

 most prominent differences are, the exact equality of the black rings in width, 

 the shorter intervals between the triads, and the position of the first ring 

 which touches the occipital and last labial shields. In lemniscatus, its 

 vars. frontalis and baliocoryphus, in Marcgravii and deco- 

 ra t u s , the first black ring is several scales behind the angle of the mouth, 

 the intermediate space being red ; also the central ring of each three is wider 

 than the external. Distance between the middle and outer of the three rings 

 in our specimens of lemniscatus two and three scales ; inisozonus 

 (as we now call this serpent) four. In the former the anterior part of the 

 occipitals is crossed by a black band ; in the latter they are entirely white, 

 (red ?), except a little black at the posterior ends. 



E. isozonus nob. Sets of rings twelve. No. 1, gastrosteges 201 ; anal 1, 

 entire ; urosteges 28, first 9 entire. No. 2, 218 ; anal 1, divided ; urosteges 26. 

 No. 3, 213 gastrosteges ; anal 1, divided ; urosteges, 29, two entire. We do 

 not know the part of South America inhabited by this serpent. 



Species 54. The specimen here described as Elaps baliocoryphus is, 

 as we now believe, a variety of the lemniscatits. It resembles the figure 

 of the var. frontalis D. $ B. ("Marcgravii" Pr. Max.) in Abbild. 

 Naturgeschichte Brasiliens, differing in having an additional red (white) band 

 across the fronts of the occipitals. Whether Marcgravii D. $ B. be a 

 variety of lemniscatus, as believed by Dr. Giinther, or not, the latter is 

 certainly liable to great variation in the distribution of colors on the head. 



In place of E. baliocoryphus, insert 



54. E. filiformis Giinther, Proc. Z. S.1859, p. 86. 



The head of our specimen is so badly mutilated that the characters could 

 not be made out without difficulty. We are, however, much gratified to be 

 able to record our probable possession of the interesting species described as 

 above. It may be known from other American Elapses by its excessively 

 elongate form and the possession of but one postocular. In a few particulars 

 it differs from Dr. Giinther's description. The nasal plates are two : two tem- 

 porals bound the upper border of the sixth labial shield, the anterior of which 

 reaches the postocular. There is no light-colored band across the post-frontals. 

 Triads of rings nineteen, disposed as in the description. 



Preocular acute anteriorly, just touching the nasals ; hence the post-frontals 

 are bent down, and almost reach the labials. Third, fourth and fifth superior 

 labials narrow and high, eye resting on the suture of the last two. Gastros- 

 teges 308 ; anal 1, divided ; urosteges 42. Length 21 in. 9 1.

 the Boas, having a prehensile character. A comparison of the caudal verte- 

 brae of this serpent and the Hydrophis pelamidoides shows the follow- 

 ing differences : In the latter the neural spines are slender and greatly 

 elongated, and the pleurapophysesf slender, elongated, and but little di- 

 verging. The "appendages" of the latter, which in all serpents appear in 

 the last dorsal and first caudal vertebrae, and are doubtless the homologues of 

 the re-verted processes on the ribs of birds, partake of the same nature. 

 The hypapophyses are similar to those of the dorsal vertebras, being undi- 

 vided, with the exception of those upon the first two vertebrae, whose pleura- 

 pophyses are destitute of the appendage. These are slightly bifid. 



In the Chersydrus the structure is entirely that of the Colubers. The neural 

 spines are short and compressed ; the pleurapophyses short and diverging ; 

 and the hypapophyses bifid, and their lateral moieties separated. Thus in 

 addition the difference in the armature of the mouth, the structure of the tail 

 separates this genus from the sea snakes. Its position appears to us to be 

 between the Homalopsinse and Boidae, connected to the latter by Xenoder- 

 mu s Reinwt., as indicated by Dumeril and Bibron.

 front to nine or ten behind the anus, are marked each with a small recurved 

 tubercle near the anterior border. Anal shield entire. Superior labials six, last 

 largest ; the eye resting on the fourth. Inferior labials five. Posterior pair of 

 geneial shields separated by a central complementary plate. Head shields simi- 

 lar to those of A. brachyorrhos, except that the occipitals are more 

 rounded posteriorly, and the lower postoculars larger. Gastrosteges 135, 1

 length 8 in. 21. Tail 1 in. 



Coloration. Upper surface of head and body deep brown, becoming lighter 

 on the third and fourth longitudinal rows of scales, and contracted on the tail 

 to a narrow median vitta. A blackish brown band passing through the eye,

and along the adjacent edges of the scales of the second and third rows, 

 indistinct on the sides, but distinct on the tail. Superior labials and throat 

 yellowish ; belly grayish, largely varied with black, which forms an irregular 

 longitudinal band. 



This is a more robust serpent than the well-known brachyorrhos, and 

 has a shorter and thicker tail. While this has 21 urosteges, our specimen of 

 the other has 32. The latter has the scales in 17 rows (15 Gimther), and 

 they are more elongate and imbricate ; it has not the supplementary geneial 

 plate, and above all, the peculiar tuberculation of the ischiadic region. This 

 exists elsewhere only as far as we know in the Trachischium r u g o s u m 

 Gthr., of the Himmelayas, also a Calamarian, and is donbtless an assistance 

 to the animals in burrowing in the earth, and among unyielding objects. 



Another difference between this serpent and the brachyorrhos is seen 

 in the less elongated form of the head of the former, the rather shorter labials, 

 and much shorter geneials. The eye, too, is a trifle longer, and more anterior. 

 The coloration is quite different ; we only note here, the absence of the large 

 neck spots in trachyprocta.

We are glad to be able to restore the name given by Dr. Hallowell to this 

 species many years before that of the Erpetologie Generale. The specimen 

 described by him is rather paler than the others justifying the expression, 

 " lead colored." The " six " superior labials is an anomaly, other specimens 

 having seven. None of the specimens have the dark color on the chin and 

 throat mentioned by Dumeril but this is not probably an important character, 

 as Gunther does not allude to it.

72. S. bifasciatus D. fr B. vii. 520. In this species the carina? are 

 very strong, and present on every row of scales. It is of a slender, elongate 

 form as mentioned by its describers, resembling the species of Ablabes in its 

 proportions. For this reason we question the propriety of removing this 

 genus from the neighborhood of Ischnognathus, where Dumeril places it, and 

 it is only the Calamarian form ofS. atratus that induces us to consent to 

 the position assigned by GLinther. Our specimens of species being fresh, we 

 will note : that the superior surface is not properly black, but deep slate ; and 

 that the collar and inferior labial plates are light yellow. The black upon the 

 gastrosteges covers an extent rather wider than each white lateral band.

This genus appears to be quite distinct from Rhabdosoma D. B., be- 

 ing characterized by a more slender body, longer tail, divided anal, and a 

 loreal plate, either united to the postfrontals or wanting. The latter two 

 peculiarities also distinguish it from Rhabdion D. Sf B. Posterior maxil-

This species is accurately described as cited, and the differences between it 

 and T. gracilis pointed out. These, we think, are of specific value, and 

 accordingly name it after Dr. Hallowell, as a slight recognition of his many 

 valuable contributions to herpetology. 



The form of this species is more like that of Haldea s t r i a t u 1 a B. * G., 

 than Carphophiops amoena. The locality, "Indianola, " assigned by 

 Dr. Hallowell, is probably a mistake, being copied from Baird & Girard's 

 Catalogue. We have one specimen brought from Kansas by Dr. Hammond. 



74. T. reticulata nob. Vertical plate broad, slightly angular in front, 

 projecting posteriorly for half its length between the occipitals. Occipitals

 Nostril in the posterior part of prenasal ; postnasal in contact with first and 

 second superior labials, preocular, post- and prefrontals. Two postoculars, 

 upper one in contact posteriorly with the occipital, the lower touching one 

 temporal. A second temporal equal to the first, and a third very small one 

 behind it. Superior labials, seven last largest, third and fourth entering the 

 orbit both low. Four geneials, anterior in contact with inferior rostral. 

 Scales in fifteen rows, last one slightly larger. Gastrosteges 148, postab- 

 dominal 1 divided, urosteges 67 pair. Total length 10 in. 3 1. ; tail 3 in. 



Color above chestnut brown, much darker posteriorly, extending upon the 

 tips of the gastrosteges. Anteriorly the scales are edged with darker, pre- 

 senting a reticulated appearance. Central dorsal row of scales lighter, form- 

 ing a pale vitta, disappearing on the tail. Third and fourth rows on each side 

 also lighter, forming indistinct bands. A collar of the same pale yellow brown 

 crosses the ends of the occipitals. Cephalic plates clouded and edged with 

 darker ; a deep brown mark extending from the occipitals to the mouth across 

 the yellowish labials. Beneath pale yellow, deepening posteriorly.

This species seems to be much like the T. c o r o n a t u m B. $ G., but has 

 a much longer tail, and broader head-shields ; the upper post-ocular, not the

Six superior maxillary teeth on each side in a continuous series, the ante- 

 rior longer than the posterior, but not longer than the middle two. Seven in- 

 ferior maxillaries on each side regularly increasing in length anteriorly. This 

 peculiar dentition induced us to consider this serpent a Lycodont, but sub- 

 sequent examination and comparison with Dr. Giinther's description of his 

 Rhabdosoma maculatum has persuaded us that the two species are 

 very similar, possibly identical. The most material difference is, that the 

 ma cu latum has seven superior labial plates, the fuliginosum six. Of 

 those of the latter, the third is elongated, and with the fourth entering the or- 

 bit. Geneials one pair; vertical broader in front than its greatest length. 

 Postoculars two, temporals three ; loreal long and narrow. Color reddish 

 brown, a darker shade crossing each occipital obliquely and uniting behind 

 them into a dorsal hand, which is soon broken into spots. These are obsolete 

 on the middle and hinder part of the body. No lateral series of spots. Belly 

 immaculate. See Hallowell 1. c.

The stoutness of the body and tail, and the shortness of the latter, the in- 

 distinctness of the head, and the general firmness and rigidity, are characters 

 by which the greater number of the species of this sub-family may at once be 

 recognized. But as in some genera, certain of these peculiarities vanish, thus 

 approximating them to other groups, we have followed M. Dumeril in employ- 

 ing the dentition, which is here quite characteristic. Elsewhere, however, it 

 evidently fails to characterize natural groups, as urged by Dr. Giinther in his 

 invaluable catalogue of the Colubrine snakes in the British Museum. We 

 have, therefore, omitted the genera Rhinostoma, Phimophis* and Homalo- 

 cranion, which have the posterior superior maxillaries grooved, and are perhaps 

 more nearly allied to Scytale. A single specimen of Scytale coronatum, 

 of a variety near that called S. Neuwiedii in the Erpetologie Generale was 

 described by us, Proc. of this Acad., 1859, p. 294, as Olisthenes euphaeus. 

 Our conviction of its generic distinctness was grounded upon the peculiar form 

 of the rostral plate, which while offering strong characters among some ser- 

 pents, here varies with the individual. 



* Phimophis G u e r i n i , the only species. It is Rhinosimus G u e r i n i of Dumeril and

 more than fifty years previously.

This shell is remarkable by its weight in proportion to its size. It may be 

 compared to the Cyrena Bengalensis Lamarck, from which it differs, how- 

 ever, in being heavier, having less prominent beaks, and by being slightly 

 more inflated ; its epidermis is darker and more heavily sulcated. 



2. Cyrena Corbiculaeformis Prime. C. testa trigona, sub-inflata, in-

 dentibus cardinalibus tribus, inaequalibus ; lateralibus praelougis. 



Shell triangular, somewhat inflated, inequilateral, beaks prominent, pos- 

 terior margin angular, three cardinal teeth, the two posterior ones of nearly 

 the same size, anterior one less developed ; lateral teeth elongated, not promi-

Long. 1 3-10 ; lat. 1 2-10 ; diam. 7-10 poll. 



Hab. Cochin in Malabar. 



This species is different from any Cyrena known to me, but bears much re- 

 semblance in its general forrn to certain species of Corbicula.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 81 



abundantly, and at all seasons of the year, in the vicinity of Jalapa, Coatepec, 

 Orizaba, and many other places in Mexico ; but Mr. Gould, in his Monograph of 

 Humming Birds, states, that it is ako found in Guatemala, and seems disposed 

 to assign that country as its propeflocality. It is quite possible it nests there 

 also, but the fact that it remains in Mexico all the year round, and as I have often 

 found its nest in the months of April and May, I believe it is most properly to 

 be considered a bird of the country last mentioned. 



This pretty little bird is very familiar and unsuspicious, and allows a person 

 to approach it very near in the woods, and is a constant visitor to the gardens 

 in the towns and cities. Like the fine species mentioned in my first paper, it 

 frequents the Mazapan flowers, around which it may be seen at all hours of the 

 day. 



The nest of this species is lined on the inside with the tule silky floss, which is 

 the case with nearly all the Humming Birds in this part of Mexico. On the 

 outside it is covered with moss from the rocks, in such handsome and ingenious 

 manner that would be very difficult for man to imitate. T^ere are generally 

 two eggs, but on one occasion I found three in one nest. The eggs are white, 

 oblong, rather elongated, and large in proportion to the size of the bird. 



The upper part of the head in this species is of a most brilliant metallic azure 

 color, the upper parts of the body and wing coverts are brown, shaded with 

 bronze green; the tail and its coverts are of the same, but not so bright; the 

 wings are as long as the tail, and of an umber purplish color, the throat is 

 satin-like white, with the sides of a bluish green, or rather feathers of both 

 colors mixed together, very lustrous ; the under part of the body and the feathers 

 of the leg are dull white; the under surface of the wings is bronzed brownish 

 gray ; the under tail coverts are of the same, but less brilliant, and with the 

 edges of each feather lighter, the feet, nails and upper mandible are black, the 

 mandible is about one third black at its point, and flesh color at its base. 



Total length, i\ inches, wing 2, tail \\, bill f inches. The female is of the 

 same size as the male, and the only difference between the two sexes is that the 

 blue of the head and the white of the breast are of not so decided colors in the 

 female, although this difference only occurs at certain seasons of the year. 

 The cranium of the male can be distinguished also from that of the female, 

 being rather larger. 



The Committee to which was referred a communication from Mr. 

 P. B. Du Chaillu, asserting that the Academy is his debtor for a 

 part of the costs of a certain exploration in Africa made by him, 

 reported in substance that Mr. Du Chaillu has no claim whatever on 

 this institution. 



Dr. Carson said : 



Mr. President, I rise to perform the painful duty of announcing the death 

 of our associate, Dr. Edward Hallowell, which took place on the 21st instant, 

 from consumption ; and I feel that in connection with this announcement, it 

 is especially proper from me should come the remarks which will serve to do 

 honor to his memory as a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences. He 

 was not only an intimate friend, but one of long standing, having almost uni- 

 formly been educated together, at first in the Collegiate Department of the 

 University of Pennsylvania, then as students of Medicine in the office of the 

 late Dr. Hewson, and in the Medical Department of the University. 



In early life Dr. Hallowell was remarkable for his studious habits, and pro- 

 ficiency in the branches of his Collegiate Course. He always had a prominent 

 position, and graduated with the highest honors of his class. To the Science 

 of Medicine, which he subsequently pursued with ardor, and in which for 



I860.] 6 




82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



many years he labored zealously as a practitioner, he made important contri- 

 butions, in the department of pathology. His paper upon the subject of Cholera 

 Infantum is an admirable and original ^dition to the knowledge of that 

 disease, by which medical literature was enriched, and American medical 

 authorship advanced in estimation abroad. It is looked upon as authoritative, 

 with respect to the true pathology of the affection. 



As a member of the Academy he labored industriously, and from the time 

 of his election was devoted to the interests of the Institution. His depart- 

 ment was that of Herpetology, and I may appeal to the collection for proof of 

 his usefulness, and to the publications for evidences of his ability to place be- 

 fore the public the large amount of new information derived from the materials 

 at his command. When a few years ago he was stricken down by disease, his 

 loss as a working member of the Academy was severely felt and lamented. 



As an associate Dr. Hallowell was a favorite of his fellow members. His 

 manners were always urbane and deferential to the views and feelings of 

 others, his temperwas uniformly equable and not readily ruffled ; the kindness 

 of his heart was a perennial spring, while his sense of justice led him to 

 acknowledge the merits and the services of all who, like himself, were en- 

 gaged in scientific occupations. 



We have lost in him a worthy and beloved associate, and most sincerely 

 deplore his too early death, although to him it is a gain. 



The following resolutions were then offered by Dr. Le Conte and 

 adopted : 



Resolved, That the Academy has learned with sincere regret the death of its 

 late member, Dr. Edward Hallowell. 



Resolved, That in Dr. Hallowell the Academy has lost one of its most en- 

 thusiastic and laborious students and valued associates ; one who has endeared 

 himself to his fellow members, as well by his high personal qualities as by 

 his steadfast and successful pursuit of science. 



March Qth. 

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 

 Forty members present. 



Dr. Joseph Wilson (Surgeon U. S. Navy) related that he had in his pos- 

 session, during some months, on board of the U. S. ship Vandalia, a female 

 whelp of a small Ocelot, (Felis pardalis minimus,) commonly called "tiger- 

 cat." It was obtained in Realejo, Nicaragua, in the month of December, 1858. 

 At that time it was too young to eat anything except milk, but gradually came 

 to eat crumbs of bread from her cup, and small scraps of meat. The animal was 

 light gray, beautifully marked with dark elliptical rings and spots, light un- 

 derneath ; ears quite short, rounded, with a lunated white spot on top ; the 

 tail about the length of the body and nearly black. She was of the size of an 

 ordinary cat, and weighed five pounds eight ounces when ten months old. 

 She was transferred to the Doctor's protection in March 1859, when her age 

 was conjectured to be four months. She was named Miss Tiger by accla- 

 mation, and became reconciled to her change of abode much more readily 

 than I was prepared to expect. The Vandalia was miserably infested by rats, 

 and in the course of a few hours she received her first lesson in the valuable 

 accomplishment of catching them. A young rat was caught in a trap and pre- 

 sented to her attention ; she hesitated but a moment, when she commenced 

 struggling to get at it, and when permitted she pounced upon it with great 

 fierceness ; she walked about growling with her prize, evidently proud of the 

 conquest. She afterwards played with it for about three hours, performing 

 many fantastic tricks in the way of tossing it up and catching it as it came 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. S3 



down, turning somer-saults and rolling over with it in her paws. After this 

 she seemed quite at home, and required no more lessons in rat-catching, 

 though she eventually became very expert. It occasionally happened that a 

 rat was seen or heard in a store room or corner from which there was no 

 secret escape, and in all such cases Miss Tiger was immediately called upon 

 and carried to the scene of action. She generally pointed out by her actions 

 the locality of the object of pursuit, and stood ready to pounce upon it on the 

 very first opportunity. On these occasions she sometimes made tremendously 

 long bounds, say ten feet. Escapes in these cases were very rare. She 

 eventually came to understand this business so well, that when called she 

 would run out and exhibit an eagerness to be picked up and carried, com- 

 parable to that of a child who expects to be lifted into a carriage. In attack- 

 ing rats she was quite fearless, and so far as known was never hurt by them. 

 She mostly seized them by the back of the neck or head, but was not at all 

 particular if these parts did not happen to be the first in her reach. She soon 

 crushed the skull by forcing her long cuspid teeth through it, generally kill- 

 ing her prey so quickly that it was not even heard to squeal. After playing 

 with it a moderate time, she would eat it, commencing with the head and pro- 

 gressing steadily till she finished with the end of the tail, only stopping a 

 moment to lick her chops, when she came to the heart or other titbit. Imag- 

 ining that the hair and hide were not very good food for her, I once partially 

 skinned one that she might learn to tear off the skin and leave it ; but this 

 was labor lost, as she immediately began to eat the skin, hair and all, in pre- 

 ference to the other part. Rats were sometimes taken from her and thrown 

 overboard, as she occasionally caught more than she could manage to eat ; 

 but she soon began to show her disapprobation of this measure by a very 

 startling, fierce and threatening growl. The first occasion it waked me up at 

 about midnight, and when I went out to inquire what was wrong with Miss 

 Tiger, I found her sitting near a big rat and growling in a very unusual and 

 startling manner at about six men whom she had driven from their beds by 

 her threatening. They were standing around her with various weapons in 

 their hands, but there was very little prospect of moving her without some 

 severe bites and scratches. As I approached a little nearer than the rest she 

 showed a disposition to take her prize in her mouth, and while her teeth were 

 thus employed I caught her by the top of her shoulders and she permitted me, 

 without the least resistance, to carry her off, rat and all, to a place on deck, 

 where her growling could not annoy the sleepers. She was frequently carried 

 off in this manner afterwards both by myself and by others. She would sit 

 by the hour very quietly near her property, till she was disturbed by some 

 movement near her, when she would commence with her threatening growl, 

 which was loud enough and fierce enough to make the firmest stand back, 

 till they had seen and reflected on the state of affairs. She had another 

 gentle, plaintive growl, which she used in calling for her breakfast and in 

 showing dissatisfaction on ordinary slight occasions. She had no cry which 

 could be compared to the mewing of the cat, but she could purr to perfection 

 when in search of a warm bed. Her favorite food was rare beef steak, which 

 she even preferred to rats ; but hunger and petting eventually induced her to 

 eat bread and butter for her breakfast, whenever she had a night of unsuc- 

 cessful hunting. 



The gentleness of this pet was really astonishing. She allowed herself to 

 be picked up by any body, without any worse mark of dissatisfaction than a 

 little growling. Even when feeding, and under apprehension that her rat was 

 about to be taken from her, she would not bite or scratch. She would play 

 with a handkerchief much in the same manner as with a rat. She was fond 

 of being handled, and when rubbed with the hand she would roll about on 

 her back and pretend she was going to bite, seizing the fingers between her 

 teeth, growling and biting with such cautious gentleness as not to be in any

danger of wounding the skin. But one exception to this occurred ; one of 

 the officers attempted to play with her in this manner with kid gloves on, and 

 was immediately punished for his foppery by having her long teeth instantly 

 forced through both his glove and his finger. She may have perceived some 

 difference between the texture of the gloves and that of the fingers on which 

 she was accustomed to try her teeth. She knew very well where to find warm 

 sleeping places. She would for this purpose visit the hammocks of the men 

 at night, and waken any sleeper she happened to fancy by patting him gently 

 on the face with her paw. If encouraged and welcomed by a pat on the back 

 or top of the head, she would lie down either against his breast or at his feet ; 

 but if refused by one or two very gentle boxes on the ear, she would retire 

 with a discontented growl and seek a more hospitable sleeper. How she 

 learned to distinguish between the taps on the top of the head as marks of 

 approbation, and those on the sides of the opposite signification, is a subject of 

 mystery, but there is no doubt of the fact ; perhaps some of the men may 

 have taught her the difference by boxing her more energetically. 



She was very fond of licking the men about the face and gently pinching their 

 ears in her teeth ; and although she frequently engaged in this disagreeable 

 amusement, she never wounded any one in the least while thus occupied. In 

 cold weather she was very fond of getting between blankets, and required but 

 the very slighest encouragement to crawl into the very middle of a bed and 

 roll herself up in this position for her morning nap. 



On one occasion it was noticed that she had a large tumor on the side of 

 her face, and a large abscess formed. It was at first supposed that she had 

 hurt her face in playing with a catfish ; some one, however, noticed that it 

 proceeded from an irregularity in shedding one of the milk teeth. One of 

 the officers, of uncommon zeal in such matters, proposed to hold her while 

 the obnoxious tooth was extracted. I determined to gratify him in this 

 matter, and to the astonishment of all he held Miss Tiger on his lap while I 

 extracted the obnoxious tooth with a pair of forceps, and neither of us was 

 scratched during the operation. 



She was fond of dark places, and delighted in running about deck and up the 

 rigging early in the mornings and on cloudy days. When the men were 

 called aloft to furl "top gallant sails," she would jump to the shrouds and 

 have a race with them up the rigging, and with very little effort she was ' ' first 

 man in the top. ' ' 



She generally showed so much excitement in the presence of birds, that 

 doubtless her instinct would lead her to seize them. She killed three or four 

 chickens at different times secretly, and off Cape Horn she seized and killed 

 an albatross of at least double her weight. A common green parrot was 

 at one time on board and she was exceedingly eager to get at it, but she 

 was boxed a little on the ears and her head turned the other way a few times, 

 till she appeared to understand that it was not for her. Subsequently, when 

 she appeared to be watching it too intently, she was boxed a little and driven, 

 till in about a week she seemed to regard it as one of the family. 



In the beginning of December we were passing the "West India Islands, the 

 ship, in her course, starting flocks of flying fish, in which Miss Tiger became 

 interested, they looked so much like birds. She was observed in the moon- 

 light watching them very intently. Her absence was noticed at breakfast. 

 A search through the ship made it certain she had been lost overboard 

 during the night.

And were referred to a Committee. 



Mr. Lea stated that when he made some remarks, a few weeks since, on the 

 Unionida of the United States, he gave th9 number of thetn incorrectly by an 

 inadvertence. He now desired to restate them numerically : 



Unio, 465 species.

 It will be observed that we have not in North America either of the genera 

 Triquetra, (Hyria, Lam.,) Prisodon, (Castalia, Lam.,) Monocondylcea, Mycetopus, 

 yssa?idonta, or Plagiodon. They are all emphatically South American types, 

 while there does not seem to inhabit the southern half of America a single 

 species of Margaritana, (Alasmodonta, Say.) Ferussac has described a species 

 (A. incurva) as coming from South America, but there is reasonable doubt of 

 it. The Monocondylcea and Margaritana seem mutually to replace each other. 

 The Uniones and Anodontce prevail in both parts of the continent over all the 

 other genera, both as to numbers and universality of distribution. The genus 

 Mulleria, (Acostea, D'Orb.) has only been found in the tributaries of the Mag- 

 dalena in New Granada. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a specimen of the singular 

 body, named Hyalonema mirabilis, recently presented by Dr. Ruschenberger. 

 It is the second specimen obtained within a short time for the Academy. Both 

 are from Japan. The specimen of Hyalonema exhibited, consists of a twisted 

 cord of siliceous spiculse over a foot in length, and about half an inch in 

 diameter. Twisted around it is a coriaceous membrane with wart-like eminen- 

 ces, belonging to a zoophyte, which Dr. L. regards with M. Valenciennes as 

 parasitic. The cord of siliceous spiculse, Dr. J. E. Gray supposes to be the 

 axis of the zoophyte, but Dr. L. with M. Valenciennes, views it as belonging 

 to a sponge. This latter view is apparently confirmed by a specimen of a 

 sponge, in the cabinet of the Academy, from Santa Cruz, presented by the late 

 Dr. Griffith. This sponge is an oblong oval mass, about four inches long, sur- 

 mounted at one extremity with a corona of twisted cords of siliceous spiculse 

 about two inches in length. These spiculse are very similar in structure to 

 those of the Hyalonema, mainly differing in size.

" Description of four new species of Melanidae of the United States,

And were referred to Committees. 



Dr. Leidy announced the presentation by Dr. T. B. Wilson of his 

 entire collection of birds, amounting to 26,000 mounted specimens, 

 and 2,000 skins. 



Mr. Cassin said, in relation to the presentation of the collection of 

 birds now in the Museum of this Academy, by Dr. T. B. Wilson : 



The collection of birds in the Museum of the Academy has been 

 regarded for some years as the collection of this Academy, and is ex- 

 tensively known and referred to as such by authors and naturalists. 

 The donation this evening, so liberally and characteristically made by 

 Dr. Wilson, involves only a change of ownership, or transfer of title, 

 with the further important consideration that it secures the collection 

 to the Academy, as intended by Dr. Wilson, in perpetuity and without 

 contingency. 



Previous to this donation the collection has been the private property 

 of Dr. Wilson, and has been accumulated from various sources, since 

 1845, with great judgment, and with constant and unremitted exertion 

 on his part and also on the part of his brother, Mr. Edward Wilson, 

 long resident in Europe. The latter named gentleman has most ably 

 and successfully seconded his brother in the greatest enterprises ever 

 entered upon in America, having for their object the promotion of the 

 Zoological Sciences and of general Natural History. The results mainly 

 have been, at this period, the formation of the Library of this Academy 

 and of its collections in all departments, but especially in Mineralogy, 

 Palaeontology, Conchology, Crustacea, Icthyology and Ornithology. 



The very extensive and comprehensive series now presented, with 

 the comparatively small collection previously owned by the Academy, 

 comprise one of the most complete Ornithological Museums extant. It 

 is, in fact, one of the four great collections of birds in the world, and, 

 so far as can be ascertained from published catalogues, is fairly entitled 

 to be considered as presenting facilities for study in this favorite 

 branch of Natural History equal to those of any other Institution. 



Mainly, the collection of Dr. Wilson was based on that of General 

 Massena, Duke of Rivoli, and his son, M. Victor Massena, Prince 

 D'Essling, which was regarded as the finest private collection in 

 Europe. This was acquired by purchase in 1846, and brought to this 

 country. Various other valuable and more or less extensive collections 



[Marchj 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



have been added since that period, including Mr. Gould's Australian 

 birds, which are the types of his great work, " The Birds of Austra- 

 lia/' and embracing all the species then known, except five only. 

 Another important collection, mainly Parrots, Humming Birds and 

 Tanagers, was that of M. Bourcier, a distinguished French Ornitholo- 

 gist, and quite equally so was a collection made in the interior coun- 

 tries of India by Capt. Boys, of the East India Company's service. 

 Very important, too, are collections from the Ley den Museum, through 

 the influence of the eminent naturalists now or lately attached to that 

 great Institution, particularly the celebrated Temminck, and many 

 others obtained in Europe through the faithful and judicious exertions 

 of Mr. Edward Wilson for the interests of this Academy. 



Numerous other smaller additions have been made, whenever oppor- 

 tunity presented, in this country, by Br. Wilson, and also have been 

 derived from European Naturalists by exchange and purchase to the 

 extent of several thousand specimens. Messrs. Verreaux, the well-known 

 commercial Naturalists and Ornithologists of Paris, have been of ex- 

 ceeding service, and but little less so has been Mr. John Gr. Bell, of 

 New York, the principal commercial Naturalist in this country, whose 

 high interest in the prosperity of the Academy and scientific know- 

 ledge has never failed to be exerted and always has been of great value 

 in the extension of the collection. Mr. John Krider, Mr. William S. 

 Wood and Mr. James Taylor, of this city, have also furnished to Br. 

 Wilson many valuable specimens, and all of these gentlemen have in- 

 variably shown the utmost cheerfulness and liberality in their business 

 with the Museum of the Academy. 



The collection now presented by Br. Wilson has been derived from 

 the following sources, and includes specimens nearly as here enumer- 

 ated : 



Bivoli collection, 1st purchase, - - 12,500 specimens, 



do. do. 2d do. - - - 2,500 < 



Mr. Gould's Australian collection, - - 2,000 u 



M. Bourcier's collection, .... 1,000 " 



Capt. Boys' collection, .... 1,000 " 



Mr. Edward Wilson's collections in Europe, 

 including collections from the Leyden and Bri- 

 tish Museums, 4,500 " 



Br. Thos. B. Wilson's collections in Europe, 1,000 " 



do. do. do. in the U. S., . 1,500 " 



Total now presented to the Academy, 26,000 " 



It may be of interest to add that the collection previously owned by 

 the Academy comprises about 3000 specimens, including a very supe- 

 rior North American series derived from nearly all ornitluologists in 

 the United States, who have invariably shown the greatest interest in 

 the formation of the large collection of this Academy. The aggregate 

 number of specimens exhibited and now belonging to the Academy is 

 therefore about twenty-nine thousand birds.

83 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Mr. Lea read extracts from letters of Dr. Lewis, of Mohawk, New York, on 

 the subject of the coloring matter of the nacre of the genus Unio, and exhibited 

 some fine specimens to illustrate the subject. The following extracts will fully 

 convey Dr. Lewis's ideas on this subject which has much interest with the 

 naturalist. 



" I hinted something about Uniones being colored with an oxide or salt of 

 gold. My reasons for this are derived from observing some singular phenomena 

 in colors on submitting shells to the action of chloride of gold, and then bring- 

 ing them in contact with tin. Whether a stannate of gold formed and precipi- 

 tated on the shells or not, I cannot say, but the colors were very much intensi- 

 fied. It is to be remarked that the colors of such shells as Unio complanatus 

 and of U. ligamentinus, when colored, are such as result from the presence of gold 

 in a state of atomic division and dissemination in a semi-opake body. I think 

 nitro-muriatic acid with a minute trace of gold in it, if applied to shells, will 

 produce colors, but I never have satisfactorily demonstrated this. My observa- 

 tions are derived from having once used acid in which was a small quantity of 

 gold, too small to be reclaimed." 



" I notice that colors are most brilliant in regions where gold may be sus- 

 pected. In the Lake regions of the Western States, minerals are abundant, 

 and the conditions are not incompatible with the supposition that gold is spar- 

 ingly disseminated among them, in quantities too small perhaps to be available, 

 but no doubt it is there." 



"As regards colors in the nacre of Uniones, j on are correct in saying that 

 Uniones are colored where there is no gold. Hut there are some species that are 

 not colored unless you find them in some particular localities. If that is taken 

 iuto consideration we shall, perhaps, be more ready to accept the gold theory. 

 Modern investigations show that gold exists in soils that, until they were rigidly 

 tested, were not suspected to contain it. In fact I am disposed to believe that 

 gold is more universally disseminated than is generally supposed." 



" But, the question is one I take no particular interest in, except that, it pre- 

 sents itself incidentally. I know one fact that you 'also know. That of two 

 streams producing identically the same species, one will give a large propor- 

 tion of white nacres, and the other will present colored nacres, and usually we 

 also notice another phenomenon a greater brilliancy of nacre where rich colors 

 abound. In this case I have my private opinion that gold produces its peculiar 

 tonic effect, for tonic it is under certain circumstances by increasing the secre- 

 tions." 



" To have gold in a shell, it is not necessary it should be an oxide. It is only 

 necessary it should have been received into the circulation of the animal, in 

 solution as chloride, or some other possible soluble form that chemistry has not 

 brought to light; and when once in the circulation it may be eliminated by be- 

 ing deprived of its solving principle and excreted or secreted with the other 

 solid matter that enters into the formation of the shell. The stannate of gold, or 

 purple of Cassius, may be wholly deprived of the tin associated with it, yet re- 

 tain its purple color, and its condition of atomic division, if so you are pleased 

 to call it. But I only offer this as suggestive of something for those interested 

 to follow further. I am not enough of a chemist to develop any facts out of a 

 suspicion of this kind." 



Mr. Lea remarked, after reading the above extracts, that the purple, pink and 

 salmon color of many of our American Unionidce had had his attention from the 

 period of his first studying this beautiful and interesting family, more than thirty 

 years since. Without having experimented himself upon them, he was aware 

 that no chemist had been able to detect the presence of a metal or other 

 elementary body. . He therefore thought it likely to be caused by the presence 

 of some organic body which had not yet been detected; such is supposed by 

 chemists to be the case with the colored fluates of lime, colored quartz, &c. 

 What Dr. Lewis states as regards the colors being more frequent and more in- 

 tense in the waters of Michigan and irithe streams leading into the northern 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 89 



great lakes from the southern side, is very true. The Unio rectus is usually 

 white in the Ohio, though sometimes tinted with purple and salmon color, while 

 in the more northern waters it is usually of a fine rich purple or salmon. Two 

 specimens from the upper Mississippi, brought by Dr. Cooper, were exhibited 

 by Mr. Lea, which were of exquisite purple and salmon. The Unio ligamentinus 

 has probably never been found pink or purple in the Ohio, while at Grand 

 Rapids, Michigan, those with a fine pink and salmon color are very common. 

 The Margaritana margaritifera of Columbia river and its tributaries has a fine 

 purple nacre in almost all the specimens, rarely white, while those in the rivers 

 of Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts are almost universally white, 

 as those from the northern part of Europe are also. 



Dr. Draper had informed Mr. Lea that he had calcined some of these purple 

 shells, but that they had burned white and he had not detected any metallic sub- 

 tance in their composition. The subject was certainly one well worth the pursuit, 

 as no doubt could remain that the color was derived from some foreign sub- 

 stance entering into the composition of some individuals, while others were 

 free from it. It was not an uncommon case to find the dorsal portion of 

 the nacre to be pink or* purple while the other portions were white, and this was 

 also sometimes the case with the cavity of the beaks. Mr. Lea did not believe 

 the color arose, as some persons supposed, from the structure of the surface of 

 the nacre dividing the rays of light by thin laminations. This division of 

 color was exhibited in almost every species, and is what naturalists call the 

 " pearly hue," oftentimes of great beauty, but quite a different matter from 

 the pink, purple and salmon color of the mass of the carbonate of lime com- 

 posing the substance of the valves.

Descriptions of Fifteen new Species of Uruguayan TJNIONIDiE. 



BY ISAAC LEA. 



During the winter of 1858-59, R. B.Forbes, Esq., of Boston, whose name has 

 been identified with so many works of philanthropy and public utility, organ- 

 ized an excursion to the La Plata, the Uruguay and Rio Negro rivers, in South 

 America; his object in part being to afford facilities for studying the natural his- 

 tory of the countries bordering on these waters. Professor J. Wyman, who ac- 

 companied him, has most kindly placed at my disposal all the specimens of the 

 Unionidoz which he had been enabled to collect in these extensive southern fresh 

 waters. In this very interesting collection I was surprised to find so many 

 species which had not been before observed. These are now herein described, 

 and consist of eleven Uniones and four Anodonta. The whole number brought 

 of these fresh water Mulluscs, was twenty-three species. Those heretofore de- 

 scribed are Prisodon truncatus, Schum., (Caslalia ambigua, Lam.,) Unio Para- 

 nensis, Lea., U. parallelopipedon, Lea., Anodonta rotunda, Spix, A. trapezalis, Lam., 

 A. laio-marginata, Lea, A. tenebricosa, Lea, A. Blainvilliana, Lea. In addition 

 there were three small species of Cyrena, two of which I have not ascertained, 

 the third is the variegata of D'Orbigny. There was also a small species of 

 Cyclas.

Dear Sir, The undersigned, children of the late Augustus E. Jessup, be- 

 lieving that it was his intention to leave a sum of money to the " Academy 

 of Natural Sciences," for the purposes stated below, and desiring to carry out 

 what we have cause to think were his intentions, propose to pay to the Acad- 

 emy the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars per annum, to be applied to 

 its Publication Fund, and the further sum of four hundred and eighty dollars 

 per annum, to be used for the support of one or more deserving poor young 

 man or men, who may desire to devote the whole of his or their time and 

 energies to the study of any of the Natural Sciences. 



The above sums we propose to pay as long as we feel our circumstances to 

 be such as will warrant our doing so, and we look forward to investing in 

 trust, at some not distant time, the principal of the sums named, for the pur- 

 pose of creating a perpetual fund for the above named uses. 



Signed, A. E. Jessup.

A paper was presented for publication, entitled, " Conspectus Piscium

 J. Rodgers ducibus, a Guilelmo Stirnpson, M. D., collectore ; Sicydianae: 

 auctore Theo. Grill." 



Mr. Lesley read the following extract from a letter received from 

 Mr. T. S. Hunt, Chemist of the Canada Geological Survey, dated 

 Montreal, March 25th, 1860 : 



"If we mingle in equivalent proportions the chlorides of calcium and 

 magnesium in concentrated solution, and then having precipitated the bases 

 by a slight excess of carbonate of soda in the cold, and expose the mixture for a 

 few hours in a closed flask to a temperature of 200 212 F., the pasty mass 

 is entirely transformed into a beautiful granular powder, made up of spherical, 

 translucent, crystalline grains, which are sparingly soluble in cold, dilute, acetic 

 acid and are a double carbonate of lime and magnesia. In my previous and 

 published trials, at temperatures of 300 400 c F., the product was much less 

 beautiful, and was mingled with carbonate of magnesia. It now remains to 

 be seen whether the combination may not be slowly effected at a temperature 

 much below 200 F., and experiments upon this point are in progress." 



Mr. Lesley drew the attention of the Academy to the significant direction 

 in which these and similar experiments are carrying the chemical geology of 

 the day. If they result in nothing more than the destruction of those igneous 

 prejudices which still shackle observers, especially in metamorphic mineral re- 

 gions, and set us free to study ab initio the phenomena of magnetic iron veins, 

 copper lodes and gold quartz, primary limestones, serp^ptmes and dolomites, 

 the consequences must be practically important. 



Mr. Foulke remarked the equally important bearing the low temperature 

 of these experiments must be seen to have, on the theory of non-fossiliferous, 

 primary rocks. If metamorphism has been possible at such low temperatures, 

 the argument in favor of the destruction of organic remains from metamorphic 

 strata by fiery agencies is of force no longer, and we must conclude that these 

 early and apparently non-fossiliferous rocks were really destitute of life. 



Dr. Leidy stated that he had just received a short notice from Prof. 

 Leuckart, of Giessen, in which he mentions the results of some experiments 

 with Trichina spiralis. Having fed dogs with human flesh containing 

 Trichinae, he found that in a week or less, the worms completed their devel- 

 opment, but without assuming the form of a Tricocephalus or Strongylus. 

 Within the intestine of the dog, the generative apparatus, together with the 

 eggs and embryos, were fully developed in the Trichina?. The embryos 

 rapidly pass away with the excrement of the dog. A pig having been fed with 

 a dog's intestine containing fully developed Trichinae, was killed and dissected 

 on the 3d of March, and exhibited in the muscles millions of Trichinae. From 

 these facts it is rendered probable that embryos of Trichina voided by dogs 

 find their way into the human stomach through the food or drink, and sub- 

 sequently burrow into the tissues of the body.

Mr. Lea remarked that he had recently received from Prof. J. Wyman 

 specimens in alcohol of two s*pecies of Anodonta from the Uruguay River, 

 South America, descriptions of the soft parts of which he had made, and in- 

 tended, at a future time, to publish in the Journal at length ; but he wished 

 at present to mention that he had found a form of Palpi (mouth lips) different 

 from any of the (Jnionidce which had come under his notice from any other 

 part of the world. The form of the Palpi heretofore described have always 

 been obliquely or transversely elliptical or subtriangular, while these two spe- 

 cies, An._Wym.anii, Lea, and.4n. lato-marginata, hen,, are round, and the pair on 

 either side only joined above, the edges being entirely free. It is greatly to 

 be regretted that more or all the South American Unionidce could not have 

 been examined, as regards their soft parts, to ascertain if this difference of 

 form of the Palpi should be persistently different in all the South American 

 Unionida;, or only with this member of the family the Anodontai.

And were referred to Committees. 



Mr. Lesley described a boulder of gneiss, eight feet high, on the summit of 

 one of the Orange Co. highlands, in the State of New York, which was sup- 

 ported by four smaller rocks, so that it was lifted about a foot above the floor 

 of nearly horizontal gneiss, forming the top of the mountain. One of these 

 supports was a hard blue limestone, from the crust of which Mr. Lesley ob- 

 tained numerous fossils, among which was probably the Orthis costalis, (Hall,) 

 of the Chazy Limestone. Another block of limestone, also fossiliferous, lay 

 not far away, and a few small pieces of a reddish sandstone like that of certain 

 bands in the Oneida Conglomerate ; but with these exceptions, there was neither 

 drift nor diluvial striae visible, but here and there large blocks of gneiss. 

 The whole surface of the exposures, which were numerous and many hundred 

 feet square, has been weathered down 2 or 3 inches, as is evident from the 

 ridges of refractory quartz veins, which have successfully resisted the atmo- 

 sphere. On this weathered surface occur what have been called the footmarks 

 of animals ; but these are nothing else than weathered-out nodules of rock 

 more ferruginous than the rest. The locality is two miles east of Southfield 

 Station, on the New York and Erie Railroad. Mr. Lesley and his brother were 

 accompanied and guided to the locality by Mr. T. B. Brooks and Mr. Jenkins, 

 two excellent local geologists and mineralogists, living in the village of Munroe.

98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Dr. Leidy stated that on last Saturday, in company with Dr. Darrach, he had 

 visited, to them, anewandrich botanical locality, which was worthy of the atten- 

 tion of those members interested in our local flora. This was at Jackson, N. J. 

 about 20 miles from Philadelphia, on the Camden and Atlantic Railway. A 

 cedar swamp, crossed by the latter, not one hundred yards from the station, 

 contains the greatest profusion of Saracenia purpurea, and Helonias bullata, 

 which is now in flower. Near by, they also found abundantly the Pyxidan- 

 thera and Cassandra both in flower. Oxycoccus, Drosera, etc., were also 

 noticed. The neighboring extensive forest tract is thickly carpeted with Gaul- 

 theria procumbens. 



Prof. W. B. Rogers communicated the result of observations which he had 

 made within the last year on the structural and geological relations of the Al- 

 bertite or so-called Albert Coal of New Brunswick. 



An examination of the mine afforded, as he thought, convincing proof that 

 this remarkable accumulation of asphaltic matetial could not have formed a 

 part of the regular carbonaceous deposits of the region, that it is not and 

 never has been a true bed or stratum, but that it should rather be regarded as a 

 mass collected within an irregular fissure of subsequent formation, by the dis- 

 tillation or infiltration of asphaltic matter from the surrounding bituminous 

 shales. 



The principal features of the deposit pointing to such an origin are the very 

 limited extent of the mass longitudinally traced, its sudden and great irregular- 

 ities of thickness and trend, and the yet more striking fact of its transverse direc- 

 tion in many parts of its course as compared with the bedding of the adjacent 

 rocks. In the lower level at a depth of about four hundred and sixty feet where 

 the combustible material has been removed almost entirely from end to end, the 

 slaty rocks are seen in many places abutting against the sides of the mine at 

 a steep angle, presenting frequently a jagged surface, such as would result from 

 a transverse fracture and gaping of the strata. The Albertite was seen adhering 

 to these irregular surfaces, as well in the cavities as on the projections, affording 

 even in hand specimens excellent examples of the discordance of the mass as to 

 position with the stratification of the contiguous rocks. 



It is worthy of note that the material thus adhering to the walls of the mine 

 has none of that intermixture with earthy sediment which so often marks the 

 contact of regular coal seams with the enclosing strata, but maintains the same 

 remarkable ( purity as in the midst of the mass. It is, moreover, quite free from 

 the carbonaceous and rocky debris, and other marks of mechanical violence, 

 which it must have presented had it originated in the dislocation and displace- 

 ment of a coal seam originally conformable with the stratification of the neigh- 

 borhood. 



These evidences of the nature and origin of the deposit are confirmed bjthe 

 statement that in the progress of the mining, several large fragments of the verti- 

 cal wall-rock have been found detached and imbedded in the midst of the Alber- 

 tite, and on one occasion a mass of unusually great dimensions could be traced 

 by correspondence of form to a cavity in the wall at some distance above, from 

 which it would seem to have fallen, while the contents of the fissure were still 

 but imperfectly solidified. 



The conclusions of Prof. Rogers, as to the origin and nature of this remark- 

 able deposit are thus completely in harmony with those which Prof. Leidy ha? 

 maintained on the ground of a microscopic examination of the material. 



Prof.W. B. Rogers gave an account of some experiments in binocular vision, 

 which he had devised for the purpose of testing the theory of the successive 

 combination of corresponding points as maintained by Sir David Brewster. 



In one class of these experiments two slightly inclined luminous lines were 

 combined into a perspective resultant, either with or without a stereoscope. On 

 looking at this intently for a few seconds, so as to induce the reverse ocular 



[April. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 99 



spectrum, and then directing the eyes towards a distant wall, a single spec- 

 trum was observed, having the attitude and relief of the original binocular 

 resultant. When the luminous lines were regarded in succession, each by the 

 corresponding eye, the other eye being shaded, so that no direct binocular 

 combination could be formed, it was found on looking towards the wall that 

 the subjective images united into a single spectral line, having the same relief 

 as if the lines had been directly combined in the stereoscope. 



In these experiments, according to the theory of Brewster, the resultant 

 spectrum, instead of being a single line in a perspective attitude ought to pre- 

 sent the form of two lines inclined or crossing, situated in the plane of the 

 wall without projection or relief. The conditions of the experiments are such 

 as exclude all opportunity of a shifting of the image on the retina, and this is 

 essential to the successive combinations of pairs of points required by the theory 

 in the production of perspective effect. 



A similar result was still more clearly shown by vibrating a screen between 

 the eyes and the twin pictures of a stereoscope, so as alternately to expose 

 and cover each, completely excluding the simultaneous vision of the two. 

 The stereoscopic relief was as apparent in these conditions as when the vibra- 

 ting screen was withdrawn. 



The perception of the resultant in its proper relief does not therefore require 

 that each pair of corresponding points should be combined by directing the 

 optic axes to them pair by pair in succession, as maintained by Brewster. 

 Nor is it necessary for the singleness of the resultant perception that the 

 images of corresponding points of the objects should fall on what are called 

 corresponding points of the retinse. The condition of single vision in such 

 cases seems to be simply this, that the pictures in the two eyes shall be such 

 and so placed as to be identical with the pictures which the real object would 

 form, if placed at a given distance and in a given attitude before the eyes. 



Dr. Ruschenberger asked how it is, under the explanation given by Prof. 

 Rogers, that a man with only one eye is capable of perceiving solidity, and of 

 appreciating the properties of photographs viewed stereoscopically. 



Mr. Powel asked at what rate per second the vibrating or revolving screen 

 presented its openings ; for if it happened eight or ten times in a second, 

 might it not fail to practically intercept vision ? Objects thus seen would ap- 

 pear permanently. Thus, although not appearing to each eye at the identical 

 instant of time, the object would be persistent in both, for an impression upon 

 the eye cannot be discharged oftener than about eight times in a second, some 

 impressions remain much longer. An object illuminated by a flash of light- 

 ning for a very instant, may thus appear solid to both eyes, the intense re- 

 flection impressed upon the retina endures long enough for the sensorium to 

 scan it in detail. A man takes quick aim with a rifle, it may be almost in- 

 stantaneously, yet by distinct operations and different foci of vision he must 

 see the distant mark the tip sight, and again the heel sight, no two of which 

 can be in focus at once. We have here successive points in a line, rapidly 

 scanned in determining position. The breadth of field of distinct vision is 

 exceedingly narrow for the same instant of time, and so is the penetration of 

 focus very short. A separate direction and a new adjustment of the eye must 

 be given for parts of even a very small object. 



Mr. P. remarked, while upon the subject, that he believed the stereoscopic 

 effect often noticed in viewing large photographic pictures with only one eye, 

 was caused by the aperture of the lens used in taking the picture ; for the 

 aperture is often so great that objects have an appreciable parallax from the 

 opposite margins of the aperture, and the picture thus contains more than 

 could be seen from one point. When both eyes, however, view such a picture 

 they decide that it is flat and in one plane, and their evidence denies the 

 stereoscopic effect which one eye cannot so well dispute.

Honograph of the Genus LABROSOMUS Sw. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



In the genus Clinus as proposed by Cuvier, and even as revised by Valen- 

 ciennes, there are dissimilar types which yet remain to be named and elevated 

 to the rank of genera. Among the species of this group, described by the latter 

 naturalist in the eleventh volume of the " Histoire Naturelle des Poissons," 

 there are several species which are distinguished by the presence of superciliary 

 tentacles, and of a transverse pectiniform series of filaments on the nape. 

 Those fishes provided with such appendages, have at the same time a much 

 less inequality between the spinous and soft portions of the dorsal than the 

 typical Clini, and the teeth in the outer row are much stronger. They would 

 therefore be correctly referred to a genus which is quite distinct from Clinus. 

 For this genus, the name Labrosomus, first proposed by Swainson, must be 

 adopted, but the characters given by that author to it are not the proper 

 generic ones, and the greater number of the species referred to it are not con- 

 generic with its type. 



The name of Labrosomus (or Labrisomus) was first published in 1839, in the 

 second volume of the "Natural History of Fishes, Amphibians and Reptiles." 

 At the seventy-fifth page of that volume, Swainson has divided the Cuvieran 

 genus Clinus into five genera : Clinus, of which the Clinus acuminatus 

 Cia\, is taken as the type; Labrisomus with Clinus pectinifer Val., as 

 type ; Tripterygion Risso, Cliniirachus Reese, which is typified by Blennius 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



variabilis of Rajinesque, and Blennophis,* of which the Clinus a n g u i l- 

 laris Val., is the only true species. Of these genera, Clinus Sw., and Cli- 

 nitrachusSw., are distinguished by false or illusive characters, and cannot be 

 regarded as distinct. The others are valid, but their characters require re- 

 vision. 



The only claim to distinction of the genus Labrosomus given by Swaiuson, 

 are founded on the strong, conic and pointed row of front teeth, behind which 

 are villiform ones ; a thicker body than in Clinus, and the "dorsal fin dis- 

 tinctly emarginate towards the caudal." The genus resting on these charac- 

 ters alone is composed of very incongruous elements. To it are referred, at 

 page 277 of the second volume, the following species, all of which are de- 

 scribed as species of Clinus by Valenciennes : Labrosomus g o b i o, L. p e c t i- 

 nifer, L. capillatus, L. Delalandii, L. linearis, L. variolosus, 

 L. Peruvianus, L. microcirrhis, L. ?geniguttatus, L. elegans, 

 L. ? littoreus and L. latipin n is. 



Of these species, not more than three can, with propriety, be regarded as 

 congeners-, if the Labrosomus pectinifer is taken as the type. These are 

 Labrosomus pectinifer, L. capillatus and perhaps L. Delalandii. 

 The latter is more probably the representative of a distinct genus. 



That genus is distinguished from Labrosomus by the smaller mouth, the pre- 

 sence of only two rays to the ventral fins, and perhaps by the undulating 

 margin of the spinous portion of the dorsal fin. It may be named Malacocte- 

 nus, in illusion to the pectiniform row of filaments. This genus is the nearest 

 ally of Labrosomus. All the others are very distinct. 



Labrisomus gobio Sw., is the type of quite a distinct genus, whose charac- 

 ters consist of a broad, depressed head, with a very short muzzle, large- ap- 

 proximated eyes, superciliary and nasal tentacles, two ventral rays and a com- 

 paratively short spinous dorsal. The genus may be called Gobioclinus. The 

 only species G-obioclinus gobio is found in the West Indies, and has but 

 eighteen dorsal spines. 



Labrisomus linea ri s Sw., is synonymous with Clinus brachycepha- 

 lus Val. This also is the type of a distinct genus distinguished by its abbre- 

 viated and blenniform head, the profile being very convex ; by the villiform 

 teeth, the absence of superciliary tentacles, the spinous portion of the dorsal 

 long, and the presence of only two rays to the ventral fins. The name of 

 Blennioclinus is conferred on it ; for the species, the specific name of Valenci- 

 ennes must be retained. 



Labrisomus variolosus is distinguished by a large thick head, with 

 lateral eyes, short superciliary tentacles and a small nuchal one. The mouth 

 is large ; the teeth of the jaws in an outer row strong and conical, behind 

 which are villiform ones ; those of the vomer and palate villiform and in three 

 patches, one on the vomer and one on each palatine bone. The spinous por- 

 tion of the dorsal is long, and the ventrals have each three rays. The species 

 thus characterized is the type of a new genus which may be named Anchenion- 

 chus. 



Labrisomus microcirrhis, L. elegans and L. Peruvianus are 

 nearly related to Anchenionchus, and are from the same zoological province. 



Labrosomus ? geniguttatusis distinguished from Anchenio ichus by the 

 more approximated eyes, and by the disposition of the vomero-palatine teeth, 

 as well as the small size of the anterior row of maxillary teeth. The dorsal 

 is moderately long, and each of the ventrals have three rays. The mouth is 

 comparatively small, and there are superciliary, nasal and nuchal tentacles. 

 For this species, the generic name of Callicllnus is proposed. 



* Valenciennes has since given the name of Blennophis to a very distinct genus from 

 that to which Swainson appplied the names. As Swainson's genua is a natural one, 

 another name must be substituted for that of Valenciennes Ophioblennius is therefore 

 propused.

104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Labrisomus ? littoreus may possibly belong to the genus Acanthoclinus of 

 Jenyns, but it is only known from a drawing and description. 



Labrisomus latipinnis is related to Blennioclinus, but is distinguished 

 from tbe species of that genus by the presence of superciliary tentacles. The 

 generic name of Ophthalmolophus may be retained for it. 



If the above views of the limits of the Labrosomus are correct, only two of 

 the species assigned by Swainson to the genus truly belong to it. Of the re- 

 maining species, nearly each one belongs to a genus distinct from the others. 

 The affinities and characters of the genera above indicated will be more fully 

 exposed at another time. 



About three years after the publication of the work of Swainson, the same 

 species that served as the type of the genus of that naturalist, was described 

 by Dr. Dekay, in the ichthyological part of his "Zoology of New York, or the 

 New York Fauna," as the representative of a new genus of Percoids, under 

 the name of Lepisoma. That the genus Lepisoma is identical with the Labri- 

 somus of Swainson, no one can entertain a doubt after a perusal of the generic 

 and specific description of Dekay. 



Dr. Dekay has given the characters of his genus Lepisoma, as follows : 



" Body and fins scaly. Fleshy filaments along the basal line of the head and 

 on the orbits. A single dorsal fin. Branchial rays six. Teeth in the jaws 

 vomer and palatines. Ventrals before the pectorals." 



Dekay in his remarks, states "that it is with much hesitation that he places 

 this genus at the end of the jugular section of this family (Percidse). In its 

 general aspect, it might readily be referred to the families Scisenidse or Labri- 

 dae ; but the presence-of vomerine and palatine teeth excludes it from them." 



The amiable naturalist was much mistaken in regard to the affinities of the 

 genus, as must be perceptible from his descriptions. Even in his brief generic 

 diagnosis, the ichthyologist is surprised by the peculiarity described by the 

 second sentence ; ' ' fleshy filaments along the base of the head and on the orbits.'''' 

 This character is so peculiar, so much at variance with the compact character, 

 if I may so express myself, of the head in the family of Percoids, that it might 

 well cause the naturalist to doubt if a fish with such appendages can really be- 

 long to the family of Percoids. On a careful examination of the specific de- 

 scription, the characters are found to disagreee more and more with the natural 

 ones of the family to which Dekay has referred it. 



The scales are described as being " moderate, rounded, finely striate on their 

 free surfaces, with a smooth membranous margin.'" The head is "corrugated 

 and destitute of scales. Along the basal line of the head, on each side, are nine 

 or ten fleshy processes, ending in bifid or trifid filaments," &c. "Another fleshy 

 process arises from beneath the upper margin of the orbit, which subdivides into 

 .six or eight smaller processes," &c. The anterior nostril has a "fleshy valve, 

 through which is pierced the nasal aperture ; its posterior border elongated and 

 terminating in six or eight filaments.'" The opercle and preopercle are rounded 

 and smooth on their margins." 



All of the attributes of the species underlined in the foregoing abstract are more 

 or less at variance with the characters of Percoid fishes, even as the family 

 was accepted by Dr. Dekay ; the doubt of the reader is still more increased 

 when he finds it stated that the ' ' branchial membrane (is) large, extending loosely 

 around the throat, with six rays, and that the ventrals arise near the inferior fold 

 of the branchial membrane, and are composed of two long articulated rays and a 

 short rudimentary one on each side." 



This condition of the branchial membrane, this number of ventral rays are 

 so different from the characters of the true Percoids, that one can have no 

 hesitation in denying a fish with such attributes a place in the family. As in 

 all those as well as in minor details, it agrees with Labrosomus, it is unhesita- 

 tingly referred to that genus. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



The genus Lepisoma has heen adopted hy the following authors, but it is 

 necessary to add, entirely on the authority of Dr. Dekay. 



Troschel has translated into German the characters of the genus for the 

 " Archiv fur Naturgeschichte " of 1844, page 233. He has questioned the pre- 

 sence of three ventral rays. 



Dr. Storer, in his ' ' Synopsis of the Fishes of North America, ' ' has adopted 

 it without qualification. 



Sir John Richardson, in the article '' Ichthyology " of the last edition of the 

 "Encyclopedia Britannica," at page 277 of the twelfth volume, has taken the 

 characters of the genus from the "Archiv," and on account of the presence of 

 six branchiostegal rays, places it, together with Boleosoma and Pileoma, at the 

 end of his family of Theraponidce, but adds that he "cannot, without more 

 data, fix their proper place in the system." 



No notice has been taken of the genus Labrosomus, except in a reference of 

 Lepisoma cirrhosum Dekay to it, in a recent number of the Proceedings of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences. That this is entitled to distinction appears 

 to be evident, and its characters are now given.

There can scarcely remain a doubt of the identity of the Lepisoma cir rh o- 

 s u m of Dr. Dekay with the Labrosomus pectinifer. The only difference 

 between the description of Dekay and that of Valenciennes, is respecting the 



1S60.] 




103 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



orbital and nuchal filaments. The orbital filaments are stated by Dr. Dekay to 

 "subdivide into six or eight smaller processes, each of which terminate in 

 several slender filaments, not thicker than the finest thread;" Valenciennes 

 describes them as divided to their base in ten or twelve slender filaments. 

 Dr. Dekay informs us that the nuchal filaments are nine or ten on each side, 

 each bifid or trifid ; Valenciennes describes them as being arranged in two 

 pectiniform rows, each row consisting of thirty or more. 



Another variation of Lepisoma cirrhosum from Labrosomus pectinifer 

 is concerning the vomero-palatine dentition ; Dekay mentions that "in the 

 upper jaw, in front, is a series of equal, conical, slightly recurved teeth, some- 

 what longer than those below, smaller on the sides ; behind the outer row, in 

 front, is a patch of minute crowded teeth. Similar teeth in bands on the 

 vomer and palates. On the anterior part of the vomer is a very large solitary 

 tooth." This description of the vomerine and palatine teeth is ambiguous, 

 and may be variously interpreted. If by it is meant that the vomero-palatine 

 teeth are in several rows, or in a villiform band, it widely disagrees with the 

 Labrosomus pectinifer. In the latter species there is but one row of stout 

 conic teeth, like those of the outer row of the upper jaw, with " a very large 

 solitary tooth on the anterior part of the vomer." A figure is given of the 

 dentition of the Lepisoma cirrhosum, but very little reliance can be 

 placed on it. The vomerine and palatine teeth are certainly represented as 

 pluriserial, but there is no "very large solitary tooth " represented on the 

 vomer. A doubt may therefore arise respecting the propriety of referring 

 Lepisoma cirrhosum to Labrosomus pectinifer. Considering, however, 

 that the description of the former, in all respects except those above men- 

 tioned, agrees with the latter ; that the number of rays is almost exactly 

 similar ; that in each, a larger tooth is at the front of the vomer, and that the 

 description and figure of the dentition of Lepisoma c i r r h o s u m do not agree 

 with each other ; it appears almost certain that the two belong tothe same 

 species, and that error has entered into the description and illustration of the 

 species as well as in the allocation of the genus. 



The Labrosomus pectinifer is widely distributed through the Caribbean 

 Sea, and is found at the Islands of Barbados, Trinidad, St. Thomas, Jamaica, 

 Cuba, as well as at the Bahama Islands and on the coast of Florida. 



The specimens from which Valenciennes described the species were obtained 

 at Brazil and at Bahia. A specimen from Brazil does not specifically differ 

 from West Indian ones. 



Valenciennes even observes that it is one of the small number of species 

 that cross the Atlantic ocean. A specimen is stated by him to have been ob- 

 tained by Adanson among the rocks of the Island of Gorea, in January, 1750.

Clinus fasciatus Castelnau, Animaux nouveaux ou rares recueilles, &c, 

 dans l'Amerique du sud. Poissons, p. 26, pi. xii. fig. 2, 1855. 



This species is very closely related to the Labrosomus pectinifer Sw., 

 and it was at first believed that it was probably only a variety. My friend, J. 

 C. Brevoort, Esq., has since sent me an outline of the figure of Castelnau and 

 a copy of his description, and I am now disposed to regard it as a true species. 



The Labrosomus pectinifer is sometimes found with four dark brown 

 vertical bars, between which are smaller and more obscure ones, interrupted 

 at the middle. Such appears to have been the variety mentioned by Drs. 

 Miiller and Troschel in their list of the Fishes collected by Sir Robert Schom- 

 burgh at the island of Barbados, and published in the "Annals and ]\4agazine 

 of Natural History" and the History of Barbados. This variety, in every 

 other respect, resembles typical individuals of the species, and has, like them, 

 the rays of the caudal and pectoral fins covered with five or six rows of spots. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 107 



111 the normal variety of the Labrosomus pectinifer, the bauds, although 

 present, are faint and confused. 



The Labrosomus fasciatus, from the figure and description of Castlenau, 

 appears to differ from the L. pectinifer or its variety, by the absence of 

 the intermediate, interrupted and fainter bands, and of the rows of spots on 

 the caudal, by the red color of the abdomen and opercula, and of the ventral, 

 pectoral and caudal fins, as well as of the broad marginal band of the soft por- 

 tion of the dorsal fin. The following is the description given by Castlenau : 



" Ressemble pour la forme au pectinifer, et a une tache semblable a Poper- 

 oule. Le corps est d'un brun clair avec quatre, larges bandes transversales 

 d'un brun tres obscur ; l'opercule, la gorge, la partie inferieure de la tete et 

 la moitie anterieure des dessons du corps sont d'un beau rouge vix ; les 

 nageoires anale et ventrale sont de cette ratine couleur.

The Labrosomus capillatus is recorded as an inhabitant of the same

 differs from it by the immaculate pectoral fins, and the spot on the operculum 

 is bordered with white. 



4. Labrosomus X a n t i Gill. 



This species in form and proportions is very nearly allied to Labrosomus 

 pectinifer. 



It attains a length of about six inches. Of the length, the head, from the 

 front row of teeth to the margin of the operculum forms a fourth part, and 

 the caudal fin about a seventh. The greatest height is rather less than the 

 head's length. The dorsal outline from the nape to the posterior third of the 

 dorsal fin is nearly straight and scarcely convex, and thence gradually declines 

 in a slight curve to the end of the fin, when the height of the caudal peduncle 

 is scarcely more than a fourth of the length of the head. 



The profile from the eyes to the snout slopes more gradually than in Labro- 

 somus pectinifer, and the suborbital is less broad. 



The dorsal commences behind the vertical of the preopercle, and the spines 

 regularly increase in height towards the middle of the spinous portion, and 

 thence slightly decrease towards the soft portion, which is almost twice as high 

 as the last spine. 



The pectoral fins are produced at its middle rays, and their length is equal 

 to nearly a fifth of that of the body. The articulated rays of all the fins are 

 simple and unbranched as in its congener.

The color of the body is brown, crossed by about ten darker bands. The 

 head is dotted with blackish, and from the posterior and inferior borders of 

 the eye, two bands proceed obliquely to the margin of the preopercle. The 

 opercle is darker than the preopercle, but there is no black spot. The dorsal 

 has the basal portion of the membrane between the first and third spines 

 blackish ; the rest of the n en brane is tinged with purple, but immaculate. 

 The basal half of the fin is covered with scales as in Labrosomus pectinifer. 

 The anal fin is crossed by six ob^que purplish bands. The caudal, pectorals 

 and ventrals are immaculate.

This species is very nearly allied to the "West Indian Labrosomus p e c t i n i- 

 fer and L. capillatus Sw., hut differs from them in color and some minor 

 details of form. The median tooth of the front of the vomer, which is so 

 large in the Labrosomus pectinifer, is of the same size as the others in 

 the Labrosomus x a n t i. 



Old and young specimens were obtained by Mr. J. Xantus under rocks on 

 Cerro Blanco. They are numbered 2334, 2335 and 2478 in the collection of 

 the Smithsonian Institution. 



I have dedicated this species to Mr. Xantus as a slight testimony to his 

 worth and abilities : while engaged in his duties on the coast survey, and with 

 many obstacles to contend against, on account of the present condition of af- 

 fairs in Mexico, he has obtained a collection of terrestrial and marine animals, 

 which is rich in new forms, and all the species of which are in the highest 

 state of preservation.

This species appears to be nearly related to the other species of the genus, but 

 is distinguished by the presence of only sixteen spines in the dorsal fin, and by 

 a different pattern of coloration. The dorsal fin anteriorly has an elongate 

 black spot. "The cheeks and head are rufous brown, vermicular with little 

 blackish lines, which form an irregular kind of close net work."

Monograph of the Genus LABRAX, of Cuvier. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



There is found, in the Mediterranean sea, a fish which has, from the earliest 

 times, attracted the attention of the inhabitants of the neighboring coasts from 

 the abundance in which it is found and the size to which it attains. By the 

 Ancients, as at the present day, it was much esteemed as an article of food, and 

 was called by the Greeks A*/?/>*| and by the Romans, Lupus. Of this fish. 

 Cuvier has said that its appearance and almost all the details of its form recall 

 to mind the perch, and that a just idea would be given of it by describing it as 

 a " large, elongated and silvery perch." 



From the Perches, however, it differs in several characters, which induced 

 Cuvier to separate it generically, and for the name of the genus, he adopted the 

 Greek designation of the species. The characters by which Cuvier distinguished 

 it from the Perches were the presence of teeth on the tongue and of two spines to 

 the operculum. It differs also from the true Perches in the armature of some 

 of its bones, and by the shorter spinous dorsal fin, whose rays, in the European 

 and allied American species, do not exceed the number of nine. 



Though Cuvier was the first to properly distinguish the genus, its type bad 

 been long previously placed by Klein as the first of two species which he placed 

 in a group, for which he used the same name of Labrax. 



In the second and third volumes of the great " Histoire Naturelle des 

 Poissons," Cuvier and Valenciennes have referred to the genus Labrax seven 

 species, six of which are described in the former volume. 



Of these, the Labrax 1 u p u s is the type of the genus, and is distinguished by 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 109 



the spur-like spines of the inferior margin of the preoperculum ; the presence 

 of a perfect marginal band of teeth and of an oval basal patch on the tongue ; 

 three spines to the anal fin. and other characters which will be noticed in the 

 diagnosis of the genus. To this should the name of Labrax be restricted. 



The second species (le Bar alonge, or Perca elongata of Geoffrey) is distin- 

 guished by finer and more numerous teeth on the inferior border of the preoper- 

 culum, and the presence of only two anal spines. This is doubtless the type of 

 a distinct genus to which the name of Dicentrarchus may be given. 



The third species is the Labrax lineatus of Cuvier, the common rock fish 

 and striped bass of the United States. This is now taken as the type of a new 

 genus, for which Mitchell's name of Roccua is preserved. The characters are 

 given below. To this genus should be also referred the Labrax multiline- 

 atus described by Cuvier and Valenciennes in the third volume of their 

 "Histoire." 



The fourth species, Labrax Waigiensis, has been identified by Bleeker 

 with the Psammoperca datnioides of Richardson; if this is correct, and 

 notwithstanding the discrepancies between the descriptions of the "Histoire 

 Naturelle" and Richardson, such appears to be the case it belongs to a very 

 distinct genus from Labrax 1 u pu s . The teeth of the jaws, vomer and palatines 

 are described by Richardson as crowded, rounded and granular, while by Cuvier 

 the teeth on both jaws, the chevron of the vomer and the palatines are said to be 

 villiform (" dents en velours "); it is also stated by Cuvier that there is a small 

 oval disc at the base of the tongue. By Richardson, the tongue is said to be 

 smooth. In the latter statement, however, be disagrees not only with Cuvier 

 and Valenciennes, but with Bleeker, who also asserts* that there is an oblong 

 patch at the base of the tongue; " lingua basi thurma denticulorum scabra." 

 Both authors agree as to the presence of a single spine to the operculum 

 (although one of the generic characters assigned to Labrax by Cuvier is the 

 presence of two spines on that bone), and of a strong horizontal spine at the 

 angle of the preoperculum, above which the margin is pectinated. 



The next species in order, Labrax Japonic us of Cuv. and Val., is the 

 type of the genus Lateolabrax of Bleeker, which is widely separated from 

 Labrax by the absence of any teeth on the tongue. In the plectroid armature 

 of the operculum it, however, resembles that genus. 



The last species Labrax mucronatu s is now taken as the type of a new 

 genus, for which the name of Morone is accepted. Its generic characters and 

 affinities will be given at length in a subsequent portion of this memoir. 



Of the seven species referred by Cuvier and Valenciennes to the genus Labrax, 

 six are thus seen to belong to different genera. Nor do any of these genera 

 appear to be unnecessary, but on the contrary, all of them are well distinguished 

 from each other by characters that ichthyologists must admit are of importance ; 

 two of the species, indeed, that were referred to the genus by the French nat- 

 uralists, do not agree with their characters of that genus. It is not in dispar- 

 agement of those celebrated and able men that these remarks have been made. 

 The progress of scientific discovery and the examination of better materials 

 have enabled their successors to discover the errors of the founders of modern 

 ichthyology. None could have performed the work at that day better than they. 

 Having long since, from an examination of the descriptions of various 

 authors, been aware of the confusion and uncertainty in which our American 

 species of the Cuvieran Labrax were enveloped, I have thought that it might be 

 a useful task to attempt the elucidation of the genus. More than three years 

 ago, I had noticed that the Labrax rufus of Dekay belonged to a different 

 natural genus from Labrax, but not having then had an opportunity of exam- 

 ining the European species, I believed that the Labrax lineatus was a true 

 Labrax. The name which I had then applied to the Labrax rufus having 

 never been published, I have now renounced it for that of Mitchell, not b :^use

110 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



he was the author of the genus, but because the name had been applied; 

 though from a false idea, to one of its species. 



The number of American species admitted by Drs. Dekay and Storer in the 

 genus Labrax amounts to seven, and another specific name has been since added 

 by Filippi, an Italian naturalist. It will be attempted to demonstrate, in the 

 following monograph, that all of these nominal species are referrable to three 

 true ones. Three of the synonyms apply to one species and four to another. 



Besides the species that have been attributed to the genus by Richardson. 

 Dekay and Filippi, several others have been described under that name by 

 modern naturalists. Dr. Charles Girard has noticed two of these in the "Pro- 

 ceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia," under the name 

 of Labrax n eb u 1 o s u s and L. clathratus. He afterwards constructed 

 for them a new genus which he called Paralabrax, and placed it in the vicinity 

 of Serranus. They appear truly to belong there, or perhaps to the group com- 

 posed of Elastoma Sw., or Macrops Dumeril, and Etelis Cuv. 



Mr. Hill, of Jamaica, in a useful catalogue of the Fishes of that island, has 

 also noticed a fish which he referred to Labrax, under the name of L. p 1 u v i a - 

 lis, or the rainy weather chub. It is said by that gentleman to be confounded 

 by the fishermen with the Labrax mucronatus, but differs from it by the 

 presence of vertical bars, like those of the common perch of Europe and America. 

 Is not this related to the Perca P 1 u m i e r i of Cuvier and Valenciennes ? The 

 presence of the vertical bars would militate against its natural association with 

 Morone, and it may perhaps be the type of a distinct genus or belong to the 

 genus Percichthys of Girard 



For the faculties of investigating inf) the history of this group I am indebted 

 to the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.

The genus Labrax, as above restricted, is chiefly distinguished by the contin- 

 uous band of villiform teeth around the margin of the tongue, and the oval 

 disc at its base. It is most intimately allied to the genus Roccus, from which it 

 is separated by the character of the lingual dentition and the plectroid inferior 

 -margin of the preoperculum ; the latter character is seen in the less nearly 

 allied genus, Lateolabrax of Bleeker. 



But a single species of this genus is yet known.

 The full synonymy of this species can be ascertained by reference to the

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



"Fauna Italica" of the Prince of Canino; as it has been given by Cuvier aa 

 well as Canino, it is not necessary to more than refer to it here. 



As many names bad been given to the species before it was designated 

 Labrax lupus by Cuvier, that name cannot be retained if we are to be guided 

 by the rules of priority. A specific name given to it by Bloch is therefore 

 adopted. 



In the edition of the " Systema Naturre " by Gmelin, the European Lalraz 

 appears under the name of Perca punctata. Cuvier and Valenciennes have 

 shown that this name is only a misapplication of one by Linnaeus, who had 

 given it to a Scisenoid from North America, which he placed immediately before 

 the Perca labrax in his System. Gmelin, in his edition of the same work, 

 has by mistake omitted both the description of the Linnsean Perca punctata 

 and the name of Perca labrax, so that the name of the former is there ap- 

 plied to the description of the latter. Bloch has also applied the name of 

 Perca punctata to the young of Labrax diacanthus, but without allu- 

 sion to the names of Linnasus or Gmelin. As the name thus applied would 

 have at that time conflicted with the one of Linnasus, it should not be retained. 

 The name of Sciasna diacantha coming next in order, its specific part must 

 be adopted. Although the name of Lupus was bestowed on this species by the 

 ancient Romans, that does not appear to constitute a valid reason for accepting 

 it as a scientific name.

112 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



The genu3 Roccus is very closely allied to both Labrax, as here revised, and 

 Morone. From Labrax it differs chiefly in the character of the armature of the 

 preoperculum, and by the absence of the teeth at the anterior extremity of the 

 tongue; the whole margin of the tongue in the latter genus being provided 

 with a band of villiform teeth, and the spur-formed teeth of the inferior margin 

 of the preoperculum calling to mind the genus Plectropoma of Cuvier among the 

 Serrani. The difference between the last named genus or at least of many of 

 its species and Serranus is indeed not of as great value as that between Labrax 

 and Roccus. The only constant character between Serranus and Plectropoma, as 

 those genera were established by Cuvier, is the spur-like dentition of the 

 inferior border of the preoperculum, while Labrax and Roccus are distinguished 

 not only by an equally great and constant difference of the preopercular border, 

 but also by the difference of the lingual dentition. As the former character is 

 of as great value in the Labraces as in the Serrani, consistency will require that 

 if Plectropoma and Serranus are considered as distinct genera, Roccus and Labrax 

 should also be so regarded. 



The difference between Roccus and Morone is of even more importance than 

 that of Roccus and Labrax. The distinguishing characters will be referred to 

 under the diagnosis of Morone. 



The name which has been adopted for this genus is one given by Dr. Mitchell, 

 in the year 1814, to a medley comprising the Roccus lineatus, which he 

 called Roccus s tr i at u s , and the Otolithus re gal is, which was designated 

 as Roccus comes. The name was solely the result of ignorance on the part 

 of the author, of the application of the ordinary terms used by naturalists at 

 that day. The name itself is a barbarous latinization of the popular name, 

 rock fish, by which its chief species is known in many parts of the United 

 States. Notwithstanding these facts, it has been nevertheless deemed more 

 advisable to accept the name than to apply a new one. It is scarcely worse 

 than Raltus, Kangurus, Catus, Gunnellus, and many other names of similar 

 derivation. 



Rafinesque, in the " Ichthyologia Ohiensis," also proposed for his Perca 

 chrysops, in case it should be found to be generically distinct from Perca, 

 the name of Lepibema. He believed it to be distinguished " by the scaly bases 

 of the caudal, anal and second dorsal fins, the last with some spiny rays, and 

 all the three parts of the gill cover more or less serrulate, besides the small 

 teeth." Rafinesque suggested that to this genus the Perca Mite belli of 

 Mitchell might " perhaps be found to belong." 



The genus Roccus may be divided into two sections.

This species is so well known and has been so frequently described and 

 figured that no description is here needed. The best that has appeared is that 

 of Holbrook in the Ichthyology of South Carolina; in that, the only correct 

 account of the lingual dentition published by any American author, is given. 

 The best illustration of the species is given by Sonrel in Dr. Storer's " History 

 of the Fishes of Massachusetts," and is superior to that of Dr. Holbrook. 



Cuvier and Valenciennes have described the tongue as having asperities only 

 en its sides, while other naturalists have stated that the teeth on the tongue are 

 most obvious on its sides," or more correctly that the "tongue is rough at its 

 base and upon its sides and smooth in the centre." Dr. Holbrook has well said 

 that "there are two bands of minute teeth, at the root of the tongue, separated 

 slightly from each other in the mesial line ; the sides of the tongue are also 

 armed with small teeth." 



Prof. Filippi, a learned naturalist of Turin, has also correctly described the 

 lingual dentition of Roccus lineatus in comparison with a species of the 

 genus which he regarded as new, but which has, in this monograph, been con- 

 sidered as identical with the Roccus chrysops.

The Roccus chrysops of this monograph is undoubtedly identical with 

 the Perca or Lepibema chrysops of Rafinesque, and the Labrax multi- 

 lineatus of the " Histoire Naturelle des Poissons" and of Kirtland. The 

 descriptions that have been yet given of the species under those names are 

 meagre and unsatisfactory, but the notice of the color given bv the above

114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



named authors and the possession of specimens from the same hydrographical 

 basins as those from whence the fishes described by them were taken, leave no 

 doubt as to the identity of the species. 



Rafinesque's description of his Perca chrysops is, like almost all his des- 

 criptions, inapplicable to any known fish, but it agrees with the Morone 

 chrysops better than any other species. Rafinesque erroneously attributes 

 to his species six branchiostegal rays, a single opercular spine, eight spines to 

 the first dorsal fin, and places it under the genus Perca, all the species of which , 

 he informs us, have naked heads. He proposed for it a new genus to which he 

 gave the name Lepibema, in allusion to the scaly bases of the unpaired fins. 



Lesueur subsequently sent to the Parisian Museum two specimens of a species 

 which he called Perca multilineata, which Cuvier and Valenciennes 

 placed in their genus Labrax, but adopted for it the specific name of Lesueur. 

 Their description is mostly comparative, it being said to differ from the Labrax 

 lineatus by its higher body, shorter head, more feeble teeth, the stronger 

 asperities of the tongue, and especially the larger scales of the maxillaries, 

 which resemble those of Labrax mucronatus, while in Labrax lineatus 

 they were said to be scarcely perceptible. 



The description of the lingual dentition is very unsatisfactory, and no cor- 

 rection is made of the statement made in the second volume that the Labrax 

 lineatus has only lateral teeth. It is not in the development of the asperi- 

 ties of the tongue that the lingual dentition of the species differs, but that while 

 there are two narrow rows separated by a mesial line in Roccus lineatus, 

 the rows are broader at the middle, in proportion, and coalescent in Roccus 

 chrysops. 



There were said to be in one specimen sixteen, and in another, nineteen 

 longitudinal dark lines. So large a number is rarely seen ; the most constant 

 arrangement is five above, including the one through which the lateral line 

 runs, while sometimes there are several below the lateral line, and at other 

 times they are obsolete. These lines are sometimes straight, but often in- 

 terrupted. 



In the "Fauna Boreali-Americana " of Richardson, a Labrax is described in 

 the volume on Ichthyology, under the name of Labrax not at us (Smith), the 

 Bar-fish or Canadian Basse." This species is said to " differ from Mitchell's 

 Basse (L. lineatus Cuv.) in being much more robust, and in being marked 

 with rows of spots, five above and five below the lateral line, so regularly in- 

 terrupted and transposed as to appear like ancient church music." It has been 

 suggested by Dr. Dekay that it is the same as the Perca Mitchelli, var. 

 interrupt us of Mitchell, but the comparison will apply very well to Roccus 

 chrysops, and it is doubtless identical with that species. In the remarks 

 upon the species, it is said by Dr. Richardson apparently that "in the more 

 robust form, and in the strong scales of the head, the Canadian Bar-fish resem- 

 bles the L. mucronatus of the United States and the West Indies, and the 

 L. multilineatus of the Wabash. The latter has sixteen narrow, black, 

 longitudinal lines on the flanks." It has been attempted to show that the 

 number of lines is not a specific character, and if this is the case, the Labrax 

 n o t a t u s and L. multilineatus are probably identical with each other 

 and with Roccus chrysops. The Labrax not at us, it is true, is stated 

 by Smith to have but one anal spine and six articulated ventral rays, but this 

 statement is undoubtedly due to a lapsus calami or ati error of observation. So 

 great a variation, in the number of anal spines, from a nearly allied species, 

 would be in direct opposition to all we know of the peculiarities of the fishes 

 of this tribe, while it is one of the characters of the family to have only five 

 branched rays in the ventral fins. Smith states that he counted fifty-eight 

 scales along the lateral line, a statement which confirms the identity of this 

 . species with Roccus chrysops. 



In the abstracts of Smith's description of Labrax notatus, given by Dekay 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



and Storer, tbe species is said to have the "length, one to two feet." If this 

 was so, it might militate against the idea of its identity with Itoccus chry- 

 sops, but an examination of the description of Smith and Richardson reveals 

 no mention whatever of the size of the species. 



In the number of Guerin's " Revue et Magazin de Zoologie," for April, 1853, 

 (vol. v. p. 164,) Professor Filippi, of Turin, has described a Roccus to which he 

 has given the name of Labrax s c u 1 a t i i , a traveller in America, M. Oscu- 

 lati, having obtained it from Lake Ontario. Filippi has distinguisbed this 

 species from Labrax line at us very well, alluding to the two longitudinal 

 lines of basal teeth in that species, and attributing to his own a single oval 

 patch. His other characters are the greater heighth of the body in L. Oscu- 

 latii, which equals a third of the length, while ia L. line at us it is a 



9 

 quarter; and the number of scales, which are formulated as 56 for L. 



9 15 



Osculatii, and 64 for L. 1 in ea tu s . The true teeth are also said to 



11 

 be more numerous. The distinctive characters of the species are very well 

 stated by Filippi, but his expression of surprise that a fish so common in the 

 United States should not have been noticed by any American naturalist, not 

 even by Dr. Dekay, is uncalled for. Unhappily, the species had been too often 

 noticed, and in Dekay's Ichthyology of New York it appears under no less than 

 three different names. Filippi has mentioned its habitat as the sea and rivers 

 of the United States (Mare et fluviis confederationis Americanse). I know not 

 on what authority it is said to inhabit the sea; it is probably assumed to be 

 found there because the Roccus li neat us is. So far as we now know, it is 

 confined to the great fresh water lakes and the Western rivers. 



Specimens of the Roccus chrysops are in the Museum of the Smithsonian 

 Institution, from southern Illinois, obtained by Mr. Robert Kennicott, and from 

 the Root river at Racine, Wisconsin, Toronto, &c, obtained by Professor Baird. 



The specimens from the hydrographical basins of the Ohio river and of the 

 Great Lakes cannot be specifically distinguished from each other. Nor can I 

 perceive the difference signalized by Dr. Kirtland in the caudal fins of Ohio and 

 Lake Erie specimens. 



In extreme youth, this species appears to be crossed by obscure vertical 

 bands; at a later epoch these bands are lost, and afterwards the longitudinal 

 lines are assumed. 



The best descriptions of this species have been published by Prof. Filippi 

 under the name of Labrax Osculatii, and by the late Dr. Dekay under that 

 of Labrax albidus. The best figure is that given by Dr. Kirtland in the 

 Journal of the Boston Society of Natural History, but the dorsals are errone- 

 ously represented as being connected by a low membrane. In the text they are 

 correctly described as being " distinct."

The chief distinctive characters of the genus are the presence of strongly 

 pectinated scales on the cheeks and opercular bones, and the band of villiforni 

 teeth on the sides and of more scattered ones at the tip. 



In the armature of the preoperculum and operculum, it resembles the genus 

 Eoccus. In the connection of the dorsal fins at the base, the less allied Pacific 

 genera Lateolabrax of Bleeker, and Psammoperca of Richardson. The slightly 

 gibbous back in front of the dorsal fin, and the greater developement of the 

 second anal spine are secondary features, which support the natural characters 

 of Morone as distinguished from the genus Roccus. 



For the name of the genus, one used by Mitchell for a group founded in 

 error, has been adopted. The name of Mitchell resulted from a misunder- 

 standing of that author regarding the value of the terms made use of by Lin- 

 naeus. The genus Perca was placed by the Swedish naturalist in his section 

 of Thoracic!; Mitchell, believing that the Morone americana, Perca Ha- 

 ve s c e n s and Pomotis macula t us were rather abdominal fishes, considered 

 them to be generically distinct from Perca, and consequently gave to them the 

 generic name of Morone. It is scarcely necessary to state that all the species 

 enumerated have the normal position of the ventrals of Perca, and that there- 

 fore Morone of Mitchell was a mere synonyme of Perca of Linnaeus. I have 

 nevertheless preferred to take that name rather than to give a new one.

In the above synonymy, it will be observed that several species which have 

 been created as distinct, and so retained by succeeding naturalists, have been 

 merged into one. Although there can scarcely be a doubt of the identity of 

 these nominal species, the synonymy, at the same time, has been divided into 

 three portions, each applying to one of the nominal species as previously 

 accepted. 



The reference of all the variations of the Labrax americanus type to 

 one species has been only done after a careful study of Dekay's descriptions, 

 and after examination of numerous specimens of the genus. The descriptions 

 of Dekay certainly do not afford any means for distinguishing his species, in 

 the case of Labrax rufus and Labrax nigricans, except a very slight 

 difference in the shade of color. The description of the color of the latter 

 species is given by Dekay, as follows : 



" The general hue is deep brownish-black, more intense on the head ami 

 upper part of the body. In the older specimens, there is a strong brassy hue 

 throughout ; occasionally dark longitudinal parallel streaks on the upper part 

 of the body, pupils black, irides yellow, base of the fins light greenish- yellow, 

 edge of the membrane of the spinous dorsal, black ; upper portion of the 

 membrane of the posterior dorsal fin transparent, and separated from the 

 yellow portion at the base by a tolerably well defined dark band ; membrane 

 of the anal fin dark toward the tips of the rays. ' ' 



Let any naturalist take an ordinary specimen of the common white perch, 

 and decide whether the difference of color between that specimen and the 

 Labrax nigricans is sufficient to authorize a separation on that ground ; 

 in all other respects, the description of Dr. Dekay will exactly apply to his 

 Labrax rufus. 



The distribution of the darker shades of color on the body and fins, is the 

 same in both species ; the proportions are the same, and the difference in the 

 number of rays is not greater than is noticed in the same species. Is it not 

 probable that Dr. Dekay was induced to separate the Labrax nigricans 

 from his other species on account of a supposed difference of station ? The 

 Labrax rufus is described as being "obtained in brackish streams," while 

 the Labrax nigricans is said to be found in " deep fresh-water ponds in 

 Queen and Suffolk Counties." But the true Labrax rufus {Morone ameri- 

 cana) is found also in streams of fresh water, and in ponds that are now en- 

 tirely disconnected from the salt water, although not far from the sea. As 

 there is therefore no difference in the habitation of the supposed two species, 

 and as no specific distinctions appear to exist from the descriptions of Dr. 

 Dekay, no alternative is left but to consider them identical. 



Mr. William H. Herbert, a popular writer on our fi- lies, entertained <: great 

 doubts " whether the Labrax nigricans was more "than a casual variety of 

 I860.] 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



the Black Bass of the Saint Lawrence, " the " Grystes nigricans of Agassiz. " 

 Such doubts deserve no consideration, as there are none of its being at least 

 the congener of Morone americana. 



As to the Labrax pallidus, there is a greater discrepancy in the descrip- 

 tion of it as compared with that of the Labrax r u f u s . It is said that in the 

 former, the opercle has " a single flat spine, and a pointed membrane extend- 

 ing beyond it," while the generic characters given by Cuvier to the genus are 

 retained, one of which is founded upon the presence of "two points on the 

 opercle." The statement that Labrax pallidus has but one spine is pro- 

 bably due to a misapprehension of Dekay. In the Morone americana 

 there is one acute point terminating the opercle, above which is an emargina- 

 tion separating it from a more obtuse or rounded process, which in one case 

 has been regarded as a spine, and in the other has not. It is impossible to 

 believe that two fishes of this genus so nearly resembling each other, should 

 so differ in the developement of the opercular spines. 



Another distinctive character is said to exist in the first ray of the posterior 

 dorsal, which is " nearly as long as the second." Was not this relative differ- 

 ence in the proportions of the rays the result of injury to the tips of the suc- 

 ceeding soft ones ? As a third character, it is mentioned that the body is 

 " much compressed." From the figures of Labrax rufus and Labrax pal- 

 lidus, it would appear that any difference in height was rather in favor of 

 the former than of the latter. No mention is made in the description, of the 

 color of the fins of Labrax pallidus, but from the figure it would appear 

 that the pattern is nearly the same in that species as in Labrax rufus, but 

 the shade is lighter towards the borders of the dorsal and anal. This differ- 

 ence is too trivial to be accepted as specific, and if the above conjectures as to 

 the nature of Dr. Dekay's statements are correct, the Labrax pallidus 

 must be regarded as a mere s vnonyme of Morone americana.

 non Roccus chrysops Gill. 



The form of this species scarcely differs from the Morone americana, 

 the chief difference existing in the more gradual declination of the dorsal out- 

 line to the end of the second dorsal fin, and the greater inequality of the an- 

 terior and posterior portions of the caudal peduncle. The greatest height of 

 the body equals three-tenths of the length from the snout to the concave mar- 

 gin of the caudal fin ; of that length, the head forms almost three-tenths, 

 being not much less than the height of the body, and the caudal fin, at its mid- 

 dle rays, equals half of the height of the body. The caudal fin, when expanded,^ 

 is emarginated and its angles rounded ; the shortest rays equal three-fifths of 

 the length of the longest. 



The dorsal fin commences at a vertical intermediate between the bases of 

 the pectoral and ventral fins, and is of a triangular form, the fourth ray being 

 the largest, and equalling the length of the pectoral fin ; the spines have the 

 same form and arrangement as those of Morone americana. The second 

 dorsal is connected by a membrane as in Morone americana; its spinous 

 or first i ay is little more than half the length of the first articulated one, which 

 itself is nearly as long as the fourth dorsal spine ; the fin thence decreases in 

 height towards its last ray, which is shorter than its spinous one. 



The anal fin commences under the fourth or fifth articulated ray of the 

 second dorsal, and about four of its rays are posterior to the termination of 

 that fin ; the first spine is short and robust ; the second at least twice as long 

 as the first, compressed, and very strong ; the third is as long or longer than the 

 second, but much more slender. The first articulated ray of the anal is 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 119 



longer than the spines, and about twice as long as the last ; the outline of the 

 fin is slightly emarginated. 



The first ray of the pectoral fin is, as usual, articulated but simple ; the 

 third is longest and branched, and equals the base of the second dorsal. 



The ventrals are about as long as the pectorals ; the length of the spine is 

 equal to two-thirds of that of the first or second branched rays. 



The radial formula is as follows : 



D ix I, 12 ; A hi, 10 ; C 4, I, 8, 7, I, 2 ; P 3, 14 ; V i, 5. 



The scales are of about the same size as in the Morone americana, the 

 lateral line running through about fifty, besides the smaller ones at the base 

 of the caudal fin ; at the region of its greatest height, there are about nineteen 

 rows, of which about seven are above the lateral line and eleven beneath. The 

 relative proportions on the different parts of the body are almost nearly the 

 same as in that species, the chief difference existing on the front of the back, 

 where the exposed portions of the disc are higher and narrower than in M. 

 americana. On the cheeks from the orbit to the angles, there are about 

 seven oblique rows. 



The specimens preserved in spirits have a bright brazen color, tinged on the 

 back with olivaceous. Along the sides are seven very distinct longitudinal 

 black bands, through the fourth of which the lateral line runs for its entire 

 length. The continuity of the bands below the lateral line is interrupted at 

 the posterior half of their length, and they there alternate with their anterior 

 parts. 



The dorsal fins are tinged with purple, and the margin of the spinous one is 

 dark. The anal is of a darker purple towards its anterior angle. The caudal, 

 especially posteriorly and at its middle, is purple. The rays of the pectoral 

 and ventral fins are yellowish, while the membrane of the former is hyaline, 

 and of the latter sometimes minutely dotted. 



This species, as will be observed by reference to the synonymy, has been 

 described by Dr. Charles Girard, under the name of Labrax chrysops Grd. 

 (Perca or Lepibema chrysops Raf.), to which is also referred as a syno- 

 nyme, the Labrax multilineatus of Cuvier and Valenciennes, Kirtland, 

 Dekay and Storer. From that species, it is very distinct, and even belongs to 

 a different genus. Cuvier described the ground color as a greenish-gray 

 on the back and silvery on the belly. This is not the color of Morone inter- 

 rupta, and that species must be therefore distinct from Labrax multi- 

 lineatus, nor can it be the Perca chrysops of Rafinesque, which is 

 said to be " silvery with five longitudinal brownish stripes on each side," and 

 have the "head brown above." This description, though erroneous in most 

 respects, is as accurate as Rafinesque's generally are, and agrees sufficiently 

 well with Kirtland's Labrax multilineatus, which is doubtless identical 

 with the Cuvieran species. Even such an observer as Rafinesque would have 

 noticed the deep brazen hue of Morone interrupta, and would not have 

 overlooked two of the seven very distinct black bands that run along the sides. 



Dr. Girard has stated that there are but six branchiostegal rays in his species, 

 but I am able to say, from an examination of the specimens used by Dr. Girard 

 himself, for description, that it agrees with all allied species, in having the 

 normal number of seven, and which are developed as in Morone americana. 



There are preserved in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, three 

 specimens of the Morone interrupta, one of which was obtained by 

 Lieutenant Couch, at New Orleans, and two larger ones were found at St. Louis, 

 Missouri, by Dr. George Engelman. The small specimen from New Orleans 

 differs from the two Missouri specimens by the larger second spine of the anal 

 fin, but in every other respect they are similar.

120 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Monograph of the Philypni. 

 BY THEO. GILL. 



I. In the year 1837, M. Valenciennes has for the first time separated from 

 the genus Eleotris of Gronovius, a fish which had been previously referred by 

 Schneider, Lacepede and by Cuvier, to genera to which it did not naturally 

 belong. 



This species was first named Platycephalus dormitator, in Schneider's 

 posthumous edition of the " Systema Ichthyologise " of Bloch, from the figure 

 and manuscript description of the Father Plumier. 



Shortly after, M. Lacepede, upon the same documents, established his 

 Gobioniore d o r m e u r . The genus to which it was referred was distinguished 

 by M. Lacepede from the genus Gobius, by the separation of the ventral fins. 

 The group was thus established on the same characters as those by which 

 Cuvier afterwards separated the species under the Gronovian name of Eleotris, 

 but the homogeneousness of the group was destroyed by the introduction of 

 species which had no affinity to the Eleotroids. 



Subsequently, Cuvier, in his " Regne Animal," revised the characters of 

 the genus Eleotris, and introduced among true species of the genus, the Eleo- 

 tris dormitatrix, which is the same as the above mentioned species of 

 Bloch and of Lacepede. 



No additional information was communicated respecting this species until 

 the year 1S37. At that time, M. de Valenciennes, in his monograph of the 

 Gobioids contained in the twelfth volume of the " Histoire Naturelle des Pois- 

 sons," revised the characters of the genus Eleotris, and in addition to those 

 by which Cuvier distinguished it, referred to the presence of teeth only on the 

 jaws. From the genus, as thus constituted, he has separated the Platycepha- 

 lus dormitator of Schneider, or the Eleotris dormitatrix of Cuvier, 

 on account of the presence of teeth on the front of the vomer. Valenciennes 

 has taken the species as the type of a new genus, which he has called Philyp- 

 nus, and the presence of vomerine teeth is the only character by which he 

 distinguishes it from his Eleotris; he has called the species Philypnus dor- 

 mitator, and has given an extended description of it. He had examined 

 specimens from the islands of Martinique and Porto Rico, and has signalized its 

 presence in Saint Domingo. The species thus described is the only one which 

 he has referred to the genus. 



But in the same volume as that in which he has introduced the genus Phi- 

 lypnus, Valenciennes has placed in the genus Gobius, a Chinese fish which 

 Lacepede has described under the name of Bostryche chinois. This fish, 

 ^as will afterwards be shown, is nearly allied to the species of the genus Phi- 

 ypnus. 



II. The Bostryche chinois or Bostrychus sinensis, was first intro- 

 duced into Systematic Nomenclature by Lacepede, who founded the species 

 only on a Chinese drawing. The genus Bostrychus was formed for its recep- 

 tion, and was characterized by its "elongated and serpentiform body, two 

 dorsal fins, the second of which is separated from the caudal fin, two barbels 

 at the upper jaw, and the eyes quite large and without a lid." As a second 

 species of the genus so defined, Lacepede has placed a species which was 

 ascertained by Valenciennes to be a species of Ophicephalus, a genus belonging 

 to an entirely different family from the Bostrychus sinensis, and which 

 possesses a single long continuous dorsal. Notwithstanding this rather im- 

 portant variation from Bostrychus sinensis, Lacepede chiefly distinguishes 

 his second species by a difference of color, the former being described as brown, 

 and the latter as spotted with green ; from the latter character the name of 

 R. maculatus was conferred on it. The B. maculatus, like the B. 

 sinensis, was only known from a Chinese drawing. As Valenciennes has 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



already remarked, it should properly have been referred by Lacepede to his 

 genus Bostry choides, which was distinguished from his Bostrychus by the pre- 

 sence of only one dorsal fin. 



In 180(5, M. Dumeril published his " Zoologie Analytique, ou Methode 

 Naturelle de Classification des Animaux." In the ichthyological portion of 

 the volume, the genera of Lacepede are adopted, but the name of Bostrychusis 

 abolished on account of its previous application by Geoffrey to a genus of 

 coleopterous insects, and that of Bostrichtes or Bostrichthys is substituted in its 

 stead. The characters given to the genus are the same as those of Lacepede. 



In 1815, Rafinesque published his " Analyse de la Nature, ou Tableau de 

 l'Univers." In this volume there is first introduced into the seventh family 

 of the system {Petalomia,) and into the first sub-family (Cepolidia) the Bos- 

 trychus of Lacepede under the name of Bostrictis, and the Bostrychoides under 

 the name of Pterops, and these are interposed between Cepola and Trachypte- 

 rus on the one hand, and on the other Tasica Raf., and Lepodopus, while Gym- 

 netrus and a number of genera founded on more or less perfect specimens of 

 Trachypterus are placed in a second family called Gymnetria. Again the Bos- 

 trijchi and Bostrychoides are introduced under the new name of Ictiopogon for 

 Bostrychus, and Pterops for Bostrychoides into a twenty-third family called Pan- 

 topteria, and into a third sub-family (Anguillinia). The family and sub- families 

 contain a singular and most unnatural reunion of the most widely distinct 

 types ; apodal Scombroids and Xiphioids are mingled with apodal Blennoids 

 and Comephorus and Mastacembelus Gron, Ammodyles L., Ophidium L., and An- 

 guilla are thrown together in the same family. Rafinesque doubtless derived 

 the idea of placing the last named genera in the family of "Pantopteria " ot 

 apodal fishes from a remark of Lacepede, who saw no ventrals represented 

 in the figures of his Bostrychi, and therefore suggested that none might exist. 



Thus, on the authority of the figure of a Chinese painter, unacquainted with 

 Ichthyology, three distinct generic names, besides orthographical modifications 

 of two of them, had been formed for a fish which no naturalist had ever seen. 

 "Without criticism and without judgment, it had been referred to the systems 

 of the various authors, and one of them had placed it in two distinct orders in 

 the same work. After the last of these works, the problematical genus was 

 allowed to rest, and no naturalist has since paid attention to it. 



The first critical ichthyologist who examined the grounds on which the 

 species was founded, was M. Valenciennes. That excellent naturalist, like 

 his predecessors, only knew the species by the Chinese painting. Judging 

 from this alone, he recognized its affinity to the Gobioids, and expressed the 

 belief, from its form, that it was certainly a Gobius, and therefore called it 

 Gobius sinensis, but was careful to observe that he could neither see the 

 ventral fins, nor count the rays of the others. 



The first ichthyologist by whom the species was seen and described from 

 nature was Sir John Richardson. That gentlemen, in the Ichthyology of the 

 Voyage of H. M. S. the Sulphur, gave a description of it, referring it, as a new 

 species, to the genus Philypnus, under the name of P. ocellicauda. He after- 

 wards, in the same work, published his belief of its identity with the Bostry- 

 chus sinensis of Lacepede, and adopting the specific name of that author, 

 called it Philypnus sinensis. In the same part, he has given a very good 

 figure of the species. 



Subsequently, Dr. Bleeker, in his monograph of the Gobioids and Blennoids 

 of the Sundamulluccan Archipelago, described a fish, which he called Philyp- 

 nus ophicephalus, at the same time doubtfully placing as a synonyme, 

 the Philypnus ocellicauda of Richardson. He afterwards appeared to have 

 become satisfied of the identity of the two species, and adopting the older name 

 of Richardson, quoted his own as a synonyme. 



Although this sj)ecies is nearly allied to the true Phi lypni, it differs too much 

 from those species to be a natural member of the same genus. It has therefore 



I860.] 




122 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



been now placed in a separate one, for which, the name of Bostrichthys is 

 retained. The two genera, Philypnus and Bostrichthys, form a distinct group, 

 characterized chiefly by the presence of vomerine teeth. To this group, the 

 name of Philypni may be given : ultimately it may be found to be a separate 

 sub-family. 



Philypni Gill. 



The form of the body is similar to that of the typical Eleotroids, anteriorly 

 subcylindrical, becoming compressed, and slightly decreasing in height towards 

 the caudal fin. 



The head is elongated and depressed above, the mouth ample, the teeth 

 villiform on both the jaws and the front of the vomer. 



The branchial apertures are more or less extended forwards, but separated 

 from each other by an isthmus. 



There are sis branchiostegal rays, the four exterior of which are well devel- 

 oped, curved and compressed, the two internal are small and slender. 



The dorsal fins are separated by a considerable interval ; the ventrals ap- 

 proximated, but entirely disconnected. 



The above characters apply to the only two known genera. Subsequent 

 discoveries may necessitate their revision. The group as thus constituted, 

 differs from the Eleotroids by the presence of vomerine teeth, and the distance 

 of the dorsal fins from each other. If these characters are persistent, it would 

 seem proper to retain the group as a distinct sub-family. 



The only known genera are Philypnus Val., and Bostrichthys. Philypnus is 

 an American form, and Bostrichthys an Asiatic form. The characters of these 

 will be now given :

Head elongated, subconical in profile, depressed above ; mouth large, lower 

 jaw projecting beyond the upper; nostrils with raised margins, between the 

 eyes and upper jaw ; the distance between each nearly equal to that of the 

 anterior nostrils from the upper jaw, and of the posterior from the eyes. 

 Branchial apertures extending anteriorly nearly to the angles of the mouth 

 and separated from each other by a very narrow isthmus. Scales ctenoid, 

 moderate, extending on the forehead, opercula and cheeks ; pectinations of 

 those on the forehead and cheeks frequently obsolete. 



All of the scales on the body of the species of Philypnus are more or less 

 angulated posteriorly, and have the nucleus near the angle ; from this angle 

 radiating grooves and ridges diverge towards the anterior margin of the scales, 

 and are crossed by concentric strise, which terminate at the posterior borders in 

 pectinations that are often obsolete ; in other scales, especially on the fore- 

 head, the concentric striae surround a subcentral nucleus, and give to the 

 scales a pseudocycloid appearance. In young individuals the scales are much 

 more distinctly pectinated than in the adnlt.

This species has been very fully described by Valenciennes. He had ex- 

 amined specimens from Porto Rico, St. Domingo and Martinique. It has also 

 been found at Mexico. 



Dr. Girard has given a figure of a very small species of this genus under the 

 name of Philypnus dormitator. It is very probable the young of that 

 species, but as the only specimen in the Museum is one of fifteen inches in 

 length, obtained by the author at the junction of the Arouca and Caroni rivers, 

 in the island of Trinidad, there is no means of comparison. The specimen 

 described by Dr. Girard has very large eyes, and other characters of an ex- 

 tremely young fish. It was obtained at the mouth of the Rio Grande by Mr. 

 John H. Clarke, the Naturalist of the " United States and Mexican Boundary 

 Survey," and is preserved in the Smithsonian Museum. 



Philypnus lateralis Gill. 



In general outline of form, this species has considerable resemblance to the 

 Philypnus dormitator. The dorsal outline ascends in almost a straight 

 line from the snout to the front of the dorsal fin, the chief variation existing 

 between the eyes, where there is a slight depression. The back under the 

 first dorsal is straight ; at the second, it declines very little and in almost a 

 straight line to the base of the caudal fin. The abdominal outline from the 

 ventrals to the caudal fin converges in nearly the same proportion as the dor- 

 sal. The greatest height of the body, at the first dorsal ray, is equal to about 

 one-fifth of the total length, inclusive of the head and caudal fin ; the least 

 height at the base of the caudal is half of the greatest. 



The head, in profile, is conical or elongated triangular ; it forms three-tenths 

 of the total length. Its dorsal and inferior surfaces regularly converge towards 

 the tip of the lower jaw, and the declension of the former is about twice as 

 great as the ascension of the latter. The dorsal surface over the operculum 

 is rounded, and the degree of convexity becomes less towards the eyes, be- 

 tween which it is flat. The breadth at the operculum equals about half the 

 length of the head, and under the eyes it is between one-fourth and one-fifth 

 less. The interocular space is somewhat less than half of the breadth at the 

 opercula. The outlines of the jaws are semi-elliptical. 



The eyes are longitudinally oval, and are at the third sixth of the head's 

 length. 



The preoperculum in its declination recedes considerably backwards, and 

 is thence broadly curved forwards. The distance from the orbit to the pre- 

 opercular angle, equals the distance from the posterior border of the orbit to 

 its horizon behind the intermaxillaries. The operculum declines obliquely 

 downwards from its membranous point, and its greatest length, in an oblique 

 direction, slightly surpasses the interval between the orbit and the angle of 

 the preoperculum. The oculo-humeral groove is shallow and scarcely ascend- 

 ing. 



The mouth is oblique and large, the maxillaries extending backwards to 

 the vertical of the eyes. 



The teeth on the jaws do not much differ from those of the Philypnus dor- 

 mitator. The vomerine patch is narrowed towards its ends, and its teeth 

 are much smaller than those of the jaws, especially anteriorly. 



The scales on the sides of the body are of an oblong form and hexagonal 

 outline, with the nucleus at the posterior angle and with about eight radiating

ridges, some of which are bifurcate ; the ridges are separated into two portions 

 by the median line. The free margin is delicately pectinated. The scales are 

 of moderate size, there being about fifty-four in a row behind the pectoral fins. 

 Before the dorsal fin, and especially on the forehead, the nucleus is subcentral, 

 and with numerous radiating grooves sometimes advancing even to the lateral 

 margins. On the operculum they are often higher than wide, with the nu- 

 cleus subterminal to subcentral, with the posterior margin angulated and pec- 

 tiniform ; on the preoperculum they are smaller and almost square, with more 

 or less subcentral nuclei, and with the pectinations generally obsolete. 



The first dorsal fin commences some distance behind the vertical of the bases 

 of the pectorals, and has the arrangement of the rays normal in the Gobin^ 

 and Eleotrina?. The rays in length have the following relation to each 

 other; 2, 3, 1, 4. The second dorsal is oblong and commences behind the ver- 

 tical of the anus. 



The caudal fin is posteriorly rounded, and its longest rays form a fifth of the 

 length of the fish. 



The pectorals are rounded and equal in length to the interval between the 

 orbit and the margin of the operculum. The ventrals are also rounded, and 

 the third and fourth branched rays are the longest. 



The radial formula is as follows : 

 1 1 



D vi I, 8 ; A I, 1, 8 ; C 5, 6, 5, 5 ; P 2, 13 ; V I, 5. 

 1 1 



The color is dark purplish brown, lighter on the abdomen. Along the sides 

 a black band runs from behind the upper part of the pectoral to the base of 

 the caudal fin, dividing about nine vertical light bands, which project a little 

 above and below the band. At the base of the caudal, the lateral band some- 

 what enlarges, and is sometimes partly surrounded by a light margin. The 

 vertical and ventral fins are sometimes immaculate, but generally spotted 

 with white and black. The pectorals have a black spot at the upper axilla, 

 and a blackish basal band, bordered on each side by whitish. The head is 

 of the color of the back, with vertical dark bar from the eye to the angle of 

 the jaw, another from the inferior corner of the eye to the extremity of the 

 operculum, and another horizontal one from the orbit to the upper jaw. 



This species was obtained in considerable numbers by Mr. John Xantus, of 

 the United States Coast Survey, at Cape St. Lucas, Lower California. It adds 

 another proof of the similarity of the Fauna of the Gulf of California to that of 

 the West Indies. 



The specimens collected by Mr. Xantus are in the Museum of the Smith- 

 sonian Institution, and are numbered in the catalogue of the Ichthyological 

 collection from number 2435 to 2442. 



This species differs from its West Indian congener chiefly in its proportions, 

 the smaller vomerine band of teeth and in color.

laries ; the posterior subtubular and immediately in front of the antero- 

 superior border of the eye. Branchial apertures extending forwards consider- 

 ably beyond the posterior margins of the preopercles, and separated from each 

 other by a wide isthmus. Scales cycloid, small, especially anteriorly, and 

 extending on the opercula, cheeks and forehead. 



The name of Bostrychus, which was applied to this genus by Lacepede, had 

 been previously used by Geoffrey, who, in the year 1764, applied the name, 

 incorrectly spelled Bostrichus, to a genus of coleopterous insects. The name 

 applied to that group has been universally adopted by Entomologists, and the 

 name of Bostrychus, as applied to the piscine genus, must be replaced by 

 another. The name of Bostrichthys was proposed as a substitute by Mr. Du- 

 meril, and this is accepted. 



It would be questionable to some whether a genus founded on the evidence 

 that Bostrychus was by Lacepede, and founded, at the same time, on errone- 

 ous ideas, should be adopted. Bleeker has adopted Richardson's first specific 

 name, and on the same principle, the generic name of Lacepede would also 

 have been probably ignored by him. The same objections that exist against 

 Lacepede's name would, of course, militate against the adoption of those of 

 Dumeril and Rafinesque, which were only intended by their authors to super- 

 sede his. Believing, however, that the laws of priority are imperative, and 

 require the adoption of the first given name, when the object to which it was 

 given can be identified, and unless entirely founded on false characters, the 

 name of Bostrichthys is now accepted. Against the name, however, there exist 

 the objections of an erroneous formation, and of a reference to a false charac- 

 ter. The name, in accordance with the composition, should be written Bos- 

 trychichthys, but the erroneous name is more euphonius than the correct one. 

 The name itself would imply the presence of cirrhi or barbels, but none exist ; 

 the objects that were taken for such by Lacepede are the prolonged nasal 

 tubes. These objections do not appear to be of sufficient weight to authorize 

 a change of name. 



The zoological characters by which Bostrichthys is distinguished from Philyp- 

 nus are found chiefly in the difference of the extent of the branchial apertures, 

 the cycloid structure of the scales, the distant nasal apertures, and the tubu- 

 lar form of the anterior ones. The smaller size of the scales, especially on the 

 anterior portion of the back, where they are imbedded in the skin, perhaps 

 offers another distinguishing character of Bostrichthys.

 linquished for the prior one of Lacepede.

 also figured by the former, no further description is necessary, this being the

Notice of Geological Discoveries, made by Capt. J. H. Simpson, Topographical 

 Engineers, V. S. Army, in his recent Explorations across the Continent. 



Washington City, Aprildth, 1860. 

 Anticipatory of discoveries of a geological character which might be made 

 and published of date subsequent to those of my Explorations, in 1858 and '59, 

 across the Continent, with the sanction of the Hon. John B. Floyd, Secretary of 

 War, under whose authority the Explorations were made, I present in advance 

 of my final and detailed official report, the following communication from 

 Messrs. F. B. Meek and H. Engelmann, in reference to the fossil remains which 

 they found, and the geological epochs to which they point. As a large portion 

 relates to a region of country, The Great Basin, so called by Fremont lying 

 between the Wahsatch range of mountains on its east, and the Sierra Nevada on 

 its west, which never before was traversed by a white man, not even by a 

 trapper, so far as is known, the publication of this paper cannot be unacceptable 

 to the scientific world, and I therefore take pleasure in submitting it to be read 

 before the Academy.

 Capt. Top. Engineers, U. S. Army. 



Smithsonian Institution, ) 

 Washington, D. C, April 2d, 1860. ) 

 Capt. J. H. SimpsoD, Topographical Engineers, U. S. Army : 



Dear Sir, In accordance with your instructions we give below a brief state- 

 ment of some of the conclusions arrived at from a hasty examination of the 

 fossils collected during your late explorations in Utah. Although the time 

 yet devoted to the study of these specimens is not sufficient to enable us to 

 enter into details, enough has been determined to warrant the conclusion that 

 they are of considerable interest, and establish the existence there of geological 

 formations not hitherto known at such remote western localities. 



As a more extended sketch of the general geology of the country, including a 

 full account of the igneous and metamorphic rocks, together with figures and 

 descriptions of the new organic remains, are to appear in your final report, it is 

 unnecessary for us to do more here than to give merely some of the leading 

 facts determined from the fossils collected from the various formations exposed 

 along the line of survey. In doing this it will be most convenient to speak of 

 the formations in the order of their succession in point of time, beginning with 

 the most ancient, instead of referring to them in the order in which they were 

 observed in traversing the country. 



Devonian Rocks. 



The oldest deposits from which fossils in a condition to be determined were 

 collected, occur in the vicinity of the Humboldt Mountains, at the follow- 

 ing points, viz.: Long. 11445 / west, Lat. 39 45' north, Long. 115 58' west, 

 Lat. 39 33' north, and Long. 115 36' west, Lat. 39" 30' north. At the first 

 of these, localities fragments of Trilobites belonging as near as can be deter- 

 mined to the genera Calymene, Homalonotus and Proctus, were collected from a 

 hard, bluish limestone. The specimens are too imperfect to warrant a posi-

NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 127 



tive opinion whether they are Upper Silurian or Devonian forms, though 

 they evidently belong to one or the other of these epochs, and closely resem- 

 ble Hamilton Group forms. 



At the other localities mentioned above, a group of fossils of decided Devo- 

 nian type were found. They consist of Atrypa reticularis, A. aspera, or a 

 closely allied species, a small Productus, and three new species of Spirifer. The 

 first of these species has so great a vertical range, that taken alone, it would 

 only indicate that the rock from which it was obtained holds a position some- 

 where between the Upper Silurian and the middle or higher portions of the 

 Devonian. A. aspera is a common Devonian fossil, but is also said to occur in 

 the upper Silurian of the old world while the genus Productus is now generally 

 regarded as not dating farther back than the Devonian.* These facts taken in 

 connection with the close analogy of the small Productus mentioned above, and 

 the associated Spirifers, to forms characterizing the Hamilton Group of the New 

 York Devonian series, leave little room to doubt that the rock in which these 

 fossils were found is of Devonian age, and that it most probably belongs to about 

 the horizon of the Hamilton Group. 



The discovery of these fossils at this distant locality cannot fail to be 

 regarded as an interesting addition to our knowledge of the geology of the 

 great West, especially when it is borne in mind that they were obtained near 

 twelve hundred miles farther westward than such forms, so far as is known to 

 us, have hitherto been found in situ, within the limits of the territory of the 

 United States. f 



Carboniferous Rocks. 



Following up the sequence of the formations, we pass eastward to the vicin- 

 ity of Camp Floyd, which is in Long. 112 8' west, Lat. 40 13' north. Here 

 on the west side of Lake Utah, extensive deposits of a dark, very hard, silicious 

 limestone of Carboniferous age occur. The fossils collected from these beds 

 here, and for a long distance west of this, are in so bad a state of preservation 

 that the specific characters of most of them are much obscured. It is believed 

 however, that we have from this rock Orthis Michelini, and 0. umbraculum, 

 though they may be only allied representative species. There are also along 

 with these a species of Arthyris or Terebratula, one or two of Spirifer. and the 

 spiral axis of an Archimedes,^ with fragments of other Polyzoa and Corals. 

 As the genus, or subgenus Archimedes, has not j r et, so far as we know, been found 

 as high in the Carboniferous system as the Coal Measures, and there are ap- 

 parently no decided Coal Measure forms in the collections from this rock, we 

 are inclined to regard it as belonging to the Lower Carboniferous series. 



Carboniferous formations also extend westward from Camp Floyd to the 



* Some two or three species were formerly supposed to occur in the Upper Silurian 

 rocks of the Old World, but the correctness of this conclusion is questioned by most of 

 the best English and Continental auihorities. 



tA few fossils belonging to the genera Spirifer, Conocardium, &c, collected on a 

 former expedition by one of the writers (H. L\) near Medicine Bow Butte, Long. 106 30' 

 west, Lat. 41 38' north, were regarded by Dr. Shumard as probably of Devonian age, 

 though none of the species were positively identified with Devonian forms, and they 

 were obtained from an erratic mass, the exact original position of which is unknown. 



It is also stated in Capt. Stansbury's report that at a locality three or four days' march 

 eyond Fort Laramie, an outcrop from which some imperfect specimens of gasteropoda 

 and a shell resembling a Monotis were obtained, is probably of Devonian age. The expo- 

 sure here alluded to, however, is now known to be composed of Jurassic and proba- 

 bly Triassic rocks. The genus Monotis is unknown below the upper Coal Measures, in 

 this country, and the Permian in the Old World, though it ranges above on both sides of 

 the Atlantic. 



tWe believe this to be the first specimen of this curious fossil yet found in the region of 

 the Rocky Mountains.

128 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Devonian localities alluded to above, interrupted at places by outbursts of ig- 

 neous rocks. It is likewise probable there may be in this interval both Devo- 

 nian and Silurian strata, but the collections yet obtained are not sufficient to 

 enable us to speak with confidence on this point. 



Between Long. 115 and 115 30', Lat. 40 10' and Lat. 39 20', there is a se- 

 ries of hills or mountains, trending nearly north and south, to unknown distances 

 beyond the field of these explorations, which seem to be mainly made up of 

 lio-ht yellowish gray, more or less argillaceous, and arenaceous subcrystalline 

 limestones, and slates. This formation belongs to the Carboniferous system, 

 but is more recent than the dark colored limestone at Camp Floyd. The 

 fossils collected from it are for the most part new, and consist of three species 

 of Productus, one of which resembles P. Rogersi, Norwood and Pratten, two 

 new species of Spirifer, and another apparently identical with S. cameratus, but 

 more robust, and having stronger costae than is common in that species. Along 

 with these there are also specimens of Athyris sublilita, and a new species of 

 Chonetes, closely allied to C. Verneuiliana, Norwood and Pratten, from the Western 

 Coal Measures. From the affinities of this group of fossils, we have little hesita- 

 tion in referring this rock to the Upper Carboniferous series, though in its 

 lithological characters it is entirely unlike strata of that age in the Middle and 

 Western States. 



There were also seen at a few places near here, some outcrops of dark grayish 

 colored limestones, containing Productus, Spirifer, &c. These were not ob- 

 served in contact with the light colored beds mentioned above, but under 

 circumstances indicating that they hold a lower position, from which it is 

 inferred they are probably of lower carboniferous age. 



The occurrence here, as far west as Long. 115, of extensive Carboniferous 

 formations, is another interesting fact in the geology of this distant region not 

 known previous to these explorations, no rocks of this age being represented 

 on any of the most recent and carefully compiled geological maps, from near 

 Camp Floyd and the Salt Lake to the Pacific Ocean. 



Deposits, probably of the age of the Coal Measures and of great thickness, 

 were also observed in the Wahsatch Mountains east of Lake Utah, along Tim- 

 panogns Canon. The strata here, however, consist mainly of dark colored and 

 bluish impure limestones, slates, and argillaceous shales, the latter containing 

 at a few places fragments of carbonaceous matter, the whole being upheaved 

 and greatly distorted, apparently by violent forces acting from beneath. The 

 fossils collected from these beds all differ specifically from those found in the 

 light colored limestone at the localities near Long. 115 west, and we have no 

 means of determining which of these is the older rock. The specimens from 

 the dark colored beds in the Caiion, consist of one new or undetermined Spirifer, 

 two of Productus, and two of Athyris, together with fragments of a small 

 Lepidodendron. 



The indications of Coal of true Carboniferous date, seem to be more favorable 

 here than at any other point examined along the route explored, though no beds 

 of it were seen. Good coal has, however, been found in the same mountain 

 range 140 miles south of this, but as yet little is positively known in regard to 

 its age. 



Several miles above this on Timpanogos River, and at a higher geological 

 horizoD, outcrops of light colored, and yellowish sandstones and silicious lime- 

 stones, with red shales, were seen. At one place in this formation a few speci- 

 mens of very hard, light gray, highly silicious rock were obtained, containing 

 great numbers of small bivalves, in a broken condition. As, near as could be 

 determined these are very much like Bakevellias, while another of these speci- 

 mens contains a fragment resembling closely a Phyllipora. Both these fossils 

 are quite similar to Permian forms, but it would be unsafe without other evi- 

 dence to refer the rock to that epoch. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 129 



Triassic Rocks. 



At several localities east of Lake Utah, near the tributaries of Uintah River, 

 extensive deposits of fine red, more or less arenaceous material were seen oc- 

 cupying considerable areas, and from the accounts of various explorers, this 

 formation is greatly developed along the Wahsatch Mountains south of Lake 

 Utah. At these latter localities we have accounts of numerous beds of gypsum, 

 and deposits of rock salt. These beds where seen near Uintah River are not 

 known to contain gypsum or salt, but from the occurrence of gypsum in similar 

 formations a little farther south, and their proximity and relations to Jurassic 

 strata to be mentioned hereafter, there is little room for doubting that they 

 are the same red gypsum-bearing deposit seen by Dr. Hayden beneath Jurassic 

 rocks at the Black Hills. (See paper by Meek & Hayden, Proceed. Acad. Nat. 

 Sci., Phil'a, March, 1858, p. 44.) 



From the statement of Mr. Marcon, Dr. George Shumard, Mr. Blake, and 

 more recently of Dr. J. S. Newberry, it is evident this formation is developed on 

 a grand scale in New Mexico. The only organic remains yet found in it, so far 

 as we know, were some plants (Zamites, Pterophyllum, c.) and Saurian bones, 

 discovered by Dr. Newberry during his important investigations in the South- 

 West, as geologist of the exploring expeditions under the command of Lieut. 

 Ives, in 1858, and Capt. M'Comb, Top. Engrs., U. S. Army, in 1859. These 

 fossils led Dr. N. to refer this series to the New Red or Triassic epoch,* which 

 view was also maintained by Mr. Marcon, though the latter gentleman seems 

 not to have had a very clear idea of its limits, since he included other rocks 

 in the Trias as defined by him. 



This formation is well exposed on the North Platte at Red Butte, above Fort 

 Laramie, where it also contains several beds of gypsum, and again on La- 

 Bonte Creek, nearer Fort Laramie. It likewise occurs on Smoky Hill River, 

 and at other localities in Kansas, where it has been referred (along with some 

 lower Cretaceous rocks, and possibly some Jurassic strata) to the Trias, by Mr. 

 F. Hawn. All the facts that have been accumulating for some time past, seem 

 to render it more than probable that this series really represents the Trias of 

 the Old World. 



Jurassic Rocks. 



At the localities already mentioned where the red beds were seen near 

 Duchesne River, a tributary of Uintah River, heavy deposits were also observed 

 of grayish and whitish calcareous rock, and light, red and whitish sandstones 

 and shales. Some portions of the same formation were also met with further 

 to the north-west on the east branch of Weber River. At both of these places 

 in the calcareous beds, fragments of Peclen, Ostrea and portions of the columns of 

 Pentacrinus, undistinguishable from those of the Jurassic species P. asteriscus, 

 Meek and Hayden, were found. From the presence of these fossils, taken together 

 with all the other circumstances, we have scarcely room to doubt that these 

 deposits are of Jurassic age. 



Well marked Jurassic strata occur at Red Buttes, on the North Platte, at 

 the same locality already referred to in speaking of the red gypsum bearing 

 rocks. They were not seen in direct contact with the gypsum formations, but 

 under circumstances showing that they must hold a higher stratigraphical 

 position. Here they consist of sandstones, shales and slates, more or less lam- 

 inated calcareous sandstones, and gritty limestones of various colors, altogether 

 of considerable thickness. Some of the lower of these beds are quite fossilifer- 

 ous. The specimens collected consist of Pentacrinus asteriscus, Meek and Hayden, 

 a Gryphaa probably identical with G. calceola, Quenstredt, a plicated oyster. 



*See Am. Journ., vol. 28, 2d ser., p. 299:

130 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



closely allied to 0. Marshii,* a Pecten scarcely distinguishable from P. lens of 

 Sowerby, a small Dentalium, and Belemnites densus, Meek and Hayden. From 

 the identity of some of these species with forms collected by Dr. Hayden at the 

 Black Hills, from beds overlying the red gypsum bearing strata of that region, 

 and associated with other well marked Jurassic types, as well as from the 

 affinities of the new species discovered at the locality under consideration on 

 the North Platte, we have no hesitation in referring these deposits to the 

 Jurassic system, in accordance with the views of Dr. Hayden and one of the 

 writers (F. B. M.) expressed in regard to the beds alluded to at the Black Hills. 

 (See Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci., Philad'a, March, 1858.) 



Cretaceous Rocks. 



Returning south-westward again to Weber river, in order to follow up the 

 succession of the formations, we find that at a point nearly due east of Salt 

 Lake City, on that stream, and but a short distance north of the locality, where 

 it has already been mentioned that Jurassic bed3 with Pentacrinus occur, out- 

 crops of a Whitish Sandstone were seen, containing in an imperfect condition 

 an Oyster, agreeing in all respects, as far as could be determined, with 0. 

 glabra of Meek and Hayden. This rock, with the same oyster, was also seen 

 some eight or nine miles farther down Weber River; also, on White Clay Creek, 

 a tributary of Weber River, and some fifty miles farther east on Sulphur Creek, 

 a tributary of Bear River. At the latter locality a small Anomia was also 

 found with the same Oyster ; and in a more yellowish portion of the same for- 

 mation several specimens of Inoceramus, closely allied to the Western species 

 usually referred to /. problematicus. Judging from the Oyster occurring in 

 this rock, and from its lithological characters, it would seem to be of 

 the same age as some older Cretaceous strata, at the mouth of Judith River, on 

 the Upper Missouri, which have been referred by Dr. Hayden and one of the 

 writers ; provisionally to No. 1, of the Nebraska section. 



At several of the localities rather extensive beds of excellent brown coal, 

 with some shale, were seen in immediate contact with this Oyster Sandstone, 

 and apparently dipping at the same angle, so as to give the impression, when 

 examined, that it belongs to the same epoch. 



Well marked Cretaceous rocks were seen at a point on the Platte below 

 the Red Buttes, near the Platte Bridge. The beds consist of gray shales and 

 slates. The fossils found here are a large new species of Inoceramus, a 

 fragment of a much compressed Baculite and Ostrea congexta of Conrad. From 

 the presence of the latter fossil, it is more than prabable these beds are on a 

 parallel with No. 2 or 3 of the Nebraska Cretaceous series. 



Tertiary Rocks. 



Tertiary formations occur over a large area in the region of Fort Bridger. 

 They seem to belong to two distinct epochs, the older of which was seen on 

 Bear River, near the mouth of Sulphur Creek, about 30 miles west of Fort 

 Bridger, and but a short distance from the locality, already mentioned, where 

 the Oyster and Inoceramus occur in a yellow sandstone. The outcrop seen 

 here consists of light colored and gray argillaceous shale, with coarse dark and 

 light colored limestones, all of which dip at a high angle. The fossils collected 

 from these beds consist of one new species of Unio, three of Corbula (Potarno- 

 i.iya), three species of Melanin, three or four of Paludina, and one of Melampus. 



This is an exceedingly interesting deposit, which is undoubtedly of brackish- 

 water origin, the fossils belonging to just such a group of genera as we would 

 expect to find in an estuary deposit, without any strictly marine forms. One

of the species of Melania appears to be identical with Cerithium tenerum of Hall, 

 (Fremont's Report, pi. 3, fig. 6,) and a small Paludina agrees very closely with 

 Natica? accidentalk, while a third is equally as near Turbo paludinceformis, of the 

 same report. All the other species are new excepting one Paludina, which is 

 identical with P. Conradl of Meek and Hayden, from the estuary beds at the 

 mouth of Judith River, on the Upper Missouri. All the facts point to the con- 

 clusion that this formation holds a low position in the Tertiary System, or, in 

 other words, is probably of Eocene age. 



The succeeding more recent Tertiary beds of this region, are extensively 

 developed along the route traversed, from near the last mentioned locality to 

 Fort Bridger, and thence towards the South Pass. They differ materially in 

 their lithological character from the older deposits just described, and are 

 characterized by an entirely different group of fossils. The upper part of this 

 series consists of greenish sandstones and arenaceous shales, interstratified with 

 sandy and calcareous slates altogether estimated at from two to three hundred 

 feet in thickness, and apparently destitute of fossils. Then comes, (descending,) 

 light colored argillaceous and pure limestones, with at places great numbers of 

 fossils, all of which are strictly fresh water forms, belonging to a few species. 

 Those collected consist of two new species of Melania, two of Limnea, one of 

 Unio and two or three of Planorbls. There is also at the junction of the lower 

 light colored more calcareous deposits with those above, at many places, a 

 band of dark shaly, more or less carbonaceous material, containing many im- 

 pressions of fern and other leaves. 



As all the fossils found in the foregoing series are distinct from those yet 

 discovered in known horizons, in the other Tertiary basins of the North- West, 

 we have no means of drawing parallels, though they are probably miocene. 

 Whether the extensive lignite beds on Bitter Muddy Creeks, east and north of 

 Fort Bridger, belong to this series or to the horizon of the older Sulphur Creek 

 coal is unknown, these localities being too remote from the route to be examined. 



The more modern group described above was never seen in an upheaved or 

 inclined condition, like the estuary beds on Bear River, though it is manifest 

 that the general contour of the country has been considerably modified since its 

 deposition, as this formation was often seen occupying some of the most 

 elevated positions. , 



Beneath this series heavy deposits were observed at several places, consisting 

 of light and whitish fine grained sandstone in thick layers, interstratified with 

 bright red, areno-argillaceous shales. Although these beds appeared to be 

 conformable with the superimposed Tertiary, as no organic remains were found 

 in them, their age must be regarded as doubtful. 



From the foregoing remarks it will be seen that these collections furnish no 

 evidence of the existence of strictly marine Tertiary deposits in the Green River 

 Basin, but like all those yet obtained in Nebraska, point to the conclusion that 

 the Tertiary strata of this central portion of the Continent were deposited in 

 brackish and fresh waters. The oldest of these formations, so far as known, 

 contain a group of mollusca indicating brackish waters, while all the subsequent 

 formations are of strictly fresh water origin. 



Another fact worthy of note is, that all the secondary and Tertiary fossils 

 collected during the survey came from localities east of the Wahsatch range of 

 mountains, while all the specimens collected west of that range of mountains, 

 in the Great Basin, came from Palaeozoic rocks. 



In the ranges of mountains west of the 116th degree of longitude, to the 

 Sierra Nevada, near lat. 39, igneous rocks predominate, and only few traces of 

 stratified rock were found in that district, in none of which any organic remains 

 were observed.

132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Catalogue of Birds collected during a survey of a route for a ship Canal across, 

 the Isthmus of Darien, by order of the Government of the United States, 

 made by Lieut. N. Michler, of the U.S. Topographical Engineers, with notes 

 and descriptions of new species. 



BY JOHN CASSIN. 



The route surveyed by Lieut. Michler, for the purpose of ascertaining the 

 practicability of establishing communication by water, between the Atlantic 

 and Pacific Oceans, was mainly by way of the river Atrato and its tributaries, 

 the Truando and the Nercua. In the performance of this duty, the Atrato was 

 ascended for a distance of about ninety miles, to the mouth of the Truando, 

 and then a southwesterly route pursued along the latter towards the Pacific Ocean. 

 The Nercua is a tributary of the Truando at a distance of thirty-six miles from 

 the union of the latter with the Atrato. 



The most interesting localities mentioned in the present catalogue are on 

 those two rivers, especially after the Truando reaches the Cordilleras, in which 

 in a great measure it and the Nercua have their course. These localities have 

 been but very partially explored by naturalists. Another locality frequently 

 mentioned is Turbo, which is a small village on the Atlantic, directly on the 

 eastern side of the Gulf of Uraba or Darien, and nearly opposite to the mouths 

 or delta of the Atrato. 



This collection was made by Mr. William S. Wood, Jr. and Mr. Charles J. 

 Wood of Philadelphia, who accompanied the Expedition, and were of course 

 under the immediate direction of the chief officer of the Expedition, Lieut. N. 

 Michler, of the U. S. Topographical Engineers. This accomplished officer and 

 gentleman encouraged in the fullest degree investigations in Natural History 

 throughout the route, whenever consistent with other duties, and as opportu- 

 nity presented. To his enlightened views and evident appreciation of the in- 

 teresting character of the zoology of the country traversed by the Expedition, 

 science in America is indebted for the present valuable collection, including 

 several birds never before known, and other valuable additions to the zoology 

 of this continent.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



This is a remarkable and apparently new species of Monasa, strictly of the 

 same group, and related to M. Morphotus (==albifrons and personata) and M. pe- 

 ruana. Like those species, the present bird has a conspicuous white frontal 

 band, which reaches very nearly from one eye to the other, but it differs from 

 those species in being without any white whatever on the throat. It is, how- 

 ever, easily distinguished from all known species, by the cinereous color of the 

 body above and below and wing coverts ; which color is very light, and in some 

 specimens nearly white on the whole of the upper wing coverts, and but slightly 

 darker on the under wing coverts. Several specimens labelled as both sexes 

 are in the collection from the river Truando. 



Stated by Messrs. W. S. and C. J. Wood, to have been seen once only in the 

 Cordilleras on the river Truando, in January, 1858. A party of eight or ten 

 specimens was observed sitting very quietly in a tree at some distance from the 

 ground, and being quite regardless of the gun or the presence of man, several 

 were obtained. Specimens labelled as females are slightly larger than those 

 stated to be males.*

 It would require nice discrimination to determine with certainty the priority of either 

 of the above names. My impression is that M. Lafresnaye's name is entitled rather to 

 preference, because it bears an unmistakeabledate, which the other does not, but requires 

 to be determined by examination or approximation.

" Monasa peruana, Bp. et Verr." label on spec, from M. Verreaux. 



Monasa peruana, Sclater, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1855, p. 194. 

 This is very closely allied lo the now well known M. morphoeus, and scarcely dis- 

 tinguishable without specimens of both. A specimen bearing M. Verreaux's label is in 

 the Acad. Coll., and is therefore entirely reliable as this species.

Of this Woodpecker, I have found no description nor figure which seemed to 

 approach it, except Picus andatus of authors figured by Edwards, pi. 332. It is 

 nearly the size and of the same general colors as that species, but instead of 

 two patches of red on the cheeks as described and figured in P. undatus, the 

 present bird has a single large patch completely enclosing a space on the 

 throat around the base of the lower mandible, similar to that in the common 

 Picus varius of the United States. This character I cannot trace in any other 

 species of this genus. 



This bird belongs to the same subgeneric group as Celeus rufus, which seems 

 to have no name, though readily defined.

One specimen, labelled as a male, in the collection of the Expedition is dis-

tinct from any species in Acad. Coll. or that we find described, except as above. 

 It is nearly allied to 0. Montezumae of Mexico and Central America, and 0. 

 bifasciatus of Northern Brazil, both of which are in the Acad. Coll. and are 

 distinct from each other. 



The present bird differs from both of the above species in being larger, 

 darker colored and having a lengthened almost filiform crest. The bill also i3 

 disproportionately longer and wider at base, with a rounded termination in 

 front. It is not without scruples that I apply the name above to this bird ; the 

 description by the Prince Bonaparte, as cited, not being sufficient for the recog- 

 nition of any species nearly related to another.*

Hab. Cordilleras Mountains, on the Kiver Truando,New Granada. Discov- 

 ered by Mr. W. S. Wood, Jr., and Mr. C. J. Wood, attached to U. S. Expedition 

 for surveying the River Atrato, in command of Lieut. N. Michler, U. S. Topog. 

 Engineers. Spec, in Nat. Mus., Washington. 



This is a curious bird and has not a little puzzled the present writer. My 

 impression is that it is an undescribed genus related to Icteria and more so to 

 Orthogonys and not unlike some species of Pyranga. At present I rate it as an 

 Orlhogonys to which it quite as much belongs as Pyranga cyanictera of authors 

 at least, of which there are several specimens in the Academy collection. 



Mr. C. J. Wood states that this bird inhabits low trees and bushes in the 

 Cordilleras, on the Rio Truando, and could be constantly heard at some local- 

 ities, though not so easily seen. Its notes are loud and much varied, bearing a 

 general resemblance to those of the Chat of North America {Icteria viridis). It 

 appeared to be very active and lively, constantly flying about the bushes and 

 changing its position.

 were observed to always resort to one tree to roost, and constantly frequenting

Entire plumage light rufous, darker on the back, and lighter on the under

 shafts and inner webs of quills darker. Total length, about 9 inches, wing 5, 

 tail 4^ inches. Sexes alike. 



Several specimens labelled as both sexes, are from Turbo and the river 

 Truando, and all have the appearance of being in young or some peculiar 

 seasonal plumage. These specimens are all of an uniform dull rufous, very 

 nearly the color of the immature plumage in some species of black Tach.yph.onus 

 which induces me to suppose that the adult of this bird is quite different in 

 color from the present specimens. Although undoubtedly of the genus 

 Lipaugus, this bird corresponds but indifferently with the last description 

 above cited, though it may be that species in the plumage of another season 

 than that described. 



"In the dry parts of the forest at Turbo, and in the Cordilleras on the Rio 

 Truando, in the lower trees. Frequently seen, but always solitary and silent.

Mr. Aubrey H. Smith read the following extracts from a letter from 

 Mr. Alex. H. Smith, of Solano Co., California, dated March 25th, 1860, 

 on the habits of the Beaver. 



"This winter I have had an opportunity of observing somewhat the habits of 

 the Beaver. You know that this cunning little animal is famed for bis industry 

 and bold engineering. About the middle of our land there is a large slough 

 seventy feet wide and very deep, running back into the country. In the pro- 

 gress of our work, it became necessary to stop it off and lay a large sluice to 

 drain it, which was done in a complete manner. 



At the head of the slough, two miles away, the beavers had their settlement. 

 When the water fell away from their houses and would not return, as usual, 

 they seemed to have sent a delegation down to see what was the matter. For 

 several successive mornings we found a dam built across the race leading to 

 the sluice, quite skilfully made with sticks and tuUs, and cemented with mud. 

 One of the men agreed to watch for them with the hope of securing their skins, 

 which are of some value. The night was bright moonlight. Four beaver? 

 came down examining either bank carefully. One of the party always remained 

 in the water and seemed to be the commander, and would turn from the one to 

 the other to see that each did his duty. At length they reached the dam, still 

 observing the same caution. The three examiners came out and went all over 

 it and into the sluice, chattering the while to their companion in the water. 

 Finally they seemed satisfied that it was past their skill and went off. Since 



[May,

then we have had no further trouble with them. When the man was ask?d 

 why he did not s,hoot, he said, ' he did'nt want to shoot the pretty little cree- 

 lers, he wanted to see what they were going to do.' I could not help being 

 pleased with his humanity and love of science." 



Mr. Lea mentioned that he had recently received a letter from Dr. Showalter 

 of Uniontown, Alabama, in which he mentions that specimens of Physa (yyrina) 

 Say, which he sent on, were obtained in an open neglected cistern, and in a 

 trough of water supplied by an Artesian well ten miles from the town. Dr. S. 

 expressed his surprise that these Physa should find their homes so soon at these 

 Artesian wells. There are no streams or pools near to these wells, but in a few 

 years after they are bored and water supplied, these shells may with certainly 

 be found. Mr. Lea went on to mention that he had nearly 30 years ago found 

 an undescribed species of Lymncea, accompained by Physa heterostropha Say, in 

 a small artificial pond on the high grounds near to the Falls of Schuylkill, 

 about four miles north of Market Street, now within the limits of this City. He 

 published an account of it in April 1834, in the Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. under 

 the name of acuta. The pond was small and dug out for lh to 2 feet deep, 

 simply for the supply of rain water for cattle. Afterwards it dried up and the 

 shells were no longer to be obtained there. He never found this Lyvmoea in, 

 any other habitat; but many years subsequently, Dr. Ingalls, of Greenwich, 

 N. Y., near to Lake Champlain, sent him several specimens of what he regard- 

 ed as a new Lymncea, but which was at once recognised as the acuta, heretofore 

 found only in the one habitat near the Falls of Schuylkill. In the minds of 

 some zoologists a difficulty exists as to existence of species in such constricted, 

 isolated points as mentioned above, but that difficulty in Mr. Lea's mind was 

 done away with under the belief that very young molluscs may be transported 

 on the feet of birds from distant points, or on those of cattle going to drink from 

 one place to another. The idea of spontaneous generation could not of course 

 be for one moment admitted. 



Mr. Lea also read an extract of a letter from Dr. Lewis, of Mohawk, 

 N. Y., giving an account of some meteorological phenomena, and exhibited 

 a diagram of thermal curves traced by the self-registering thermometer of Dr. 

 Lewis. 



Prof. R. E. Rogers stated that he had recently received a letter from Western 

 Pennsylvania, communicating the intelligence that some of the Petroleum wells 

 had already begun to show a diminished yield of Oil, a fact in confirmation of 

 an apprehension which lie had expressed at a former meeting of the Academy, 

 that when the Artesian borings became more numerous in the favorite localities, 

 there was a probability of such a result. 



He regarded the circumstance of even a small reduction in the supply of the 

 oil, from any of the wells, at this early stage of the enterprise in that region, 

 as very significant, and suggestive of the fear that, remunerative as these 

 wells may at present prove to be, it may not be prudent to base permanent 

 calculations upon them. 



In connection with the subject, Prof. Rogers described the approved process 

 by which the illuminating and lubricating Coal Oils are manufactured, an I 

 detailed the characteristics which seemed to be requisite to render any oil- 

 making material profitably available for the purpose.

148 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



May 15th. 

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 



Fifty-three members present. 



The following papers were presented for publication : 



" Description of a new species of Marginella," by John H. Redfield. 



" Descriptions of new organic remains from the Tertiary, Cretaceous 

 and Jurassic rocks of Nebraska," by F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden. 



And were referred to Committees. 



Dr. Fisher read the following extract of a letter from Mr. J. H. 

 Kedfield : 



' : Mr. J. R. Willis announces that he has discovered, in deep water off the 

 coast of Nova Scotia, small specimens of the Waldheimia cranium, hitherto known 

 only from Norther i Europe. He has also found Littorina litorea abundant upon 

 the rocky shore? near Halifax, the specimens being perfectly undistinguishable 

 from English examples." 



Prof. R. E. Rogers exhibited a modification of Mr. Gore's apparatus of the 

 metallic ball revolving in a circle under the influence of a galvanic current. 



The apparatus consists of two bands of sheet brass, secured parallel and 

 within an inch and a half of each other, upon the edge of a board, so as to 

 form a miniature railway, on which the ball may rest. 



To give automatic action to the ball, causing it to transverse the rails alter- 

 nately to and fro, the ends of the bands are bent slightly upwards. By this 

 arrangement, the ball, on approaching the end of its course in one direction, is 

 carried by its momentum a little up the inclination, but gravity soon prevail- 

 ing, its motion is reversed, and continues in its new direction until the same 

 result takes place at the other end. 



The death of Bernard Henry, M. D., who died at sea on the 15th 

 April, was announced. 



On motion of Mr. Vaux, the following resolution was unanimously 

 adopted : 



Resolved, That the thanks of this Society be presented to H. Gr. De- 

 silver, for the valuable addition to its collection of the fine specimen of 

 the Moose presented this evening.

Mr. Aubrey H. Smith remarked, that a few days since, whilst he and 

 another member of the Academy were crossing a sandy bank, partially covered 

 with low bushy pine trees and other undergrowth, near Moorestown, N. J., 

 they came across a black snake of about four feet in length, lying near the 

 edge of the cover formed by the bushes. At the first alarm, the animal, in- 

 stead of escaping along the ground, into the shelter so close at hand, immedi- 

 ately, with a rapid gliding motion, ascended among the branches of the pines, 

 and reaching their somewhat flattened tops, pressed along from one of them 

 to the other at the height of some six or seven feet from the ground, and 

 finally rested at length among the horizontal upper branches. The ascent was 

 made by him in a direction almost perpendicular, solely by projecting the body 

 upward from the ground to the lower branches of the trees, and from them as 

 from a new point of support, to those next higher, not deriving any aid 

 from the upright trunk of the tree, which he did not seem even to touch. 

 When again disturbed by our approach, he did not descend, but retreated with 

 the same gliding motion along the top of the pines. It was not till actually 

 seized by the hand, that, on his release, he betook himself to flight along the 

 ground. 



Mr. Lea called the attention of the members to two very remarkable speci- 

 mens of Echinus, perforating rocks, which he had recently received from Mr. 

 Cailliaud, of Nantes, the Egyptian traveller. He also exhibited a specimen of 

 Sandstone from Payta in Peru, which contained Pelricola, Lilhophagus, &c. He 

 reminded the members that he had presented to the Academy a very remarka- 

 ble specimen, which he had received about two years since from Mr. Cailliaud, 

 being a mass of gneiss which had been perforated by Pholades. When Mr. 

 Cailliaud, who had advocated, contrary to the opinion of most naturalists, the 

 theory that some of the Molluscs bored the rocks by friction and not by de- 

 composition, found that gneiss and granite and other silicious rocks were pene- 

 trated by them, he entirely settled that question, for there are no acids known 

 which will decompose silex. Mr. Lea remarked that the two specimens now 

 on the table were still more remarkable. The smaller one consisted of two 

 specimens of Echinus lividus, Lam., which had buried themselves in the solid 

 granite, one of them having made a circular hole lj inch deep, and 2 inches 

 wide. This specimen came from the granite coast of the Loire-Inferieure. 

 The second specimen consisted of quite a congress of individuals of the same 

 species, imbedded in a solid mass of hard Silurian Sandstone, from the Bay of 

 Douarnenez, in the Department of Finistere. In this be lutiful specimen there 

 are five individuals nestled in their circular holes, worked out in this hard stone 

 by the attrition of their teeth, and there are three holes vacated. The specimen 

 is 5 inches by 6J, and there being eight holes in all, their circumferences nearly 

 impinge on each other. Mr. Cailliaud is entirely satisfied that the boring is 

 purely mechanical, that the five teeth are the instruments of exploitation, and 

 that it is by the percussion of their points on the rocks that these holes are 

 effected. The teeth are in form like the rodents, and constantly increase as 

 worn at the outer extremity. He made a hole five millimetres deep and forty 

 in circumference with a bundle of the teeth in an hour. One of the colonies 

 which he examined was in a bay, and contained about two thousand holes, each 

 one filled, and at low water they were but a short distance below the surface. 

 Some of the specimens were not larger than a pea, and probably only five days 

 old. The holes were not all made by the present occupants, most of them pro- 

 bably being very old and having successive inhabitants. Mr. Cailliaud men- 

 tioned in his letter to Mr. Lea that he shortly expected to receive from Guada- 

 loupe an oval Echinus which had made its oval hole in the mass of Madreporite. 



Dr. I. I. Hayes stated to the Academy, that his success in New 

 York and Boston, in raising funds for his proposed Arctic Expedition, 

 1860."|

had been so great, that if he could succeed in raising $6000 in this 

 city he would be able to sail this year. 



May 29th. 

 Mr. Lea, President in the Chair. 



Thirty-eight members present. 



The report of the Biological Department was presented. 



The following resolution, presented by Dr. Leidy on behalf of the 

 Curators, was adopted, 



Resolved, That the Publication Committee and the Committee on 

 Proceedings, be authorized to exchange as much of the Journal and 

 Proceedings of the Academy as can be spared, for the suite of Palaeozoic 

 fossils, which have been offered by Mr. J. N. H. Barris. 



The following papers were, on the report of the Committees to whom 

 they had been referred, ordered to be published in the Proceedings. 



Notes on American Land Shells. No. 6, 

 BY W. G. BINNEY. 



The Catalogue of the Terrestrial Mollusks of North America, commenced in 

 the Proceedings of the Academy for November, 1858, and continued in the 

 number for July, 1859, is here completed. The list is believed to contain all 

 the species described as inhabiting Mexico. I have followed the systematic 

 arrangement of Drs. Gray and Pfeiffer in grouping the genera, and the de- 

 cisions of the latter in regard to the synonymy. 



Many Central American species will undoubtedly be added to the list when 

 their geographical range is better known. The species of the Pacific coast, 

 included in the first section of the Catalogue, are omitted here, viz.: Nos. 3, 

 7, 8, 11, 23, 25, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 47. 



For additional species, changes of nomenclature, &c, &c, of the section of 

 the United States, see Boston Journal of Natural History, vol. vii., and the 

 Remarks on North American Helicidse by Mr. T. Bland, in Annals of New 

 York Lyceum of Natural History, vol. vi.

Onchidium Carpenteri. Among the mollusca from the Straits of De Fuca, 

 Mr. Carpenter has detected five specimens of a shelless inollusk, which evi- 

 dently belong to the genus Onchidium. Being preserved in alcohol it is diffi- 

 cult to obtain any more satisfactory specific characters than the following : 

 The body is oblong, with its extremities circularly rounded ; the upper sur- 

 face is regularly arched ; below, quite near the edge, the border of the mantle 

 is readily distinguished, most of the under surface is occupied by the broad, 

 distinct, locomotive disk ; the body is uniformly smoke-colored ; in size the 

 individuals vary considerably, the length of the largest being 5, the extreme 

 breadth 3 millimetres.

Saturnia Schrank. 



S. g a lb in a. Antennae luteous. Body and head rather dark brown. 

 Fore wings yellowish-brown, with a rather faint whitish, angulated band at 

 the base. On the discal nervure is a round, black ocellus having a central 

 subvitreous streak, containing a yellow circle, and toward the base of the 

 wing a slender blue crescent. A whitish band crosses the middle of the ner- 

 yules, with a faint wavy one between it and the hind margin. In the apical 

 interspace is a black spot, with a crimson streak to the tip of the wing. The 

 marginal portion of the wing is whitish, and is tinged on the terminal edge 

 with pale yellowish brown. Hind wings similar in color and ornamentation 

 to the fore wings, the ocelli being somewhat smaller. On the under surface, 

 which is similar in hue to the upper, the faint wavy bands of the fore and 

 hind wings are very distinct. 



Texas. From the Smithsonian Institution. Capt. Pope's collection. 



Pimela. 



In the fore wings, the costal and subcostal nervures are placed near each 

 other and the exterior margin. The subcostal sends a single marginal branch 

 from near the posterior-superior angle of the disk, delivered to the margin 

 near the tip, and just behind this angle divides into two branches ; the upper 

 one or the apical is simple, and the lower one is subdivided into three ner- 

 vules, the post apical arising near the upper third and the infra post-apical and 

 subcosto-inferior near the middle. The discal nervure arises midway between 

 the origin of the subcosto-marginal branch and that of the apical ; it is acutely 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 157 



angulated about the middle and sends a false nervule through the disk to the 

 base of the wing, and above this arises the discal nervule. 



The median nervure is four-branched. In place of the fold is a slender, 

 simple nervure. The submedian sends two branches to the inner margin, one 

 from the upper third and one from the lower third of the nervure. (This may 

 be a malformation. However I can scarcely believe it is one.) 



Hind wings without costal nervure. The subcostal forms an imperfect cell 

 at its base, and near the hind end of the disk sends off an apical branch, which 

 gives rise to an oblique but not angulated discal nervure ; from this arises a 

 false nervule running to the base, and nearly opposite to it a discal nervule to 

 the hind margin. 



Median nervure four-branched. Submedian and internal, simple. 



Body stout and very pilose, woolly. Head rather small : eyes rather large 

 and salient. Antennae, basal joint somewhat tufted, rather longer than the 

 thorax, rather deeply pectinated with the branches decreasing in length to the 

 tip, and both sets directed forward. Labial palpi extremely short, almost ru- 

 dimentary. Tongue none. Abdomen equal in length to the hind wings. 

 Tibiae moderately ciliated exteriorly ; hind tibiae with two very short apical 

 spurs. 



This genus may, perhaps, be the same as Mr. Walker's Lagoa. 



P. lanuginosa. Female? The wings are badly worn and denuded. 

 Antennas pale brownish-yellow. Face dark brownish : head and body dull 

 yellow. The anterior tibiae and all the tarsi are dark brownish. The un- 

 denuded portion of the fore wings at the base, is woolly and pale brownish 

 yellow. 



Male ? Antennae yellowish white. Face and the fore legs blackish-brown, 

 the hairs white and all the tarsi blackish-brown toward the ends. Thorax 

 white, very slightly tinted with yellowish. Abdomen rather deep, dull yel- 

 low. Wings white, slightly tinted with yellowish ; fore wings woolly toward 

 the base, with a dark brownish discoloration along the upper part of the disk 

 and the costa adjoining it. 



The female ? of this species was ticketed by the collector Bombyx 1 a n u - 

 g i n o s u s , but I have not been able to find any description under this name, 

 nor any that designates the insect itself. 



From the Smithsonian Institution. Capt. Pope's coll. Texas. 



Limacodes Latreille. 



L. laticlavia . Body and fore wings rather dark ochreous-yellow. 

 Fore wings with an oblique silvery band, inclined toward the base of the wing, 

 from the costa to the middle of inner margin, and toothed toward the base on 

 the submedian nervure or fold. A rather faint dark reddish brown line, ex- 

 tends from the costal origin of the silvery band to the hind margin beneath 

 the middle. Hind wings pale ochreous-yellow. Abdomen rather reddisb- 

 ochreous. 



Larva. Outline elliptical somewhat pointed behind ; body flattened, with 

 the sides curving from a central ridge, flattened above. The ridge has a ver- 

 tical elevation at its sides above the body, growing less and less before and be- 

 hind, and terminates in front in a rounded margin and behind in an obtuse, 

 short spine. The body is smooth, with no distinct spined papulae, but the 

 edges of the ridge and the outline of the body are thrown into folds, subcre- 

 nated. The body is thickest in the middle where it curves anteriorly nnd 

 posteriorly. 



The general color of the body is pale green and dotted with numerous yel- 

 low points. The central ridge is bordered in front with yellow. 



The larva feeds on the underside of the leaf of maple in September, and the 

 imago from it appears in the spring. There is doubtless a spring brood of 

 larvae.

Var. laticlavia? Imago, brownish-luteous, sometimes inclining to yel- 

 lowish. Fore wings with an oblique silvery band from the costa to the mid- 

 die of the inner margin, toothed on the submedian fold and shaded behind with 

 blackish-brown, with a blackish-brown line from the costal origin of the silvery 

 band to the hind margin beneath the middle. Hind wings dark brown, yellow- 

 ish at the base. 



Three sp. from Robert Kennicott, Illinois. 



Adoneta. 



The characteristics in wing structure are ; that the subcostal nervure is re- 

 mote from the anterior margin, and gives off two marginal branches from the 

 disk, one near the middle and one near the end, and then subdivides beyond 

 the disk into an apical and post apical branch. The disco-central nervule 

 arises above the middle of the discal nervure at an angle, whence the nervure 

 curves to the first branch of the median. In the hind wings the costal and 

 subcostal intersect at their bases. The latter is bifid beyond the disk ; the 

 disco-central is continued to the base of the wing, attenuated within the disk, 

 and the discal nervure is straight on the costal side of it, and very oblique on 

 the median side ; with their points of junction separated. Median thre** 

 branched. 



Body rather slender, not pilose. Head small ; eyes quite small. Antenna- 

 rather more than one half as long as the body. Labial palpi somewhat ex- 

 ceeding the front, rather slender, nearly cylindrical, squamose above and slight- 

 ly hirsute beneath ; third joint very small, the development being chiefly in 

 the second joint. Tongue none. Abdomen much shorter than the hind 

 wings. Fore legs rather slender, tibise moderately ciliated ; middle and hind 

 tibiae thickly and shortly ciliated, with two rather short apical spurs. Wings 

 very much deflexed in repose, almost enveloping the body. Male. Tin- 

 basal half of the antennae shortly pectinated. Female. Antennae simple. 



A. voluta. Reddish-brown, somewhat paler in the 9 tnan tne <$ 

 Fore wings with a dingy yellow streak along the base of the inner margin, 

 extended toward the disk above the middle of the wing and on this portion 

 are two or three blackish dots. On the hind portion of the disk is a short 

 black streak. In the tf there is another short black streak along the median 

 nervure and its last branch, with a curved row of three, black, submargina! 

 spots. The lower streak and the spots are as distinct in the 9 as in the ^J 1 . 

 In both sexes there is a subapical dingy yellow patch, lightly bordered behind 

 with whitish. Hind margin spotted with black. Hind wing pale reddish 



brown. 



Larva. Body semi-cylindrical, tapering posteriorly and rounded obtusely 

 in front. Nearly smooth, but with a subvascular row of small fleshy, minute- 

 ly spined papulae on each side of the vascular line, three of which placed an- 

 teriorly are separated and distinct, and three approximated on the last rings : 

 the intermediate ones are minute. The outline of the body above the ven- 

 tral surface, is furnished with a row of minute spined papulae. 



Bright green, with a broad dorsal yellow band containing a reddish purple 

 one which is constricted opposite the second and third pairs of anterior papu- 

 lae and dilated into an elliptical patch in the middle of the body. This is 

 almost separated from a smaller elliptical patch which is constricted opposite 

 the third pair of posterior papulae and ends in a small round patch. The an- 

 terior and posterior papulae are crimson and the intermediate ones green. Th(^ 

 superventral row of spined papul|e are green. 



In September, on the leaf of Apricot. Imago in March. 



Empbetia. 



In the anterior wings the subcostal nervure is moderately remote from the 

 external margin, sends off two marginal branches from the disk, and beyond 



[May- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



it subdivides, first near the disk, into a subcosto-inferior branch, and then into 

 an apical and post apical branch. The discal nervure is very irregular, and 

 sends from its costal portion a disco-central nervule, whilst the middle of the 

 disk contains a bifid false nervule. The internal nervure is bifid at its base. 

 In the hind wings the costal and subcostal nervures intersect at their bases. 

 The subcostal is bifid near the disk. The costal portion of the discal nervure 

 is angulated, and forms likewise an acute angle in the middle of the disk, 

 whence a false nervule proceeds to the base of the wing, and obliquely joins 

 the median system, giving rise on the median side to a disco-central nervule. 



Body stout or very stout, thorax covered thickly with flat hairs. Head 

 quite small ; eyes small and oval. Labial palpi somewhat exceeding the head, 

 slightly curved, more robust in the <^ than in the 9 '> third joint small and 

 conical, about four times less long than the second and slightly hirsute be- 

 neath. Tongue none. Antennae rather more than one half the length of the 

 body. Abdomen shorter than the hind wings. Fore legs long and rather 

 slender ; fore tibiae and tarsi moderately ciliated ; middle and hind tibia? 

 thickly ciliated, with two moderate apical spurs on hind tibiae. Male. An- 

 tennae, basal half pectinated. Female. Simple. 



E. stimulea . Body and fore wings uniform dark ferruginous, with two 

 small subapical white spots, and in the $ two inore near the base of the wing 

 beneath the median nervure. Hind wings pale reddish-brown. 



Larva. Body semicylindrical, truncated obliquely before and behind, with 

 a pair of anterior, long, fleshy, subvascular slenderly spined horns and a pair 

 smaller beneath them, above the head ; a posterior similar pair and a smaller 

 anal pair beneath them. The superventral of papulae are rather large and 

 densely spined. After the last moulting the longer horns become moderate 

 in length. 



The portion of the body between the anterior and posterior horns is a fine, 

 bright green color, bordered anteriorly and superventrally by white, with a 

 central, dorsal, oval reddish brown patch bordered with white, which color is 

 again edged by a black line. The horns, papulae and anterior portion of the 

 body are reddish brown, with a small yellow spot between the anterior horns, 

 while the posterior pair are placed in a yellow patch. 



The spines with which the horns are supplied, produce an exceeding pain- 

 ful sensation when they come in contact with the back of the hand, or any 

 portion of the body on which the skin is thin. 



On a great variety of plants ; fruit trees, the rose, Indian corn, (Zea mays) 

 and a number of other plants. 



E. paenulata . Body dark reddish brown. Fore wings dark reddish- 

 brown along all the borders, with a large, central pea-green patch, extending 

 from the base of the wing to the subterminal portion, bordered narrowly on 

 the inner side and behind with white, and deeply indented opposite the mid- 

 dle of the inner margin, where there is a bright brown patch in the reddish 

 brown border. Hind wings yellowish brown. 



I do not know the larval state of this species, and have only two specimens, 

 both apparently females. I can perceive no differences in the structural char- 

 acters of the imago of this and the previous species, and am quite sure that 

 they belong to the same generic group. The discovery of the larval form will, 

 however, determine the question. 



From Mr. Robert Kennicott, Illinois. 



NOCHELIA. 



In the anterior wings, the subcostal nervure is remote from the external 

 margin, and the costal arises from its base ; it gives off a marginal branch 

 near the posterior end of the disk, and another exterior to the disk. The sub- 

 costo inferior branch arises nearly midway between this latter and the post- 



1860.] 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



apical, which is given off near the tip of the wing. The discal nervure is 

 doubly angulated, and gives rise to the disco-central nervule at the angle on 

 the costal side ; and from the central, a false nervule to the base of the wing. 

 Median four-branched. Internal bifid at the base. 



In the hind wings, the costal and subcostal have a common trunk. The 

 subcostal bifid beyond the disk. The subcostal and median portions of the 

 discal nervure are much separated at their points of junction with the disco- 

 central, which is continued as a false nervule to the base of the wing. 



Male. Body stout and very short ; thorax covered with fiat hairs. Head 

 and eyes moderate, the latter oval. Labial palpi slightly exceeding the front, 

 rather stout, porrect, third joint very minute. No tongue. Antennae much 

 more than one half as long as the body, with the basal third pectinated. Ab- 

 domen shorter than the hind wings. The middle and hind tibiae rather thick- 

 ly ciliated ; apical spurs of hind tibiae, if present, inconspicuous. 



N. tardigrada . Male. Body and fore wings rather dark reddish brown, 

 with a small, nearly triangular pea-green patch narrowly bordered with dark 

 brown at the base of the wing beneath the median nervure, slightly excavated 

 behind where it adjoins a bright brown patch. Towards the hind end of the 

 disk, in its middle, is a minute, oval dark brown streak ; two small pea-green 

 subapical spots, the one nearest the costa minute. 



Larva. The body is elliptical, much flattened above. There is on each 

 side a row of subvascular, minutely spined papulae, of which the three anterior 

 and two posterior are more conspicuous than the rest. The superventral row 

 of papulae are moderate, equal, and form the outline of the body. 



General color very pale green, with dorsal patches of the general hue beau- 

 tifully margined by crimson lines, and crimson, vascular patches, of which 

 those between the fourth undjifth, seventh and eighth pairs of subvascular papu- 

 lae are most conspicuous, although small. All the papulae pale green. 



On the apricot in September. Imago in April. 



I have descriptions of other larvae similar in physical characteristics to the 

 above, but have not succeeded in carrying them through their transforma- 

 tions. 



The genera Pimela, Limacodes, Adoneta, Empretia and Nochelia belong to 

 that most anomalous family Limacodidae. Perhaps some of the groups de- 

 scribed as new have been heretofore established, but I found the effort to 

 identify them from meagre and unsatisfactory diagnoses of the imago an 

 almost futile task. 



Attacus Hubner. 



The following species have never been described I believe, except by De 

 Beauvois, and as his work is now rather rare and an expensive one, and not 

 accessible to tbe great body of American entomologists, I insert here de- 

 scriptions of the following insects :

Dull reddish-brown. Thorax banded with white before and behind. Ab- 

 domen with a white stigmatal band edged above and beneath with black and 

 containing reddish brown spots. Fore wings with a basal white streak ex- 

 tending from the costa to the base of medio-posterior nervule and thence to 

 the inner margin at the base of the wing, bordered toward the base with 

 orange-yellowish and externally by black. The breadth of the disk is occu- 

 pied by a large trigonate vitreous patch, extended behind so as to interrupt a 

 white wavy, narrow band crossing the middle of the nervules and which is 

 bordered internally with black and externally with orange-yellowish. The 

 trigonate patch is edged within by white and externally by black behind and 

 before. Beyond the transnervular band, the wing is brown dusted with 

 blackish and powdered with whitish roseate in the medio-posterior and sub-

median interspaces behind the band. At the tip is a large whitish roseate 

 patch, three contiguous black spots at the end of post apical interspace, with 

 a wavy black, submarginal line. Hind margin luteo-testaceous. Hind wings, 

 trigonate vitreous patch somewhat larger than in fore wings, with a trans- 

 nervular band similar to fore wings, continued around the costa to the base 

 of the wing and the medio-posterior interspace and those adjoining it, 

 powdered with whitish roseate behind the band. Hind margin luteo-testa- 

 ceous with a row oflblack spots and a dark brown line.

TINEINA. 

 Anorthosia. 



Anterior wings rather narrow, and somewhat lanceolate. The subcostal 

 nervure is nearly straight and gives off from the disk, which is unclosed, 

 three marginal nervules and becomes bifid before the tip. The discal ner- 

 vule is independent. The median is four-branched, its last nervule is bifid, 

 and arises opposite the middle of the origins of the 2d and 3d subcosto 

 marginals. The submedian is bifid at its base. 



Hind wings somewhat emarginate behind the tip on the external mar- 

 gin, and rather deeply emarginate beneath the tip. Disk unclosed. Sub- 

 costal nervure bifid from the end of the disk. This discal nervule is trans- 

 ferred to the median side, and the median nervure is three-branched. 



Head and face smooth; vertex elongated, with long loose scales over- 

 lapping in the middle. Forehead rounded. Ocelli very small. Eyes small, 

 round and salient. Antenna? about one third less long than the anterior 

 wings, basal joint long and slender, the stalk slightly denticulated beneath. 

 Maxillary palpi extremely small. Labial palpi, smooth, long and porrected, 

 their development being almost entirely in the second joint, ivhich is sup- 

 plied above with long hairs capable of being erected, although usually decumb- 

 ent, and with the third joint short, very slender, smooth and pointed, arising 

 nearly erectly at the apical third of the second, and is likewise capable of being 

 erected or depressed. Tongue scaled at the base and about as long as the 

 labial palpi. 



A. p unc ti pen n e 11 a. Labial palpi and head rather dark ochreous, 

 the former dark brownish externally. Antennae ochreous, annulated with 

 dark brown. Fore wings rather dark ochreous, sometimes dusted with dark 

 brownish, with three pairs of blackish brown dots along the fold, the first 

 near the base of the wing, the second rather above the middle and the third 

 near its end. One dot of each of the latter pairs, is in the fold, the other 

 above it obliquely. The costa at the base, and beyond the middle is touched 

 with blackish, with the hinder portion of the wing dotted and dusted with 

 dark brown, especially along the hinder margin. Cilia ochreous. Hind 

 wings shining, blackish gray, cilia the same. Abdomen blackish.

This insect has doubtless been introduced into this country from Europe. 

 My own specimens were obtained from the W. D. Porter wheat, distributed by 

 the Patent Office at Washington City. The seed of this wheat was originally 

 procured from Mount Olympus in Asia, and from two heads of this as a be- 

 ginning was grown in the District of Columbia the grain distributed in the 

 years 1854 and 1855. The insect is probably common in the District.

 what suffused with a greenish hue, the latter black beyond the middle, with 

 a pale yellow band, somewhat hooked on the costa, at the apical third of the 

 wing. Hind wings blackish-brown, cilia the same. 



The larva may be found about the middle of June, nearly full fed, in the 

 leaves of Agrimony, (Agrimonia Eupatoria) which it rolls and binds together 

 with silken threads. The body of the full grown larva is colored obscure 

 green, dotted with black dots. Head and shield pale brown. The young 

 larva is flesh-colored and dotted with dark colored dots. The pupa is con- 

 tained in a slight cocoon, sometimes woven between the leaves of its food 

 plant, but usually it is abandoned to construct it. The pupa-case is not 

 thrust from the cocoon at the maturity of the insect. 



The June brood of larva become imagos during the latter part of June or 

 the beginning of July. 



Fore wings scarcely pointed. Secondary cell faintly indicated. Subcosto- 

 apical vein forked. The last branch of median bifid. Hind wings emarginate 

 before the tip and slightly beneath it ; with an intercostal cell at the base. 



G.? flavocostella . Labial palpi wanting. Head dull reddish yellow. 

 Antennae blackish-brown, yellowish toward the base. Thorax, disk black, 

 front and sides dull yellow. Fore wings black, with a broad, pale yellow 

 costal streak, extending from the base nearly to the tip of the wing, undula- 

 ting from the base to the middle of the wing and dilated into an angle at the 

 apical third, with a faint, yellowish streak produced from the apex of the 

 angle toward the inner angle of the wing. Hind wings dark brown, cilia the 

 same. 



This insect does not, probably, belong to the genus under which it is placed. 

 As the labial palpi are wanting, I include it here from its general structure 

 and appearance, not knowing otherwise where to place it. 



One specimen from A. I. Packard Jr., of Brunswick, Maine. 



The second joint of labial palpi moderately thickened. Hind wings deeply 

 emarginate beneath the tip, which is produced. 



G.? roseosuffusella . Labial palpi, second joint whitish spotted with 

 dark fuscous ; the third dark fuscous annulated with two white rings. Head 

 and thorax ochreous, tegulse with a dark-brown spot in front. Antennae 

 dark fuscous, annulated with whitish. Fore wings dark brown, ochreous 

 along the inner margin, where it is suffused with roseate. At the base of the 

 wing is a white spot containing a dark brown dot, and near the base an ob- 

 lique white band. About the middle of the wing is a large white spot or in- 

 distinct broad band, irrorated with dark brownish and tinted with roseate on 

 the inner margin. Near the tip is a costal white spot and a roseate spot

opposite on the inner margin, and a whitish spot at the tip. Cilia brownish 

 gray. Hind wings dark fuscous-gray, cilia fuscous. Feet annulated with 

 white. 



Fore wings scarcely pointed. Hind loings slightly emarginate beneath the tip, 

 with an intercostal cell at the base. 



G. Rhoifructella . Head, face and thorax grayish-fuscous. Labial 

 palpi rather dark ochreous. Antenna ochreous, annulated with black. Fore 

 wings grayish-fuscous dusted with dark brown, and with four dark fuscous 

 dots, one near the base of the fold, two near the middle of the wing, (one on 

 the fold and one above it, ) and one on the end of the disk. Near the end of 

 the wing is an indistinct grayish band. Hind wings fuscous, cilia the same. 



The larvae may be found in April or early in May, in the fruit spikes of sumach 

 (Rhus Typhina), where they feed on the crimson hairs and exterior envelope 

 of the drupes, without however eating the drupes themselves. The larvae are 

 concealed in galleries formed in the fruit spikes, and their presence is indicated 

 by strings of "frass" clinging to the exterior. The cocoon is a slight silken 

 web woven amongst the "frass" near the surface. The larva is immaculate, 

 and varies in color, from dark reddish-brown to a pale brown, dotted with 

 rows of darker colored dots, each giving rise to a hair ; the head is brown and 

 the shield blackish. The imago appears about the middle of June. 



Size small. Fore wings rather lanceolate and pointed. Hind wings deeply 

 emarginate beneath the tip, which is produced. The second joint of labial palpi 

 somewhat thickened. 



G.? rubidella . Head and face ochreous. Labial palpi yellowish white, 

 with two deep fuscous spots on the middle joint, and two blackish brown rings 

 on the terminal one, a narrow one near its base and a broad one near the tip, 

 while the tip is blackish. Antennae deep fuscous annulated with white. 

 Thorax fuscous, deep fuscous in front. Fore wings roseate, dusted with deep 

 fuscous, with a brownish ochreous streak along the inner margin from the 

 base to nearly the middle of the wing, and interrupted about its middle by a 

 roseate hue. At the basal third of the wing is an oblique deep fuscous band, ex- 

 tending from the costa to the fold, and beyond the middle of the costa is a 

 spot of the same hue, joined toward the inner margin by a brownish- 

 ochreous spot. The apical portion of the wing much dusted with deep fus- 

 cous ; cilia ochreous, with a fuscous hinder marginal line. Hind wings black- 

 ish gray ; cilia somewhat paler. Feet rather pale ochreous, spotted with deep 

 fuscous. 



G. flexurella. Head and face grayish fuscous. Labial palpi, second 

 joint dark fuscous, terminal joint white with a blackish ring at the base and 

 one near the tip. Antennae whitish annulated with dark fuscous. Fore 

 wings grayish fuscous, with a pale grayish band near the apex margined in- 

 ternally on the costa by a blackish brown spot, with another of the same hue 

 about the middle of costa and another on the costa near the base. Near the 

 base of the fold is a rather faint dark brownish spot, and the wing is sprinkled 

 with dark brown atoms. Hind wings dark fuscous, cilia ochreous gray. 



Variety ? Fore wings smoky fuscous, with a pale grayish band near the 

 tip, broadest and most distinct on the costa, margined broadly internally across 

 the wing, with dark brown, with a pale grayish spot between it and a dark 

 brown spot on the middle of costa. In the middle of the wing are two dark 

 brown spots, one on the basal part of the fold and a small one on the costa 

 above it of the same hue. Hind wings dark fuscous. 



G. mimella. Head and face tawny brown. Labial palpi, second joint 

 dark fuscous, with a whitish ring at its end ; third joint gray with a ring in 

 its middle. Antennae pale fuscous annulated with white. Fore wings tawny

dark brown. Along the costa are a few dark brown spots and a few in the 

 apical portion behind the ochreous band. Hind wings dark brown. 



Size small. Fore wings acutely pointed or lanceolate. Hind wings deeply 

 emarginate beneath the tip, which is produced. Labial palpi rather short ; middle 

 joint somewhat thickened with scales, terminal rather short. 



G.? deter sell a. Head and face grayish fuscous. Labial palpi pale 

 yellowish-white, with two fuscous patches on the middle joint, a very narrow 

 fuscous ring at the base of terminal joint, a broad one near the tip, with the 

 extreme apex whitish. Antennae grayish fuscous, annulated with dark fus- 

 cous. Fore wings grayish, very profusely dusted with dark fuscous, with a 

 dark fuscous spot on the disk ; cilia ochreous gray. Hind wings pale ochreous- 

 gray ; cilia pale ochreous. Feet annulated with whitish. 



I have found this genus a very difficult one. It is of great extent and in- 

 cludes individuals of a variety of aspects and more or less marked modifica- 

 tions in the labial palpi. The oral parts in the doubtful species correspond 

 so nearly to those of the genus, that I have concluded after much hesitation 

 not to place them in separate groups, notwithstanding the produced apex of 

 the hind wings in some of them. 



Strobisia. 



Fore wings obtuse and rounded behind. The subcostal divides into four 

 branches, with the apical branch simple or forked. The discoidal nervure 

 gives origin to a disco-central branch. The median is four-branched ; sub- 

 median forked at the base. Hind wings trapezoidal, not broader than fore 

 wings, with the hinder margin slightly emarginate beneath the tip. Subcos- 

 tal bifid from the discoidal, which gives rise to a disco-central vein. Median 

 three-branched, the two upper branches aiising at a common base. 



Head smooth with appressed scales. Forehead and face rounded. Ocelli 

 large. Eyes oval and obliquely placed. Labial palpi recurved, moderately 

 long ; second joint flattened, smooth with appressed scales ; third slender, 

 smooth and pointed. Maxillary palpi short and distinct. Antennae slender, 

 simple ; basal joint subclavate. Tongue scaled, nearly or quite as long as the 

 thorax beneath. 



The structure of the insects here included, closely approach that of the 

 genus Gelechia, in which I placed them in the first arrangement. I cannot 

 believe, however, that they are members of this group, and have hence re- 

 moved them. The perfect insects are most commonly found in shaded places, 

 on the surface of leaves. They are active and restless in their motions, and 

 turn in circles on their resting places, especially after short flights ; withal 

 they are disposed to be quarrelsome and drive away from the leaves on which 

 they may happen to be enjoying themselves, other " little people" of the 

 shaded wood. 



Fore wings obtusely rounded behind. Subcosto apical branch simple. Medio 

 posterior vein bifid. 



S. iridipennella . Head and thorax brown, with a greenish hue j 

 face whitish beneath. Labial palpi dull silvery. Antennae dark brown. Fore 

 wings dark brown, with a greenish-golden hue. Along the costa are three 

 metallic blue or violet-blue oblique streaks scarcely reaching the middle of 

 the wing, the first is longest and is placed about the middle of the costa, the 

 third near the tip, and with three spots of the same hue beneath the second 

 streak, one in the fold and two in the middle of the wing. In the apical por- 

 tion near the hind margin are three or four parallel similarly hued streaks 

 and at the base of the fold is a violet-blue spot. Hind wings brown, along 

 the base of costa pale yellow.

Fore wings obtuse, hind margin slightly oblique. Apical branch bifid. 

 S. emblemella . Head and thorax dark brownish, with a goMen hue ; 

 face whitish beneath. Labial palpi silvery gray ; third joint fuscous in front. 

 Antennae dark fuscous. Fore wings dark brown, somewhat golden. The 

 costa at the base and a basal band are dull silvery and rather behind the 

 middle of costa is an oblique silvery costal streak and about the middle 

 is a curved costal streak of the same hue. This unites with an oblique 

 silvery streak, from the middle of inner margin, and which becomes diffuse in 

 the middle of the wing. Near the tip at the beginning of the costal cilia, is a 

 small costal silvery spot and a row of spots or short parallel bluish silvery 

 streaks along the hinder margin. Cilia at the tip ochreous, containing a dark 

 fuscous line ; on inner margin dark fuscous. Hind wings dark brown, yel- 

 lowish along the costa ; cilia dark brown.

Hind wings 10th a medio-discal branch, in addition to the discocentral ; terminal 

 branch of median bifid. Transparent patch at base, quite distinct.

 white. Antennae dark fuscous. Fore wings whitish, much dusted with dark 

 fuscous. At the base is a white spot and the adjoining portion of the costa 

 dark fuscous ; behind the middle and near the tip is a whitish spot and oppo- 

 site the latter on the inner margin is a whitish spot nearly joining it, both 

 dusted with fuscous. Apical portion, dark fuscous, with a few whitish spots 

 on the margins ; cilia ochreous. Hind wings gray ; cilia pale ochreous. Feet 

 with tarsi annulated.

Ev AGORA. 



Fore wings rather narrow and obliquely pointed at the tip ; inner margin 

 slightly retuse beyond the middle. Discoidal cell closed by a faint, simple, 

 oblique nervure, given off from the subcostal near the third marginal branch ; 

 without disco-central nervule. The subcostal runs almost straight from the 

 base to the tip of the wing, giving off from the cell three marginal branches, 

 one near the middle of the wing and two near the end of the disk ; beyond the 

 disk it sends another branch to the costa, and before the tip becomes bifid send- 

 ing one branch above and another below the tip. The median subdivides into 

 four branches, which are aggregated at their origins, and, except the medio-pos- 

 terior, are long. The submedian is furcate at its base. Hind wings deeply 

 emarginate beneath the tip, which is abruptly produced, although short. 

 The discoidal cell is closed by a slight curved nervure, and is without a disco- 

 central nervule. The subcostal is bifid from the discal nervure, and the median 

 gives rise to a medio-discal nervule which curves much upward ; the last 

 branch of the median much removed from the two terminal branches which 

 are approximated. 



Size small, forehead rounded ; face rather narrow. Ocelli none. Eyes round, 

 moderately prominent. Antennae rather thick, simple, and about one half as long 

 as the fore wings ; basal joint rather slender but short. Labial palpi cylindrical, 

 rather short, middle joint slightly thickened toward its extremity, at least one 

 half longer than the terminal joint, which is somewhat roughened but slender 

 and pointed. Maxillary palpi not perceptible. Tongue scaled at the base, short, 

 not as long as the labial palpi. 



This genus shows some resemblance in structure to Parasia, but I think it 

 is very distinct,

ochreous internally, externally dark fuscous ; terminal joint with a fuscous 

 ring at the base and tip, extreme tip ochreous. Antennae dark fuscous, in- 

 distinctly annulated with ochreous. Fore wings brownish ochreous, with three 

 oblique dark streaks from the costa to the middle of the wing, bordered behind 

 with very pale ochreous,ihe first near the base, the second about the middle of costa, 

 the third near the tip with its pale ochreous margin extended across the wing. 

 Beneath the third streak are two dark fuscous spots, sometimes margined with 

 pale ochreous. At the tip are three dark fuscous dots, one nearly on the ex- 

 treme apex and two others behind it. Cilia of the tip somewhat dusted with 

 fuscous, the inner margin ochreous. Hind wings rather dark ochreous, cilia

Teichotaphk. 



Fore wings scarcely pointed, hind margin oblique, costa behind the tip deflex- 

 ed. The discoidal cell is closed and rounded behind . The subcostal nervure sends 

 four veins to the costa behind the tip, the last of which is furcate, and one to 

 hind margin beneath the tip from the cell. The median seuds four branches 

 to the hind margin, the last of which is furcate. Hind wings emarginate in 

 the middle of costa, and somewhat emarginate beneath the tip, with an 

 intercostal cell at the base ; subcostal bifid from the discal nervure which sends 

 a central branch to the hind margin. The median is three-branched. 



Head smooth, with appressed scales. Without ocelli. Eyes round and 

 moderately prominent. Labial palpi recurved ; middle joint slightly curved, 

 rather broad, compressed laterally, squamose on the sides and hairy toward 

 the end ; terminal joint slender, smooth, pointed and not so long as the middle 

 joint. Maxillary palpi short and distinct. Antennae rather more than one half 

 as long as the fore wings, somewhat denticulated and microscopically pubes- 

 cent beneath in the male? Tongue scaled at the base, nearly as long as the 

 thorax beneath. 



Middle joint of labial palpi much flattened ; hairy above and below, with diverging 



hairs. 

 T. setosell a. Head, face and thorax rather dark ochreous. Labial 

 palpi, middle joint blackish-brown externally, with the spreading hairs above 

 and beneath at the end, ochreous ; terminal joint ochreous tipped with fus- 

 cus, antennae fuscous, ochreous toward the base. Fore wings dark brown, slightly 

 dusted with pale ochreous. At the base of the costa is a pale ochreous irregu- 

 larly triangular patch, slightly dusted with fuscous, angulated on the upper 

 portion of the fold ; the angle is margined beneath with blackish brown, with 

 a small patch of the same hue between the angle and base of the wing, and a 

 large one behind it extending from the subcostal nervure to the fold. Across 

 the base of the nervnles runs a pale ochreous line, on each side of which the 

 wing is nearly uniform dark brown. Hind wings yellowish brown.

 ish brown, with an ochreous orange spot on the disk, one on the sub- 

 costal nervure nearer the base, one beneath it in the fold, and one on the end 

 of the disk, all of the same hue. On the costa near the tip is a small ochreous 

 orange spot, and the cilia which are somewhat paler than the general hue are 

 varied with shining ochreous. Hind wings dull yellowish brown. 



Callima. 

 Fore wings rather ovate, obtusely pointed. The subcostal nervure sends 

 four nervules to the costa, the last one furoate behind the tip, with both 

 branches above it. From the discal proceeds a disco-central nervule, and the 

 median subdivides into four branches. Submedian furcate at the base. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. -167 



The hind wings are much narrower and shorter than the fore wings, emargin- 

 ate in the middle of the costa, hind margin obtusely pointed and very oblique. 

 The costal ends in the middle of the wing. The subcostal is attenuated to- 

 wards the base, thediscal gives rise to two nervules and the median is three- 

 branched, the superior and central nervules arising in a short common stalk. 



Head smooth, with hair-like scales. Face quite narrow. Ocelli none. Eyes 

 round and quite prominent. Labial palpi long and recurved ; the middle joint 

 rather slender, smooth with appressed scales, slightly flattened, longer than 

 the third joint, which is slender, smooth and pointed. Maxillary palpi none. 

 Antennae inserted on the front, basal joint smooth and subclavate, slightly 

 denticulated beneath and microscopically pubescent (in the tf alone ?). 

 Tongue scaled at the base and somewhat longer than the anterior coxae. 



This insect, I think, must approach very nearly (Ecophora of Zeller if it is 

 not, indeed, a member of that genus. 



C. argenticinc t e 11 a. Head, face and thorax deep reddish orange. 

 Labial palpi, middle joint dark brown, terminal white with a broad dark brown 

 ring on its middle. Antennae silvery white annulated with blackish. Fore 

 wings yellowish orange. Along the basal margin of the wing from the fold to 

 the basal angle, is a silvery line black margined on both sides, and one 

 from the basal third of the inner margin, somewhat curved and not extended 

 to the costa, likewise silvery and black margined on both sides ; the basal 

 portion of the wing included between these lines is deep reddish orange. Near 

 the apical third of the wing is a silvery costal streak, curved and tapering 

 outwardly, slightly dark margined on the costa behind. Opposite this on the 

 inner margin, is a semicircular silvery line, black margined on both sides at its 

 beginning, which terminates in a dark brown spot, white margined exteriorly, 

 at the commencement of the cilia, before which the line becomes grayish sil- 

 very. The portion of the wing included within this line, is deep reddish 

 orange, as well as the apical portion, in which along the hind margin is a row 

 of silvery spots each slightly dark margined. Hind wings fuscous. Feet 

 annulated with white. 



Nomia. 



Fore wings rather narrowly ovate-lanceolate, discoidal e'en very narrow, long 

 and unclosed, with two independent discal nervules to the hinder margin beneath 

 the tip. The costal nervure is short. The subcostal nearly straight, sending 

 three nervules to the costa from the cell, the first from the middle of the wing, 

 and its last branch bifid, with both branches above the apex. The median is 

 two-branched, the one nearest the base bifid near its end. The submedian is 

 furcate at its base. 



Hind wings narrower than the fore wings, costa nearly straight, but slightly 

 curved ; apex decidedly produced, with the hind margin deepty and circularly 

 excavated beneath it and the anal angle rounded. The discoidal cell is broad 

 and unclosed, with a short independent discal nervule beneath the middle of 

 the wing. Subcostal nervure simple. Median three-branched, the first de- 

 livered to the inner margin rather behind the middle, the last to the rounded 

 anal angle. 



Head smooth, with appressed scales. Forehead and face broad and round- 

 ed. Ocelli none. Eyes oval, not prominent, flattened. Labial palpi short, 

 somewhat reflexed, smooth, rather slender and pointed ; terminal joint ex- 

 tremely short, much slenderer than the middle. Maxillary palpi not percepti- 

 ble. Antenna? about one half as long as the fore wings, rather thick, but taper- 

 ing, roughened ; basal joint rather slender and short. Tongue slender, scaled 

 at the base, longer than the anterior coxa?.

fuscous. Fore wings golden yellow. At the base of the costa is a dark golden 

 brown patch, not extended beyond the fold, and margined behind and beneatli 

 with iridescent silvery. On the inner margin near the base and extended to 

 the middle of the margin is a rather long patch of the same hue, with an iri- 

 descent silvery internal patch and touched exteriorly with the same hue. A 

 large trapezoidal golden brown patch on the middle of the costa is margined 

 internally by a rather broad iridescent silvery streak, which is slightly dark 

 margined internally, having also an external silvery streak produced in the 

 middle of the wing toward the apex and beneath it, at its interior angle, a 

 brownish silvery blotch, pointing to the inner margin at the beginning of the 

 cilia. In the apical portion of the wing is a silvery streak, dark margined on 

 both sides behind, pointing into the costal cilia above the apex. The costa 

 from the trapezoidal patch to the tip, is touched with dark brown ; cilia dark 

 brown ; beneath the apex varied with silvery on the base of the cilia. Hind 

 wings dark brownish. 



Trypanisma. 



Fore wings ovate-lanecolate. The discoidal cell is rather narrow and elong- 

 ately oval. The subcostal nervure sends three nervules to the costa, the last 

 from the end of the cell, together with the apical branch which curves at its 

 origin to send off a very short and faint discal nervure, and at its middle 

 gives rise to a costal branch, becomes furcate behind the tip and delivers a 

 branch above and one below the tip. The median is three-branched, the mid- 

 dle branch being bifid. Submedian furcate at the base. Hind wings narrower 

 than the fore wings, with an intercostal cell at the base ; apex produced, deep- 

 ly emarginate on hind margin and anal angle rounded. The costa is slightly 

 emarginate in the middle. The discoidal cell broad, and closed by a very faint 

 nervure from the middle of the subcostal, which is furcate near the tip. The 

 discal nervule arises near the median, which is three-branched, with branches 

 rather approximated. 



Size small. Head smooth, with appressed scales. Forehead and face rounded 

 and rather broad. OcellL.none. Eyes oval, moderately prominent. Labial 

 palpi moderate, arched ; middle joint slightly thickened with scales beneath, 

 terminal as long as the second, smooth, pointed and tapering from the middle. 

 Maxillary palpi not perceptible. Antennae slender and simple ; about oue half 

 as long as the fore wings ; basal joint subclavate. Tongue scarcely so long as 

 the labial palpi. 



T. prudens. Head pale yellowish white dusted with fuscous. Face 

 yellowish white. Labial palpi pale yellowish white, with two dark brown 

 spots on the second joint and two rings on the terminal of the same hue, one 

 at the base and one near the apex Thorax yellowish, dusted with fuscous. 

 Antennas fuscous slightly annulated with yellowish. Fore wings fuscous, 

 tinted with yellowish, with a small ochreous yellow patch on base of costa, 

 one of the same hue on the middle of inner margin, extended to the middle of 

 the wing and a band of the same hue near the tip, much angulated or nearly 

 interrupted in the middle of the wing Hind wings fuscous. 



The generic characters of this insect approach those of Evagora. The larva 

 lives within a silken web woven on the under surface of the leaves of chestnut 

 oak. It feeds on the cuticles and parenchyma of both sides of the leaf, gaining 

 the upper side by round holes eaten through its substance, and just large 

 enough to admit the body ; of these there were three at various points of 

 the eaten surface. If alarmed the larva immediately retreats through the 

 opening last made to the web on the xinder surface. The pupa is robust, 

 almost ovoid and is contained in a slight cocoon woven on the leaf on which the 

 larvae feed. I have no description of the larva. It was taken July 22d, became 

 a pupa on the 27th, and an imago on August 8th.

Anaesia ? Zeller. 



Fore wings ovate-lanceolate ; with an opaque space on the costa, towards the 

 end of the costal nervure and the first subcosto-marginal branch. Discoidal 

 cell rather narrow, closed by a short nervure. The subcostal sends four 

 branches to the costa, the first from a point rather behind the middle of the 

 wing, much separated from the second, and the last furcate on the costa be- 

 fore the tip, and a simple branch beneath the latter to inner margin just be- 

 neath the tip of the wing. The median subdivides into four branches, rather 

 approximated at their origins, the medio-posterior branch being nearly opposite 

 to the second marginal. Subcostal furcate at the base. Hind wings trapezoidal, 

 costa refuse, slightly emarginate beneath the tip, hind margin obliquely 

 rounded ; broader than the fore wings. Subcostal nervure rather attenuated 

 toward the base, with a faintly formed intercostal cell, furcate. Discoidal cell 

 broad, closed, with a nervule given off to the hind margin. Median three- 

 branched, medio-posterior branch distant from the others. 



Head smooth, covered thickly with decumbent scales. Forehead broad, al-

I have three specimens of the insect belonging to this genus, but none of 

 them show the peculiar structure of the palpi of the European male. Whe- 

 ther mine are all females or whether the individuals are generically distinct from

 must be left for future determination.

The larva was taken June 16th, full grown and about to transform on the 

 limbs of the plum. Its head is black, body uniform reddish-brown with indis- 

 tinct papulae, each giving rise to a hair, and with pale brown patches on the 

 sides of the 3d and 4th segments ; shield and terminal prolegs, black. One 

 specimen had secreted itself under a turned up portion of the old bark of the 

 trunk. The cocoon is exceedingly slight, and the tail of the pupa is attached 

 to a little button of silk. The pupa is ovate, abdomen short and conical,

 the larva feeds. 



Stilbosis. 



Fore wings narrow and pointed. Discoidal cell open, elongated and very 

 narrow. Subcostal nervure, with tbree nervules to the costa from the cell, and 

 an apical branch which sends a nervule to the costa from its middle, and is bifid at 

 the tip of the wing; the apical branch is nearly absolete from the third to the 

 fourth marginal branch. Beneath the apical is a discal nervule, which is obso- 

 lete posteriorly from its middle. The median is tbree-branched ; the submedi- 

 an, simple. Hind wings setaceous ; the discoidal cell is open and moderately 

 broad toward the base of the wing. The subcostal is obsolete toward the base 

 and bifid at the tip of the wing ; a discal nervule beneath it is obsolete posteriorly 

 from its middle. The median subdivides into three separate branches. 



Head and face perfectly smoo h. Ocelli none. Eyes small,' oval and visible 

 in front. Labial palpi moderate, somewhat curved, slender, smooth and 

 pointed ; terminal joint as long and as thick as the middle, and very acute at 

 its apex. Antennae rather thick, simple, somewhat roughened, rather short ; 

 basal joint smooth and subclavate. Tongue short. 



This genus is nearly related to Cosmopteryx of Hiibner, but the labial pal- 

 pi are much less developed, and the tongue much shorter. 



S. tesquell a. Head and face grayish-silvery, having a greenish splen - 

 dent lustre. Labial palpi ochreous. Antennae dark fuscous. "Fore wings fus- 

 cous-golden, tinted along the base of costa with reddish-violet; with three 

 patches of raised scales, one in the fold near the base, one behind the middle of 

 the wing, and one near the tip on the inner margin, the latter two are large and 

 extended nearly to the costa. In certain lights these raised patches are golden 

 internally, while the spaces of the wing between them become dark fuscous and 

 with the light striking the wing from the tip the patches are dark ochreous 

 and the last is extended obliquely into the costa as a streak of the same hue. 



The tip of the wing is reddish- violet, in certain lights dark fuscous. The cilia 

 are very long and are extended along the hind margin beyond the middle of 

 the wing ; fuscous tinged with reddish. Hind wings dark fuscous, cilia the 

 same. 



Laverna Curtis. 



Fore wings pointed, oblique along the hinder margin, with five veins be- 

 neath the furcate apical vein. Discoidal cell narrow. Submedian furcate at 

 each end; basal fork long, the apical fork shorter. Hind wings rather refuse 

 on the costa before the tip ; hind margin rounded or cimetar-shaped from base 

 to apex. The subcostal is obsolete toward the base, simple, and runs into the 

 costa before the tip. Discoidal cell closed, with a discal vein furcate at the 

 tip. Median three-branched, the last two arising on a common base. 



Head smooth ; backhead or vertex elongated. Forehead obtuse, advanced ; 

 face retreating. Eyes oval, visible in front. Labial palpi moderately long, 

 curved, smooth but rather loosely scaled ; second joint flattened toward its end, 

 subclavate ; the third short, smooth and pointed. Antennae rather more than 

 one half as long as the fore wings, simple, setaceous, basal joint subclavate. 

 Tongue sparingly scaled, extremely short, not one-half as long as the labial 

 palpi.

L. luciferella. Head and face silvery, tinged with yellowish. Back- 

 head dark fuscous. Labial palpi silvery ; middle joint dark fuscous from the 

 base to the middle, the terminal joint with a minute fuscous dot at its base. 

 Antennae dark fuscous. Fore wings dark reddish fuscous, with a large, rather 

 faint bluish silvery patch at the base, one on the middle of the costa, and a 

 curved band near the tip of the wing, of the same hue. On the fold beneath the 

 costal patch, is a patch of raised scales, and another on the inner margin join- 

 ing the band behind. Exterior to the band the wing is touched with ochreous, 

 containing in the middle a short dark fuscous streak, sometimes a pale yel- 

 lowish white streak margined with dark fuscous, and on the costa just behind 

 it, is a short pale yellowish-white streak, margined exteriorly with dark fus- 

 cous. Apical portion of the wing is dark fuscous ; cilia of inner margin fus- 

 cous. Hind wings fuscous, cilia the same. 



Fore wings slenderly and shortly caudate at the tip. Apical vein with 

 a long fork, with an independent discal nervure beneath it. Median four- 

 branched. Submedian with a long basal fork, no apical fork, but with the 

 end of the fold thickened. Labial palpi recurved, thickened at the end of 

 second joint with loose scales ; the third rather long, smooth and pointed. 

 Tongue nearly as long as the anterior coxae. 



L. Eloisella. Head, face and thorax silvery white, the latter spotted 

 with blackish. Labial palpi white, with a dark brown spot on the middle of 

 second joint, and two dark brown rings on the third, one at the base and 

 one at the tip. Antennae tawny yellow, white at base. Fore wings silvery 

 white, with a small tuft of tawny scales at the basal third of the fold, and a 

 larger patch of the same hue on the inner margin at the end of and above the 

 fold. Between the tufts, is an oblique dark brownish costal streak, nearly 

 joined at an angle by another of the same hue in the middle of the wing and 

 exterior to the first tuft ; the fold is tinted with golden yellow. Exterior to 

 the second tuft is a blackish-brown streak, which becomes diffuse behind and 

 above, while the apical portion of the costa to the slender apex of the wing is 

 golden yellow. At the base, beneath the fold, is a blackish-brown spot, and 

 another of the same hue beneath the fold equidistant from the first and the 

 first tuft of scales, and on the costa midway between these latter is a rather 

 faint dark brownish spot. Cilia yellowish gray. Hind wings tawny-grayish, 

 cilia ochreous. 



Cheysocorys Curtis. 



C. Erythriella . Head, face and thorax fuscous, with a greenish-brassy 

 hue. Labial palpi ochreous, terminal joint fuscous. Antennae bronzy -yellow- 

 ish fuscous. Fore wings reddish-fuscous, with a greenish-brassy hue ; cilia 

 fuscous. Hind wings reddish fuscous, cilia the same. 



Specimens of this insect reared by myself were much smaller than those 

 taken on the wing, had less of the brassy hue and were nearly uniform grayish 

 fuscous, but I have no doubt it is the same insect. 



The larva feeds on the fruit racemes of Sumach. It tapers anteriorly and 

 posteriorly, incisures deep, segments elevated in the middle, with a single 

 row of transversely arranged epidermic points on each ring, each one giving rise 

 to one or two rather stiff hairs ; abdominal legs very slender and short, termi- 

 nal placed posteriorly. Head with a few hairs, ellipsoidal, pointed rather 

 small, and pale brown. The body is uniform dark green. ' Frass " scarlet. 



The cocoon was woven on the outside of the raceme. It was ovoid, and ap- 

 peared to consist of coarse silk and but a single thread, being woven so as to 

 leave large meshes, enabling one to see the pupa through it distinctly. At 

 maturity the pupa case is thrust forth. The pupa is pale green, with the 

 head-case distinctly separated from the case of the thorax. The length of the 

 larva is about two lines, of the pupa about one and a half. 



The larva may be taken in July ; the imago appears early in August and

Elachista Treitschke. 

 I would beg here to call the student's attention to the fact, that the genus 

 described in Paper No. 3, January, 1860, under the name Cosmiotes, is the same 

 as the present one. I much regret the existence of this error ; it is not, how- 

 ever, necessary to state how I came to be misled. 



Median vein of hind trings two-branched. Apical vein of fore wings with a 

 branch from its middle to the costa, bifid at the tip; median vein two-branched. 



E. prsematurella . Head, face and labial palpi grayish fuscous. An- 

 tennae rather dark fuscous. Fore wings fuscous with a purplish hue. Rather 

 behind the middle of the wing is a white band, silvery-hued, and near the 

 tip a costal and opposite dorsal spot of the same hue. Extreme apex of the 

 wing white, with a row of dark brown atoms in the cilia, which are fuscous. 

 Hind wings bluish-gray, cilia fuscou-< with a reddish hue. 



The imago may be taken on wing early in April. 



Brenthia. 



Fore wings almost cuneiform, rounded behind. The subcostal nervure sends 

 a vein to the costa from the middle of the cell, and subdivides into two branches 

 at the point of junction with the discoidal nervure ; arising from this are five 

 veins to the hinder margin, and the median nervure subdivides into two 

 branches at its tip. The subcostal is furcate at its base. The hind wings are 

 broad, irregularly oval. The subcostal is simple. The discoidal does not 

 join it, gives rise to three veins to the hind margin, and is deflected towards 

 the base. The median is two-branched, the upper one being bifid about its 

 middle. 



Head smooth. Forehead and face rounded. Ocelli large. Eyes oval, and 

 rather prominent. Labial palpi moderately long, rather slender, pointed and 

 somewhat squamose : the terminal joint shorter than the second. Antenna? 

 slender, simple in the $, rather densely ciliated in the tf. Tongue slightly 

 scaled and very short. 



The insect belonging to this genus, which is nearly allied to Glyphipteryx 

 of Hiibner, has the curious habit of strutting about broad leaves in shaded 

 places, with its fore wings somewhat spread and the hind wings turned 

 forward at right angles to the costa of the fore wings, so as to display the 

 surface of the under pair. It is easily recognized by this characteristic alone. 



B. pavonacella . Head and thorax fuscous; face whitish beneath. Labial 

 palpi white, with three fuscous rings, one at the end of the second joint, one at 

 the base of the terminal and one near its tip. Antennae fuscous, annulated with 

 white. Fore wings fuscous, mottled with whitish, especially on the middle of 

 the wing, with a fuscous spot on the middle of the disk, ringed with whitish. 

 Near the hinder margin is a black band, not extended to the costa nor the 

 inner margin, with two sharp indentations of the general hue internally, and 

 containing on its middle a streak of brilliant scarlet-blue metallic scales. 

 Along the costa are one or two faint spots of the same hue. Hind wings 

 fuscous, whitish at the base and along the costa, with a short white line 

 near the hind margin, above the inner angle of the wing, and a rather faint 

 scarlet-blue metallic hued band on the hind margin, from near the tip to 

 beyond the middle. The under surface of both wings show a metallic hued 

 subterminal band. 



Imago on wing in July and August.

 Fore wings narrow, elongated, pointed and very slightly refuse on the costa 

 before the tip. The subcostal sends to the costa. beyond the apical third of

the wing, a long, thick rein which arises hehind the middle, and subdivides 

 into three branches at its tip, the apical being forked, with one of its branches 

 delivered to the tip, and the other to the costa before it. The discoidal cell 

 is much elongated and narrow, and sends to the hinder margin a disco-central 

 branch. The median is three-branched at its tip, all of which are short, and 

 the two upper veins arise on a common stalk. Submedian is forked at the 

 base, with the lower branch nearly obsolete. Hind wings narrowly lanceolate, 

 broad at base, with interior basal angle rounded. The subcostal vein is simple, 

 and extended to the tip. Discoidal cell closed by a very faint nervure, giving rise 

 to a simple nervule. Median nervure is three-branched, the last two branches 

 from a common base. 



Head smooth, with decumbent scales, slightly retracted. Forehead broad 

 and rounded ; face, with the scales spreading out at the base of the tongue, so 

 as to make it nearly equally broad. Eyes oval, vertically placed, Ocelli 

 small. Labial palpi very short, smooth ; first and second joints rather thick ; 

 terminal joint pointed, slender, and as long as the second. No maxillary 

 palpi. Antennas setaceous, simple in the V > microscopically pubescent in 

 the (j\ rather more than one-half as long as the fore wings ; basal joint 

 flattened and expanded into a small eye-cap, with cilia in front. Tongue 

 scaled, rather longer than the thorax beneath. 



I have but one male, which is without labial palpi. With the aid of good 

 lenses, I cannot make out whether they have been broken off, or whether 

 they are naturally obsolete. Otherwise, the head is in most perfect condition. 



The genera Zelleria and Ocnerostoma are congeneric with this in the 

 neuration of the wings, especially the hinder pair in the latter genus. 



P. laticapitella . Head, face and thorax shining tawny fuscous. Labial 

 palpi dark fuscous. Antennas fuscous, basal joint tawny fuscous. Fore wings 

 dark fnscons, with a rufous tinge, sprinkled with white, especially toward the 

 tip, with an indistinct whitish band behind the middle of the wing ; cilia pale 

 rufo-fuscous. Hind wings greyish-fuscous ; cilia the same. 



Parasia ? Duponchel. 



Fore wings lanceolate. The subcostal nervure sends three veins to the 

 costa, the first from the middle of the cell, and an apical branch which 

 delivers from its middle a branch to the costa, and is forked before the tip, with 

 one of the branches above and the other beneath it. The discoidal cell is 

 closed, but gives rise to no nervule. The median fan-branched, more 

 separated than in Evagora, and all the branches long. Submedian is forked 

 at the base. Hind wings with the apex produced. The submedian is forked 

 beyond the discal nervure, which gives rise to a disco-central branch. The 

 median is three-branched. 



Head smooth, with loose, decumbent scales. Forehead advanced ; globose, 

 face retreating. Ocelli small. Eyes oval, vertically placed, but little visible 

 from the front. Labial palpi rather short, recurved, smooth, with appressed 

 scales ; second joint thick, subclavate ; third joint short, very acuminate. 

 Maxillary palpi snort, distinct. Antennse simple, setaceous, one-third less 

 long than the fore wings. Tongue clothed with scales, scarcely as long as the 

 anterior coxae. 



This insect and Evagora apicitripunctella certainly approach each 

 other closely in structure ; nevertheless, they are very different in appearance. 

 The hind wings differ from those of Parasia in the produced apex being 

 straight, and slightly in neuration. 



P. ? subsimella . Head, face and thorax ochreous-fuscous. Labial palpi, 

 second joint dark brownish, ringed with whitish at its tip ; third joint white, 

 terminal half black. Antennae dark fuscous, basal joint striped with yellowish 

 in front. Fore wings dark ochreous-fuscous ; along the costa from its middle, 



I860.] 




174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



and toward the tip, brown ; and in the latter part much sprinkled with whitish. 

 On the middle of the costa is a short, yellowish white streak, and in the 

 apical third of the wing is an oblique line of the same hue, meeting in the 

 middle of the wing another of the same hue from the inner margin. At and 

 beneath the tip is a blackish brown spot, and in the cilia a dark fuscous line. 

 Hind wings dark ochreous, cilia the same. 



Depressaria Haworth. 



D. Lecontella. Head and face ochreous. Labial palpi ochreous: 

 second joint varied, externally with fuscous ; third joint with a slight fuscous 

 ring at the base, and one near the tip. Antenna? fuscous. Thorax ochreous, 

 with two blackish brown dots before. Fore wings dark ochreous, with dis- 

 persed blackish brown dots throughout the wing, two of which, about the 

 middle of the median nervure, are more conspicuous than the others ; 

 cilia rather pale ochreous. Hind wings pale grayish-ochreous, cilia the same. 



This is the only true Depressaria I have found thus far ; but we have other 

 nearly allied species, which differ from it in the structure of the labial palpi. 

 In this respect they resemble somewhat Gelechia r u f e s c e n s of Europe, but 

 differ from the genus to which it belongs in several particulars. I think 

 they must form a group intermediate between Depressaria and Gelechia. 



I have now nearly worked up my collection of Tineina, and would beg those 

 who feel interested in the continuation of these studies, to aid me in extending 

 my knowledge of species, by contributing collections from their various neigh- 

 borhoods. 



Description of a new species of Marginella. 

 BY JOHN H. REDFIELD. 

 Marginella roscida Redf. 



T. rhombico-ovata, polita, cinereo-lutescente, albido guttulata, versus 

 apicem albido-lineata ; labis albo, crasso, reflexo, extus fulvo trimaculato, 

 intus subdenticulato ; spira modica ; anfractus quatuor exhibente ; anfractu 

 ultimo angulato, juxta aperturam calloso ; columella quadriplicate. 



Shell rhombic-ovate, polished, light grayish brown, minutely necked with 

 white ; towards and upon the spire the white spots tend to be confluent in 

 longitudinal lines. Lip white, well thickened, obtusely reflected, extending a 

 little upon the penultimate whorl, slightly denticulate within, and bearing 

 three brown spots, one at its junction with the spire, a second about midway, 

 and the third near the base. Spire moderate, apex slightly colored, with 

 about four whorls visible ; the last whorl is distinctly shouldered, a little be- 

 neath the suture and near the aperture shows a vitreous deposit. Columella 

 with four plaits ; upper ones somewhat oblique, lower ones more so. Aper- 

 ture yellowish brown within. Length 0*57 in. (14 millim.) ; breadth 0*32 in. 

 (8 millim.) 



Habitat. Coast of South Carolina. 



Remarks. The general form of this shell is nearly that of M. apicina Menke, 

 and the spots upon the outer lip give it a further likeness to some varieties of 

 that species, but the spire is more developed, and the last whorl more dis- 

 tinctly angular than is usual in M. apicina, while the latter never displays 

 the minute white flecking of the species under consideration. This last feature 

 is common also to M. guttata, M. nivosa and M. pruinosa, but all these are 

 quite different in form and in development of spire.

CRETACEOUS SPECIES. 



CEPHALOPODA. 



Genus Phylloteuthis, M. & H. 



Phylloteuthis subovatds, M. &. H. The specimens on which we propose to 

 found this genus and species consist of the expanded portion of the pen or 

 gladius. This organ seems to have been corneous, and is thin, very wide or 

 subovate in form, a little concave on the under side, and convex above. From 

 behind the middle it narrows towards the front, the outline of the lateral mar- 

 gins being convex, while the posterior end is more or less obtusely angular. 

 The shaft is broken away in our specimens, but that portion of it extending 

 backward and forming the midrib of the expanded part, is narrow, prominent, 

 and rather sharply carinate above, while on the under side it is merely repre- 

 sented by a narrow groove. The lateral expansions are crossed a little ob- 

 liquely backward and outward, at an angle of about 65 from the midrib, by 

 numerous slender, ridged parallel striae, which are very nearly straight, or very 

 slightly curved backward near the outer margins. Length of expanded part, 

 exclusive of the shaft, 1-55 inch; breadth of do., 0-82 inch. 



Apparently near the Liassic genera Beloteuthis and Teudopsis, or at any rate 

 to species that have been, with doubtful propriety, ranged in these groups. 



Locality and position. Moreau River, in formation No. 5. 



Helicoceras angulatum Of this shell we have seen but a single nonseptate 

 fragment, 2-78 inches in length, with a diameter of 1-50 inches at the larger end, 

 and 1-37 inches at the smaller. It is rounded, or subcylindrical, and makes a 

 broad (sinistral?) spiral curve, in such a manner that if continued around, the 

 volutions would be disconnested, and encircle an umbilical cavity apparently 

 more than three times their own breadth. The surface is ornamented by dis- 

 tinct angular costae, which pass around the whorls obliquely and support two 

 rows of nodes on the lower outer side, where they sometimes bifurcate. Septa 

 unknown. 



Locality and position. Head of south branch of Shyenne River, in the upper 

 part of formation No. 4, of the Nebraska series. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 177 



Ammonites placenta, var. intercalaris. It is possible this shell may be spe- 

 cifically distinct from A. placenta of Dekay, but it agrees with that species so 

 nearly that we are in doubt about the propriety of considering it entitled to 

 rank as a species. It differs externally from the typical forms of Dekay's 

 species, in being rather less compressed, and in having a slightly larger umbili- 

 cus, while instead of a single series of scarcely perceptible transversely elon- 

 gated prominences on each side, it has a row of small, but distinct nodes a 

 little less than one-third of the way across from the dorsum, and another more 

 prominent series near the umbilicus. It also differs in having a row of small, 

 pinched, alternating nodes on each of the two dorsal angles. 



With these external differences, however, the septa of the shell under con- 

 sideration, are so very similar in all their details to those of A. placenta, that 

 we are at present inclined to regard it as a variety of that species. 



It is also worthy of note, that the form before us is closely related to A. syr~ 

 talis of Morton, being in fact almost exactly intermediate between that shell and 

 A. placenta, as well in form and external ornaments, as in the characters of its 

 septa. Its exact relations to these species can perhaps only be settled by a 

 careful comparison of a more extensive series of specimens than has yet been 

 obtained ; in the mean time it may be made known as a subspecies, under the 

 name A. placenta, var. intercalaris, and should it prove distinct, it may take the 

 latter as a specific name. It seems to attain a large size. Our specimen, which 

 consists of inner septate whorls, is 5-70 inches in its greatest diameter, with 

 a thickness or convexity of 1-62 inches. 



Locality and position. Sheyenne River, in the upper part of Formation No. 4 

 of the Nebraska Cretaceous series. 



Ammonites Vermilionensis, M. & H. Shell compressed discoidal ; umbilicus 

 large, very shallow, and showing about four-fifths of each inner whorl ; volu- 

 tions five or more, rather sharply carinated around the middle of the dorsum, 

 and ornamented on each side by nearly straight, simple, moderately strong, 

 obtuse costae, which show a tendency to develope nodes at each extremity. 

 Greatest diameter 1-05 inches ; convexity about 0-29 inch. 



Locality and position. Mouth Vermilion River, in Formation No. 2, of the 

 Nebraska section. 



Scaphites Warreni, M. & H. Shell small, transversely subovate, moderately 

 compressed, rounded on the dorsum ; umbilicus rather small; volutions sub- 

 cylindrical, height and breadth nearly equal, increasing gradually in size ; non- 

 septate portion of last turn slightly compressed laterally, and deflected from 

 the regular curve of the others, so as to become nearly or quite disconnected 

 at the aperture. Surface of the inner whorls ornamented by numerous small 

 costae, which increase chiefly by implantation, and all cross the dorsum very 

 regularly without arching; on the sides of the non-septate outer chamber, 

 about every fourth or fifth one of the costae is much more prominent and 

 sharper than the others, and extends quite across to the umbilical side, while 

 those between die out, or coalesce with the others at various distances. 



Length 1-45 inches ; height about 1-22 inches ; breadth 057 inch. 



Locality and position. Near the Black Hills, in formation No. 2 of the Ne- 

 braska Section. 



Scaphites nodosus, var. plends. We suspect the noble specimen we here 

 propose to notice provisionally, as a variety of Dr. Owen's Scaphites nodosus, may 

 prove to belong to a distinct species, but as we are not yet fully satisfied on 

 this point, it is perhaps better to regard it, for the present, as a marked variety 

 of Dr. Owen's species; and should further comparison demonstrate that it is 

 entitled to rank as a species, it can take as a specific name that by which we 

 have designated it as a variety. It differs externally from Dr. Owen's figure of 

 S. nodosus, in being greatly more ventricose, and snorter in proportion to its 

 height, while its inner rows of nodes are much smaller and nearer the umbili-

Locality end position. From the upper beds, containing Permian types of 

 fossils, on Cottonwood creek, Kanzas Territory. 



Note. In going carefully over these extensive collections, we have in addition 

 to finding the new species here described, succeeded in working from the matrix, 

 better specimens of many of those already published by us, than had been pre- 

 viously obtained. The additional information derived from these, and a more 

 careful review of the subject has enabled us to make several corrections 

 in the synonyma, as well as in the generic references, a list of which is given 

 below. 



It will also be observed, that we have made quite a number of other changes, 

 in order to range the species under the oldest generic names proposed after the 

 introduction by Linnaeus, of the binomial system. We must confess, however, 

 that we have some doubts whether science is to be much benefitted by a strict 

 observance of the law of priority, in such cases as those where it becomes 

 necessary to change long established names. We nevertheless make some 

 such changes in conformity with usages rapidly gaining ground, and probably 

 destined soon to become universal amongst conchologists and laborers in other 

 departments of Natural History. 



The transfer of several species formerly published under the names Hamites, 

 Ancylocerasl and Turrilites, to the genus Helicoceras, has been made in accord- 

 ance with the views of Mr. Daniel Sharpe, (Fossil Mol. Chalk, England, part 

 3d, Cephalopoda, p. 59, Paleont. Soc.) who refers all the so called Turrilites 

 having rounded whorls, with the siphuncle placed on the dorsal or outer side, to 

 the genus Helicoceras, whether the whorls are in contact or not. The genus 

 Turrilites, he restricts to those forms having more or less angular contiguous 

 whorls, with the siphuncle located near the suture. The fact of the whorls of 

 those forms with rounded volutions being in contact or not, can scarcely be 



[May,

regarded in all cases, of even specific importance, since it is now well known 

 that in some instances the same species presents both these peculiarities, and 

 sometimes the whorls of one part of the spire are in contact, and in others dis- 

 connected, even in the same individual. 



Our specimens confirm Mr. Sharp's views, for although they are but mere 

 fragments, it is evident they are parts of spiral shells, presenting intermediate 

 gradations between forms with whorls barely in contact, and others in which 

 they are clearly disconnected. 



Mr. D'Orbigny describes the septa of the genus Helicoceras as being un- 

 symmetrical, like those of Turrilites, this, however, is not always the case in 

 species, the whorls of which make a very broad curve around a large umbilical 

 cavity, for in some of our specimens of this kind, the corresponding lobes on 

 opposite sides of the siphuncle, present scarcely the slightest inequality, and 

 in other instances seem to be as nearly symmetrical as in Hamites, or any of 

 the allied genera.

186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Descriptions of Fourteen new species of Schizostomae, Anculosae and Lithasiae. 



BY ISAAC LEA. 



It will be observed that I have in this paper adopted my first name (Schizos- 

 toma) for the division of those Melanida which have a cut or fissure in the 

 upper portion of the last whorl. This name I proposed in December, 1842. 

 Subsequently finding that it was used by Bronn in 1835 I abandoned it, and 

 proposed the name of Sckizochilus as a substitute, (Obs. on the Genus Unio, 

 v. 5, p. 51, 1852.) I am now satisfied that Bronn's name was applied to the same 

 g enus Euomphalus which Sowerby established in 1814, (Min. Conch, tab. 45.) 

 This evidently liberates my original name, and Herrrcannsen, in the Appendix 

 to his"Generum Malacozorum," very properly restores it. It was supposed 

 that this was the Melatoma of Swainson, and Mr. Anthony adopted this name. 

 But it is evident that Mr. Swainson's Melatoma is not my Schizostoma. By refe- 

 rence to his figure (Malacology, p. 342, f. 104) it will be observed at once that 

 there has never been observed in the United States any of the group of which 

 that figure is the type, while it is known that they exist in the islands of the 

 Indian Ocean. Mr. Swainson says (p. 202) that his Melatoma was "founded 

 upon a remarkable Ohio shell " sent by Rafinesque. Now, as no member of the 

 family Melanidce with a cut in the lip has ever been found in the Ohio, where 

 such hosts of active collectors have since pursued their investigations, it is 

 perhaps beyond the bounds of possibility that the specimen sent by Rafinesque, 

 so eminently careless and reckless as he always was, should ever have been 

 found there. Indeed, if the specimen figured was sent by Mr. Rafinesque to 

 Mr. Swainson, then the question would arise whether it had not been obtained 

 by Mr. R. from some dealer or collector, who may have obtained it from Asia. 

 I have no doubt of the Melatoma costata, which Mr. Swainson has figured, 

 being exotic, and belonging to a group probably from the Philippine Islands. 

 Mr. Anthony says, page 64, Proc. A. N. S. 1860, that "it may be doubted 

 whether Mr. Lea's first name will not eventually prevail, since, before he pub- 

 lished Schizostoma, Bronn's genus of the same name had been called a synonym 

 of Bifrontia, Desh." And that " H. and A. Adams (Gen. Rec. Moll. 1, 105) do 

 not appear correct in giving preference to Gyroloma over Schizostoma, Lea," &c. 

 Notwithstanding this, Mr. Anthony in this paper, where he describes nine sup- 

 posed new species of this genus, adopts the generic name of Oyrotoma. It may 

 be added here that Dr. Gray, in his Genera of Recent Mollusca, gives Melatoma to 

 Mr. Anthony, not to Swainson, while he does not notice the name of Schizos- 

 toma. Mr. A. does not pretend to claim it, of course, but adopts Gxjrotoma, 

 Mr. Shuttleworth's name, proposed in 1845, which being three years later 

 cannot have precedence. 



The genus Schizostoma seems to be capable of being divided into two natural 

 groups in the form of the fissura, the cut in the lip. In one group this fissura 

 is deep and direct, that is parallel with the suture or upper edge of the 

 whorl ; in the other it is not deep and is oblique to the suture. 



In Mr. Anthony's paper (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Feb., 1860) I recognize several 

 of my old species. His Gyrotoma demissa I believe to be my Schizostoma con- 

 stricta. His G. quadrata to be my S. incisa.

Appears to be this species, having the under tail coverts tipped with white, 

 and is rather larger than specimens of T. melanurus, in the Acad. Coll. Very 

 nearly allied, though, to that species.

 From Turbo. 



Two specimens labelled as females, nearly allied to T. caesius, (Cuv). and 

 T. cethiops, Sclater. 



88. Thamnophilus, 



From the River Truando. 



Several specimens, all in young plumage, probably of a species allied to 

 T. atricapillus. 



" All of the preceding five species live in the bushes, and are often to be 

 seen on the ground, and appear to subsist by capturing insects in various 

 stages, which are exceedingly abundant. All of them are more or less noisy, 

 having harsh, though not always disagreeable notes, which can constantly be 

 heard where they frequent. When alarmed, they take long flights very pre- 

 cipitately, and are not easily collected." (Mr. W. S. Wood, Jr.) 



89. Pachyrhamphus rufescens, (Spix) ? 



From Turbo. A single specimen in young plumage. 



" On the Cremantina, a high tree with very abundant foliage. Has much 

 the habits of a Fly-catcher, darting out in pursuit of insects, and returning to 

 its perch, and moving his tail in the same manner." (Mr. W. S. Wood, Jr.) 



Genus Pittasoma, nobis. 



General aspect of Conopophaga, Vieillot, but larger, and bearing about the 

 same relation to that genus as Grallaria, Vieillot, does to Grallaricula, Sclater. 

 Also resembling Pitta, Vieillot, but differing from all the genera here men- 

 tioned, except Conopophaga, in having the bill wide and depressed, not com- 

 pressed. 



Form robust, wings short, concave, rounded, fifth, sixth and seventh quills 

 longest ; tail very short ; bill strong, wide at base and narrowing gradually, 

 depressed, upper mandible notched near the tip, and with the culmen distinct, 

 a few rudimentary bristles at base ; nostrils oval, inserted in a large membrane ; 

 legs long, very strong, tarsus with about five large scales in front, which 

 become nearly integral on the outside, and quite so behind ; toes moderate ; 

 claws curved, sharp. 



90. Pittasoma Michleri, nobis. 



tf Head above black, the shafts of the feathers lustrous, large space on the 

 cheek, extending completely around the neck behind, bright chestnut, throat 

 black, many of the feathers tipped with white, and with chestnut, lores white ; 

 back reddish olive, many feathers edged with black on each side ; rump, upper 

 tail coverts and wing coverts greenish rufous, the last (wing coverts) with 

 small terminal spots of white, which spots are edged and nearly enclosed with 

 black ; under parts white, every feather having two or three rather wide, 

 transverse, waved or crescent- shaped bands of deep black; abdomen and 

 under tail coverts, tinged with ferruginous, but transversely striped with black, 

 same as other under parts of body; under wing coverts, dull greenish brown, 

 striped and spotted with white and black ; quills greenish rufous, some of the 

 shorter quills having sub-terminal spots of light rufous, edged with black ; 

 tail greenish rufous ; upper mandible dark bluish horn color, lighter towards 

 the tip ; under mandible yellow, legs light horn color. 



Total length from tip of bill to end of tail, about 7 inches, wing 3|, tail If, 

 bill from gape If, tarsus If inches. 



Hab. River Truando, New Grenada. Discovered by Mr. William S. Wood, 

 Jr. and Mr. Charles J. Wood. (Panama, Mr. J. McLeannan). Spec, in Nat. 

 Mus. Washington. 



This is the most remarkable bird in the collection of the expedition, and is 

 one of the most handsome of the Ant Thrushes, if indeed to that group it and the

genus Conopophaga belong. Though with the general form and appearance of 

 Pitta and Grallaria, this bird differs from them in having a very strong depressed 

 and rather wide bill, not compressed as in those genera. In this respect, and 

 other structural characters, it approximates to Conopophaga, and also in having 

 more variegated and agreeable colors than in Grallaria. This bird is in fact, 

 the most handsome bird of its group yet discovered in America. The only 

 specimen in the collection of the expedition is labelled as a male. 



Another and very fine specimen of this bird, kindly loaned to me by Mr. ^ 

 Lawrence, of New York, belongs to the collection of J. McLeannan, Esq., offr 

 that city, and was obtained by him on the Isthmus of Panama. 



" On the river Truando. January 22d, 1858, above its junction with the Atrato, 

 but before reaching the Cordilleras. In the woody places running on the ground 

 very swiftly, and scratching among the leaves, not common." (Mr. C. J. 

 Wood). 



This handsome bird I have named in honor of the commanding officer of the 

 expedition, Lieut. N. Michler, of the U. S. Topographical Engineers, under 

 whose direction, and with whose judicious advice and assistance, the present 

 interesting collection was made, as stated in the preliminary note to this paper.

Hab. South America, Central America. (Panama, Mr. J. G. Bell).

I have been quite unsuccessful in attempting to find a name really applicable 

 to this well marked and not uncommon species. It is usually, I believe, regard- 

 ed as Sylvia ruficapilla of authors, and is unmistakeably described by Vieillot, 

 as above cited, but erroneously so far as relates to the name, which is applied 

 by all other authors to Motacilla petechia, Linnaeus, a species not uncommon 

 from the West Indies, and accurately figured by Vieillot, Ois d'Am. Sept. pi. 

 91. Under these circumstances I propose the name above given.* 



*There are at least five species of Dendroica, resembling each other, and all having 

 the general appearance of D. cestiva of the United Slates. The first four of these have 

 been much confused and mistaken for each other :

Motacilla albicollis, Gm. Syst. Nat. ii. p. 983, (1788), 



Hab. Cuba, (Gundlach), St. Domingo, (Brisson). 



This is the bird usually regarded as D. cesliva, by the Cuban ornithologists, but is a dis- 

 tinct species as I suspected long before examining authentic specimens. The habits of 

 this bird, as given by those very accurate naturalists, are different from those of the com- 

 mon bird of the United States. Brisson (Orn. iii. p. 494) carefully describes the present 

 species, though his specimens do not appear to have been mature. The young bird only 

 has the throat and neck in front nearly pure white. 

 2. Dendroica petechia, (Linnaeus). 



Motacilla petechia, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 334, (1776). 

 Motacilla ruficapilla, Gm. Syst. JNat. ii. p. 971, (1768). 



Hab. West Indies, Central America ? Jamaica ? Martinique (Brisson). 



I have frequently seen specimens precisely in the plumage as figured by Vieillot, as 

 above cited, and by Edwards, Birds v. pi. 256, fig. 2, but I am not confident of the exact 

 locality. This is very probably the Sylvicola cesliva, of Gosse, B. of Jamaica, p. 157, 

 and probably of Messrs. Newton, B. of St. Croix, in Sclater's Ibis, 1859, p. 153. This 

 bird is also very carefully described by Brisson, (Orn. iii. p. 490), in mature plumage, with 

 the top of head, clear, well defined rufous.

Sylvia ruficapilla, Vieill. Nouv. Diet. xi. p. 228. 



Hab. South America and Central America, JNew Grenada, (W. S. Wood, Jr.) Panama,

 5. Dendroica aureola, (Gould). 



Sylvicola aureola, Gould, Voy. Beagle, Birds, p. 86, (1841). 



Hab. Galapagos Islands, (Gould). 



Very similar to D. petechia, as above. This species, or at least specimens from the 

 Galapagos Islands, I have not seen. Of all ihe others several specimens of each are now 

 before me, and 1 have not the smallest doubt of their specific distinctness, which I hope 

 to fully demonstrate in a subsequent paper. Having called the attention of my friend 

 Mr. Lawrence, of New York, >o ihe distinctness of the Cuban species, his views will 

 probably appear in his notes on Birds of Cnba, about to be published in the Annals of the 

 Lyceum, New York.

 miles of the mountains. They run on the trunks and branches very rapidly, 

 and appear to be very greedy and rapacious. Not shy, and easily approached, 

 but not easily shot, on account of their quick movements. When they have 

 ascended a tree, they fly down to the base of another, like the Brown Creeper

" The preceding seven species, and in fact nearly all the small wading birds 

 that we had been accustomed to seeing on the coast of New Jersey, were very 

 abundant on the sea coast at Carthagena, in November, 1857. The most abun- 

 dant were perhaps the two small Sandpipers (E. pusilla and T. Wilsonii), and 

 the yellow Shanks (G.flavipes). Though easily shot, they were not so easily 

 obtained, on account of the marshy or boggy character of many localities which 

 they particularly frequented. All of these species were in flocks, as seen on 

 the coast of the United States in Autumn." (Mr. W. S. Wood, Jr.)

 of small nodes on the angle ; body whorl large, mouth expanded, superior 

 sinus very deep, outer lip very much thickened, especially the extreme outer 

 portion or callosity, which is nearly as thick as long. The thickening of the 

 superior and lateral edges of the outer lip, produces a deep fosset on the poste-

 ridge angular, and extends to the margin of the shell ; anterior end rounded, 

 posterior acutely angular ; surface marked by numerous fine concentric lines 



Venus D'Orbignyanus, pi. 3, fig\ 2. Shell inequilateral, somewhat 

 convex, beaks small and inclined anteriorly, umbones large and rounded ; 

 cardinal margin curved; anterior end rounded, posterior subangular ; surface 

 marked by strong concentric lines. This species resembles, in its outline, the 

 common V. mercenaria, (M. violacea)of our coast. It differs from 

 V. Auca d'Orb. in having the cardinal margin more strongly curved, in be- 

 ing more angular posteriorly, and in not being so regularly marked on the 

 surface. 



Pinna m i n u t a, pi. 3, fig. 10. Shell small, robust, narrow ; umbonal ridge 

 subangular and nearly parallel with the cardinal line ; cardinal and basal mar- 

 gins straight ; posterior end sub-biangular ; surface marked by strong lines of 

 growth. 



Modiola cretacea, pi. 3, fig. 3. Shell small; beaks small, anterior;

SPECIAL MEETING. 



Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



The Vice President announced the object of the meeting to be to 

 express the sense of the Academy at its loss in the death of Mr. 

 George W. Carpenter, its late Treasurer, which occurred on the 7th 

 inst. On motion of Mr. Cassin, a committee consisting of Messrs. 

 Cassin, Vaux, Rand, Bridges and Jeanes, was appointed, who, after 

 a recess, presented the following resolutions, which were unanimously 

 adopted : 



Resolved, That the Academy has learned with the deepest regret of 

 the decease of our late esteemed fellow member, George W. Carpen- 

 ter, who has been associated with this Institution for a period of thirty 

 five years, and who, on account of his able and active exertions as a 

 member, and faithful discharge of the responsible duties of Treasurer, 

 during the long official term of thirty-three years, has been strictly 

 identified with, and efficiently co-operative in its progress. 



Resolved, That the members of this Academy do cordially sympa- 

 thize with the bereaved family of Mr. Carpenter, and do hereby tender 

 to them their sincere condolence. 



Resolved, That the Recording Secretary be instructed to send to 

 the family of our deceased member a copy of these resolutions, and 

 that they be published in the daily journals of this city. 



June 12th. 

 Mr. Wm. S. Vaux in the Chair. 



Forty members present. 



The following papers were presented for publication :

202 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Prof. Robert E. Rogers made some remarks on the fallacies that arose from 

 '.he ordinary use of language, when applied to the description of phenomena in 

 a scientific manner. He adverted to the subject of combustion to illustrate his 

 views, and showed that our ordinary explanation of what is called by this 

 r.ame, where one of the substances is styled a combustible, and the other a sup- 

 porter of combustion, as for example, in the burning of an ordinary gas light, 

 was fallacious, because we only looked at it from one point of view. The gas 

 to be burned was comparatively small in quantity, and the oxygen surround- 

 ing it was in large amount ; hence the gas alone appeared to burn the oxy- 

 gen of the air to support it. When, however, we surround the oxygen with a 

 large quantity of gas, or, so to speak, with an atmosphere of gas, thus reversing 

 entirely the conditions, then the oxygen burns, and the gas becomes a support- 

 er of combustion. We have then no right to call the gas a combustible any 

 more than the oxygen ; or the oxygen a supporter of combustion, any more 

 than the gas. The action between the two bodies is mutual, and the various 

 phenomena witnessed are the result of that mutual action. The Professor 

 then exhibited a beautiful experiment, in which, after first burning the com- 

 mon illuminating gas in the ordinary way, he reversed the conditions, and 

 burned a jet of common air in an atmosphere of gas.

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 



Twenty-one members present. 



The following papers were presented for publication : 



" On the identity of Ammonites Texanus, Roemer, and A. vesper- 

 tinus Morton," by Wm. M. Gabb.

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia," by George W. 

 Horn. 



And were referred to Committees.

 Mr. Lea, President, in the Chair. 

 Thirty-one members present. 



The following papers were, on the report of the Committees to which 

 they had been referred, ordered to be published in the Proceedings : 



(to the Identity of Ammonites Texanus, Koemer, and A. vespertinus, Morton. 



BY W. M. GABB. 



In 1834, Dr. Morton described, an ammonite from Arkansas, in his synopsis, 

 under the name of A. vespertinus. The type, consisting of two fragments 

 of an individual, apparently about fifteen inches in diameter, is in the collec- 

 tion of the Academy. 



As long ago as September of last year, I was struck with the resemblance 

 of these specimens to the species described by Roemer, in " Kreidebildungen 

 von Texas," 1852, under the name of A. Texanus. The originals of 

 Dr. Morton's species were so weathered that I was unable to make out the 

 septum. 



More recently, however, through the kindness of Dr. Moore, I have been 

 enabled to procure an undoubted specimen of A. Texanus, consisting of 

 nearly the whole outer whorl of an individual, about a foot in diameter. On 

 comparing this with Morton's specimens, I became convinced of their identity. 

 The names will therefore have to be A. vespertinus, Morton; A. 

 Texanus, Roemer, being a synonyme.

Penna., Canada and Mass. From Dr. Chas. Girard, Washington, D. C. 



Early in October, I found pupse of this insect at Niagara Falls, on the Ca- 

 nada side, under shelter of loosened portions of the bark of the American 

 Elm. They were enclosed in a cocoon of silk, mixed with particles of bark. 

 On the same tree I took a number of larvae which were descending the trunk 

 to undergo pupation. I did not, however, obtain imagos from any of the 

 specimens. The body was nearly uniform in diameter, with the ordinary 

 number of feet. Head as broad as the body and dark green. Body dark 

 green, between the segments yellowish and dotted with yellow ; first rings 

 with two black dots on the sides. 



N.? u lmi-arr o s o r ella . Female. Grayish-fuscous. Fore wings with 

 a slender, dark fuscous angulated line, edged on the costa internally by a pale 

 grayish spot, and on the inner margin externally by another of the same hue. 

 The subterminal line pale gray, dark margined internally. Hind wings pale 

 brownish, darker on the margin. 



The larva is found on the American elm in August. The head is pale 

 brown, dotted with dark brown. The body dark green, with a dorsal, double 

 line of pale green patches, and a slight subdorsal and stigmatal line of the 

 same hue. On the 1st, 2d, 4th, 5th and 10th rings, are brown subdorsal 

 points. It weaves a web on the surface of the leaves, feeding beneath it. 

 The pupa is contained in a web between united leaves, in the vivarium. It 

 becomes a pupa about the middle of August, and an imago about twelve or 

 fourteen days after transformation. 



Pempelia? Hiibner. 



Male. Labial palpi moderately long, scarcely exceeding the vertex ; Jirst and 

 second joints thick, third extremely short and slender. Maxillary palpi with a 

 short pencil of hairs. Tongue nearly as long as the thorax beneath: scaled at 

 base. 



P.? virgatella . Brownish luteous. Fore wings varied with pale gray- 

 ish toward the base and tip, with dull pale reddish at the base and middle of 

 inner margin ; on the middle of the costa is a blackish blotch, containing a 

 short line of the same hue, and opposite, an angulated whitish line, with few 

 black spots exterior to the costal line ; a blotch of the same hue towards the 



I860.] 




206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



base of submedian nervure, and a pale grayish subterminal line margined inter- 

 nally by a blackish line, and externally by black streaks on the nervnles. 

 The internal black margin is edged on the costa and middle of the wing with 

 pale grayish. Hinder margin spotted with black ; cilia grayish fuscous. Hind 

 wings pale brownish. 



P.? subcaesiella . Male. Pale bluish gray, dusted with fuscous. Fore 

 wings with a reddish luteous band at the base, broadest on the inner margin, 

 and a rather broad, dark fuscous band on the basal third. The subterminal 

 line is pale grayish, edged behind by dark fuscous. Hind wings pale brownish. 



Ephestia ? 



E. ostrinella . Reddish-purple varied with blackish. Fore wings with 

 the basal third and the apical portion reddish purple, with a broad blackish 

 band in the middle edged internally by a straight whitish line, and an exte- 

 rior costal patch of the same hue containing two blackish dots on a short 

 streak. The subterminal line is pale grayish. Hind wings pale brownish 

 gray. 



The larvae lives in the fruit heads of Sumack, passing the winter in the 

 larval state. It is dark reddish-brown, head brown ; cervical and terminal 

 shields blackish brown. The body is supplied with a few isolated hairs, and 

 one or two rows of obscure dark brown subdorsal dots. 



The larvae make galleries through the fruit heads, and desert them in the 

 spring, to form their cocoons, which are slight silken webs, and appear as 

 imagos about the middle of April. 



E. Zeae. Tinea Zeae, Fitch, Rept. 2d, 321. Fore wings with the basal 

 third pale ochreous-yellow or yellowish-white, and the remainder fuscous, 

 with a reddish-luteons spot on the end of the disk, or dark grayish-fuscous 

 varied with reddish luteous. 



The larvaa is a frequent inhabitant of houses, and feeds on a variety of dry 

 goods, rye, corn, clover seed, on garlic heads, preserves, especially those con- 

 tained in jars. The seeds are bound together with a silken web in which 

 galleries are left. It would be well if Dr. Fitch changed the specific name of 

 this insect as corn is by no means its favorite or usiial food. 



The labial palpi of the imago are more decidedly porrected than in the 

 foregoing species, but I do not think the difference between them is generic. 

 I have no males of Z e a e in my collection and do not know whether they have 

 the tuft beneath the fore wing. 



Lanthaphe. 



Male. The discoidal cell of the fore wings is narrow and appears to be un- 

 closed. The costal and subcostal nervures run very close to each other, if 

 not united, in the basal third of the wing ; the former, from union with the 

 first subcosto-marginal branch much thickened, or indistinctly furcate. The 

 subcostal subdivides into two branches near the basal third of the wing, the 

 upper one subdividing again in the middle of the wing, sending a branch with 

 a long fork to the costa near the tip and a simple branch to the apex. The 

 lower branch is thickened towards its origin, simple, and is the post-apical 

 nervule. The median is thickened towards its end, and is four-branched. 

 Hind wings neuration pyraliform. 



Head with ocelli. Eyes large and salient. Labial palpi ascending, applied 

 closely to the front and with the tips much elevated above the vertex ; first 

 and second joints very short, first almost rudimental ; the third very long, 

 folded longitudinally like a sheath. Maxillary palpi rather short, with a pencil 

 of very long, silky hairs, capable of being expanded, and carried concealed in 

 the sheath formed by the third joint of labial palpi. Antennae ciliated beneath; 

 basal joint thick, with a short horn-like appendage behind having a tuft of 

 hairs. Fore wings with a small discal vitreous spot, and the under surface from 



[June,

the base of the costa to the middle, thickly covered with long scales placed trans- 

 versely. 



Female. Fore wings without discal vitreous spot. Discoidal cell closed by 

 an arcuate nervure ; with costal and subcostal nervures distinct, the latter 

 with a single marginal branch from the cell, and at the apical third of the 

 wing subdividing into an apical and marginal branch, which is furcate ; the 

 subcosto post-apical from the superior angle of the cell. Submedian four 

 branched. 



With ocelli. Labial palpi ascending, with tips but little elevated above the 

 vertex ; nearly cylindrical ; second joint somewhat thickened and long*, ex- 

 tending above the eyes ; the third short, slender and pointed- Maxillary 

 short, without pencil of hairs. Antenu=ie simple and setaceous : basal joint 

 thick, without appendage behind. 



The tongue in both sexes is scaled at the base, and moderately long ; and 

 the fore wings "with distinct strigse and tufts of scales. 



This genus appears to be congeneric with Acrobasis of Zeller. 



L. platanella . Labial palpi pale brownish-red, touched in front with 

 pale gray. Head and thorax brownish-red, the latter varied with grayish and 

 dark fuscous. Fore wings grayish fuscous, with the costa touched with 

 brownish red, and a patch of the same hue in the female, near the base of the 

 inner margin containing a tuft of raised scales ; in the male, blackish brown, 

 touched with brownish red. The base of the wing is whitish. In the middle 

 of the wing is a broad white band, obsolete toward the costa, with two straight 

 blackish-brown lines internally, and in the male shaded internally with the 

 same hue. The subterminal line is irregular and whitish, dark margined 

 internally. The hinder margin of the wing is touched with blackish-brown. 

 Hind wings pale brown, somewhat darker toward the hinder margin. 



The larva? is tortriciform in appearance. Head pale brown, mottled with 

 whitish. Body with isolated hairs, pale green, with a dark brown dorsal line 

 and a fainter stigmatal line of the same hixe, or pale reddish, with a brown 

 dorsal line on each side of the vascular. 



It makes a web on the under surface of the leaf of Sycamore, (Platanus o c- 

 ciden talis), drawing it together and living within a silken tube. 



The cocoon is woven on the surface of the ground, in form of a flattened oval, 

 consisting of brown silk covered exteriorly with grains of earth. The larva- 

 remain in it unchanged during the winter. It may be taken in July, and 

 enters the pupa state during the latter part of August, to appear as an imago 

 in May or June. 



L. asperatella. Labial palpi blackish brown, varied with whitish. 

 Thorax pale grayish, varied with grayish or dark gray. Fore wings dark 

 brownish-gray, with a blackish brown tuft of scales in the basal part of the 

 fold, and a smaller one of the same hue on the disk above it, a whitish me- 

 dian band, sometimes almost obsolete, containing on the disk a small black- 

 ish-brown tuft in the female, with an internal crenated blackish line, and 

 shaded toward the base with blackish ; on its external margin is a line of 

 raised scales. The subterminal line is pale grayish, angulated and margined 

 internally by a blackish line, and externally by a fainter one produced into 

 points on the nervules. The hinder marginal line is black. Sometimes in 

 the female the base of the wing is whitish, slightly touched with luteous.

reddish-saffron, with a slight brassy hue. Along the costa are five silvery white, 

 costal streaks, all black margined internally except the first, which is very 

 oblique and continued along the costa to the base of the wing. All the costal 

 streaks are short, except the first. On the inner margin are two conspicuous 

 silvery dorsal streaks, dark margined internally, the first, very large, and placed 

 near the middle of the inner margin, the second opposite the third costal 

 streak. At the tip is a small, round black spot, placed above the middle of 

 the wing ; cilia silvery gray, tinted with saffron. Hind wings grayish-fuscous, 

 cilia paler. 



The specific name used by Dr. Fitch being already in use to designate a 

 European species of this genus, it was necessary to change it. I feel pleasure, 

 therefore, in dedicating it to the industrious observer who first described it, 

 and who is adding so much to our knowledge of entomological Natural His- 

 tory. 



L. tubiferella . Head silvery white. Antenna? fuscous, slightly annu- 

 lated with white ; basal joint pale saffron. Fore wings pale saffron, with two 

 silvery white, moderately broad bands, black margined externally, one near 

 the base and the other on the middle of the wing, and both somewhat oblique ; 

 cilia of the general hue. Hind wings dark grayish, cilia the same. 



The larva belongs to the second larval group of this genus, but the body 

 much more contracted than that of any other larva I have seen. Its form is 

 almost that of a flattened ovoid, the rings separated by deep incisions, and each 

 forming in the sides a projecting mammilla. 



The larva mines the upper surface of the leaves of oaks in September, and 

 doubtless also in the summer months. The mine is a linear tract, sometimes 

 curved or wavy, gradually increasing in breadth from the beginning to the 

 end, or as the larva increases in length, with the "frass" deposited on each 

 side of the tract and marking its outlines by two black lines. The position 

 of the larva within the mine is likewise a peculiar one, as it is always placed 

 transversely to its course, and hence the deposition of the "frass" on the 

 sides, and the gradual increase in breadth as the larva grows in length. Its 

 head is blackish brown ; the body pale greenish, with pale brown dorsal ma- 

 cula?, darker on their edges. It undergoes transformation in the end of the 

 mine, preparing a circular cell or slightly silk-lined cavity, and leaves the 

 last larval cast outside of it. The fall brood of larva become imagos about 

 the middle of May. 



L. cratfegella . This insect is found on the apple and wild cherry, (P. 

 serotina), without undergoing any variation, which I can detect. I thought 

 beyond doubt, that that in the leaf of wild cherry, must be a distinct species, 

 for the larva has a habit unusual to larvse of this group, and which I have not 

 noticed in those on the thorn and apple, although, doubtless, they correspond. 

 The habit I refer to in wild cherry miners, consists in deserting an old mine to 

 form a new one, reminding one strongly of the early habits of the Ornix larv. 

 The larva enters along the midrib to form a new mine, which I have found in 

 various stages of advancement, besides the old and tenantless mine in another 

 portion of the leaf. 



Tischeria. (See Paper No. 2.) 



T. malifoliella. Head and antennae shining dark brown ; face ochre- 

 ous. Fore wings uniform, shining dark brown with a purplish tinge, slightly 

 dusted with pale ochreous ; cilia of the general hue. Hind wings dark gray : 

 cilia with a rufous tinge. 



The larva mines the upper surface of the apple leaf. The mine is flat, at 

 least until the larva enters the pupa state, and begins as a slender white line, 

 dilating as it increases, and is ultimately formed into an irregular brownish 

 colored patch, which is sometimes extended over the beginning. This is then 

 shown on the separated epidermis as a white line or streak. The head of the 



[June,

larva is brown ; the body uniform pale green ; first segment brownish, with a 

 short, vascular greenish streak. When the pupation begins the leaf is thrown 

 into a fold, which is carpeted with silk, and the pupa lies within it. This 

 state begins about the latter part of September, and the imago appears early 

 in May. 



Antispila. (See Paper No. 3.) 



A. Isabella . Head golden. Antennae purplish brown. Fore wings pur- 

 plish brown, without violet and greenish reflections, with a pale golden band near 

 the base, inclined toward the base, not constricted on the fold, but broadest 

 on the inner margin. Near the tip of the wing is a small pale golden costal 

 spot, and one of the same hue nearly opposite on the inner margin. The 

 hind wings have a greenish reflection ; in Nysssefoliella, they are rather deep 

 purple. 



The larva mines the leaf of Isabella grape in September. Its head is brown ; 

 the body yellowish white, with a few black dorsal spots on a dark green ground, 

 on the middle segments and beneath a spot on the fourth and fifth segments : 

 first segment dark green. It cuts out a very large, nearly round disk, during 

 the latter part of September, and appears as an imago in the latter part of 

 May. 



A. viticordifoliella . The larva mines the leaves of wild grapes. Its 

 head is brown ; the body yellowish green, without dorsal or ventral spots ; 

 the first ring brown. It may be taken in August, and in the beginning of 

 September it cuts out a small oval disk and enters the pupa state. I have not 

 succeeded in breeding the imago, but have no doubt it is specifically distinct 

 from any heretofore described.

 The diagnosis of this genus was made from two specimens of A. splendorife- 

 r e 1 1 a. In insects so extremely small and fragile, even when relaxed by mois- 

 ture, it is no simple task to make a correct diagnosis from a single examina- 

 tion. The reader will therefore please correct in the January number of the 

 Proceedings as follows : Labial palpi extremely short and slender, much separated. 

 Tongue naked and scarcely as long as the anterior coxa;. 



A. lucifluella. Head silvery. Antennae rather dark fuscous. Fore 

 wings silvery from the base to the middle, and thence to the tip dark fuscous 

 varied with golden. Near the tip are three short, costal silvery streaks adjacent 

 to each other ; the first is longer than the others, with converging dark mar- 

 gins, and a golden patch on its internal side ; the second with straight dark 

 margins, and a golden patch beneath and adjoining it ; the third is unmar- 

 gined except by the external margin of the second streak which separates 

 them. Opposite the first costal streak is a dorsal, tapering streak of the same 

 hue, and placed in the dark fuscous portion of the wing. From the second 

 golden spot to the middle of the hinder margin is an oblique silvery streak, 

 sometimes separated into two spots. At the extreme apex is a deep black 

 triangular spot ; the cilia grayish, tinged with pale brownish. 



The larva may be found in September and October mining the leaves of 

 hickories. The head, first and second segments are brownish, with a reddish 

 tinge ; body brownish-green, with a dark green vascular line and three black- 

 ish dorsal spots on the middle segments. Early in October the larva cuts out 

 an oval disk and enters the pupa state, to appear as an imago early in June. 

 The perfect insect is larger than splendoriferella. 



Pakectopa. 



The fore wings are lanceolate. The disk is acutely closed behind, at the 

 apical third of the wing and narrow. No costal nervure. The subcostal sends

off quite near the base of the wing a long marginal branch, and near its end, 

 two other branches to the costa.. From the acute apex of the disk arises the 

 apical branch, which, near its origin sends a branch to the costa, and about 

 its middle becomes bifid, sending one branch to the costa near the tip, and 

 the other to the inner margin beneath it. The median is three-branched, the 

 posterior vein arising somewhat interiorly to the costal origin of the second 

 marginal, and is most distinct on the inner margin, being faintly indicated from 

 its middle to its origin. 



Hind wings very narrow, almost setiform. The disk unclosed. The costal 

 nervure is well indicated and long, reaching almost to the tip of the wing. 

 The subcostal is furcate beyond the middle of the wing and is attenuated to- 

 ward the base almost from its bifurcation ; it runs close to the costal trunk. 

 The median nervure is furcate within the middle of the wing, on the inner 

 margin. 



Head with long, loose scales above, forming a slight tuft between the an- 

 tennae. Forehead rounded. Face narrow and short, somewhat retreating and 

 smooth. No ocelli. Eyes small, round, salient and naked. Labial palpi 

 moderately long, slender, smooth, pointed and drooping, (in the living insect 

 most probably ascending) ; second joint slightly thickened at its end. Max- 

 illary palpi not perceptible. Antennae inserted on the front ; filiform and sim- 

 ple ; basal joint scarcely thicker than the stalk and short ; nearly as long as 

 the fore wings. Tongue naked, slender, nearly as long as the thorax beneath. 



P. lespedezsefoliella. Head and face white. Labial palpi, second 

 joint dark fuscous, the third white. Antenna? dark grayish fuscous. Thorax 

 blackish brown. Fore wings blackish brown, with three silvery white spots 

 along the inner margin, one almost at the base of the wing, one at the apical 

 third, and the other intermediate between them. On the costa are two silvery 

 white spots, the first a little exterior to the second dorsal ; the second costal 

 opposite the third dorsal. Along the hinder margin is a black hinder margi- 

 nal line, or two decided converging black streaks, one from the costa and the 

 other from the inner margin, meeting at the tip where there is a small silvery 

 white spot. The cilia along the hinder margin are silvery white tipped with 

 blackish, and along the inner margin dark gray. Hind wings dark fuscous, 

 cilia the same. 



The larva mines the leaves of bush-clover, (Lespedeza violacea) early in 

 September. It makes a whitish blotch mine, with a number of narrow, lat- 

 eral mines, or rather wide galleries running out from it, on the upper surface 

 of the leaf. The blotch is chiefly in the middle of the leaf, the larva mining 

 along the midrib in the first instance, and when disturbed it conceals itself 

 by retreating to the midrib, and applies itself along the course of it. Hence 

 tenanted mines may easily be mistaken for deserted ones. The mine never 

 contains " frass," and the larva seems to leave one capriciously, whilst it is 

 yet small in extent, to form a new one ; this it does by penetrating the under 

 cuticle of the leaf. In the course of larval life, many new mines are formed 

 and the insect is a troublesome one to breed. The larva is cylindrical, slightly 

 tapering from the first segment, and the body bright, concolorous green. It 

 deserts its food-plant about the middle of September to form its cocoonet ; 

 this is woven upon some substance on the ground, in the vivarium, in a pucker 

 on a leaf, or under a turned-down portion of the edge, and is white. It appears 

 as an imago early in May. 



I have no good description of this larva in my notes, but have of another 

 having precisely similar habits, and in appearance very like it. It mines a 

 species of Desmodium plants, nearly related to Lespedeza, and is probably the 

 same insect, or at least of the same genus as the above. The body of this 

 larva tapers posteriorly; it is submoniliform and slightly flattened, with the 

 segments roundly mammillated on the sides. The feet are three, the abdomi- 

 nal three and the terminal one pair. The head is pale brown ; the body 



[June,, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 211 



bright green, tinged with yellowish. The larvae desert their mines to form 

 new ones, hence they are never extensive, sometimes blotches, and again ir- 

 regular galleries along the midrib, with lateral branches. The "frass" is 

 voided at the entrance opening beneath. I was not successful in breeding the 

 larvae on Desmodium. 



Bucculatkix Zeller. 

 (See Paper No. 3, Proceedings, Jan., 1860. The authority there given is a mistake.) 



B. pomif olie 11a. Head and face very pale ochreous, with the tuft 

 tipped with brownish. Antennae pale ochreous, dotted above with dark fus- 

 cous. Fore wings whitish, tinged, with pale yellowish, freely dusted with 

 brown. On the middle of inner margin is a large dark brown, oval patch, 

 forming, with its opposite when the wings are closed, a conspicuous, nearly 

 round dorsal patch ; a streak of the same hue, from the costa opposite it, run- 

 ning to the inner angle of the wing and tapering from the costa where it is 

 broadest. At the tip is a round, dark brown apical spot, and in the cilia a 

 dark brown hinder marginal line. Hind wings pale brownish ochreous, cilia 

 the same. 



The larva feeds externally on the leaf of apple, at least at the time it was 

 taken, in the latter part of September. It is cylindrical and submoniiiform ; 

 tapers anteriorly and posteriorly ; with punctiform points and isolated hairs, 

 first segment with rather abundant dorsal hairs ; thoracic feet three, abdomi- 

 nal four and very short, terminal one pair. Head small, ellipsoidal, brown ; 

 body dark yellowish green, tinged with reddish anteriorly ; hairs blackish and 

 short. 



Early in October the larva enters the pupa state, weaving an elongated, 

 dirty white, ribbed cocoon, and appears as in imago during the latter part of 

 the following April or early in May. 



B. agnella . Head and face sordid white, the latter touched with fuscous. 

 Antennae dark fuscous. Fore wings whitish, washed with pale luteous-brown, 

 which prevails especially towards the tip and along the fold. About the 

 middle of inner margin, on the fold, is a small dark fuscous mark, consisting 

 of a few scales. The costa is dark fuscous from the base, and about the middle 

 of the wing gives off a short oblique streak of the same hue, and another 

 near the apical third, which is fuscous near the costa and pale luteous-brown 

 beyond it, and margined exteriorly with white, especially on the costa. The 

 long scales in the cilia are tipped with dark brown. Hind wings brownish, 

 cilia brownish with a rufous tinge. 



Taken on wing about the middle of May. 



Machimia. 



Fore wings with the hind margin obliquely pointed. The subcostal nervure 

 gives off a marginal branch near the basal third, and at the end of the disk 

 subdivides into four nervnles, of which the apical is furcate near the tip. 

 The median is four-branched, the medio-posterior remote from the penulti- 

 mate. The submedian is furcate at the base. In the disk is a long, faintly 

 indicated secondary cell. The neuration of the hind wings like that of De- 

 pressaria. The discal nervure is oblique. The interior basal angle rounded, 

 and the margin slightly excised behind it. 



Head and forehead between the antennae, shaggy. Face rather smooth, 

 depressed and retreating. No ocelli. Eyes small, oval and salient. Labial 

 palpi rather long, remote from the face, slender, curved and ascending ; second 

 joint roughened ivith scales; the third smooth, aciculate, and about one-third 

 less long than the second. Maxillary palpi very short. Antennae about one- 

 half as long as the fore wing, simple and filiform ; basal joint short. Tongue 

 scaled, about as long as the anterior coxae. 



I860.] 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



M. tentoriferella . Labial palpi pale yellowish ; basal half of the 

 second joint blackish or dark fuscous. Fore wings reddish ochreous, with 

 dispersed dark fuscous atoms. The extreme base of the costa is blackish, 

 from a small black spot on its edge ; with three blackish brown spots arranged 

 in a triangle in the middle of the wing, one about the middle of the disk, 

 another on its end, and one in the fold beneath them ; cilia rather long and 

 russet colored. Hind wings rufo-fuscous, along the discal portion of costa, 

 pale ochreous. 



The larva tapers posteriorly from the head ; terminal legs short, placed 

 posteriorly, projecting beyond the shield ; abdominal legs short ; with papili- 

 form points in squares, each bearing a hair ; body cylindric and sub-monili- 

 form. The head is large, carried horizontally ; somewhat flattened above, but 

 rounded ; cervical shield doubtfully indicated, its color dark green. Body 

 dark green, at first uniform, but after the last moult, a double yellowish - 

 green dorsal line is added. 



It may be found during the latter part of July, on the leaves of wild cherry, 

 oaks and hickories. On the underside of the leaf it throws a closely woven 

 sheet or web from the midrib to the side of the leaf, and draws it into a shallow 

 fold. This sheet or tent is not much longer than the larva itself, open at both 

 ends, transparent, shining and vitreous. Beneath this it rests during the 

 day, and in the night leaves it to feed on the edges of the leaf, retreating to 

 its cover if alarmed. To this it clings most tenaciously if disturbed, thrust- 

 ing its head from beneath it, shaking it from side to side, or if disturbed in 

 front, retreats, without leaving it, and defends itself stoutly with its mandi- 

 bles. Its length is about half an inch. When it leaves a leaf to form 

 a new tent on another, it always devours the silk of the one it deserts. 



During the latter part of August or first of September it enters the pupa 

 state and forms its cocoon, by turning down a portion of a leaf, carpeting it 

 with silk and binding its edges closely. The opening left at the ends, corres- 

 ponding to the tail of the pupa, is closed densely, and the other with loose 

 silken threads. The pupa case is very dark reddish brown, and it remains in 

 situ when the imago escapes. The antennae-cases as long as the wing-cases ; 

 abdomen rather short and blunt; cylindrico-conical. The imago appears 

 during the latter part of September. 



Psilocorsis. 



The neuration of the wings differs in scarcely any respect from the foregoing 

 genus, except that the medio-posterior vein is not remote from the penultimate. 

 The posterior veins of the median are very much curved. The structure of 

 the fore wings in both these groups is much like that in the Tortrices. 



Head smooth. Face rounded. Ocelli none. Eyes large, round and salient. 



Labial palpi long, remote from the face, recurved, rather slender ; second 

 joint rather flattened, smooth, with appressed scales ; third smooth, slender and 

 pointed, nearly as long as the second joint. Maxillary palpi short, distinct. 

 Antennae about one half as long as the fore wings, simple and filiform ; basal 

 joint rather long and subclavate. Tongue one-half as long as thorax beneath, 

 scaled. 



P. quercicella . Head and thorax dark yellowish-brown. Labial palpi, 

 second joint ochreous, with a black line on the edge beneath; third black, 

 with two yellowish white stripes in front. Antennae ochreous, with a black 

 line above, terminating in black spots ; basal joint with two black stripes in 

 front. Fore wings yellowish brown, varied with blackish irregular striae, 

 chiefly from the costa, with a black dot on the end of the disk. The posterior 

 margin is tipped with blackish ; the cilia are yellowish brown, containing two 

 dark fuscous hinder marginal lines. Posterior wings pale ochreous, cilia the 

 same. 



The larva tapers from the third segment anteriorly and posteriorly : flattened 



[June

above and beneath, submoniliform ; no dorsal papilliform points, but two 

 rows on the sides ; abdominal and terminal feet Very short, the latter placed 

 posteriorly. Head small, cordate, horizontal. The body is yellowish or pale 

 greenish, the head, 1st, 2d, and 3d segments black. 



It binds the leaves of oaks together, in August and September, and picks 

 out the parenchyma between the network of veins. In the latter part of Sep- 

 tember it weaves a slight cocoon between two leaves, (in nature it is probably 

 made elsewhere than between the leaves of its food plant), and becomes a ra- 

 ther short, thick pupa, with the antennae cases moniliform and longer than 

 the wing-cases, beyond the end of which they project as an obtuse spine. It 

 appears as an imago in March or April. 



Labial palpi very long and recurved, the tips extending bach as far as prothorax, 

 but remote from the face and head. 



P. re flex el la. Head brownish, tinged with ferruginous. Labial palpi 

 dark ochreous, with a black line on the edge of second joint beneath, and 

 three black lines on the third, one in front and one on each side. Antennae 

 dark ochreous, annulated with dark fuscous ; basal joint with two black stripes 

 in front. Fore wings dull ochreous, profusely dusted with reddish fuscous ; 

 cilia short and dark colored. Hind wings fuscous. 



This species very closely resembles, physically, M. tentoriferella. The 

 labial palpi are longer, however, more recurved, and the second joint perfectly 

 smooth, whilst in tentoriferella it is roughened with scales. 



Both these genera likewise closely approach the European genus Phibolocera, 

 and it is not impossible that one of them may be really identical with it, not- 

 withstanding the longer antennae and shorter third joint of the labial palpi in 

 the European species. 



Menesta. 



Fore wings obtusely pointed above the middle, elongate-ovate. Disk closed 

 by a very faint nervure. The subcostal subdivides into five nervules, the first 

 of which is from the middle of the disk, the fourth being the apical, and the 

 fifth the post apical from the middle of the disk behind. The median is three- 

 branched, the medio-posterior being opposite the third subcostal vein. The 

 fold is thickened at its end and runs into the basal third of the median. The 

 submedian curved, and shortly furcate at the base. 



Hind wings somewhat trapezoidal, slightly emarginate on the hind margin 

 beneath the tip. The discoidal cell unclosed. The costal nervure is long 

 and extended nearly to the tip. The subcostal somewhat attenuated at its 

 base, distinct from the costal, and furcate at the apical third of the wing. The 

 median three-branched, the superior and central veins on a common stalk. 



Size small. Head and face smooth, minutely scaled. Forehead and face 

 rounded and very broad. Ocelli none. Eyes vertically placed, minute, oval, 

 salient. Labial palpi smooth, slender, curved and ascending equal to the 

 vertex ; second joint slightly thickened towards its end ; third very slender, 

 pointed, and not more than one-half as long as the second. Maxillary palpi 

 very short, distinct. Antennae much separated at their base, about one-half 

 as long as the fore wings, filiform and ciliated beneath microscopically, with 

 one hair to each article ; basal joint very short, scarcely thicker than the 

 stalk. Tongue scaled at the base, slender, and about as long as the anterior 

 coxae. 



M. tortriciformella . Labial palpi fuscous, towards the base whitish. 

 Head, antennae, and face dark luteo-fuscous, the latter whitish beneath. Fore 

 wings dark brownish with a purplish hue, with a small lunate white spot on 

 the end of the disk. Hind wings dark fuscous, cilia the same. Feet pale 

 yellowish, the ends of middle and posterior tibiae touched with fuscous ; the 

 middle tarsi fuscous externally, and the hind tarsi banded with fuscous at 

 the base.

Nepticula Zeller. 



N. rubifoliella. Head dark luteous. Palpi somewhat paler luteous- 



Antennse luteous, basal joint silvery white. Fore wings blackish-brown, 

 with a rather narrow, curved silvery band about the middle of the wing. The 

 band is concave toward the base of the wing, and shows a tendency to be 

 interrupted in the middle. Cilia whitish. Hind wings grayish, cilia the 

 same. 



I have very carefully compared this insect with the description and delinea- 

 tion of N. anguli fas c iella, of Stainton, in the first volume of the Nat. 

 Hist, of the Tineina, and though unwilling to believe the fact, I cannot resist 

 the conclusion, that it is the same species. I have not named the species in 

 accordance with this conviction, because as yet I have secured but a single 

 specimen. 



The larva mines the leaf of blackberry in September. It makes a blotch 

 mine on the upper surface of the leaf, beginning as a slender gallery, extend- 

 ing quite a distance, usually along a vein of the leaf, before being enlarged 

 into a blotch. The body of the larva tapers posteriorly, the terminal rings 

 being attenuated ; color pale green, with a bright dark green vascular line ; 

 head greenish-brown and small. The larva was not taken from the mine for 

 description. It leaves the mine very early in October to spin an oval, very 

 dark reddish brown cocoon, and appears as an imago during the latter part 

 of May or early in June. There is, therefore, in all probability, a summer 

 brood, which may be found in July and August, if the conjecture is correct. 



I have no doubt that subsequent observation will prove this insect to be the 

 same as angulifasciella, and I am no little astonished to find so mi- 

 nute a creature common to the continents of Europe and America. During 

 the coming season I will endeavor to record minutely the history of the pre- 

 paratory states of the American species. 



PHALENITES. 

 Dokyodes Guenee. 



I would notice this genus here merely to express my ideas respecting its 

 classification. M. Guenee says of it, that the insects belonging to it have so 

 doubtful an aspect that he is uncertain not only in what family, but in what 

 division to place it. He notices its superficial resemblance to Crambus, or 

 Chilo, and to the genera Senta and Meliana of his division Noctuelites, but 

 says that from the form of antennae and labial palpi, the absence of ocelli, 

 (herein, however, M. Guenee is in error, for they are not absent), and from 

 some other characters, not designated, it cannot be mistaken for one of the 

 Noctuelites. While acknowledging the very notable differences between this 

 genus and those with which it is associated, he does not inform us what ruling 

 considerations induced him to prefer for it a place in his division Phalenites, 

 (Geometrina) and the family Ligidae. 



In my own view, this genus has few or no structural characteristics of the 

 Geometrina, and its neuration just as undoubtedly places it in Guenee's group 

 Noctuelites, (Noctuina); this, too, is a position justified by its general struc- 

 ture. If the subpectinated antennae of the tf, and the comparatively slender 

 body, are considerations sufficient to overrule the position of the wings in re- 

 pose, the partial folding of the hinder pair, the structure of the legs, the pre- 

 sence of ocelli, and the purely noctuiform neuration, then indeed does the 

 lesser amount of evidence overbalance the greater. Had M. Guenee not over- 

 looked the presence of ocelli, his decision might have been different, for these 

 organs are always absent in the Phalenites, and the possession of geometriform 

 antennse is not enough to neutralize their presence or to determine the place 

 of the genus. 



In the hope that some of the entomological students of New England, where 

 one of the species of this genus certainly is found, may be able to make out 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



its larval history, I will describe the species in my collection, and extract M. 

 Guenee's description of the other. The first species may be easily recognised 

 by means of Guenee's very good figure, and as a generic diagnosis would not 

 facilitate recognition, particularly without the means of reducing it from a 

 general to a special group, I will omit any generic description.

 Phalinites, Suites a Buffon, x. 233, pi. 17, f. 6. 



The appearance of the imago is somewhat crambiform. The fore wings pale 

 ochreous, tinted with dark luteous (with clear grayish violet, Gn.) along sub- 

 costal nervure and its marginal branches, and with a rather broad blackish 

 streak beneath the median nervure, extended from the base and curving be- 

 hind upwards toward the tip, bordered on the costal side by a silvery line, 

 and one of the same hue behind, along the curved portion. In the disk are 

 two blackish dots, one on the discal nervure and the other about the middle 

 of the disk. Hind wings ochreous white. Guenee's sp. from Ga.; mine from 

 Mass. Col. of Dr. Chas. Girard. 



D. s pad aria. Gn. x. p. 234. : ' Very near the preceding, but larger, 

 with the wings more oblong. The superior wings are more acute, and the 

 terminal border perfectly straight. Their color is darker, grayer, with the 

 designs finer and less distinct. The inferior are more developed and more 

 oblong ; they have the internal angle and part of the side tinted with blackish 

 gray. The abdomen is perceptibly longer, and the antennae also proportiona- 

 lly longer and slenderer." 



In his generic diagnosis, M. Guenee says of the abdomen, " ddpassant beau- 

 coup les ailes infer ieures, ' ' whereas in my specimens of a c u t a r i a , the abdomen 

 exactly equals the length of the hind wings, when the wings are folded. He 

 refers, doubtless, to the expanded wings. 



PYRALID2E. 

 Desmia Westwood. 



This is one of the few genera in M. Guenee's family Asopidae, of his division 

 Pyralites, the males in which are characterized by nodosities or curvatures of 

 the antennae. As Guenee, at the time of writing his volume on Deltoides and 

 Pyralites, had not seen the males of this genus, and his description, in the 

 general remarks on the genus, does not accurately represent their structure, 

 I will describe these organs in the male, of which I have several specimens. 

 In noticing the singular conformation of the male antenna?, he says: " sont 

 d'abord renflees en niassue, puis etranglees et munies d'un gros article ovo'ide, 

 puis enfin greles et ciliees jusqu' an sommet." 



About the middle of the antennal stalk, is placed a transverse, nearly ver- 

 tical plate, which on the external side has a triangular elevation, and adjoin- 

 ing this, toward the base, is a narrow tuft of obliquely placed scales, running 

 along the upper surface of the stalk. Toward the apex of the organ, immedi- 

 ately following this protuberance, one-half of the stalk is excised from above 

 and slightly tufted internally. There is no thickening of the stalk except at 

 the protuberance, and beneath it is microscopically pubescent from the base 

 to the tip.

 with an irregularly oval white spot placed partly on the middle of the disk,

 white spot. Abdomen with a white band at the base, a dorsal spot on the 

 middle, and a short white dorsal streak at the tip.

Eustales. 



Fore wings with two subcosto-marginal nervules, given off very near the 

 posterior-superior angle of the disk, the stalk of the second almost in contact 

 with that of the apical branch near their origins. The apical and post-apical 

 arise together at the angle of the disk, the former being furcate near the tip, 

 sending a nervulet to near the costa. The disco-central is given off from the 

 middle of the discal. Median four-branched, the medio-superior on an ex- 

 tremely short, vertical peduncle ; the posterior arising at a point somewhat 

 behind the costal origin of the first marginal branch. 



In the hind wings the costal nervure is furcate at the tip of the wing ; the 

 oblique intercostal branch is long and exterior to the cell, and the subcostal 

 simple and attenuated at the base. The median four-branched, the superior 

 which continues the curved discal nervure, almost in actual contact with the 

 following branch. The hind wings are broader than the fore wings, and about 

 one-fourth less long. 



Head with ocelli, rather remote from the eyes ; face rounded, smooth, and 

 rather narrow. Eyes large, round and prominent. Labial palpi rather thick, 

 curved and ascending to about the middle of the face ; second joint thickened 

 beneath with scales ; the third rather smooth, elongate ovoid, and about one- 

 half as long as the second. Maxillary palpi rather long, curved and ascend- 

 ing, their tips nearly equal to those of the labial palpi, roughened with scales, 

 distinctly three-jointed. Antennae about as long as the body, with triangular 

 patches of shining scales along the stalk above ; inserted above the middle of 

 the eyes, with bases contiguous and microscopically pubescent beneath. 

 Tongue scaled at base and when unrolled, does not extend beyond the tips 

 of the labial palpi. No abdominal apron (tablier) perceptible. The posterior 

 coxae rather short ; the length of the tibiae and tarsus, of the hind pair of legs, 

 equal to that of the entire body. 



E. Tedyuscongalis . Fore'wings ochreous yellow, paler along the 

 costa, dusted somewhat with reddish fuscous, with a moderately broad white 

 band from the costa near the tip, curving toward the base of the wing in the 

 submedian interspace, where it becomes rather broader, to the middle of the 

 inner margin. Behind this, near and parallel to the hind border, is a narrow 

 white band, not extended to the costa nor inner margin, and bordered exte- 

 riorly with a blackish-brown line. The exterior border of the wing is paler 

 yellow than the general hue. Hind wings white, with an oblique fuscous 

 band above the middle, tapering to the external margin ; a broad one of the 

 same hue near the hinder margin, having a pale ochreous-yellow spot at each 

 end, and margined behind with a white streak having an external delicate black 

 line. The terminal margin pale ochreous-yellow, with four black points hav- 

 ing ochreous-yellow pupils, arranged along the margin from the middle of 

 the wing toward the exterior angle.

 disk ; the apical branch, at its basal third, gives off a branch to the costa, and 

 somewhat behind its apical third becomes furcate ; the post-apical arises at 

 the angle, and the discal nervule on the costal side of the cell. Median four- 

 branched ; the superior on a very noticeable peduncle ; the posterior remote 

 from the penultimate, which together with the other branches are aggregated 

 at their bases.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 217 



In the hind wings the costal nervure has a rather long fork. The intercos- 

 tal branch exterior to the cell and extremely short, and from this point poste- 

 riorly the stalks of the two nervures are almost in contact. The median ner- 

 vure four-branched, the superior on a moderate peduncle. 



The structural differences between this and the foregoing genus are : the 

 labial palpi slenderer ; third joint very short, about one-third as long as the 

 second, which is squamous beneath. Maxillary palpi slender, smooth, por- 

 rected ; with tips equal to the end of the second joint. Tongue scaled at the 

 base, at least one-half as long as the body. The length of the middle tibiae and 

 tarsus equal to that of the body ; the hind tibiae and tarsus exceeding the 

 length of the body. 



H. ? formosalis . Fore wings pale yellow, with three white patches on 

 the disk, the two nearest the base small and slightly margined with fuscous, 

 the one on the end of the disk margined internally by an oblique fuscous line ; 

 a white patch on the nervules behind the disk, margined externally by a fus- 

 cous line convex toward the base of the wing and hooked at each end, with a 

 white patch at the tip and one beneath it at the inner angle, both margined 

 externally by a submarginal curved fuscous line. In the middle of the sub- 

 median interspace is a nearly oval white patch encircled with fuscous. Hind 

 wings white, pale yellowish beyond the middle, with a fuscous line near the 

 base from the inner margin, not extended to the costa ; a wavy double line of 

 the same hue rather external to the middle, and a white spot near the tip and 

 one about the middle of the hinder margin, both margined externally with a 

 fuscous line. On the disk is a pale yellowish spot. 



Lake Teedyuscong. Imago, July. 



Cataclysta Herrich-Schaffer. 



Fore wings with the first subcosto-marginal vein and medio-posterior oppo- 

 site at their origins. The apical vein runs into the costa before the tip, and 

 gives rise to a marginal branch at its basal and apical third. The post-api- 

 cal runs into the produced tip of the wing and gives origin to the discal ner- 

 vure. Hind wings, the costal is shortly forked near the tip. The subcostal 

 arises from the costal within the disk and is not produced toward the base. 

 The median is three-branched. Head without ocelli. Antenna? of the rj 1 densely 

 pubescent. Tongue as long as the thorax beneath. 



The structure of the posterior wings in the species described below forms 

 very nearly a parallel case to C. d i 1 u c i d a 1 i s described by M. Gueme. The 

 costal nervure ofdilucidalis is not, however, represented bifid, and the 

 branch which corresponds to the costal nervure does not arise within the cell 

 and give origin to the discal, but exterior to the disk and the discal nervure 

 arises behind it from the costal. They both concur in the absence of the dis- 

 cal, or independent nervule, and in the median being three-branched. May 

 not dilucidalisbean American species ? I cannot determine the question, 

 as M. Guenee's description is imperfect, from the fact that it was drawn from 

 badly preserved specimens. 



C. fulicalis . Fore wings white, fuscous at the costal portion of the base, 

 with a broad band near the base and a narrow wavy fuscous line crossing the 

 middle of the disk, sending from the median nervure a curved line to the in- 

 ner margin, convex exteriorly. The space between these lines is frequently 

 dusted with fuscous. From an elongated fuscous patch limited below by the 

 subcostal nervure, on the middle of the costa, departs an oblique ochreous 

 band, inclined to the inner angle and margined along the discal nervure on 

 both sides, with fuscous ; and from the posterior end of the costal patch, a 

 curved line joins the external dark margin of the band enclosing an oval spot 

 of the general hue. A subterminal band tapers to the inner angle, leaving on 

 each side of it two converging tapering bands of the general hue. Hinder 

 margin ochreous, margined internally with fuscous. Hind wings white, with

a broad fuscous band near the base, corresponding to that on the anterior, and 

 touched with ochreons in its middle ; with a median yellowish brown curved 

 line, not reaching the costa, and exterior to this, the apical half of the wing 

 is dusted slightly with dark brownish. Along the terminal margin, is a row 

 of five black lunules, connected by intermediate metallic violet-blue spots, and on 

 the extreme margin behind these latter spots, arow of orange yellow dots ; while 

 the band is tinted interiorly with the same hue, limited by an interrupted 

 slender dark brown line near the band. 



Pennsylvania, Easton. 



In ornamentation the following species is very like the foregoing. It differs 

 from it structurally in the following respects : Fore wings with the first sub- 

 oosto-marginal and medio-posterior opposite at their origins ; the second mar- 

 ginal arises at the angle of the disk ; the apical vein forked at about its middle, 

 the lower branch entering the costa before the tip. In the hind Mings the 

 costal has a long fork ; the intercostal joins the subcostal at the point of 

 departure of the discal and seems to be a continuation of it, and the subcostal 

 is continued to the base of the wing. Head with ocelli. Tongue as long a^ 

 the thorax beneath. The first joint of labial palpi thickened with scales. 



C. ? helopalis . Fore wings white, dusted with pale fuscous toward the 

 base, and on the fold behind ; with a narrow fuscous band crossing the base of 

 the disk. Near the end of the disk is a yellowish brown line, crossing the 

 wing, deeply and acutely angulated on the fold ; and near the tip are two nar- 

 row oblique streaks of the same hue converging to the inner margin above the 

 angle, the first of which is recurved toward the disk, encircling an obliquely 

 placed oval spot of the general hue on the nervules behind the disk. Alone 

 the hinder margin, near the inner angle, are a few indistinct, iridescent spots ; 

 the margin and cilia yellowish brown. Hind wings white, with a short nar- 

 row fuscous band near the base, corresponding to that on the fore Mings ; a 

 median line of the same hue, not attaining the exterior margin and the apical 

 portion of the wing exterior to it sprinkled thickly with fuscous. Hinder 

 margin with a row of black spots, having violet- blue metallic pupils and tint- 

 ed with pale orange between the spots. 



Lake Teedyuscong. 



Sikonia. 



In the fore wings two distinct subcosto-marginal nervules leave the disk, 

 the first and the medio-posterior opposite ; the second marginal arising at a 

 point nearly intermediate between the two hinder branches of the median ; 

 the apical vein is forked a little beyond its middle ; the post apical and disco- 

 central arise near each other on the costal side of the wing. The median is 

 four-branched. In the hind wings the intercostal is short, remote from and 

 exterior to the upper angle of the disk. There is nothing characteristic in the 

 shape of the wings ; the posterior are broader than the anterior. 



Head with ocelli. Antennae pubescent beneath. Labial palpi, when un- 

 denuded, moderately thick and squamose beneath, ascending to the middle of 

 the front ; third joint short and rather smooth ; denuded; tapering to the tip 

 from the base, slender and cylindrical ; the basal joint long, equal to the front : 

 the second and third short and equal in length. Maxillary palpi two-jointed, 

 with tips nearly equal to those of the labial, ascending and somewhat 

 tufted at the end. Tongue scaled at base, exceeding the labial palpi by one 

 half its length. No abdominal apron peceptib!e ; the length of the posterior 

 tarsus and the tibia equal to that of the body. 



S. maculalis. Fore wings white, dusted with fuscous along the base 

 of submedian nervure ; with a fuscous spot at the base of the fold and one of 

 the same hue in the middle of submedian interspace, and a broad, irregular 

 band adjoining the disk behind, extended from the costa to the inner angle, 

 with the exterior half nearly square, and the interior somewhat paler, curved

and tapering. The apex of the wing is touched with fuscous, and the ends of 

 the nervules slightly dotted with the same hue. Hind wings concolorous, 

 pure white.

Before concluding this paper, I desire to record my views respecting the 

 unnecessary amount of labor, loss of time and uninviting study, which the 

 details of M. Guenee's mode of systemization imposes on the American stu- 

 dent. MM. Boisduval and Guenee, in the important and comprehensive works 

 which engage their labors at the present time, are not writing treatises on 

 local faunae, but on that of the entire world, in so far at least as lepidopterous 

 insects are known ; and students everywhere have a right to expect that 

 the difficulties of classification will be diminished, rather than complicated, 

 by their treatment of the various groups which may be included in their 

 works. The author who would be cosmopolitan in his representation of this 

 subject, at the present day, cannot neglect, in justice to those who may fol- 

 low his footsteps through nature, to endeavor to lighten their burden of study 

 and to economize their time, by leading them with all the lights of his know- 

 ledge, through the complicated mazes of doubt, engendered by the numerous 

 and perplexing affinities existing in beings of the animated world. The chief 

 object of classification is simply to communicate our own systematic concep- 

 tions to others, and to mark the graduations in the arrangement in such a 

 manner, as will enable them easily and quickly to recognize its groups. How 

 has M. Guenee facilitated the recognition of genera, whilst he has greatly in- 

 creased the number of them, or lightened in any respect the systematic labor 

 of the foreign student ? Is it enough that he should content himself with 

 carefully written diagnoses, and compel the student to examine critically 

 and minutely every one in any of his family groups, before being able to 

 decide whether the insect he may wish to classify belongs to any of them, or 

 is not edited ? A system which both reason and convenience approves, is 

 that which enables the student easily to find what he seeks, and not that 

 which compels him to master the genera peculiar to every other portion of 

 the globe, in order to assure himself whether a group has been established 

 into which his specimens can be admitted. 



The omission of synopses of genera, when the number of them in his family 

 groups calls for such tables, as it does so frequently, is a most serious, not to 

 say unpardonable, defect in the six volumes published by M. Guenpe. There 

 is no student of American lepidopterology, compelled to study his works, who 

 will not regret that he has so extensively described our fauna ; and the fact 

 that so much time and patience and labor are necessary to determine whether 

 a generic description is given by the author, of one of our moths, of which 

 everything is unknown, perhaps, except the division to which it belongs in his 

 system, is an actual and real impediment to the development of the study in 

 our country. In the examination and comparison of lepidopterous insects, 

 M. Guenee recognizes beyond doubt, each genus under a family by some dis- 

 tinctive structural trait, and why cannot all these be presented to the student 

 in synopses, as well as they are apparent to his own perceptive faculties ? 

 Without these conveniences of comparative study, the student is compelled 

 to do the work of the author anew, and, at an immense disadvantage and loss 

 of time, to search for what is distinctive, in by no means sharply, though dif- 

 fusely characterized groups, which include very frequently ornamentation 

 as one of their chief characteristics. In the cabinet of specimens, all this is 

 almost apparent at a glance, and it is the result of this educated sense that 

 seizes quickly what is distinctive in a variety of forms, that the student has a 

 right to look for in synopses. 



M. Guenee expressly declares in one of his early works in the "Suites a 

 Buffon," that in giving the meagre synopses of tribes and families, contained in 

 the series, he is merely following the custom of M. Boisduval, and that lie

220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



does not consider them of any value in a natural system. It seems strange 

 that any one, especially M. Guenee, could entertain such an opinion, when a 

 slight amount of study is sufficient to convince any naturalist, that there is 

 no severer test to be applied to a system than the construction of synopses 

 containing exclusive categories founded on structure. Groups agreeing most 

 closely are brought into direct contrast, and if the most trivial and unimpor- 

 tant structural peculiarities, except in the case of genera, are called into 

 "requisition to distinguish them, whatever may be their comprehensiveness, is 

 not the fact very strongly suggestive of want of naturalness, nay, of purely 

 artificial, arbitrary distinctions, produced by the desire to create differences 

 where there are none actually in nature ? But even admitting they are 

 formed on a purely artificial basis, and that all synopses are essentially artifi- 

 cial, need the fact in the character of a simple index to systematic concep- 

 tions, in any manner affect the most natural arrangement of the group in the 

 text ? And could there be any better system than that which unites the 

 convenience of the one to the truthfulness of the other ? 



One of the chief objects in systematic and descriptive works certainly ought 

 to be, a ready and certain recognition of groups and individuals ; and to facili- 

 tate this, no care or labor bestowed on synopses intended to promote this 

 object and prevent loss of time to the inquirer, can be regarded as superfluous 

 or as a tax on authorship. The world is thus the gainer in economy of time, 

 and science is more rapidly advanced. And surely, when one reflects how few 

 there are who devote themselves to scientific study, the additional labor thus 

 expended by the author carries into the future the most fruitful results. It 

 is the neglect of the synoptical system that has converted, even at the present 

 day, the great majority of entomologists everywhere into a class of mere col- 

 lectors and picture-recognizers, and which calls for a profuseness of illustra- 

 tion to be met with in no other department of Natural History. And on the 

 other hand, its tendency is to institute, if indeed it has not already done so, 

 an Egyptian priesthood over nature, in that body of European " authorities" 

 skilled in the interpretation of its hieroglyphics, and who furnish students 

 with a complicated, skeleton method, all of whose details they must painfully 

 acquire, before they can in the humblest degree, aspire to question systematic 

 nature for themselves. How laborious, time consuming and discouraging 

 this is to the American student, who has "no authority" to consult, save the 

 ambiguous phrases of diagnoses, no classified collections to study, and by 

 the comparison of forms to educate his perceptive powers in generic and family 

 differences, cannot be appreciated by those who have all these aids, and who 

 are the heirs to almost hereditary entomological lore and collections, handed 

 down from one generation to another. 



The times, however, demand of MM. Guenee and Boisduval a system of con- 

 venient study. The former, it is true, attempts to meet this demand by 

 separating the portion of the order of which he treats, first, into divisions, and 

 these into tribes, and these again into families ; but scattered as they are 

 through the body of the work, or through several volumes, this complication 

 of arrangement is far from fulfilling the needs of the student. It is not 

 natural, and is therefore perplexing, and has caused the author to mistake 

 well marked groups within families, for families themselves, or even higher 

 divisions. When the individual structure of two beings placed in different, 

 sometimes widely separated families, approach so intimately that they can be 

 distinguished only by resort to trivial characters, what more conclusive proof 

 of artificiality, and mere brain and paper-created distinctions, can the natu- 

 ralist desire ? 



The elaborate description of groups is a highly commendable trait in a sys- 

 tematic work. They should be, however, merely a confirmation of the results 

 attainable by the study of synopses of characters, all the categories of which 

 are rigidly exclusive and markedly characteristic ot the groups they desig- 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 221 



nate. By this means, the question of groups having heen reduced to a few 

 which are most closely coincident, doubts which cannot be dispelled by the 

 best synopses, are either confirmed or dissipated at once. This subject I 

 think eminently worthy M. Ghienee's consideration, and that of all systema- 

 tists who may succeed him. I would beg him to think upon it in connection 

 with his subsequent works, and at least tell students why he values less a 

 solid and self-satisfying reputation, built on essential and successful impetus 

 given to his favorite branch of study in all parts of the civilized world, than that 

 ephemeral position of being the temporary authority for the little entomologi- 

 cal world ; and if in addition to synopses of all bis groups, under the next 

 most general in value, he would add to his works delineations of the dis- 

 tinctive parts of structure in every genus, instead of colored representations of 

 a few moths, his works would possess an enduring and permanent value, so 

 long as entomology as a study engages the attention of the student of nature. 



Homiptera of the North Pacific Exploring Expedition under Com'rs Kodgers 



and Ringgold. 



BY P, R. UHLER. 



The Hemipterous insects, brought home by the Expedition, furnish several 

 new and remarkable species, and much praise is due the indefatigable botanist 

 of this Expedition, Mr. Charles Wright, for displaying such zeal in bringing 

 together so many interesting objects. The insect fauna of many of the countries 

 touched at, particularly that of Japan, being almost entirely unknown, renders 

 every addition of species from those localities exceedingly desirable, and it 

 would be matter of deep interest to have an opportunity of examining full 

 series of them. 



Considering the importance of the species procured, it is much to be regretted 

 that extensive facilities were not afforded for bringing together a general col- 

 lection ; but, under the existence of contingent circumstances, this was not 

 possible. 



The absence of any extensive collection of exotic Hemiplera in this country 

 renders it impossible to decide with precision upon a few of the species here 

 included ; but should they hereafter be found to have been previously charac- 

 terized, the proper acknowledgments will be made. As there seems to be no 

 settled opinion in the minds of Entomologists respecting certain groups, par- 

 ticularly with such families as Halydce, Pentatomidce, Rliaphigastridce, &c, and 

 still further on, with Mictidce, Nematopidce, Acanthocoridce, &c, and having met 

 with a genus (Pachycephalus) which violates the characters of the families 

 given, I thought it better to place the included species in two large groups 

 (Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea), corresponding with the genera Pentatoma and Coreus, 

 of Fabricius.

This insect, owing to the length of the last joint of the antennae and the 

 absence of the sternal groove, does not completely agree with the genus as 

 characterized by Amyot ; but its general affinities seem to cause it to recur to 

 this genus, where we have accordingly placed it.

This genus presents an entire anomaly among3t the Coreoid Hemiptera with 

 simple legs ; it seems to have most affinity with the Gonoceridse, but it differs 

 from them in the length of the hemelytra and the irregularity of its nervules ; 

 its position in the series, as the system now stands, is very difficult to define.

Nothing is said of the antennae, as they are unfortunately broken off from 

 the only specimen obtained. 



A specimen, which I take to be a variety of this species, was captured at the 

 Cape of Good Hope. 



It differs from the type in having the posterior thoracic lobe tnarmorated 

 with testaceous, the hemelytral spot is not so black, spreading more irregularly 

 over the surface, the testaceous color is faintly spread over the margins of the 

 tergum, the femora? are testaceous for two-thirds of their basal length, the 

 tibia and tarsi are almost entirely testaceous, and the rostrum is tinged with 

 piceous, more or less deep, throughout its entire length. Its length is 10J mil- 

 lim. 9. 



It corresponds with what is considered as a not full colored state of many 

 insects of this and other families of Hemiptera, wherein the insect has not 

 lived long enough to attain its complete depth of coloring, or where certain 

 physical contingencies have retarded its attainment to full perfection of color.

Notes on Shells, 

 BY T. A. CONRAD. 



In "Tertiary Fossil Shells of the United States," I characterized a genus of 

 Carditidce, published in 1838, under the name of Carditamera, which ha? 

 generally been referred to the genus Mytilicardia of Blainville. The two 

 genera differ so much in external form, that they can easily be recognized 

 without reference to the hinge. The former has the general form of an elonga- 

 ted Arca, Lam., whilst the latter has an outline somewhat like that of Modiola. 

 The genus Carditamera, Dr. Gray has since named Lazaria, the reason for the 

 change of name being unknown to me. 



In this country the genus Carditamera, originated in the Miocene perio'i. 

 which contains three known species, and there is one living, which inhabits the 

 coast of Florida. One is said to inhabit Madagascar, and all the others are 

 American. It does not appear that any species of Mytilicardia, is American, 

 either recent or fossil. The type of Carditamera is Cardita pectunculus, Brug.

PLEIODON, Conrad. 



The discovery of a new species of this African genns in Lake Tanganyika 

 suggests the probability that Pleiodon will prove the predominant form of 

 Unionidae in tropical Africa, and we may anticipate the discovery of many 

 species by future explorers. It occupies in geographical distribution as impor- 

 tant a position as Castalia and Triquetra do in tropical South America. I 

 presume from the peculiar and distinct character of the hinge of Pleiodon, 

 that the animal will be found somewhat different in organization from those of 

 other genera of Unionidaj. It will be interesting to learn whether this form is 

 accompanied or not by species of the nearest allied genus Mutela, at present 

 known only to exist in the Nile. 



PARAMYA, Conrad. 



I propose the above name as a substitute for Myalina, Conrad, figured and 

 described in " Foss. of Medial Tert. of the U. S." p. 65, pi. 36, fig. 4. A very 

 different genus was designated Myalina, by De Koninck, and has priority.

L. cl av a t a. Polypary bipinnate. Trunk and branches very much flat- 

 tened. Branchlets thick, and but slightly compressed, clavate at their ex- 

 tremities. Calices numerous and projecting. Coenenchyme thick. Color 

 reddish-pink. 



This species differs from the L. 11 a m m e a , in its more numerous aud pro- 

 jecting calices. The branchlets of the latter are much flattened and acumi- 

 nate, and have an intense red color. 



Locality unknown. 



L. aurantiaca . Polypary very much subdivided. Trunk but slightly 

 flattened. Branchlets numerous and rounded, arising in pairs from opposite 

 sides of the branches. Calices numerous and slightly elevated. Coenenchyme 

 thin. Color orange, striped with red. 



This species is much more subdivided than either of the others, and has its 

 trunk and branches much less flattened. The color of the trunk, deprived of 

 the cortex, is red. 



Locality unknown. 



Rhipidigorgia. 



R. Engelmanni . Flabellate, coarsely reticulate. Branches much flat- 

 tened, from one to two and a half lines wide. Interspaces rounded, occasion- 

 ally elongated to the extent of one inch. Color ochreous externally, purple 

 or reddish within. 



The fronds of this species are higher than wide, (height 9 inches, width 6 

 inches,) bearing no free branchlets. Calices large and crowded, quadrangular 

 in outline, with no elevation of their edges. Coenenchyme thick, easily 

 crushed.

These ants have homes in the ground. A few of their underground dwellings 

 have lately been brought to view, by digging, in order to kill the ants, because 

 they destroy what belongs to the farmer and horticulturist. The extent of 

 these ant galleries and cells, is so' great as almost to exceed belief; but several 

 of the excavations made to slay ants are within the incorporated limits of the 

 city of Austin, and have been seen by hundreds of its citizens. The under- 

 ground rooms of these cutting ants are rounded or oblong cavities, all con- 

 nected by cylindrical passages, of a diameter varying from one to three or even 

 more inches. Some cells are six inches wide, by nearly as many in height, and 

 others twelve inches high, with a shorter diameter of some six to eighteen inche.s 

 and the longer diameter three feet, and sometimes even more. These chambers 

 are often one above the other, and again side by side ; but on the whole, they 

 do not seem to be placed with any apparent order, being scattered under- 

 ground at various distances apart, from two inches to as many feet. In a 

 clay soil they appear to be coated or varnished with a very thin, dirty brown, 

 waxlike secretion. In sandy ground, to keep the walls firm, they are plastered 

 with a black limestone earth, abounding in portions of the prairies and river 

 bottoms. This often has to be carried a distance of many rods ; and then the 

 amount of their labor and its results are truly wonderful, showing their know- 

 ledge to be equal to that of any race of ants known. Their lowest chambers 

 are generally ten and twelve feet deep, while the upper cells are rarely nearer 

 the surface than eighteen inches, I extended a tape line down to the bottom of 

 one, and found it seventeen feet deep; at one of their largest dens, a room was 

 found sixteen feet beneath the surface, and several others were at near the 

 same depth. At that place, the ground is dug out from twelve to sixteen feet 

 deep, extending over an arta having an average diameter of twenty-five feet, 

 all of which was filled with ant cells. Several large avenues (4 5 in. diam.) 

 entered the bottom of this large den. On striking an avenue, some ants were 

 seen to enter it followed by others, loaded with barley, all coming from that 

 underground passage. Where they got the barley was the question, which 

 was finally solved by going to a stable more than three hundred feet distant ; 

 from which ants were seen to descend, each with his barley grain, and enter a 

 hole in the ground near the base of the stable, which was the only place in the 

 vicinitv where there was any barley. Another avenue on the other side, is 

 said to come out at the bank of a stream, between two and three hundred feet 

 distant, where are some elm trees, from which the ants obtained bits of leaves, 

 and carried them through said avenue into the base of the den. That they 

 have extensive underground passages, there is not the least doubt. A gentle- 

 man recently told me of an instance where they dug under or tunneled a 

 stream to get into a garden. There was a large ant den across the stream, and 

 for a long time the garden was safe from their depredations, but finally the 

 cutting ants were seen there, carrying bits of leaves into a small hole in the 

 ground. There was no ant den in the vicinity, except the one across the creek, 

 and as there were no dirt heaps on the surface of the ground in the garden, as 

 there always are above an ant den, the inference was, that those cutting ants 

 seen in the garden belonged to the tribe across the river; if so, it is probable 

 that some of their wise ones, when on the trees in the vicinity of their abode, 

 beheld the fine things in the garden, to obtain which they advised tunneling 

 the stream. 



The question will naturally arise, how is it possible for them to direct their 

 course in digging those long underground passages so as to reach the surface 

 at the wished for spot ? Let those who ask, also answer ; I only know that 

 such long avenues exist, having thrust a long stick into one at the bottom of 

 one of their dens, and I have also seen the outer openings of many of them on

the banks of rivers and streams, whose water gives the ants drink, and where 

 food can easily be had from the trees and bushes usually found growing on the 

 banks of streams in all prairie lands. 



At the large ant den in Austin, before spoken of, millions of working ants, 

 and bushels of eggs and larva?, with great numbers of males and females, were 

 destroyed. As soon as a large apartment containing the eggs, larva? and 

 winged ants was found, a fire was kindled forthwith among them, for which pur- 

 pose, light, combustible stuff was kept near. The eggs were of different sizes, 

 belonging to opposite sexes, also showing, probably, that they grow, and were 

 in a greater or less advanced stage of development. The workers at first are 

 very small, scarcely a line in length. The eggs mixed with minute young ants, 

 were in a soft, grey spongy substance, apparently leaves, finely triturated and 

 mixed with an animal secretion. 



It is said they sometimes abandon their caves, when from long residence the 

 chambers become filthy, or perhaps they are injured by heavy rains, or it may 

 be that the ants desire a better situation for provender. Whatever may be the 

 cause, they have been known to emigrate en masse, and after making new ex- 

 cavations, and dwelling in them a few years, to return again to their old first 

 residence. It is probable that they have a division of labor, some nurse the 

 young, and others provide food. In one instance I saw one cut off a segment 

 of an elm leaf, and another seized it as soon as cut, and carried it away, but 

 generally I have noticed that he who cuts also carries. When cutting, one 

 mandible is inserted, and carried slowly along; the head swaying to and fro, 

 and the other mandible moving its sharp point, apparently breaking the surface 

 to lessen the thickness to be cut by the other. The ant often stands on the 

 part of the leaf which he is cutting off, but he is careful to remove to a firm 

 place before it is finally severed, which done, he seizes one edge of it with his 

 mandibles, and with a rapid movement throws it on his head and thorax, so 

 that its lower edge rests between the lobes of the head and the spines of the 

 thorax, and the upper edge is aloft. Away he goes, and joins the busy throng 

 in the main path, which looks as if the ants had a gala day, and were march- 

 ing with banners flying. Lately, on the banks of the Colorado river, near 

 Austin, I saw multitudes of ants in their path, going up hill with fragments of 

 leaves, and hack berries, (celtis,) some entire, and others with a small portion 

 cut off, to render them lighter and suitable to be carried by the smaller ants. 

 The place at which they entered the ground was about six feet from the top of 

 the bank. This pathway was steep, and even perpendicular, for a distance of 

 five or six inches, at a place about one foot below their doorway. The labor 

 was severe to carry the berries up this path, but the struggle was great to 

 get them to the top of the perpendicular spot. In performing this feat the 

 berry carriers met with many falls, often rolling one and two feet down the hill 

 but always sticking fast to their burdens, and trying again until they finally 

 triumphed. One fell when near the top, and as he came up again, and was 

 about to succeed, I touched his load with the point of a knife, and down it 

 and ant went. His third attempt was put to the same test, but even then, he 

 did not get angry, or show the least impatience, but cheerfully took his berry, 

 and went up and in at the door of the long avenue. 



A lady lately showed me a safe where she kept sugar and sweetmeats, which 

 drew swarms of small ants. The legs of the safe were then placed in vessels of 

 water, and the ants did not succeed in reaching the sweets during several days, 

 but finally many of them were found in the sugar. After some little study to 

 discover how they got there, they were seen to drop on the safe from the roof 

 at the distance of about two feet above. These, however, were not the cutting 

 ants, and I only mention their feats because they are similar to those related 

 of ants by an East India officer. A gentleman told me that he suspended 

 sugar by a string from a rafter in his house, to keep it from ants, but they went 

 up and came down the string. They also were not the cutting ants, which 

 rarely, if ever, enter houses.

236 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



The cutting ants often assist each other. I saw one which fell with a hack 

 berry, at the vertical place before named. The berry got loose from him, and 

 instead of shouldering it again, he tried to drag it along, but was unable to 

 pull it up the perpendicular. Many passed him and gave the cold shoulder ; 

 finally a kind ant came and pushed. By shoving and pulling the two succeeded 

 in getting the berry to the top, when the assister immediately left, and started 

 down the hill. They live on both animal and vegetable [food. I have seen 

 them carrying both worms and bugs. Whole beetles and numerous elytra 

 have been found in their cells, but nothing indicating that they lay up large 

 stores of food, like some of the East India ants, which have been seen to fetch 

 their stores of corn to the surface to dry after heavy rains. The common 

 tumble bug, (Canthon lesvis,) in rolling his ball, sometimes heedlessly backs up 

 over a nest of the cutting ants, and falls a victim, being overcome by numbers. 

 Once I saw a very large one roll his ball into their midst, when he was fiercely 

 attacked by the multitude. At first he stuck his nose in the sand, or rather 

 between his forelegs, but the bites behind were so severe that he roused and 

 flew in circles, finally alighting near me, which was no sooner done than an 

 ant who had accompanied the flight, jumped to the ground, for a moment 

 looked bewildered, then ran for home, it may be, to tell of his wonderful ride on 

 the big bug. 



The damage which these ants do, is great, by destroying trees and vegeta- 

 bles. I know of one family who are about to leave a beautiful situation near a 

 fine spring, because the cutting ants have nearly killed their fruit trees and 

 ornamental shrubbery, especially roses, for which they have a peculiar fond- 

 ness. They have been known to strip a fruit tree of its leaves in a single 

 night. In some sections these ants prevent the cultivation of fruit. Thou- 

 sands of dollars have been uselessly spent in attempts to kill them by blowing 

 noxious gasses into their dens, or by placing poisons at the doorways of their 

 dwellings. A knowledge of the habits and abodes of these insects show the 

 futility of such attempts ; the fact is, but few of these can be reached by gas, 

 let the bellows blow ever so hard, nor can many be killed by poison, even if 

 the most deadly be placed within their doorways, for as soon as they discover 

 harm, they form a new entrance. The only effectual method of destroying 

 them is to dig, and kill the females and young, when the neuters will soon 

 perish. This is so expensive that it will only be resorted to near a garden or 

 dwelling, and as the cutting ants are scattered through western and central 

 Texas, they probably never will be exterminated by man.

If this is a distinct species (which is doubtful) it must retain the specific 

 name of the first author. 



Sigillaria Brongt. 



Stem not articulate, corticate, costate, smooth or striate; ribs of various 

 widths, having furrows interposed between them ; cicatrices discoid, disposed 

 spirally upon the ribs, their longitudinal diameter exceeding the transverse ; 

 vascular scars varying in number, mostly linear. 



The great fossil botanist, Brongniart, united the three genera of Sternberg, 

 (Rhytidolepis, Favularia and Syringodendron,) with the title of Sigillaria. 

 More modern authors have, however, reseparated them, retaining Brongniart's 

 name for the first division of Sternb. 



Among recent writers, Messrs. Lindley and Hutton, have acknowledged the 

 genus Favularia, but Unger, Lesquereux and others do not. We have not 

 seen sufficient specimens of this genus to justify us in offering an opinion. 



Rhytidolepis, has, we believe, the right of priority over Sigillaria, but as the 

 latter is now universally employed, it would cause too much confusion to re- 

 vert to the original title. 



M. Bronguiart says, (see top of page 393, Veg. Foss.) " this genus is charac- 

 terized by the longitudinal diameter of scars at least equalling the transverse, 

 and that ordinarily it is much greater." A very few of the species which we 

 would recognise as true Sigillaria, depart slightly from this rule, but it is im- 

 possible to characterize a genus in fossil botany, some of whose forms will not 

 approach those of another division, for the simple reason, that any classifica- 

 tion, however ingenious, must necessarily be purely artificial. 



According to the oldest classification, all fossil plants were referred to the 

 two genera, Filicites and Phytolithus. The present system has arisen by 

 splitting off", as it were, section after section from these. 



The classification of vegetable reliquse may thus continue to advance, and it 

 is with the hope it may prove a step in the right direction, that we propose 

 a partial revision of the genus Sigillaria. 



S. perplexa, n. sp. Stem costate, costa varying in their width; bark 

 thin ; cicatrices quadrangular, conjoined by their raised confluent borders ; 

 vascular scars obsolete. 



We place this very remarkable fossil in this group until better specimens 

 can be obtained for further stud)'. Though the vascular scars are not pre- 

 served, yet we cannot say they have never existed. When the bark is stript 

 from the stem, a raised border is seen to underlie the margin of external scar. 

 Locality and position unknown. Cabinet of the Academy. 



S. solan us, n. sp. Stem costate ; ribs strongly convex, striate, and with 

 a striate groove in the middle; cicatrices placed in this groove, small, distant 

 subdiscoidal, often elongated with iheir base rounded and apex somewhat 

 truncate ; vascular scars three, those on the sides linear, arcuate. 



In our specimen the distance between the scars is about five times their 

 length. The depression or channel is slightly widened at their position, and 

 between them a band, equalling them in width, is finely chased by very numer- 

 ous minute striae. Locality, Shaever's Drift, East Norwegia. Position unknown.

We think the absence of ribs is sufficient to found a generic distinction on, 

 but this genus is also separated from Sigillaria, by the excess of the transverse 

 over the longitudinal diameter of the leaf-scar. 



A. camptotaenia, n. sp. Stem striate ; striae disposed in two series; 

 in the one, contiguous, numerous, descending towards the right; in the other, 

 few, and ascending towards the right; cicatrices sub-triangular rounded at apex, 

 acuminate at the base ; vascular scars almost obsolete. Locality and position 

 unknown. Cabinet of the Academy. 



A. ornitliicnoides, n. sp. Stem longitudinally striate, vascular cica- 

 trices three, linear, the middle much the longest. 



This is undoubtedly decorticated and the markings are often obscured by 

 adherent flakes of coal ; but the peculiar disposition of the scars render this 

 species very distinct. The middle impression projecting in front and behind 

 gives the scars an appearance resembling that of bird tracks,which is often height- 

 ened by short curved strias projecting from the side marks. Near the top and 

 bottom of the specimen are two large oval scars, which, perhaps, mark the 

 former position of branches; if so, this further separates this genus from Sigil- 

 laria, which Brongt. says do not branch. Locality, Milnes Mine, St. Clair. 

 Position unknown. Collection of the Academy. 



Syringodendron Sternb. 



Stem tree-like furrowed, costate ; cicatrices either single or double ; vascu- 

 lar scars for the most part wanting, but sometimes represented by a single 

 dot. 



This is a very poorly defined genus, and we think that at some future date it 

 will be broken up into several. We have seen no vascular scar in any speci- 

 men, and think that species possessing such will be found to have other char- 

 acters in common sufficient to warrant their erection into a distinct genus. 



For the present we follow Sternberg in dividing into two sub-genera a, 

 those with a single scar ; b, those with a double scar. 



S. m a g n i f i c a, n. sp. Stem not costate ; striate (when decorticated), bark 

 . very seldom preserved ; cicatrices double, oval, arranged in spiral, undulating 

 rows ten to fifteen lines apart. 



The distance between the pairs of scars is very variable, but never, in our 

 specimens, exceeding twice their length. The two scars are often fused into 

 one, with a broad disk of coal adherent. This species is seldom found with 

 the bark remaining, we have seen but a single very poor specimen of it in that 

 state. Owing to the absence of ribs, we think that it should not be classed in 

 this genus. But desiring to avoid creating genera unueccessarily, we place it 

 provisionally here. If other similar species should be found, constituting a 

 distinct group, we would propose the name of* Diplotaxis. 



Solenocla nobis. 



Stem ribbed, costre narrow, convex; furrows equalling in width the ribs; 

 cicatrices round, situated in the furrows between the ribs; vascular scars un- 

 known. 



We have created this genus to receive a very curious fossil from Schuylkill 

 Co., Pa. Although the specimen is large and very handsome, yet the cortex 

 is not sufficiently preserved, for us to note the form or even existence of vascu- 

 lar scars. 



S. psilophloeus, n. sp. Stem costata, costa convex, furrows and ribs 

 striate, bark thin, cicatices convex, situate in middle of the furrows. Locality,

with apex and base acuminate ; margin sunken, flexuous, very narrow ; vascu- 

 lar scars lanceolate. 



In our specimen the vascular scars are almost obsolete and have a slight 

 bulbous enlargement in the centre. Where the bark remains, the crest of the 

 scar alone reaches the surface. We place this plant, with some hesitation, among 

 the Lepidodendra. It is, however, allied to L. rimosum and L. undu la- 

 tum, and with them ought perhaps to be erected into a separate genus. If 

 this should hi found advisable, we would propose the name Acrostigma. Lo- 

 cality and position uaknown. Collection of the Academy. 



L. in gens n. sp. Cicatrices sub-rhomboidal, with apex and base acumi- 

 nate, and base curved ; margin distinct, furrowed, regularly flexuous ; vascu- 

 lar scar sub-triangular, rounded at its apex, with the angles acute ; tubercles 

 distinct obovate ; middle line almost obsolete, its situation marked by a shal- 

 low groove. 



This large species, somewhat resembles L. giganteum Lesq. from which, 

 however, the outline and disposition of leaf-scars separate it. 



L. m e k i s t o n, n. sp. Cicatrices, elongate with both apex and base acumi-

 sub-rhomboidal, with acute angles and marked with two or three dots ; ap- 

 pendices distinct, very long, tubercles obovate ; medial line deeply furrowed, 

 transversely rugose. 



The internal markings, of cicatriculi as well as the tubercles, are very often 

 badly preserved. The general form of main scar resembles L. Lindleyanum 

 Ung., whilst the raised border and form of vascular scars ally the plant to 

 L. aculeatum Sternb. The more elongated cicatrix and the acute angles 

 of the cicatriculi, separate it from the latter species. It also differs in the 

 situation of tubercles and length of appendices. Locality and position un- 

 known. Cabinet of the Academy. 



L. w e n i, n. sp. Cicatrices rhomboidal with somewhat curved base and

 L. aculeatum Sternb. we think is shown by the following considerations : 

 1st. The shape and relative position of the leaf-scars in the two are quite dif- 

 ferent. 2d. The vascular scars differ in outline and in Sternb. 's species they 

 are marked with three dots which are wanting in Owen's. 3d. Tubercles are 

 present in L. a c u 1 e a t u ra Sternb. but not in Owen's figures. Finally the 

 margins of the cicatrices differ.

 obsolete, sometimes confluent) dots ; appendices distinct ; medial line very 

 strongly marked, transversely rugose. 



It is with great pleasure that we dedicate this handsome species to Prof. 

 Lesquereux, to whom every American Geologist is indebted for time and toil 

 spent in elucidating the ancient Flora of this continent. This plant, besides 

 the above characters, has also a crescentic scar, situated in the apex of leaf- 

 scar and marked with two, often obsolete, dots. Locality unknown. Posi-

 marked ; tubercles obsolete ; medial line distinct, transversely rugose. 



This species is allied to L. elegan s Brong., but is separated from it by 

 the scars being more elongated and the consecutive ones communicating, as 

 well as by the difference in the proportion of the length to the breadth of the 

 cicatriculi and the much greater rugosity of medial line. Two magnificent 

 specimens were presented to the Academy by Mr. Borda, the largest measuring 

 3 feet 7 inches by 13 inches. Locality and position, Top slates of Back Vein,

Mr. Lesquereux, in his "Catalogue of American Coal Plants," gives L.cras-

 appear at first sight to have been connected with it, but closer examination 

 shows this not to have been the case.

 frontals. the want of anterior prolongation of the vertical, the concavity of the 

 rostral, and presence of anterior frontals, distinguish the latter from Aniblyme- 

 topon. In these genera the teeth are smooth, of equal lengths and a little 

 stouter posteriorly. In Arrhyton* Gthr. (Cat. Brit. Mus. p. 244) the posterior 

 upper maxillary is longer, and separated from the anterior by an interspace, 

 (diacranterian.) These genera possess a strong resemblance to the Calama- 

 rian type of form where some of them have been placed by authors but we 

 believe them to be more nearly allied to the Stenorhina, Rhinostoma and Cemo- 

 phora, which are not to be separated from the Coronelliform genera Simotes, 

 Lampropeltis, etc. Indeed, comparison with such typical Calamarian forms as 

 Calamaria, Aspidura, Rhabdosoma, Carphophiops, etc., shows a less complete 

 want of distinction of head and body, a less degree of rigidity of the latter, 

 and a greater resemblance to the higher types in the forms of the superciliary 

 and labial plates. We do not think their small size at all conclusive as to their 

 pertinence to the Calamarinae, though an opposite opinion might be held by 

 such herpetologists as would place the Old World " Ablabes," the Diadophis 

 and Tamiophis of the New in that group. 



Allied to Toluca and Cemophora nobis, is a genus inhabiting the south- 

 western regions of the United States, called Lamprosoma by Dr. Hallowell, 

 (Proceed. Acad. N. S. viii. p. 311.) As this name was previously employed by 

 Kirby for a genus of Coleoptera, we propose replacing it here by Chionactis, 

 given in allusion to the refulgent whiteness of the scales. The typical and 

 only well-ascertained species is Rhinostoma occipitale Hallow., (Proc. 

 Acad. vii. 1854, p. 95.) This serpent has been erroneously stated by Dr. Giin- 

 ther, P. Z. S. 1858, p. 387, to be a native of West Africa. The muzzle is more 

 depressed than in Toluca, and there is a loreal plate. The equal teeth, single 

 nasal and more depressed head and snout, separate it from Cemophora.

86. S. ? 



We have before us two specimens of the young of what is probably an under- 

 scribed species of Stenorhina. Their immature age is indicated by the division 

 of several of the gastrosteges upon the umbilical region. In both specimens 

 the tail is only one-eighth of the total length, in the ventralis a little more 

 than one-fifth. The scales in the latter are relatively larger, and the vertical 

 plate a little broader. In a specimen of the former, from Veragua, the gastros- 

 teges number 165, urosteges 35 ; in the second, collected by Dr. Sartorius in 

 the hills west of Vera Cruz, and in the possession of the Smithsonian Institute, 

 they are 155x 3 2. In the ventralis the Erp. Gen. gives 149x44. The 



[June,

color of our specimens is light brown, crossed by numerous bands or elongated 

 spots of deep brown bordered with paler. Sides and belly spotted with the 

 same. 



The specimen of S. ventral is sent to the Smithsonian Institution by Dr. 

 Sartorius corresponds with the description in the Erpetologie Generale in 

 nearly every respect. The color is, however, a very deep slate above, so that 

 the transverse spots are scarcely visible. The gastrosteges are much clouded 

 with slate, and the longitudinal markings are also indistinct. Chin and lower 

 labial plates tinged with bright yellow. There is no specimen of this species 

 in the Academy Museum.

 Posterior angle of the rostral plate a right-angle. Anterior frontals forming 

 a short suture with each other ; posterior frontals forming no suture, their tips 

 only in contact, so that their posterior borders are diagonally continuous with 

 the posterior borders of the anterior frontals. Vertical plate presenting a 

 right angle anteriorly ; its superciliary border shortest of all. Occipitals 

 shorter than vertical, each bounded by one large and five small temporals. 



*Gvalopion nobis. Form stout; tail one-eighth of total length Head slightly 

 distinct, large, depressed. Rostral plate acute; its anterior border elevated ; its upper 

 surface concave. It is produced backwards, separating the prefontals, not reaching the 

 vertical. Frontals, two pair. Nasal confounded with the first labial, a groove from 

 the nostril to the suture of the second labial. No loreal, its place supplied by the post 

 frontal. One pre- two postoculars. Scales smooth ; anal and eubcaudal scutellae divided. 

 Teeth small, of equal lengths. Pupil round. 



P. c a n u m nobis. Prefrontals triangular, not larger than preoculars. Postoculars of 

 equal size. Anterior border of vertical not angulated. Occipitals as broad as long,

Coloration. Above brownish grey, crossed by thirty-one irregular transverse brown 

 bands. These are from one to three scales wide on ihe back, and extend to the gas- 

 troteges. Anteriorly they exhibit a tendency to divide into a dorsal and two lateral 

 series of spots. Eight transverse spots on the tail. First spot on the neck large, 

 produced medially to the occipitals. A brown band extends from one angle of the 

 mouth to the other across the occipitals, involving the tip of the vertical. Another 

 brown band commences upon the upper borders of the lower labial shields, passes 

 through the eye, and crosses the anterior parts of superciliaries and vertical, and 

 posterior parts of postfrontals and rostral. Dirty yellowish beneath, and upon the first 

 row of scales. One specimen (No. 4675,) in the National Museum, Washington, dis- 

 covered near Ft. Buchanan, Arizona, by Dr. Irwin. It is an extraordinary serpent, re- 

 sembling, at first sight, a diminutive Heterodon.

A. Form stout, calamarian ; anal shield entire. 



92. S. phsenochalinus nobis. This is a small serpent, and resembles 

 an Oligodon in form. The arrangement and number of cephalic plates are the 

 same as in the Russellii, except that the rostral plate is higher, and not 

 produced so far back upon the muzzle, and that the vertical is not so broad, 

 and with lateral borders less convergent posteriorly. Superior labials seven, 

 the third and fourth entering the orbit; inferior labials eight. Scales in 

 seventeen rows small, rounded. Gastroteges 172, an anal, urosteges 41 pairs. 

 Total length 7 inches 9 lines. Tail 1 inch. 



The ground color is a light brown, and is crossed above by short black 

 transverse bands, about fifteen in number, from the head to the end of the tail. 

 These bands are wider on the back, and taper on the flanks. A transverse 

 black band crosses the head from eye to eye on each side of the posterior 



[June,

suture of the postfrontals, and is continued beneath the eye on the suture of 

 the fourth and fifth labials. A longitudinal black band proceeds from the 

 transverse, passes through the middle of the vertical and along the suture of 

 the occipitals, then widens and bifurcates on the neck. A crescentic black 

 mark begins near the exterior border of the occipital plate, and extends a 

 little beyond the commissure of the mouth, crossing the seventh upper labial. 

 One sp. Manilla. Dr. Barnwell. 



One sp. Philippine Islands. Mr. Cuming, in ex. 



The second of these specimens has, alternating with the cros3 bands, a 

 transverse series of four separate spots; two dorsal, rounded, and one on each 

 side, narrow. 



93. S. aphanospilus nobis. In this species the head and investing plates 

 are shorter and broader than those of the last species ; the sides of the vertical 

 shields are more convergent posteriorly. As in other Simotes there are one 

 pre- and two postoculars. Loreal a little longer than high ; upper labials seven, 

 third and fourth entering the orbit ; inferior labials eight, the posterior one 

 very small. Scales large, obtuse, imbricate, in seventeen rows. Geneials two 

 pair, the posterior half the length of the anterior. Gastrosteges 173, anal one, 

 urosteges 37 pairs. Length of body and tail 23 in. 5 1. ; tail alone 3 in. 4 1. 



The color of the upper surface of this serpent is a dull olive brown. From 

 the neck to the base of the tail we count thirteen nearly equidistant scutcheon- 

 shaped figures, brown bordered with black. These extend a short distance on 

 the flanks, and are sometimes confluent with another series of smaller, similar 

 figures on each side. In the middle of the interval between each dorsal figure 

 is a small black spot. On the head the arrangement of markings is similar to 

 that of the last species. They are, however, only indicated by narrow black 

 borders enclosing the ground color. Lips and beneath dirty yellowish. 

 One specimen. Philippines. Mr. Cuming, in ex. 



The two species preceding are nearly allied to the S. purpurascens 

 Gthr., but comparison with the figures of Schlegel and Dum. et Bibr. at once 

 reveals the differences in the markings of the head. The number of labials is 

 also different.

Hypsiglena nobis. Type H. ochrorhynchus. 



Dentition diacranterian ; i. e. a long, smooth, posterior superior maxillary 

 tooth, separated from the anterior by an edentulous space. Pupil elliptic, 

 erect, body cylindrical. Head distinct, broad posteriorly, shortly conic ante- 

 riorly, much depressed. Cephalic shields normal. Two nasals, nostril be- 

 tween ; one loreal ; two pre-and two postoculars. Scales smooth. Gastros- 

 teges not angulated. Anal and subcaudal scutellaj divided. Tail less than 

 one fourth the total length. 



This curious genus has points of resemblance to Sibon Fitz., Hemidipsas 

 Gthr., Tachymenis Wiegm.; while the general appearance is not unlike that of 

 Coronella Laur. A perusal of the above diagnosis, cannot fail to convince the 

 herpetologist that it possesses characters strongly distinguishing it from all, 

 uniting as it does, in its general aspect, peculiarities of certain tropical and 

 northern forms. 



100. H. ochrorhynchus nobis. Muzzle shortly conic ; rostral plate 

 prominent, encroaching a little on the pre-frontals. Nasal plates indistinctly 

 separated, equal, their upper and lower borders parallel. Loreal longer than 

 high. Lower preocular small, bounded anteriorly by the third upper labial. 

 Eight upper labials, fourth and fifth entering the orbit; sixth and seventh very 

 large. Vertical plate twice as long as broad ; lateral borders slightly con- 

 vergent. Superciliaries narrow ; occipitals as long or longer than vertical, 

 rounded posteriorly. Inferior labials eleven, sixth largest. Geneials two pair, 

 the posterior acute. Scales in twenty-one rows. Gastrosteges 168, urosteges 

 48 pair. Total length, 12 in. 4 lines, tail 2 in. 3 lines. 



Coloration. The upper surface light grey, with a series of large brown spots, 

 separated by intervals of one scale wide. These spots are about forty-eight in 

 number, upon the body; they extend transversely from the seventh to the 

 fifteenth rows of scales, and are three or four scales in length. On the poste- 

 rior part of the body they sometimes divide longitudinally, their moieties 

 alternating or becoming confluent into a zig-zag band. 



Alternating with these on each side, is a series of small spots formed by the 

 brown borders of scales of the fifth and sixth rows. Another series of small 

 spots opposite to the dorsal row, is formed by the shading of the adjacent bor- 

 ders of the fourth and fifth rows with the same color. Many of the scales of 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 247 



the second row are also tipped with brown. There is a large brown spot on 

 each side of the neck, sometimes confluent with an elongate central one, which 

 extends to the occipital plates. A brown stripe passes from the eye to the neck 

 spot, entirely covering the last upper labial. Top of the head brownish grey, 

 indistinctly spotted with pale brown. Labial plate paler; frontals and rostral 

 ochreous. Beneath yellowish-white, immaculate. 



One specimen in the Academy, and nnmerous others in the National 

 Museum, Washington, received from Mr. John Xantus, from Cape St. Lucas, 

 California. 



101. H. chlorophaea nobis. Number of labials and rows of scales 

 the same as in the last species. The scales of the body are, however, more 

 elongate, and partly on this account are arranged in rows more oblique in an 

 antero-posterior direction. The vertical plate is a little broader, and the head 

 is narrower in proportion to its length. The body is rather more slender. 



The color is a greenish ash, much darker than in the preceding species. The 

 dorsal spots, instead of being brown, are black, and separated by intervals of 

 two scales in width. They are much smaller, occupying only the space from 

 the ninth to the thirteenth longitudinal rows, and are one scale and a half 

 long. They frequently divide and alternate, and their number on the body 

 amounts to from fifty-eight to sixty-six. Two rows of smaller alternating spots 

 appear on the sides, one upon the sixth and seventh rows of scales, the other 

 on the fourth. The distribution of colors on the head and neck is much as in 

 the last species, except that the neck spots are a little longer. The brown is, 

 however, replaced by black, and the ochreous by olivaceous. The crown and 

 muzzle are thickly punctulated with black. Beneath pale olivaceous. Gas- 

 trosteges 167, urosteges 55. Total length, 15 in. 6 1., of tail 2 in. 3 1.

 seem, however, to differ but little from those of the preceding species ; the pre- 

 frontals are relatively smaller, and the superciliaries larger. There are eight 

 superior labial shields, the eye resting on the fourth and fifth: the sixth and 

 seventh are disproportionately large. Nine inferior labials. Scales large, in 

 nineteen rows, the exposed part of those of the first row higher than long. 

 Body stout ; gastrosteges 140, one divided anal ; urosteges 52, relatively more 

 numerous than in T. Chilensis. 



Coloration. The upper surface of the head, body and tail, is of a wood 

 brown, many of the scales black at their bases. The first, second, third and

fourth rows of scales are densely punctulated with black, thus forming an in- 

 distinct band upon each side. The punctulations are more numerous upon the 

 fourth row, hence the band is better defined upon its dorsal margin. A pair 

 of dark bands commence upon the occipital plates, and extend a short dis- 

 tance upon the back, enclosing a light vitta. The dark bands send off upon 

 each side two branches, one to the middle of the superciliary plate, and one 

 to the superior suture of the upper postocular. From the inferior su- 

 ture of the same plate, a deep brown vitta extends to the angle of the 

 of the mouth ; this continued in front of the orbit as far as the nostril. The 

 superior labial shields are paler than the crown, are punctulated, and have 

 upon their postero-superior angle a triangular brown mark. Belly yellowish- 

 grey, densely punctulated with black, (whence the name.) On each side, the 

 gastrosteges are crossed near their extremities by a narrow black band, which 

 is continuous from the throat to the end of the tail. Anteriorly the punctu- 

 lations arrange themselves in two series of indistinct V-shaped marks within the 

 bands but they are quite ill defined, and in some specimens will probably be 

 absent. 



One specimen. Buenos Ayres. Dr. A. Kennedy. 



Coniophanes Hallowell, MSS. Type C. fissidens.* 



This genus consists of coronelliform serpents with grooved teeth, of rather a 

 slender habit, having a distinct, depressed head, conic muzzle, one preocular 

 and a divided anal plate. Perhaps the Coronella bipunctata of Giinther 

 belongs to it. 



It differs from Dromicus in the grooved maxillary tooth, and the less lanceo- 

 late head. Philodryas has a much more elongate body and tail. A peculiarity 

 in the coloration of the species consists in the numerous punctulations of the 

 upper and under surface, whence probably the name (kovioc pulverulentus.) 



104. C. punctigularis nobis. Scales thin, lanceolate, in twenty-one 

 longitudinal rows. Head broad posteriorly, muzzle rather shortly conic. Pre- 

 frontals equal in size to the fourth superior labial ; post-nasal larger than pre- 

 nasal ; loreal as high as long ; preocular not reaching the vertical. Vertical 

 elongate, its sides parallel ; occipitals moderate, each bounded by two large, 

 and two small temporals. Postoculars two ; superior labials eight ; eye over 

 the fourth and fifth. Symphyseal unusually broad ; inferior labials nine. 

 Gastrosteges 121, one divided anal, urosteges 44, (tail mutilated.) Total 

 length 14 in. 6 1. Tail 3 in. 4 1. (was probably nearly two inches longer. 



Coloration. Above, dark chestnut-brown, shaded with grey on the top of the 

 head. On each side of the neck, three scales behind the terminal superior 

 labial, a whitish line commences. These widen, assume a pale ferruginous 

 hue, and extend to the tip of the tail. They cover the sixth, seventh and 

 half of the fifth and eighth rows of scales on each side, and enclose a brown 

 dorsal band five scales wide. Upon the neck the brown of the sides is very 

 deep, and extends forward as a band to the orbit. It is bordered beneath 

 with white. Lips and throat yellowish-white, densely punctulated with 

 brown. Gastrosteges also yellowish-white, punctulated irregularly at their 

 tips. 



One specimen. Honduras. Mr. J. S. Hawkins k Dr. J. L. LeConte. 



C. fissidens Hallow, differs from the present species in several points. 

 The body is more elongate, there being 140 gastrosteges instead of 121. The 

 head is more depressed, and the muzzle more prominent, since the prefrontal 

 plates are in the plane of the occipitals. This form, together with the dark

color, and the narrow light band on the upper borders of the labials, is suggest- 

 ive of certain genera of venomous snakes, as Hypnale. The lateral borders 

 of the vertical plate in fissidens are not so long nor so nearly parallel as 

 in punctigularis. The whole head is relatively narrower. The colors 

 of the former are deeper, the longitudinal bands being very indistinct. The 

 throat is not so thickly punctulated.*

 U. S. Astronomical Expedition, ii. p. 215. 1855. 



105. T. vermiculaticeps nobis. Size small; form slender; tail one- 

 third the total length. Head distinct, elongate ovoid ; the muzzle short and 

 the eye large and far forward. The last superior maxillary tooth is longer 

 than those preceding it, and smooth. As in the other species of the genus, 

 there are two postoculars, one preocular, and a divided postabdominal scu- 

 tella. Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows. Frontal plates small, super- 

 ciliaries and vertical elongate, the latter with its anterior border nearly straight, 

 the lateral slightly convergent. Nostril principally in the prenasal ; postnasal 

 higher. Loreal as high as long ; preocular narrow and high, not reaching the 

 vertical. Superior postocular twice as long as the inferior. Superior labials 

 eight, fourth and fifth enteringthe orbit. Inferior labials ten. Geneials two 

 pair, the posterior one-third longer than the anterior, divaricating. Gastros- 

 teges 117, one anal, urosteges 79. Total length of the largest specimen 13 in. 

 8 lin. Tail 4 in. 7 lin. 



Coloration. The ground color of the upper surface of the body is a rich yel- 

 lowish brown where the epidermis is lost, of a brownish straw color. A pair 

 of deep brown bands begin, one at the externo-posterior angle of each super- 

 ciliary shield, and converge upon the neck. There each narrows to a width 

 of one scale, and enclosing a vitta of the ground color one scale in width, ex- 

 tends to the origin of the tail. Here they unite, and extend to the extremity 

 of that member as a median band. A second pair of brown bands commences 

 one at each nostril. It passes through the eye to beyond the angle of the 

 mouth, where its inferior border becomes ill denned, and continues so through- 

 out its whole length. The upper border is clearly defined to the end of the 

 tail. The medial light dorsal vitta bifurcates on the neck, and extends as far 

 as the superciliary plates. The intermediate space is irregularly vermiculated 

 with delicate marks of the same color. Upper and lower labials whitish, nar- 



* The following is the description of a third species of this genus, a single specimen of 

 which is in possession of ihe National Museum, Washington. It was discovered hy Sr. 

 R. M. De Oca in the vicinity of Jalapa, Mexico. 



C. proterops nobis. Size rather small. Scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, thin, 

 elongate, obtuse. Head scarcely distinct, short profile of muzzle not elevated. Anterior 

 plates of the head small ; loreal a little longer than high. One pre- two postoculars. 

 Superior labials seven, third and fourth entering the orbit. Vertical plate elongate, late- 

 ral borders convergent, posterior angle acute. Occipitals long. Inferior labials nine ; 

 geneials two pairs, nearly equal. Gastrosteges 130, anal one, divided, urosteges ? (tail 

 badly mutilated.) Head and body 9 in. 7 lin. in length. The stump of the tail appears 

 tetragonal in section. 



Coloration. Above light brown, every scale densely punctulated with darker, especially 

 near the margins. From the first to the fourth row of scales this is deeper, giving the 

 sides a darker shade. The vertebral row of scales, from the occipitals to the end of the 

 tail is also darker. Top of the head densely and obscurely vermiculated and punctulated. 

 The dark shade on the fourth row of scales becomes a band anteriorly, and is bordered 

 above and below with white on the neck. The lower white border is continued to the 

 eye, and is bordered above on the labials with black. The upper white border is discon- 

 tinued on the neck, but reappears as a spot, three scales back of the occipitals. Inferior 

 half of rostral, upper and lower labials, chin, throat and belly, light brownish yellow, 

 densely punctulated with brown. Each labial with a darker spot in the centre. Fewer 

 punctulations on the urosteges.

This very elegant species was discovered in Veragua, New Grenada, by Mr. 

 R. W. Mitchell, who presented two specimens to the Academy. We also 

 possess a third specimen, native country unknown. It is nearly allied to 

 T. tantillus Girard, 1. c, but in that the vertical plate is narrower, the 

 sides subconcave, and in contact anteriorly with the preocular. The colora- 

 tion is also quite different.

One of our specimens has two preocular plates, another three. In neither 

 do we find the upper maxillary teeth materially longer behind. Nevertheless, 

 our placing this serpent in Diadophis is altogether provisional ; in the unusual 

 length of tail, as well as in distribution of colors, it differs from this genus. 

 We will not give a detailed description at present, as the color of our speci- 

 mens has been altered by the loss of the epidermis. The four bright yellow 

 spots on the occiput and nape render this a very distinct as well as beautiful 

 species.

the distinctions would not be borne out. The number of rows of scales is fif- 

 teen ; the superior labials are seven, eye resting ou third and fourth, as ia 

 sometimes the case in punctatus. Color above light brownish olive, a 

 broad yellow collar, bordered with black as in punctatus. Each gastros- 

 tege has a brown dot at its extremity, and the central part of the margin the 

 same color, forming a series of transversely elongated spots. Fifth and sixth 

 upper labials each with a brown dot. Symphyseal and lower labials with a 

 brown dot in the centre of each, two on each anterior geneial, one at the pos- 

 terior end of postgeneials and of all the throat scales. 

 One specimen, locality and donor unknown. 



109. D. dysope s nobis. Scales in 15 rows ; superior labials eight, eye 

 resting on the fourth and fifth ; inferior labials eight. Color above olivaceous 

 slate blue, beneath light yellowish brown, with three longitudinal rows of 

 spots. A very narrow yellow collar involving a part only of each scale that 

 it crosses, and bordered with blackish. Upper borders of superior labials 

 (not temporals) black. It is in the form of the head that it it differs from the 

 punctatus most strikingly. The muzzle is very short, rounded and de- 

 pressed; hence the rostral, frontrals and anterior labials are very small. The 

 ioreal is a little smaller than the tipper postocular. The vertical is small, the 

 lateral borders convergent. Superciliaries short and broad, occipitals long, 

 bordered by five temporal plates on each side. Breadth of the head at the 

 angle of the mouth but little less than the length anterior to the same point.

It is now the opinion of Mr. Kennicott that this small serpent does not be- 

 long to the Lamprosoma of Hallowell. We concur with him in this, and be- 

 lieve that it cannot be generically distinguished from the species just preced- 

 ing. It resembles certain Calamarian genera, but were its size quadrupled the 

 similarity would probably disappear.

Three of the young specimens have a pair of white clots on the occipital

 small white C-like marks, apparent in specimens of this age, remains during 

 adult age in some, thus affording a transition to the 



Var. A. Gthr. With distinct transverse light bands. 

 One sp. Para. Col. Abert. 



113. L. breviceps nobis. Head short, not very distinct from the body 

 Plates of the head similar to those of L. cobella except that the occipital 

 plates are shorter ; the vertical is broader, its lateral borders measuring less 

 than the anterior ; the rostral is broader ; and there are but seven superior 

 labials, the third and fourth entering the orbit. The sixth superior labial 

 widens upwards, and supports nearly the whole length of the temporal. In 

 L. cobella the upper margin of this plate is shorter than the lower. Two 

 postoculars, both in contact with the first temporal. Second temporal large, 

 one or two other small ones. One preocular ; loral small. Eight inferior 

 labials, fifth largest, anterior part in contact with posterior geneials (sixth and 

 seventh in cobella). Scales in seventeen rows. Gastrosteges 154, a 

 bifid anal, urosteges 54 pair. Total length 17 in. 5 lines. Tail 3 in. 2 lin. 



Color above, a deep brown without a trace of the small white marks of the 

 cobella, becoming darker posteriorly, and reaching to the gastrosteges. 

 It is crossed by very indistinct darker bands, formed by a single dark scale in 

 every other longitudinal row. These bands are two or three scales apart, and 

 unite on the flanks, into the black transverse bands of the belly, which are 

 irregular and broad, almost excluding the yellow ground in some places. 

 One spec. Surinam. Dr. Hering. 



Obs. Comparison with our specimens ofL. cobella has induced us to 

 consider this distinct on account of : First, the comparative smallness of the 

 head ; second, the shortness of the head shields ; third, the less number of 

 labials ; fourth, the form of the sixth superior labial ; lastly, the color ; which, 

 however, is of but little importance considered alone. It recalls the genus 

 Helicops.

 Anal scute bifid. Scales smooth. Dentition as in Lampropeltis ; i. e. the 

 posterior superior maxillaries not isolated, longer, much recurved and smooth. 



The great length of the tail separates this genus from Lampropeltis and 

 Erythrolamprus : it unites the dentition of the former with the preanal scute 

 of the latter. Coronella and Phimothyra ?iobis have comparatively short tails. In 

 Coniophanes the head is more distinct, the body more slender and not so 

 firmly cylindrical. 



119. P. elapoides nobis. 



Rostral plated just visible from above : prefontals one third the size of the 

 postfrontals. Length and breadth of the vertical plate equal to the suture of 

 the occipitals. The latter are oval, and rounded behind. Jive marginal 

 temporals on each side. Upper preocular large, not reaching the vertical ; 

 inferior one very small, partially between the third and fourth superior labials. 

 Height and length of loreal equal. Eight superior labials, fourth and fifth enter- 

 ing the orbit. Inferior labials eight, the last three times as long as the seventh, 

 sixth largest ; these three plates border within a large shield which diverges 

 from the outer posterior extremity of the posterior geneial. Two equal pairs 

 of elongated geneials. Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows. Gastrosteges 

 131 ; urosteges 89 pair. Total length of adult, 19 in. 9 1., tail 7 in. 6 1. 



Coloration. The ground color is brilliant red, which encircles the body 

 above and below in bands of from four to six scales in width. These are 

 separated by triads of black rings including yellow intervals, ten or eleven 

 on the body, one at the anus, and six or seven on the tail. The outer ring 

 of each triad is one and a half scales wide, and is not continued on the belly ; 

 the yellow interval is of the same width, and the central black ring is three 

 and a half or four scales wide. The first triad is upon the head and neck ; 

 the central black ring is seven or eight scales wide and does not extend upon 

 the neck, but involves the ends of the occipitals and the last upper labial. The 

 anterior yellow ring crosses the occipitals, and involves one and a half tempo-

rals, the sixth, seventh and half the eight upper labials. All the head anterior 

 to this is lustrous black, except a narrow oral border of yellow. Chin 

 immaculate. Many of the scales of the body are tipped with brown, many 

 with black. 



This beautiful species resembles in the distribution of its colors certain 

 Elapses particularly decoratus and Dumerilii. It is a beautiful 

 example of analogy of coloring. We have four specimens, one adult, one half 

 grown, and two young, which were obtained through the liberality of John 

 Cassin, Esq., from Sr. R. M. De Oca who collected them near Jalapa, Mexico. 



Lampropeltis Fitzinger. Type L. S a y i . 



Systema Reptilium, 1843, p. 25, et Sphenophis ead. loc. OphiboJus Baird and 

 Girard, Catal. Serp. Smiths. Inst. 1852, p. 82. Coluber, Pseudoeryx, Coronella et 

 Ablabes sp. auctorum. 



This group was first defined, and its species enumerated by Profs. Baird and 

 Girard, in their "Catalogue." In structural peculiarities it fulfils all the 

 requisites of a strictly natural group. It represents in America the Coronella 

 of the Old World, from which it differs in possessing an undivided postab- 

 dominal scutella, and a peculiar form of posterior upper maxillary teeth . 

 These are closely set, stout, much compressed and trenchant, with their 

 anterior borders rather abraptly curved backwards. It also approaches 

 Erythrolamprus, which may be distinguished by the grooved superior maxilla- 

 ries, and divided postabdominal scutella. In geographical range it extends from 

 Maine (L. t r i a n g u 1 a) to Panama (L. micropholis.) 



In the Neue Classification der Reptilien of Fitzinger, (1826) p. 55, we find 

 that the seventh genus of the nineteenth family of that author, Colubroidea, 

 is Pseudoeryx Fitz. There are seven species enumerated, and the Coluber 

 doliatusof Linne is the first. Where there is no possibility of ascertaining 

 what species an author assigns as the type of his genus, it is the practice of 

 naturalists to regard as such that which stands first in his enumeration. 

 Adopting that rule in the present instance, we should have to employ Pseu- 

 doeryx in place of Lampropeltis of later date a substitution by no means to 

 be desired. Fortunately, however, we believe that Fitzinger did indicate with 

 sufficient olearness what type of form he intended to characterize. On page 

 29 of the same work he thus characterizes Pseudoeryx : " Abdomen scutatum. 

 Cauda non oompressa. Oculi verticale*. Rostrum rotundatum." Thisdignosis 

 at once shows that he considered the third* species on the list P. D a u d i n i i 

 (Dimades plioatilis Gray, ) as the true representative of the genus ; and for 

 it, the name Pseudoeryx is not inappropriate. This supposition is confirmed 

 by the fact that in his Systema Reptilium, published in 1843, hejretains the 

 genus, and distinotly assigns P. plioatilis as the type.

The posterior supermaxillary teeth are but little longer than the anterior, 

 but are much stouter, and strongly compressed, as in other species of the

 less number of the transverse bands. In getula they number from 30 to

This species is attributed to Say by Harlan and others, but after a most 

 careful examination of Long's Expedition to the Rocky Mountains, we have 

 failed to discover any allusion to it by that author. 



In the second volume of that work, p. 330, it is stated that such of the speci- 

 mens collected by the expedition as arrived in Philadelphia, were deposited 

 in the Philadelphia museum. It was from specimens of the present species in 

 that collection that Harlan drew up his description ; and the same are alluded 

 to by Dr. Holbrook, N. Amer. Herp. iii. p. 72, where he asserts their identity 

 with the Coluber e x i m i u s . One of these, a stuffed skin, presented to the 

 Academy by Dr. Holbrook, and labelled by Dr. Hallowell "original specimen," 

 is now before us. We can assert its identity with the Ophibolus Evansii of 

 Kennicott both from his description and from comparison with specimens 

 collected by Dr. Hammond in Kansas, and described by Hallowell 1. c. They 

 all have twenty-five rows of smooth scales. 



As to the Scotophis calligaster of Kennicott, 1. c, which belongs to a 

 genus different from the present, we believe it is a serpent distinct from the 

 Coluber calligaster of Harlan, although in the description of the former 

 author we read " there can be no hesitation in referring this species to the 

 Coluber calligaster of Say. " In order to avoid the confusion which must 

 result from the possession of the same specific name by two serpents closely 

 resembling each other, and inhabiting the same section of country, we propose 

 for the species of Mr. Kennicott the appellation rhinomegas.

The dentition of this species is not different from that characteristic of the 

 genus. The posterior upper maxillary teeth are longer and stronger than the 

 anterior, though not so much so as in L. Sayi. They are thickly set, so 

 compressed as to give them a great antero-posterior diameter, and have a 

 rather abrupt posterior curvature. This species cannot be arranged in the 

 same genus as Lycodonomorphus rufulus Fitz. (type of Ablabes Dum. & 

 Bibr. ) which, according- to Schlegel and Smith, has the anterior maxillary teeth 

 a little longer than the posterior. The tail is one fourth or fifth of the total 

 length, while in all the species of Lampropeltis before us, that member is very 

 short, being never more than one seventh or one eighth of the total length. The 

 arrangement of this species with the Coluber guttatusis simply the result 

 of a mistaking of analogy for affinity. 



We have seen no second specimen which corresponds with the type of Profs. 

 Baird and Girard' s Ophibolus c 1 e r i c u s in the form of the head and position 

 and size of the eye. The specimen alluded to by Dr. Hallowell, 1. c, from New 

 Jersey, approximates remotely in these respects, though resembling it much 

 in the number and size of the dorsal spots. We incline to think that no cha- 

 racters of specific value can be deduced from these ; there are specimens inter- 

 mediate, as respects their size and number, between the highest in eximius 

 to the lowest in clericus, as defined in Baird and Girard's catalogue. And 

 there are indifferently one or two rows of spots on the sides. What the true 

 clericus is, more specimens alone can show.

In the true Coronella doliata of the Eastern States the black rings form- 

 ing each pair, separate on the flanks, and become more or less confluent with 

 the adjacent ring of the next pair. The belly is also irregularly varied with 

 black. These peculiarities are well represented in Holbrook's figure. The

This species is closely allied to the preceding, but may be distinguished by 

 the following peculiarities : The scales are in seventeen and nineteen rows 

 instead of twenty-one. The pairs of rings are fewer in number, (thirteen to 

 seventeen on the body,) and do not become confluent on the flanks. The 

 belly is not varied with black. From the anterior part of the occipital plates 

 to the muzzle the color is red, not white or yellow, and without black punc- 

 tulations. The muzzle is depressed, and the superciliary plates are very small, 

 giving the eyes a greater vertical field than in the d i o 1 a t a. The tips of the 

 occipitals are crossed by the first yellow ring. 



Many of these peculiarities are alluded to in the very accurate description 

 of Herr Schlegel, and to us it is perfectly plain that he had the present species 

 before him when writing it. The species is probably southern in its distribu- 

 tion.

 species of the genus, resembles d o 1 i a t a, but the scales are very broad, and 

 the gastrosteges opposite to the red interval of the back are totally black. The 

 confluence of the black rings bordering the red does not take place on the 

 scales of the sides. For a more detailed description we refer to Kennicott's 

 forthcoming article.

130. L. micropholis nobis. Scales in twenty-one longitudinal rows, 

 small, short and obtuse. Temporal region swollen, giving the depressed head 

 an appearance of distinctness. Plates of the head much as in doliata ; the 

 superciliaries and vertical are however larger, and the longitudinal line of 

 suture of the occipitals is only three -fourths the length of the latter plate. 

 The outer borders of the occipitals present two posterior divaricating angles, 

 and one on each side at the end of the first temporal. Upper labials seven, 

 third and fourth entering the orbit. Inferior labials nine, the seventh twice 

 as large as the last two together. Other particulars as in d o 1 i a t a, Gastros- 

 teges 219 ; one entire anal ; urosteges 43 pair. Total length 16 in. 11 1. ; tail 

 2 in. 



The color is a delicate red with a black tip upon each scale. The body is 

 completely encircled by ten pairs of jet black rings, which are anteriorly ten 

 scales apart, posteriorly seven. The space included in each pair is three or 

 four scales wide, and is red not yellow each scale having a black tip. The 

 tail is ornamented with two pair of black rings and a black tip. Eighteen 

 scales anterior to the first pair of rings, a black collar four scales wide encircles 

 the neck, scarcely touching the tips of the occipitals. The superciliary

 Rostral large, full, postfrontals large, occipitals more elongate than in m i c r o-

 seven, eye over the third and fourth, first in contact with loreal.* Inferior

The ground color above and below is bright red ; the scales are largely 

 tipped with black. In specimen No. 1 there are twenty-seven pairs of black 

 rings on the body and tail. In a few instances the double rings become con- 

 fluent, forming an elongate annular spot. The gastrosteges are irregularly 

 spotted with black, and are almost entirely of that color where the rings cross 

 the belly. Specimen No. 2, which we take to be more typical, is ornamented 

 with twenty-eight pairs of rings only three or four scales apart, and perfect on 

 the belly. In both the pairs include a space but one and a half scales wide, of 

 a pale reddish above, more yellow below. A black collar involves the tips of 

 the occipitals and the last superior labial. In front of this a yellow band 

 crosses the occipitals. The rest of the head is black, a few scales with pale 

 borders, which hue predominates on the chin.f

 It differs from it in having no yellow marking whatever upon it, and in the black rings 

 being but one scale and a half wide instead of three, and in the smaller size. 1 he first 

 black ring does not touch the occipital plates, in this resembling the c o c ci n e a, which 

 differs in having nineteen rows of scales, and yellow rings. The head and plates are 

 broad and short, the scales as in do li at a, and more lanceolate than inannulata 

 Kenn. Though loth to add another to the already difficult series of red Lampropeltes, 

 the more we have thought of it the more are we impressed with the belief that this is 

 deserving of recognition as a species. Unite it with any species with which we are ac- 

 quainted, and the characters which distinguish all the species in the series from trian-

Number of the plates of the head the same as in the venustissimus .

 temporal region more swollen, and the whole head deeper and more obtuse. 

 Rows of scales fifteen. Gastrosteges, 167 ; one divided anal ; urosteges, 48. 



The ground color of the upper and under surface of this serpent is white, 

 as a note made by Mr. Samuel Ashmead, its discoverer, at the time of iti 

 capture, informs us. This is crossed on the body, by ten or thirteen black 

 single rings four or five scales wide, and from seven to twelve scales apart. 

 Another ring crosses at the anus, and there are two double rings on the tail. 

 The scales in the white intervals are broadly tipped with black. The distri-

 a broad black collar which crosses the tips of the occipitals and does not 

 encircle the throat. The fifth and sixth upper labials, the first temporal, the 

 tips of the plates adjoining them posteriorly, and a spot on the occipitals, are 

 white. The rostral, first two labials, nasals and loreal are bordered with the 

 same, the rest of the head is black. Chin immaculate.

Schneider's name for this genus possesses the right of priority over that of 

 Merrem. The almost universal acceptation of the latter by herpetologists, is 

 also the more to be regretted as the type is not known. The relative num- 

 ber of the gastro- and urosteges in the Scytale anguiformis of Merrem 

 renders its identity with Erythrolamprus venustissimus very improb- 

 able.

 which will probably be found to be divided in other specimens. Inferior 

 labials eight. Geneials two pair, broad. Scales in nineteen longitudinal 

 rows. Gastrosteges 161, one entire anal, urosteges 45. Total length 25 in.

Our specimens correspond exactly with the description of Dr. J. G. Fischer,

 Dumeril loc. sup. cit. identifies the Coelopeltis v i r g a t a of Hallowell with 

 the Booden capensis D. &. B., and there is a possibility that the specimen 

 received by him from the Acad. Mus. belongs to the latter species. Our speci- 

 mens, however, presented by Dr. Ford, and subsequently described by Dr. Hal- 

 lowell as B. quadrivirgatum, and stated by him to be identical with his

The form of the body, and color of this species, bear some analogy to those 

 of the Boiga pulverulenta, just as the Boodons and Lycophidions 

 resemble the Brachycranion and Atractaspis. The subject of the pre- 

 valence of peculiar shades and arrangement of colors, throughout certain geo- 

 graphical districts, is one of much interest to the zoologist. The smoky and 

 fuscous colors of the serpents just alluded to are repeated among birds in the 

 Nectarinia fuliginosa, the genera Andropadus, Drymoeca, Artemyias, etc. 

 The Euprotodon (Lycodon) of the East Indies in the distribution and often in 

 the shade of its colors, resembles very much the venomous Bungarus and 

 Elaps (Calliophis) of the same countries. 



The Elaps of South America is represented in the same region by the black 

 and red-ringed Oxyrhopes, the Erythrolamprus, Pliocercus, Lampropeltis etc.

We have strong doubts of the propriety of retaining the name Lycodon for 

 this genus, inasmuch as Boie first proposed it for the Colubar audax Linn. 

 a species of widely different affinities. Fitzinger in the " Neue Classification" 

 removed this species to the genus Dipsas, rightly estimating the differences 

 between it and those for which he retained the name Lycodon. He afterwards 

 ("Systema Reptilium," p. 29,) made the same species the type of his genus 

 Siphlophis. Dumeril 1. c. p. 354, follows Fitzinger in the application of the 

 name Lycodon, and quotes Boie's original diagnosis as more particularly ap- 

 propriate to the C. a u 1 i c u s and congeners. As however Boie says ' ' dentes 

 colubrini" of the Psammophis and Dipsas, it must be equally appropriate to the 

 C. audax. This latter species is the type of Lycognathus /)., fam. Anisodon- 

 tiens, Opisthoglyphes. 



In deference to authority we propose no change ; but if herpetologists should 

 ever see fit to apply the name Lycodon to the Lycognathus scolopax 

 (=audax) of Dumeril, the present genus might be appropriately called 

 Euprotodon, and the subfamily Euprotodontinae.

The serpents for which we propose this name are colubrine in form, but

 side. The anterior of these is narrow, and separated from the sixth and 

 seventh labials by a broader and shorter plate, both in contact with the post- 

 oculars. The posterior is broad, and bordered by two others on its postero- 

 inferior border. 



Superior labials eight, third, fourth and fifth entering the orbit. Two post- 

 one preocular. Loreal low, elongate, acute behind, not reaching the orbit. 

 Nasal plates two, nostril large. Inferior labials ten, geneials two pair. 



Coloration. Above yellowish brown, crossed by forty-two large black spots. 

 The scales which fall in the border of each spot are absolutely black, but those 

 enclosed have a large central spot of the ground-color. The latter appears 

 above as light transverse bands one scale wide. There are seventeen spots on 

 the tail, darker than those of the body. Head above brownish black, con- 

 tinuous with the first dorsal spot. From the posterior extremity of each occi- 

 pital plate a yellowish band proceeds outwards and backwards, uniting with 

 an area of the same color which extends from the throat upon the sides of the 

 neck. In the centre of this area is a brownish black spot. Spottings of yel- 

 lowish on the temporal plates form an irregular postocular band, and another 

 equally indefinite and irregular extends from the eye round the muzzle. Su- 

 perior labials (except their edges) chin, throat, belly and under surface of tail 

 brownish yellow. The ends of the gastrosteges on the flanks, partly in- 

 cluded in a series of spots which alternate with the larger ones of the back. 

 Urosteges spotted with blackish. Gastrosteges 221 ; one entire post-abdomi- 

 nal ; urosteges 92 pair. Total length, 37 inches ; the tail 9 in. 3 lines. One 

 specimen, captured by Mr. Heine of the U. S. Japan expedition at Loo Choo, 

 presented by the Smithsonian Inst.

This serpent resembles the preceding in many point3 remarkably in the 

 dentition yet presents differences which may at some time be regarded as 

 generic. The entrance of the loral plate into the orbit, the smooth scales with 

 the vertebral series slightly larger, and the elliptic pupil, approximate it to the 

 Dinodon cancellatum Dum. & Bibr. In the palatine and superior maxil- 

 lary teeth the differences are of a kind which would be considered generic by 

 the authors of the Erpetologie Generate. In specific characters there is much 

 resemblance, but our serpent has fewer urosteges, there being 70 to 193 gas- 

 trosteges ; in the Dinodon 168 to 194. The spots above are reddish brown, not 

 Hack ; and the belly is not punctulated posteriorly. 



We at one time thought that our specimen belonged to the Lycodon rufo-

This is the genus Dipsas as understood by Giinther 1. c. We have, however, 

 not followed this author in the application of a name, since that employed by 

 him was given to auother and allied form, long previously. Some time subse- 

 quent to the first use of Dipsas,*the present genus received the barbarous ap- 

 pellation of Boiga (!). This we would gladly resign in favor of Triglyphodon 

 Dume'ril, but dates are inexorable. Vae serioribus.

 relationship to Ophiodon Dum. and Bibr. in its elongate anterior maxillaries, 

 On these peculiarities, but especially from the fact that our specimens have but 

 a single grooved tooth on each side, Dr. Hallowell proposed his genus Toxico- 

 dryas 5 . The latter character is, however, inconstant, for Fischer states that his 

 specimen had two such teeth on each side, and Dumeril, that his had three. 

 The elongation of the anterior maxillary and palatine teeth does not appear 

 to us sufficiently distinctive to afford generic characters, nor are the other 

 peculiarities of sufficient importance.

The genus Dipsas has been variously understood and defined by herpetolo- 

 gical authors. As four distinct groups have been designated by this name, in 

 order to avoid further confusion we have employed it for that to which it was 

 first applied. In the Synopsis Reptilium of Laurenti, which bears date 1768, 

 the name was first proposed, with an appropriate " character," and D. I n d i c a 

 Laur. was indicated as the typical and only species. In 1852 Dumeril made 

 the same species the type of his genus Dipsadomorus, and in 1858 Giinther 

 placed it in Leptognathus Dum. We next find the genus Dipsas characterized 

 at length by Boie in his invaluable contribution to herpetology, in the Isis von 

 Oken for 1827, and D. cenchoa assigned as the type. This species is the 

 Himantodes of Dumeril, 1852. In the Regne Animal, 1829, we find the genus 

 as proposed by Laurenti retained, and of all modern authors Cuvier is the 

 only one who does so. In 1830 the Naturlich System der Amphibien of Wagler 

 appeared. Here Dipsas dendrophila Rein, is considered typical of the 

 genus ; and in this he is followed by the great ophidiologist Schlegel, in the 

 " Essai," in 1837. The group of which this species is a typical example was 

 named Triglyphodon by Dumeril in 1852, but is the Roiga of Fitzinger, 1826. 



Fitzinger, in the Systema Reptilium, 1843, cites Dipsas cenchoa, 

 ("Weigelii") as the type of the genus, following Boie. Phillippo de Phillippi, 

 in the Catalogue of Serpents in the Museum of the University of Pavia, 1849, 

 follows Wagler and Schlegel. 



In the Prodrome de la Classification des Reptiles Ophidiens, vol. xxiii.of the 

 memoirs of the French Academy, 1852, and afterward in the Erp. Generale, 

 Dumeril considers Dipsas trigonat a the type of the genus. In 1843. 

 Fitzinger proposed Dipsadomorphus for the same species. Finally, in 1858, in 

 the Catalogue of Colubrine Snakes in the British Museum, Dr. Giinther places 

 D. multimaculata first among the species, and so characterizes the genus 

 as to be nearly coextensive with Triglyphodon, Dumeril, including also 

 Himantodes of the latter. 



Believing the genera of Dipsadinas as defined by Giinther, to be, on the 

 whole, more natural than those of other authors, we have adopted them here, 

 simply employing the name Dipsas for that called by him Leptognathus, and 

 Boiga for his Dipsas.

There is much difference in the appearance of the specimens of this species 

 which come from the extreme points of distribution represented in our collec- 

 tion, viz. Surinam and Xalapa. As has been observed by authors, those from 

 the more southern localities, have more slender bodies and tails, and hence, 

 fewer longitudinal rows of scales, and the head is more distinct. The whole 

 ' physiognomy" is more that of the arborial Dipsadiens. This is more striking 

 in a specimen where the vertebral rows of scales in places is slightly, but dis- 

 tinctly larger than the others. From the Stomach of a Surinam specimen we 

 took an adult Hyla ; from one from Caraccas, a Thecadachylus rapicaudus. 



Specimens from Mexico exhibit a stouter, heavier form of body, a greater 

 number of longitudinal rows of scales, and a shorter tail. They seldom, if ever, 

 have the dorsal spots confluent into a band, strictly speaking, as in the var. A. 

 Dum. & Bibr. Their aspect is that of a terrestrial species. 



That these forms are really distinct species, is possible, but it could only be 

 demonstrated with large series of specimens from carefully ascertained locali- 

 ties, if at all. Some of the specimens from Caraccas and Panama, are very 

 intermediate as respects the peculiarities mentioned. 



Dipsas septentrionalis Kennicott, (Mexican Boundary Survey, ii. 

 Reptiles, p. 16, pi. viii. fig. 1,) belongs to this genus. The grooving of the 

 posterior upper maxillaries is not represented in the fig. 2, pi. 22, 1. c. It 

 seems to resemble northern forms of S. annulata; but has the nasals and 

 prefrontals differently proportioned, etc. It has three preoculars but we not 

 'infrequently find one or more supplementary preoculars in the annulata.

Kotes on Coleoptera found at Fort Simpson, Mackenzie River, with remarks on 



Northern Species. 



BY JOHN L. LE CONTE, M. D. 



A small collection made at Fort Simpson, by Mr. Robert Kennicott, although 

 containing but few species, has seemed to me a convenient nucleus, about 

 which I could place certain notes derived from the study of other collec- 

 tions received from Russian America, through Prof. F. W. Maklin, and some 

 interesting specimens from Fort Jasper in the northern part of the Rocky 

 Mountains, kindly sent me by my learned friend, A. Murray, Esq., of Edin- 

 burgh. 



Species from Fort Simpson. 



Carabus Chamissonis Fischer. 



Opisthius Richardsonii Kirby. 



Platynus margin ellus, capite thoraceque nigro-piceis, hoc quadrato, 

 postice paulo angustato, et lateribus paulo sinuato, margine testaceo refiexo, 

 asi utrinque late impresso et subrugoso, angulis posticis obtusis rotundatis, 

 elytris thorace duplo latioribus, piceis, subsenescentibus, basi emarginatis, 

 striis haud punctatis, interstitio 3io pnnctis 5 vel 6 impressis, antennis piceis, 

 pedibus dilutioribus. Long. "25 *28. 



Several specimens sent. The elytra are sometimes pale, sometimes dark 

 piceous ; the intervals between the striae are rarely flat, usually moderately 

 convex ; the impressed punctures are tolerably large ; the under surface is 

 piceous, the base of the antenna? and feet paler. This species resembles 

 P. anchomenoides more nearly than any other species in my col- 

 lection, but the thorax is more narrowed behind, with the margin narrowly 

 reflexed, and the sides somewhat sinuate towards the posterior angles. The 

 posterior transverse impression of the thorax is well marked, and the dorsal 

 line distinct. 



Pterostichus mandibularis; specimens in no wise differing from other 55 

 found by me at Lake Superior, were sent me by Mr. Kennicott. The specie 8 

 is very closely allied to Cryobius fastidiosus Mann, from Russian America, 

 but differs by the thorax being broader, with the sides more suddenly and 

 more distinctly sinuate at the posterior angles. 



Pterostichus Luczotii Lee. (Feronia Lucz. Dej. ; F. obJongonotata Say). 

 One specimen not differing from those found at Lake Superior. 



Pterostichus 6-pun ct at u s Mann, Two specimens quite similar to those 

 from Russian America.

 specimen from Lake Superior, were found at Fort Simpson and also on the 

 Saskatchewan. The thorax is, however, somewhat less narrowed behind, and 

 the apex is sparsely punctured. 



Amara (Leirus) obtusaZec, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 7, 348. Amara Esch- 

 scholtzii Mann. Bull. Mosc. 1852, 297. The specimens sent by Mr. Kennicott are 

 larger than the one sent me by Mr. Motsclmlsky from Russian America, but do 

 not otherwise differ. It is perhaps Curtonotus lat i or Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 

 36, but the descriptions of the species of this genus by Kirby are so indefinite 

 that reference must be had to the original specimens to determine the 

 synonymy. 



Amara (Celia) interstitialis Dej. 



Bembidium n i t e n s Lee. ; Peryphus picipes % Mann. Precisely similar to the 

 specimens from Lake Superior, and Kadjak. 



Bembidium nigripes; Notaphus nigripes Kirby, Fauna Bor. Am. 57. This 

 species is similar in size and form toB. variegatum and B. patruele, 

 but differs by the feet and antennae being black, with the first joint of the latter 

 testaceous beneath. The striae of the elytra are also less deep, and more 

 finely punctured. The size is smaller than required by the description of 

 Kirby, but the color of the feet is so characteristic, that I can scarcely avoid 

 considering it as his species. Notaphus quadraticollis Mann. Bull. 

 Mosc. 1853, 148, is probably the same. The Russian American one described as 

 B. n i g r i p e s by Mannerheim, is totally different, being much larger, with the 

 pale bands of the elytra very badly defined, and the epipleurae pale, resembling 

 these characters B. indistinctum Dej., from California; it differs, how- 

 ever, from that species by the thorax being more strongly margined, with the 

 posterior angles more rectangular and prominent, and the basal carinae very 

 distinct ; the dorsal line and impressions are likewise deeper. In all these 

 respects it agrees with B. approximatum Lee. , but differs by the punc- 

 tures of the elytral striae being larger and less closely placed. The femora are 

 dark: in B. appr ox i m at um the legs are usually pale, though some- 

 times dark, in B. indistinctum they are always pale. The species will 

 hereafter be known asB. incrematum; it differs from all the allied species 

 by the 7th elytral stria being obliterated and represented only by punctures. 



Bembidium nitidum Lee. ; Eudromus nilidus Kirby; a specimen pre- 

 cisely similar to one found by me in the Platte River valley. Bembidium 

 breve Mann., Bull. Mosc. 1852, 301, is closely allied to this species, and 

 on comparison may be found to be identical.

 Oregon and the Atlantic States. I am therefore strongly inclined to doubt 

 the specific value of the Russian American, R. investigator Mann. (Bull. 

 Mosc. 1852, 367) ; the characters given by him as distinguishing it are partly 

 individual and partly sexual.

Haltica bimarginata Say. The difference between this and Graptodera 

 plicipennis Mann, is not obvious on comparison. The species is abundant in 

 Kanzas, California, Oregon, and at Fort Simpson.

 the thorax being more transverse and somewhat narrowed in front.

Notes on Russian American Species. 



Calathus lenis. Anchomenus lenis Mann. I referred this species formerly 

 to Pristodactyla, but think that there is not sufficient reason for retaining the 

 latter genus. The present species is closely allied to C. ad vena Schaum, 

 Ins. Deutschl. 1, 389, (Pristodactyla advena Lee.) from Lake Superior, and 

 Maine, but in the latter the sides of the thorax are slightly sinuate behind, 

 whereby the posterior angles become less rounded ; among the specimens 

 found by me at Lake Superior is, however, one which does not differ in this 

 respect, and which appears entirely similar to the specimens fromKadjak. 



Schaum's statement from Chaudoir (1. c.) that Pristodactyla differs from 

 Calathus by the absence of furrows on the outer surface of the four posterior 

 tarsi is not correct. Of the specimens of P. impunctatain my collection 

 one has the groove very strongly marked ; three have it distinct, though not 

 deep, while in the two others it is wanting : of the two specimens referred by 

 me to P. corvina Lee, the groove is obsolete in one, and wanting in the 

 other. From these facts I draw two inferences : 



1. The genus Pristodactyla is to be suppressed. 



2. Many of the species of Calathus as at present recognized, are too indis- 

 tinct for systematic purposes, and are to be considered as races clustering 

 around a few principal forms. The species of North America may be arranged 

 as follows : 



A. Thorax postice haud angustatus, foveis basalibus obsoletis. 



1. Corpus elongatum, thorace latitudine haud brevoire, lateribus modice 

 reflexis. C. gregarius Dej. 



2. Corpus elongatum, thorace latitudine haud breviore, lateribus anguste 

 marginatis. C. ing r at u s Dej. ; C. incommodus Mann, (Russ. Am.) and C. 

 confusus Lee. (Lake Superior), are almost imperceptible races of this species. 



3. Corpus elongatum, elytris subopacis, thorace latitudine haud breviore, 

 lateribus modice explanatis. C. opaculus Lee. 



4. Corpus elongatum, elytris subopacis thorace latitudine haud breviore, 

 antrorsum vix angustato, lateribus parum rotundatis vix explanatis. C. 

 quadricollis Lee. 



5. Corpus minus elongatum, elytris subopacis, thorace latitudine breviore, 

 lateribus valde rotundatis explanatis. C. Behrensii Mann. 



6. Corpus minus elongatum, elytris subopacis, thorace latitudine breviore, 

 antrorsum sensim angustato, lateribus parum rotundatis, explanatis. C. 

 obscurus Lee. 



7. Corpus minus elongatum, elytris subopacis, thorace latitudine breviore, 

 lateribus valde rotundatis vix explanatis. L. ruficollis Dej.

 a race of C. mollis, though this is merely a conjecture on my part, as I 

 have never seen a specimen of it.

Trechus spectabilis Mann, and T. oblongulus Mann., are by no 

 means Trechus, but belong to Bembidium, forming a group between VIII. and 

 IX. (Proc. Acad. 1857, 4), characterized by the thorax subcordate, with the 

 basal fovese somewhat double, the elytral striae deep, the outer ones scarcely 

 abbreviated, the base of the antenna? and the feet pale ; the last joint of the 

 palpi is longer than in the neighboring groups, but acicular and not at all 

 conical. 



Euplectus parviceps Maklin, belongs to Faronus Aube. 



Corymbites caricinus Esch. = C. telum Lee. 



Cryptohypnus fall ax Mann. From this species C. picescens Lee, 

 found at Lake Superior, seems scarcely to differ ; in the latter, however, the 

 punctures are a little stronger, and the size somewhat larger, but hardly suf- 

 ficient to establish a specific difference. The names were both published in 

 1853, but that of Mannerheim has priority by a few months, 



Rhagonycha binodula Mann, does not differ from Telephorus f r a x i n i 

 Lee. (Cantharis fraxini Say, Telephorus nigrita Lee), which is very abundant 

 at Lake Superior, and is found also in Pennsylvania.

Saskatchewan. In sculpture resembles C. moniliatum Lee. and C. can- 

 nellatum Esch.; the former has the thorax much more strongly punctured 

 and the elytra oblong oval, and much narrower ; the latter is winged, and has 

 the posterior angles of the thorax less prolonged and broadly rounded, and 

 the elytra more convex, with the sides less rounded. 



Nebria m o e s t a Lee. I have received from Russian America two species 

 under the name N. Mannerheimii Fischer. The one, received from Baron 

 Chaudoir and Count Mnizech, has the sides of the thorax moderately rounded, 

 with the posterior angles rectangular and not very prominent ; the stria? of the 

 dytra appear smooth, and the outer ones are less impressed at the tip. This

I take to be the true species. The other, received from Mr. Motschulsky, ha! 

 the thorax broader, more rounded on the sides, with the posterior angles very 

 prominent, precisely as in N. m e t a 1 1 i c a ; the striae of the elytra are scarcely 

 less deep at the tip than at the base ; this specimen agrees perfectly with 

 those of N. m o e s t a, found by me on the north shore of Lake Superior. I 

 have also a specimen from Oregon, and several were collected by Mr. Barnston 

 at Carlton House, Saskatchewan River. 



Platynus corvus, niger, nitidus, thorace latitudine breviore, lateribus

Black Hills, Dr. Hammond ; Saskatchewan. By the form of the thorax this 

 species exactly resembles P. atratus Lee, except that it is a little broader. 

 The elytra are, however, broader, less convex, and more emarginate at the 

 base. The size is one half larger.

 yellow, with the tip black. The thighs are yellow at the base, gradually be- 

 coming dark at the tip. 



Teicrania Lee. 



Under this generic name I would separate the North American species allied to 

 Horia. The genus has been indicated, but not named by Lacordaire, (Gen. Col. 

 5, 664, note), and differs from Horia by the triangular head; by the obconical, 

 scarcely compressed joints of the antennae ; by the mandibles not being 

 toothed; by the last joint of the palpi being somewhat longer than the 

 penultimate, (in Horia the last joint is much shorter) ; and by the posterior 

 tarsi one-half shorter than the tibiae. The body is also somewhat hairy, 

 while in Horia it is glabrous. Three species are known to me, forming two 

 divisions.

Rocky Mountains or Oregon. Of the size and shape ofT. Stansburii, 

 but differs by the head and thorax being more finely and densely punctured: 

 the latter is also more transverse, and the sides converge slightly behind, 

 while in the other they are parallel. I take great pleasure in dedicating this 

 fine species to my learned friend, Andrew Murray, to whose liberality I owe 

 this and many other valuable additions to my collection.

Synopsis of the Scaphidiidas of the United States. 



BY JOHN L. LE CONTE. M. D. 



Several years ago I wrote a synopsis of our species of the family of Coleopter- 

 ous insects here treated of, but the manuscript having been lost by the printer, 

 was not published. I have recently had occasion to study again this group, 

 and therefore now make known the species in my collection. The native 

 genera may be arranged in the following manner :

Description of a New Species of CEPHALOPOD, from the Eocene of Texas. 



BY WM. M. GABB. 



Sepia (Belosepia) ungula . Shell laterally compressed, especially poste- 

 riorly ; beak robust, acute, arcuate, and with a very faint ridge on the dorsal 

 surface ; ventral plate smaller in proportion than in tbe other species of this 

 subgenus, slightly undulate and radiate, edge smooth and sharp; dorsal cal- 

 lus straight, deeply rugose, marked by about three irregular rugse, and co- 

 vered on the face and sides with pits or cavities, which extend on the sides 

 almost to the base of the ventral plate, becoming gradually fainter until they 

 disappear; cavity shallow, ventral edge sharp, interior marked by numerous 

 compound concentric ribs crossed by very faint longitudinal lines. 



Length lj in.; length of rostrum f in. ; width of ventral plate J in., just above 

 the base of the cavity. 



Locality and position, Wheelock, Texas ; from a deposit containing many 

 species found at Claiborne, Ala. 



This species resembles more nearly Sepia Cuvieri Desk., of the Paris 

 basin than any other, but it can readily be distinguished from it by the dorsal 

 callosity, which, in our species, is not so prominent, and is comparatively sharp, 

 especially towards the extremity nearest the rostrum. The roughening of the 

 surface of the same portion is, in the Paris species, transverse, while in ours it 

 is longitudinal. The ventral plate is one-third smaller in. the present species than 

 in S. Cuvieri. 



The type of this species belongs to the Smithsonian Institution. 



A letter from Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger, dated Philadelphia,

Descriptions of new species of American Fresh-water Fishes. 



BY CHARLES C. ABBOTT. 



1. Plargyrus melanocephalu s Abbott. Head large, broad ; snout 

 very blunt. Body broad anterior to dorsal fin, rapidly narrowing posteriorly ; 

 dorsal outline greatly curved, making the depth of the body anterior to dor- 

 sal fin equal to one-fourth of total length. The eye large, circular ; diameter 

 equal to one-third the width of head. The distance from the posterior mar- 

 gin of opercular apparatus to edge of the orbit, is double that from extremity 

 of the snout to opposite edge of orbit. The nostrils, which have a double 

 opening, are situated on a line with the upper edge of the orbits. The mouth 

 is of medium size, terminal, the lower jaw the shorter. Small corneal, acute 

 cornua arranged on the snout, generally in parallel rows ; a few on the lower 

 jaw, irregularly placed. The lateral line, commencing at angle of operculum, 

 is greatly decurved, approaching nearer the ventral than dorsal outline, 

 posteriorly. The anterior ray of the ventral fin directly opposite that of the 

 ventral fin, each ray being equidistant from the snout and base of caudal 

 fin. The tips of the rays of the ventral somewhat overlap the anus. The 

 dorsal fin is higher than broad, quadrangular ; caudal finis slightly bifurcated :

pectorals long, narrow and subqnadrangular, the ventrals long, narrow and 

 tapering ; anal twice as long as broad, quadrangular. 



7 



The fin-rays are D, 9. C, 20 - P, 14. V, 8. A, 7. 



7 



Color. In alcoholic specimens, the whole head, posteriorly to the nape of 

 the neck, inky black. The opercle occasionally with a metallic reflection. A 

 black narrow band extends from opercle to caudal fin, above lateral line 

 anterior and below, posterior to dorsal fin. Body of a general gray hue, 

 darker on the back, and yellowish on the belly. A narrow black line on 

 peduncle of tail. 



Total length 2 inches. 



The specimens from which the description is taken, were procured by Dr. 

 .T. H. Slack, of Philadelphia, in June, 1860, at Lake Whittlesey, Minnesota. 

 From the number of specimens obtained, it is natural to suppose that it is, 

 in that district at least, a very numerous species. 



2. Cottus C opei Abbott. Body subcylindrical ; its greatest depth is con- 

 tained six times in the entire length from snout to tip of caudal fin ; and the 

 least depth, at insertion of caudal fin, is contained thirteen times in the 

 entire length. Head twice as broad as deep, with its frontal length equal to 

 its width. The snout is obtuse. A vertical line drawn upwards, from the angle 

 of the mouth would pass anterior to the pupil. The eyes are circular, 

 medium sized, and the diameter is contained little more than four times in 

 the length of the head. The preopercular spine is strongly developed, curving 

 slightly upwards. A small acute spine on the subopercle. The gill openings 

 are oblique, large and separated under the throat by an isthmus of three- 

 eighths of an inch. The lateral line is distinct throughout its course ; it is 

 concurrent with the dorsal outline. The first ray of the dorsal is inserted 

 fifteen-sixteenths of an inch from the extremity of the snout, and extends on 

 a basis of one-third of an inch ; the origin of second dorsal is posterior to the 

 vent, the first and last rays shorter than the middle ones. The commence- 

 ment of anal fin is opposite the third ray of dorsal. The caudal fin is rounded 

 X>osteriorly, and is contained six times in the entire length ; the middle rays 

 are bifurcated. The ventrals are inserted in a line with the centre of the in- 

 sertion of pectorals ; the tips of rays do not reach the anus, if bent backward. 

 The bases of the pectorals are crescent shaped, and the tips of the rays, if 

 bended backward, will reach the first ray of second dorsal, but not the anal 

 fin. 



The number of fin rays are D, 715. P, 12. V, 8. C,"14. A, 10. 



Color. Head and back of a varied blackish-gray, with minute yellow spots ; 

 sides yellowish-gray, fading to pearly white on the belly ; sides marked with 

 very irregular dark gray lines. The fins partaking the color of the region to 

 which they belong, are sparingly dotted with deep black. Iris bronze. 

 Total length 3f inches. 



Habitat. A small trout stream, a tributary of a tributary of Brandywine 

 creek, Chester Co., Pennsylvania. But one adult and one young specimen 

 captured. 



I dedicate, with much pleasure, this beautiful Cottus, to Mr. E. D. Cope, of 

 Philadelphia, by whom it was found, and kindly loaned me for description. 



PCECILOSOMA, Agass. 

 Gen. Char. Head short and strong, rounded. Mouth little opened, pro- 

 portionately broad ; it is not protractile, though the maxillary bone be move- 

 able ; opercular apparatus scaly ; cheeks bare. 



3. P. transversum Abbott. Head and body compressed ; nose acute. 

 Operculum terminating in a spine posteriorly. Jaws equal ; mouth broad. 

 Margin of jaws armed with very numerous, small, inwardly curved, sharp 

 teeth. The origin of the first dorsal fin is posterior to the insertion of pectoral

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



fin ; the ventral is also posterior to the pectoral, and is slightly anterior to 

 the first ray of dorsal. The origin of the second dorsal is situated slightly 

 posteriorly to the vent, and directly opposite the origin of the anal ; the ter- 

 minal ray of the anal is anterior to the terminal "ray of second dorsal. The 

 caudal fin is slightly rounded. 



5 



The numbers of the fin rays, are D ; 1112. C, 16 - A, 9. V, 6. P, 11. 



5 



Total length. 2 inches. 



Color. In alcoholic specimens, the general tint of the body is sienna, fading 

 into pale straw color upon the belly ; throat orange ; pectoral and ventral fins 

 orange ; the other fins partake of the color of the region to which they belong. 

 Fourteen bands of dark rufous, joined upon the back, cross the sides trans- 

 versely, and become obliterated upon the belly ; the intervening spaces are 

 double the width of the bands. 



Habitat. Cabinet of Academy ? Lake Snperior. 



A few specimens of this fish, with specimens also of a new species of 

 Pileoma DeKay, were presented by W. A. Hammond, M. D., to the Acad- 

 emy ; but the locality and date of presentation have been lost, and no 

 mention of the fish being presented is made in the '-Proceedings." The 

 only other described representative of this g*'nus is the P. zebra Agassi:, 

 described in his work on Lake Superior, as a fish of those waters. This new 

 species may be from the same locality, but at present there is no means of 

 positively ascertaining. 



4. Pileoma cymatogramma Abbott. Body cylindrical, slightly de- 

 pressed. Head small, facial outline oblique ; mouth rather large. The eye 

 is situated near the top of the head, with the diameter of the orbit equal to one- 

 third of the length of the head. The operculum terminates posteriorly in a 

 broad flat point ; the preopercle terminates posteriorly in a small, very acute 

 and conical spine. The lateral line is nearly straight throughout -its course. 

 The insertion of the pectoral fin is anterior to that of the ventral, and that of 

 the ventral anterior to the origin of dorsal. The origin of the second dorsal 

 is opposite the primary ray of the anal fin. The caudal is slightly bifurca- 

 ted. 



4 



The numbers of the fin rays are D, 1312. C. 16 - P, 13. V, 7. A, 8.

Color. In alcohol specimens, the general color of the upper surface, light 

 rufous, fading on the belly. A broad, wavy band, mostly below the lateral 

 line, of dark rufous-brown. Numerous quadrangular, dark rufous spots on 

 the back and sides above the lateral line. 



Habitat. Cabinet of the Academy. 



This genus differs principally from Poecilosoma, in having the cheeks and 

 opercular apparatus, both scaly. 



5. Ammoccetes aep y ptera Abbott. Body posterior to second branchial 

 aperture, compressed and tapering rapidly towards the tail ; belly, anterior 

 to the vent, flattened. The first dorsal fin arises somewhat posteriorly to the 

 centre of the entire length of the body, and is pyramuial in figure. The 

 second dorsal fin, joining with the caudal, is smaller than the first dorsal and 

 more acutely pyramidal in its figure. The caudal, whose origin is situated 

 opposite the vent, is higher than either dorsal fin, and decreases rapidly 

 towards the tail. Nape of the neck nmch elevated, and the facial outline 

 obliquely descending. Snout exceedingly prolonged ; mouth circular ; on the 

 inside of the upper lip there are three or four very small granules on each 

 side ; and at the opening of the throat small ramified papillae. The eyes are 

 very small and situated near the top of the head, equidistant between the 

 first branchial aperture and the angle of the mouth. The branchial apertures 



I860.] 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



are situated in a longitudinal depression, oblique and slightly curved ; the 

 first aperture is situated in a line with the pupil, and is one-fifth of an inch 

 distant posteriorly. 



Total length, 5.} inches. 



Color. In the alcoholic specimen, the head, back and sides are dark brown ; 

 the belly, clay color. Fins yellow. 

 Habitat. Ohio River. 



A single specimen of this new species of Ammoccetes, is in the cabinet of the 

 Academy, marked as procured in the Ohio River, and presented by Dr. Hil- 

 dreth. The peculiarities of the species are to be noticed in the remarkable 

 length of the head, and distance from the orbit to the first branchial aperture, 

 and also in the unusual size of the dorsal and caudal fins ; from which last 

 peculiarity the specific name is derived.

 Under jaws spotted. A yellowish occipital ring one and a half or two scales 

 wide. 



Descr. Form moderately slender. Head rather narrow, with the crown 

 slightly arched ; snout narrow and depressed. Vertical plate small, tapering 

 posteriorly ; superior labials seven. Eye proportionally large. Outer row of 

 dorsal scales slightly the largest. Color above leaden or bluish black, the 

 crown darker. AsinD. punctatus, the edges of the upper labial shields 

 are yellow, like the lower, but the latter are thickly spotted with black. The 

 abdomen is usually irregularly spotted with tlack over its whole surface, 

 though in some specimens there is a tendency to form a medial row as in D. 

 punctatus. The under surface of the tail is tinged with reddish.

This will be distinguished from D. punctatus by its more slender form, 

 arched crown and narrow snout, by the numerous and irregular spots on the 

 abdomen, and especially those on the mandibular and mental plates.

 L. kultistriata Kennicott. 

 Sp. char. Dorsal scales in twenty-three rows. Form similar to that of L.

gentilis, but the head and eye larger. Color above brownish red, with 

 thirty-one pairs of narrow black half-rings enclosing white spaces, from head 

 to anus. The black rings not extending across the abdomen, which is uni- 

 form yellowish white. Head black above. 



Descr. Snout broader and more depressed than in L. g e n t i 1 i s . It 3s 

 also more elongate, and hence, also, the loreal and nasal plates ; in the only 

 specimen examined the second superior labial plate is replaced by two smaller 

 ones, thus increasing the number to eight, a peculiarity probably abnormal, 

 as all the other species of the genus have seven. The body above is brownish 

 red in spirits, crossed by thirty-one pairs of black rings from head to anus. 

 The enclosed white spaces are one and a half scales wide on the central fifteen 

 dorsal rows, and begin to widen abruptly on the fourth lateral row on each 

 side, extending over three or four scales longitudinally on the first row. On 

 the sides they are punctulated with black as in L. g e n t i 1 i s . The occipital 

 white ring is much broader. The black rings are each two scales wide on the 

 vertebral region, narrowing to less than one scale laterally. On the fourth 

 lateral row the two rings of each pair begin to diverge, the anterior uniting 

 on the edge of the abdomen with the posterior ring of the pair in advance, the 

 posterior becoming confluent with the anterior of the succeeding pair. Thus 

 the ground color is enclosed in the form of a transverse elliptical spot. Upon 

 the middle of the body these spots are two or three scales wide on the verte- 

 bral region, four or five on the sides, and but one on the first row of scales. 

 Anteriorly the red intervals are greater ; posteriorly they narrow slightly, but 

 toward the tip of the tail they are entirely lost, as in L. doliatus and 

 gentilis, by the confluence of the black rings. The black rings extend 

 but a short distance upon the abdominal scuta, leaving the abdomen destitute 

 of blotches, though it is faintly and sparsely punctulated. The chin and in- 

 ferior labials are tinged with brown. The top of the head is black as in L. 

 gentilis. 



No. 1842, Fort Lookout, Nebraska. Lieut. Warren and Dr. Hayden. 



The number of rows of scales and the more numerous rings will distinguish 

 this species from L. annulatus, and those above compared with it. 



L. annulata Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Form stout, head broad, eye small. Scales short and broad. 

 Color bright red, with eighteen to twenty-two pairs of black rings from head 

 to anus, each pair enclosing an immaculate yellow ring which completely en- 

 circles the body, widening but little upon the flanks. Abdomen between the 

 yellow rings black. Top of head entirely black, this color extending posteri- 

 orly upon the occipitals in an acute angle. A broad occipital yellow ring. 



Descr. General appearance similar to L. gentilis. The form is stouter, 

 the head shorter, broader and more depressed, and the eye smaller. The 

 dorsal scales are very different, being much broader; the lateral rows in L. 

 annulatus, are higher than long, and those of the central are nearly as 

 wide as long. InL. gentilis, those of the lateral rows are considerably 

 longer than high, and those of the central nearly twice as long as wide. There 

 are twenty pairs of black rings from head to vent, which do not diverge on 

 the sides ; each ring covering two to two and a half scales longitudinally on 

 the vertebral region and narrowing but little laterally. The enclosed yellow 

 rings are one and a half scales wide on the vertebral region. The first three pairs 

 of black rings behind the head are, with those enclosed, a little wider. The 

 intervals of red ground-color occupy four or five scales on the middle of the 

 body, and one or two more anteriorly and posteriorly. The yellow rings are 

 of nearly uniform width, and completely surround the body. The spaces be- 

 tween them on the abdomen are black. There are no black spots upon the 

 body.

A small specimen from Brownsville, Texas, (No. 1855), with twenty-one 

 pairs of black rings from head to anus, has the yellow rings rather wider on 

 the abdomen, though not two scales wide on the first dorsal row, and the 

 black rings distinct ; the enclosed abdominal intervals are only black along 

 the middle. Otherwise similar to the above.

 Mountains, i. p. 140, 1823 ; not Coluber obsoletus "Say," Holbrook, Am. 

 Herp. iii. 1842, p. 61. 

 Spec. char. Head broad behind, tapering anteriorly, snout more pointed 

 than in S. Allegheniensis. Head much more elevated anteriorly. Na- 

 sals, loral, anteorbital, and anterior upper labials elevated. Vertical large 

 anteriorly, nearly as broad as long. Superciliaries and occipitals large. Scales 

 in twenty-five or seven rows, the central ones moderately carinated. Color 

 above entirely black, with a slight bluish olive tinge. Upon stretching the 

 skin, the spaces between the scales seem to be red. Abdomen light bluish 

 slate posteriorly ; anteriorly, yellowish, clouded with bluish slate, lighter than 

 inS. Allegheniensis. 



Deter. This species resembles S. Allegheniensis very closely, ren- 

 dering a comparative description necessary. Head broad behind, more elon- 

 gate and elevated in front than in S. Allegheniensis, hence the occipitals 

 are larger, and the nasals, loral, preocular, and anterior upper labials are 

 more elevated. The anterior frontals are smaller, though the external poste- 

 rior angles are more elongated ; the anteorbital is narrower. Posterior orbi- 

 tals rather larger ; vertical large, anterior breadth nearly equal to the length. 

 Pour or five external rows of scales smooth, the first largest, with the scales 

 less obtuse than in S. Allegheniensis. The head and entire upper 

 parts are uniform black, not pitchy as in S. Allegheniensis, but with a 

 slight tinge of olivaceous or brown. Upon stretching the skin the spaces be- 

 tween the scales and sometimes the covered bases of the latter are seen to be 

 of a bright reddish brown on the sides, and in bars across the back, enclosing 

 a vertebral series of pure black spaces which are analogous to the dorsal spots 

 sometimes seen in S. Allegheniensis. No trace of these markings is to 

 be seen in our specimens of the present species without stretching the skin, 

 though one of them is but about three feet in length. 



The abdomen is much lighter than in S. Allegheniensis; the posterior 

 space occupied by the light bluish slate color is less. Along the middle third 

 it is yellowish, heavily clouded with bluish slate, and anteriorly it is yellow, 

 with irregular clouded spots of bluish slate along the sides. These anterior 

 markings are much smaller than in Allegheniensis, and never in large 

 square blotches as in that species. 



Though so closely allied to Allegheniensis as not to be readily dis- 

 tinguished by absolute characters, except in the red spaces between the scales, 

 the differences in the form of the head, and generally lighter colors, will be 

 apparent at once upon comparison. 



Independence, Mo. Dr. J. G. Cooper. 



EUTiENIA Baird & Girard. 

 E. megalops Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Form shorter and stouter, with proportionally shorter tail than 

 in E. proxima, which this species resembles. Tail one-fourth of the total 

 length. Eye very large, greater than in E. proxima. First dorsal row of 

 scales broader, each scale as high as long, and less strongly carinate. Dorsal 

 stripe narrow, covering one and less than two half rows of scales. Color 

 uniform brownish ash, with the three longitudinal stripes whitish yellow. 

 Head olive ash. 



Descr. Color uniform dull brownish ash or clay color, with the dorsal and 



[Aug.

lateral stripes whitish yellow. A few of the scales have narrow black spots on 

 their edges, but these are not prominent, and never extend over a scale, ap- 

 pearing as indistinct mottlings of black on the ground color, always on the 

 rows nest the stripes. The head above is light olive ash. The lateral stripe 

 is on the third and fourth rows, and is narrower than in E. p r o x i m a , cov- 

 ering rather less than two half scales. The color below the lateral stripe is a 

 little lighter than that of the back. The exterior dorsal row is much wider 

 than in any of the allied species, each scale being as high as long. The second 

 row is much narrower, though a little wider than the third. The eye is strik- 

 iiigly large, and the superciliaries are raised, rendering the fore part of the 

 crown an inclined plane, yet the muzzle is higher than in E. proxima. 



No. 965, Tucson and St. Magdalena, 160, 86, 21, 24, 6. Major Emory. A. 

 Schott. 



E. mackostemma Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Twenty-one rows of scales. Body rather stout. Head small, 

 narrow posteriorly. Vertical plate much elongated, twice as long as wide. 

 Eight upper labials, sixth largest, seventh sometimes equal. All the dorsal 

 scales broad and short, first row largest, its scales as high as long and slightly 

 carinate ; second smaller, but much broader than the third. Ground color 

 above very dull yellowish brown. Dorsal stripe broad, light brownish, but 

 little lighter than the ground color, and with an indistinct black border. La- 

 teral stripe on the fourth and part of the third row, indistinct, dull yellowish 

 green. Two series of indistinct broken spots along the second and sixth 

 rows. 



Descr. The dorsal stripe is broad and regular, covering nearly three rows, 

 but is dull and indistinct. On each side of it for one and a half scales there 

 is a rather indistinct black border, somewhat as in E. ordinoides. Below 

 this to the fourth row the color is dull greenish brown. On the fifth and sixth 

 rows there is a series of indistinct black spots, each covering three scales, 

 whose keels are of the ground color. This is also the case with the scales in 

 the black border of the dorsal stripe. The lateral spots are one and a half 

 scales wide, and separated by spaces of the same width. The third and fourth 

 rows, particularly the fourth, are lighter, and of a yellowish green or olive 

 color ; the first and second and lower edge of third being a little darker, suffi- 

 ciently define the lateral stripe. On about every other scale of the second 

 row is a series of broken and irregular black spots, formed by the black mar- 

 gin of each side of the scales ; extremely slight as to the contiguous scales. 

 Each abdominal scutum is distinctly edged with black anteriorly, (of course 

 concealed by the incumbent scutum), and some are tipped with black at their 

 extremities, otherwise the abdomen is immaculate. In one specimen it is 

 uniform dark green ; in another, uniform yellowish green. The head is dark 

 brown above, the superior labials but little lighter, and narrowly bordered 

 with black posteriorly. 



One specimen, upon the removal of the epidermis, appears entirely of a 

 pale creamy yellow throughout, but with the black markings, including the 

 border of the dorsal stripe, very distinct. Another specimen is green instead 

 of whitish yellow. 



City of Mexico. Maj. W. Rich. 



This is a very well marked species, and readily distinguished. In color it 

 bears some resemblance to some varieties of E. ordinoides and d o r s a - 

 lis, but it belongs to a different section of the genus, as indicated by the 

 position of the lateral stripe. It is otherwise different from E. ordinoides, 

 in having a very much smaller head and larger vertical phite, the dorsal 

 scales wider, and the stripe more indistinct. From E. Marciana it differs 

 in its very much smaller head and longer vertical plate, in its broader dorsal 

 band, bordered by a stripe instead of a row of spots, and in the absence of 

 the post oral crescentic patch, and broad black borders of upper labials.

 Head very narrow and much elongated ; the snout very narrow, but rather 

 obtuse. The back above the third row of scales is very dark uniform olive 

 brown without spot or band, except a light medial line extending about an 

 inch back of the head. Lateral stripe light olivaceous yellow ; first row of 

 scales a little darker, and similar to the abdomen, being of a very dull whitish 

 olive. Bases of the scales of the first row black ; bases of abdominal scutes 

 the same, the color broader toward their extremities, and generally concealed 

 by the incumbent scute. A narrow slate-colored line along the middle of the 

 abdomen posteriorly. Head above dark olive ; superior labials very light 

 olive yellow, margined with black posteriorly, excepting the eighth. This is 

 black anteriorly, its posterior end being occupied by a yellowish patch which 

 is confluent with the yellow of the neck. Lower postorbitals yellow. Two 

 small yellow occipital dots, and a small yellow dot on each side of the poste- 

 rior part of the vertical plate ; these sometimes absent. 



Youus? specimens, and older ones, after the removal of the epidermis, ex- 

 hibit faint indications of a very narrow dorsal stripe upon a single row of 

 scales, but in one there is no trace of this, even upon the neck, where it is 

 usually visible These specimens also exhibit traces of two series of large 

 alternating spots, which present somewhat the appearance of a zigzag line. In 

 a young specimen there is a distinct series of spots on the first dorsal row, 

 each spot covering one scale, and separated from those adjacent by two scales. 

 Only one specimen is without the dark line upon the abdomen posteriorly. 

 There are no irregular black blotches upon the abdomen as in E. angusti- 

 r os tr is .

This species is strongly marked, and will hardly be confounded with any 

 at present known. It resembles most nearly E. ang u s tir ostri s , under 

 the head of which species the comparative differences are given in full. Two 

 young specimens labelled by Dr. Hallowell " Tropidonotus ordinatus," belong 

 here. Eutsenia ordinata has a stouter body and head, and more pointed 

 snout. There are nineteen dorsal rows, and a very different system of colora- 

 tion. 



E. angustirostris Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Body moderately stout ; tail less than one-fourth the total 

 length, and very small. Head exceedingly elongated and narrow, more so 

 than any other of the genus ; snout very long, narrow and pointed. Crown 

 plane above ; eye large. Upper labials eight, sixth largest, seventh scarcely 

 smaller. Dorsal rows twenty-one ; outer row large, very faintly carinated, 

 the second smaller but broader than the third ; the next rather large and 

 elongated, and strongly carinated. Dorsal stripe narrow, very indistinct. An 

 indistinct, dull whitish lateral stripe on the second and third rows. Above 

 the lateral stripes dark olive brown or black. Abdomen dark ashy olive or 

 black. 



Descr. The back above the third row of scales is dark olive brown without 

 spots, but with each scale bordered with darker. The scales of the second 

 and third rows are greyish olive, with distinct yellow borders. The first row 

 and abdomen are ashy olive, with irregular heavy black blotches upon the 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 333 



latter, more numerous along the middle third, but offering no indication of a 

 narrow black line as in E. Hammondii. On the first three rows some 

 scattered scales have black spots on their bases and edges. Head above dark 

 olive ; upper labials light olive with vertical black edgings. 



A young specimen is entirely black ; the dorsal stripe obsolete, being indi- 

 cated only by a faint line on a single row of scales ; the lateral stripes very 

 indistinct ; the first and part of the second row of scales entirely black. A 

 whitish line along each side of the abdomen formed by a white spot at the 

 end of each scute. These are also margined posteriorly with the same color. 

 Throat whitish. 



The remarkable elongation of the snout will distinguish this species from 

 any others at present known, excepting E. leptocephala and Ham- 

 mondii, from which it differs in other respects. The snout is more elon- 

 gated, and decidedly more pointed than in either ; the head is not at all de- 

 pressed anteriorly asinB. leptocephala, and the eye is strikingly larger. 

 The colors of the back and abdomen are darker, and the rows of scales are 

 twenty-one, not nineteen. As compared with E. Hammondii, which it 

 most nearly resembles, beside the difference in the form of the snout, the head 

 is depressed posteriorly (not anteriorly); hence the crown is quite plane 

 throughout, while in E. Hammondii the crown is somewhat arched, 

 this form being more observable upon the occipital and frontal (vertical) re- 

 gion. In angustirostris the general form is stouter, while the head is 

 longer, and hence a greater elongation of the vertical and frontal plates. The 

 scales of the upper rows are also larger and more elongated, and more strongly 

 carinate. The tail is shorter, being considerably less than one-fourth the to- 

 tal length, while in Hammondii it is fully or more than one-fourth. This 

 member is also very slender, the body tapering abruptly near the anus in the 

 former species. The dorsal stripe, though narrow, is not wanting, and the 

 abdomen is much darker, being ashy olive with heavy black blotches through- 

 out instead of light yellow or greyish olive, and there is no indication of the 

 central line. The young black specimen is strikingly different from the young 

 ofE. Hammondii. 



Parras, Coahuila, Mexico. Lieut. Couch. 



E. cyrtopsis Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Form very slender, but little stouter than that of E. s a u r i t a, 

 but with shorter tail, one-fourth the total length. Head large. Eye very 

 large. Superior labials eight, sixth and seventh largest. Three postorbitals, 

 upper much the largest. Scales in nineteen rows. Color above olive brown, 

 with two alternating series of elongated spots between the stripes, giving the 

 appearance of a zigzag line. Dorsal stripe whitish, narrow, distinct to the 

 tip of the tail. Lateral stripe on the second and third rows, of the same color, 

 broad, distinct from head to anus. A series of black spots on the first dorsal 

 row : abdomen uniform greenish white. Orbitals whitish ; occipital spots 

 obsolete. 



Descr. This species somewhat resembles E. Marciana in the pattern of 

 coloration, which, however, has the lateral stripe upon the third row only, 

 instead of the third and second. The difference in form is most striking, the 

 body being almost as slender as in E. s a u r i t a . The scales are rather larger 

 than in E. Marciana, and those of the first row more elongated. The ground 

 color above the lateral stripe is olive brown ; the first dorsal row is whitish 

 olive or greenish white. The abdomen is uniform greenish white, except a 

 small black marginal spot near the extremity of each abdominal scute. The 

 whitish dorsal row occupies one, and less than two half rows of scales, and is 

 encroached upon by the black dorsal blotches which sometimes reach the 

 central row. The lateral stripe is also encroached upon by the spots above 

 and below it, though never entirely interrupted by them near the head as in 

 E. Marciana. The head is dark olive above; labials margined vertically

with black, somewhat as in E. Marciana , except the seventh plate, which 

 in the former is heavily bordered with black on both edges ; in the latter, 

 slightly upon the anterior edge alone. There is a vertical light patch at the 

 angle of the mouth crossing the posterior upper labial, and confluent with the 

 white of the neck, and not distinct and crescent-shaped as in Marciana. 

 Behind the occipital plates is a very large double black blotch. Behind this 

 there are three or four perfect square blotches extending quite from the dorsal 

 to the lateral stripe, each three scales in length, and separated by intervals 

 of about two scales wide. Behind these the general pattern of spots is seen ; 

 it consists of two series of large oblong rhomboidal alternating spots, each 

 about four scales long, and somewhat confluent with each other at the adja- 

 cent corners, giving the appearance of a zigzag line upon each side. On the 

 first and second dorsal rows is a third series of very distinct black spots, eactt 

 on parts of three scales, and the extremities of two abdominal scutes. The 

 intervening spaces of greenish white ground color are equal in width to the 

 spots.

Other specimens have the dorsal stripe on a single row of scales, and the 

 lateral stripe has its upper border regular and distinct, without interruption 

 from the middle series of spots, the lower edges of which reach only the up- 

 per edge of the third row instead of the lower edge as in the specimen above 

 described. Instead of the distinct spots upon the first and second rows in 

 that specimen, they are here broken up into black borders of three approxi- 

 mated scales. In the only large specimen of this variety, the keels of the 

 first dorsal row are not parallel to those of the rows above, being directed 

 obliquely downward and backward, so that the posterior end of one ke^l falls 

 below the anterior end of the next succeeding, instead of forming a continu- 

 ous line. The nose of this specimen is also more pointed than in the typical 

 one. 



REGINA Baird & Girard. 

 R. valida Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Body stout for the genus ; head large, short but high ; broad 

 posteriorly. Snoui elongated, narrow and pointed. Rostral as high as broad, 

 subpentagonal, the apex pointed. Vertical very narrow, obtusely pointed 

 posteriorly : occipitals small. Nineteen rows of scales, all carinated ; the ex- 

 terior very feebly. Light brownish ash above, with faint black markings 

 upon the bases of the scales of the first, fourth and eighth rows of scales. 

 Abdomen entirely uniform yellowish. 



Descr. The body is stout for the genus, with the tail rather short. The 

 head is very large and proportionally stout. It is very broad and high pos- 

 teriorly, and tapers regularly to the snout, which is rather narrow, elongated, 

 and pointed. Crown flattened as in other species of the genus. Snout ele- 

 vated, rostral plate as high as wide, subpentagonal, and with the elongated 

 apex pointed. Loral nearly as high as long. Anterior frontals triangular, 

 elongated. Vertical very narrow, not widening anteriorly, the posterior point 

 very obtuse and scarcely triangular. Superciliaries proportionally wide, and 

 occipitals small. There is one rather large anteorbital, and two large postor- 

 bitals on one side, and three on the other, (which may possibly be the normal 

 number). Upper labials large, sixth and. seventh largest, eighth (the last) 

 smaller. Inferior labials ten, sixth longest. 



The dorsal rows are nineteen, all carinated, the outer row very slightly. 

 The scales of the first row are much the largest ; all the rest about equal. 



The color above is entirely uniform light brownish ash, (clay color beneath 

 the epidermis), with about every alternate scale on the fourth and fifth rows.

marked with black on each side near its base. Posteriorly the scales of the 

 first row are faintly marked with black at their bases. These black markings 

 are not prominent, and only perceptible upon close examination. The head, 

 including the upper labials and rostral, has more of an olivaceous cast. The 

 abdomen is entirely uniform pale greyish yellow, the tips of the scutella be- 

 ing, however, tinged with the ashy brown color of the back. 



1309, Durango, Mexico. Lieut. Couch. 



In its general aspect this species bears considerable resemblance to Nerodia 

 erythrog aster, from which, however, it is, upon critical examination, at 

 once distinguished by the number of dorsal rows and other generic characters. 

 It will, perhaps, be found that the faint black markings on the first, fourth and 

 eighth rows are the remaining indications of faded stripes. 



NERODIA Baird & Girard. 



N. Couchii Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Resembles N. erythrog aster, but the head is shorter 

 and very broad ; the muzzle broad and obtuse. Postorbitals three, much 

 larger than in N. erythrogaster, the lower extending forward beyond 

 the middle of the eye. Eight upper labials, all large, the seventh much 

 larger than in N. erythrogaster; the dorsal scales are broader and less 

 strongly keeled, and in twenty-three rows. Uniform dull light slaty brown 

 above, paler than erythrogaster. 



Descr. The head is short, but very broad and deep posteriorly ; the nose 

 is broad and obtuse. The outline presented by the head is subovoid, not 

 regularly tapering from the angle of the jaws to the snout as in N. erythro- 

 gaster. The prefontals are rather shorter than in that species. The post- 

 orbitals are very large, three in number, the lower one elongated forward to 

 beyond the middle of the orbit. The color above is entirely uniform dull 

 light slaty brown, lighter than in the lightest varieties of the erythrogas- 

 ter . The abdomen in both specimens examined is uniform brownish white. 

 Upon stretching the skin of one specimen, traces of the usual white transverse 

 lines are seen between the scales. The young are probably marked somewhat 

 as in N. erythrogaster.

This species very closely resembles N. erythrogaster, but can be 

 distinguished upon comparison by the lighter color, broader and shorter head, 

 and by the larger postorbitals and anterior position of the lowest. From N. 

 Woodhousei it differs in its uniform color, its much broader and shorter 

 head, etc. 



N. compressicauda Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Body stout. Form triangular, much compressed toward the 

 tail, where it is considerably higher than broad. Head elongated, rather 

 narrow, but very deep. Plates of the crown large ; vertical short, very broad ; 

 loral small; three postorbitals, upper and lower small, but the central with 

 its lower posterior angle prolonged to the labials. Twenty-one dorsal rows of 

 scales, all carinate, in form rather wide ; those of the first rows proportionally 

 small. Ground color yellowish olive ; four black stripes on the neck ; behind 

 this zigzag transverse black bands, which do not taper on the sides. Poste- 

 riorly these bands break into three series of spots symmetrically arranged, 

 not alternating. 



Descr. Body rather stouter than that of N. S i p e d o n , and presenting a 

 subtriangular form. This is most evident posteriorly, where, and on the tail, 

 the height is much greater than the transverse diameter. The tail is very 

 large at the base as in N. rhombifer, and does not taper from the anus, 



I860.] 




336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



but narrows abruptly at one-tbird its lengtb from the base. Dorsal rowt; 

 twenty-one, all distinctly carinate. The scales are rather broad, and much 

 rounded posteriorly, those of the first dorsal row disproportionately small. The 

 head is elongate and rather narrow posteriorly, but very deep and hut little 

 depressed on the snout. All the plates of the crown are large ; the vertical 

 very hroad and short, the loral longer than high, the upper and lower postor- 

 bitals small, but the central elongated so as to reach the labial plates. 



In pattern of coloration and structure, this species departs somewhat from 

 the usual style of the genus. The ground color is light olive brown, crossed 

 on the anterior half of the body by waving or somewhat zigzag transverse black 

 bands, covering two or three scales longitudinally, and separated by intervals 

 of one or two scales. These bands do not taper regularly on the sides as in N. 

 s i p e d o n , but are constricted upon about the sixth row on each side, but 

 are as wide upon the third, as on the vertebral row. Posteriorly these bands 

 become narrower, and finally break up into a dorsal series of vertically elon- 

 gated spots, and a lateral series of small circular ones, which do not alternate 

 with the dorsal series as inN. sipedon, taxispilotus and others. 

 For two inches behind the head, the transverse bands are replaced by four 

 distinct longitudinal black lines, the lateral ones each covering the third, 

 fourth, and part of the second rows, the upper ones covering the seventh, eighth, 

 ninth and part of the tenth rows ; these black lines are separated by a little 

 over one scale of ground color. None of the black markings involve the first 

 dorsalrow, which is yellowish olive, excepting some irregular dark mottlings. 

 The head is yellowish olive, with the middle of the occipitals and verticals 

 black, and a black patch extending from the eye back above the labials. The 

 rostral is yellow, distinctly margined above with black. All the labials above 

 and below, and the inframaxiliary plates are yellow, prominently margined 

 with black. The abdomen is yellow, with two lines of black blotches. 



1348, Tampa Bay, Florida. Mr. D. Welch. 



HETERODON Pal. de Beauvois. 



H. Kennerlvi Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Head broad, very short anteriorly. Rostral plate very large. 

 Loral plate very small, sometimes absent. Only two supplemental plates be- 

 hind the azygas ; the latter is sometimes replaced by two symmetrical con- 

 tiguous plates, and without any supplemental. The prenasal and prefontal 

 in contact with the posterior process of the rostral. Dorsal row of scales 

 twenty-three, all carinated except the first and second, which are perfectly 

 smooth. Ground color light yellowish grey ; a dorsal series of rather indis- 

 tinct rounded or subquadrate brown blotches ; a second series of smaller cir- 

 cular spots, much darker and more distinct ; below this a third, and more 

 indistinct series. 



Descr. In its general form and appearance this resembles the H. nasicus, 

 with which it is sometimes found associated. The body, however, is rather 

 shorter and thicker than in H. nasicus, and the head is broader with the 

 part of the head anterior to the eye decidedly shorter. The nasals are not as 

 well developed longitudinally as in H. nasicus, but the result of this 

 shortness of the anterior part of the head is seen in the very small loral which 

 is frequently wanting entirely. There is never more than one loral while 

 frequently two are seen in H. n a s i c u s , in which the loral is in every case 

 strikingly larger than in Kennerlyii. The most striking difference be- 

 tween these species is in the number of small plates surrounding the azygos, 

 or postrostral. While in H. nasi cu s there are always at least ten of these, 

 one or two of which margin the inner edges of the prenasals and prefrontals, 

 there are never more than two, and frequently but one additional plate in H. 

 Kennerlyii, and the prenasal and prefrontal are always in contact with 

 the posterior process of the rostral. The azygos is short, nearly as broad as 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 337 



long, and usually there are just behind it two contiguous plates of about the 

 same size separating it from the postfrontal, but not from the prefrontal. 

 Frequently, however, the azygos is longitudinally divided and without any 

 additional plates, but in contact with the rostral anteriorly, and the vertical 

 posteriorly, and not separated from the postfrontals. The vertical, occipital?, 

 superciliaries and labials are much as in H. n a s i c u s , though generally 

 less developed longitudinally. The rostral is as large as in H. nasicus. 

 The two outer dorsal rows are both perfectly smooth ; inH. nasicus, the 

 second is distinctly though delicately carinate. 



The ground color is light yellowish gray, with a dorsal series of rather in- 

 distinct subquadrate or rounded blotches, two to two and a half scales long, 

 and separated by intervals of one or two scales, rather wider anteriorly. Be- 

 low this is a series of very distinct purplish black circular blotches, covering 

 four scales transversely and two longitudinally ; below this, one or more in- 

 distinct series of spots. This pattern of coloration is very similar to that of 

 H. nasicus, but the ground color is always lighter, and the dorsal spots 

 are lighter and less distinct. The upper lateral series is of a purplish black, 

 and much more distinct, forming a prominent character. 



Abdomen nearly entirely black, except a few yellow scuta. The head is 

 marked as in H. n a s i c u s , except that the nasals, prefrontals and rostral 

 are all yellowish, while in the latter species they are dark in front of the light 

 transverse line which crosses the crown behind the rostral ; and in H. 

 Kennerlyi the light line across the superciliaries and vertical is much 

 broader than in H. n a s i c u s. This species differs from H. s i m u s in many 

 of the same features as does H. nasicus. These, together with the small 

 or absent loral, and small number of supplemental plates, will readily distin- 

 guish it. 



Rio Grande. Dr. Kennerly. 



Sonora. 



ELAPS Schneider. 



Elaps EURYXANTHr/s Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Head very small, narrower than the neck ; entirely black as 

 far back as the angles of the mouth. Body banded alternately with black 

 and light brick red, separated by narrow rings of creamy white, all the brands 

 immaculate. First broad ring behind the occiput red instead of black as in 

 the other species. 



Descr. Body rather stout, but less so than in E. f u 1 v i u s . Dorsal scale 

 large. Plates of the head small except the rostral, which is very large and 

 extends upward between the prefrontals. Prefrontals elongated laterally, more 

 so than in E. t e n e r . Post frontals small, elongated laterally ; vertical very 

 small and narrow, subhexagonal, pointed anteriorly, elongated and tapering 

 posteriorly; it enters but slightly between the occipitals. Occipitals small, sub- 

 triangular, the anterior edge square, very slightly notched for the vertical. 

 Seven labials above ; posterior very small. 



The fore part of the head is black, but the black instead of passing forward 

 from the anterior part of the occipitals to near the eye, and thus leaving the 

 three posterior labials yellow as in E. f u 1 v i u s and E. t e n e r , involves 

 nearly the whole of the occipitals, and passes backward entirely behind the 

 angle of the mouth and involves the whole of the lower jaw to behind the 

 posterior labial, leaving a broad emargination in the black on the occiput in 

 the bottom of which emargination are seen the white posterior tips of the 

 occipitals. Behind this is a creamy white ring, (probably yellow in life) which 

 is situated more posteriorly than inE. fulvius, and in vol ves only the posterior 

 tips of the occipitals and none of the labials. Next behind this white ring, instead 

 of a black ring, as in the other species, is a broad light brick red one involv- 

 ing eleven scales. A creamy white ring three and a half scales wide sepa-

rates this first red ring from a black one eight scales in width. Behind this 

 are alternate immaculate black and red rings, seven or eight scales wide, 

 and separated by white rings three to three and a half scales in width. There 

 are eleven black and eleven red rings on the body separated by twice as many 

 white ones. The tail is ringed with black and white without any red. All 

 the rings run entirely around the body of the same color, and are wholly 

 without spots, above and below. The plates of the head and peculiar style of 

 coloration in this strongly marked species cannot be mistaken. The three 

 colors, each immaculate, glossy, and clear, form a striking contrast, and the 

 red is probably bright carmine in life, thus affording the most beautiful color- 

 ation possessed by any North American snake. 



Elaps distans Kennicott. 



Spec. char. Body slender, with very narrow black rings, four or five scales 

 in width, separated by intervals, three or four times as wide, of brownish or 

 reddish, entirely unspotted. No light rings separating the red and black ones. 

 Under lip and jaw wholly without black, and the tip of nose light. 



Descr. Body very slender ; tail long for the genus. Dorsal scales small. Plates 

 of the head generally larger than inE. euryxanthus; rostral broad and not 

 as high as in E. euryxanthus. Anterior frontals rather small, and slightly 

 elongated laterally ; postfrontals large, pentagonal, as broad as long. Supercili- 

 aries quadrangular, elongated, narrow. "Vertical, pentagonal, rather large, but 

 narrow, the pointed posterior extremity inserted between the occipitals, as in E. 

 ful vius . 



The ground color of the body in the alcoholic specimen is reddish brown, 

 probably brighter red in life, with twelve very narrow black rings from head 

 to anus. At the edges of the black rings the reddish color becomes indis- 

 tinctly lighter for half a scale, but there is no well defined light ring border- 

 ing the black as in the other species. On the tail are five broad black bands 

 separated by narrow light rings. The anterior part of the head back to the 

 middle of the occipitals and the upper jaw to the fourth labial is black, but 

 this color does not extend on the lower jaw at all, and the lower edge of the 

 rostral and upper labials is light. On the posterior part of the head is the 

 usual light ring, but situated farther back than in E. f a 1 v i u s , its anterior 

 border passing across the middle of the occipitals a little behind the vertical 

 and thence down and forward to the fourth labial, expanding below upon the 

 whole of the lower jaw. On the neck behind this light ring is a black one, 

 about five or six scales in width, which does not run entirely around the body, 

 being interrupted for a short distance on the abdomen. Behind this, the 

 black annulations are perfect, each four or five scales in width, and separated 

 by intervals of fifteen to twenty scales of the ground color. The black annula- 

 tions are broader on the vertebral region than laterally and beneath where 

 they cover three or four dorsal scales, and the same number of abdominal 

 scutellse. The black rings on the tail are about eight scales wide, and sepa- 

 rated by light intervals of only two or three scales. 



The narrow black rings, separated by very wide intervals, will at once 

 distinguish this species from any of the others here described. There are also 

 no blotches or dots of black on the red intervals, and, if the colors of the speci- 

 men described have not been much altered by soaking, the absence of distinct 

 light rings of a third color between the black and red ones will form a striking 

 character. The color of the light occipital ring and of the light rings on the 

 tail is probably yellow or white in life. The mutilated condition of the head 

 prevents an accurate description of its outline, but it is apparently small and 

 narrow as in E. t e n e r .

OPHIDIA. 



Chilomeniscus Cope. 



Size small. Form stout, body cylindrical, the head not distinct. Muzzle round- 

 ed, very prominent, and muck depressed. Rostral plate large, with an ex- 

 tensive superior surface, and presenting an obtuse angle between the pre- 

 frontals : the inferior surface greater than the superior, owing to the back- 

 ward position of the mandible. Head shields broad, normal, except in the 

 confluence of the prefrontals with the nasals. Nostril connected to the an- 

 terior suture of the postfrontal by a groove. Loreal none, the postfrontals 

 reaching the labials. One pre- two postoculars. Scales smooth. Tail short, 

 the urosteges and anal plate divided. Teeth equal, or the posterior a little 

 stouter. Palatines and pterygoids present. 



This truly Calamarian genus is analogous to Stenorhina in the union of the 

 nasal and prefontal shields, and perhaps the form of the muzzle and inferior 

 position of the mouth indicates affinity to Chionactis. 



C. STRAMINEUS Cope. 



Common suture of the prefrontals very small, (in one specimen obliterated 

 by the rostral, ) that of the postfrontals but half the length of their sutures 

 with the prefrontals. Vertical presenting an obtuse angle anteriorly ; the 

 superciliary sutures converging posteriorly ; posterior angle less than a right- 

 angle. Occipitals short, their common suture scarcely longer than the frontal 

 suture of the vertical. Superior labials seven, the second reaching the minute 

 preocular, or should that plate be absent, as will probably occur occasionally, 

 forming with the third and fourth the inferior border of the orbit. Inferior 

 labials eight, fifth the largest. Geneials two pair, posterior half the length of 

 the anterior. Temporals 3 3 ; a larger central plate opposite the occipital 

 suture. Scales in thirteen rows, hexagonal on the flanks, a little elongated on 

 the back. Gastrosteges 117 ; one divided anal ; urosteges 22. Total length 

 of the largest specimen, nine inches ; the tail, thirteen lines. 



Coloration. Inferiorly, and upon the first and second rows of dorsal scales, 

 pale straw color. Superiorly, brownish straw color, each scale with a deep 

 brown dot near its posterior extremity. Top of the head grayish, minutely 

 punctulated with darker.

 Herr Peters identifies this genus with the Rhabdosoma of Dumeril, employing, 

 however, the name Geophis, which was given by Fitzinger in the Systema 

 Reptilium, p. 25, many years subsequently to that of Wagler. The typical 

 species isC. chalybeum, which the combined diagnoses of Wagler and 

 Peters do not enable me to recognize as having yet been received at our

 ness of this identification. The species of the genus will then stand : 



Ninia diademata. Streptophorus bifasciatus, Erp. Gen. vii. 520. 



Ninia atkata.* Streptophorus Drozii, 1. c. p. 518. 



Ninia Lansbekgii. Streptophorus Lansbergii, 1. c. p. 518. 



Ninia Sebae. Streptophorus Sebae, 1. c. p. 515. 



In these Proceedings, 1860, p. 77, I questioned the propriety of associating 

 this genus with the genera of Calamarinse. I now believe that it cannot be 

 arranged in that sub-family. 



Tkopidoclonion Cope. 

 T. Kietlandii Cope. 



Regina Kirtlandii Kennicott, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 1856, p. 95. 



This beautiful species, first described by Mr. Kennicott under Baird and 

 Girard's genus Regina, appears to be congeneric with the Tropidoclonion 

 lineatum Cope of Kansas. In neither species is the nasal plate entirely 

 divided, but a groove connects the nostril with the labial suture. The anal 

 plate in the Ki r t landii is divided, entire in the lineatum. I am not 

 prepared to regard this difference as generic here, though it certainly is among 

 some serpents. In dentition this genus is isodont, and the head is not distinct 

 from the body. 



The Academy's Museum possesses a specimen of the T. Kirtlandii from 

 Columbus, Ohio, presented by Prof. Lesquereux, and a second, half grown, 

 from the neighborhood of Trenton, New Jersey, discovered by my friend Mr. 

 C. C. Abbott of that place. 



This specimen differs in no respect from that from Ohio. This species has 

 therefore an extensive distribution, ranging from New Jersey to Illinois. 

 Its habits according to Mr. Kennicott, are terrestrial, which statement is con- 

 firmed by the observations of Mr. Abbott. 



Tropidonotus Kuhl. 

 T. ustds Cope. 



Scales in twenty-one longitudinal rows, all carinate, those of the first, faint- 

 ly. Those of the second row not larger than those of the vertebral. Head 

 narrow, not depressed, the end of the muzzle slightly elevated. Lateral bor- 

 ders of the vertical plate slightly concave, not convergent posteriorly. Pre- 

 frontals small. Nostril in the supero-posterior angle of the prenasal plate. 

 Loreal longer than high. Preocular single, two postoculars. Superior labials 

 eight, fourth and fifth bounding the orbit. Lower postocular in contact with 

 the occipital and a large temporal plate, which extends to the eighth labial. 



A second large, and three small temporals border the occipitals exteriorly. 

 Ten inferior labials, sixth largest. Posterior pair of geneials longer than the 

 anterior. Tail one-fourth the total length. Gastrosteges 126 ; anal one, di- 

 vided ; urosteges 66. Total length 12 in., 1 line. Tail 2 in. 10 1. 



Coloration. Above, a yellowish ferruginous, pale upon the head, very deep 

 upon the tail. Upon careful examination there are to be seen very indistinct 

 erect half bands upon each side, extending from the first to the central rows 

 of scales, alternating with each other. Posteriorly they become entirely 

 transverse. Belly salmon color, passing into orange ferruginous upon the 

 urosteges. Each gastrostege has a large central area of yellow, bordered on 

 each side with wax yellow, {cereus Lat.) these colors, however, blending pos- 

 teriorly.

One specimen in alcohol, sent to the Smithsonian Institution, from Charlotte 

 Harbor, Florida, by E. M. Baker. 



T. celaeno Cope. 



Scales in nineteen or twenty-one rows, all carinate except the first. Head 

 broad and distinct posteriorly, constricted at the orbits, and remarkably nar- 

 row anteriorly. Profile of the crown slightly, but regularly convex. Super- 

 ciliary plates narrow and elongate. Vertical elongate, its lateral borders 

 concave, not convergent posteriorly, its length greater than that of the occipi- 

 tal suture. Frontals small, the anterior almost triangular. Nasals and loral 

 rather large, the posterior border of the latter very oblique. Preocular one, 

 postoculars three. Superior labials eight, eye resting on the fourth and fifth, 

 sixth and seventh largest and bounded above by the first temporal. Remain- 

 ing temporals four on each side. Inferior labials ten, sixth longest. Posterior 

 geneials longer than the anterior. General form rather slender, tail one-fifth 

 the total length. Gastrosteges 145 ; one divided anal ; urosteges 71. 



Coloration. The general hue is leaden black above and below, with the 

 following paler markings. A band of leaden gray commences upon the neck, 

 occupying the second, third, and part of the first rows of scales. This ex- 

 tends to the anus, becoming darker, and leaving the first row of scales poste- 

 riorly. Upon the anterior third of the body irregular narrow vertical bands 

 extend from this, separated by black spaces of one and a half or two scales 

 in width, which spaces are sometimes enclosed by the confluence of the bands 

 on each side of the black vertebral line. 



One specimen (No. 351,) discovered by Mr. John Xantus, at Cape St. Lucas, 

 Lower California, and deposited in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institute. 



This species may be distinguished from those called Eutaenia, by Baird and 

 Girard, by its divided postabdominal scutellum. It, however, bears quite a 

 close resemblance to some of them, e. g., E. P i c k e r i n g i i . It is^unneces- 

 sary to institute any comparisons with our true Tropidonoti, (which possesses 

 the divided scutellum,) it is so strikingly different from all of them. 



T. TEPHROPLEURA Cope. 



Scales in nineteen or twenty-one longitudinal rows, keels obsolete on the 

 external series only ; second row larger than those of the back. Head distinct, 

 narrow anteriorly, its lateral outlines regularly converging from the canthus 

 of the mouth. Outline of the crown slightly depressed behind the plane of 

 the orbits. Head shields much elongated, especially the superciliaries and 

 vertical, the latter twice as long as wide. The lateral borders do not converge, 

 and the posterior angle is but little greater than a right angle. Nasals large ; 

 loreal as high as long ; two pre-, three postoculars, the former partially 

 united in an old individual. Superior labials eight, sixth much the largest, 

 its superior border and two-thirds of that of the seventh in contact with the 

 very large first temporal. Remaining temporals normally four, sometimes 

 confluent in pairs. Inferior labials ten, sixth the longest. General form 

 stout ; tail one-fourth of the total length. Gastrosteges 146 ; one divided 

 anal; urosteges 83. Total length 32 inches, tail 8 in., 31.; of a larger speci- 

 men, 9 in., 8 1., and the total length 38 in. 31. 



Coloration. Above plumbeous brown, shading into plumbeous grey or ash 

 upon the sides, which color fades into pale greyish yellow upon the middle of 

 the belly. Urosteges ashy, with a dark shade along the central suture. When 

 the skin of the upper part of the body is stretched, it is seen to be leaden black 

 along the medial line, with two or three series of quadrate spots of the same 

 color on each side. These spots usually alternate, but are sometimes conflu- 

 ent into oblique bands.

 Institution, Washington, discovered at Cape St. Lucas, in Lower California,

:>42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



The number of rows of scales will distinguish this species from Tropidono- 

 tus Woodhousei Hallow. Tropidonotus C o u c h i i Cope (Nerodia Couchii 

 Kennicott, Proc. Phila. Acad., Aug., 1860), has a very differently formed head, 

 but one preocular shield, and a few other distinguishing peculiarities. Tro- 

 pidonotus v a lid u s Cope (Regina valida Kenn. 1. c.) possesses a short head, 

 a rostral plate as high as broad, one preocular, and small occipitals, according 

 to Mr. Kennicott, none of which peculiarities exist in the T. tephropleura. 



The three Tropidonotes here described possess the true syncranterian type 

 of dentition. So also, does the Trop. rig i d u s Holbr., but the T. leberis 

 Holbr., and some other species included by Baird & Girard in their genus 

 " Regina," exhibit an almost constant isodont dentition. It is possible that 

 a genus intermediate between Tropidonotus and some forms of Homalopsina?, 

 may exist in nature ; that such genus be characterized by the possession of 

 teeth of equal lengths, and that the only name applicable to it be Regina : 

 yet the generic separation of the r i g i d u s from the leberis will not accord 

 with the present views of most herpetologists. 



Hekpetodryas Boie. 



H. Boddaertii Schleg.

Spilotes Wagler. 



The species of this genus may be divided into two sections, one character- 

 ized by the possession of keeled scales, the other having them smooth. To 

 the former belong the S. pullatus, poecilostoma and poecilono- 

 tus; to the latter, which Fitzinger has called Drymarchon, the S. cora'is 

 andm elanurus pertain. All the structural peculiarities of this latter group 

 are shared by the Colubri C o u p e r i and obsoletus of Holbrook's American 

 Herpetology. The latter species is not the obsoletus of Say, as supposed 

 by Dr. Holbrook, which has been correctly identified by Mr. Kennicott, and 

 shown to belong to a different genus ; vid. Scotophis obsoletus Kenn. 

 Proc. Acad. Aug., 1860. We therefore propose that Holbrook's species in 

 question be known henceforth as

Scales in from thirty-one to thirty -five rows, the exterior ten or twelve en- 

 tirely smooth, the central faintly carinate ; the scales three times as wide as 

 long near the middle of the body. Head distinct, elongate, depressed, espe- 

 cially upon the region of the sutura coronalis. Occipital shield as long as the 

 vertical, but subject, as in other species of the genus, to subdivision. Length 

 of the vertical one and a half times the anterior breadth, the superciliary 

 borders concave and slightly divergent posteriorly. Posterior angle obtuse, 

 Postfrontals four, elongate, all bordering the vertical. Rostral not prominent ; 

 as broad as high, possessing six sutural borders, the nasal twice as long as any 

 of the others. Nasal shields large, loreal longer than high. Preoculars nor- 

 mally two, sometimes three, or one. Postoculars three, exceptionally four.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



Superior labials normally nine, (exceptionally ten,) the fifth, entering the 

 orbit. Inferior labials normally twelve ; geneials two pair, anterior twice the 

 length of the posterior. Tail one-seventh of the total length. Gastrosteges 

 247, an entire anal, urosteges 61. Total length 5 ft. 4 in. Tail 9 in. 



Coloration. The ground color above and below is a rich straw yellow. The 

 muzzle is shaded anteriorly with ashy or fuscous ; this color gradually fades 

 into a lively sanguineous or testaceous, which tint prevails upon the posterior 

 part of the head, and anterior part of the body. There arises upon the tenth 

 or eleventh row of the scales of the neck upon each side, a longitudinal band 

 of the same color, which deepens posteriorly, and unites with its fellow at 

 intervals of three or four scales by a gradual widening upon its dorsal border. 

 Thus a scalariform series of dorsal blotches is formed, whose transverse di- 

 ameter increases regularly posteriorly, and whose intervals diminish, being 

 anteriorly four scales, upon the tail, one and a half. The connecting band 

 remains unbroken upon the anterior fourth of the body only. Separated from 

 this by an interval of one half or a whole scale, another longitudinal and very 

 narrow band arises on the neck. It is much more distinct opposite the inter- 

 vals between the dorsal blotches, and upon the disappearance of the line 

 connecting the latter, partially assumes its position, and breaks up into an 

 alternating series of very elongated spots. The dorsal intervals are thus 

 widened to a breadth of seven and two halves scales. There also commences 

 upon the neck a second lateral series of spots, which occupy a length of five 

 scales on the fourth, fifth and sixth rows. Their length decreases to three scales 

 opposite the anus, where they unite with the superior lateral series. Every 

 second pair of gastrosteges is tipped with sanguineous. All the markings of 

 this serpent are sanguineous anteriorly, but deeper posteriorly, passing through 

 shades of maroon, until upon the terminal third of the total length they are 

 entirely black. A black or maroon band passes along the suture of the uros- 

 teges. Belly immaculate.

In describing this species, I will repeat some of the generic characters, pre- 

 mising that the form belongs probably to the Dipsadinse, to the typical forms 

 of which it is connected by Tripanurgus Fitz. 



Dentition resembling that of Macroprotodon cuoullatus Cope. Seven 

 teeth upon the superior maxillary bone, of which one posterior is elongate 

 and grooved ; three central, small and recurved, and three anterior, very long, 

 the first longest and least recurved. The central three are not separated from 

 those anterior and posterior to them by spaces wider than those existing be- 

 tween themselves. Palatine teeth six, the anterior three the longest, ail 

 longer than the pterygoids. The three anterior mandibular teeth longer and 

 more widely spaced than the posterior, having an outward direction as in 

 Hormonotus Hallow. 



Scales in twenty-one rows, rather broad posteriorly and upon the middle of 

 the body, not larger upon the vertebral line. The body anteriorly is slender, 

 contracting to a small neck. Tail less than one-sixth of the total length. 

 Head very distinct, the temples much swollen, so that the greatest breadth in 

 life is just posterior to the eyes, though the length of head posterior to the

Mi PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



angle of the vertical shield is one line greater than that anterior. Side of the 

 head constricted at the orbits, the muzzle rather narrow and truncate. Ros- 

 tral plate broader than high, with but four sutural borders, the superior very 

 long ; the apex apparent upon the surface of the head. Prefrontals much 

 broader than long ; one -third the size of that part of the postfrontals visible 

 from above. Upon a vertical view, the postfrontals appear longer than broad. 

 Occipitals, superciliaries and vertical developed ; the last presenting a right 

 angle posteriorly, and having the lateral borders slightly concave and converg- 

 ing ; the first not longer, and about as wide as long, in contact with a large 

 scale in their posterior, common emargination. Nasal plates distinctly di- 

 vided, very small, higher than long. Loreal plates two, the anterior higher 

 than long, intercalated superiorly between the pre- and postfrontal, posterior 

 as long as high. Preoculars three, the superior largest, not in contact with 

 the vertical ; the inferior bounded anteriorly by the third upper labial. Post- 

 oculars three, the inferior a little the largest. Superior labials nine, fourth 

 and fifth entering the orbit, sixth largest, higher than broad. Inferior labials 

 twelve, the third and fourth narrow, and much produced posteriorly. Gene- 

 ials two pair, the anterior longest. Gastrosteges 236, one divided anal, uros- 

 teges 70. Total length 27 in. 10 lin. Tail 4 in. 4 lin. 



Coloration. The ground color is a light grey. The muzzle is crossed by an 

 indistinct ashy band, which extends upon the anterior part of the postfrontals. 

 The posterior half of these plates is involved in a deep brown band which 

 crosses the head between the eyes, whose posterior border is very concave, 

 extending upon the superciliaries to the vertical plane of the pupil of the eye. 

 This band is continued posteriorly, upon the inferior postocular and sixth 

 upper labial. A pair of broad diverging bands commences one band on either 

 side of the centre of the vertical, crosses the superciliary and occipital shields, 

 and following the expanded outline of the temporal and tympanic regions, 

 contracts and becomes longitudinal and parallel upon the neck. A brown 

 spot upon the posterior extremity of the vertical plates with a posterior 

 elongation, completes the resemblance of this figure to a lyre, or still more to 

 that musical (?) instrument familiarly known to children as the " Jews-harp." 

 The ground color appears upon the vertex as an anchor-shaped figure, and on the 

 cheek, as an oblique band. The back, as far as the anus, is ornamented with 

 twenty- one pairs of deep brown spots, their gemination only apparent anteri- 

 orly by the punctulate character of the scales in the intervals between the 

 pairs. These intervals are always about three scales wide ; the lesser, two 

 and a half anteriorly, one and a half posteriorly. Dorsal spots seven scales 

 wide; as the scales are broader posteriorly, the spots are also. There is 

 an irregular series of lateral spots, one opposite each of the intervals, some- 

 times confluent with the dorsal spots : anteriorly they form a very narrow 

 broken band. Another series of spots involves the tips of pairs of the gastro- 

 steges, which are separated by two, three, four, or even five immaculate ones. 

 Ten confluent pairs of spots on the upper surface of the tail. Whole under 

 surface whitish. 



Type (Sm. No. 4080), discovered by Mr. J. Xantus at Cape St. Lucas, Lower 

 California. Another specimen collected by Mr. Irwin, at Ft. Buchanan, Ari- 

 zona, appears to be identical, though in a bad state of preservation. 



The discovery of this species by Messrs. Irwin and Xantus, is one of the 

 most interesting additions to North American Herpetology. The form is 

 strictly tropical, for we learn from the Erpetologie Generale that the L. gem- 

 i n a t u s is Brazilian, and the scolopax has been brought from Guiana and 

 Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the eastern region of Bolivia. There are no other 

 species known. It is important to notice that the present species differs from 

 those of South America in the possession of two loreals and three preoculars, 

 but with our present knowledge of the Dipsadinae, generic difference can 

 hardly be predicated upon peculiarities of this kind.

Teledraspis Cope. 



In these Proceedings for December, 1859, I characterized a genus of crotal- 

 ine serpents under the above name. It was intended to include all the 

 serpents hitherto arranged with Bothrops, which possess undivided urosteges. 

 In examining the structure of these serpents, I recognized two sections ofthe 

 genus, the one containing a single species, and characterized by the possession 

 of a series of elevated scales exterior to the superciliary plate ; the other con- 

 taining several species, which have that plate, as is Bothrops, i. e. forming 

 the superior border of the orbit. It seemed probable that these might be 

 genetically distinct, yet the possession of the horned eyebrow by but a single 

 species, would not admit of such a conclusion. Since then, I have received 

 from Dr. Albert Giinther, his description and beautiful figure of Lachesis 

 nitidus, published in the P. Z. S., Nov., 1859. This serpent, which 

 was discovered by Mr. Fraser, in the Andes of Equador, is obviously a second 

 species of the typical group of my Teleuraspis ; we can perceive no propriety 

 in its position in Lachesis, a genus having urosteges anteriorly two-rowed, at 

 the tip four-rowed. 



In the Monatsberichte der Konigl. Preuss. Acad, for March 1859, p. 278. 

 Herr. Peters characterized a genus Bothriechis, for a species resembling a 

 Bothrops, except in its entire urosteges, and keelless scales of the vertex. 

 Excluding the latter character, which does not appear to be of generic value, 

 this genus is exactly co-extensive with my second section of Teleuraspis. 

 The following, therefore, will be what appears to me to be the correct nomen- 

 clature of the species included by me in Teleiiraspis 1. c. with the addition of 

 those here mentioned.

Kind wings much broader than the fore wings, ovate ; branches of the subcostal 

 connivent at their origins; discal vein curved; medio-discal on an erect mo- 

 derate stalk; the two superior nervules of the median vein scarcely from a 

 common point. Head roughened; with ocelli. Face rounded, rather narrow. 

 Eyes prominent, rather large ; antennae approximated, inserted on the fore- 

 head ; setaceous, with whorls of minute cilia, pubescent beneath. Palpi ex- 

 ceeding the clypeus, ascending, rather hairy beneath and at the end of the

 white portion is a pale brownish spot. Cilia spotted with dark brown. Hind 

 wings whitish, fuscous at the apex and towards the hind margin. 



Tnis insect bears a superficial resemblance toE. fasciatana.

A. ? coruscan a. Fore wings luteous, varied with dark brown, spotted 

 towards the base with metallic leaden hued spots ; a more or less distinct cen- 

 tral fascia spotted with leaden spots, especially on its edges, and a band from 

 the costa, near the tip of the inner margin, is edged with metallic leaden-hued 

 lines on both sides. The central and subapical bands are often dark brown 

 irrorated with luteous, and the basal patch sometimes distinct, and again 

 scarcely, if at all, indicated. Hind wings dark brown. 



In general appearance, this insect strongly resembles those of the genus 

 Exartema, but wants the peculiar appendage at the base of the inner margin 

 of the hind wings in the latter genus, besides differing from it in other respects. 

 In structure it agrees very nearly with the genus in which it is placed. 



Lozot.-enia Stephens. 



Fore wings nearly as broad toward the base as at the inner angle ; with the 

 costa much arched at the base, emarginate from the middle to the tip, which 

 is slightly produced upwards, and emarginate beneath the tip on the hinder 

 margin. The inner angle obtusely rounded. In the $ the costa at the base 

 has a fold or flap of scales on the upper surface. The disk is elongated, 

 slightly curved, without distinct secondary cell. The second disco-central ner- 

 vule is approximated to the medio-superior, and the posterior, very remote from 

 the penultimate, is opposite at its origin to that of the first subcosto-marginal 

 nervule. In the posterior wings the discal vein is curved and the disco-central 

 is approximated to the median system. 



Head scarcely rough, with a slight frontal tuft between the antenna?. With 

 ocelli. Face smooth and rather narrow. Eyes prominent. Antenna? separated 

 at their bases, setaceous, pubescent beneath, or microscopically ciliated. Palpi

The larva binds together the leaves of the rose and other plants. 



L. fervidan a. Palpi, head and thorax brownish ochreous. Fore wings 

 ochreous, with the basal patch reddish brown ; a reddish brown central fascia, 

 interrupted on the disk, with a shining dark brownish spot above it on the middle 

 of the costa ; near the tip, on the costa, is a dark brownish spot, and between 

 the two costal spots, beneath the middle of the wing, is a diffuse patch of the 

 same hue. Hind wings fuscous, along the costa yellowish white. 



Peronea Curtis. 



Fore wings with tufts of elevated scales scattered over the surface; costa not 

 folded, rather abruptly arched at the base, slightly concave in the middle ; 

 apex slightly produced, and the hind margin beneath it slightly concave; inner 

 angle rounded. The disk is placed in the middle of the wing, is rather narrow 

 and without secondary cell; apical vein simple. In the hind wings the costal 

 and subcostal are distinct, the branches of the latter connivent; discal vein 

 curved ; medio-discal on a short stalk at the bifurcation of the two superior 

 branches of the median vein. 



Head scarcely rough. Ocelli small. Face short, rounded, slightly tufted in 

 the middle. Eyes prominent. Antennae setaceous, pubescent beneath. Palpi 

 exceeding the face by one half their length, rather truncate, ascending toward 

 the base and porrected from the middle ; terminal joint minute, almost con- 

 cealed in the scales of the middle joint, which is thin and cylindrical at is 

 base, arching upward on its upper edge, nearly straight beneath, and densely 

 clothed with scales at its end, especially above. Tongue about one-half as 

 long as the anterior coxae. 



P. V i b u r n a n a. Palpi brownish gray. Head dark brownish. Thorax 

 blackish brown in front, dark ochreous behind. Fore wings grayish, with a 

 reddish brown costal patch at the base, and a large triangular patch of the 

 same hue, extending from the middle of the costa to the tip, and nearly across 

 the wing; it is margined internally with dark ochreous, and has an oblique 

 line of the same hue from the costa, passing through its middle. The tufts are 

 minute, black and disposed on ochreous colored bases. Hind wings fuscous. 



The larva rolls and feeds on the leaves of Viburnum and wild cherry. It is 

 immaculate pale green; head pale brownish. The rolled leaves contain a 

 silken web or gallery, in which the larva lives. 



Platynota. 

 Fore wings with tufts and lines of elevated scales disposed over the surface ; 

 costa broadly folded at the base in the ^, where it is abruptly arched, and 

 straight along the middle; the tip and hind margin rounded. The disk is 

 placed in the middle of the wing, and is broadest in the middle, without se- 

 condary cell. There are three subcosto-marginal nervules ; the apical branch 

 is bifid, with two disco-central nervules, the lower one approximated to the 

 median system ; the medio-posterior is moderately remote from the penultimate 

 branch, and is opposite the second marginal nervule. In the hind wings the 

 costal and subcostal veins arise from a common stalk; the branches of the 

 subcostal separate from each other at the origin of the discal vein, which is 

 somewhat angulated ; the two superior branches of the median arise at a 

 common point, where is likewise received the medio-discal on a short oblique

 the wings are deflexed in the apical portion along the middle. 



Head smooth, vertex elongated. Face smooth nearly naked, concealed by 

 the labial palpi ; forehead with a thin tuft. Eyes rather small, moderately 

 prominent. Antennae setaceous, pubescent beneath. Palpi exceeding the face 

 by more than one-half the length, crambiform, porrected, flattened, and taper-

 ovate ; middle joint suddenly arching upward at the face, whence it is porrected 

 and slightly deflexed, roughly clothed with scales above and beneath. Tongue 

 rudimentary, almost obsolete. 



P. s e n t a n a Head and palpi dark brownish, slightly sprinkled with 

 grayish. Fore wings dark grayish brown, with an oblique line of dark brownish 

 scales near the base, terminating in a tuft of the same hue on the fold. An 

 oblique line of elevated dark brownish scales crosses the wing from the costa 

 within the middle, to the middle of the inner margin, and in the middle of the 

 wing, exterior to it, is a short blackish streak, beneath which the wing is dis- 

 colored with dark reddish brown ; along the costa, exterior and parallel to the 

 central line, are two shorter and similar Hues. Near the hind margin, and 

 parallel with it, are two lines of elevated dark brownish scales crossing the 

 nervules. Hind wings yellowish fuscous. 



The larva feeds on the leaves of Viburnum pr u n i folium. It is dark brown, 

 with paler brown papilliform points, and two indistinct subdorsal lines of the 

 same hue. It leaves its food plant to weave a white silken cocoon, and appears 

 as an imago early in July. 



P. flavedana. Reddish saffron. Fore wing3 with an oblique line near 

 the base, terminating in a tuft on the fold ; an oblique central fascia edged on 

 each side with elevated scales, and a fascia near the tip, joining the central

 of scales, and with two transnervular lines of scales in the yellow portion. The 

 extreme hind margin is reddish ochreous, varied somewhat with dark brownish. 



These specimens may be only variations of P. s e n t a n a. 



Anchylopera Stephens. 



Fore wings rather narrow, with the tip usually produced acutely, and the hind 

 margin falcate or concave. The disk is slightly above the middle of the wing, 

 widening from base to apex, with four subcosto-marginal nervules ; apical 

 simple; two distinct diseo-central branches. The medio-posterior arises be- 

 tween the first and second marginal nervules. In the hind wings the discal 

 vein is curved. The median vein is either two-branched, with a medio-discal 

 nervule, or three-branched loith the two superior branches on a moderately long com- 

 mon stalk, and a medio-discal nervule on a short peduncle. 



Head rather rough. With ocelli. Face slightly tufted in the middle. Eyes 

 moderate. Antennas setaceous, pubescent beneath. Palpi exceeding the face 

 a little, slightly ascending but porrected, thickly and truncately scaled towards 

 the end; terminal joint slender, minute, usually drooping, and almost concealed 

 in the terminal scales of the middle joint, which is somewhat curved and 

 roughly scaled beneath and at the end above. Tongue about one-half as long 

 as the anterior coxae, and a little longer than the labial palpi. 



Tip of fore wings produced. Median vein of hind wings 2-branched, with 



medio-discal branch.

reddish brown. Thorax white, disk reddish brown. Fore wings white with 

 a large reddish brown dorsal patch extending from the base to the middle of 

 the wing, and rounded on the costal edge ; an oblique fascia of the same hue 

 from the middle of the costa to about the centre of the wing, with the costa 

 exterior to it streaked alternately with white and reddish brown to the apex. 

 The extreme apex reddish brown. Hind wings grayish fuscous. 



The larva feeds on the leaves of Spiraea o p u 1 i f o 1 i a (nine bark.) One of 

 the veins of the leaf is drawn closely to the midrib so as to produce a fold in 

 it from the base, in which the larva lives and feeds on the parenchyma of the 

 leaf. The larva deserts the food plant to form its cocoon, which is slight and 

 woven between applied or folded leaves. The first brood produce imagos 

 early in July. There is nothing characteristic in the ornamentation of the 

 larva ; its head and body are pale green, or yellowish green. 



A. nub ecu Ian a. Fore wings white with a dark brown dorsal patch 

 extending from the base to the middle of the wing, with its costal edge 

 irregular or doubly curved. The oblique central fascia is almost obsolete 

 except on the middle of the costa where it appears as a dark grayish brown 

 spot, and in the middle of the wing beneath it is a grayish brown round spot 

 exterior to which is a short black dash. The wing above the inner angle is 

 varied with grayish brown and brownish. The costa exterior of the middle is 

 alternately streaked with white and brownish, becoming reddish brown 

 toward the tip. Extreme apex reddish brown. 



A. Platanana. Fore wings pale reddish ochreous, whitish along the 

 costa at the base, frequently with a semioval patch of the general hue at the 

 base of the inner margin. An abbreviated central, oblique fascia of the general 

 hue, with two reddish brown streaks in the middle of the wing near the hind 

 margin, and the costa from the central fascia to the tip, streaked with the 

 general hue and whitish, and with two white streaks in the cilia beneath the 

 tip. Extreme apex reddish saffron. Hind wings whitish. 



The larva folds the leaf of sycamore near the base, weaving a web and 

 drawing the side of the leaf to the midrib in June and July. 



Tip of fore wings not acutely produced. Fore wings with very faintly 

 indicated secondary cell. Hind wings, median vein 2-branched, and with a 

 medio-discal branch.

 from the base, one along the costa, one in the middle of the wing, and one 

 along the inner margin. The costa from the middle of the tip is alternately 

 streaked with white and greyish brown. Ocelloid patch whitish with one or 

 two black streaks, and with scales somewhat silvery internally and externally 

 to the streaks. Hind wings fuscous.

 what triangular patch extending from the middle to the tip and rounded in the 

 middle of the wing ; in the middle and toward the tip it is dark reddish brown, 

 and along the costa tinted with dark purplish. The costa minutely striated 

 from the base. Hind wings fuscous, paler towards the base.

end ; the apical and post-apical nervules arise at a common point, from which 

 is given off a faint discal vein, which is obsolete in the middle (?) and gives 

 off on the costal side of the wing a disco-central branch ; another arises on the 

 median side from a short vertical stalk. Median vein 3-branched, the posterior 

 opposite the first marginal. In the hind wings the subvitreous spot is larger 

 than in the fore wings and angulated ; the tip is very obtusely rounded, and the 

 hind margin is emarginate opposite the disk, which is very broad. The costal 

 and subcostal veins cross each other about the middle of the disk and are 

 continued to the base of the wing separately ; the subcostal is bifid beyond the 

 origin of the discal vein which is faint and angulated, and the branches of the 

 subcostal separate from the point of bifurcation. The median vein is three- 

 branched, with a medio-discal nervule running parallel with the superior 

 nervule from an oblique stalk. 



Head smooth, although hairy ; rather impacted. Without ocelli. Face 

 broad, rounded. Eyes rather small, not prominent. Antenna? setaceous, 

 pubescent beneath. Palpi exceeding the face by about one-third of their 

 length, ascending and rather porrected, tapering from the base to the tip and 

 rather thick ; basal joint very hairy ; middle joint tapering to the tip, with an 

 external ridge and squamose, but not hairy ; terminal joint distinct, rather 

 slender, squamose, rather less than one half as long as the middle joint. 

 Tongue stout, and one half as long as the body beneath. 



Thorax thick and tufted ; patagid with long elevated scales. All the femora 

 and tibiae clothed with long hairs. 



D. oculatana. Head, palpi and prothorax ochreous-fuscous. Thoracic 

 tuft ochreous. Fore'wings fuscous, varied with ochreous-yellow, with a small 

 subvitreous spot on the disk. The base of the wing and a band just internal 

 to the discal spot ochreous-yellow, each varied with fuscous stria?; and crossing 

 the middle of the nervules is another band of the same hue, slightly clouded 

 with fuscous above the middle, having a spot of the same hue behind it, 

 above the inner angle. Hind wings with a large subvitreus spot, produced 

 towards the external margin ; similar in color to the fore wings, but almost 

 reticulated with fuscous. 



The larva is quite as peculiar as the perfect insect. It is sluggish, with a 

 thick and much contracted body, and uniform in diameter. Head as broad 

 as the body, black. Color yellowish or orange yellow, thickly covered with 

 rows of oval, black tubercles each having a hair. The terminal extremity is 

 furnished with a black shield. The second segment (the one next the head) 

 is naked, softish and rather swollen. Length about six lines. The larva has 

 a disagreeable odor. It feeds on Eupatorium a g er at oides (white snake- 

 root) beginning on one side of a leaf to form a cone or cornet, cutting and 

 rolling the separated portion, as it increases in size, sometimes across the 

 entire leaf. At maturity it eats away the closed end of the cone and falling to the 

 earth forms on its surface a silken cocoon. There are two broods of larva, 

 one which matures in June, July, and another in the Fall, to appear as 

 imagos in April. I have never seen the imago on wing, but it will be found, 

 doubtless, wherever its food plant is distributed. The plant is a common one. 

 especially northward. The insect is rather rare in this region.

Smicrotes. 

 Fore wings regularly arcuated from the base to the tip ; tip scarcely acute, 

 hind margin obliquely rounded; inner margin rounded. The disk is long and 

 narrow, and extends to the apical third of the wing; discal vein oblique. The 

 wing structure of fore wings as usual; medio-posterior remote from the penul- 

 timate branch; cilia of the inner angle somewhat produced. In the hind 

 wings the costa is emarginate or excavated a little exterior to the middle, and 

 along the hind margin ; not broader than the fore wings. The costal and sub-

costal veins are distinct to the base, the latter forked near the tip of the wing; 

 discal vein arising uear the middle of the wing, and curved; medio-discal on 

 a very short stalk ; the two superior branches of the median from a common 

 point. 



Head scarcely smooth. Ocelli small. Face narrow, rough. Antennae ap- 

 proximated setaceous, pubescent. Palpi exceeding the face scarcely one-fourth 

 their length, slightly curved, rather slender, and somewhat hairy ; middle joint 

 truncate, somewhat thickened at its end with scales; apical joint slender, 

 apparently very minute being almost concealed by the terminal scales of the 

 middle joint, but when denuded, at least one-half as long as the middle. 

 Tongue slightly longer than the palpi. 



S. peri tan a. Brownish ochreous. Fore wings paler on the costa at the 

 base than the inner margin ; with a brown central fascia inclined to the inner 

 angle from about the middle of the costa, edged internally with pale yellowish ; 

 this band is usually rather broad, but sometimes narrow. Near the tip, on the 

 costa, is a dark brownish spot, with a line extending from it to the inner angle. 

 Costa with a few minute brown points. Hind wings rather dark grayish. 



Exartema. 



Fore wings with the costa regularly arched ; tip obtuse and rounded ; hind 

 margin rounded, very slightly oblique ; disk with secondary cell. Hind wings 

 rather broader than the fore wings; obtusely angulated on the hind margin, op- 

 posite the median nervules ; inner margin deeply and sharply excised, with a 

 cylindrical appendage along the inner margin from the base, the lower 'portion of which 

 is free; the branches of the subcostal are connivent ; medio-discal arising on 

 a short stalk at the bifurcation of the two superior branches of the median ; 

 discal vein curved. 



Head rough. With ocelli. Tufted between the antenna?. Face smooth, 

 rounded. Antennae setaceous, pubescent beneath. Palpi arched, applied to the 

 face with the tips equal to the base of antennas; with rather hairy scales be- 

 neath from the base to the tip of middle joint, which is slightly scaly at the 

 tip above ; terminal joint minute, ovate, distinct and smooth. Tongue about 

 equal to the palpi. 



E. n i t i d a n a. Palpi yellowish white, terminal joint fuscous. Fore wings 

 dull sordid crimson, with a pure brown basal patch divided into two portions, 

 one a streak above the median vein, the other a patch beneath it, slightly 

 varied with reddish brown. The central fascia is pure brown, with an irregu- 

 lar internal edge, and externally subdivides into three broad streaks or projec- 

 tions ; that on the inner margin truncate at the inner angle, one in the middle 

 of the wing, and one near the costa acute. Slightly connected with the upper 

 streak, is a curved one of the same hue, varied with reddish brown, running to 

 the middle of the hind margin ; all these streaks are bordered with ochreous. 

 The costa is streaked with reddish brown. Hind wings dark fuscous. 



E. permundana. Palpi dull yellow, apical joint fuscous. Fore wings 

 with a large dark brown basal patch, varied with testaceous or yellowish. 

 The central fascia is dark brown, varied with testaceous, and is separated 

 from the basal fascia by a yellowish band, containing dull silvery scales, or a 

 tarnished silvery band ; exteriorly, the fascia throws off three more or less 

 distinct, short, rounded projections, two near the middle of the wing, and the 

 other at the inner margin, with a triangular patch exterior to the latter; from 

 the costa, near the tip, is an oblique, dark brown band, varied with testaceous 

 scales, to the hinder margin, beneath the middle. The interspaces between 

 these markings is filled up with yellowish, somewhat silvery-hued, or with 

 dull, tarnished silvery hue, and the markings are edged with yellow. Costa 

 with yellowish white streaks, with central dark brown streaks. Hind wings 

 dark fuscous.

The larva binds together the terminal leaves of Spiraea. It is pale green, 

 touched with yellowish at the junction of the segments; head and shield 

 black. The larva may be taken in the middle of June. 



E. versicoloran a. Fore wings yellowish, varied with short, dark brown 

 striae, and shades of the same hue, overlaid with testaceous scales. In the 

 middle of the wing is a dark brownish shade, indicated on the middle of the 

 costa by a nearly square spot. The oblique subterminal band is well indicated, 

 does not reach the costa, and the cilia opposite to it on the hind margin are 

 dark broicn. At the tip is a dark brown spot, and the cilia of the tip likewise 

 dark brown. Hind wings fuscous. 



E. inornatan a. Head and thorax ochreous brown or dark reddish brown. 

 Fore wings whitish testaceous or brownish testaceous, somewhat striated, but 

 without distinct bands. The costa is ferruginous, with rather faint, pale 

 colored streaks. The apical portion of the wing is either brownish ferruginous 

 or testaceous brownish, with one or two faintly indicated lines. Hind wings 

 reddish fuscous or yellowish white, and slightly fuscous along the hind 

 margin. 



The larva has the head and cervical plate colored black. The body, which 

 is white at first, becomes pale green, with rather pale, reddish brown bands 

 produced on the vascular line, and striped on the sides with the same hue ; 

 head, dark reddish brown. It inhabits, in May, a web woven between applied 

 leaves of white oak. The pupa is contained in a flocculent silky cocoon, and 

 is without dorsal spines. The pupa case remains in place after the escape of the 

 imago, which appears about the middle of June. 



E. fasciatana. Fore wings with a blackish brown basal patch and a 

 broad, nearly square, central fascia of the same hue, separated by a broad 

 silvery white band, having a few dark brown dots on the costa, and a single 

 line of the same hue from the inner margin to the middle of the wing. The 

 oblique band near the tip, runs from the costa to the inner margin, is dark 

 brown, overlaid with testaceous scales, and is bordered on each side by a stripe 

 of dull silvery scales. Costa with geminated white streaks from the middle to 

 the tip. Hind wings dark fuscous. 



Variety ? Rather paler brown than the above, with similar markings, but 

 the white band, near the base of the fore wings, is tinted with pale brownish, 

 and is striated with dark brownish. 



Hedya Hubner. 



Fore wings, costa regularly and slightly arched; tip rather acute, but not 

 produced; hind margin slightly concave, inner margin rounded; disk with 

 secondary cell. Hind wings broader than the fore wings ; apex obtusely pro- 

 duced ; hind margin concave beneath the tip. The branches of the subcostal 

 are connivent ; the upper branch of the median vein is forked, rather remotely, 

 from the insertion of the medio-discal nervule, and the discal vein is nearly 

 straight. 



Head rough. Ocelli small. Antennas setaceous, pubescent beneath. Palpi 

 equal to the face, slightly ascending; middle joint thickened with scales to- 

 wards its end, particularly beneath, truncate ; terminal joint slender, drooping, 

 minute, and is seen in the lower part of the scales of the middle joint. Tongue 

 rather longer than the palpi. 



H. Pyrifoliana. Fore wings with a dark brownish gray basal patch ; 

 broadly white in the middle of the wing, with the patch produced towards the 

 apex, and sometimes bluish pale gray and indistinct. Exterior to the middle 

 of the wing are dull, bluish, transverse streaks; and near the apical portion of 

 the hind margin and the inner angle, are short black streaks or spots. The 

 apical portion of the wing has, more or less, the hue of the base. Costa with

obscure streaks from the middle to the tip. Hind wings fuscous. In orna- 

 mentation, this insect is much like E. f a s c i a t a n a. 



The larva is of a dull amber-brown color, with papilliform points, somewhat 

 darker; head and shield blackish brown. Tt inhabits the pear and plum tree. 

 One of the leaves of a terminal shoot is cut off at the base of its leaf-stalk, lined 

 with silk, and folded ; other leaves are attached to this, and it is used even 

 after it has become dead and blackened, as a place of concealment. The 

 larva may be taken in April and May, and becomes an imago early in June. 



H. Scudderiana. Fore wings with a rather small dark brown basal 

 patch, with the edge obliquely inclined to the base, and rather wavy, broadly 

 white in the middle, and somewhat mottled with brownish ; dark brown and 

 white in the apical portion. Along the edge of inner margin is a row of dark 

 brown dots from the base. The costa geminated with yellowish from the 

 middle to the tip. Above the inner angle, is a white ocelloid-like patch, en- 

 circled irregularly with bluish. Hind wings fuscous. 



From S. H. Scudder, Mass. 



Bactra ? Stephens. 



Fore wings with the costa regularly arched, rather abruptly near the tip. 

 which is acute, but not produced ; hind margin truncate from the tip, inner 

 angle rounded, inner margin nearly straight. Wing structure as usual ; disk 

 rather narrow, without secondary cell. Hind wings broader than the fore 

 wings, hind margin regularly curved from the tip to the basal angle ; branches 

 of the subcostal connivent; discal vein curved; the medio-discal, and the two 

 superior branches of the median, from a common point. 



Head scarcely smooth. With ocelli. Antennae setaceous, pubescent. Palpi 

 very little exceeding the face, cylindrical, slightly, ascending ; middle joint 

 thickened with scales beyond the middle ; apical joint very minute. Tongue 

 wanting. 



B. ? argutana. Fore wings ochreous, tinted with reddish brown, and 

 striated with the same hue toward the base, and with dull purplish from the 

 middle to the tip. Above the inner angle is an indistinct ocelloid patch, con- 

 taining two black spots, with a dull, silvery streak exterior to them, and the 

 wing varied with purplish interiorly to it. The costa is streaked with pale 

 ochreous with dark centres, the third from the tip giving rise to a very oblique 

 purplish streak. Hind margin more or less yellowish behind the ocelloid patch 

 and at the tip. Hind wings fuscous or pale ochreous. 



I am well assured of the accuracy of my notes, and yet I find the record of the 

 larval state of this insect quite anomalous : at least, the imagos produced from 

 three larva, which one would declare distinct, are not to be distinguished from 

 each other. One rolls the leaves of witch hazel into conical cornets, and 

 binds the rolls with strong and numerous bands. It prepares for pupation by 

 turning down a portion of the leaf. Its body is concolorous reddish, except a 

 few spaces between the anterior rings, where it is pale brown; shield reddish; 

 head pale brown. Another feeds on the leaves of sumach, rolling a leaf 

 spirally in the first place, securing the rolls with bands, and afterwards joining 

 the neighboring leaves to the one first inhabited. Its body is of a dirty green- 

 ish color, with obscure whitish papilliform points. Head whitish, or with a 

 pale brown head and green body, striped with dark green. The third feeds on 

 the leaves of black thorn and elm, drawing them into a fold from the base, and 

 binding it to the midrib. It is concolorous lemon-yellow, with a yellowish 

 brown head. The differences in color may be reconciled by the supposition, 

 that the descriptions represent different periods in larval life; but if my notes 

 are correct, it is difficult to account for the difference in habits, as shown in 

 the third individual, which agrees in this respect with the larvae of the genus 

 Anchylopera.

Endopiza ? Guenee. 



Fore wings with the costa regularly arcuated ; tip obtuse and rounded ; hind 

 margin rounded, as well as the inner margin. Neuration normal ; disk with a 

 secondary cell. Hind wings rather broader than the fore wings ; costa slightly 

 concave from the middle; hind margin slightly concave; subcostal nervules 

 connivent at the base ; discal vein curved, with the medio-discal arising from 

 the bifurcation of the two superior branches of the median. 



Head and face rough. With ocelli. Antennae setaceous. Palpi slightly 

 exceeding the face, slightly ascending, truncate ; middle joint slender and 

 cylindrical towards the base, thickened with scales at the tip, so as to be 

 decidedly truncate ; terminal joint minute, ovate. Tongue about as long as the 

 labial palpi. 



E. ? Viteana. Antennae, basal half pale brownish; apical half dark 

 brown. Fore wings blackish brown, or purplish dark brown, from the base to 

 the middle, and reddish brown or dull ochreous thence to the tip. Near the 

 base is a somewhat curved slender band, and from the middle of the costa a 

 central, oblique, dark brown, or dark reddish brown fascia, widening toward 

 the inner margin, from which it is obliquely cut off by the paler color of the 

 wing, leaving a small triangular spot on the margin near the inner angle. In 

 the middle of the apical portion is a large roundish reddish brown spot, and 

 the costa towards the tip is geminated with pale ochreous. Hind wings 

 fuscous. , 



The larva feeds on the fruit of the grape in September; a silken gallery is 

 attached to the external opening in the fruit. Its head is dark brownish ; 

 shield blackish ; body immaculate dark green. It may likewise be taken on the 

 fruit of the wild raspberry in July. The individual feeding on the grape under- 

 goes transformation by weaving a cocoon on the surface of the ground, and that 

 from the raspberry under an excised and turned down portion of a leaf. This, 

 however, may not be its normal habit. 



Another individual, whose imago is included in the description of Vite- 

 ana, and is not distinguishable from it, except by the reddish brown hue 

 of the apical portion of the fore wings, and the general purplish brown hue, 

 differs in habits from it. It lives in a silken gallery, woven in a closed or 

 applied leaf of sassafras; usually the leaf is folded along the face and united 

 with the midrib. It is extremely active and agile in its motions, and weaves 

 with great rapidity. It may be taken early in July. The pupa is contained in 

 the folded leaf, without any cocoon, the tail being attached to a slight web. 

 The imago appears in the latter part of July. 



E? agilana . Fore wings dark brown, sprinkled with pure brown from 

 the middle to the tip ; at the base is a dull metallic bluish spot, and about the 

 middle of the disk a broad, short stripe from the costa, and streak from the 

 costa at the end of the disk, of the same hue. At the inner angle is an indis- 

 tinct ocelloid patch with an exterior streak and two internal spots of a dull 

 metallic bluish hue. Costa geminated with yellowish from the first costal stripe. 

 Hind wings dark fuscous, white along the costa. 



Carpocapsa Treib. 



Distinctively characterized by the large ocelloid patch at the inner angle of 

 the fore wings, which are much wider across the inner angle than toward 

 the base ; tip usually acute, hind margin slightly concave, (Pomonella has 

 neither of these traits;) disk rather above the middle of the wing, rather nar- 

 row, with a secondary cell; apical vein simple. Hind wings slightly broader 

 than the fore wings, nearly ovate; neuration normal, subcostal branches con- 

 nivent, the two superior median nervules on a very short common stalk, medio- 

 discal on a short, erected stalk. 



Head rather rough. With ocelli. Antennae setaceous, pubescent. Palpi ex-

ceeding the face, ascending to its middle, rather slender, clothed thickly with 

 rather appressed scales ; apical joint rather stout, small, ovate and smooth. 

 Tongue as long as the palpi. 



C. Pomonella. Fore wings umber brown, with a slight coppery 

 hue, varied or marbled with pale grayish. The ocelloid patch is very large, of 

 a fine, deep brown color, with an external and internal streak of bright metal- 

 lic-hued coppery scales, the latter having internal patches of black scales. 

 Hind wings fuscous, with a coppery hue. 



I can perceive no difference between this and the descriptions of the Euro- 

 pean representative of this species. The larva of both is of a pale pinkish 

 color, and feeds on the fruit of the apple and the pear. The species has proba- 

 bly been introduced from Europe into the United States. 



Ioplocama. 



Fore wings with a rather large, distinct ocelloid patch ; nearly as broad 

 at the base as across the inner angle ; costa regularly arched from the base ; 

 tip obtuse ; hind margin obliquely rounded ; apical vein simple ; disk rather 

 above the middle of the wing, with secondary cell, median vein straight, sub- 

 costal curved towards the end. The hind wings are broader than the fore 

 wings, ovate ; external margin slightly dilated in the middle ; subcostal 

 branches connivent ; discal vein arched ; medio-discal on a short erect stalk 

 and the superior branch of the median vein furcate about the middle. 



Head rather smooth ; with ocelli. Faae broad. Eyes rather small, promi- 

 nent. Antennae setaceous, with very minute dilations. Palpi exceeding the 

 face by rather more than one half their length, slightly ascending and porrected, 

 very thickly haired beneath, with a distinct tuft to the basal joint; mid- 

 dle joint with the hairs towards its tip, longer than the rest, and directed for- 

 ward, almost smooth above; apical joint minute, and almost concealed in the 

 terminal hairs of the middle joint. Tongue scarcely as long as the palpi. 



I. formosana . Fore wings dark brownish, with a most beautiful bluish- 

 violet reflection, when viewed from the hinder margin to the base, irrorated 

 with ferruginous brown. The costa toward the tip, as well as at the base, 

 ferruginous-brown, the former streaked with dull silvery. Ocelloid patch, 

 rather large, with two black central streaks and an internal dull silvery streak ; 

 the external silvery streak is connected with the third costal streak, which is 

 extended obliquely to it. The costa from the middle to the tip, is geninated 

 with yellowish. Hind wings dark fuscous. 



From Mr. Kennicott, 111. 



This group of insects is probably the most difficult, in a systematic point of 

 view, and the least interesting family in the order of Lepidoptera. The impres- 

 sion I have derived from the study of it, induces me to believe that it is owing 

 chiefly to the artificial system by which it is at present interpreted, and which 

 I have endeavored to follow in this paper. Numerous families, or so-called 

 families, have been arbitrarily instituted on the most trivial and untenable 

 characters, some of which are only sexual peculiarities, while ornamentation 

 appears to be a far more important element than structure, in the diagnoses by 

 which they are characterized. Such an arrangement possesses a certain 

 amount of convenience, inasmuch as it frequently enables the student or 

 inquirer to limit the probable number of genera to which an insect he may 

 wish to classify may belong. This, however, is its total significance, and 

 even in this respect it is often deficient and deceptive. This is a system of 

 convenience and not of nature, which works on categories of structure and re, 

 cognizable conceptions or ideas. 



In my own view, from which, doubtless, many naturalists will dissent, orna- 

 mentation is purely an individual characteristic of species, and although in 

 general sufficiently constant, subject to a degree of variation in the same spe- 

 cies that is often very considerable. Why should that which is unstable in 



[Aug. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 361 



species receive the stamp of scientific approval in the recognition of superior 

 groups, instead of that which is constant and fixed, which is more or less indi- 

 cative of modes of life, which is the expression in the imago of those categories 

 of thought that we designate genera and families? I cannot perceive why it 

 should be preferred, when I recall the wonderful fertility in structural inven- 

 tion which characterizes every natural family, and the logical connections 

 t^jat exist between all those groups of species composing its various genera. 

 If the specific conception is the same in the preparatory states, and the struc- 

 ture of the various imagos that result is nearly identical, differing in some 

 trivial peculiarity, perhaps, to which we are unable to assign any significant 

 value, would it not be more scientific and convenient, more natural and phi- 

 losophic indeed, to regard such individuals as forming a distinct group in the 

 genus, to which they are evidently so intimately related, regardless of peculi- 

 arities of ornamentation? 



What would be thought of that system in anthropography which sep- 

 arated men of the same race upon a long or a short nose, a large or small 

 ear, thin or thick lips, or wide or narrow shoulders? I am not prepared to as- 

 sert, that a principle like this has been introduced into the system which re- 

 presents the present arrangement of this family, but when one recalls its com- 

 parative poverty in generic characters in the imago, or otherwise the extremely 

 close relationship indicated in the diagnoses of many of its genera, the proba- 

 bility of something similar to it having existence is at least suggested to the 

 mind. 



It would be well if entomologists would cultivate just and philosophic con- 

 ceptions respecting the nature of the various groups at present recognized in 

 our systems. No other department of Natural History offers, probably, equal 

 facilities for observation and determining with accuracy the limits of generic 

 and specific cycles. The mind, however, must be disabused of the fallacious 

 notion that the imago is the most important part of species ; that it is, indeed 

 the species, or that classification can be truly and properly made on this basis 

 alone. Perfect insects are easily arranged systematically upon a consideration 

 of their entire structure, its general agreements and special differences, but 

 there are considerations more important than these involved in the idea of 

 species. 



The " imago" is no more the species which it represents as an individual, 

 than the principal noun of a grammatical sentence is the idea which may be 

 conveyed to our mental perceptions. Each is necessary to the other, each in- 

 complete without the other, and when a hiatus exists in either case, we are 

 placed simply in a region of conjecture, respecting the significance connected 

 with the representative presented to us. We have an object, but no idea. The 

 noun and the imago may be well known to us, but until we have followed 

 them through all the collateral terms in which they exist as the materials of 

 thought, we cannot duly value the conceptions which may be connected with 

 them. 



The advocates of the Darwinian Theory of the origin of species would have 

 us believe that species is an abstraction ; that it represents nothing ideal; that 

 in nature nothing but individuals exist, and in these must we look for the cha- 

 racteristics of species. The entire superstructure of reasoning on which the 

 theory is built, is one that admits what is material in the specific group, pro- 

 bably because it is obvious to the senses of every one, but ignores the existence 

 of that which is immaterial, intellectual, spiritual in every true specific creation, 

 and which is to it as the soul to the material body of man ; that which dis- 

 tinguishes the vital machine from mechanical inventions or imitations, created 

 by the conceptions of the human mind. Nor does this belong to the imago 

 alone, but is written in vital characters in the various transitional forms which 

 belong to each species, in their organs, and their acts and manifestations of 

 life, and intelligence or instinct. It is this, the definite conception, that casts 



I860.] 25 




362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



each individual of a species in the same organic and instinctive mould, that 

 cannot change. Individuals of the same species may change in ornamentation, 

 but never in structure, unless as the consequence of amalgamation with another 

 species, or an occasional abnormal modification, which is individual, not spe- 

 cific, and disappears with the individual. The creative fiat involved in the 

 life of every species and in its conditions, remains unalterable, because change 

 in that which has an organic, vital and spiritual significance cannot take place 

 without destruction to the species. 



The supposition that " profitable variations of structure" may be initiated in 

 the cell action of the reproductive system, in order that organisms may more 

 successfully maintain an overestimated " struggle for existence," is simply a 

 monstrous physiological fallacy and assumption. If we suppose amalgamating 

 influences to be inoperative, where do we perceive the evidences of it? The 

 vegetable perpetuates itself by a germ, which already has its type distinctly 

 impressed on it before the character of its architecture is developed by the 

 effect of influences under which it is gradually worked out, cell upon cell, in 

 one season or through a long series of years. In the animal, the reproductive 

 action is most probably, nay, there are well ascertained facts which directly 

 teach us that it is a simple process of continuous growth in species. Thus species 

 have not a transient existence, but rather a terrestrial immortality. Individual life 

 is ephemeral, specific life co-eternal with the existence of the conception pro- 

 ducing the representative forms. Individual lives are like the leaves of a de- 

 ciduous tree, and having performed their functions are constantly shed, while 

 the source of them continues to spread itself through space and time, until its 

 appointed period has ended. 



Under this simple view of species, supported alike by reason and all carefully 

 collated physiological facts, how the study of the humblest branch of Zoology 

 is ennobled. It acknowledges the existence in nature of a Principle as a 

 creative power, similar to our own minds. It deals with living thoughts, and 

 seeks to represent, through many misconceptions and difficulties, the logical 

 sequences existing amongst them, and to seize the hidden meanings which ap- 

 peal to our intelligence, in the ponderous volume on which they are inscribed.

Mr. Lea read an extract from a letter from Bishop Elliott, of Georgia, dated 

 University Place, Tennessee, Aug. 28th, 1860, informing him that he had found 

 numerous living specimens of Helix Cumberlandiana, which he had trans- 

 mitted to him. Mr. Lea stated that they had been received by him, and were 

 very interesting, from their having been found near to and at the original 

 locality from which the specimen first described had been taken by Dr. Troost. 



Mr. Lesley stated briefly the results of some observations he made in the 

 White Mountains of New Hampshire during the summer. His visits to this 

 region in 1849, and subsequent years, had laid the foundation for a growing 

 conviction that the range of the White Mountains would prove to be synclinal 

 instead of anticlinal, and therefore of probably Devonian age. A section which 

 he made in 1857, along the Grand Trunk R. R., showed him the synclinal 

 structure, with comparatively low dips, and at least two main anticlinal 

 divisions. The profile in the Franconia notch is evidently a cliff outcrop of a 

 horizontal plate. The newly opened Greely Mountain House in Waterville in 

 a cul-de-sac valley at the head of Mad River, and six or eight miles in an east 

 line through the woods from the Flume House, is surrounded by bold outcrops 

 of nearly horizontal massive plates of granite. Ascending Mad River from 

 Campton, the traveller has the White-face range on his right, with apparent 

 gentle dips to the north-west. But on his left he has the Welsh mountain 

 range and Mount Osceola, with an unmistakeable and universal dip, never 

 over 15, and much of it under 10, to the south-east, which can be studied 

 for at least seven miles, north-east and south-east. Turning to the left and 

 ascending Mount Osceola (which Mr. Lesley found by barometer to be over 

 2600 above the Greely House, and therefore not much lower than Mount 

 Lafayette), the bridle path mounts over successive outcrop edges of perfectly 

 horizontal plates of granite, as evidently and regularly bedded as any of the 

 sandstone masses of the Alleghanies, the bed planes not being at all disguised 

 I860.]

by the cleavage planes. Between these plates of granite lie plates of un- 

 changed dark blue sandstone ; a rock which at the cascades (two miles from 

 the house in another direction) has been mistaken for greenstone trap. The 

 successive terraces and cliffs of the mountain are evidently the consequences of 

 this horizontal and alternate structure. As in other horizontal mountain 

 plateaus the terraces here are projected between the ravines in the form of 

 noses, with straight crests, and terraced or stepped at their ends. In fact, to 

 a practised topographical eye, the aspect of the whole White Mountain range 

 is that of synclinal erosion. 



Other considerations reinforce this opinion. The continuation and broaden- 

 ing of the range north-eastward through Maine and Lower Canada, where super- 

 3ilurian rocks abound, the termination of the range south-eastward before 

 reaching Massachusetts and Vermont, as the Alleghany synclinal stops at Catts- 

 kill before crossing the Hudson, the presence of horizontal rocks at Worcester 

 and more generally than would be supposed through middle New England 

 the fact that the Connecticut Valley runs everywhere under the western es- 

 carprrrent of the White Mountains, separating it from the silurian range of the 

 Green Mountains, and the presence of Potsdam and other low formations in 

 eastern Massachusetts, all these facts would find their explanation in a 

 synclinal terminal eroded structure of the White Mountain mass. 



Tl>e granite of Mount Osceola and the surrounding heights consists of large 

 crystals of feldspar, smaller crystals of quartz and smaller flakes of mica. 

 Here and there hornblende appears. The rock bears no resemblance to the 

 subfeilurian Highland and Blue Ridge range, and Adirondacks. It is friable 

 under the weather, shedding its crystals upon the ground under every over- 

 hanging ledge. The boulders are rounded by the weather action apparently 

 more than by movement ; for they have only travelled down the slopes be- 

 neath the cliffs from which they have fallen, and where those that remain are 

 sharp-angled. The peculiar gravel and sand of the Mad River Valley is a local 

 drift of similar origin. The metamorphism of these granites is considered by 

 Logan, Hunt, and others, as no longer disputable. They could easily originate 

 in the clayey sandstones of Formations VIII., IX. and X., of the Appalachians. 



Considering the whole White Mountain mass a synclinal plateau,then the sum- 

 mit of Mount Washington, which is such an acknowledged anomaly, becomes 

 regularly the single residual fragment of the highest formation which escaped 

 erosion. Its rock is so different in texture and structure from the rest of the 

 mountains that no other explanation seems possible ; and if this hypothesis be 

 adopted, there is no longer any need of that which supposes the submergence 

 of New England up to the base of the head of Mt. Washington and no higher, 

 leaving the head in the air to escape the general rounding and polishing 

 action. It becomes easy to consider the external difference due rather to the 

 difference of the rock formations above and below that horizon. 



It is to be hoped that a systematic explanation will be made of this interest- 

 ing region and the structure made out and mapped, so that we may arrive at 

 conclusions, instead of venturing conjectures.

Description of a new species of Astroscopus, Brev., in the Museum of the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



BY CHARLES C. ABBOTT. 



Astroscopus guttatus Abbott. Plate VII. 



Spec. Char. Body depressed anteriorly. Head flattened ab >ve. Two sub- 

 quadrangular depressions posterior to the orbits. Eyes prominent, situated 

 in circular depressions, and five and a half diameters distant. The base of 

 the two dorsals equals in length the distance from the anterior insertion of 

 the first dorsal to the extremity of the upper jaw. Opercular apparatus large, 

 the branchial aperture unusually wide ; the opercle marked with distinct 

 radiating striae, and margined below with a smooth, thick and semi-transparent 

 membrane, which extends beyond the insertion of the pectoral fin. The in- 

 sertion of the ventral fins is opposite the margin of the preopercle and greatly 

 anterior to the insertion of the pectorals. The insertion of the anal fin is 

 slightly posterior to the anterior insertion of the second dorsal, and extends 

 nearer the base of the caudal than that fin.

Color. In the alcoholic specimen. Back, upper portion of the cheeks, up- 

 per part of cranium, and upper jaw, bright chocolate ; lighter on the head 

 than body, and the depressions on the upper surface of the head very pale. 

 Belly and throat pure white. The chocolate tinted surfaces are minutely 

 covered with numerous circular spots or guttse, of the same tint, but several 

 shades lighter. The membrane of the first dorsal black ; and the second dor- 

 sal has three irregular bands of dull black, obliquely across it. The caudal 

 with three parallel bands of blackish-brown, the middle of which a2Jpears to 

 be the continuation of a variable longitudinal band on the centre of each side. 

 The anal has a variable band of dull brown, darker upon the posterior termi- 

 nation.

Description of a new species of Chatoessus, Ctiv., from New Jersey. 

 BY CHARLES C. ABBOTT. 



Chatoessus insociabilis Abbott. 



Spec. Char. Body compressed, sub-elliptical ; dorsal outline greatly arched 

 anteriorly to the dorsal flu, slightly and obliquely curved posteriorly. Ven- 

 tral outline regularly curved from posterior insertion of the anal fin to the 

 throat. Abdomen compressed, carinate and serrated. The head is very 

 small ; the breadth anterior to the angle of the opercle six-sevenths of the 

 length from occiput to the extremity of the snout. Snout globose ; upper lip 

 fleshy, longer than the lower, which is membraneous. The angle of the jaws 

 in a line with the centre of the orbits. Margin of opercle membraneous, 

 coarsely serrated ; margin of preopercle, membraneous and circular. 



Dorsal fin quadrangular, the posterior ray prolonged ; pectoral fin rounded, 

 reaching beyond the base of the ventral fin ; ventral fin equal in width to its 

 length and reaching a slight distance beyond the posterior insertion of the 

 dorsal fin ; caudal fin forked. The number of the fin rays are,

getlier, except on the peduncle of the tail. The fins partake of the color of 

 the region to which they belong, and exhibit irregularly shaped spots on each. 

 These markings on the fins are very variable, and in some specimens are 

 wanting. A very deep glossy black circular spot, above the angle of the oper- 

 cle, marks the beginning of the lateral line, which is only apparent on a very 

 careful examination. Total length, 15 inches ; greatest width, 5^ inches. 



This species is possessed of a gizzard similar to that of C. ellipticus 

 Kirtland ; to which species this bears considerable resemblance, yet is very 

 distinct in its general form, color and habits. 



The specimens of this fish, from which the description was taken, I pro- 

 cured in a secluded and very deep sheet of water, known as the "Sturgeon 

 Pond," situated two miles below Trenton, N.J. The following items of its 

 habits were collected from reliable fishermen and by my own observation. 

 This fish is remarkably gregarious, and is never seen associating with any 

 other than its own species ; it is a lover of deep and still water, seldom rising 

 to the surface, and appears very averse to the bright light of the sun. If 

 driven into a stream of water with considerable current, they immediately 

 show signs of uneasiness, and, if not soon liberated, die. Two localities only 

 I am acquainted with that abound with this species, and both are deep small 

 lakes formed by the junction of several small streams, and never in these 

 streams has the fish been discovered, except when driven into them by the 

 fishermen. As an article of food they are entirely worthless ; yet they afford 

 much sport to juvenile anglers, by the rapidity with which they may betaken, 

 with a trout-fly, or common angling worm. 



Descriptions of new Cretaceous Corals from New Jersey. 

 BY WM. M. GABB AND GEO. H. HORN. 



Hippothoa irregularis . Colony spreading, on shells, forming straight, 

 cr but slightly curved lines ; branching nearly at right angles, though gene- 

 rally from but one side of the cell. Cells oval, flattened, placed closely 

 together, united by a stout pedicle. Opening nearly central, with its greatest 

 diameter in the direction of the length of the cell, often with an ovarian 

 vesicle at the distal extremity. 



The shape of the cell of this species relates it nearly to the H. simplex 

 D'Orb. 



Cellepora b i 1 a b i a t a . Colony encrusting, generally in elongate patches. 

 Cells in lines arranged in an irregular quincunx, convex. Opening, viewed 

 from above, nearly circular. The cell walls above and below the mouth pro- 

 ject, forming two labiate processes. 



Cellepora car in at a. Colony encrusting. Cells in quincunx. Walls of 

 cells meeting anteriorly, forming a carina, whose apex projects forward, and 

 toward the oral opening, apex often perforated.*" Carina diminishing as it 

 approaches the cell below. 



Cellepora t y p i c a . Colony encrusting, in large patches. Cells arranged 

 in radiating lines, usually in quincunx, irregular exteriorly, small, rhom- 

 boidal, spaces between oral openings wide, perforated by numerous large 

 accessory foramina. 



This specimen was found encrusting a Terebratula H a r 1 a n i, to which was 

 also attached an Ostrea panda, both being typical specimens. 



Reticulipora s a g e n a . Colony large (about one inch in diameter), formed 

 of plates, lateral plates not numerous, given off rectangularly ; summit of 

 plates perforated by cells, and thicker than the rest of the plate ; lateral open- 

 ings triangular, without any marked arrangement.

On Milne-Edwards' Synonymy of Xiphigorgia setacea. 

 BY GEO. H. HORN. 



My attention was directed to the above, by finding the polypidom, called by 

 Dana ' ' Gorgonia (Pterogorgia) setacea," classed with the "X. setacea" 

 of M. -Edwards, who considers them synonymous. 



The"X. setacea" of Edwards is thus described : 



"Polypiero'ide en forme de rubans tres-etroits, flexueux et tres-longs, mais 

 sans vestige de ramifications. Coenenchyme jaune ; verrues caliciferes 

 arrondies, de couleur rose, et formant, de chaque cote, une bordure saillante. 



Hab. Mers d' Anterique. ' ' 



Pallas' original description is 



"Gorgonia, simplex, rigida, cortice calcareo albo subverrucosa. 



Locus. Mare Americanum." 



Dana subsequently amplified the above description, rendering it more ex- 

 plicit. 



" Gorgonia (Pterogorgia) setacea. Whitish, simple, rigid, rarely with a 

 single branch ; surface subverruculose ; verruculse minute (one-third of a 

 line), and obsolete, numerous and crowded, mostly on two opposite sides, 

 with a narrow, naked interval between. 



Laguayra. Z. Collins." 



The latter description was derived from a specimen in the Academy's 

 Museum, and does not resemble either the description or figure of Milne- 

 Edwards. 



The " X. s et a c e a," as described and figured by Milne-Edwards, agrees in 

 every important respect with the " Gorgonia j uncea" of Pallas and subse- 

 quent authors. 



''G. simplicissima, attenuata, subflexuoso, cortice crasso, rubro verrucoso." 

 PaLlas, 1766. 



" G. simplicissima, teres, utrinque, attenuata, osse corneo fusco, carne 

 ochracea bisulcata, osculis crebris linearibus uotata. " Ellis, 1786. 



"G. simplicissima, longissima, teres ; carne ochracea subminiata ; osculis, 

 crebris sparsis subgranulatis." Lamarck, 1816. 



From the above descriptions, we conclude, that the species described 

 by Milne-Edwards as "setacea," is none other than the " j u nc ea" of 

 older authors. 



Pterogorgia simplex described by Valenciennes, in Comptes Rendus, 

 xli. (pp. 10, et 13), differs from either the " s e tacea" or "j uncea" in 

 the form of its " verrues caliciferes." 



The true disposition of these polypidoms appears to be as follows :

Descriptions of Reptiles from Tropical America and Asia. 

 BY E. D. COPE. 



SlDEROLAMPRUS Cope. 



Scales smooth, toes 5 5. Palatine teeth none. Lower eyelid covered with 

 large scales. Nostril in the centre of an elongate nasal plate. Two pairs of 

 supranasals, contiguous. Internasal present, fronto-nasals absent. Frontal 

 in contact with the interparietal, thus separating the fronto-parietals. Parietals 

 small, widely separated by the broad occipital. Tail cylindrical. 



This genus of scinks is most nearly allied to Eumeces and Otosaurus, but 

 may be distinguished by the presence of two pairs of supranasals, and absence 

 of fronto-nasal. 



S. KNNEAGRAMMUS Cope. 



Vertical plate elongate, broadest posteriorly, the lateral borders very con- 

 cave. Palpebral plates five. Tail longer than the head and body. Color 

 above glossy black, shading into ultramarine blue about the middle of the 

 tail. A delicate line of the latter color occupies the centre of each of the cen- 

 tral nine rows of dorsal scales. These are all discontinued upon the occiput, 

 except the external one upon each side, which passes round the side of the 

 head and meets its fellow upon the muzzle. The palpebral and supranasal 

 plates are suffused with blue, and delicately bordered with black. Beneath 

 dirty white, shaded with blue upon the abdomen and tail. Length of head and 

 body to vent, 15 lines ; of tail (mutilated) 16 lines. 



This beautiful little scink was discovered by Sr. Rafael M. De Oca, in the 

 vicinity of Jalapa, Mexico, and obtained for the Academy by Dr. Thomas 

 Wilson. 



Tropidonotus coMPSOLiEMDS Cope. 



Scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, all keeled. Head distinct, short, deep ; 

 profile anteriorly descending. Rostral plate twice as broad as high. Pre- 

 frontals subtriangular ; loreal longer than high. One rather narrow preocular ; 

 postoculars three, the lowest very small. Vertical and superciliaries elongate ; 

 lateral borders of the former scarcely converging; the latter narrow. Superior 

 labials eight, fourth and fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials nine. Tail 

 slender, slightly compressed at the base, three-tenths of the total length. Gas- 

 trosteges 126; a divided anal; urosteges 67. Total length 16 inches of tail 

 3 in. 6 lin. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 369 



Coloration. Above blackish brown, darkest anteriorly. Very indistinct, 

 pale transverse bands are apparent. They are irregularly oblique, and separa- 

 ted by intervals of two or three scales wide. Superior and inferior labials 

 more or less completely margined anteriorly with yellow ; geneial and gular 

 plates spotted irregularly with the same. General color beneath a peculiar 

 stone brown. A darker shade occupies the centres of the gastrosteges as far 

 as the vent. This is almost excluded anteriorly by a central series of trans- 

 versely elliptical yellow spots, one near the anterior border of each gastrostege. 

 These become narrower, and broken, and upon the posterior two-thirds of the 

 belly are almost lost. There is a very indistinct row of smaller spots upon 

 each side of it anteriorly. 



Habilat. ? Key West. Mus. Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, 

 This species should be compared with T. sipedon, T. celaeno and 

 T. valid us. It differs from the first in the number of rows of scales, and 

 from all three in the form of the muzzle and coloration of the lower surface. 



Thamnophis scalaris Cope. 



Head narrow, elevated, the profile sloping in front, muzzle obtuse. General 

 form moderately slender, the tail a little less than one fourth the total length. 

 Superciliary and vertical plates elongate, the lateral borders of the latter 

 straight and convergent. Occipitals elongate. Loreal plate higher than long^ 

 one pre-, three postoculars. Superior labials eight, fourth and fifth entering the 

 orbit. Inferior labials ten. Anterior geneials longer than posterior. Scales 

 in nineteen rows, not emarginate, the external smooth. Gastrosteges 143 ; an 

 entire anal; urosteges 59 pair. 



Coloration. Beneath, and upon the first row of scales, dark, ashy olivaceous, 

 the latter frequently black at their bases. Second and half the third row of 

 scales a little paler. The vertebral, and the borders of one row on each side 

 of it, yellowish. The color of the remainder of the upper surface is brown, 

 anteriorly shaded with olivaceous. This is crossed from the lateral to the 

 dorsal stripe on each side, by vertical bars, black, or deep brown bordered 

 with black, numbering from the head to the origin of the tail, about sixty. 

 There is a pair of large spots just behind the occipital plates, and one involving 

 the temporals and the whole of the occipitals, its anterior border trilobate and 

 produced upon the vertical and superciliaries. A short yellowish vitta extending 

 from the posterior angle of the former plate along the occipital suture, repre- 

 sents a confluent pair of occipital spots. 



Habitat. Jalapa, Mexico, found by Sr. R. M. De Oca. Mus. Academy. Pre- 

 sented by Thos. B. Wilson. M. D. 



Arizona Jani Cope. 



Head not very distinct, tapering. Rostral plate rounded, presenting an 

 obtuse angle between the prefrontals, Post-frontals bent upon the sides of 

 the head. Vertical longer than broad, the lateral borders much converging, 

 posterior angle obtuse. Occipitals longer than vertical, subdivided as in 

 Pityophis sp. Nostril between the nasals ; loreal plate longer than high. One 

 preocular not reaching the vertical, three postoculars. Superior labials eight, 

 fourth and fifth entering the orbit, inferior labials twelve, sixth largest. Post- 

 geneials shorter than pre-genials. Scales of the body in twenty-seven or nine 

 rows, the central thirteen keeled. Tail short. 



Coloration. Above, a pale yellowish brown, browner on the crown and 

 muzzle. A series of quadrate dorsal spots extends throughout the whole length, 

 involving from thirteen to seventeen medial rows. Anteriorly they are sepa- 

 rated by spaces eight scales wide, but these intervals diminish posteriorly. 

 There is a lateral series of spots which alternate with those of the dorsal row, 

 and are sometimes confluent with others, which form a series along the tips of 

 the gastrosteges posteriorly. Anteriorly the dorsal intervals are divided by a 

 transverse series of three small spots, which are probably sometimes confluent. 

 These markings are all black anteriorly ; posteriorly, they are shaded with

 tail terminating in a rather long corneous appendage. 



Habitat. Buena Vista, Mexico. Lieut. Couch. Mus. Smithsonian. 



This genus is intermediate in structure between Rhinechis " Coluber " Gthr. 

 and Pityophis. It has not the four postfrontals of the last, nor the divided anal 

 shield of the first two. In form, the rostral plate is intermediate between 

 those of "Coluber" and Pityophis. The present species is nearly allied 

 to the A. pleurosticta Cope, (Elaphis pleurostictus Dum. & Bibr.) of 

 Uraguay. Named in honor of Prof. Jan, of Milan, a distinguished herpetolo- 

 gist. 



Dsomicus temporalis Cope. 



Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows. Head distinct, eyes small, anterior; 

 muzzle short. Mouth very inferior. Rostral plate prominent, but barely visi- 

 ble from above : prefrontals small : vertical broad, presenting an obtuse 

 angle anteriorly, one less than a right angle posteriorly, the superciliary bor- 

 ders nearly parallel. Occipitals well developed, each bounded by three large, 

 and two small temporals. Postnasal vertical, crescentic ; loreal confluent with 

 the preocular, (probably not a constant character); postoculars two on one 

 side, one on the other. Superior labials seven, third and fourth entering the 

 orbit. Inferior labials eight, fifth largest, seventh twice the size of the sixth, 

 geneial pairs equal. Gastrosteges 167, a divided anal ; (tail mutilated). Length 

 of head and body seventeen inches. 



Coloration. Above, chocolate brown. A narrow yellow band with a broad 

 blackish superior border extends from the throat to the vent, along the suture 

 of the first and second rows of scales. The greater part of the first row, and 

 the ends of the gastrosteges are involved in a blackish plumbeous band which 

 extends from the throat to the vent : the central third of each scale of the fifth 

 row on each side is brownish-yellow, the upper and lower thirds blackish ; 

 thus is formed a narrow black-edged band, which extends from the 

 throat to the end of the tail A yellow band extends from the superior 

 border of the first upper labial, crosses the lower halves of the posterior 

 labials, and widening, extends upwards upon the temples and neck, forming 

 apparently the rudiments of a collar. Throat and belly saffron yellow. 



Habitat. Probably Cuba. 



Mus. Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass. 



Amasteididm Cope. 



Body cylindrical, elongate; tail moderate, slender. Head distinct, broad, 

 short, tapering rather abruptly. Superior maxillary teeth in a coctinuous 

 series, the last abruptly the longest, not grooved'. Pupil round. Top of 

 head flat, separated on the muzzle from the sides, by an angle. Superciliaries 

 prominent. One anterior, two postoculars. Loreal none. Nasals large, one or 

 two, the nostril situated in the centre of the anterior. Scales on the posterior 

 parts of the body, slightly keeled. Anal and subcaudal scutella divided. 



This genus differs from Coronella Law. in the short, depressed, angular 

 head, and the absence of the loreal plate. The form of the head somewhat re- 

 sembles Xenodon, but the form of the body, the plating and dentition, are dif- 

 ferent. 



A. VELIFERDM Cope. 



Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows, smooth on the anterior half of the 

 body : posteriorly a few dorsal rows with faint keels, becoming stronger toward 

 the tail, and extending on all the scales near the anal region. Here they are 

 tuberculous, as in Aspidura trachyprocta nobis. Tail nearly one-third 

 the total length. Occipital plates large, almost reaching the labials in front, 

 posteriorly accuminate ; vertical long, acute behind ; superciliaries large, promi-

 gastrosteges. Every fourth scale of the fifth row on each side, pale, the adja- 

 cent scales on the fourth and sixth rows, generally darker. Top of the head 

 much lighter, varied anteriorly; palest behind the eye and above the labials. 

 The latter are dark with a few light spots.

 of the Smithsonian Institute, which were brought from Jalapa, Mexico, by the 

 well known collector, Sr. De Oca. Though it is a species apparently well 

 knojvn in European collections, considerable confusion exists with regard to 

 the synonymy. This it is the object of the present article to set right as far as 

 the means at the author's dispo.-al may enable him to accomplish it. 



The first published notice of this species is probably that of Professor S. F. 

 Baird, in his valuable " Revision of the North American Tailed Batrachia," as 

 above cited. He supposed it to be the Oedipus platydactylus of Tschudi, 

 as it appears to me incorrectly, though the meagre diagnosis of that author 

 renders any identification sufficiently hazardous. The name at the head of this 

 article is that of Dr. J. E. Gray, whose description in the " Catalogue of Ba- 

 trachia Gradientia in the British Museum," no doubt, applies to this species. 

 It is the first name published with an appropriate specific diagnosis, and there- 

 fore is adopted here. Dr. Gray was, however, not aware that to the present 

 species belongs the synonymy and notice of the structure of the toes, quoted 

 from Baird, under the genus Oedipus of the " Catalogue." That this is the 

 case, I have upon the excellent authority of Prof. Baird himself, who states 

 that the appearance of " sucker-like discs upon the extremities of the toes, 

 similar to those of Hyla," resulted from the contraction of the integuments 

 about the proximal phalanges, in an old specimen, thus giving prominence to 

 the small tubercle upon the inferior surface of the extremity of each toe. The 

 Oedipus of Gray appetrsto be the Oedipus of Tschudi, but I have seen neither 

 specimens nor descriptions which correspond with that of his 0. variegatus.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 373 



The best description of the Spelerpes Bellii is the first part of that above 

 cited, from the Erpetologie Generale, and which should be regarded as indica- 

 ting the Bolitoglossa Mexicana of the author of that work, although the same 

 species is figured as a variety of another, described in the text in a supplement 

 to the description of the first. The animal described in the supplement, is 

 there regarded, it would appear, correctly, as the Oedipus platydactylus of 

 Tschudi, and is not only specifically, but probably generically distinct from 

 Spelerpes Bellii. 



In size this species is only exceeded by some of the Amblystomata of the Mis- 

 sissippi Valley : one of our specimens is at least eight inches long. The tail, 

 whose length is about equal to that of the head and body, is compressed toward 

 the tip, but cylindrical and greatly swollen at the base, as in Hemidactylium 

 scutatum, though in a greater degree. It is encircled by grooves similar to 

 those of the flanks. The toes are short, broad, depressed, very distinct, and 

 with scarcely a trace of connecting membrane at the base, certainly much less 

 in our specimens than is represented in the fig. in Erp. Generale. The extrem- 

 ity of each is provided beneath with a knob or callosity. The palatine teeth 

 extend from the very exterior point of the posterior border of the palatine 

 bones, and from two nearly transverse arched series, which meet near the cen- 

 tre of the suture with the sphenoid bone. This resembles the arrangement 

 in the Geotriton fuscus and the Heredia of Girard, rather than the ordinary 

 Spelerpes, where the series are shorter, more oblique, and not in contact. The 

 patches of sphenoid teeth are more distinct and elongated than in the species 

 of Plethodon, but less so than in Pseudotriton ruber. A considerable space 

 separates these from the posterior angle of the palatine series. 



The fresh specimens of this species that I have seen are of a lead color , other 

 specimens are much darker, but whether this is a result of long preservation 

 in spirits I am not able to state. Upon the back is a double row of obliquely 

 pyriform spots of an orange red in life, but which became yellowish white in 

 spirits. These become confluent upon the neck, and, according to authors, are 

 sometimes preceded by a pair of large spots of the same color upon the occi- 

 put. Belly immaculate.

There can be little doubt that a salamander exhibiting a structure of the 

 feet similar to that of the present species, furnished the characters of Tschudi's 

 genus Oedipus, and also that of Dr. Gray. What species this reptile pertained 

 to, cannot readily be ascertained, as no description of it appears to have been 

 published, unless it be identical with the 0. variegatus of the latter author. 

 In this case it is not probably the same as that figured in the Erpetologie Gen- 

 erale, and of which two .specimens are before me. 



It is evident that the Oedipus of Tschudi cannot be retained, as founded upon 

 an undescribed species, even were it sufficiently distinct. That it is not dis- 

 tinct from the Geotriton of Bonaparte, is very probable, although it is contrary 

 to analogy to find a genus of reptiles in so southern a latitude as that of Jala- 

 pa identical upon another hemisphere. With the Geotriton fuscus Bp. 

 before me, I find the following characters common to it and the species which 

 is the subject of this article. Supra and postorbital bony arches absent. 

 Palatine teeth in two transverse regularly arched series almost in contact 

 medially. Sphenoid teeth numerous, in two oval patches upon the sphenoid 

 bone, separated by an interval from the palatines. Tongue boletoid. Paro- 

 tids none. Tail cylindrical. Digits 4 5, slender, united by a broad membrane. 



The broad palmation of the fingers and toes distinguishes the genus from 



I860.] 




37-4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Spelerpes. In the latter genus and its allies, the toes are distinct at all seasons 

 of the year, differing in this respect from the Tritons. 



Upon comparing the dorsal vertebras of the Geotriton fuscus and car- 

 bo n a r i u s, little material difference is apparent. Those of the former are not 

 so stout, and have the external ridge of the anterior zygapophysis more com- 

 pressed and elevated. In both, there is a single longitudinal spinous process, 

 but little elevated, obsolete upon the posterior part of the vertebra. 



The largest specimen of Geotriton carbonarius measured three inches 

 from the end of the muzzle to the vent: from the latter point to the end of the 

 tail is three in. three lines. The ground color above and below is black : the 

 back is marked with abroad, irregularly defined brownish yellow band, which 

 extends upon the base of the tail, and bifurcates upon the neck and occiput, 

 leaving a deltoid space of the ground color. This dorsal band is more uniform 

 in a younger specimen. The soles of the feet are pale. There are ten teeth in 

 each of the palatine series, and about three hundred and thirty in the conflu- 

 ent sphenoidal patches. These patches are distinct anteriorly and posteriorly. 

 In Spelerpes Bell ii, they are entirely distinct, and more clavate in outline.

In a very fine series of specimens in Mr. Swift's collection, I find some 

 characters which, are slight, but may be constant, and possibly indicate 

 specific distinctness from the common bird of the United States. The wing 

 coverts have much more numerous spots of black, and the outer tail feather 

 has its inner web always partly, and frequently entirely rufous, the same 

 color as the other tail feathers, and its outer web white, with segments or 

 semi-circular spots of black, having for their bases the shaft of the feather, 

 and all the feathers of the tail are more or less edged and banded with black 

 on their upper surface. These characters are not usually seen in F. spar- 

 verius of the United States, but are present in every specimen in the present 

 series, and seem especially to characterize the adult plumage. The colors 

 also are rather brighter than in our northern species. 



Seven specimens are in this collection, of which four are in adult plumage. 

 In all of them, of whatever age, there is a large rufous space on the crown, 

 and the size is very nearly the same as that of specimens from Pennsylvania, 

 or perhaps slightly smaller. The plumage of the present specimens does not 

 correspond with that of either of the proposed distinct species of authors.

 Two specimens in Mr. Swift's collection are much as represented in Mr.

 Birds of St. Croix, in Sclater's Ibis, as cited above. A wide superciliary 

 band of white is, however, more conspicuous in both of the present specimens, 

 than as represented in the plate, and there are a few other not important dif- 

 ferences. The tarsus is bare for about its lower two-thirds, in this singular 

 species, and covered with very small circular or hexagonal scales. Bill and 

 claws light greenish-yellow, which is probably also the color of the feet in 

 the adult bird.

This curious and little known owl, is an exceedingly interesting contri- 

 bution by Mr. Swift to the collection of this Academy, to which specimens 

 from him were for the first time presented some years since. Previously, it 

 was unknown to the naturalists of this country, though they were constantly 

 reminded of it by Vieillot's plate in Ois. d'Am. Sept., cited above. The 

 specimens described originally by Daudin, were from the Island of Porto 

 Rico.

 Numerous specimens very similar to specimens from Florida, but rather 

 lighter colored. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the difficult group of 

 American flycatchers to have entire confidence in my provisional conclusions, 

 but, at present, I am inclined to think the bird now before me, in Mr Swift's 

 collection, is probably entitled to be regarded as distinct, specifically, from 

 the bird of the Southern United States usually bearing the same name.

 Vieill. Ois. d'Am. Sept. pi. 37- Brisson Orn. ii. pi. xxxvi. fig. 2. 



This species scarcely appears to have been identified by late naturalists, but 

 like many others founded on Brisson's descriptions and figures, it is un- 

 doubtedly an absolute and veritable existence. That great ornithologist and 

 most excellent describer, mainly, and in fact almost entirely, relies on speci- 

 mens actually before him, for descriptions, and is exceedingly careful to refer 

 to the collections in which they are to be found. His figures frequently are 

 not recognizable, but no descriptions extant are more complete and satis- 

 factory. 



One specimen only, in Mr. Swift's collection, is not in fully mature plumage, 

 but appears to be the bird described by Brisson, as above, to which Linnaeus 

 gave a name, and an abstract of Brisson's description. It more nearly cor- 

 responds with Vieillot's description than with his figure above cited, but 

 appears to be the species of that author. It is a white-crested species, strictly 

 of the same group, and much resembling Tyrannula albiceps, (D'Orbigny et 

 Lafresnaye), and about the same size. 



This is one of the most interesting birds in Mr. Swift's collection, and we 

 hope to receive other specimens, which he has kindly promised to endeavor 

 to procure. Like all birds in the present collection, it was obtained by Mr. 

 Swift, in the Island of St. Thomas. Brisson's specimens were from the Island 

 of Martinique.

 Mr. Swift's specimens appear to be rather large, but they are apparently 

 identical with the bird of Jamaica and Cuba, and a visitor to Florida. It is 

 easily recognized and distinguished from all other species by the narrow line 

 of black running downward, on each side of the neck, from the base of the 

 lower mandible. I much regret that there is not at present in the Acad. Mus. a 

 series of specimens of this species, sufficient for comparison with those in the 

 present collection, which, according to my recollection, are larger than usual, 

 I860.] 




376 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



and especially stronger in the bill. All the specimens of this species, except 

 one, and specimens of various other species of this group, were stolen by a 

 visitor to the Acad. Mus. some years since, and never recovered. 



Several specimens, in excellent plumage and condition, are in Mr. Swift's 

 collection.

 This is undoubtedly the true Motacilla petechia, Linnseus, founded on the 

 description of Ficedula martinicana, by Brisson, as above cited. Though we 

 have frequently seen this species in collections, Mr. Swift's specimens are 

 the first that have come under our notice, the locality of which is authentic. 

 Numerous specimens in Mr. Swift's collection are in various plumages, 

 though the greater number are nearly or quite mature, and show the reddish 

 chesnut-colored crown quite well defined and conspicuous. This bird is 

 larger than D. cestiva of tbe United States, with which it has sometimes been 

 confounded, and is not difficult to recognize from Brisson's excellent descrip- 

 tion above cited. It is the same bird also as Brisson's Ficedula pensylvanica 

 erythrocephalos, founded on Edwards' figure, above referred to, who (Edwards) 

 expressly states that he did not know the locality of the specimen figured, 

 but guessed, wrongly, that another, received from Pennsylvania, was the 

 female of the same species. Hence concluding erroneously that his bird was 

 a North American species. This erroneous guess and conjectural conclusion 

 misled Brisson, Buffon, and a host of other authors, to the present era, but is 

 easily detected by referring to the text of Edwards, vol. v. p. 99.

 respects with specimens in the Acad. Mus., which we have hitherto regarded 

 as certainly the species to which this name is applicable, but we cannot,

 islands of the West Indies. The present specimens are identical with the bird 

 which is abundant on the coast of New Jersey, and in much the same plumage 

 seen in September, or later in the autumn. 



The proper name for this species, I have no doubt, is that here given. The 

 figure in Buffon, as cited, probably represents an autumnal or winter plumage.

Descriptions of new species of Crinoidea and Echinoidea from the Carboniferous

BY F. B. MEEK AND A. H. WORTI1EN, 

 Of the Illinois State Geological Survey. 



Although we have not jet had time to write out full remarks upon the 

 relations of the species described in this paper, we would state that we have 

 compared them carefully, not merely with figures and descriptions, but witli 

 authentic specimens of a large majority of the known American Carboniferous 

 species. In comparing them with the forms figured and described in the Iowa 

 Report, as well as with a large number of other Western Carboniferous forms 

 named and described, though not yet published, by Prof. Hall, we have pos- 

 sessed the advantage of having at hand, in almost every instance, the original 

 types of those species which belong to, and are now in the possession of one 

 of the authors.* 



Full illustrations of all the species, together with remarks, comparisons and 

 extended descriptions will appear in the forthcoming report of the Geological

Platycrinus Prattenanus. Calyx small, wider than high, distinctly trun- 

 cated below and widening gradually upwards, composed of thick, smooth, 

 slightly convex plates, which are united, (excepting the basal series) by 

 grooved sutures. Base comparatively large, more than one-tbird as high, as 

 wide, and provided with a small rim arouad the margin of the broad truncated 

 under side; consisting of one pentagonal, and two hexagonal plates, the upper 

 side of the latter being concave in the middle, and about twice as long as the 

 superior lateral slopes ; sutures carinated, the carinas passing down over the mar- 

 ginal rim of the under side. Columnar facet large, or more than half as wide 

 as the base, and slightly concave. First radial plates a little wider than high, 

 quadrangular, nearly as wide at the base as above, somewhat convex on the

 Iowa Report, in which we see he describes other species not contained in the collec- 

 tions alluded to above. We have carefully compared his descriptions of these additional 

 species with ours, described in this paper, and believe them to be all distinct, unless our 

 Dichocrinus conus may be identical with his D. lavis.

under side, and provided with a rather broad rounded sinus above for the re- 

 ception of the second radials, the lower margin of the excavation being but 

 very s//ghtly projecting. Second radial pieces small, much wider than long, 

 triaDgular, and about filling the sinus in the upper side of each first radial ; 

 concave on their upper sloping sides, which support the primary divisions of 

 the arms. (Anal and interradial pieces unknown.) 



The arms, after the first division on the second radial plate, bifurcate again 

 on the second piece, and at least two of the inner of these subdivisions, divide 

 once more on the second piece, (in two of the arms examined). Above these last 

 divisions each arm is slender, nearly cylindrical, and consists of a single series 

 of plates for a short distance, then gradually passes into a double alterna- 

 ting series. The tentacles are closely arranged, and rather thick, where they 

 connect with the arm pieces, but soon taper, and appear to be all made up of 

 long slender joints. 



Height from the base to the summit of the first radials, 0-35 in ; breadth at 

 the top of first radials, 0.45 inch; breadth of base, 0-37 inch; height of do., 

 0-13 inch ; height of first radials, 0-24 inch.

 Survey of Illinois. 



Locality and position. Randolph County, Illinois. St. Louis, Limestone of

Platycrinus penicillcs. Body small, subglobose, a little wider than long, 

 Composed of thin plates, connected by moderately distinct sutures, and orna- 

 mented by small tubercles or coarse granules, which, on the first radial plates, 

 show a tendency to range themselves in a few radiating rows from the middle 

 of the upper side. Base comparatively large, much depressed, considerably 

 wider than high, and broadly truncate, with a marginal rim below. First 

 radial pieces large, nearly flat, and a little higher than wide; widening some- 

 what from the base, subquadrangular, the upper angles being slightly truncate 

 by the interradial and anal pieces ; sinus in the upper side for the reception of 

 the second radial pieces shallow, and apparently about half as wide as the 

 superior edge. Second radials small, triangular, wider than long, and support- 

 ing on their upper sloping edges the first divisions of the arms. (Anal and 

 interradial pieces unknown.) 



Above the first bifurcation on the second radial pieces, the two divisions of 

 the arms subdivide on the second piece, and the two middle subdivisions each 

 bifurcate again on the second piece, beyond which they are all simple. Imme- 

 diately above the last bifurcations, the arms consist of a single series of pieces 

 which are somewhat wedge-shaped, or alternately longer and shorter on op- 

 posite sides ; then gradually pass into a double series of alternating joints 

 above. The larger single arm pieces, below the bifurcations, and for a short 

 distance above, are generally longer than wide, narrow around the middle, and 

 broader at each extremity, the superior lateral angles projecting for the recep- 

 tion of tentacles. All the larger arm pieces are connected by peculiar undu- 

 lating sutures. 



The column is comparatively large, and seems to have been very flexible. 

 Near the body it is rounded and composed of thin alternately larger and 

 smaller segments, with sharp edges, which are often crennlated. Farther down 

 it becomes alternately compressed in opposite directions, at intervals of about 

 every five joints ; while all the joints increase somewhat in thickness, and are 

 ornamented with distinct spine-like projecting points or crenulations. About 

 every fifth segment is more prominent on its edges than the others. 



Length of body from base to the summit of the first radials, 0-21 inch

slightly granulose plates. Base basin-shaped, expanding rapidly from its small 

 truncated columnar facet, considerably wider than high, and provided with 

 carinated sutures. First, radial plates large, about as high as wide, subquad- 

 rangular in outline, the two superior angles being rather distinctly truncated 

 for the reception of the interradial pieces ; all nearly, or quite as wide below as 

 above, and provided with a rounded sinus in the upper edge equal to about 

 half their own breadth, for the reception of the second radial pieces. Second 

 radials very small, triangular, about half as long as wide, and supporting en 

 their superior sloping sides, which are distinctly concave, the first divisions of 

 the arms. (Anal plates unknown). Interradial pieces comparatively large, 

 and each provided with a rather distinct central spine or tubercle. 



The arms are rather small, and above the first division on the second radial 

 piece, bifurcate again on the second piece, beyond which they appear to 

 be simple in most cases, though some of them present the appearance of sub- 

 dividing again on the second piece. Above the last bifurcation, they are at 

 first composed of a single series of joints, but gradually pass into a double al- 

 ternating series. All the joints below the bifurcations, and some of the larger 

 single ones above, are rather long, constricted around the middle, and provided 

 with a prominent projection on each side above. 



The column is compressed, twisted, and composed of nearly equal, rather short 

 segments, which are occasionally armed with short conical nodes or spines. 



Height from the base to the summit of the first radials, 0-43 inch ; breadth, 

 0-58 inch ; breadth of base, 0-45 inch ; height of do.. 015 inch.

Genus DICHOCRINUS, Munster. 



Dichocrincs constkictus. Body small, oval subglobose, widest above, con- 

 stricted a little below the middle, and rounded or slightly truncate beneath ; 

 composed of thick plates, which appear to have been smooth, and are joined by 

 linear sutures. Base comparatively large, or forming about one-third the 

 entire length of the body, twice as wide as high, and more or less concave in 

 the middle below; each of its pieces having five obscure angles above, with 

 slight concavities between for the reception of the succeeding range of plates ; 

 columnar facet very small and round. First radial plates higher than wide, a 

 little unequal, having an oblong subquadrangular outliue, the two upper angles 

 of each being slightly truncated, apparently for the reception of very small 

 interradial pieces; one of them having a fifth obscure angle in the middle of 

 the under side. Sinus in the upper side of each first radial for the reception of 

 the second radials, rounded, and from one-third to one-half the breadth of these 

 plates. Anal piece slightly larger than the first radials, and having a subpenta- 

 gonal outline, narrowing upwards a little, and like the first radials, curving 

 inward above. (Other parts unknown.) 



Length, 0-39 inch ; breadth above the middle, 0-38 inch; do. at the constric- 

 tion below the middle, 032 inch; breadth of base, 0-33 inch; height of do., 

 0-14 inch. 



Locality and position. Bloomington, Indiana ; in beds probably equivalent to 

 the Warsaw Limestone, of the subcarboniferous series. 



Dichocrinds conus. Body large, obconical, longer than wide, composed of 

 thin, smooth plates, which are united by close fitting, linear sutures. Base 

 comparatively large, a little longer than wide, tapering regularly to the small 

 inferior extremity, which is slightly truncate ; both pieces subtrigonal in out- 

 line, though really hexagonal, if we count the slightly salient angles between 

 the shallow sinuosities in theupper margins ; columnar facet small, round ? and 

 provided with a small rim. Radial pieces large, longer than wide, presenting 

 an oblong outline, slightly wider above than at the base; all more or less con- 

 vex on the inferior margins, which in the anterior one, is provided with an 

 obtuse central angle ; sinus in the upper margin of each, about one-third as wide

as the superior edge, and excavated down nearly one-fifth the length of the 

 plate its lower edge projecting distinctly outward. Anal plate hexagonal, as 

 long as the radials, but a little narrower, about twice as high as wide. 



Each radial plate, as well as the anal piece, has an obscure rounded ridge 

 extending down the middle to its base, so as to give the body a slightly sub- 

 lifixagomtl outline when viewed from below. These prominences are also con- 

 tinued on. down upon the basal pieces, gradually becoming obsolete as they 

 converge toward the narrow lower extremity.

Dichocrinus (Pterotccrinus*) crassds. Body below the arms of medium size 

 basin-shaped, or more than twice as wide as high, widening rapidly upwards 

 from the base, and composed of thick, apparently, smooth plates, which are 

 very slightly convex, and connected by linear sutures. Base comparatively 

 large, about four times as wide as high, distinctly concave below, and widening 

 upwards from its rounded lower margin ; subcircular in outline, being scarcely 

 impressed at the sutures ; columnar facet round, coneave, and about one-fourth 

 as wide as the base. First radial plates broader than long, widening regularly 

 upwards from the base, and all concave on the upper side, which is longer than 

 either of the others ; four of them quadrangular, and one on the anterior side 

 probably subpentagonal, from the presence of a fifth obscure angle at the 

 middle of the under side. Second radial pieces very small, about twice 

 as wide as long, subtrigonal in outline, and supporting on their superior 

 sloping sides, (which are a little concave,) the two middle arms, while the two 

 lateral' arms rest partly upon their wedge-shaped lateral extremities, and in 

 part directly upon the first radials. The anal piece is rather more than half as 

 large as the first radial plates, a little longer than wide, (the lateral margins 

 being nearly parallel or slightly convex in outline,) and presenting a subquad- 

 rangular form, with a fifth obscure angle at the middle of the base. 



* This and the first of the following species, evidently belong to the same group as the 

 species upon which Mr. Lyon proposed, in the third volume of the Geological Pur- 

 vey of Kentucky, to found a new genus under the name of Asterocrinus (Pterolocnnus, 

 Lyon & Casseday). The species of which it is composed present marked differences 

 from what are regarded as typical species of Dichocrinus in the old world, and we have 

 little doubt in regard to the propriety of separating them from that genus. As there are, 

 however, some differences of opinion, amongst paleontologists, in relation to the limits 

 of the genus Dichocrinus, we have concluded to place our species in the group 1 teroto- 

 vrinus, using tne name provisionally, however, for the present, in a subgenenc sense. 



Judging from the few species of this group we have yet seen, we are led to think the 

 formula given by Messrs. Lyon and Casseday, in their paper published in the American 

 Journal of Science, (January, 1859,) should be modified somewhat. In one of our species 

 there is a minute triangular piece resting upon the middle of each first radial, and 

 partly supporting on its superior sloping sides the two pieces regarded in Messrs. Lyon 

 and Casseday's formula as the second radial. In another of our species this minute 

 piece is represemed by a larger one of the same form, which undoubtedly bears the re- 

 lations to the other parts, of a dwarfed, but true second radial; while those resting upon, 

 and partly upon it, assume the character of secondary radials and free arm pieces. 

 Hence we think this minute piece (which is sometimes wanting), however small it may 

 be, should always be regarded as a rudimentary second radial piece. If we are correct 

 in these views, the formula of this group should be stated as follows : 



Basal pieces, 2. 



Radials 1 or 2X5, the second being very small, minute, or sometimes obsolete. 



Secondary radials. 1 X 10, or wanting; the first free arm pieces sometimes resting 

 partly on the second and partly on the first radials ; and where the small second radia! 

 and the secondary radials are wantinsr, all resting directly upon the first. 



Arms, 20. 



Interradials unknown. 



Intcrbrachia] appendages 5, large, and more or less expanded.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, 3S3 



The first arm pieces are much larger than the others, and consist of a single 

 series ; but above these the arms soon pass into a double series of small 

 alternating pieces, which are considerably wider than long, and support 

 on the inner side a double series of closely arranged tentacles. The 

 arms, of which there are four to each ray, or twenty in the entire series, 

 are rounded on the outside, and deeply grooved within, slightly taper- 

 ing, apparently rather long, and entirely simple. The interbrachial appendage, 

 rising from the middle of each group of arms, is thin or knife-like, and 

 seems to have been nearly as long as the arms. 



Locality and position. Hardin County, Illinois. Chester Limestone, of sub- 

 carboniferous series. 



Dichocrinus (Pterotocri.vos) Chesterensis. Body below the arms rather 

 small, basin-shaped, or more than twice as wide as high, widening rapidly up- 

 wards from the base, the sides being slightly concave in outline ; composed of 

 moderately thick, apparently smooth plates, which are connected by linear 

 sutures. Base more than one-third as broad as the body, about three times as 

 wide as high, truncate and concave below, the concavity being margined by an 

 angular rim; columnar facet small, or less than one-third as broad as the trun- 

 cated under side of the base. First radial plates about the size of the basal 

 pieces, though proportionally higher, twice as wide as long, and widening 

 rather rapidly from below ; four of them quadrangular, and one on the anterior 

 side, pentagonal; all distinctly concave on the upper side, (which is longer 

 than either of the others) and having their salient lateral angles above slightly 

 truncated, apparently for the reception of small interradial pieces. Second 

 radial pieces minute, or merely rudimentary, triangular, and each partly 

 supporting on its sloping upper edges two larger secondary radial pieces, 

 which also rest with one side on the primary radials, and bear upon their 

 superior sloping sides the first brachial pieces, the outer of which, like- 

 wise have one edge reposing upon the lateral superior edge of the first radial 

 plates. Anal piece about one-third as large as the primary radials, ovate in 

 form, the upper extremity being very narrow, and the long lateral margin 

 convex, while its base has an obtuse angle on each side, and one in the middle. 



The arms, of which there are four to each ray, or twenty in the entire range, 

 are simple from their origin, rounded on the outside, deeply grooved within, 

 and commence as a single series of larger pieces, but soon pass into a double 

 alternating series of small pieces, which support on their inner sides two ranges 

 of tentacles. The interbrachial appendages, if there are any in this species, are 

 unknown. 



Height from base to summit of first radial pieces, 0-16 inch ; breadth at the 

 top of first radials, 0-40 inch ; breadth of base, 0-24 inch ; height of do., 0-16

* In first sending on the description of this species to the Academy, we had proposed 

 to found upon it a subgenus, which we placed provisionally under Aoanthocj inus, stating, 

 at the same time, that it presented differences from the type of that genus, that might 

 be of full generic value. As this paper is going through the press, we have received a 

 copy of Prof. Hall's Supplement to the Iowa Report (just published), in which we see he 

 has described four species of this type under the name of Trematocrinus. We there- 

 fore cancel, in lhe proof of our paper, the description of the group, and refer our 

 species, which is clearly distinct, specifically, from the forms described by Prof, Hall, 

 to his genus Trematocrinus. 



In our remarks (now cancelled) on this group, we had pointed out its relations not only 

 to Acanthocrinus, but also to Rhodocrinus, Miller, and to Goniasteroidocrinus of Lyon 

 and Casseday. Its analogy to the latter is so striking, that we strongly suspect the same

almost vertically to near the arms, where they curve a little outwards. Plates 

 nearly smooth or subgranulose, and all convex, chose of the subovate inter- 

 radial spaces less prominent than the rays, and showing a very slight tendency 

 to develope obscure ridges, one of which passes to each side; sutures mode- 

 rately distinct. Base small, entirely within the concavity of the underside, 

 concave, and obscurely pentagonal ; columnar facet large, or occupying 

 nearly the whole area of the base, obscurely marked by radiating stria?, and 

 provided with a small penatgonal star-shaped central opening. Subradial 

 pieces as wide as long, truncated, and narrower above than below, subquad- 

 rangular in outline , but provided with a fifth very obtuse angle in the middle 

 below, and having each inferior lateral angle slightly truncated. First radial 

 pieces larger than the subradials, and wedged so far in between them as to 

 come nearly in contact with the base, about as wide as long, heptagonal, the 

 sides connecting with subradials being longer than the others. Second radials 

 hexagonal, as long as wide. Third radials heptagonal, and supporting on their 

 superior sloping sides the first secondary radials, each of which is succeeded by 

 two others, the last of which supports the first true brachial piece. 



The first interradial pieces rest upon the superior truncated side of the sub- 

 radials, which are about equal in size ; they are all hexagonal, the inferior 

 lateral edges being very short, and the UDder side longer than either of the 

 others. Above these there are in the second range three, in the third three 

 or four, and in the fourth three pieces, the latter being surmounted by three 

 or four others ; all the series diminish gradually from below to the summit. 

 (Anal plates unknown.) 



The interbracbial pieces are all very small, two of them being wedged down 

 in the narrow space between the first and second secondary radial pieces, 

 while the others are arranged so as to form the upper and inner side of the 

 two small ambulacral apertures the outer and lower sides of which are 

 formed partly by a sinus in the edge of the second secondary radial pieces, 

 and parti}' by one side of the third. 



The secondary radials diverge so that those belonging to different rays meet, 

 over the centre of each interradial space, where the arms of which there 

 appear to be ten, arise. The first brachial pieces are not quite free, being 

 flanked on either side by the interbracbial pieces, forming the summit of the 

 apertures. They are all pierced directly through the middle by the arm 

 openings. 



The summit is very slightly convex, and composed of unequal plates, the 

 larger of which are tumid, and the smaller less convex. Extending from 

 each arm, towards the middle, there is a depression occupied by smaller 

 pieces, while the larger and more convex plates occupy the prominences be- 

 tween. The specimen examined being a little defective on one side, the exact 

 position of the anal opening, if any exists, cannot be determined. 



Height to top of first brachial pieces, 0-48 inch ; do. to ambulacral apertures.

Genus ACTINOCRINUS, Miller. 

 Actinocrinus validus. Body of medium size, subglobose, being more de- 

 pressed above than below the arms ; calyx somewhat ventricose, and formed 

 of thick, convex, radiately costate plates, connected by moderately distinct 

 sutures ; summit composed of small irregular tuberculose pieces, and provided 



ambulacral openings may exist in the type of that genus, and that in consequence of the 

 ;mperfection of their specimens, Messrs Lyon and Casseday may have failed to see 

 them. If so, all the species will probably have to be ranged under their name, which 

 was first published, unless when the characters and limits of Acanthocrinus are better 

 known, it may be found that these American forms should only constitute a section of 

 that genus. Prof. Hal] seems to have overlooked the almost exact identity in the 

 generic formula of his group with that given of Goniaslcroidocrinus.

with a subcentral proboscis ; interradial spaces between the arms deeply exca- 

 vated. Base rather small, truncated and concave below, about four times as 

 wide a3 high, not provided with a continuous rim; composed of somewhat un- 

 equal plates, with deeply grooved sutures between ; columnar facet nearly two- 

 thirds as broad as the base, concave, and marked by fine radiating striae. First 

 radial plates a little wider than high, two of them hexagonal, and three hepta- 

 gonal, the angle at the middle of the lower side of each being very obtuse. Sec- 

 ond radials wider than long, hexagonal and heptagonal, about one-half to two- 

 thirds as large as the first radials, and like them ranging obliquely outward 

 and upward from the base. Third radial pieces, smaller than the second, from 

 which they extend almost horizontally outwards ; arcuate transversely, their 

 lateral extremities curving up to connect with the superior arm pieces, hexa- 

 gonal, and each supporting on its superior (_or more properly its outer) sloping 

 sides two secondary radial pieces, which also extend out horizontally from the 

 body. 



The first anal piece is nearly as large as the first radials, about as wide as 

 long, hexagonal, and supports on its superior sloping sides two smaller hexa- 

 gonal and heptagonal pieces in the second range ; above these there are in the 

 next range, three or four smaller pieces, which connect with the vault and 

 superior arm pieces above and on each side. The first interradial plates are 

 about the size of the second radials, as long as wide, heptagonal (and hexago- 

 nal) and support two or three smaller pieces in the next range. 



Of the distinct radiating costse on the first radial plates, from three to four 

 pass across from one to the other, and from each to the base, and one or two 

 to the second radial, and each first interradial above ; while the third radials 

 are destitute of costae. 



Height from base to summit of third radials, 0-65 inch ; do., to top of vault. 

 0'95 inch ; breadth (across between the arms) 0-91 inch ; breadth of base 0-42

 Limestone of lower carboniferous series. 



Actinocrinds asteriscus. Body about medium size, depressed or subdiscoidal, 

 rather more convex below than above the arms ; calyx expanding rapidly from 

 the base about half way up, then flaring outwards so as to bring the third ra- 

 dials and succeeding pieces nearly upon a horizontal plane, composed of thin, 

 nearly smooth flattened plates, which are joined by close fitting sutures; sum- 

 mit much depressed, consisting of numerous medium-sized, convex plates, and 

 provided with a subcentral proboscis ; interradial spices deeply excavated, so as 

 to give the body a distinctly pentalobate outline, as seen from above or below. 

 Base small, apparently rounded and destitute of a marginal rim, about threo 

 times as wide as high. First radial plates wider than long, expanding from below 

 to the lateral angles, three of them hexagonal, and two heptagonal, the angle at 

 the middle of the base of the latter being very obtuse. Second radials small, 

 about twice as wide as long, hexagonal and pentagonal. Third radials slightly 

 larger than the second, pentagonal, or occasionally hexagonal about twice as 

 wide as high, and each supporting on its superior (or more properly, outer) 

 sloping sides, two secondary radials ; these are each succeeded by another, 

 which in its turn, supports two of the first brachial pieces, making four arms 

 to each ray, or twenty in the whole series, all of which seem to rise vertically 

 from the point of attachment. 



The first anal piece is small, longer than wide, hexagonal, and supports on 

 each superior lateral edge a small pentagonal piece, and on its truncated 

 upper end a long, narrow, irregular plate, which extends up and curves 

 inwards with its superior extremity between two of the crown plates. On each 

 side of the latter there is a large irregular curved piece, belonging, probably, 

 to the anal series. The first interradial plates are larger than the first anal 

 piece, and as wide as, or wider than long, hexagonal or heptagonal, and each 

 supports on its superior lateral sloping edges smaller pieces, above which 



1860.J 




386 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



there are usually three, or occasionally four, irregular elongated pieces, similar 

 to the upper of the anal series. Sometimes the middle one of these three 

 pieces extends down between the others, so as to rest upon a short, truncated, 

 upper end of the first interradial piece. (Other parts unknown.) 



Height from base to top of vault, 0-47 inch ; do. to arms, 037 inch ; breadth 

 across, from side to side, between the interradial 0-66 inch. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Actinocrinus speciosus. Body large, below the arms obconical, longer than 

 wide, composed of convex, ornately co3tate plates, which are joined by more or 

 less excavated sutures. Base of moderate size, cup-shaped, nearly as wide 

 again as high, truncate below, and expanding rather rapidly upward, composed 

 of regular subequal hexagonal plates, with broadly and deeply grooved sutures. 

 Columnar facet rather large, or nearly equaling one- half the breadth of the 

 base, flat, marked by obscure radiating strife, and provided with a very small 

 continuous rim ; perforated by a round central opening about one-third the 

 diameter of the column at its junction with the body. First radial plates large, 

 longer than wide, three hexagonal, and two heptagonal, generally widest a 

 little above the middle. Second radials considerably smaller than the first, 

 about as wide as long, and apparently all hexagonal. Third radials a little 

 smaller than the second, wider than long, heptagonal, (and octagonal ?) each 

 supporting on its superior sloping sides two smaller heptagonal or octagonal 

 secondary radials, which appear to have each supported two brachial pieces ; 

 resting upon and between the two secondary radials, there is a small hexagonal 

 interbrachial [piece, which appears to have supported two others on its upper 

 sloping sides. 



The first anal plate, which is nearly as large as the first radials, is heptagonal, 

 longer than wide, and supports in the first range three much smaller pieces, 

 the middle one of which, is pentagonal, and the others hexagonal; above these 

 in the next range, there are four, and in the third, apparently three pieces, 

 which is as far as they can be traced in the specimen examined. 



The first interradial plates are slightly larger than the second radials, hexa- 

 gonal, and each surmounted by two smaller pieces ; above these there are, 

 apparently, about three other ranges of two small pieces each. 



The surface of the plates is neatly ornamented by narrow, sharply elevated 

 ribs, about four to six of which radiate from the central region of each first 

 radial plate to each of its sides, excepting below the middle, where there are 

 usually about eight to ten. The costae on the other plates are less numerous 

 in proportion to the size of each, and like those on the first radials, extend to 

 the sides, those crossing any one side being all arranged parallel to each other 

 so as to form with those on the adjacent plates a series of concentric equila- 

 teral triangles. Sometimes these costas are irregularly interrupted, or more or 

 less notched, especially on the upper plates ; and on some of the upper inter- 

 radial pieces they show a tendency to become irregularly broken up into little 

 spine-like projections.

 sides from the base to the third radials, above which the secondary radial, and 

 first brachial pieces extend out horizontally, leaving excavated interradial 

 spaces between the clusters of arms ; sutures close fitting. Base of moderate 

 size, more than twice as wide as high, truncated, and distinctly concave below, 

 where it is as wide as at the summit ; margin so deeply notched at the sutures 

 as to present a distinctly trilobate appearance as seen from below ; columnar 

 facet rounded, aboxit one-third as wide as the base, and provided with a mi-

 node extending obliquely outwards and downwards, from which one or two 

 moderately prominent ridges pass down upon the basal plates. Second radials 

 between one-half and two-thirds as large as the first, distinctly convex, or 

 each rising into a small node ; about one-third wider than high, two of them 

 pentagonal, and three hexagonal. Third radials as wide as the second, but 

 rather shorter, three of them pentagonal and two heptagonal, supporting on 

 each of their superior sloping sides a slightly smaller secondary radial piece, 

 each of which is surmounted by two brachial pieces ; making, apparently, 

 twenty arms in the entire range. 



The first interradial pieces are about as large as the second radials, and like 

 them provided with a central node ; they are as long as wide, regularly hexa- 

 gonal, and support on their superior sloping sides two smaller pieces in the 

 second range, and two or three in the third, which connect on each side with 

 the secondary radial, and first brachial pieces. The first anal plate is nearly 

 as large as the first radials, as long as wide, hexagonal, and supports in the 

 second range, two rather smaller pieces, one of which is hexagonal, and the 

 other heptagonal ; above these there are two others, which connect with the 

 third radials, and secondary radial pieces on each side, and are surmounted 

 by two or three small, irregular pieces, which are flanked on either side by 

 the brachial pieces, and connect with those of the summit above. 



The vault is composed of irregular, moderately convex pieces, of various 

 forms, and provided with a subcentral proboscis, which rises abruptly from its 

 surface. 



Height from the base to the summit of the vault, - 66 inch ; do. to top of 

 third radials on the anterior side, 0-44. Breadth of base, 0'34 inch ; height 

 of do., 0*14 inch ; breadth across the summit, between the interradial spaces 

 on opposite sides, 0"61 inch. 



Locality and position. Cedar Creek, Warren County, Illinois. Burlington 

 Limestone, of the subcarboniferous series. 



Actinocrinps araneolus. Body small, much depressed, stelliform, nearly 

 equally convex above and below the arms, with deeply excavated interradial 

 spaces ; composed of smooth or obscurely granulose, convex plates, which are 

 strongly angular below the arms ; sutures moderately distinct. Base small, 

 fiat and subhexagonal ; columnar facet small, round, flat, and about one-third, 

 as wide as the base, pierced by a small central opening. First radial pieces on 

 a plane with the base, strongly convex, and angular in the middle, from which 

 a more or less angular ridge radiates to each of the sides, all slightly broader 

 than long, and hexagonal or heptagonal, the seventh angle at the middle of 

 the side connecting with the base being very obtuse. Second radial pieces 

 nearly as large as the first, wider than long, distinctly curved upwards at the 

 sides, and subangular along the middle ; presenting a hexagonal outline as 

 seen from below, but possessing an additional angle on each side, only seen in 

 a lateral view. Third radials of the same size as the second, from which they 

 extend horizontally outwards ; curving distinctly upwards on each side, and pen- 

 tagonal as seen from below, but each having one or two additional angles on 

 each side, where they connect with the superior arm pieces extending out from 

 the vault ; supporting on their superior, or more properly outer, sloping sides 

 apparently the first brachial pieces. 



The interradials are about two-thirds as large as the first radial pieces, a 

 little longer than wide, regularly hexagonal, and each support on their supe- 

 rior sloping sides two smaller pieces, which seem to belong more properly to 

 the vault, than the interradial series. 



The first anal plate is near two-thirds as large as the first radial, hexagonal, 

 and supports two smaller hexagonal pieces in the next range ; above these 

 there are four others in the third range, which connect with those of the vault 

 above, and with the superior arm pieces on each side. 



The summit is composed of small, somewhat irregular pieces, some of which

are tumid, and a few that extend out over the third radials become subconical. 

 The proboscis is subcentral, of medium size, and rises abruptly from the much 

 depressed vault. (Other parts unknown.) 



Height, 0*22 inch ; breadth across the disk, between the interradial spaces 

 on opposite sides, 0*33 ; do., between the third radials on opposite sides, 0"54 

 inch ; breadth of base, 0*14 inch. 



Locality and position. Burlington, Iowa. Burlington Limestone, of the

Actinockinds ( Amphokacrintjs*) subtukbinattts. Body rather under me- 

 dium size, turbinate, or obconical below the arms, and depressed convex 

 above ; expanding regularly with straight sides from the column to the sum- 

 mit of the third radials, thence more abruptly to the arms ; composed of flat, 

 smooth or merely granulose plates, which are connected by close-fitting sutures. 

 Interradial and anal spaces rather distinctly excavated between the groups of 

 arms. Base comparatively small, subpentagonal, about one-third as wide as 

 high, and not provided with a projecting rim ; columnar facet concave, small 

 or less than half the diameter of the base. First radial plates generally a little 

 wider than long, widening from the base to the lateral angles, two of them 

 heptagonal and three hexagonal. Second radials small, about twice as wide 

 as high, quadrangular, or rarely with one of the upper angles slightly trunca- 

 ted so as to produce a fifth angle. Third radial pieces a little larger than the 

 second, about twice as wide as high, hexagonal and heptagonal, and support- 

 ing on each superior sloping side in the anterior and two posterior rays, one 

 (occasionally two on one side of the latter) small secondary radial piece, which 

 gives rise to two brachial pieces ; while in each of the two antero-lateral rays, 

 the two small secondary radials are truncated above, and each supports a single 

 brachial piece ; making two arms to each of these rays, and four to each of the 

 others, or sixteen to the entire series. 



The first interradial plates are about two-thirds as large as the first radials, 

 nearly as long as wide, and six to nine-sided. On the superior sloping sides 

 of these, rest two smaller pieces, which partly support the secondary radials, 

 and are surmounted by two or three irregular pieces, which extend up between 

 the groups of arms. The first anal piece is as large as the first radials, about 

 as long as wide, heptagonal, and surmounted by three smaller hexagonal 

 pieces in the second range, the middle one of which extends above the others. 

 Surmounting these there are also three pieces in the third range, the two late- 

 ral of which each supports an irregular piece above, while the middle one pro- 

 jects considerably beyond the others, and supports on its sloping sides a series 

 of protuberant plates, which surround the small anal aperture. 



The summit is composed of irregular unequal plates, one of which over each 

 arm, and another near the middle, are larger than the others, and appear to 

 have been convex, or may even have been extended into short spines. The 

 anal aperture is lateral, being located a little above the elevation of the arm 

 openings. 



Height from base to summit, 0*59 inch ; breadth across the summit between 

 the groups of arms, 0*60 inch ; do., from the arm openings on opposite sides, 



* We think. Austin's name Amphoracrimts should be retained, at least in a subgeneric 

 sense. The lateral position of ihe anal and oral opening in this group, instead of having 

 it placed in or near the centre of the vault, and extended in the form of a more or less 

 elongated proboscis, must have been accompanied by some marked difference in the 

 structure of the softer parts of the animal. Indeed it seems to us that in the classification 

 of the Crinoidea, too much importance is often given to the number and arrangement of 

 the pieces forming the cup, to the neglect of the ensemble of characters presented in the 

 structure of all parts of the animal. When we see whnt widely dissimilar species are some- 

 times brought together in the same groups, by the present classification, we cannot avoid 

 suspecting that it is, as now used, at least to some extent, analogous to the old artificial 

 Linnaean classification in botany, and that it will some day give way to a more rational 

 method that may make material modifications in the genera as we now understand them.

Genus FORBSIOCRINUS.* 



Forbsiocrinus ? Norwoodi. Body (as near as can be determined from a com- 

 pressed specimen) obconical, or enlarging regularly upwards from the col- 

 umn ; composed of nearly smooth, rather thick, flattened, or more or less 

 arcuate plates, which are connected by linear sutures. Base small, and ap- 

 parently nearly hidden by the column. Subradial plates rather irregular in 

 form, four of them pentagonal, (one of the sides being very short) and one 

 on the anal side apparently heptagonal, with unequal sides. First radial 

 pieces nearly twice as wide as long, hexagonal and heptagonal, and a little 

 arcuate transversely. Second, third and fourth radials, (and in the anterior 

 ray the fifth, ) all short, nearly of the same size, hexagonal and about twice 

 as wide as long. Fifth radial pieces (sixth in the anterior ray) of the same 

 size as the others, heptagonal, and supporting on their superior sloping sides 

 the secondary radials, only three ranges of which have been seen ; these lat- 

 ter alternate with interradials on each side, and show scarcely any tendency 

 to diverge. (Anal pieces unknown). 



Of the interradials, which are numerous, the first are nearly as large as 

 the subradials, as long as wide, hexagonal, and support three smaller pieces 

 in the second range. Above these four are seen in the next range, in one in- 

 terradial space, which is as far up as they can be counted in the specimen 

 examined, though it is evident from the breadth of the interradial spaces 

 that they must increase in number at the same rate for several ranges above. 



The column is round, comparatively thick at its connection with the base, 

 from which it tapers towards the lower extremity. It is made up of extreme- 

 ly thin segments, which fit together by interlocking crenulations, formed 

 doubtless by distinct radiating strise on their upper and lower surfaces. Its 

 central cavity is subcircular, and nearly equal to one-third the diameter of 

 the column, at a distance of one inch below its connection with the base. 



Named in honor of Prof. J. G. Norwood, of the University of Missouri. 



Locality and position. Near Nauvoo, Illinois. Keokuk Limestone of sub- 

 carboniferous series. 



Forbsiocrinus ? semiovatus. Body below the first bifurcation of the rays, 

 narrow semiovate, a little wider than long, expanding rapidly from the base 

 to the summit of the first radial pieces, above which it widens very gradually, 

 or becomes nearly cylindrical ; composed of moderately thick, smooth, or sub- 

 granulose plates, united by distinct sutures,. Basal plates (as defined in this 

 genus by Prof. Hallf) hidden by the column, if they exist. Subradials (of 

 Hall, basal of Koninck and LeHon), of moderate size, wider than long, three 

 of them on the anterior side pentagonal, the two upper sloping sides being 

 considerably longer than the lateral margins; (the other two unknown), 

 First radial plates on the anterior side, heptagonal, wider than long, the supe- 

 rior truncated edge being longer than either of the others. Second radials 

 smaller than the first, hexagonal, and nearly twice as wide as long. Third 

 and fourth radials, a little smaller than the second, wider than long, and 

 quadrangular, or obscurely hexagonal, excepting in one ray where there are 

 only four pieces, the last of which is pentagonal, or obscurely heptagonal, 

 and supports the arms ; in each of the other two rays seen, there is a fifth 

 piece, which seems to be pentagonal, and supports the arms on its superior 

 sloping sides. (Anal and interradial pieces unknown.) 



* The two species we have here referred provisionally to the genus Forbsiocrinus, will 

 probably be found to possess the characters of Onychocrinus of Lyon and Casseday ; but 

 as we have not yet seen the basal plates of either, we do not feel quite warranted in 

 separating them from Forbsiocrinus,

The arms above the first division on the fourth and fifth radials, consist of 

 a single series of pieces, are rounded on the outside, and a little broader than 

 their diameter at right angles to their outer surface. One of them is seen to 

 bifurcate again on the sixth piece, and another on the eighth, beyond which 

 they are not known to divide again. Between each two of the arm pieces, as 

 well as the primary radial plates, the minute accessory patelloid pieces, 

 pointed out by Prof. Hall in other species of this genus, are distinctly seen. 



The column is comparatively large, near the body, tapers a little down- 

 wards, and is composed, for a short distance below its connection with the 

 base, of extremely thin segments, which fit together by distinct interlocking 

 crenulations around the margins ; and a little farther down they gradually 

 become alternately thicker and thinner. A transverse section shows the 

 central cavity to be comparatively large, and distinctly pentapetalous as thus 

 seen. 



Height from the base to the top of the first radials 0-19 inch; do. from base 

 to top of fifth radials 0*41 inch; breadth at the summit of the first radials 0*35 

 inch; breadth of base - 15 inch.

 subcarboniferous series. 



Genus ZEACRINUS, Troost. 



Zeacrincs discus. Calyx below the summit of the first radial plates small, 

 subdiscoidal, or depressed, basin-shaped, about three times as wide as high. 

 composed of smooth, very slightly convex plates, which are connected by mode- 

 rately distinct sutures. Base small, flat, aud pentagonal ; columnar facet 

 equalling about two-thirds the diameter of the base, round, concave, and 

 marked by distinct radiating stria?, perforated by a round, minute central 

 aperture. Subradial plates extending nearly horizontally outward from the 

 base, so as to form a distinct pentagonal, star-shaped disk, all curving a little 

 upwards towards their outer extremities; three of them pentagonal, and two 

 hexagonal, in consequence of each having one angle slightly truncated by the 

 anal pieces. First radial plates about twice as large as the subradials, rather 

 more than half as long as wide, pentagonal, and all transversely truncate 

 above, the upper side being longer than either of the inferior sloping ed^es, 

 which are longer than the lateral margins. 



The first anal plate is elongate pentagonal, and wedged down between one 

 of the subradials, and the inferior sloping side of one of the first radial plates, 

 its lower extremity resting upon a very short side of another subradial. Of 

 the second anal pieces there are two, one of which stands upon the short trun- 

 cated superior side of one of the subradials, and is supported on its right in- 

 ferior sloping side by the first anal piece, and on the left by one of the first 

 radials; the other stands upon the upper end of the first anal piece, being also 

 partly supported on the right by one of the first radial plates, and on the left 

 by the other second anal piece. Both the second anal plates project about 

 half their length above the summit of the first radials. (Remaining parts un- 

 known.) 



Height to the summit of the first radial plates, 0-17 inch ; breadth 0-46 inch ; 

 breadth of base 0-14 inch. 



Locality and position. Sangamon county, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



Zeacrinus Teoostanus. Body rather small, depressed, basin-shaped below 

 the arms, somewhat rounded and concave on the inner side, composed of ap- 

 parently smooth plates, which are connected by linear sutures. Base verv 

 small, concave, and nearly or quite hidden by the column. Subradial plates 

 unequal in size, a little wider than long, excepting the one on the anal side, 

 four of them pentagonal, and one, which is longer than the others, heptagonal, 

 (counting the part of each connecting with the base, as one side.) First 

 radials nearly twice as wide as high, pentagonal, the superior horizontally 

 truncated edge being longer than either of the inferior sloping sides. Second

radial plates slightly larger than the first, wider than long, pentagonal, and 

 indistinctly hexagonal ; all longer on the inferior truncate side than either of 

 the others; apparently four of them supporting on their superior sloping sides 

 the first divisions of the arms, while the one on the anterior side is truncated 

 above, and succeeded by three other very short, wide pieces, upon the last of 

 which the first divisions of the arms rest. 



Only two of the anal pieces are seen in the specimen examined ; one of these, 

 which is small, occupies a position partly between the right superior sloping 

 side of the largest subanal piece, and the left inferior sloping side of one of 

 the first radials. The other connects wiih this on the left, and rests upon the 

 left upper sloping side of the large subradial piece, being apparently flanked 

 on its left side by one of the first radial pieces. 



The arms are nearly flat, or but slightly rounded on the outer side, and 

 bifurcate again, after the first division on the second radial pieces (in the 

 lateral and posterior rays), on the eighth, tenth, and eleventh pieces, and one 

 of the subdivisions again divides on the twelfth or fourteenth piece, beyond 

 which they are all simple.

Zeacrinus planobrachiatus. Body small, depressed, basin-shaped, concave 

 below, rapidly expanding upwards, composed of apparently smooth plates, 

 connected by moderately distinct sutures. Base small, and placed within the 

 concavity of the under side; columnar facet very small. Subradial pieces 

 as wide as long, or a littte wider, four pentagonal, and one on the anal side 

 hexagonal, having one angle slightly truncated. First radial pieces wider than 

 long, expanding from the base, pentagonal, the upper side being horizontally 

 truncated, and longer than either of the others. Second radial pieces nearly 

 as large as the first, presenting a triangular outline (in the posterior and lateral 

 rays), the lateral angles being probably truncated ; supporting on their 

 superior lateral sloping sides the first divisions of the arms. First anal plate 

 narrow below, and wedged down obliquely between one of the subradials and 

 the inferior sloping side of a second radial ; supporting another piece on its 

 left superior sloping side, and apparently a smaller one on its narrow truncated 

 upper extremity. 



The arms are rather flattened on the outer side, and after the first division 

 on the second radial pieces (those seen), bifurcate again on the fifth and sixth 

 pieces. Beyond this they are entirely simple, and composed of a single series 

 )f pieces, which are slightly wider than long, and alternately longer and 

 shorter on opposite sides. On the longer side they project a little above, for 

 the reception of the tentacles, which are composed of joints nearly twice as 

 long as wide. 



Height from base to summit of first radials, 0-13 inch ; breadth at the top of 

 first radials, 0-27 inch ; length of arms, from their division on the second radial 

 pieces, about 0-94 inch ; length to bifurcation on the sixth piece, 0-19 inch.

Genus CYATHOCRINUS Miller. 



Cyathocrincs Saffordi. Body subglobose, wider than high, the broadest 

 part being below the middle, unsymmetrical, the anal side being longest, and 

 most gibbous ; composed of thin, smooth plates, joined by slightly raised, 

 linear sutures. Base of moderate size, irregularly pentagonal, flat, or so slightly 

 convex as to be scarcely seen in a lateral view, consisting of unequal, sub- 

 hexagonal plates, the lateral and outer margins of which are nearly equal, 

 while the side next the column is so short as to appear to terminate in an

angle; columnar facet very small, and slightly projecting. Subradial plates 

 rather large, wider than high, four of them hexagonal (the inferior angle being 

 very obtuse or nearly obsolete), and one on the anal side, which is considerably 

 larger than the others, irregularly heptagonal. First radial plates about the 

 size of the subradials, somewhat unequal, hexagonal, generally wider than 

 long, and tapering upward from the inferior lateral angles, bordered above by 

 a slender, slightly reflexed rim ; sinus in the superior edge, for the reception 

 of the second radial piece, small. Anal plate small, about as wide as high, 

 quadrangular, and, like the first radials, provided with a marginal rim ; not pro- 

 jecting above the radial plates on each side of it.

 breadth of base, 0-45 inch.

 Cyathocrinus ? Sangamonensis. Body beneath the summit of the first radial 

 pieces semi-ovate, composed of thick, moderately convex, smooth plates, which 

 are joined by strongly defined punctured sutures. Base pentagonal, equalling 

 about half the breadth of the body, convex, and formed of equal pentagonal 

 pieces, which are a little wider than long; columnar facet round, deep, and 

 about one-third as wide as the base. Subradial pieces large, as wide as long; 

 three of them hexagonal, with their superior sloping sides slightly longer than 

 their lateral margins, which are longer than the basal edges ; and the other 

 two heptagonal, with unequal sides. First radials wider and shorter than the 

 subradial pieces, about twice as wide as high, pentagonal, and of nearly equal 

 size and form ; their upper sides being horizontally truncate, straight or slightly 

 concave, and considerably longer than either of the basal sides, which are 

 rnurh longer than the vertical lateral edges. 



The anal plate is comparatively small, longer than wide, and projects some- 

 what above the summit of the first radials. It seems to be irregularly hepta- 

 gonal or octagonal, but the exact form of its upper extremity is not distinctly 

 seen in our specimen. Its base rests upon the short upper truncated extremity 

 of one of the irregular heptagonal subradial plates, while on either side it con- 

 nects with the first radials, and is supported on its right inferior sloping mar- 

 gin by a large oblong quadrangular subanal piece. This subanal plate is 

 larger than the anal piece, and rests upon the superior sloping edges of the two 

 heptagonal subradials, while its upper oblique side supports one of the inferior 

 sloping sides of the first radial plates, on the right of the first anal piece. 

 Arms, summit, and column unknown. 



Height from the base to top of first radial pieces, 0-94 inch ; breadth about 

 1-25 inches ; diameter of columnar facet, 0-24 inch ; breadth of base, 0-64 inch

Cyathocrinus? crassus. Body below the summit of the first radial plates 

 depressed, or basin-shaped, about twice as wide as high, rounded or subtrun- 

 cate below, and composed of smooth, strong, thick, slightly convex plates 

 which are joined by well defined, punctate sutures. Base very small, or about 

 one-fourth the breadth of the body, pentagonal, concave, and apparently nearly 

 hidden by the column. Subradial plates a little wider than high, extending at 

 first nearly horizontally outwards from the base, after which they curve 

 obliquely upwards, four of them hexagonal, and one on the anal side hepta- 

 gonal; the angle at the middle of the base of each being but slightly salient. 

 First radial plates larger than the subradials, nearly twice as wide as high 

 truncated horizontally, and nearly or quite straight on the upper side, which 

 is longer than the inferior sloping edges ; four of them pentagonal, and 'one on 

 the left of the anal piece hexagonal. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 393 



The anal piece is small, apparently pentagonal, and projects distinctly above 

 the summit of the first radials, with which it connects on each side. Instead 

 of resting directly upon the upper side of one of the subradials, it is supported 

 on the upper slightly oblique truncated extremity of a very large pentagonal 

 subanal piece, which rests upon the upper sloping sides of two subradial 

 pieces, and supports the inferior sloping edge of a first radial plate on each of 

 its oblique lateral margins. 



Height from the base to the top of the first radial pieces, 0-45 inch ; breadth, 

 0'90 inch ; breadth of base, 0-23 inch ; length of subradials, 0-36 inch ; breadth 

 of do. from 0-36 to 0-40 inch ; leDgth of first radials, from 0-28 to 0-30 inch ; 

 breadth of do. from 0-35 to 0-49 inch. 



This, and the last species, together with such forms of C. spurious, C. inter- 

 medius, and C. ? pentalobus, Hall, should probably form a subgenus, bearing 

 close relations both to Poteriocrinus and Cyathocrinus. 



Locality and position. Ovan, Fulton county, Illinois. Lower Coal Measures. 



Cyathocrinus scitolus. Body below the summit of the first radial plates 

 basin-shaped, about twice as wide as high, and truncated at the base, from 

 which it expands rapidly upward ; composed of thick, strong, subgranular 

 plates, which are very convex in the middle, and deeply excavated at the 

 corners ; sutures moderately distinct. Base small, flat or truncate, on a plane 

 with the prominent portion of the subradials, so as not to be seen in a side 

 view ; columnar facet a little concave, occupying about two-thirds the area of 

 the base, and perforated by a central opening equal to one-third its own 

 diameter. Subradial pieces about as wide as long, directed obliquely outward 

 and upward from the base; four of them pentagonal and one hexagonal, there 

 being no visible angle at the middle of the under side in any of them. First 

 radials much larger than the subradial pieces, about twice as wide as high, 

 unequal, two on the anal side being shorter than the others ; all pentagonal, 

 distinctly truncate, and a little concave above, the upper side being much 

 longer than either of the others ; superior angles also slightly truncated for the 

 reception of small interradials. Anal piece small, subquadrangular, widening 

 from the base upwards, and projecting above the first radials. 



The very prominent central portions of the subradial pieces are truncated 

 below on a plane with the base, and project out horizontally from it in such 

 a manner as to form with the base a distinct five-rayed star, as seen from 

 below. From near the middle of each subradial, there is a rather obscure 

 angular ridge extending along each side of its prominent central portion to the 

 basal pieces, and another connecting with a similar ridge near the edge of each 

 first radial plate above. From the obliqueness of the upper truncated side of 

 the first radial pieces, it is manifest that the other radials must have extended 

 very obliquely outward from them. 



Height to summit of first radials, 0-32 inch ; breadth 0-66 inch ; breadth of 

 base 0-21 inch ; length of subradials, 0-21 inch; length of largest first radial 

 pieces, 0-20 inch ; breadth of do. 0-36. 



Locality and position. Burlington, Iowa. Burlington Limestone of subcar- 

 boniferous series. 



Cyathocrinus angulatus. Body of medium size, somewhat basin-shaped 

 below the arms, wider than high, truncated below, and rapidly expanding 

 upwards; composed of very thick, nearly smooth, tumid, angular plates, which 

 are united by distinct sutures. Base small, and apparently projecting a little 

 below the base of the subradials. Subradial plates as wide as high, four of 

 them pentagonal, and one on the anal side hexagonal, there being no visible 

 ano-le in the middle of any of them below. First radials larger than the sub- 

 radial pieces, about twice as wide as long, pentagonal, or subheptagonal, the 

 upper angles being sometimes slightly truncated ; all broadly truncate, and a 

 little concave above. Second radial pieces extremely short, but differing

somewhat in length. Third radials larger than the first, considerably wider 

 than long, unequal, and presenting a triangular outline, the under side being 

 longer than either of the others; supporting on their superior sloping sides 

 the first divisions of the arms. Anal piece smaller than the subradials, a little 

 narrower below than above, apparently pentagonal, though the upper side is 

 not distinctly visible in the specimen described ; extending partly above the 

 summit of the first radial plates. 



The arms are large, rounded, apparently simple, after the division on the 

 third radial piece, and composed of a single series of pieces, which are wider 

 than long, and alternately a little longer and shorter on the opposite sides. 



The plates below the second radial series are remarkable for their thickness, 

 and tumid, angular character, though the angles are not acute. On the sub- 

 radials two of these angles or ridges pass from the middle to the base, nearly 

 parallel to each other, and one to each of the first radial pieces above. On the 

 first radials there are two of these angles, both of which pass from above 

 obliquely to the base, where they connect with those on the subradial pieces, 

 giving to each first radial a bilobate appearance,

Genus POTERIOCRINUS, Miller. 



Poteriocrinus (Scaphiocrinus) decadacttlus. Body rather small, broad, 

 obconical below the arms, expanding rapidly from the base ; plates somewhat 

 thick, nearly smooth, not convex, and connected by moderately distinct, 

 sutures. Base small, convex, or about half as high as wide, pentagonal in out- 

 line as seen from below, the upper angles of the plates being rather salient. 

 Subradial plates somewhat unequal, a little wider than long, four of them 

 hexagonal, and one on the anal side heptagonal ; the upper sloping sides in all 

 longer than those beneath, which are longer than the lateral margins. First 

 radial plates about twice as long as the smaller of the subradials, four of them 

 pentagonal, and one hexagonal, all wider than long, and wider on the upper 

 horizontally truncate side than either of the others. Second radials about the 

 size of the first, pentagonal, a little wider than high, truncated below, and pro- 

 vided with a salient angle in the middle above ; supporting the arms on their 

 superior sloping sides, which are longer than the lateral margins. 



The first anal plate is large, or equalling some of the subradials in size. It 

 is irregularly hexagonal in form, and rests between the superior sloping side? 

 of two of the subradials, supporting on its right (longest) sloping side an in- 

 ferior edge of one of the first radial pieces, and connecting on the left 

 by a short vertical edge, with another first radial plate. On its upper sides it 

 supports two smaller pieces in the second range, the exact form of which can- 

 not be made out in the specimen examined. 



The arms are long, large, and robust, subcylindrical, rather unequal, and 

 appear to be all simple from their division on the second radial piece. They 

 are entirely composed of a single series of pieces, a few of the first of which 

 are longer than the others, and alternately longer and shorter on opposite 

 sides ; further up they are more regular, and shorter than wide. The 

 column is rather small, or less than the diameter of the largest arms; it is 

 round, and composed of thin, slightly unequal segments near the body. It? 

 central cavity is small, and presents a regular pentapetalous section. 



Height of body from base to the summit of second radials, 0-48 inch ; breadth 

 about 0-47 ; length of arms, apparently not less than 2-50 inches ; breadth of 

 do. from 0-11 inch to 0-16 inch.

nearly flat plates, which are connected by moderately distinct sutures. Base 

 basin-shaped, truncate below, and expanding gradually upward, about half as 

 high as wide, and composed of nearly equal pentagonal pieces; columnar facet 

 large, concave, without a projecting marginal rim, pierced by a pentapetalous 

 central opening, less than one-third the diameter of the column. Subradial 

 plates unequal, some of them as long as wide, and others wider than long, 

 three hexagonal, and two of the larger ones on the anal side, heptagonal, 

 First radials rather smaller than the subradial pieces, all wider than high, 

 pentagonal, somewhat unequal, and horizontally truncate above, the upper 

 side being longer than either of the inferior sloping sides, which are longer 

 than the lateral margins. Second radial pieces very short, apparently sub- 

 quadrangular. Third radials short, or about three times as wide as high, pen- 

 tagonal, and supporting on their superior sloping sides the main divisions of 

 the arms. 



The first anal piece is pentagonal, and rests between the two upper sloping 

 sides of two subradials. On the right it supports one inferior sloping edge of 

 a first radial plate, and connects with another anal plate on the left, which 

 rests on the superior truncated end of one of the subradials. Both of these 

 anal pieces are truncated above, and surmounted by two others, the former of 

 which cannot be made out in the specimen described. 



The arms are very long, robust, rounded, and after the first division on the 

 third radial piece, bifurcate again on the eighth, ninth, and eleventh pieces, 

 in three of the arms examined, above which they seem to be simple, and are 

 each composed of a single series of pieces. The column is composed, near the 

 body, of firmly anchylosed pieces, the sutures of which are not visible 0-20 inch 

 below its connection with the base. Its central cavity presents, in a transverse 

 section, the same pentapetalous form as the perforation of the base. 



Length from base to summit of third radial plates, 0-79 inch ; breadrh 

 about 0-62 inch; breadth of base, 0-38 inch ; height of do. 0-19 inch ; length of 

 arms, about 350 inches.

ECHINOIDEA. 

 Genus AB.CHJEOCIDARIS, McCoy. 



Arch^ocidaris mccroxatus. The only specimens of this species yet obtained, 

 consist of detached primary spines, and a few of the interambulacral plates. 

 The plates are hexagonal, wider than long, and apparently nearly smooth, or 

 only ornamented by a single row of small tubercles around the margin. Cen- 

 tral tubercle prominent, and nearly equalling one-third the greater diameter 

 of the plate, most elevated in the middle, which has a small central pit, and 

 is separated from its surrounding lower margin by a distinct annular groove. 



Primary spines long, tapering, a little compressed, or nearly round, and 

 very slightly curved above the articulating extremity, near which they swell 

 out so as to form a distinct, smooth, somewhat angular ring ; from this to the 

 articulating end, they contract abruptly ; pointed at the upper extremity, and 

 armed by rather strong, sharp, but short lateral spinules, which are directed 

 obliquely outwards and upwards. Even under a magnifier the entire surface 

 generally appears to be smooth, but when a well preserved specimen is ex- 

 amined with a good lens, in a favorable light, it is seen to be marked by ex- 

 tremely fine, obscure, closely arranged, longitudinal strise. The articulating 

 end is distinctly perforated, and transverse sections show the central cavity 

 to be comparatively large for some distance above. 



Length of one of the interambulacral plates, - 50 inch; breadth of do. 0*35

Genus'PAL^CHINUS, McCoy. 



PaljECHinits Burlingtonensis. The only specimen of this species we have 

 yet seen is too imperfect to show the exact form of the entire fossil, though 

 it seems to have been nearly spherical. It has four to five ranges of interam- 

 bulacral plates near the middle of each area, and they decrease in number to 

 three, two, and apparently at last to one at each extremity. The inner pieces 

 are wider than long, and regularly hexagonal, excepting near the upper and 

 lower extremities of the spaces, where they are about as long as wide, and 

 occasionally pentagonal ; those of the outer ranges are all pentagonal, their 

 outer margins being truncate, and crenulated for the reception of the small 

 ambulacral pieces. 



The ambulacra are narrow, or about as wide as the first range of interam- 

 bulacral plates on either side, slightly convex along the middle, and a little 

 concave at the margins. They are composed of a double alternating series of 

 very small pieces, which are two or three times as wide as long ; about five to 

 seven of them equalling the height of each contiguous interambulacral 

 plate. They are each pierced by two small rounded pores near the outer 

 margin, and all of nearly uniform size towards the extremities of the 

 ambulacral areas, but in the central or widest part they become alternately 

 wider at the inner and outer extremities ; those having their narrower end 

 outwards often wedging out to a point between the others before reaching the 

 margin of the ambulacral space. 



The surface of all the plates is ornamented by numerous regularly arranged 

 granules, two of which occupy the inner half of each ambulacral piece. 



As near as can be determined from our specimen, it must have been, when 

 entire, not less than 2'25 inches in length, and about 2 inches in breadth. 

 The largest interambulacral plates are 0'19 inch wide, and - 17 inch in height ; 

 breadth of widest part of ambulacra.

Genus MELONITES, Owen and Norwood. 



j t 



All the published figures of Melonites multipora, the type, and hitherto the 

 only known species of this genus, give a very incorrect idea of the form and 

 arrangement of its ambulacral pieces and pores. The three lateral series of 

 these pieces on each side of the two middle ranges, instead of being as repre- 

 sented, composed two of quadrangular, and one of pentagonal pieces, placed 

 in oblique transverse rows, and mounted one upon another so as to form at 

 the same time regular longitudinal ranges, are made up of irregular alter- 

 nating unequal pieces of various forms. They are also wedged in between 

 each other in such manner, and so interrupted by small intercalated pieces, 

 not properly belonging to either range, that it becomes very difficult to deter- 

 mine whether we should count them as four or as five rows, on each side of the 

 mesial suture ; or, in other words, as eight or ten rows to each ambulacrum. 

 The same irregularity also occurs in the pores, which are round, in closely 

 approximated pairs, and not arranged in regular longitudinal or transverse 

 lines, but so as to show a tendency to assume a quincunx arrangement. 



Should the gemis of Polypi, to which Lamarck first applied the name Melonites, 

 be retained, it will become necessary to give another name to the group now 

 under consideration, in which case we would propose to call it Melonechinus. 

 Although related to Palazchinus of McCoy, this genus is clearly separated by 

 the numb er and arrangement of its ambulacral pieces and pores, as well as by 



[Sept.

its more numerous and greatly thicker interambulacral plates. The much 

 broader and more deeply sulcated arnbulacral areas of the two species now 

 known, also give them a peculiar melon-like form, quite unlike any of the 

 known species of Palcechinus. 



Melonites Dan^. Test large, subglobose, apparently slightly longer than 

 wide. Interambulacral areas lance-oval in form, convex, and occupied by 

 eight ranges of plates near the middle, where all, excepting those of the two 

 outer ranges are a little wider than high, and regularly hexagonal ; towards 

 the upp'-r and lower extremities of these spaces, the plates diminish in size 

 and numbers, and become proportionally higher, a few of them assuming a 

 pentagonal, or even a rhombic quadrangular outline. Those of the two lateral 

 ranges ail subpentagonal, their outer margins being somewhat rounded, 

 and more or less indented for the reception of the outer extremities of the 

 small arnbulacral pieces. Plates apparently all of uniform thickness, the 

 larger ones being about as thick as high, while the thickness of the smaller 

 grea'ly exceeds their diameter in any other direction. Arnbulacral areas 

 about half as wide as the interambulacral spaces, convex in the middle, and 

 broadly, as well as rather deeply sulcate along each side. Arnbulacral pieces 

 in four ranges, with some irregular intercalated smaller pieces between ; those 

 of the different ranges alternating, and all wider than high, as well as quite 

 irregular in form and size. Those composing the two inner ranges generally 

 four or five times as wide as high, but varying considerably in height. Usually 

 about four to five of the outer ranges, (which are of the same height, but only 

 half as wide as the inner, ) equal the height of each of the contiguous lateral 

 interambulacral plates. 



The intercalated pieces start from the zigzag suture between the two outer 

 ranges of arnbulacral pieces, and extend outward and inward between them, 

 but wedge out, or terminate abruptly, before reaching the outer margins, 

 or the middle of the arnbulacral areas. The pores are in pairs, two to each 

 piece, and arranged in four double rows, two on each side of the mesial 

 ridge or convexity of each ambulacrum. The entire surface is ornamented 

 by regularly disposed granules, about twenty to thirty-five of which may be 

 counted on each of the larger interambulacral plates, and as many, in propor- 

 tion to size, on each of the smaller ones, including the arnbulacral pieces. 



Height, 4 inches; breadth, about 3*80 inches ; breadth of one of the largest 

 interambulacral plates, 0'24 inch; height of do. 0"18 inch; thickening, 0-17 

 inch. 



This species attains about the same srze as, and very closely resembles, Melo- 

 nites multipora of Owen and Norwood, but may be at once distinguished by 

 having only four rows of ambrrlaeral pieces, and four double ranges of pores, 

 while M. multipora has uniformly double this number, both of pieces, and of 

 ranges of pores. 



We take great pleasure in dedicating this noble echinoid to Prof. James D. 

 Dana, of New Haven, Connecticut, one of the most profoundly learned of

Observations upon the Form of the Occiput in the various Racas of Men. 



BY J. AITKEN MEIGS, M. D. 



In 1S57, the collection of Human Crania in the Museum of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, contained 1,045 specimens of many different 

 races of men. Since that time, by presentation, deposit and exchange, this total 

 has been increased to 1,125. Eighty additions, therefore, have been made 

 during the past three years. Of this number 27 are North American Indians ;

 ques ans ; 1 Feejee; 2 Swedes; 2 Thugs; 1 Hindoo; 1 Tchuktchi ; 1 Ice- 

 lander ; 1 Cossack and 2 Negroes. 



The donors and depositors of these crania are Drs. W. S. W. Ruschenberger, 

 Thomas J. Turner, J. E. Seniple, and H. B. Trist, of the United States Navy ; 

 Drs. E. H. Abaddie and J. Letterman, of the United States Army; Prof. Wm.

 Jackson, and Messrs. George Gibbs, John Biddle, N. P. Buckley, Charles C. 

 Abbott, and the writer of this article. 



Forty-six of these crania were procured some of them with considerable 

 difficulty by my enterprising friend and former school-mate, Passed Assistant 

 Surgeon Thomas J. Turner, chiefly during his cruise in the Pacific. It affords 

 me much pleasure to acknowledge, thus publicly, the value of his indefatiga- 

 ble and intelligent efforts to promote the interests of craniographic science. 

 The thanks of those interested in this important branch of knowledge are also 

 due to the gentlemen whose names are mentioned above. 



Chiefly upon this collection, thus increased in the number and ethnical 

 variety of its specimens, are based the following observations, which, in their 

 general scope and tendency, may be regarded as a continuation of the leading 

 inquiry started in my paper on the Jerusalem skull, which was published in 

 the Proceedings of the Academy for September, 1859. 



That inquiry, it may be remembered, was to ascertain whether from the 

 form of the entire skull, or of some characteristic part of it, the race as well 

 as the type to which any particular cranium belonged, could be definitely 

 determined. As the basis of this .inquiry, a fragmentary head was selected, 

 having a very peculiar occipital conformation, but whose ethnical origin was 

 wholly unknown. This cranium was subjected to a severe critical analysis 

 and comparison with other heads in the collection. In the course of this 

 comparison, whose leading results have already been communicated to the 

 Academy, the following observations were made, and are now brought forward 

 as. another contribution to the sum of recorded human knowledge, and an 

 additional step towards the emancipation of Ethnology from the dogmatism 

 and conjectural assertion with which a host of pseudo-scientific writers have 

 so industriously surrounded it, in their ill-advised attempts to solve definitely 

 certain great questions concerning the origin and primitive affiliations of the 

 races of men. 



In the \evy front rank of ethnological inquiry stands Craniography. As 

 the epitome, not of the skeleton merely, but also of the entire physical man, 

 the cranium, by some of the best observers and profoundest thinkers of 

 modern times, lias justly been regarded as capable of furnishing valuable 

 information concerning the zoological relations of the different races of men. 

 This conviction animates the " Cephalogenesis " of Spix, the "Decades 

 Craniorum " of Blumenbach, the numerous and important craniological 

 papers of Retzius, the " Tabulse Craniorum" of Sandifort, the "Crania 

 Americana" and "Crania iEgyptiaca " of Morton, the " Atlas der Cranio- 

 scopie " of Cams, the "Crania Britannica " of Davis and Thurnam, the 

 " Organischen Formenlehre " of Lucre, the " Schsedel, Hirn und Seele des 

 Menschen und der Thiere " of Huschke, the "Crania Selecta " of K. E. Von 

 Baer, and most recently of all the " Catalogus Craniorum Diversarum 

 Gentium " of Prof. J. Van der Hoeven, of Leyden, well known as an able 

 observer and a zealous cultivator of the natural history of man. 



It must be confessed, however, that owing to the limited number of speci- 

 mens in the various cranial collections, and the genealogical uncertainty 

 whk-h surrounds many of those which have been figured and described by 

 different observers, craniography can, as yet, boast of but few established 

 principles. The cranial descriptions published by Blumenbach and many of 

 his successors are entirely too brief and vague for the purposes of that exact 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 399 



and minute comparison, which alone can lead to any really important results. 

 Before the deeply interesting and complicated questions of ethnology can 

 receive much light from craniography, the latter must furnish extensive com- 

 parisons of the heads of different races of men, not in respect to their general 

 form only, but with reference to the exact conformation and minute anatomical 

 peculiarities of each of the several natural regions of the skull the crown, 

 base, occiput, facial and lateral aspects. Convinced of the truthfulness of 

 this statement, I have attempted, in the following pages, a comparison of the 

 heads in the Morton collection, with reference to their occipital peculiarities 

 only, hoping, at some future time, as leisure permits, to institute, in like 

 manner, a comparison of these heads with regard to their coronal, basal, 

 facial and lateral characters successively. 



A peculiar flattening of the Tipper or parietal portion of the occipital re- 

 gion characterizes the heads of Norwegians (1260),* Swedish peasants (117, 

 1247, 1249, 1258, 1486 to 14S8), Finland, Sodermannland, Turannic and 

 Cimbric Swedes (1545 to 1549, 121, 1532, 1550, 1362), Ostrogoths (1255), 

 and Swedish Finns (1542 to 1544). From about the middle of the sagittal 

 suture the parietal bones slope or shelve away posteriorly, so as to form an 

 inclined plane, which modifies or interrupts the regular ovoidal form of the 

 head, and terminates, in most instances, at the lambdoidal suture, or a little 

 below it, on the superior portion of the os occipitis.f The occipital protuber- 

 ance in all these crania is very well marked ; and in some, apparently ex- 

 aggerated by the peculiarity above mentioned. In the two ' ' ancient Cimbric ' ' 

 skulls (1532, 1550), in a very old Cimbrian head (1362), from the Danish 

 island of Moen, in the Baltic, and in the crania of an Ostrogoth (1255), and 

 a Swedish woman of the 13th century (1249), the knob-like protuberance of 

 the occiput gives to the calvaria a peculiarly elongated and kumbe-kephalic 

 or boat-shaped form. This occipital prominence is also seen in a fragmentary 

 Burgundian head (1533), from a tomb near Lausanne, in Switzerland, but is 

 not so well marked. 



From the investigations of Prof. Nilsson, it would appear that the aborigines 

 of Scandinavia, had "short heads, with broad and flattened occiputs," 

 features exhibited by other ancient people, such as the Lapps and Samoiedes, 

 the Iberians or Basques of the Pyrenees, and the mysterious Pelasgi, whose 

 traces are still found in Greece. The short-headed race of Scandinavia appears 

 to have been followed by another race of men, whose skulls were charac- 

 terized by prominent and narrow occiputs. J The hind-head of a large 

 Danish cranium, figured by Nilsson, after Eschricht, of Copenhagen, is full 

 and rounded. 



In the skulls of "true Finns" (1534 to 1541, 1252, 1259), the occiput 

 is neither prominent nor depressed, but flatly round, and in keeping, there- 

 fore, with the general globularity of the head. The Finnic cranial type 

 appears to be preserved in its greatest purity among the primitive inhabitants 

 of Esthonia. Dr. Hueck, in describing the head of an Esthonian, says, that 



*The numbers inclosed in brackets are those by which the skulls are designated in 

 my Catalogue of Human Crania in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia. 



tThis conformation also pertains to the Greenland, Scandinavian and Cretin skulls, 

 figured in Tables 3, 4 and 6, of Carus' Atlas cler Cranioscopie, Heft 1. I find it also more 

 or less strongly pronounced in the crania represented in Tables 3, 4, 8 and 9, (Sch'ddeln 

 abnormer Form), and 1, 3, 6, 9, 10 and 11, {Sch&deln lehannter Personen) of the Archi- 

 i tur des Menschenschadtls, of Dr. Lues.

the occiput, in the region of the superior linea semicircularis, is strongly 

 arched, both posteriorly and towards the sides.* 



The well-characterized Norwegian and Swedish skulls in the Museum of 

 the Academy have the basal portion of the occipital region quite flat, and 

 parallel with the horizon, when the head rests squarely upon the lower jaw. 

 The lower part of the occiput in the German heads is more prominent than 

 in the Finns, less than in the Swedes, and still less than in the Cimbri ; 

 while the upper part is less flat than in the Swedes. The occipital region of 

 the German skull, in point of conformation, occupies a place intermediate 

 between that of the Swedes and Finns. 



In the skull of a Dutchman (434), born in Utrecht, the posterior or occi- 

 pital region is flat and broad, and presents to the eye a somewhat pentagonal 

 outline. 



The Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-American crania, though, like the Swedes, 

 longer than the Germanic and Finnic skulls, have nearly the same rounded 

 occiput as these latter. The parietalia of an Anglo-Saxon skull, figured in 

 the first Decade of Crania Britannica, incline downwards and backwards 

 towards the occiput, as in the Norwegian cast referred to above. The occi- 

 pital bone is full and rounded, and has a considerable projection posteriorly. 



Most of the skulls in the collection, marked "Celtic Irish," exhibit the 

 same downward and backward inclination of the upper or parietal portion of 

 the occipital region as described above. The occiput of No. 18 has the same 

 boat-like shape as that of the Ostrogoth (1255) and the Cimbri (1532, &c). 

 The occipital region of No. 42 differs from that of the preceding in being a 

 little fuller. The same shelving of the upper occipital region is also present 

 in Nos. 52 and 1186. It is also exhibited, though less markedly, in No. 

 1356, and still less in No. 985 ; while in No. 986, the occipital type approxi- 

 mates the Swedish form, being rounder, fuller, less inclined, and having the 

 protuberance not so prominent. In several respects these skulls correspond 

 with those found in the cromlechs or sepulchral mounds of Ireland, and 

 described by Mr. Wilde as possessing the projecting occiput, which charac- 

 terizes the dolicho-kephalic crania, found in ancient Danish tumuli. It would 

 thus seem that the earliest inhabitants of Ireland, like those of Scandinavia, 

 had short heads and flattened occiputs, while the people who succeeded 

 them were remarkable for long, oval heads and prominent occiputs. Wilson 

 and Bateman, on the contrary, have concluded, from their investigations, that 

 the primitive people of Scotland and England possessed long, kumbe-kephalic 

 or boat-shaped heads, peculiarly characterized by a narrow prolongation of 

 the occiput in the region of the cerebellum. Prof. D. Wilson is inclined to 

 regard this peculiar form of the hind-head as diagnostic of the primitive 

 Caledonians. I find it equally well pronounced, however, in two Egyptian 

 skulls (Nos. 837, 838), from the Pyramid of Five Steps, at Saccara. 



In an ancient Briton, of the brachy-kephalic type, figured in Crania 

 Britannica, the "occipital bone is somewhat full above the protuberance, 

 which, itself, is strongly marked. " In another ancient Briton, belonging to the 

 dolicho-kephalic class, and represented and described in the same work, the 

 occiput is full, prominent and rounded, and presents a strongly-marked 

 transverse ridge. 



Three oblong skulls from the catacombs of Paris (661, 662 and 663), have 

 the occiput flattened almost vertically. In No. 663, the upper part of the os 

 occipitis presents a lozenge-shaped prominence, which, though flattened itself, 

 somewhat destroys or interrupts the general perpendicularity of the back part 

 of the head. No. 664, also from the catacombs, is a brachy-kephalic head, with 

 a markedly perpendicular and wall-like flatness of the occiput. This head, I 

 am inclined to think, is that of a Basque or Iberian of the Pyrenees. 



There are no Spanish skulls in the Academy's collection. The private

collection of Prof. Van der Hoeven contains several from Grenada, Catalonia, 

 &c. Of one of these, No. 31, he writes in his catalogue,* "Occipitis pars 

 superior gibba, '' and of another, No. 32, " os occipitis supra gibbum." In 

 describing a Lusitanian skull, he says, "Occiput gibbum ; linese semicircu- 

 lares et protuberantia occipitalis vix distincta. " 



In the asymmetrical Sclavonian skull from Olmutz in Moravia (1251), and in 

 No. 1253, a Sclave from Morlack in Dalmatia, the occiput is flatly globular or 

 truncated. If classified according to its form, No. 1251 might be placed between 

 the Turkish and Kalmuck types. 



In a Polish skull in Prof. Van der Hoeven's collection, the occipital region 

 is prominent at the apex of the lambdoidal suture. The occiput of another 

 Poland skull is broad and gibbous in the upper portion. 



In the Turkish skull figured by Blumeubach (table 2) the external 

 occipital protuberance is but little developed, so that there seems to be no 

 occiput. Two Turkish skulls obtained from a burial ground at Scutari, and 

 described by Dr. Williamson,! have a rounded occiput. 



In a Cossack skull (133) from Balaklava, the occiput is broad and very 

 flat. 



In the Hungarian cranium, according to Edwards, J the back of the head ap- 

 pears flat, forming almost a straight line with the nape of the neck. 



A cast of the skull of a young Greek (1354), exhibits a moderately full and 

 rounded occiput. In the Greek skulls, in the Chatham collection, the " occiput 

 is well rounded, and does not, in general, project ; the space for the downward 

 projection of the brain in the occipital region is well developed." 



The cranium of a Roman praetorian soldier, figured by Blumenbach, has the 

 external occipital protuberance very broad and prominent. In the skull of a 

 Roman soldier, || taken from an ancient cemetery at York, the occiput is broad 

 and rounded, and the protuberance rather prominent. So also in the Roman 

 cranium described by Dr. Thurnam,^ the occipital bone is full and prominent, 

 especially in its upper half. 



In an Etruscan skull in the Galerie Anthropologique at Paris, the occiput is 

 full and rounded.** 



The general form of the occipital region of the so-called Phoenician skull 

 (1352) is like that of the Norwegian. In the latter, however, the external 

 occipital protuberance, and the superior curved line are strongly pronounced ; 

 in the former the skull is quite smooth at this place. 



All the Circassian skulls exhibit great fulness of the occipital protuberance. 

 The upper part of the hind-head is flat. The occiput as a whole is rounded in 

 the Armenian skull, No. 789, and in this respect is like the Persian skull, No. 

 731. Nos. 790, 791, 792 (Armenian) are longer and more angular heads, and 

 owing to the prominence of the occipital protuberance, are more like the Cir- 

 cassian skulls. In Nos. 792 and 794, also Armenian, the occiput is flatly 

 round. The rather short and angular Parsee heads, exhibit a rounded occi- 

 put very well shown in No. 731, but less marked in No. 743, owing to the 

 general prominence of the occipital bone. The form of the occipital region in 

 the Affghan head, is like that of the Armenian and Circassian. 



The Baluchi and Affghan heads in the Chatham collection have the "occiput

well rounded, and the space for the downward development of the brain con- 

 siderable." The occiput of a Candahar skull is " broad, flat and perpendicular, 

 giving the skull something of the appearance of the flat-headed American In- 

 dians, although in a much less degree." 



The Aflghan head, as a whole, resembles, in several respects, the Hindoo 

 type. 



The ancient Assyrian skull is full and rounded in the occipital region. 



The Egyptian skulls differ among themselves as regards the form of the oc - 

 ciput. Of the series termed " Grseco-Egyptians" by Dr. Morton, Nos. 799, 801, 

 804, 812, 815, 821, 824, 856, 837, 838, 840 and 875, possess, in general, the 

 same occipital form as is seen in the Swedish crania referred to above. Nos. 

 798, 808, 814, 817, 825, 850, 859, 868, 873, 884 and 893 have the occiput less 

 ovoidal in shape and more rounded, owing to the external occipital protuber- 

 ance being less prominent. These latter skulls are, in general, broader than 

 the former, and exhibit a somewhat different configuration of the crown. 

 The same difference is observable in the other groups of skulls representing 

 the Egyptian race in the Academy's collection. Thus of the Ancient Theban 

 Egyptians, Nos. 48, 60, 844, 846, 855, 862, 876, 1044, 1293 and 1295 exhibit 

 a more or less rounded occiput, while in Nos. 847, 848, 849, 851, 853, 854, 

 860, S66, 867, 871, 880, 881, 882, 883, 887, 889, 894 and 1290, the occiput is 

 either shelving, as in the Swedish skull, or elongated, owing to the great pro- 

 tuberance of the occipital boss, as in the kumbe-kephalic crania above alluded 

 to. According to Dr. Morton, No. 1044 may serve as a type of the genuine 

 Egyptian conformation. He describes it as a long, oval cranium with a reced- 

 ing forehead, gently aquiline nose, retracted chin, and a marked distance 

 between the nose and mouth features all characteristic of the monumental 

 Egyptian. He makes no allusion, however, to the configuration of the occiput, 

 which, as will be seen by referring to the wood cut on p. 17 of " Crania iEgyp- 

 tiaca, " or p. 38 of my Catalogue, is quite peculiar. Some idea of the variety of 

 occipital forms among these Egyptian skulls, may be obtained by comparing 

 together the wood cuts in my Catalogue representing Nos. 812, 878, 1044, 88S 

 and 877 of the collection. Dr. Morton's descriptions of the Egyptian skulls 

 are, in general, very brief. He seldom alludes to the shape of the occiput. 

 He notices the "tumid" occiput of No. 871, and the "full" occiput of No. 867. 

 The occipital region of Nog. 861 and 886 is intermediate in shape between the 

 elongate and rounded forms. Of the ancient Egyptians from the Necropolis 

 of Memphis, Nos. 1223, 1235, 1519, 1520, 1521 and 1522 possess a rounded occi- 

 put. In all the rest the posterior part of the head is elongated and flattened 

 superorly. This elongation is particularly well marked in Nos. 809, 810, 811, 

 813, 1201, 1291, and also in No. 819 from Arabat el-Matfoon, the ancient 

 Abydos. In all these skulls the external occipital protuberance is exceedingly 

 prominent. This statement applies also to three embalmed Egyptian heads 

 found by Mr. Win. A. Gliddon in a rock-tomb located about four miles west 

 of the city of Alexandria, and belonging, probably, to the Ptolemaic era. 

 Among the Memphite Egyptian skulls is one (No. 806) which is altogether 

 peculiar and unlike the other heads of this series. It has a broad, low and 

 flat occiput, while the coronal region is decidedly Gothic in its outline. All 

 the crania obtained from the tombs opened by Prof. Lepsius at the base of the 

 great Pyramid of Gizeh, are long, oval heads, with protuberant occiputs, 

 flattened superiorly. Three Kens or ancient Nubians from the pits at Debod, 

 (827, 828, 829) exhibit the protuberant, shelving form of occiput. The hind 

 head in No. 828 is exceedingly elongated. Dr. Morton speaks of the very full 

 occiput of this skull. He makes no allusion to the occipital form in his 

 descriptions of the others. The occiput of No. 826 is rounded. Two crania 

 (830, 831) of ancient Egyptians, from the pits at Koum Ombos, have a rounded 

 occiput. A third, No. 832, has the occiput superiorly flattened. The Acade- 

 my's collection contains four skulls of ancient Egyptians, obtained by the late 

 Mr. G. R. Gliddon from the crocodile mummy-pits called Margaret-es-Sa- 



[Sept.

moun, behind the village of Maabdeh, and opposite to Manfaloot. Three of 

 these,- Nos. 834, 836 and 1292, have the shelving occiput ; in the fourth, No. 

 833, the occiput is rounded. Among the Egyptian skulls grouped in the 

 Catalogue under the head of Miscellaneous, there is one (No. 822) which differs 

 considerably in its general form and characters from the skulls with which it 

 is associated. It was obtained by the late Mr. Gliddon from a tumulus at the 

 Island of Beggeh, the ancient Senem, a sacred spot close to Philas in Nubia. 

 Mr. Gliddon seems to have regarded this skull as that of " a pilgrim to the 

 Temple." The configuration of the crown is triangular, while the occiput is 

 almost vertically flattened. Of the four other heads in this group, Nos. 802 

 and 1240 possess the rounded form of occiput, while in Nos. 803 and 1317 the 

 hind-head is superiorly flattened. 



The dolicho-kephalic Hebrew skulls in the collection, exhibit an occiput 

 more or less regularly rounded, as is very well seen in Nos. 818, 842, 845, 

 865 and 870. In the oblong and somewhat angular head, No. 807, the basal 

 portion of the occiput is perceptibly flattened, and the occipital protuberance 

 somewhat more prominent than in the other skulls of this group. 



In the Arab skulls the occiput is broad and flattened. In No. 781 the occipi- 

 tal region is flattened superiorly, as in the Norwegian and Swedish crania, and 

 the occipital protuberance quite prominent. In No. 784 the head widens out 

 behind the mastoid processes, giving the occipital region a full and rounded 

 appearance. In No. 780 the occiput is flattened. 



The Fellah skulls have very prominent occiputs, the occipital protuberance 

 being more or less strongly marked. The Coptic skull exhibits great breadth 

 and fulness of the whole posterior region. 



The occiput of the cast of an Abyssinian skull in the collection (1361) is 

 quite prominent ; the hind-head shelves downwards and backwards somewhat 

 like that of the Swede. 



The occipital region of the Guanche cranium (23) is full and prominent. 

 The Hindoo skulls in the collection, also vary in the form of the occipital 

 region. Some of the Ayra, Brahminic or high caste heads of this group, such 

 as Nos. 1329, 1331 and 1335 exhibit the Swedish form of occiput ; others (Nos. 

 1330, 1384) the rounded shape. In four Thugs, the occipital configuration is 

 intermediate between these two forms. In No. 1332 the occiput is almost 

 vertically flattened. In 11 Bengalee crania, (Nos. 6, 25, 31, 81, 411, 413, 432, 

 443, 444', 948 and 1312) the occiput is flatly round. In 21 others (Nos. 4, 5, 

 8, 19, 20, 28, 32, 49, 51, 111, 410, 442, 547, 553, 554, 665, 1309, 1310, 1311, 

 1344 and 1554) posterior part of the head is superiorly flattened and inclined. 

 In No. 20 the whole os occipitis stands out very prominently, and is separated 

 from the ossaparietalia by numerous wormian bones. This feature is also seen, 

 to some extent, in Nos. 1309 and 1310. Such a form of the occiput is very well 

 exhibited in plate 20, fig. 1, of the Atlas to Vimont's Traiti de Phrenologie 

 Humaine et Comparee. In No. 29, a peculiar and asymmetrical skull, the 

 occipital bone appears as if pressed from behind and beneath forwards and 

 upwards. The hind-head of No. 1047 is almost vertically flattened. 



In certain crania from the Indian Peninsula, Dr. Williamson says that the 

 posterior part of the skull is large, and the occiput prominent ; the space for 

 the downward developement of the brain of moderate extent. Two Hindoos 

 and a Thug have the occiput prominent. In five crania from Ceylon, the 

 occiput is well rounded. 



There are thirteen Chinese skulls in the Academy's collection. Of these, 

 Nos. 94, 550, 669, 670, 1526, and 1527 exhibit the elongate, shelving form of 

 occiput, very well represented in the wood-cut on p. 47 of my Catalogue of 

 Human Crania. In Nos. 3, 56, 426, 427, and 1028, the occiput is rounded, 

 and in No. 1336 vertically flattened. The Chinese crania in the Chatham 

 Museum have the occiput rounded and not prominent. According to Blan- 

 chard, in the Chinese skulls figured in Dumoutier's Atlas, "la region occipi-

tale s'ctend pen en arriere." Blanchard informs us that this character is ex- 

 hibited in many of the specimens of this race, contained in the anthropo- 

 logical collection of the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris. In all these 

 specimens he found the posterior part of the head a little less elongated than 

 in the inhabitants of the Phillipine Islands.* 



In a Japanese skull (668) the hind-head is rounded; in two Loo-choo crania 

 (672, 673) it is shelving. ' 4 



In two Burmese crania, (661, 667) the occiput is round and moderately full. 

 The occipital region of a Siamese skull, from Bangkok (123) is broad and flat, 

 and slightly resembles that of the Malay head. 



Some of the Malar crania, (41, 1186, 1316, and 1525,) have elongate or 

 shelving occiputs; in others, (46, 47, 201, 433, 543, 1338,- 1339, 1341, 1523,) 

 the occipital region is more or less flatly round ; and in others still, (424, 

 425, 428, 429, 430, 459, 49-5, 544, 546, and 1337,) it is more or less globular. 

 In Nos. 545 and 1340, the occiput is compressed behind, and somewhat be- 

 neath, so as to form a sort of inclined plane, sloping downwards and forwards, 

 to the foramen magnum. 



Nine Burmese and Malay crania in the Chatham collection have the occiput 

 broad and well rounded ; and the space for the downward development of the 

 cerebellum in the occipital region extensive. In one Burmese skull, the pos- 

 terior part of the head is large, and the occiput straight. In a Japanese 

 skull the occiput is broad, fiat, and almost perpendicular. This is true also, 

 of some of the Malay skulls, and of two Burmese described by Dr. Williamson, 

 in the appendix to his catalogue. 



Finlayson, in describing the tribes of the Trans-Gangetic, or Indo-Chinese 

 Peninsula, says that "the occipital foramen is often placed so far back that 

 from the crown to the nape of the neck is nearly a straight line."t According 

 to Dr. Ruschenberger, the occipital portion of the Siamese skull is nearly 

 vertical, and compared with the anterior and sincipital division, very small. t 

 In the inhabitants of Cochin-China or Annam, according to Morton, the 

 occipital portion of the head is more elongated than in the Siamese. 



Only one (1551) of the Lapland skulls in the Academy's collection has the 

 shelving occiput ; all the others, (1250, 1257, and 1552,) possess a broad and 

 flatly rounded occipital region. 



All the Eskimo crania in the collection have narrow, elongate, or ovoidal 

 occiputs. In an Eskimo skull at Chatham, the "occiput is narrow and 

 prominent." 



In the Tchuktchi crania brought from Behring's Straits by my friend, E. M. 

 Kern, Esq., the occiput is prominent and shelving. The skull of an Aleutian, 

 from Unalaschka, contained in the Rijk's Museum of Natural History, at 

 Leyden, and figured and described by Prof. Van der Heaven, has a prominent 

 ociput. 



The occipital region of a Kamskatkan cranial cast (725) is full and pro- 

 tuberant. In the skull of a Northern Reindeer Tungus, figured by Blumen- 

 bach, in Table xvi. of his Decades Craniorum, "the occiput is remarkably 

 prominent, so that the distance between the external occipital protuberance 

 and the superior incisors is equal to nine inches." The Kalmuck (1553) and 

 Burat skulls (1355) have globular occiputs. 



The occipital region of the skull of an Icelander (125) is full, protuberant, 

 and shelving.

Four of the Kanaka skulls in the collection, (564, 695, 1300, and 1308,) 

 have elongate or shelving occiputs. In three others, (566, 572,) the occiput 

 is rounded. In two skulls from Oahu, (1023, 1024,) the occipital region is 

 prominent ; in another (1022) it is more rounded. Three Tahaitian crania 

 (1017, 1019, 1020,) exhibit protuberant and shelving occiputs. In two other 

 Tahaitian heads (1016, 1021) the occiput is more rounded, and in still 

 another (1018) it is broad and flat. The crania of Sandwich Islanders, in the 

 Chatham collection, possess rounded occiputs. In an Otahaitian skull the 

 occiput is prominent. 



There are three Marquesan skulls in the Academy's collection. In one of 

 these, from Nukahivah, the occiput is narrow and shelving, and the occipital 

 boss quite protuberant. In another, also, from Nukahivah, and a third from 

 Christina, the occipital region is fuller and less prominent. 



All the New Zealand crania in the Academy's collection exhibit the elongate 

 and narrow form of occiput. In five New Zealand skulls in the Chatham 

 Museum, " the occiput is not prominent, but well rounded off." 



In a Feejee specimen from Bau, (1029) the occipital region is narrow and 

 protuberant.* 



Three Arickaree skulls, of the Upper Missouri, exhibit the same shelving 

 occiput and prominent occipital protuberance, seen in the Swedish, Cimbrian, 

 and Ostrogoth crania. They are long, oval skulls, and resemble, in their 

 general configuration, the Swedish crania, as may be seen by comparing 

 together No. 649 (Arickaree), and No. 1247 (Swede). One of the Arickaree 

 skulls (No. 748), presents a somewhat modified occipital form. It is like that 

 represented in plate 35 of Crania Americana, or fig. 2 of plate 96 of Vimont's 

 Atlas. The superiorly flattened form of the occiput is also seen in the 

 Assinaboin skulls, though less strongly marked. These crania are broader 

 and less oval than the preceding. The same occipital form is also very well 

 marked in Nos. 632 and 635 of the Cherokee group. These two crania are 

 long ovals. In the other specimens of this group, the occipital protuberance 

 is less prominent, and the whole hind-head more evenly rounded in the line 

 of prolongation of the sagittal suture. These Cherokee skulls differ from each 

 other in several particulars. In two Chetimache skulls, from Louisiana, the 

 occipital region is flattened nearly perpendicularly from the superior spinous 

 ridge upwards. In the Chippeway or Ojibway skull, No. 684, the hind-head 

 is shelving ; in No. 683 it presents a different form, as seen in plate 28 of 

 Crania Americana. Two of the"Kootenay crania (Nos. 744, 745), have the 

 occiput protuberant and elongated. In No. 1227 the hind-head is flat. Two 

 of the Creek skulls (Nos. 441, 579), are short heads with broad, globular 

 occiputs. No. 751, a long, oval skull, has the superiorly flattened hind-head 

 and prominent occipital protuberance well marked. In its general form, this 

 head strongly calls to mind the Cimbric type or configuration. In No. 1454 

 the occiput is rounded. Dr. Morton, writing in 1839, says that " the present 

 Creek nation is said to embrace the remains of no less than fifteen different 

 tribes, which they have conquered at various times." This fact may explain 

 the discrepancy in forms exhibited by the different specimens of this group. 

 The Dacota skull (No. 605) has a globular occiput. In No. 112, the occipital 

 region is very much elongated and shelving, as in the Creek skull (No. 751). 

 The occiput of No. 204, resembles that of the Cayuga skull, figured in plate 35 

 of Crania Americana. The Huron cranium (No. 15) is beautifully lithographed 

 in Crania Americana, pi. 37. Reference to it will show that the occiput is so 

 flattened as to slant or incline from above downwards and backwards, and to

occupy a position between the shelving occiput of the Swede and the verti- 

 cally flattened form. Nos. 1217 and 1218 exhibit the same form. No. 607 

 approximates the shelving, or superiorly flattened sbape. Tlie exact form oi 

 the hind-head cannot be determined in the Illinois crania in the Academy's 

 collection, for the whole of the os occipitis is wanting in No. 1010, and the 

 greater part in No. 1051. In the former, the occiput appears to have been 

 shelving ; in the latter, flatly round or globular. In two Iroquois skulls (Nos. 

 16 and 119), the occiput is elongated and shelving. In a third (No. 989), it 

 is almost globular. Of the Lenape, or Delaware Indian skulls, Nos. 40, 115. 

 118, and 1265, possess an elongated occiput, such as is seen in plate 32 ot 

 Crania Americana. In No. 418 the posterior region is rounded, and far less 

 prominent. In Nos. 1263, 1562, and 1563, the hind-head is broad and squarely 

 flattened. In No. 1264 the occipital protuberance is prominent and knob- 

 like. No. 998 is flatly round in the occipital region. In all the Mandan 

 and Minetari skulls, the form of the occipital region is very similar to that of 

 the Arickarees and Assinaboins. The form of the occiput varies among the 

 different specimens of the Menominee group. Nos. 35, 44, 78, 454, and 563. 

 exhibit the form seen in the Huron skull, figured in Crania Americana, plate 

 37. The other two (Nos. 1220 and and 1222), are more elongated behind. 

 No. 10-58 of the Miami group, has an occiput like the Huron cranium just 

 alluded to. In 1233 the hind-head is perpendicularly flattened. All the rest 

 of this series exhibit the elongated form. In the three Mohawk crania, the 

 occiput is superiorly flattened, and the occipital protuberance prominent. 

 Two Moqui skulls (138, 139), are brachykephalic, with very flat occiputs. 

 The Narragansett skulls in the collection differ from each other in the form oi 

 the occipital region. In No. 950 the hind-head is elongated. In No. 951 

 it is shelving, all that part of the occipital bone above the superior spinous 

 ridge being tumid. The posterior part of the head, in Nos. 952 and 954, 

 shelves or inclines from above downwards and backwards. In the latter skull 

 the occipital base is very protuberant. In No. 953 the occiput is full and 

 rounded, instead of being elongated, as in the others. This is true, also, of 

 Nos. 956 and 693. In the latter, the os occipitis is somewhat pressed forwards 

 under the parietalia. No. 1040 is a very peculiar, oblong head ; the shelving 

 and elongated occiput projects far behind the external auditory meati, and 

 the basis-occipitis is quite flat. Nos. 955 and 957 have pointed or acuminated 

 occiputs, which appear to be posthumously distorted. In No. 955 the left 

 side of the occipital bone is flattened ; in No. 957, the right. In the former 

 the left side, and in the latter the right, appears to have rested upon the 

 ground for a very long time, and to have been flattened by the weight of the 

 superincumbent bones of the head. This flatness gives an acuminated ap- 

 pearance to the occiput, the point being to one or other side of the median 

 line. Since the publication of Crania Americana, craniographers have been 

 familiar with the vertical flatness of the occiput in crania of the Natchez tribe. 

 This peculiar flatness is well shown in No. 1106. The shelving occipital form 

 is shown in all the Natick skulls. Of the Osage crania, No. 54 is a short, 

 angularly round head, with an occiput almost vertically flattened. In No. 

 660, a larger head, the tumid occiput gives a shelving form to the hind-head, 

 seen in profile. In the Ottoes the occiput is broad and flatly round, and ap- 

 proximates strongly, the globular form exhibited in the Lapps and Kalmucks." 

 The same form is exhibited in the round-headed Ottawa, No. 1007. In the 

 other two Ottawa skulls, the hind-head is shelving. In the round-headed 

 Ottigamies, the occiput is globular. In No. 415 of this group, this globular 

 shape is destroyed by the tumid occiput. The two Pawnee skulls contrast 

 strongly with each other in the shape of the occiput, which in No. 540 is flatly 

 round, and in No. 1043 is excessively elongated and shelving. In two 

 Penobscot skulls the occiput is rounded. Of the Potawatomie crania, No. 

 657, as shown in plate 34 of Crania Americana, has an angularly round 



[Sept.

occiput. In No. 736, a short, triangular skull ; the occiput is flat. In the 

 broadly oval cranium (No. 737), the hind-head is rounded. In No. 1352 the 

 hind-head approximates the shelving type. The two Sauk skulls are unlike 

 each other in the shape of the occiput. No. 561 has a broad, though pro- 

 tuberant hind-head. In No. 1246 the occipital region is rounded. The Semi- 

 nole Indians are represented in the Academy's collection by sixteen skulls. 

 No. 456 (figured in Crania Americana, pi. 241, is a round head, with a full 

 and somewhat angularly rounded occiput. In No. 604 the knob-like pro- 

 tuberance of the occipital bone destroys the rounded form of the hind-head, 

 and gives the latter a different shape, as will be seen by comparing the first 

 cut on page 166 of Crania Americana, with plate 24 of that work. In No. 

 698 the hind-head is elongated and shelving. In No. 707 it approximates in 

 its lower part the globular form, and is in striking contrast with No. 456, as 

 may be seen by comparing together plates 23 and 24 of Crania Americana. 

 In No. 708 it is more elongated and less broad, and in No. 754 rather flatly 

 rounded. No. 726 is a short head, with a full, broad, but somewhat shelving 

 occiput. No. 727 possesses a narrow and prominent occiput, which is wider 

 between the parietal bosses than at the base. In No. 728 the occiput is fuller 

 and more rounded. In No. 729 the hind head is rather narrow below, and 

 protuberant. In No. 730 the occiput is broader at the base than above, and 

 quite pointed. In Nos. 732, 733, 753,* and 1286, the occiput is protuberant 

 and shelving above. A Shawnee skull, "No. 606, has a very narrow, pro- 

 tuberant, and symmetrical occiput ; the left, basal part of the occipital bone 

 being flattened, perhaps posthumously. In No. 691 the occiput is flattened 

 vertically on the right side. In No. 1210, a narrow, and highly arched skull, 

 the hind head is narrow, and the upper part of the occipital bone prominent. 

 The Shoshone skulls in the collection are not alike in the form of the occiput. 

 No. 1446 exhibits a broad and somewhat flatly rounded hind-head, appearing 

 as if pressed under the parietal bosses ; the upper and posterior part of the 

 head, just between the parietal protuberances, being broad and very elevated. 

 In No. 1447 the occiput is protuberant and shelving. In No. 1448 the occiput 

 is broad at the base, and flattened, though not vertically. No. 1449 possesses a 

 rounded and not very prominent occiput. Two Upsarooka skulls, (Nos. 

 1228 and 1229), have the hind-head shelving, and the occipital base very 

 prominent. In the Winnebago cranium (No. 559), the occiput is broad and 

 globular. In No. 560 it is less broad and more projecting. In the Yamasse 

 skulls (Nos. 1214 and 1215), the occiput is narrow and rounded. In No. 

 1216 it is broad and rounded, almost to globularity. There are four skulls of 

 California Indians in the collection, f No. 1514 exhibits what may be called 

 a pyramidal occiput. The occipital bone above the superior spinous ridge is 

 very prominent, and constitutes a common centre, towards which the parietals 

 slant from above downwards and backwards, and also at the sides, and the basal 

 portion of the occipital bone upwards and backwards, somewhat after the 

 fashion seen in some of the elongated Peruvian heads. No. 1027, a female 

 cranium from Mare Island, California, is a long, narrow head, with a narrow 

 and oval occiput. No. 943, also from Mare Island, exhibits a shelving occiput. 

 Of the crania marked "miscellaneous" in the Catalogue, No. 416, from a 

 mound on the Upper Mississippi, possesses a narrow and prominent occiput. 

 This skull is represented in plate 52 of Crania Americana in such a position 

 that, at first sight, the occiput appears full and rounded. But if the observer 

 will place his hand, over the lower jaw, so as to hide it, and then hold the 

 lithograph in such a manner that the base of the skull shall be parallel with 



* The last skull of the Seminole group should be numbered in the Catalogue, 753, in- 

 stead of 1556. 



t Two of these are enumerated in the published Catalogue. The other two have been 

 added to the collection by my friend, Dr. Thos. J. Turner, of the United States Navy, 

 since the Catalogue was printed.

the plane of the horizon, he will then see that the head is in reality a long 

 one, and that the occipital region is prominent and not round. No. 1237, 

 from Illinois, is a broad, asymmetrical head, flattened behind slantingly, and 

 rather to the left. Nos. 1315, 1510, and 1511 have broad, prominent, and 

 somewhat shelving occiputs. No. 420, from the Cave at Steubenville, Ohio, 

 has a low, broad occiput, flattened on the right side. In No. 436, also from 

 the Cave-cemetery at Steubenville, the broad occiput is almost vertically 

 flattened. In Nos. 437 and 438, also from Steubenville, the occiput is low, 

 broad, and vertically flattened. The former is asymmetrical. The occiput is 

 slantingly flattened in No. 439. No. 210 is wanting in symmetry. The 

 occiput is flattened on the left side, perhaps posthumously. It appears to 

 have been originally moderately full and rounded. In No. 658 the broad occiput 

 is asymmetrically flattened to the right of the median line. No. 723, also 

 non-symmetrical, has a low, broad, and vertically flattened occiput. In No. 

 53, from a mound at Circleville, the occipital protuberance is prominent, and 

 the hind-head shelving. No. 1287, from a mound at Chillicothe, has a broad 

 occiput, slightly truncated or flattened, directly behind. No. 1288, from the

 much like that of the California head (No. 1514). In Nos. 216 and 219, the 

 occiput is shelving and protuberant. The same form is seen in the Maya 

 skull (No. 990). The Araucanian skull (No. 651) has a full and rounded 

 occiput. In No. 652 the occiput is arched. In No. 654 the occipital region is 

 square and truncated, or vertically flattened, as is well shown in plate 68 

 of Crania Americana. In Nos. 655 and 656 the occiput is moderately full and 

 rounded. In No. 995 the hind-head is fuller than in the preceding, and the 

 occipital protuberance more prominent. In No. 997 the occipital boss is very 

 prominent. In No. 221 the hind-head is shelving, and the occipital protuberance 

 sharply pointed. In No. 222 the occiput is shelving and protuberant; in 

 No. 120 it is broad and flatly round. The flattened form of the occiput of No. 

 1242 is well shown in the wood-cut on p. 75 of the Catalogue. The three Charib 

 skulls in the collection have prominent and elongated occiputs. In the cast of 

 a Patagonian skull, the hind-head projects far behind the meati. The whole 

 of the occipital region is full and tumid. In many of the crania which we have 

 passed in review, the elongation of the occiput backwards is chiefly due to the 

 great prominence of the occipital boss. In the Patagonian head, this feature 

 is not present. The-hind head of the Puelche girl is rather flat. The head 

 of a Puelche, from the Rio Negro, figured by d'Orbigny, has a truncated

occiput.* In all the Brazilian crania, the occipital region is more or less 

 elongated and superiorly flattened, as in the Swedes. 



There are nine aboriginal American skulls in the collection at Fort Pitt, 

 Chatham. These are described by Dr. Williamson! in his catalogue. No. 67, 

 from Lake Huron, has a rounded occiput. No. 68, skull of a North American 

 Indian, has the occiput projecting. In No. 69 "the vertex and occiput are 

 well arched." In No. 70 the occiput is rounded. In No. 71 "the vertex and 

 occiput are well rounded." In No. 473, from Canada, the occiput is large 

 and well rounded, and the space for the downward development of the brain 

 in the occipital region is very great. No. 474, also from Canada, is a round 

 skull. No special statement is made concerning the form of the occiput, but 

 from the general description of the head, I consider it to be oval. In No. 475. 

 a Flathead, ' ' the occiput descends from the vertex abruptly, and almost per- 

 pendicularly to the foramen magnum." In No. 476, a Charib, from St. Vin- 

 cent, "the vertex gradually slopes backwards and downwards to the occiput, 

 which projects, and is narrow from above downwards ; the occiput is very flat, 

 and nearly the whole of the occipital bone rests upon a plane surface." 



The late Dr. Morton, as is well known, regarded flatness of the occiput 

 as a characteristic feature of the aboriginal American skull. In Crania 

 Americana (page 65), he expressly says that "flatness of the occipital 

 portion of the cranium will probably be found to characterize the 

 greater or less number of individuals in every existing tribe, from Terra del 

 Fuego to the Canadas. If these skulls be viewed behind, we observe the 

 occipital outline to be moderately curved outwards, wide at the occipital pro- 

 tuberances, and full from those points to the opening of the ear. From the 

 parietal protuberances there is a slightly curved slope to the vertex, pro- 

 ducing a conical, or rather a. wedge-shaped outline." He says, furthermore, 

 that even in the elongated heads of the Lenapes, the Iroquois, Cherokees, 

 Mandans, Rickarees, and Assinaboins, "the characteristic truncation of the 

 occiput is more or less obvious." In another publication^ when alluding to 

 the physical characteristics of the Indian tribes, he again speaks of ' ' the flat- 

 tened or vertical occiput" as a characteristic common to them all. In the 

 3d edition of his Catalogue of Skulls of Man and the Inferior Animals, Dr. M, 

 briefly describes a very remarkable head, found by Dr. Davis and Mr. 

 Squier, in a mound in the Scioto Valley, Ohio, and described and figured by 

 them in their "Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley," plates 47 and 

 48. Dr. M. regarded this head as the "perfect type of the Indian conforma- 

 tion, to which the skulls of all the tribes, from Cape Horn to Canada, more 

 or less approximate. It possesses the national characteristics in perfection, 

 as seen in the elevated vertex, flattened occiput, &c. Similar forms, " he con- 

 tinues, "are common in the Peruvian tombs, and have the occiput as in this 

 instance, so flattened and vertical as to give the idea of artificial compression : 

 yet this is only an exaggeration of the natural form, caused by the pressure of 

 the cradle-board, in common use among the American nations." 



In his last contribution to craniography, Dr. Morton describes the typical 

 Indian skull to be of a decidedly rounded form, with the occipital portion 

 flattened in the upward direction. 



Dr. Morton's opinion concerning the typical form of the occiput in the 

 various tribes of American Indians, though very generally acquiesced in by 

 craniographers, has not been accepted by all without qualification.

la depression de l'occiput etait loin d'etre aussi generate et aussi marquee que 

 parmi les Incas et que chez les cranes examines par Meyen ; car dans plusieurs 

 d'entre eux, la tete est plutot normalement developpee en arriere. Ce qui 

 m'etonne, " he continues, "c'estqu' independamment de la transmission 

 hereditaire, Morton n'ait pas fait jouer un role plus general a Taction pro- 

 longee de ce genre de berceau, le compagnon des peuples nomades sur l'apla- 

 tissement du derriere de la tete, qu'il considere comme un caractere normal 

 du type americain."* 



Dr. J. B. Davis also writes that though "this position of Morton's is no 

 doubt founded in truth, yet it must be allowed to be liable to numerous ex- 

 ceptions." His doubts appear to have been awakened by the fact which he 

 mentions, that the crania of Americans, figured by Sandifort and Milne- 

 Edwards, (one of them given as a typical skull), are both distinguished by a 

 considerable occipital projection.! 



Prof. Daniel Wilson, of Canada, in a recent interesting paper on the 

 Cranial Type of the American Aborigines, J tells us that he has carefully ex- 

 amined twenty-nine Indian skulls, three only of which he regards as brachy- 

 (ephalic. " One of these three, a very remarkable and massive skull, was 

 turned up at Barrie, on Lake Simcoe, with, it is said, upwards of two hundred 

 others. It differs from all the other Indian crania, in exhibiting the vertical 

 occiput so very strikingly, that when laid resting on it, it stands more firmly 

 than in any other position." He thinks there can be little doubt that the 

 flattened occiput of this skull is the result of artificial compression of a much 

 more decided nature than that of the cradle-board of the papoose. 



Further on, he says, " I am struck, in the majority of the examples ex- 

 amined, with the total absence of any approximation to the flattened occiput." 

 Fifteen of the crania referred to exhibit a more o.r les.5 decided posterior pro- 

 jection of the occiput, twelve of these being markedly so, and seven of them 

 presenting such a prolongation of it, as constituted one of the most striking 

 features in one class of ancient Scottish crania, which chiefly led to the sug- 

 gestion of the term kumbecephale." * * * " I think it extremely pro- 

 lxable that further investigation will tend to the conclusion that the vertical 

 or flattened occiput, instead of being a typical characteristic, pertains entirely 

 to the class of artificial modifications of the natural cranium familiar to the 

 American ethnologist, alike in the disclosures of ancient graves, and in the 

 ustoms of widely separated living tribes." 



From the details which I have presented above, it will be seen that the 

 opinions upon this subject, entertained by Dr. Morton, cannot be substantiated 

 by the aboriginal American crania in the Academy's collection. The verti- 

 cally flattened occiput is by no means a distinctive character of these crania ; 

 on the contrary, it is only an occasional feature among them, and is exhibited 

 also by the skulls of other, and distant races of men. In fact, the occipital 

 region of our American Indian skulls exhibits quite a variety of forms. In 

 some, as we have already seen, the flatness is located superiorly, affecting 

 equally the posterior superior part of the ossa-parietalia, and the upper part 

 of the os occipitis ; in others, and they are comparatively few, the flattening 

 is directly behind, and is vertical ; in a third variety the flatness is confined 

 wholly to the basal portion of the occipital bone. In some of the skulls the 

 occiput is evenly rounded, in the direction of the longitudinal periphery, the 

 transverse diameter, behind the bony meati, being comparatively small ; in 

 others it is full and globular. If the reader will place the Crania Americana 

 before him, and compare together the outline representations of the posterior 

 part of the skull in the different tribes of Indians, he will be struck with the

htierence of form which they exhibit. In some it is higher than broad ; in 

 others it is broader than high; in others again, the greatest breadth is _ be- 

 tween the parietal bosses ; in a fourth variety the greatest breadth coincides 

 with the base. In some, the contour of the hind head is almost square ; in 

 in some almost circular ; in some oblong ; in others triangular, and in others 

 still, pentagonal or very irregular. Now, none of these forms are diagnostic 

 of the Indian skull. Indeed, they all appertain to the races of the Eastern con- 

 tinent, as well as to those of the Western. 



It is very well known to craniographers that Dr. Morton, as early as 1846, 

 pointed out the existence of at least four different forms of the Peruvian skull, 

 all of which he regarded as artificial deformations, although in his Crania 

 Americana, published long before, he contended that these forms were natural 

 and congenital. Five years later, Dr. Rivero andTschudi, without appearing 

 to be aware of the views of Dr. Morton, arrived at the same conclusion that 

 these peculiar forms were congenital, and that there were four varieties of 

 them. Now, in all these varieties the occiput, as might be expected, varies 

 in form. One variety is very well shown in plate 2 of Crania Americana (No. 

 496 of the Catalogue), and also in the wood-cut representing No. 1277 of the 

 Catalogue. This form of occiput is also seen in Nos. 1275, 1279, 1280, 1281, 

 1283, 1284, 1363, 1364, 1366, and many others. A very different form of the 

 whole head, and of the occiput, which is flatly rounded, is seen in plate 7 of 

 Crania Americana, representing a Peruvian, from Santa. No. 1276 exhibits 

 a similar occiput. In his interesting work entitled Three Years in the Pacific, 

 Dr. Ruschenberger alludes to the peculiarities of form shown in Peruvian 

 skulls. He says that in many of the crania obtained by him at Santa, the 

 occiput "is almost vertical, and rises quite abruptly from the great hole at 

 the base" (p. 374). In plate 4 of Crania Americana, it will be seen that the 

 occiput is much fuller and rounder than in the last specimens. Just such a 

 form of the occipital region is represented in Nos. 1278, 1282, 1365, and 1366. 

 Nos. 13, 30, 75, 77, 84, 85, 86, 87, 93, 95, 97, 446, and many others, are 

 asymmetrical skulls, flattened behind in a manner more or less like one or 

 other of the forms represented in plates 8, 11, and 11 B,of Crania Americana. 

 In other skulls of this great Toltecan group, the occipital flatness is almost 

 vertical, and at the same time symmetrical, as above intimated. The supe- 

 riorly flattened or shelving occiput is seen in some of the Peruvian skulls, as 

 in Nos. 571, 631, and others. No. 696 has an occipital region very much like 

 that figured in Vimont's Atlas, plate 96, fig. 2 ; while Nos. 1420, 1425, and 

 all the casts of skulls found on the Island of Titicaca, resemble, in the con- 

 formation of the occiput, the cranium represented in Table 1 of Fitzinger's 

 Essay Ueber die Schcidel der Avaren. 



The skulls of Aymaras, from Bolivia and Peru, figured by D'Orbigny, have 

 projecting occiputs.* 



The Mexican crania in the Academy's collection differ from each other in the 

 form of the occipital region. 



A female skull (34), of this great family, obtained from Acapacingo, in the 

 Valley of Cuernavaca, about fifty miles south of the City of Mexico, and 

 regarded by Morton as belonging I o the Tlahuican nation, exhibits an occiput 

 moderately full and somewhat flattened above the slightly protuberant occipital 

 boss. Two ancient Mexican crania (734, 735), exhumed near the Indian 

 village of Guahapan, on the Mountain Popocatapetl, and perhaps of Aztec 

 origin, differ in the shape of the hind head. No. 734 is asymmetrical, the 

 right half of the occiput being flattened and pressed forward, while the left is 

 undisturbed. The hind-head, as a whole, however, is full ; and were it not 

 for the lateral flattening, might be regarded as rounded, or even almost 

 globular. In 735, on the other hand, the hind-head is narrower, and owing

to the strong development of the occipital protuberance, quite prominent, and 

 somewhat shelving from above downwards and backwards. Two skulls 

 (714, 715), from an ancient Mexican cemetery, at Otumba, have full, and 

 more or less rounded occiputs. In another skull from Otumba (716), the 

 hind-head is much more protuberant. (See Crania Americana, plates 59, 60. 

 and 61.) In three crania (717, 718, and 720) from an ancient tomb at 

 Tacuba, the hind-head is high, broad at the base, and the whole occipital 

 bone prominent. The general form of the occipital region is shown in the 

 outline wood-cut at the bottom of p. 233 of Crania Americana. Two Otomie 

 crania (1323 and 1000), possess the same form of occiput. Three other 

 Otomie skulls (1001, 1002, and 1003), have the hind-head elongated and 

 shelving, and the occipital protuberance projecting very much. A short 

 Tlascalan skull (1004), has a full and globular occiput. In the cranium of the 

 Chechemecan female (1005), from a mound at Tezcuco, the occiput is more 

 like that of Nos. 1001, 1002, and 1003 of the Otomie group. No. 1226, in the 

 collection of the Academy, is the skull of a Mexican, from the cemetery of 

 Santiago de Tlatilolco, near the City of Mexico. In this cemetery, many 

 thousands of the natives were interred after the brave defence of their 

 city against Cortes. It is probable, therefore that the individual to whom the 

 skull belonged, stood up manfully in resistance to Spanish aggression. The 

 hind-head is broad and very much flattened in the posterior parietal and 

 upper occipital portions. The well-marked transverse ridge forms a promi- 

 nent dividing angle between the superior and inferior portions of the os 

 occipitis. The occiput of the two Pames skulls (681, 1313), from San 

 Lorenzo, near the City of Mexico, is much like that of 1323 and 1000 of the 

 Otomie group. In the skull of an ancient Mexican chief (1314) exhumed 

 together with various aboriginal arms and utensils, from the Cerro de Que- 

 silas, near the City of Mexico, the occiput is of a peculiar form. It is broad, 

 but has very little vertical diameter, owing to the flatness of the crown. The I 

 whole head looks as if it had been compressed between two opposing forces, 

 one applied at the top and the other at the base of the cranium. In No. 682 

 the occipital region is flat, very high, and comparatively narrow. Owing 

 to the parallelism of the two sides, it is oblong from above downwards. 

 No. 234, said to be taken from the great Altar of Sacrifices, at Mexico, is 

 remarkably flattened behind, and chiefly to the right of tbe median line. The 

 occiput of 1353 is singularly distorted. A broad and deep sulcus or fissure 

 extends in the median line, from a little before the coronal suture, entirely 

 back to the foramen magnum, dividing the whole calvaria into two lobes. The 

 occiput in 1566 is full and rounded. Of the two Lipan skulls, No. 1345 has a 

 full and regularly rounded occiput ; No. 1346 a longer and more protuberant 

 one. The remainder of the Mexican crania enumerated in the catalogue, from 

 1515 to 689, have full, and more or less protuberant occiputs. 



No. 722, from the battle field of San Jacinto, in Texas, exhibits a very 

 peculiar form. 



Some time ago, Dr. E. H. Abaddie, of the United States Army, presented to 

 the Academy a series of six crania procured in New Mexico. These skulls 

 are of considerable interest. Two of them, Nos. 1032 and 1033, were obtained 

 from the ruins of Gran Quivira, New Mexico, by Major Carleton, who ex- 

 plored the ruins thoroughly. No. 1034 was disinterred by Dr. Abaddie, from 

 the centre of the ruins of the church at Gtuarra, New Mexico. No. 931, a 

 fragmentary skull, was found, with many other human remains, in a very 

 bad state of preservation, in making excavations in an old field in Santa Fe, 

 New Mexico. "This head," writes Dr. Abaddie, "and the accompanying 

 remains, evidently belonged to the same race of Indians which formed the 

 numerous population of the large towns, long since in ruins, and of which so 

 little is known, as Gran Quivira, Abo, Guarra, Pecos, Old Church, &c." 



All these heads are brachy cephalic, and in all of them the occiput is more 



fSept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 413 



or less flattened. No. 1032 exhibits a perpendicular or wall-like flatness of 

 the hind-head. Nos. 1034 and 931 are asymmetrical. In the first the occiput 

 is flattened, chiefly to the right of the median line ; in the other mainly to 

 the left. No. 930, the skull of a Pueblo Indian, taken from the church-yard 

 of the village of Laguna, and 1035, the skull of Jose Largo, a Mescalero chief, 

 who was killed in an affray near Bosque Redondo, not far from the Pecos 

 river, New Mexico, are both dolichocephalic heads. The occiput of the first is 

 shelving ; that of the second, rounded. 



The Academy's collection contains three other New Mexican heads, which 

 were procured and forwarded by Mr. Geo. Gibbs to Dr. J. H. B. McClellan, 

 who placed them in the Museum of the Academy. One, of them (No. 935), 

 is the skull of a chief of the Mogoyon Apache Indians, who was killed by the 

 Navajo Indians, in a little ravine leading up the side of the Mesa de los Lobos, 

 to the right of the Port Defiance road, and at the head of Canon del Gallo, 

 New Mexico. The occiput of this skull is prominent, and somewhat inclined 

 from above downwards and backwards. No. 936 is the skull of a Navajo* 

 Indian, picked up on the road leading from Albuquerque to Fort Defiance, at 

 a place called the "Lake," situated on the Pacific slope of the Rocky Moun- 

 tains, six miles from the summit. In the cranium, the occipital region is 

 flatly round. No. 937, the skull of a Pueblof Indian, of Laguna, New 

 Mexico, possesses a vertically flattened occiput. 



The negro crania in the Museum of the Academy exhibit a remarkable 

 agreement in the shape of the occipital region. Of the group marked "Ameri- 

 can born," in the Catalogue, Nos. 1, 2, 69, 74, 421, 548, 1301, 1302, 1318, 

 1320, 235, and 236, are all oblong heads, with prominent, and more or less 

 shelving occiputs. In Nos. 74 and 548 the basal portion of the occipital bone 

 is very much compressed or flattened, like some of the Malay skulls. Nos. 

 549, 900, and 984 of this group have the occiputs more or less rounded. 

 With the exception of Nos. 580, 1098, and 1101, in which the occiput is flat- 

 tened at the base, and No. 1093, the occipital region of which is full and 

 rounded, all the skulls of the native African group in the collection are long 

 heads with prominent occiputs, which in form are sometimes shelving or in- 

 clined, sometimes oval, and occasionally narrow, and somewhat acuminated. 

 The same statement applies in great measure to the two Hovah, and all the 

 Australian skulls in the collection. No. 435, an Oceanic negro, is a short 

 head, with the occiput inferiorly flattened. No. 1343, a Tasmanian from Van 

 Diemen's Land, has a protuberant occipital region. 



In table 6, 7, and 8 of Blumenbach's Decades Craniorum, the protuberant 

 occiput of the negro is very well shown. In tables 17, 18, and 19, the form 

 varies in several respects. The normal form of the negro occiput, and that to 

 which the great majority of the African skulls in the Academy's collection 

 conforms, is well illustrated in plates 2 and 3 of Prof. Van der Hoeven's 

 valuable treatise entitled " Bijdrageu tot de Natuurlijke Geschiedenis van den 

 Negerstam. ' ' The protuberant occiput of the Ethiopian is also exhibited in 



*"This tribe," writes a valued correspondent, Mr. Geo. Gibbs, "is said to number 

 1,200 souls, and to be a decidedly pastoral people, having in their possession at the pre- 

 sent time (July, 1857), 60,000 horses, and 350,000 sheep. They can bring 2500 war- 

 riors into the field at one time. Their skulls are exceedingly difficult to procure, on 

 account of their habit of stowing the dead away in hidden places." 



t '* These Indians," says Mr. Gibbs, " get their name from the Spanish word pueblo, 

 because they live in little towns or villages, cultivating the soil in the neighborhood of 

 the same. It is said that New Mexico boasts of twenty-seven of these pueblos at the 

 present time, differing in population from 40 to 2,500 souls. Some of the principal 

 pueblos are named Pugblo of Taos, Zuni, Laguna, San Felipe, Santa Domingo, Sandia, 

 Isleta, and Acoma. With but few exceptions, the inhabitants speak different languages, 

 though all of lhem use the Spanish. Nominally they are Catholics, having chapels in 

 their midst, yet they continue to worship Montezuma (whom they believe to be residing 

 in the sun), day and night, by means of never ceasing religious dances."

table 7 of Dr. Lucae's " Organischen Formenlelire, " a work containing many 

 interesting craniographic details. 

 From the foregoing facts we may conclude : 



1. That the form of the human occiput is not constant. On the contrary, 

 it varies continually in the different races and tribes of men. It varies, also, 

 to a greater or less extent, among the individuals of the same race or tribe. 



2. That the different occipital forms may be divided into five classes or 

 groups, which are reducible, however, to three. These are, 1st. The pro- 

 tuberant or prominent occiput, with the upper or parietal half somewhat 

 flattened, so as to present an inclined or shelving appearance. (See p. 399.) 

 2d. The vertically flattened. 3d. The inferiorly flattened or compressed, in 

 which the basal portion of the occiput slants upwards and backwards, as is 

 shown in a strongly marked degree, in the Sandwich Islander head, fig. 69, 

 on page 340 of "Indigenous Races of the Earth." 4th. The round. And 

 5th. The globular. As the last two merge more or less into each other, and 

 as the third form may be regarded as, in many instances, a modification of 

 the second, these five forms may, with greater simplicity, be thrown into three 

 groups, viz. : 1st. The prominent and oval, or superiorly inclined. 2d. The 

 perpendicularly flattened. And 3d. The more or less round or globular. 



3. That to the first of these groups belong the Norwegians, Swedes, and 

 some other Scandinavians ; the Frisians and Batavians,* among the low 

 Germans ; the Anglo-Saxons and Anglo-Americans, the form of the occiput in 

 these being between that of the Swedes and Germans ; the Celtic Irish, and 

 some tribes of the ancient Britons ; the Phoenicians, Circassians, Armenians, 

 Affghans, Baluchi ; some of the Egyptians and Arabs, the Fellahs, Abys- 

 sinians, and Guanches of the Canary Isles ; some of the Hindoos and Chinese ; 

 the Loo-Chooans, certain Malays ; the Eskimos, Kamskatkans, Reindeer Tun- 

 gus, Icelanders, Tchuktcki, Unalaschkans, some of the Kanakas, Tahitians, 

 and others of the Sandwich Islands, Marquesans, of Nukahivah, New 

 Zealanders, Feejeeans, and most of the African tribes. Among the aboriginal 

 Americans, this form is exhibited by the Arickarees, Assinaboins, Cherokees, 

 Chippeways ; some of the Kootenays, Creeks, and Dacotas ; by the Hurons, 

 and probably the Illinois ; by some of the Iroquois and most of the Lenapes ; 

 by the Mandans, Minetaris, Menominees, Miamis, Mohawks, and most of the 

 Narragansetts, the Naticks, some of the Osages, Ottawatomies. Pawnees, and 

 Sauks ; by most of the Seminoles, by the Shawnees, Shoshone, Upsarookas, 

 Californians, Cayugas, Cheyennes, Choctaws, Massasaugas, Mingos, Naum- 

 keags, Mayas of Central America ; by some of the Araucanians, the Charibs, 

 Patagonians, Brazilians, Aymaras, and by some of the ancient Mound Builders, 

 Peruvians, and Mexicans. 



In the kumbekephalic variety of skulls, this form of occiput is often very 

 much exaggerated, as is seen in certain ancient Cimbrian, Ostrogoth, and Bur- 

 gundian heads ; in some Egyptians and Celtic Irish, and in one Creek Indian 

 skull. 



4. That of the second form of occiput, or that in which the hind-head is 

 more or less vertically flattened, we find examples in some of the ancient in- 

 habitants of Scandinavia ; the Lapps, Samoiedes, Iberians, or Basques of the 

 Pyrenees ; the ancient Pelasgi ; Cossacks, Hungarians, Candaharians, some 

 Arabs ; one Chinese, the Siamese, some Malays and Javanese ; certain tribes 

 of the Transgangetic, or Indo-Chinese Peninsula, and. occasionally among 

 the Tahitians. To this group belong, also, the skulls of Chetimache, Natchez, 

 Otoe, Kenehawha, Oneida, Seneca, and Puelche Indians ; likewise a portion 

 of the Kootenays, Lenapes, Miamis, Osages, Ottawas, Pottawatomies, 

 Shoshones, Araucanians, Peruvians, and the majority of the Mound Builders. 



Examples of the inferiorly flattened modification of, or deviation from this 

 type, are found in some of the Malays, Polynesians, &c. 



* See Catalogus Craniorum Diversarum Gentium quae Collegia, J. Van der Hoeven, p. 14. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 415 



5. That the third form, in which the occiput is full and rounded, or 

 globular, comprises the Danes, Finns, Esthonians ; the short-headed Germans, 

 whose crania, in general conformation, occupy a place between those of the 

 Swedes and Finns ; the Dutch, some tribes of the ancient Britons ; the Sclaves, 

 Turks, Greeks, Romans, Etruscans, Persians, ancient Assyrians, some of the 

 Egyptians, Hebrews, Copts, Hindoos ; some of the Chinese, Japanese, Bur- 

 mese, Malays ; the Kalmucks, Burats, and some of the Kanakas. To this 

 group belong, of the American Indians, the Ottigamies, Penobscots, Winne- 

 bagos, Yamasees, Chemasyans, Euchees, Nanticokes, Pocassets, Quinni- 

 piacks, or Mohegans, and a portion of the Cheyennes, Creeks, Dacotas, 

 Iroquois, Narragansetts, Pawnees, Pottawatomies, Sauks, Seminoles, Arauca- 

 nians, Peruvians, and Mound Builders. 



6. That the shelving or oval form of the occiput is most common in the 

 dolichokephalic heads, and as these predominate in number over the brachy- 

 kephalic, it is the most common form of all. Next comes the round or 

 globular, and lastly the vertically flat both these forms prevailing in the 

 brachykephalse. 



7. That there is a marked tendency of these forms to graduate into each 

 other, more or less insensibly. None of these forms can be said to belong 

 exclusively to any race or tribe. None of them, therefore, can be regarded as 

 strictly typical, for, a character or form, to be truly typical, should be ex- 

 clusive and constant.

 Mr. Ashmead in the Chair. 



Thirty members present. 



Dr. Leidy directed attention to three broken fossil teeth, which had been 

 sent to him for examination by Dr. Shumard. They were from Washing- 

 ton Co., Texas, and indicated a miocene formation like that of Nebraska, 

 which has proved to be so rich in remains of extinct mammalia. Two of the 

 specimens belonged to a species of Hippotherium ; the other appeared to 

 indicate a new equine genus, different from any of those obtained by Dr. 

 Hayden on the Niobrara River.

Systematic Catalogue, with Synonyma, &c, of Jurassic, Cretaceous and 

 Tertiary Fossils collected in Nebraska, by the Exploring Expeditions under 

 the command of Lieut. G. K. Warren, of U. S. Topographical Engineers. 



BY F. B. MEEK AND F. V. HAYDEN. 



Of the 276 species and varieties enumerated in the following catalogue, 25 ai 

 from Jurassic rocks, 194 from Cretaceous, and the remaining 57 from Tertiary 

 strata. None of the Jurassic species are known to occur in this country east 

 of the Black Hills, or south of the middle of eastern Utah, though some of 

 them will probably be found in New Mexico. One species is believed to be 

 identical with Ostrea calceola of Roemer from the Jurassic rocks of Germany, 

 and another {Ammonites cordiformis) is probably not distinct from A. cord< 

 Sowerby, which occurs in the Jurassic series of England, France, Russia, &c. 

 Nearly all the other Jurassic species mentioned in the list are closely allied 

 to forms common in the lower part of that system (the Lower Oolite aud 

 Lias) in the old world, and several of them may prove identical on farther com- 

 parison. 



Of the 194 Cretaceous species the following seven are common to the 

 Nebraska and New Jersey beds viz. Nautilus Dekayi, Ammonites placenta, 

 A. complexus*, A. lobatus*, Scaphites Conradi, Baculites ovatus, and Gryphon 

 oesicidaris ? ; and the following five species are probably common to Nebraska 

 and foreign localities, viz. Nautilus Dekayi, Inoceramus problematicus, Gry- 

 phcea vesicularis, Cuculloza fibrosa, and Micorbacia coranula. 



The 57 Tertiary species are believed to be all distinct from foreign forms, and 

 none of them have yet been found in this country east of Nebraska, or south 

 of north eastern Utah. They are all, so far as known, extinct species.

* We propose to establish a new genus, under the name of Margaritella, for the 

 reception of many pearly Jurassic and Cretaceous shells usually referred to Solarium. 

 It is evident from the pearly lustre, and other characters of these fossil shel!s, that they 

 do not even belong to the same family as our recent typical species of the genus Archi- 

 tectonica (= Solarium.) The above species may be regarded as the type of the genus.

Observations on American Tineina. 



BY H. T. STAINTON, OF LONDON.* 



Tinea biflavimaculella. This is closely allied if not identical with 

 T. Spilotella (see Linn. Ent. vi. p. 108, Rusticella, var. b.) Spilotella 

 appears confined to the north of Europe, occurring in Finland and Scotland. 



T. dorsistrigella, is allied to T. f er ruginel la, but the markings 

 much are whiter and the dorsal streak is broader. T. nubilipennella is identical 

 with our T. fuscipunctella. 



T. lanariella, is identical with our everywhere abundant T. bis el- 

 lie 1 1 a. 



Xylesthia pruniramiella. This curious genus appears to be rather 

 allied to Ochsenheimeria ; another strange genus in this vicinity, Hapsifera, 

 was founded by Zeller, in the Isis of 1847, p. 32. 



Amydria effrenatella. I am disposed to place this in the genus 

 Euplocamus ; the palpi are very like those of E. tessulat ella, Z. (Linn. 

 Ent. vi. p. 9(3. )f 



Anaphora plumifrontella. I am utterly perplexed with this ; we have 

 no European form at all resembling it. 



Lithocolletis lucidicostella ) These are allied to the group of 

 L. argentifimbriella, J Cramerella, Tenella and Heegeriella. 



L. basistrigella. This is nearly allied to a South European species, 

 Suberifoliella, (Zell. Entomol. Zeitung, 1850, p. 208); but it is smaller, the 

 basal streak is shorter, the subapical streaks are more distinct and the ground 

 color darker. 



Tischeria citrinipennella. This is rather intermediate between the 

 European Complanella and Marginea ; it possesses a black spot at the anal 

 angle, as in the last named species. 



Phyllocnistis vitigenella. This is closely allied to our Suffusella and 

 Saligna ; but it is smaller, "and the position of the subapical dorsal streak is 

 different. 



Coleophora coruscipennella. This is very nearly allied to our C. 

 Fabriciella; but the anterior wings are a little browner. The antenna? 

 quite agree with those of Fabriciella. 



Plutella vigilaciella. This is our P. porrectella; you will find the 

 larva in gardens on Hesperis matronalis. 



Plutella limbipennella. This is our P. cruciferarum; it seems 

 cosmopolitan, as I have seen specimens from various parts of the globe. 

 Probably wherever man eats cabbages Cruciferarum will occur. 



Argyresthia oreasella. This seems quite identical with our A. A n d e r- 

 eggiella. 



*Mr. Stainton has very kindly sent me the following observations, on a small lot of 

 American Tineina, forwarded to him late in July. In return, I am indebted to him for 

 an interesting suite of European genera and specimens of those insects which he considers 

 identical with ours. It is quite needless for me lo say that I regard any opinion Mr. 

 Stain tun may deliberately form, on questions of classification, to be final. 



After having examined a specimen of the genus Simaethis, 1 must acknowledge that 

 Brenthia seems congeneric with it. Whether the former genus naturally belongs to the 

 Pyralidina must be left for future determination. My own opinion at present is, that it is 

 improperly included in this well-marked group. Brackenridge Clemens. 



tThis is true of the labial palpi ; but the auxiliary palpi in Amydria are extremely short. 



I860.] 




134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Bedellia ? Staintoniella. Certainly a Bedellia, and I cannot distinguish 

 it specifically from our Somnulentella, only it is smaller. 



Cosmopteryx? gemmiferella. A true Cosmopteryx ; but your specimens 

 are not all the same species ; four of them I take to be the true Gemmiferella . 

 These have the central fascia re<MsA-orange, edged with silvery violet. This 

 fascia is considerably broadest on the costa, its hinder margin being formed by 

 two silvery- violet spots, which are by no means opposite ; at the apex of the 

 wing is a short silvery white scale [streak?], preceded by a violet silvery 

 spot, with which it is not connected. 



The other two specimens, for which I propose the name Cosmopteryx 

 Clemensella, differ from Gemmiferella in the anterior wings being darker, 

 the orange fascia is paler, not so reddish, its margins are pale golden, instead 

 of silvery-violet, and its hind margin is almost straight, (this is very different 

 from Gemmiferella) ; finally, the apical streak is continuous, not interrupted, 

 and of a silvery white throughout. I shall describe this in an early number 

 of the "Intelligencer," in some remarks on the extra-European species of 

 Cosmopteryx. 



Anorthosia puuctipennella. This seems to be allied to Cleodora, and 

 I do not feel confident that it is generically distinct. 



Gelechia A g r i m o n i e 11 a. Allied to G. 1 i g u 1 e 1 1 a and G. tseniolella, 

 but quite distinct. 



G.? roseosuffu sella; a true Gelechia, allied to G. decurtella, (H. S. 

 Tineides, tab. 72, f. 539). 



G. Rhoifructella. This has considerable resemblance with our G. 

 Populella; but the anterior wings are broader and blunter, and the anterior 

 segments of the body are not pale. 



G.? rubidella; a true Gelechia, somewhat allied to G. eric in ell a, but 

 smaller, and the anterior wings narrower. 



G. detersella. I am uncertain about this ; it is perhaps allied to our 

 moss-feeding G. af finis. The name detersella, must be altered, that name 

 having been'used by Zeller for a Sicilian species of the genus (Isis, 1847). 



The genus Gelechia, as at present constituted, is very elastic, and includes 

 a variety of slightly different forms. G. subocelleais our most discordant 

 species. 



Strobisia iridipennella. ) These are very different from anything in 

 S. emblemella. ) Europe, and the form of wing in Iridi- 



pennella is so peculiar that you are clearly justified in forming a new 

 genus ; it is not improbably a connecting link between Gelechia and Glyphip- 

 teryx. 



Butalis flavifrontella. \ Zeller has described in the Linnsea Ento- 



B. mat u tell a. J mologica, vol. x., several North American 



species of Butalis. His Basilaris, p. 230, is perhaps identical with your 



Flavifrontella, and his Impositella, p. 241, may have been described from a 



worn specimen of your M a t u t el 1 a. 



Stilbosis t e s q u e 1 1 a. This is a very curious insect, resembling in form 

 of wing Asychna seratella; the ornamentation is more like some of the 

 Lavernse. 



Chrysocorys Erythtiella. This is a true Chrysocorys. 



Brenthia Pavonacella. I am disposed to consider this not a Tineina, 

 but rather one of the Pyralidina, allied to Simaethis ; but I have never observed 

 the strutting habit in any of our species. 



Pigritia laticapitella. This is an obscure looking insect of doubtful 

 location, reminding one most strongly of some of the aberrant Butalidse.

Descriptions of new Corals in the Museum of the Academy. 



BY GEO. H. HORN. 



Madrepora perampla. 



M. crasse foliata, frondibus profunde digitato-lobatis ; lobis late elongatis 

 (saepe 2' longis, 4" 8" latis, et 1" 4" crassis). Corallum infra, caliculis 

 confertis (1'" \\'" longis) ; supra tubiforrnibus, inequalibus (2'" 3'" longis 

 et \\'" latis) erectis, nunquani nariforrnibus ; Stella conspicuii, duabus 

 lamellis latioribus. 



The broad and thick lobes of this species distinguish it from either the M. 

 alcesor M. palmata. The calicles are elongated, and with a distinct 

 star. Immersed cells numerous, equalling in this respect the prominent 

 calicles. The lobes are broad, and arise from a common pedicle, which is 

 very stout (4" 6") ; they also show a tendency to further subdivision. 



Locality. West Indies. Dr. J. H. Slack. 



Madrepora subaquila. 



M. crasse digitata, (lobis 2' longis, 3" latis et 2J" crassis). Corallum infra 

 caliculis confertis (1" longis); supra tubiforrnibus, inequalibus (2'" longis et 

 V" latis); stella inconspicua. 



The above description was derived from a branch, two feet in length, of a 

 frond, whose mode of growth was nearly horizontal, judging from the relation 

 of the calicles to the upper surface. This species differs materially from any 

 of the digitato-palmate madrepores heretofore described, in its mode of 

 growth, its large calicles, and its inconspicuous star. Its color is light 

 brownish exteriorly. 



Locality. Unknown. 



Madrepora t u b i g e r a . 



M. prostrata, ramis paulum diffusis, stricte ramosis ; ramulis attenuati.s 

 (base 3'"), apice aeutis. Corallum porosum, caliculo apicale elongato, cylin- 

 drico (3'" 4'" saepe 5'" longo et '" lato) ; lateralibus tubiforrnibus, saepe 

 labellatis et dimidiatis ; stella conspicuii. 



This species is well marked. Its much elongated and delicate apical calicle 

 distinguishing it from all known prostrate branching madrepores. 



Locality. Unknown. Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Merulina speciosa. 



M. explanato-ramosa, late undata ; margine lobata, unifronte ; superne 

 ramis confertis (2 3" altis). Corallum collibus rotundatis (1'" altis). 

 lamellis aequalibus serrulatis. 



This species differs from any other of the genus Merulina in its branches 

 arising from an explanate base. It grows in large subhemispherical clumps 

 (10" 13" in diameter). The thickness of the explanate portion is often 

 three lines. Its under surface is strongly ribbed, coarsely striate, and 

 granulous. 



Locality. Unknown. Dr. T. B. Wilson. 



Agaricia anthrophylla. 



A. late explanata, undata. Corallum margine fragile.* Buperficie infe- 

 riore striata ; superne laminis erectis (1 3" altis) coalitis et meandrinis 

 (saepe 8" longis) ; collibus elongatis et aequalibus (1 1%'" altis et latis) 

 lamellis crassis confertissimis. 



Grows in subhemispherical clumps, attached below by its centre. It differs 

 from the other Agariciae in its vertical and coalescing plates. The lamellae are 

 stout, being greater in thickness than the width of the spaces between them. 

 Corallum thin at the edges, interiorly measuring from three to five lines. 



Locality. Unknown. Dr. T. B. Wilson.

436 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Catalogue of Carboniferous Plants in the Museum of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences, with corrections in Synonymy, descriptions of new Species, &c. 



BY HORATIO C. WOOD, JR. 



la the ensuing enumeration, it will be seen, that we first give our own de- 

 cision, followed occasionally by remarks on synonomy, &c; then the number 

 of specimens with labels previously affixed, in quotation marks ; then the locality, 

 as far as known followed either by the name of the donor, or of the collection 

 to which they formerly belonged, and their number in that collection. 



The Academy is indebted to Dr. T. B. Wilson for the duplicates of the " Bristol 

 Institute Collection," which form the bulk of the specimens. We do not know 

 whether the numbers on them coincide with the original collection or not. 



Those presented by Mr. J. P. Wetherill are especially interesting; many of 

 them being the types of Steinhauer, and all probably having belonged to that 

 author. They are labelled with Steinhauer's names, in the hand writing of 

 Dr. Samuel Geo. Morton. 



Besides those here enumerated, there are in the cabinet of the Academy a num- 

 ber of European vegetable reliquse from various formations. These we had pur- 

 posed arranging and cataloguing conjointly with the carboniferous ; but owing 

 to the press of other engagements must leave them till some future day. 



We know of but one other foreign collection in the United States, and the 

 partially arranged American suite of the Academy is large and increasing from 

 day to day. We think it highly important that there should be a standard 

 collection in this country, where investigators may deposit these types, and by 

 comparison with which any disputes that may arise may be settled. The city 

 of Philadelphia, the emporium of the coal trade, is certainly the proper place 

 for this. Moreover, the collection of carboniferous plants, (native and foreign,) 

 is probably much the finest in the country, numbering about a thousand speci- 

 mens. We would therefore suggest to authors the propriety of sending, as far 

 as practicable, types of their coal plants. We would also ask those living in 

 the coal region, or engaged in the trade, to send specimens to the Academy. 

 and thus forward the best interests of botanical science and practical geology. 



Ord. EQUISITACEA. 

 Equisktites, Sternb. 



E. macro do n tu s , n. sp. ? Stem simple, articulated, obsoletely costate ; 

 articulations short, swollen at the joints ; sheaths multidentate ; teeth longer 

 than articulations, contracting at their base, expanded (and united ?) above, 

 then rapidly contracting, and terminating in a greatly elongated setaceous point, 

 (? furnished on one border with a second short setaceous point.) Fructification 

 not preserved. 



Our specimen is a flattened impression on coal shales, the terminal sheath 

 only being distinct. It is impossible to say with certainty, whether the second 

 points belong to the large teeth, or whether they are the terminations of a 

 smaller set placed between them.

 but as the name is considered pre-Linnsan by authorities in that department of palaeonto- 

 logy, and replaced by Syringopora, Goldfuss, of course we do not change it as applied to 

 fossil botany.

We have identified this species with some hesitation, as its only distinguish- 

 ing characteristic, (according to its discoverer,) is its irregularity. Our speci- 

 men perfectly possesses that peculiarity ! 



Besides the%bove, there are quite a number of foreign specimens of this 

 genus in the cabinet, but, unfortunately, their specific characteristics are not 

 sufficiently preserved for their identification.

What influenced lions. Brongniart in altering his first chosen name, we are 

 unable to divine, unless he did it for the sake of euphony. And why not 

 change Asterophj'llites to Asterophyllum, on the same principle? Of course 

 the first name must stand to the exclusion of the more euphonious.

We do not hesitate in re-uniting these forms, separated by Mons. Brongniart. 

 He says, that he has never seen a specimen of N. g i g a n t e a, St., yet erects his 

 specimens into new species on such differential characters as, " ia the one, the 

 pinules overlap by a little of their border, in the other, there is a little space 

 between them." Every tyro in recent botany knows that, among the ferns, the 

 same plant varies in its different portions more than this. And we have 

 specimens of this species, less than two inches in length, that do so. That the 

 species of this genus do vary very much, is shown by N. h i r s u t a, Lesq., the 

 several forms of which differ from one another much more than do any of 

 these.f

*Perhaps some naturalists would consider that this genus should receive the name of 

 Casuarinites, of which division of the old authors it is a section. But their genera of fossil 

 plants were so vague that all modern authorities agree in discarding them. If we revive 

 Casuarinites, Filicites, Phytolithus, &c, must also come again into use, much to the 

 detriment of an already complicated and difficult branch of science. Moreover, as A. 

 e quiaetiformis may be considered the type of the genus of Schlotheim, his name 

 would rather take the place of Asterophyllites. 



tWheiher botanists agree with us in considering these forms as belonging to one 

 species or not, N. minor, nobis, will have to replace N. Loschii, Br., and the 

 specific name minor thus being pre-occupied, we would suggest N. p a r v a, instead oi 

 N. minor, Lesq. It may be objected by some that N. minor is pre-Linnajan, 

 but the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae, in which the binomial nomenclature is 

 employed, was published 1758 ; and we hold it to be a great injustice to earlier writers to 

 reject their names when they are binomial.

 twelve), but rapidly and repeatedly forking, so that at margin they are very 

 numerous and close. 



The only specimen of this species which we have seen, has the nerves and 

 interior of the leaf, as well as its base, perfectly preserved ; but towards the 

 margin, it becomes so indistinct, that we speak with great doubt as to its 

 lobation and serration. The disposition and flexuosity of its nerves separate 

 it widely, however, from all heretofore known species.

We label these specimens thus, solely on account of their being so labelled 

 in England. Sternberg first described the plant with the name of Lycopodites 

 dichotomum, giving an exceedingly indefinite figure and a worse description. 

 Brongniart, in his prodrome, placed it in its proper genus, changing its specific 

 name to S t e r n b e r g i i. In his Vers. ii. Sternb. again figured it, nnder the name 

 of Lep. dichotomum. To this work we have not been able to gain access. 

 But Unger, in his Genera and Species of Fossil Plants, has given a description, 

 drawn, we suppose, from it. It is worthy of remark that this description 

 does not agree, with the figure first published by Sternberg! Nor does either 

 of the two figures in the Fossil Flora, which also differ one from another! ! In 

 such a chaos, we are unable to decide what are the specific characters, or even 

 whether there are any. If the two figures published by Lindley & Hutton 

 belong to the same plant, we see no character by which L. d i 1 a t a t u m, of the 

 same authors, can be separated from them. From some unknown cause, Unger 

 does not notice L. dil atatu m, neither as a good species, nor yet as a synonym.

Phytolithus notatus, Steinhaur. S. elliptica, Br. (_S. notata, Br.) ? 



We have but little hesitation in uniting these forms. If S. notata, Brong., 

 is distinct from /S. elliptica, Brong., it is also distinct from Phytolithus notatus, 

 Steinhauer, which is identical with S. elliptica. The sharp angles and pro- 

 elongations from them, mentioned by Brongniart as characterizing S. notata, 

 Brong., do not exist, either in Steinhauer's figure, or in specimens in pos- 

 session of the Academy, which, in all probability, are Steinhauer's types. 



* Were it not for the possession of this type, we would not, perhaps, be warranted in 

 giving so positively the synonymy of this species ; but having this, we are enabled to 

 deride regarding the points above given. 



t In our classification of this genus we shall follow Goldenburg (Die Pflanzen, des 

 Steinkolen, von Saarbuck, 1857), and reduce the genera indicated by us (Pr. A. JS. S. 

 1860), to the rank of sub-genera. Although we have some hesitation as to the propriety 

 of this, yet it is, perhaps, the better course, as these sub-genera approximate in indefinite- 

 ness to the genus Sigillaria. They have, without doubt, the same value as Syringoden- 

 dron, and, in our opinion, the Sigillaria constitutes an order, and the present sub-genera 

 the genera of it; bu the weight of authority is against this. Under this classification 

 the American forms described by us will stand S. perplexa.S. camptotaenia, 

 & s o 1 a n u s , S. magnifica, S. psilophloeus.

We have, however, specimens so directly intermediate between S. notata, 

 Br., and S. elliptica, Br., that we think the two species must be united. If 

 not, S. notata, Br., will require a new name, and we would suggest S.

curved, much longer than the pale yellow corolla. Calyx campanulate, 

 divisions obtuse, pedicels short, whole panicle subpubescent. Flowers dense. 

 Leaflets 7, glabrous, ovate-lanceolate, acute at both ends, sharply and unequally 

 serrate. Shrub 3-5 feet high, with a smooth bark. Flowers in March. Panicles 

 4-6 inches long. Leaflets 2-4 inches long. 

 Hills in the vicinity of Larissa, Texas. 



Halesia reticulata. Leaves broad-ovate, pubescent on the midribs, 

 scabrous, obscurely dentate, teeth small, acute, under surface of leaves 

 pale, much reticulated. Fruit 4-winged, two lateral wings double in width 

 the others. Style long, mucronate. Leaves 4-5 inches long and 2-3A inches 

 broad. Fruit smooth, 1-1J inches long, and 6-7 lines broad. Pedicles 5-7 

 lines long. Small trees, branches smooth, bark of trunk light gray, furrowed. 



Banks of streams tributary to the Red River, above Nachitoches, Louisiana. 



Fraxinus Nuttalli i. Leaflets 5-7 , lanceolate, acute at both ends, irregu- 

 larly toothed, upper surface smooth, under surface pale and subpubescent 

 along the midribs, short-stalked, petioles long, glabrous, fruit ovate-lanceolate, 

 three-winged acute at both ends, branches smooth, bark of trunk gray, and 

 furrowed. Fruit about 2 inches long, by 5 lines broad. Leaflets 3-4 inches 

 long by 1 inch broad, sometimes unequal at base. 



In swamp?, Wilcox County, Alabama. Small trees about 6 inches in 

 diameter, and 20-25 feet high. As Nuttall had not material for a complete 

 description, none can tell what is meant by his Fraxinus triptera; but as 

 possibly he may have intended the tree now described, I call it Nuttall's Ash. 



Gary a Tex an a. Leaflets 7-9, broad -ovate, or ovate-lanceolate, sharply 

 serrate, smooth on both sides, paler beneath, acute at apex, subobtuse or 

 acute at base. Staminate and pistillate catkins subpubescent. Fruit globular, 

 slightly 4-angled. Shell thin, separating to the base. Trees three to four feet 

 in diameter, and forty to fifty feet high. Bark of trunk very thick, deeply 

 and irregularly furrowed, not scaly. Leaflets 6-8 inches long, and 2-3 inches 

 broad. 



Dry soil. Common in Upper Louisiana, and in Texas extending as far west 

 as Atacosa County. " Thick bark, hickory." 



Q,uercus Shumardi i. Leaves oblong, or obovate in outline, smooth, 

 deeply sinuate-pinnatifid, sinuses broad, convergent, 3-5 on each side, lobes 

 many-toothed, teeth sharply and setaceously acute. Acorn globular, or 

 ovoid-oblong, subacute, cup shallow, slightly turgid, scales acute. A large 

 tree with shining deep green leaves, those on the upper portion of the tree 

 being much and deeply lobed. The lunes are generally deeper near the 

 petiole than towards the apex of the leaf. Acorn resembles Q. rubra, but is 

 more acute, 1-1 ^ inch long, and 6 lines to 1 inch broad. Limbs, trunk and 

 branches much like the water-oak, Q. aquatic a. Wood yellowish-white, 

 fine grained, and esteemed for rails, boards, and the frame-work of buildings. 

 I have measured specimens which were six feet in diameter, with an estimated 

 height of 70-80 feet. Its leaves retain their greenness long after the first 

 frosts, when those of the frost-oak, black-jack and scarlet-oak are dead. 



It occurs in Upper Louisiana, Eastern and Middle Texas. Shumard's Oak. 

 In honor of Dr. B. F. Shumard, State Geologist of Texas. 



Ouercus Texana. Leaves ovate-oblong in outline, smooth, both sides 

 deeply sinuate-pinnatifid, with broad, divergent sinuses, 3-5 on each side, 

 lobes 1-3 toothed, teeth acute setaceous. Nut ovoid, oblong, acute, cup 

 hemispherical, slightly turgid, scales acute, closely appressed. Tree 3-5 feet 

 in diameter, and 60-70 feet high, branches smooth, bark of trunk of a dark 

 slate color, slightly furrowed, very like Q. phellos and Q. a q u a t i c a, with 

 which it is often associated. Lower leaves of this tree with lobes often 

 truncate, while the upper leaves have deep, broad, divergent sinuses, and the

upper lobes prolonged somewhat like those of Q. falcata. Like the water 

 and willow-oaks, its leaves are green during the first of winter. Acorn about 

 1 inch long, and J J inch broad. Leaves 4-8 inches long by 3-5 wide. A 

 beautiful tree, with dense, deep green foliage. Wood close-grained, white, or 

 of a light red color, and used for similar purposes as the Shumard Oak. 



Quercus Durandii. Leaves obovate, entire, or slightly 3-lobed at apex, 

 with rudiments of one or more lobes at the margins, lobes very obtuse. When 

 mature, smooth on both sides. Acorn round, or ovoid rotund. Cup very 

 shallow, scales acute, closely appressed. Leaves 3^ inches long, 1-2 inches 

 wide. Acorns ->- | inch long, about h inch wide, scarcely one-eighth of an inch 

 being included in the cup. Tree 2-3 feet in diameter, and 40-50 feet high, 

 bark of trunk, and branches light gray, scaly, resembling the white oak 

 (Q. Alba). The leaves are mostly entire, varying from obovate to oblong- 

 ovate. Wood white, close-grained, and very tough. It is often worked into 

 splints for baskets to hold the picked cotton. Used for farming utensils, and 

 sought after to make screws for cotton gins. Called "Basket Oak," and 

 ^'Bastard White Oak."

Quercus annulata. Leaves broad-ovate, entire or irregularly and 

 sparingly lobed, sinuses shallow, divergent lobes very obtuse, upper surface 

 smooth and bright green, under surface pale, smooth, or subpubescent, petioles 

 short. Acorn oblong-ovoid, with a depressed ring near the apex. Style 

 cylindrical, long, truncate, cup shallow, one-third the length of the acorn. 

 Acorn 5-9 lines long, and 3-4 lines broad. Leaves 2-4 inches long, mostly 

 lobed. Bark of trunk and branches light gray, scaly. Small tree or shrub, 

 bearing a great abundance of acorns. 



Common on the rocky limestone hills in the vicinity of Austin, Texas. 



Note on Quercia coccinea. 



In Upper Louisiana and in Eastern Texas, last autumn, I often found 

 Q. coccinea with acorns depressed at the summit and leaves agreeing exactly 

 with Michaux's figure of that species, the accuracy of which has been questioned 

 by some boanists. It had not the scarlet leaves after frost which is said to 

 be characteristic of that species. Its bark is a dark gray or slate color, deeply 

 furrowed, and wood porous, of a reddish cast, and esteemed of little use.

abodes in paths and roads, on the prairies and in the fields and woods. The}' 

 form their habitations in the ground, where they have many apartments 

 connected by tunnels about an inch in diameter. Some of their cellars have 

 deep shelves on all sides, where their food is stored. Their rooms are rarely 

 found at a greater depth than six feet, nor do their cavities often extend over 

 a greater area than from four to six feet diameter, over which, at the surface, 

 there is generally a more or less conical mound, sometimes as high as three 

 feet, with a principal entrance at its summit. This mound is merely the dirt 

 brought to the surface when they are making their tunnels and cellars. Many of 

 their dwellings have no mound at the surface, it having been washed away by 

 rains, and also either levelled by the hand of man or the feet of animals. We 

 first noticed the exodus of their males and females on the twenty-seventh of 

 last July, when the whole community were in a violent commotion. Then the 

 males and females issued from their doors in great crowds. Some flying away, 

 while others were seized by the neuters and dragged struggling off. During 

 the following month the females began to form new columns, commencing by 

 a few neuters joining a female and digging a small hole to shelter her. This 

 is daily and nightly enlarged, until its inhabitants and rooms become so 

 numerous that it also sends forth swarms of females, and neuters to found 

 new cities. 



Their chief food is the seed of various plants and grasses, but, like most 

 ants, they also eat flesh. They boldly attack all beetles and worms who 

 venture near their doors, when great numbers seize the unlucky intruder, and, 

 if it be a beetle, its legs are seized and body covered with ants, who bite and 

 sting at the same moment, by which the beetle is soon killed, unless at the 

 first he flies; and we have seen beetles fly away with ants hanging to their 

 legs, nor did the ants let go, at least while the beetle was in sight. The 

 stinging ant does not work during the hot sunshine ; but they labor at night 

 and during the cool of the day. On cloudy days their work continues. Indeed, 

 light is the busy time, among all or nearly all of the ants of Texas. Seeds of 

 various grasses and flowers are the principal food of the stinging ants, who, in 

 seed-time during the summer, lay up stores of food for the winter season, when 

 " Northers" come and storms rage, and confine the ants within doors sometimes 

 a week or more at a time. One of their habitations in Dr. Linsecom's garden, 

 at Long Point, in Washington County, Texas, was dug into to the depth of 

 about two feet, and large quantities of water thrown in to destroy the ants. 

 They recovered, and for several days after were busily engaged in bringing 

 their store of seeds to the surface to dry. A part of these, by heat and 

 moisture were sprouted, and unfit for preserving for future use, and these, 

 when dry, were not taken back to their cellars. Most of the seeds were those 

 of a species of geranium (Erodium Texanum). Miss Sallie Linsecom, a 

 daughter of the Doctor, went into the garden daily to see the ants bring out 

 their store of seeds, which she told us were more than half a bushel. 



Mr. C. G. Caldwell, who resides on the Colorado river, about eighteen miles 

 below Austin, has lately been digging in order to exterminate a nest. While 

 there, recently, we became acquainted with the shape of their cellars and 

 winding tunnels. Their apartments are rarely more than six or eight inches 

 in diameter, with shelves, as before stated. Often a tunnel descends vertically 

 to a room, then horizontally to another apartment, then up nearly perpen- 

 dicularly to other cells, which last rarely become wet even by very heavy rains. 

 Mr. Caldwell assured us that he had often seen their shelves full of seeds. By 

 such an arrangement of their rooms they avoid storing seeds in heaps where 

 they would be apt to spoil. During a very heavy rain at Cedar Creek Post- 

 office, in Bastrip County, that whole region seemed to be flooded; and we 

 waited with some impatience for the storm to abate, in order to see its damage 

 to the ant, the stinging ants having many nests in a prairie, which the rain 

 had covered with water. Next day we saw them bringing to the surface 



[Oct.

grass seeds to dry from their cellars. Every ant-hill in the vicinity had more 

 or less seed strown around their outer doors. A few days later we visited the 

 same locality, and the seeds had disappeared, having doubtless been stored 

 away again by the ants. 



They cannot carry as heavy burdens as the cutting ant (Myrmica Texana) 

 nor do they, like that ant, place their load upon their backs, but carry it with 

 their mandibles and head; and, whatever they wish to take home, 'is, if too 

 large, cut into segments to be thus transported. 



The stinging ants are generally peaceable in their habits, rarely fighting 

 with other species, or among themselves. In one or two instances we have 

 noticed two different houses, situated a few rods distant, connected by a well 

 beaten path, along which ants were passing back and forth, from one house 

 to the other, in the greatest harmony ; but one of these may have been a colony 

 founded by the other. 



Once we noticed two of these ants, which probably belonged to different 

 houses, combating in an ant-path, along which a few ants were passing to and 

 fro. Occasionally one of these would stop a moment, look at the contest and 

 pass on. The struggle was obstinate and long. We became tired of the si-ht 

 and, after considerable trouble, succeeded in parting them, both being quite 

 lame. One we put far away, and left the other walking slowly around in 

 search of his enemy, when, on reaching the path, he seized the first ant he met 

 and the fight was more animated than ever, one of the parties being robust 

 and untired. Suddenly they stopped, looked a moment, and then began 

 caressing each other, soon after which they started side by side for their 

 town, not far distant. It seemed as if the first fighter, blinded by rage had 

 lastly fought his own brother. We have been stung several times by them 

 and think the pain about equal to that caused by the sting of the honey-bee!

to terminate in the porous substance of the corallum, between the cells, with- 

 out directly connecting them. 



This small group of corals appears to be more nearly related to Cyathoceris, 

 of Edwards and Haime, than to any other genus, either recent or fossil, with 

 which we are acquainted. It differs, however, in having the outer walls per- 

 forated, and in being destitute of distinct rays, as well as in the peculiar 

 wedge-like form of the base of the corallum, which is also usually, if not 

 always, free instead of attached. We regard the first of the following species 

 as the type of the genus. 



Sphenopoterium obtcsum. Corallum short,abruptcuneiform,wider than high; 

 base carinate, nearly straight, or very slightly sinuous in the middle ; sides 

 expanding rapidly upwards from the keel. Cells from four to about nine, 

 compai'atively large, generally rather deep, conical, and where not more than 

 four or five, rounded, and separated by thick interstices, but becoming angular, 

 with thin intervening partitions, where more crowded. Surface stria? fine, 

 and showing a tendency to converge towards the middle of the base, often 

 anastomosing, so as to form a kind of shagreen-like style of ornament. 



Length or height of a large specimens with nine cells, inch ; breadth, 



inch ; thickness, inch; diameter of one of the cells, 0-29 inch. 



Locality and position. 



Sphenopoterium compressum. Corallum compressed,wider than high, carinate 

 on each lateral margin, and apparently retaining a scar of attachment at the 

 middle of the base ; sides sulcate betweeen the cells, widening rapidly upwards 

 on the edges, and very gradually on the sides. Cells three or more, com- 

 paratively large, rather deep, rounded, with thin walls ; arranged in a row 

 parallel to the longer transverse diameter of the corallum. Surface finely 

 shagreened by the anastomosing of the striae. 



Length or height, 0-57 inch ; breadth, 0-93 inch ; thickness, 0-35 inch ; 

 diameter of cells, 0-26 inch. 



It is possible this may be a variety of the preceding species, though its com- 

 pressed form, thinner walls, and lateral carina?., give it quite a different aspect. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Sphenopoterium enorme. Corallum small, subglobose, obtusely subturbi- 

 nate ; rounded, and apparently retaining some remains of a scar of attach- 

 ment at the base. Cells four or more, rather irregularly disposed, circular, 

 and moderately deep. Surface slightly more coarsely marked than the last, 

 but otherwise similar. 



Height, 0-45 inch ; transverse diameter about 0-43 inch ; breadth of cells, 

 about 0-18 inch. 



Locality and position. Rockford, Indiana, from beds probably of upper De- 

 vonian age, but containing Carboniferous Goniatites. 



Sphenopoterium cuneatum. Corallum compressed, cuneate, longer than wide, 

 base sharp, a little rounded on the lateral edges. Cells from two or three, to 

 five or six, rather deep, arranged alternately on each lateral edge, and directed 

 obliquely outward and upward ; rounded or somewhat oval at the aperture, and 

 more or less compressed towards the base ; sometimes having one or two 

 slightly prominent ridges extending part of the way up the sides ; punctae of 

 the walls numerous and distinct. Surface striae fine, closely arranged, rather 

 regular, and minutely crenulate, directed obliquely inward and downward 

 from the cells, and passing more or less nearly parallel to each other to the 

 base, on the lower flattened half. 



Length, 0-75 inch; breadth, 0-43 inch; thickness, 0-21 inch; diameter of 

 cells, about 0-15 inch.

ECHINODERMATA. 

 ASTERIDJE. 



Genus PALASTERINA, McCoy. 



Subgenus Schoenaster. 



The specimens of the beautiful star-fish, upon which we propose to found, 

 this subgenus, are unfortunately not in a condition to enable us to work out 

 fully the details of its structure. As far as can be determined, however, it 

 agrees in most of its characters with Palasterina, though it differs from the 

 typical species of that genus {Uraster primcevus, Forbes) in having the adam- 

 bulacral plates arranged with their longer diameter directed obliquely out- 

 ward, instead of at right angles to that of the rays. This oblique arrange- 

 ment, or lateral imbrication of these pieces, gives to each range, as seen from 

 below, a peculiar twisted or rope-like appearance, which suggested the name 

 Schoenaster (o-%oivis a rope, aVi-wg, a star.) 



Although we place it for the present as a subgenus under Palasterina, we 

 think it more than probable that when better specimens can be examined, it 

 will be found to present other differences of sufficient importance to entitle it 

 to rank as a distinct genus, in which case it can retain as a generic name that 

 by which we have designated it as a subgenus. 



Palasterina (Schoenaster) fimbriata. Body depressed, pentagonal, the 

 angles being extended into narrow, acutely pointed rays or arms, which are 

 convex above, and about equal in length to the diameter of the disk. Upper 

 side of the disk and arms composed of small, solid, convex, or somewhat 

 tumid plates. Ambulacral furrows deep, rather narrow, and bounded on each 

 side by the single row of oblique adambulacral pieces, which also form the 

 sides of the arms, beyond the disk, where some six or seven of these pieces 

 occupy a space of 0-35 inch. Disk apparently not provided with a regular 

 range of marginal pieces ; concave in outline between the rays, where it is, 

 like the sides of the arms, fringed by a single range of short, lanceolate spines. 



The plates forming the upper side of the rays near the disk, are hexagonal, 

 pentagonal, or irregular in form, and consist of about five or six ranges be- 

 tween the marginal rows, with a few much smaller intercalated pieces. 

 Farther out they gradually pass into two mesial ranges of oblong, alternating 

 pieces, arranged with their longer diameter parallel to that of the ray ; and 

 two series of much smaller, pentagonal or hexagonal alternating plates on 

 each side, between the middle ranges and the adambulacral rows. Towards 

 the extremities of the rays, these two ranges of small pieces on each side 

 diminish in size, and at last become obsolete, leaving only the adambulacral 

 and middle ranges. 



None of the specimens are in a condition to show the form and arrange- 

 ment of the plates forming the disk, nor the position of the vent and madre- 

 poriform plate. Near the extremities of the arms the dorsal pores, which are 

 comparatively small, pass chiefly between the ends of the oblong plates, form- 

 ing the two mesial ranges ; but farther in, towards the disk, they seem to be 

 somewhat irregularly distributed. There appear to be five bilobate, oral 

 pieces, but we suspect each of these is divided by a close fitting suture, so as 

 to make ten in the entire series. 



Greater diameter, 2-37 inches ; lesser do., 0-89 inch ; breadth of ambulacra] 

 furrows, about 0-10 inch ; length of marginal spines, 0-07 inch.

Chonetes planumbona. Shell of medium size, nearly semicircular ; length 

 from two-thirds to three-fourths the breadth ; hinge line about equalling the 

 greatest breadth ; front rounded, or forming with the sides a nearly semi- 

 circular curve ; lateral margins intersecting the hinge at right-angles, or 

 sometimes very slightly sinuous near the ears. Ventral valve gibbous, most 

 convex in the middle, and flattened at the umbo, destitute of any traces of a 

 mesial sinus ; ears a little compressed ; cardinal margin sloping slightly from 

 the beak, on each side of which it is armed with five or six spines ; area of 

 moderate breadth ; foramen broad, triangular, the upper angle being rounded. 

 Dorsal valve concave, or following nearly the curve of the other valve ; cardinal 

 process moderately prominent, nearly or quite closing the foramen of the 

 opposite valve ; interior without a prominent mesial ridge, rather distinctly 

 granulose, the granules being arranged in radiating lines ; visceral scar rather 

 large ; impressions of aductor muscles small and deep. Surface of both valves 

 apparently smooth or only marked by obscure undulations of growth, but 

 showing under a lens nearly obsolete traces of depressed rounded radiating 

 striae, crossed by minute concentric lines or wrinkles.

 equalling the greatest breadth ; anterior side regularly rounded ; sides 

 intersecting the hinge nearly at right-angles. Ventral valve gibbous, without 

 any traces of a mesial sinus ; ears triangular, convex, and moderately distinct 

 from the swell of the visceral region ; umbo convex, incurved, and apparently 

 extending slightly beyond the hinge line. Surface ornamented by compara- 

 tively large, rounded, radiating costse, which more than equal the depressions 

 between, on the convex part of the valve, but decrease in size, and become 

 more numerous by division, and the implantation of others between, around 

 the anterior slope ; crossed by numerous very fine concentric striae, only visible 

 under a lens. The visceral region is also marked by moderately distinct 

 rather regular wrinkles, while the bases of a few scattering spines are seen 

 on the anterior slope. (Dorsal valve unknown.) 



Length 0-37 inch ; breadth 0-45 inch ; convexity 0*25 inch. 



Locality and position. Jefferson County, Iowa. Lower Coal measures. 



Peoductus paevus. Shell rather small, nearly hemispherical, without any 

 traces of a mesial sinus ; length and breadth nearly equal ; hinge about 

 equalling the greatest breadth ; front rounded ; sides sometimes slightly 

 sinuous near the ears. Ventral valve gibbous, regularly arched, not depressed 

 in the visceral region ; beak incurved a little beyond the hinge ; ears small, 

 convex, nearly rectangular at the extremities of the hinge, moderately distinct 

 from the swell of the umbo. Dorsal valve deeply concave, particularly in 

 the middle and towards the beak. Surface of both valves ornamented by 

 numerous small, rounded, rather closely arranged, occasionally bifurcating 

 strise, about six of which may be counted in the space of one-tenth of an inch. 

 Spines erect, apparently confined to the ventral valve, each ear of which 

 supports some seven or eight, while there are usually about three times that 

 number scattered around the anterior and lateral slopes. Sometimes very

obscure traces of small concentric wrinkles are indistinctly visible near the 

 beak and on the ears, particularly of the ventral valve. 



Length 0-59 inch ; breadth 0-60 inch ; convexity of ventral valve 0*34 inch. 



This shell might be mistaken for an imperfect specimen of P. fasciculatus of 

 McChesney, from which species it differs, however, in having finer striae, a 

 more deeply concave dorsal valve, and in being always destitute of a mesial 

 sinus in the ventral valve. When good specimens of these species can be 

 compared they may be distinguished at a glance, by the more extended 

 anterior, and the fasciculate character of the striae upon that part of the shell in 

 P. fasciculatus.

 anterior side rounded, or sometimes a little flattened; sides rounding to the 

 front, and somewhat contracted near the ears. Ventral valve gibbous, rather 

 strongly arched, moderately pro luced, ani presenting scarcely any indications 

 of a sinus ; ears triangular, convex, or somewhat vaulted, and separated from 

 the swell of the umbo and the prominent visceral region, by a rather

Aviculopecten Burlingtonensis. Shell of about medium size, very thin and 

 fragile, suborbicular, slightly wider than long, broadly and regularly rounded 

 on the ventral margin, more narrowly rounded near the middle on each side, 

 thence sloping towards the beak at an angle of about 100 ; hinge straight,

 numerous very regular, undulating, and distinctly imbricating, concentric- 

 laminae of growth, which become closely arranged, and sharply elevated 

 on the ears, where the radiating ribs are not developed. (Right valve

In the shortness of its ears, the deep sinus in the anterior edge of its right 

 valve, and its surface markings, this species seems to bear close relations to 

 the typical forms of the genus Monotis, but it wants the cartilage-pit under 

 the beak, said to be characteristic of that genus, while its geological position 

 is far below the range of any of the known species of Monotis.

 entire turn at the extreme point, which is directed obliquely forward ; surface 

 marked by distinct lines, and imbricating lamina? of growth, which are quite 

 prominent on the anterior side, and near the cardinal margin of the left valve, 

 but more obscure on all parts of the other. 



The ligament area is comparatively narrow, and marked by longi- 

 tudinal furrows ; immediately under the beak the anterior margin is thickened ,

Schizodus Chesterensis. Shell rather large, transversely ovate, convex 

 in the anterior and umbonal regions, and cuneate posteriorly. Anterior 

 side regularly rounded ; base forming a broad, irregular, semiovate curve, 

 being usually slightly more prominent a little behind the middle than

 extremity ; posterior side contracted, considerably longer than the other, and 

 abruptly rounded or subangular at the termination, the most salient part 

 being rather above the middle ; dorsal margin nearly straight and declining 

 gradually behind the beaks, from which it rounds regularly into the anterior 

 margin in front. Beaks gibbous, rather elevated, incurved, and located less

Genus CARDIOMORPHA, Koninck. 



C ardiomorph a radiata. Shell subcircular, gibbous in the central and umbonal 

 regions, base more narrowly rounded than the front or anal margin ; cardinal 

 border a little arched ; beaks gibbous, abruptly pointed, incurved and showing 

 a tendency to curve forward at the immediate points, depressed or rising 

 but little above the hinge margin ; surface ornamented by numerous fine, 

 regular, radiating, rather rounded striae, about equalling the depressions 

 between. (Hinge and interior unknown.) 



Allied to C. ovata of Hall, (Rept. Survey Iowa, pi. 7, fig. 10), from near the 

 same horizon, but more rounded in outline, and has much less elevated 

 and less curved beaks. Both these species differ from the typical forms of Cardio- 

 ?norpha, Koninck, in having radiating strife, and may prove to be generically 

 distinct when specimens showing the hinge and interior are obtained. 



Length 0-95 inch ; height 1 inch ; breadth or convexity 0'77 inch. 



Locality and position. Rockford, Indiana. From beds containing Carbon- 

 iferous species of Goniatites, but generally supposed to be of Upper Divonian

GASTEROPODA. 



Genus BELLEROPHON, Montfort. 



Bellerophon crassds. Shell large, very thick, subglobose, or a little longer 

 than wide ; volutions expanding somewhat rapidly, rounded over the dorsum 

 and sides ; umbilical region excavated, but not perforate ; mesial band narrow, 

 rather prominent, and margined on each side by a raised line ; aperture 

 transverse, reniform, or sublunate ; lip strongly thickened near the umbilical 

 excavations on each side, but not covering them, thinner and but slightly 

 prominent on either side of the narrow sinus in its outer margin, and spreading 

 in the form of a moderately thick, smooth, callus, over the inner whorls 

 within the aperture, and between the callosities on each side ; surface marked 

 by rather distinct irregular wrinkles, and lines of growth, the former of which 

 are strongest on each side near the lip. 



Greatest length 2-20 inches ; breadth at the aperture 2 inches ; breadth of 

 the mesial band near the aperture 0'12 inch. 



Locality and position. Pittsburg, St. Claire County, Illinois. Lower part

Genus PLEUROTOMARIA, Defrance. 





Pleurotomaria subconstricta. Shell small, conical subovate, longer than 

 wide ; spire moderately elevated, rather pointed at the apex. Volutions five 

 and a-haif to six, obliquely flattened or concave above, excepting near the 

 suture, where there is a subangular prominence occupied by a series of small 

 nodes or granules ; those of the spire having a second angle a little below 

 the middle. Body whorl forming rather more than half the entire length, 

 biangular around the middle, the lower angle being less prominent and more 

 obtuse than the other, and not exposed on the spire ; vertically flattened or 

 a little concave on the outer side, and convex below. Suture linear, but 

 occupying a rather distinct rounded constriction or depression. Aperture 

 broad subovate, approaching a rhombic subquadrate outline ; columella not 

 distinctly perforate. Surface ornamented by about fifteen revolving lines, 

 some ten or twelve of which occupy the under side of the body whorl, where 

 they are larger than on any other part of the shell ; crossing these there are 

 very fine transverse strife, which are closely arranged on the upper slope of 

 the whorls, particularly in crossing the spiral band, but on reaching the lower 

 angle of the body whorl, they become stronger, so as to give it a crenulated 

 appearance. Spiral band narrow, fiat and located just above the middle angle 

 of the body volution.

 gradually in size, compressed convex, last one prominently rounded or 

 subangular around the middle ; suture well defined ; aperture subcircular ; 

 spiral band not very distinctly defined, located near the middle of the body 

 whorl and passing around just above the suture on the outer turns ; columella 

 imperforate. Surface ornamented by about twelve or thirteen comparatively 

 distinct revolving lines, eight of which occupy that portion of the body whorl 

 below the band, where they are a little smaller and more closely arranged 

 than above. 



On the upper slope of the whorls above the band, the three or four revolving 

 lines occupying that part of the shell are crossed obliquely by distinct 

 transverse lines, which are so much stronger on the revolving strife than 

 between them, that they present the appearance of small nodes or granules, 

 at the points of crossing. One of the revolving lines, which is larger than the 

 others, passes around on the middle of the revolving band, and is neatly and 

 regularly crenulated by the crossing of the transverse lines.

 suture distinct ; spiral band very narrow, concave, located a little above the 

 middle of the body whorl, and passing around rather below the middle of the 

 others ; aperture subcircular ; umbilical region indented, but apparently not 

 distinctly perforate. Surface ornamented by about eighteen to twenty rather 

 distinct revolving lines, only two or three of which occupy the flattened or 

 concave upper slope above the band, where they are less prominent than the

 volutions six to six and a-half, slightly convex, increasing gradually in size, 

 those of the spire more or less distinctly angular around the middle, last one 

 sometimes slightly flattened near the middle just below the angle, and convex 

 on the under side ; suture well defined. Spiral band of moderate breadth, 

 not very distinctly defined, sometimes slightly concave, occupying the more 

 or less compressed middle portion of the last whorl, and passing around so as 

 to bring its lower margin a little above the suture on the other turns. 

 Aperture subcircular; columella arcuate, a little flattened below, and imper- 

 forate ; outer lip thin ; sinus narrow and deep. Surface marked by about 

 eighteen to twenty very small, obscure revolving striae, some twelve or thirteen

 six, convex, last one, in mature shells, sometimes obliquely flattened a little 

 above, just below the suture, thence rounded below; suture linear, but occupying 

 a more or less deeply rounded depression ; spiral band not well defined,

 slight flattening of its upper side, and passing around the middle of the upper 

 turns ; sinus of the lip, judging from the curve of the lines of growth in crossing 

 the band, shallow, and not very clearly defined ; aperture subcircular; columella 

 indented in the umbilical region, but not distinctly perforate. Surface 

 ornamented by about fourteen to eighteen distinct revolving lines, three of 

 which, on the middle of the last turn, are larger than those above, while those 

 below gradually diminish in size toward the umbilical pit ; only two or three 

 of the smaller lines usually occupy the slightly depressed upper part of the

Pleurotomaria Chesterensis. Shell of medium size, turbinate ; spire 

 moderately elevated ; volutions about six, increasing rather gradually in size, 

 convex, distinctly carinated around the middle, and flattened, or a little concave 

 above and below the carina, the flattened space above being oblique, and that 

 below vertical ; last whorl provided with a second carina below the other, and 

 a little convex on the under side ; suture linear ; umbilicus small, or nearly 

 closed ; surface marked by numerous fine, regular, thread-like revolving lines, 

 crossed by similar striae, which, in traversing the spiral band, which occupies 

 the space on the middle of the body whorl between the two carinas, make a 

 gentle backward curve, parallel to the border of the rather shallow sinus of 

 the outer lip ; aperture subcircular, approaching a subquadrate outline. 



Length 0-75 inch ; breadth 0-72 inch ; apical angle regular, divergence about 

 60; breadth of spiral band 0-14 inch. 



Similar in form and general appearance to P. tabulata, Conrad, but differs 

 in having a small umbilicus, while the axis of that shell is not perforate. It 

 also differs in having a much broader spiral band, which occupies the space 

 between the two carinae, instead of coinciding with the upper angle. Again 

 the upper carina of the shell under consideration is never crenulated, as in 

 Conrad's species. 



Locality and position. Chester, Illinois. Chester Limestone of the Lower 

 Carboniferous series. 



Pleurotomaria subscalaris. Shell large, rather thick, conical ovate ; spire 

 moderately elevated ; volutions six, those near the summit of the spire flattened, 

 the others convex, and provided with a distinct, sharp carina, which occupies 

 a position a little above the middle of the body whorl, passes around near the 

 middle of the second, becomes lower on the third, and sinks below the suture 

 on the others. Below this angle there is on the body volution, a second less 

 distinct subangular prominence, with a broad, vertical, nearly flattened, or 

 slightly concave space between the two. Under side of last turn a little convex, 

 and the umbilical region somewhat indented, but not perforate ; suture well 

 defined. Spiral band narrow, and occupying the principal angle of the whorls. 



The surface of our specimen is somewhat eroded, but it retains traces of 

 about twenty rather strong revolving lines, eight or nine of which occupy the 

 upper side of the whorls, above the carina, some three or four the flattened

rater side of the body whorl, and the remainder the under side. On the upper 

 sloping surface of the whorls there are also regularly arranged, oblique 

 transverse stride, which, in well-preserved specimens, are probably continued 

 upon the outer and under sides of the last turn. 



Agrees with P. tabulata, Conrad, in size and general appearance, but differs 

 in having the upper whorls of the spire more depressed, and without any angle 

 visible above the suture. The principal angle on its lower whorls also appears 

 to be destitute of the crenulation, so distinct on that of P. tabulata. 



Length 1-67 inch; breadth 1-52 inch; apical angle convex, divergence 70. 



Locality and position. Macoupen County, Illinois. Lower Coal Measures. 



Pleurotomaria speciosa. Shell attaining a medium size ; spire moderately 

 elevated ; volutions seven to seven and a-half, sub angular just below the suture, 

 thence obliquely flattened to a much more distinct revolving angle a little below 

 the middle of the upper turns, and about the middle of the body whorl. Below 

 this second angle the outer side of the last turn is vertically flattened or a little 

 concave, so as to produce a third obtuse revolving prominence below the 

 middle, beneath which the under side of the whorl is convex. Suture well 

 defined. Spiral band narrow, very prominent, angular and regularly crenu- 

 lated by cross lines, occupying and partly forming the middle angle of the 

 body whorl, which passes around on the upper whorls a little more than 

 one-third of their breadth above the suture. Aperture subcircular, approaching 

 subpentagonal ; umbilicus small. Surface ornamented by eighteen to twenty- 

 two thread-like revolving lines, about twelve of which occupy the under side 

 of the body whorl, four to seven the upper slope, and two or three the outer 

 flattened space. Crossing all these there are numerous extremely fine, very 

 regular, closely arranged transverse lines, about every fourth or fifth one of 

 which is considerably enlarged near the suture ; and they all curve obliquely 

 backwards in approaching the spiral band. 



Length about 0-55 inch ; breadth 0-51 inch; apical angle regular, divergence 

 82; breadth of spiral band not more than about 0-03 inch.

 breadth nearly equal; spire conical, moderately elevated; volutions about five 

 and a half to six, flat, last one distinctly angular around the outer side, and 

 flattened or slightly convex below; umbilical region somewhat excavated, but 

 not perforate; spiral band extremely narrow, grooved, occupying the angle 

 around the outer side of the body whorl, and passing around scarcely above 

 the suture on the other volutions, margined above and below by a sharply 

 elevated line; suture linear, but well defined, having a somewhat banded 

 appearance, in consequence of the development of a rather distinct revolving line 

 at the upper margin of each whorl; aperture apparently rhombic subquadrate. 

 Surface ornamented by about twenty obscure, closely arranged, revolving striae, 

 crossed by stronger, very regular transverse lines, which are most distinct on 

 the upper part of the whorls, and pass with a gentle curve obliquely 

 backwards and outwards to the spiral band. Below the angle the body 

 whorl is nearly smooth, or only marked by very obscure lines of growth, and 

 faint traces of revolving striae. 



Length about 0-93 inch; breadth nearly 0-97 inch; apical angle regular, 

 divergence 64. 



Locality and position. Lasalle, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



Pleurotomaria scitula. Shell small, trochiform, length and breadth nearly 

 equal; spire depressed conical; volutions six, a little convex, last one prominent 

 and narrowly rounded or subangular on the periphery, slightly convex below; 

 suture somewhat channelled ; aperture subcircular, approaching a subquadrate 

 form; umbilical region impressed, but not distinctly perforate; spiral band

rather narrow, concave, and located above the narrowly rounded periphery of 

 the body whorl, passing around rather below the middle of the other volutions. 

 Surface ornamented by from about seventeen to twenty-two revolving lines, 

 only three or four of which occupy that part of the body whorl above the 

 band, where they are larger and more widely separated than below; distinct, 

 but much smaller, regularly arranged, thread-like lines mark the volutions 

 transversely. 



Length and breadth each about 0-22 inch; apical angle convex, divergence 79. 



Locality and position. Hodges Creek, Macoupen County, Illinois. Coal 

 Measures. 



Pleurotomaria Shumardi. Shell trochiform, of medium size, very thin ; spire 

 moderately elevated, conical, pointed at the apex. Volutions about six, 

 increasing rather rapidly in size, obliquely flattened above ; those of the spire 

 being somewhat angular near the lower side; last one very prominent, and 

 angular around the middle, the immediate edge of the angle being terminated 

 by the narrow spiral band, convex below. Band slightly concave, and 

 margined above and below by a small line or indistinct angle, the lower one 

 of which scarcely rises above the suture on the upper whorls. Suture well 

 defined. Umbilicus small, or nearly closed. Aperture rhombic subquad- 

 rangular, wider than high. Surface ornamented by numerous transverse lines, 

 which are very regular and closely arranged on the upper whorls, but become 

 stronger, more distinct, and less regular on the last turn. In crossing the 

 upper flattened sloping sides of the whorls, these lines arch a little forward, 

 and pass very obliquely backwards from the suture to the band; on the under 

 side of the body whorl they are small, nearly obsolete, and crossed by obscure 

 traces of fine revolving strife.

Genus STRAP AROLLUS, Montfort?=ETJOMPHALUS, Sowerby. 



Euomphalus planodorsatus. Shell of medium size, subdiscoidal, spire nearly 

 fiat, or but slightly elevated above the body whorl. Volutions about five, 

 increasing gradually in size from within, flat above, and provided with a 

 moderately distinct revolving angle about two-thirds of the distance across 

 from the inside; from this angle the outer whorl is rounded over the periphery 

 to about the middle of the under side, where there is another angle, from 

 which it rounds into the umbilicus ; suture well defined. Umbilicus large, 

 deep and showing about one-half of each inner whorl ; aperture subcircular. 

 (Surface unknown.) Height about 0-30 inch ; breadth 1 inch. 



Allied to E. pentangulatus, Sowerby, but differs in having the angle on the 

 upper side of the whorls located nearer the outer margin, and the periphery or 

 outer side of its volutions more broadly rounded. 



Locality and position. Thompson's quarry, Randolph County, Illinois. Chester 

 Limestone, of Lower Carboniferous series. 



Euomphalus umbilicatus. Shell of medium size, depressed subtrochiform ; 

 spire rather elevated for a species of this genus. Volutions five to five and 

 a-half, convex, increasing gradually in size, nearly horizontally flattened on 

 the upper side, about half-way across from the suture, where there is a 

 rather distinct revolving angle, below this angle the upper oblique outer 

 slope is slightly flattened to near the middle of the outer side, which, in the 

 last whorl, is narrowly rounded ; under side of body volution rounded to a 

 moderately distinct angle near the middle, thence rounding into the umbilicus. 

 Suture well defined. Umbilicus large, or nearly twice as wide as the diameter

Genus NATICOPSIS, McCoy. 



Naticopsis nodosus. Shell obliquely subrhomboidal, rather thick; spire 

 depressed; volutions four and a-half, convex, increasing rapidly in size, last 

 one large, gibbous, oblique, and composing three-fourths of the entire length, 

 round on the outer side, and having shallow revolving depressions near the 

 suture above; suture moderately distinct; aperture subovate; lip sharp; 

 columella distinctly flattened, somewhat callous, not perforated. Surface 

 ornamented by numerous, nearly round, distinct nodes, which are arranged in 

 oblique rows, parallel to the lines of growth near the aperture of the last 

 turn, but become more crowded, and show a tendency to assume a quincunx 

 arrangement on other parts of the shell; lines of growth fine, rather regular 

 and scarcely deflected from their course by the presence of the nodes. 



Length, measuring from the most extended part of the aperture below, 

 obliquely to the apex of the spire, 1 inch; breadth 0-52 inch; apical angle 

 convex, divergence about 96. 



Locality and position. St. Clair County, Illinois. Lower Coal Measures. 



Naticopsis Hollidayi. Shell obliquely oblong-oval, thick and solid ; spire 

 depressed subcorneal, pointed at the immediate apex; volutions four to four 

 and a-half, convex, excepting just below the suture, where there is a shallow 

 revolving depression, rapidly enlarging, the last one forming more than 

 two-thirds the entire length;, suture linear; aperture ovate around the margin, 

 but contracted by the broad columella so as to be nearly semicircular within; 

 columella distinctly flattened, broad, and marked along its sharp, nearly 

 straight inner margin, by a well defined opercular impression. Surface 

 ornamented by very fine regular lines of growth, and numerous small nodes, 

 arranged in oblique rows ; the larger nodes on the last half and upper part of 

 the body whorl being more or less elongated in the direction of the lines of 

 growth. 



Length 1-15 inches; breadth 1-20 inches; apical angle nearly regular, 

 divergence 107. Named in honor of Mr. George H. Holliday, of Carinville, 

 Macoupen County, Illinois, to whom we are indebted for the specimens 

 described.

Genus PLATYOSTOMA, Conrad. 



Platyostoma nana. Shell quite small, subglobose, wider than high; spire 

 much depressed; volutions three, increasing very rapidly in size, last 

 one large and ventricose; suture rather deeply defined; aperture large, 

 broad obovate, straight on the inner side, equalling nearly seven-eighths of 

 the entire length of the shell; surface marked by fine lines of growth, which 

 become stronger, and very regular near the suture on the upper side of the 

 whorls. 



Length 0-19 inch; breadth 0-21 inch; length of aperture 0-15 inch, breadth 

 of do. 0-11 inch; apical angle about 123.

than wide; spire much depressed, or nearly flat; volutions four to four and 

 a-half, convex, increasing rapidly in size, last one large, or forming about 

 eight-ninths of the entire length, prominent and narrowly rounded above, 

 contracted and extended below; suture well defined; aperture large, longer 

 than wide, obovate, the inner side being nearly straight; columella not 

 perforate; surface (of an exfoliated specimen) retaining traces of rather strong 

 revolving lines. 



Length 1-21 inches; breadth 1-17 inches; length of aperture 1-05 inches; 

 breadth of do. 0-63 inch; apical angle regular, divergence 132. 



It is only provisionally we have placed this species in the genus Plaiyostoma; 

 the only specimen yet obtained being merely a cast retaining portions of the 

 shell, but not giving a clear idea of its generic characters. It differs from the typi- 

 cal species of that genus in having revolving lines, and will probably be found to 

 present other differences. When better specimens can be examined, we suspect 

 it will prove to belong to an undescribed genus, though we have not the means 

 of settling the question at present. If a new genus is established for its reception, 

 a shell figured by Murchison, De Verneuil and Keyserling (Geol. Russia, pi. 23, 

 fig. 14), as an undetermined species of lanthina, (= Scalites Verneuilii, of 

 D'Orbigny), should probably be placed in the same group. 



Locality and position. Grayville, Illinois. Coal Measures. 



Genus EUNEMA,. Salter. 



Eunema? Salteri. Shell elongate conical, turreted, acute at the apex. Volu- 

 tions thirteen, slightly convex, increasing very gradually in size, ornamented 

 by two small revolving carina? a little below the suture, the lower one of which 

 is larger than the other; last whorl having a third angle near the middle, 

 which passes around just above the suture on the other volutions ; below 

 this third angle there is on the under side of the last turn a fourth nearly 

 obsolete revolving prominence. Suture linear. Apertuce ovate, a little oblique. 

 Columella arcuate, not perforate. Lines of growth fine, rather obscure, and 

 passing straight across the whorls. 



Length 0-50 inch; breadth 0-17 inch. Length of aperture 0-17 inch; breadth 

 0-10 inch. Apical angle convex, divergence 20. 



This beautiful little shell differs from the typical species of the genus in 

 which we have provisionally placed it, in having the lines of growth straight 

 instead of sinuous. This character, and the revolving carinas, would also 

 separate it from Loxonema, to which we were at first inclined to refer it. On 

 a hasty examination it might be referred to the genus Murckisonia, some species 

 of which it nearly resembles in its general appearance ; a careful examination, 

 however, has satisfied us that its lines of growth do not make the slightest 

 curve, so as to indicate the existence of a sinus in any part of the lip. We 

 suspect it may belong to an undescribed genus; though, if it were from a more 

 modern formation, we should scarcely hesitate to place it in the genus Turritella. 



Named in honor of Mr. J. W. Salter, the distinguished Palaeontologist of the 

 British Geological Survey. 



Locality and position. Springfield, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



Genus LOXONEMA, Phillips. 



We doubt the propriety of referring such forms as are here described, to the 

 recent genus Turbonilla, (Chemnitzia, D'Orbigny,) since they are generally 

 not only much larger shells, but differ in not having, so far as we have been 

 able to see, the apex of the spire reversed, as in the species upon which the 

 genus Turbonilla was founded. We therefore agree with those who prefer to 

 retain Phillips' name, Loxonema, for these older fossil species. 



Loxonema scitula. Shell small, elongate, conical ; spire elevated and regu- 

 larly tapering ; volutions eight to eight and a half, very slightly convex, in- 

 creasing gradually in size, last one rounded and not produced below ; suture

moderately well defined ; aperture obliquely ovate, acutely angular above. 

 Surface ornamented by distinct, regularly disposed, straight vertical folds or 

 costae, about fourteen or fifteen of which occupy each turn ; folds equalling 

 the depressions between, and on the last turn becoming suddenly obsolete 

 below the middle ; no lines of growth visible.

Locality and position. Springfield, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



Loxonema rugosa. Shell small, elongate, conical ; volutions seven and a 

 half to eight, very slightly convex, increasing gradually in size, last one abruptly 

 rounded in the middle, not extended below ; suture rather slightly impressed ; 

 aperture ovate. Surface of each whorl ornamented by about eighteen to nine- 

 teen straight, distinct, vertical folds or costae, which equal the depressions 

 between, and are disposed so as to range in regular lines from the last whorl 

 to the summit of the spire ; those on the body whorl becoming abruptly obso- 

 lete below the middle. No lines of growth visible. 



Length, 044 inch ; breadth 0-18 inch ; length of aperture 0-12 inch ; breadth 

 of do., 0-08 inch. Apical angle convex above, divergence 25. 



Near the last, but differs in having the spire less attenuate above, and in 

 having more costae to each turn. The costas also differ in being ranged in 

 right lines, all the way up the spire, while those of the adjacent whorls, in the 

 last, alternate. This latter character gives quite a peculiar aspect to this 

 species. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Loxonema cerithiformis. Shell rather under medium size, elongate, conical; 

 spire elevated, gradually tapering to an acute point. Volutions, eleven to 

 twelve, convex, and increasing gradually in size ; last one not much enlarged, 

 somewhat prominently rounded below the middle. Suture well defined. 

 Aperture oval, subrhombic, a little longer than wide, apparently provided 

 with a small, rather oblique notch at the base of the columella ; outer lip thin, 

 broadly and deeply sinuous above and prominent below, so as to present a dis- 

 tinct inversely sigmoid outline ; columella arcuate. Surface nearly smooth, but 

 showing under a lens very fine, obscure lines of growth, which curve parallel 

 to the margin of the lip ; just below the suture these lines are gathered into a 

 series of minute, short, regularly arranged wrinkles or crenulations, scarcely 

 visible without the aid of a magnifier. 



Length, 0-70 inch ; breadth, 0-24 inch ; length of aperture, 0-18 inch ; breadth 

 of do., 0-11 inch. Apical angle regular, divergence 24. 



Appears to agree very nearly with Chemnitzia subconstricta of Koninck, in 

 form and surface markings ; but differs, in the form of the aperture, and in 

 having a small notch or sinus, with a slight projection of the lip, at the base 

 of the columella. 



Locality and position. Springfield, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



Loxonema inornata. Shell small, conical subovate ; spire moderately 

 elevated, pointed at the apex ; volutions seven, slightly convex, increasing

Eulima? peracuta. Shell comparatively large, elongate, conical; spire 

 much elevated, attenuate, very acutely pointed at the apex, and sometimes 

 subulate. Whorls about thirteen, nearly or quite flat, and increasing very 

 gradually in size ; last one forming a little more than one-third the entire 

 length, slightly prominent around the middle, somewhat extended below .; 

 suture moderately distinct, particularly between the lower whorls. Aperture 

 rather narrow, subovate, acutely angular above, and narrowly rounded below ; 

 outer lip thin and sharp ; inner lip very slightly thickened, and a little re- 

 flexed below ; columella arcuate or faintly sinuous. Surface polished, but 

 showing under a good lens extremely fine, very obscure lines of growth. 



Length, 1-67 inch; breadth, 0-54 inch; apical angle regular, divergence

Locality and position. Jacksburg, St. Clair county, Illinois. Lower Coal

Genus MACROCHEILUS, Phillips. 



Some confusion exists in regard to the limits of this genus, in consequence 

 of the fact that Prof. Phillips did not define it clearly, and unfortunately in- 

 cluded in it species belonging to several groups, without designating what 

 particular species he regarded as the type of his genus. Nearly all subsequent 

 authors, however, agree in referring to it those oval, or subglobose forms, with 

 a thickened inner lip, and a more or less developed fold on the columella, 

 such as M. primiyenious, (=Stylifer primiyenious, Conrad) ; while there are 

 many other more elongated species referred sometimes to this genus, and 

 sometimes to Loxonema, or to Chemnilzia. 



It seems to us it would be better to regard as typical of this genus, only 

 such species as have developed, in a greater or less degree, the fold and thicken- 

 ing of the inner lip, nearly or quite all of which, so far as our observations 

 go, are the shorter forms. The more slender, elongated species, with a com- 

 paratively small body whorl, somewhat extended below, and without any 

 thickening of the inner lip, should, we think, be placed in a separate section, 

 either of this genus, or of Loxonema, or constitute a distinct group from both. 



Macroceeilus medialis. Shell of medium size, rather thick, rhombic, oval ; 

 spire depressed conical, acutely pointed at the apex, forming near one-third 

 of the entire length. Whorls six to six and a half, convex, increasing some- 

 what rapidly in size ; last one large, but not ventricose, the widest part being 

 near the middle ; suture distinct. Aperture rather narrow, oval, acutely 

 angular above, and narrowly rounded below ; outer lip sharp, nearly straight, 

 or but slightly prominent in the middle. Columella a little sinuous about half 

 way up the aperture. Inner lip thickened to the top of the aperture, but not 

 provided with a distinct fold or prominence below, marked by small, regular, 

 obscure transverse striae or wrinkles above the middle. Surface apparently 

 smooth, but showing under a lens traces of fine, very obscure lines of growth.

New Genus SOLENISCUS.* 



The shell upon which we propose to found this genus, differs from the smooth 

 species usually referred to Loxoncma in having the body whorl contracted and 

 extended below into a distinct straight canal, with a well defined oblique plait 

 or fold rather low on the columella. In the last mentioned character, as well 

 as in its smooth surface, it agrees more nearly with the genus Macrocheilus. 

 but its fusiform outline, narrow aperture and distinct canal, are peculiarities 

 which separate it clearly from that group, as usually understood. In its 

 general appearance it resembles some species of Fasciolaria; but as it has only 

 one, instead of two or three folds on the columella, and is entirely destitute of 

 nodes, costse, or revolving marks, while its outer lip is quite smooth within. 

 there 'is little reason for supposing it to be really nearly related to that genus, 

 which is unknown below the upper Cretaceous. 



It is probable that when the aperture and columella of such species as 

 Macrocheilus lirnnceformis, McCoy, and Macrocheilus fusiformis, Hall, (non M. 

 fusiformis of Morris' Catalogue,) as well as of several of the smooth fusiform 

 species referred by others to Loxonema, are better known, they will be found 

 to possess the characters of this genus. 



Soleniscus typicus. Shell fusiform ; spire elevated, and acutely conical at 

 the apex; volutions seven to seven and a-half, flat or but slightly convex, 

 increasing rather gradually in size, last one comparatively large, slightly ventri- 

 cose in the middle, and contracted into a distinct, straight canal below ; suture 

 moderately well defined ; aperture very narrow, acutely angular above, and

 of very fine lines of growth,

CEPHALOPODA. 



Genus ORTHOCERAS, Breynius. 



Orthoceras expansum. Shell having the form of a moderately compressed, 

 rapidly tapering cone; section subcircular, near the smaller end, but more 

 oval towards the larger. Septa concave, and separated near the smaller end 

 by spaces between one-fourth and one-fifth their own greater diameter; the 

 intervals increasing somewhat, but not near in proportion to the expansion of 

 the shell above; siphuncle subcentral, small where it passes through the septa, 

 but swelling out into a globular cavity between. Surface apparently smooth. 



Length of an entirely septate specimen imperfect at both extremities, 4-29 

 inches; greater diameter at the smaller end 0-80 inch, smaller do. of same 

 about 0-71 inch; greater diameter at larger end apparently not less than 3-20 

 inches. 



This species is allied in form and general appearance to O. dilatatum, 

 DeKoninck, (An. Fos. p. 515, pi. 45, fig. 8, a, b, c), but differs in presenting an 

 oval instead of a circular section ; its siphuncle is also much more nearly 

 central than is represented in DeKoninck's figure 8, a and b, pi. 45, and differs 

 in its peculiarity of swelling out into globular cavities between the septa. Our 

 species seems likewise to differ in its surface markings, being nearly or quite 

 smooth : this, however, may be due, at least to some extent, to the exfoliation 

 of the outer layers of the shell. 



Locality and position. McDonough County, Illinois ; the specimen being found 

 loose, its exact geological position is unknown, though it is doubtless a 

 carboniferous species. 



Genus CYRTOCERAS, Goldfuss. 



Cyrtoceras curtum. Shell rather under medium size, slightly arched and 

 rapidly expanding; section oval, the transverse diameter being greater than 

 from the dorsal to the ventral side; lateral margins a little flattened; ventral 

 and dorsal sides very broadly rounded. Surface ornamented by numerous 

 small, regularly arranged annular striae, or impressed lines, which arch a little 

 forward in crossing the dorsum, where they are separated by spaces several 

 times their own breadth, excepting near the smaller extremity of the shell. 

 On the sides and ventrum, they become much more crowded, and more deeply 

 impressed. Septa rather deeply concave; siphuncle small, and placed about 

 half-way between the middle and the dorsal side. 



Length of a specimen imperfect at the smaller end, 1-25 inches; greater 

 diameter at the aperture about 1-24 inch, smaller do. 0-92 inch; greater 

 diameter at the smaller extremity 0-54 inch, smaller do. 0-45 inch. 



Locality and position. Graysville, Illinois. Coal Measures. 



Cyrtoceras? dilatatum. Shell broadly conical, very rapidly expanding, 

 thick, especially on one side, a little curved and apparently somewhat 

 compressed ; surface ornamented by numerous distinct, regularly arranged,

 inches from the smaller end, by spaces near one-twelfth of the greater diameter 

 of the shell at the same place; (siphuncle and aperture unknown). Length

Genus NAUTILUS, Breynius. 



Nautilus subglobosus. Shell under medium size, subglobose, broadly rounded 

 over the dorsum and sides; umbilicus (in casts) rather small, deep, conical, 

 or with nearly vertical sides, showing rather less than the half of each inner 

 whorl; volutions about three, increasing rapidly in size, especially in breadth, 

 deeply embracing, subangular on the sides around the umbilicus; septa rather 

 deeply concave, arching very slightly forward over the dorsal region, where 

 they are separated by spaces a little less than one-fifth their own greater 

 (transverse) diameter; aperture transversely sublunate, or subreniform; lip 

 deeply sinuous on the dorsal side; siphuncle central; surface apparently 

 smooth. Length 2-11 inches; height 1-72 inch; breadth at aperture 1-95 inch. 

 This species is related to the following, but differs in having a wider umbilicus, 

 with more rapidly expanding whorls. It is also more broadly rounded on the 

 dorsum, and its septa are rather more closely arranged in proportion to the 

 breadth of the whorls. 



Locality and position. Chester, Illinois. Chester Limestone of Lower Car-

Nautilus Chesterensis. Shell under medium size, subglobose, rounded

 vertical walls, probably almost closed in adult specimens retaining the shell,

*We retain Prof. King's name Discus, in a subgeneric sense, for all thediscoidal forms 

 with a central siphuncle, simple septa, and slender contiguous whorls, all exposed in a 

 wide, shallow umbilicus. It seems not to be quite synonymous with Disciles, of McCoy, 

 which is described as having the siphuncle " near the outer edge of the periphery." 

 We have some doubts whether such forms should be retained in the same genus with 

 the living species of Nautilus.

discoidal; umbilicus very wide, shallow, and showing nearly all of each 

 inner whorl; volutions about four, increasing gradually in size, slightly 

 embracing, nearly rounded in young shells, but becoming somewhat compressed 

 on the sides and dorsum, in mature individuals having a row of obscure nodes 

 around each dorso-lateral margin; aperture a little oval, its longer diameter 

 being in the direction of the plane of the shell: septa deeply concave, arching

Locality and position. Alpine, Iowa. Coal Measures. 



Nautilus (Discus) trisulcatus. Shell discoidal, under medium size; 

 umbilicus wide, moderately deep, and showing nearly all of each inner whorl ; 

 volutions slender, increasing very gradually in size, a little broader transversely 

 than the diameter from the dorsum to the ventral margin, ventricose and 

 rounded on each side, and provided with a deep rounded sulcus in each 

 dorso-lateral region. Between these two sulci, the dorsum is narrow, prominent 

 and less deeply grooved, the sulcus being bounded on either side by an angle. 

 Surface retaining traces of rather strong longitudinal lines. Septa deeply 

 concave, and arching distinctly backwards in each of the dorsal depressions, 

 separated on the dorsum by spaces generally less than one-third the transverse 

 diameter of the outer whorl at the place of measurement; siphuncle rather 

 small, and placed a little nearer the dorsal than the ventral side. Length (of

Locality and position. Rockford, Indiana, in beds containing Carboniferous 

 species of Goniatites, but usually regarded as Upper Devonian. 



Nautilus (Discus) digonus. Shell rather small, subdiscoidal; umbilicus 

 comparatively large, moderately deep, and showing all of each inner whorl ; 

 volutions about three or four, in contact, but not embracing, increasing 

 gradually in size, broad and nearly flat on the dorsal side, which is marked 

 by two very obscure longitudinal depressions near the aperture; distinctly 

 angular on each dorso-lateral margin, thence rounding regularly into the 

 umbilicus; surface of cast retaining traces of regular, equidistant longitudinal 

 lines, and much finer and more closely arranged transverse stria?; aperture and 

 section of the whorls nearly semicircular, the outer or dorsal side being almost 

 straight, and the inner rounded. Septa distinctly concave; their margins 

 curving obliquely backwards on the sides of the whorls, from the dorso-lateral 

 angles, and deflected backwards in crossing the dorsum. Siphuncle small, 

 located about one-third the diameter of each septum from the dorsal side.

 which is non-septate,) 1-20 inch; height 1 inch; breadth across the dorsum 

 of the outer whorl near the aperture, 0-62 inch; diameter of same from the 

 dorsal to the ventral side, 0-40 inch. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Nautilus (Discus) Sangamoneksis. Of this species we have seen but a 

 single specimen consisting of about half of one volution. It is a little wider 

 transversely than deep, and increases gradually in size from the smaller to the 

 larger end, being evidently part of a discoidal shell, with an umbilicus 

 about equalling the transverse diameter of the outer whorl. On the dorsum 

 , it is nearly flat, or but slightly convex, and the sides are a little concave. The 

 ventro-lateral regions are obliquely flattened, so as to form an abrupt slope 

 into the umbilicus, leaving a subangular prominence between the umbilicus 

 and each slightly concave side. The ventrum is moderately concave along the 

 middle, for the reception of the inner whorls, each of which was probably 

 about one-third hidden. 



[Oct. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 471 



On each dorso-lateral angle, there is a series of rather low nodes, about 

 twenty to twenty-two of which probably existed on each side of the entire 

 whorl. The transverse section of the whorls has a nearly quadrangular form, 

 if we regard the small ventral concavity, and the two sloping ventro-lateral 

 margins together as one side. The septa are moderately concave, and arch 

 gracefully backward on each side, while in crossing the dorsum they arch 

 less deeply in the same direction. The siphuncle is small, and located a little 

 nearer the dorsal than the ventral side. (Aperture and surface markings 

 unknown). 



Length, as inferred from the curve, about 2 inches; height about L45 inch ; 

 breadth near the aperture 0-88 inch.

Note. In the last number of the Proceedings of the Academy, we described 

 a new Echinoderm, under the name of Melonites Dance, mentioning, at the same 

 time, that it differs from the type of the genus Melonites, in having only four, 

 instead of eight double rows of pores to each ambulacrum. Since that time 

 we have been led to regard this difference as being of more than specific im- 

 portance, though until other species or better specimens are known, we cannot 

 be quite sure it is of full generic value, especially since these forms seem to be 

 exactly alike in other respects. We therefore now propose to found upon this 

 species a subgenus, under the name of Oligoporus (jtxiytt, few ; and mgo;, opening 

 or pore.) 



We also avail ourselves of the present opportunity to correct the following 

 errata, which were overlooked in correcting the proof of the paper mentioned

 without scales, and trigonal. Body much compressed and tapering to 

 the tail; peduncle of the tail very slender. Eye unusually large, circular, 

 diameter entering two and two-thirds times in the length of the side of 

 the head; the orbits are one diameter distant. The posterior extremity 

 of the maxillary bone extends to a vertical line drawn anteriorly to the 

 anterior margin of the orbit. The nostrils are situated anteriorly to the 

 eyes, and are about three diameters distant. Anterior to, between, and 

 posterior to the orbits, are numerous pores, with channelled, slender 

 depressions over the forehead and occiput, leading to the orifices of these 

 pores. A well-defined, carinated row of scales commenoe, on each side, at

 to the posterior insertion of the anal fin. The dorsal fin has its anterior 

 insertion at the commencement of the posterior third of the total length of the 

 body, and extends to within three-fourths of an inch of the insertion of the 

 caudal fin. The pectoral fin has its insertion immediately behind the margin 

 of the opercle, and the extremities of the rays reach the insertion of the caudal 

 fin. The ventral fins are unusually small, and have their length equal to their 

 width. The anterior insertions of the ventral fins are slightly posterior to the 

 corresponding insertion of the dorsal fin, and its termination is opposite that of 

 the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is deeply furcated, with the lower lobe of the 

 fin one-third longer than the upper. 4

Description of new specie3 of Apodal Fishes in the Museum of the Academy of 

 Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia. 



BY CHARLES C. ABBOTT. 



Genus Herpetoichthys, Kaup. 



Diagn. Jaws nearly equally long. Snout short. Gullet wide. Eyes near 

 the end of the snout. Head depressed, so that the eyes are nearer the upper 

 surface than they are distant from each other laterally. Anterior nostril tubu- 

 lar at the extremity of the snout, and the hinder one at the commencement 

 of the outer row of palatine teeth. Between the two, on the border of the 

 upper lip, there is a small cutaneous tag. Pectoral fins moderately short. Six 

 or seven nasal teeth, and from nine to thirteen vomerine ones. 



1. Herpetoichthys c a 1 1 i s o m a , Abbott. Spec. char. Head depressed; 

 the facial outline slightly oblique, and without curvature. The jaws are 

 flattened, and the snout terminates in a rather obtuse point. The eyes are 

 large, longitudinally oval ; the diameter of the orbits entering three times in 

 the length of the side of the head, measuring from the angle of the jaws. The 

 gill-opening is large and perpendicular ; it is situated as much more poste- 

 riorly to the extremity of the snout, as anteriorly to the commencement of 

 the dorsal fin, as four is to one. The dorsal fin arises nearly opposite to the 

 tips of the rays of the pectoral, when it is extended backwards, and reaches 

 to within a short distance of the extremity of the tail ; it retains a uniform 

 height until it nears the posterior eighth of the total length, when it rapidly 

 decreases to its termination. The anus is situated slightly posteriorly to the 

 anterior third of the total length ; and, at its posterior margin the anal fin 

 originates, and from thence proceeds the lower surface of the body, and is co- 

 terminal with the dorsal fin. 



The teeth upon the mandible and palate are biserial ; the dentition elsewhere 

 is uniserial. Nasal teeth eight ; compressed, blunt, inwardly directed ; four 

 are upon the mesial line, the anterior two smaller than the others. Vomerine 

 teeth eleven ; these form a nearly straight line, and have the anterior six 

 somewhat larger than the other five. Palatine teeth upon the outer row 

 eleven ; upon the inner row ten ; they are similar to the nasal teeth. Mandi- 

 bular teeth similar in shape to the nasal teeth, sixteen upon the outer row ; 

 ten upon the inner row. 



Color. The head, and that portion of the back anterior to the pectoral 

 fins, is dull brown, with a purple tint. On a line with the angle of the mouth, 

 extending as far back as the base of the pectorals, this color is uniform, but 

 below this line it becomes much paler and white, in irregular patches. Upon 

 the head and neck there are numerous circular blackish spots, which occa- 

 sionally run into each other, forming irregular blotches. The throat is longi- 

 tudinally marked with slender black lines, which extend nearly parallel, and 

 reach the base of the pectorals. The ground color of the body is a uniform 

 yellowish-brown, lighter on the belly ; along the sides, from the pectoral fin 

 to the termination of the dorsal, are large, circular, equidistant, very deep 

 brown spots, their diameter equal to two-thirds of the width of the body. 

 Above and between the large lateral spots, exists a regular row of smaller, but 

 similarly shaped spots ; the first two commencing anteriorly to the insertion 

 of the dorsal fin, and nearly joining upon the back. Beneath and between the 

 large lateral spots are smaller ones of a similar shape ; these are irregular in 

 their position and number, and differ materially, in many respects, on the two 

 sides of the body. The dorsal fin is white, marked with irregular spots, of a 

 color similar to those upon the body. The anal fin is similar in its coloration 

 to the dorsal. The pectorals have a number of very minute dots upon them.

Habitat. Pacific Ocean ? Cabinet of the Academy. 



A single specimen of this magnificent fish is in the collection presented by 

 W. G. Burke, Esq. This specimen, at first glance, would not appear to belong 

 to the genus Herpetoichthys ; but the slight variations are not sufficient to refer 

 the species to any other genus. The exact locality from which the species 

 was obtained is uncertain, but various circumstances induce me to suspect it 

 is a species belonging to the Pacific fauna. 



Genus Pisoodonophis, Kaup. 



Diagn. Teeth short, conic, and more or less blunt. Anterior nostril tube 

 well developed, and approximating the corner of the mouth. Pectorals more 

 or less fully developed. 



2. Pisoodonophis magnifica, Abbott. Spec. char. Head small, facial 

 outline with an oblique curvature ; the snout rather obtuse, with the upper 

 jaw extending much beyond the lower, making the nasal teeth visible when 

 the mouth is closed. The body is perfectly cylindrical, and tapers very 

 gradually to the tail, which terminates in a conico-acute horny point. The 

 dorsal fin has its anterior insertion at the occiput, and the fin terminates 

 before it reaches the horny extremity of the tail. The anal fin is coterminal 

 with the dorsal. The pectoral fin is small, circular, with twenty rays. The 

 teeth are all very small, conical, and acute, six standing irregularly on the 

 disc of the nasal bone. The teeth upon the palate, vomer, and mandible are 

 biserial, and placed very close to each other. Palatine teeth ; 

 vomerine teeth 



Color. In alcoholic specimens, the ground color of this fish is pink, darkest 

 upon the back, and nearly lost upon the belly, which appears white, without 

 close inspection. At the base of the anterior nasal tubes are two very small 

 dark chocolate-brown, semicircular spots ; behind these, and anterior to the 

 orbits, are situated two similar markings, but larger, and little deeper in 

 color. Commencing at the insertion of the dorsal fin are two series of spots 

 of chocolate color, separated only by that fin ; these spots, if viewed from 

 above, have the appearance of transverse bands. These spots are not, in every 

 case, directly opposite, but they are generally so. Upon the sides is a single 

 series of spots, of the tints of the dorsal markings, which are two-thirds of the 

 width of the sides, measuring from the base of the dorsal to the centre 

 of the belly. Upon the belly are three rows of small, circular spots, which are 

 very irregular as to position. 



Total length, 19 inches. To anus, 8 inches. To gill-opening, 1 J mch. 



Habitat. Sandwich Islands. 



The Museum of the Academy contains two specimens, which were collected 

 and presented by Dr. J. K. Townsend. 



3. Murzena acutirostris, Abbott. Spec. char. Head much compressed ; 

 the facial outline moderately oblique ; the jaws greatly attenuated, very 

 slender; the lower mandible somewhat the smaller, with a gentle upward 

 curve at its extremity. The fold of the skin, enveloping the dorsal fin, is 

 unusually thin, and arises within a short distance of the occiput, with a slope 

 of about forty-five degrees. The fin is equal in width to seven-eighths of the 

 width of the body, and has no perceivable decrease until it approaches the 

 posterior eighth of the body, when it decreases rapidly, and at its termination 

 is only equal to one-seventh of the width of the fin upon the back. The eye 

 is large, circular, its diameter equal to one-fifth of the length of the side of 

 the head, measuring from the angle of the jaws ; the orbits are one diameter 



[Oct. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 477 



distant, and the distance from the upper edge of the orbit to the facial outline 

 is equal to the distance between the lower margin of the orbit and free edge of 

 the upper lip. The gill-opening is rather small, oblique, situated as far pos- 

 teriorly to the commencement of the dorsal fin as that is posterior to the angle 

 of the jaws. (The pores upon the snout and lateral line, in this specimen, 

 are not visible. ) 



The teeth are uniserial, compressed, and very acute ; the palatines, 

 vomerine, and mandibular teeth all inwardly directed. Nasal teeth fourteen ; 

 widely set, and from three to five minute teeth between each pair. Three 

 teeth are placed upon the mesial line ; the second one very slender, and the 

 longest tooth in the mouth ; the third is twice as great in circumference, 

 and but little shorter than the second tooth. Twelve compressed, acute teeth 

 are situated upou the vomer, in a direct line ; the anterior tooth much the 

 largest. Palatine teeth, thirteen, of a uaiform size ; the series commencing 

 below the centre of the orbit and terminating shortly anteriorly to the angle of 

 the jaws. The mandible is armed with twenty-six teeth upon each side ; the 

 anterior four of each side being nearly three times as great in size, more widely 

 set, and the posterior pair have a single, compressed, very small tooth between 

 them. 



Color. The ground color of this species is a dark hair brown, nearly black 

 upon the occiput and cheek, and along the base of the dorsal fin. The head, 

 body, and both fins are irregularly reticulated with narrow bands of white, 

 varyirg in width and becoming yellow on the posterior fifth of the dorsal fin, 

 and upon that portion of the body, but in a less degree. Three broken lines of 

 black extend along the body, from the angle of the jaws to the gill- opening. 

 Iris chrome yellow. Total length 1 9i inches. To anus 9 inches. To gill- 

 opening 2f inches. 



Habitat. Sandwich Islands. 



A single specimen of this peculiar Murana was brought from the above 

 locality, and presented to the Academy, by Dr. J. K. Townsend, to whom the 

 Academy is indebted for many species of fishes, which enrich their icthyo- 

 logical cabinet. 



The peculiarity of this 3Iurcena, which immediately falls under the notice of 

 the icthyologist, is the remarkably slender snout ; which consequently gives 

 the dentition an unusual aspect, in crowding the marginal nasal teeth and those 

 upon the mesial line into close proximity ; and the vomerine teeth so close to 

 the palatines. The great acuteness of the teeth in every series, their close 

 proximity, and inward direction, aive this species a ferocious appearance, 

 which certainly must be realized by every unfortunate fish, whose fate it is to 

 be mangled by his jaws. 



4. Thyrsoidea Kaupii, Abbott. The genus Thyrsoidea differs from 

 Murmna by having the palatine teeth biserial. 



Spec. Char. Head, facial outline, and general characters of the jaws, except 

 their less tenuity, similar to Murcena acutirostris, Abb. The fold of the skin, 

 enveloping the dorsal fin, is thick on the anterior portion of the fin, and pre- 

 vents the rays from being felt. The commencement of the dorsal fin is twice 

 as far distant from the gill-opening, as from the angle of the jaws. The eye is 

 large, longitudinally oval ; its longitudinal diameter entering four times in the 

 length of the side of the head, measuring from the angle of the jaws. The 

 anterior nostrils are furnished with long slender tubes, which extend to the 

 free margin of the lip ; the posterior nostrils are not tubular. The anus is 

 situated two inches anteriorly to the centre of the total length. The body, 

 posteriorly to the anus, tapers slowly to the extremity of the tail, which is very 

 acute. 



The nasal teeth number twelve ; they are tall, slender, inwardly directed, 

 with two very minute teeth between nearly every pair. Two teeth, similar to 

 the marginal nasal teeth, stand upon the mesial line, and are the tallest teeth

in the mouth. Seven short-conical, rather hlunt teeth, with the anterior two 

 twice as large as the others, stand upon the vomer ; the anterior second tooth 

 a little beyond the line of the others, otherwise they form a straight series. 

 The palatine teeth number twelve or thirteen ; they are very much compressed, 

 acute, are set near to each other, and are inwardly directed ; these form the outer 

 and principal series. Two much larger ones, very near the commencement of 

 the outer series, and within that series, form the interior row. This inner row 

 is similar in its characters, except as to number, to the outer row of palatines. 

 The mandible is armed with a compliment of twenty-two, short, compressed 

 teeth, all inwardly directed ; the six upon the extremity of the jaw, are three 

 times as great in length, as the principal series, and between them is generally 

 a pair of minute teeth, which are hidden by the lip, and often entirely con- 

 cealed in the soft parts of the jaw. 



Color. The head and body are of a uniform dark umber, the back and sides 

 crossed by coarse reticulations of bright sienna. The fins are nearly black, 

 with the reticulating bands that cross the body, continuous upon them. The 

 head is free from the bands of sienna, as is the throat and a small anterior 

 portion of the belly. Upon the throat and sides of the neck are narrow longi- 

 tudinal black lines, extending as far back as the gill-opening. 



Total length 18 inches. To anus 8 inches. To gill-opening 2 l-5th inches. 



Habitat. Sandwich Islands. 



This handsomely marked species of Thyrsoidea has every appearance of a 

 Murana, and unless closely examined might be referred that genus. The pres- 

 ence of the inner row of palatine teeth, however, preclude the propriety of its 

 being so classed. This species belongs to that class of the genus, which has 

 but two teeth upon the inner row of palatines ; a peculiarity which is of too 

 slight importance to be considered generic, and is too constant to be considered 

 specific. The specimen from which the description was taken, was presented 

 to the Academy by Dr. J. K. Townsend. 



This species is named in honor of Dr. J. J. Kaup, of Darmstadt, to whom 

 science is indebted for the first systematic elucidation of the history of the 

 Apodal Fishes. 



5. Thyrsoidea eurosta, Abbott. Spec. char. Head large, depressed; 

 the facial outline very slightly oblique. The fold of the skin enveloping the 

 lorsal fin is very thick, and arises slightly behind the occiput, nearly perpen- 

 dicularly; the fin is of uniform height for two-thirds of its length, when it 

 slowly decreases to its termination. The eye is large, circular, and slightly 

 behind the extremity of the snout ; the orbits are one diameter and a half dis- 

 tant. The jaws are of equal length, and rather slender; the lower jaw with a 

 flight upward curve at its extremity, making the large mandibular teeth 

 partially visible when the mouth is closed. The nasal teeth number ten ; they 

 are biserial, and the inner row are twice as large in every respect as the outer 

 iow; they are conical, acute, and with a decided inward inclination. The 

 palatine teeth number twenty-eight upon the outer row; and nine upon the 

 inner row. The teeth constituting the outer row of palatines are short, very 

 much compressed and acute ; they have a moderate inward inclination. The 

 inner row of palatines are widely set, of various lengths, and have a gape in 

 their series, commencing posteriorly opposite the posterior margin of the orbit, 

 and ceasing opposite the anterior edges of the orbit; the teeth upon the inner 

 series are more than twice as large in all respects as those of the outer row. 

 The vomerine teeth number twelve, nine of which are in a direct line, and the 

 remaining three concurrent with the central three of the series. The lower jaw 

 is armed with a complement of twenty-four compressed, acute teeth, having a 

 decidedly inward inclination ; the posterior twelve of these are closely set, and 

 in an unbroken series ; the anterior twelve are arranged in pairs, except at the 

 extremity of the jaw, where they form two square patches of four teeth each. 



Color. The body and head are of a uniform reddish brown, which become 



[Oct.

nearly black upon the under surface of the tail. The whole surface is minutely 

 spotted, and reticulated with pale yellowish. 



Total length, 13.} inches. To aau3 6 inches. To gill-opening 1J inches. 



Habitat. Sandwich Islands. 



This species is remarkably stout for its length, and presents an unusually 

 large number of teeth for the size of the animal. But a single specimen is in 

 the museum ; which specimen was collected and presented by Dr. J. K. Town- 

 send. 



6. Thyrsoidea coacolor, Abbott. Spec. char. Head compressed, slightly 

 lepressed upon the occiput Jaws slender. The eye is large, circular, its diame- 

 ter contained four times in the length of the side of the head, measuring from 

 the angle of the jaws. The dorsal fin originates at the occiput, and has a 

 slope at its commencement, of about forty-five degrees, the fin is of a uniform 

 height, until midway between the anus and the extremity of the tail, when it 

 ommences gradually to decrease. The anus is slightly anterior to the centre 

 of the body, and the anal fin, that there has its commencement, is equal in 

 width to one-tenth of the width of the body, and extends to the extremity of 

 the tail, preserving throughout a nearly uniform width. 



The nasal teeth number twelve ; they are all slender, conical and acute, with 

 a pair of minute, compressed teeth between each pair of the marginal teeth 

 three teeth stand upon the mesial line, the centre one of which is the tallest 

 tooth in the mouth. The outer row of the palatine teeth number sixteen ; they 

 are of uniform height, compresed, acute and with an inward tendency. The 

 inner row consists of two teeth, placedat the commencement of the outer row ; 

 they are similar in all their characters to the teeth upon that row, except in 

 being of nearly triple the height. On the vomer, exist ten conical, acute teeth, 

 in a straight line ; they are of a uniform size. The mandible is armed with a 

 compliment of twenty compressed, acute teeth, having a decided inward incli- 

 nation, but in a less degree than in the palatines ; the anterior six teeth are 

 much larger than the general series, and are more conical in their shape. 



Color. The head, body and fins are of a uniform purplish brown, varvino' in 

 its intensity upon the sides. 



Total length, 11 inches. To anus 5|- inches. To gill-opening \\ inches. 



Habitat. Vera Cruz. 



A single specimen is in the museum, presented by Dr. Burroughs, and labelled 

 as procured at the above locality. 



Note. On pages 326 and 327, hujus operis, there are described two Elheosto- 

 pioids, named respectively Poecilosoma transversum and Pileoma cymatogramma.

This species is very well characterized by the larger row of scales along the 

 median line of the back ; the granulations upon the sides are much smaller 

 than those of the back and abdomen, and there is a larger row of scales upon 

 the back of the tail ; immediately behind the mental plate are six scales, in 

 a transverse row, the four intermediate quite small, the lateral much larger ; 

 the occipital scale lies in a well marked depression, the supra-orbitar ridges 

 are nearly in contact, and on the front part of the head is a longitudinal

ovoid depression, the scales of which, are smooth ; those upon the snout cari- 

 nated, as also the scales upon the abomen ; the colors of these specimens are 

 much darker than that of another ; brownish above, and orange colored 

 mingled with yellow beneath ; in the other, the general color is golden yel- 

 low, lighter beneath, with a tinge of white upon the abdomen. Total length, 

 5 j inches ; of tail, 2 inches 8 lines. Found also in Surinam. (D. & B.) 



Anolis longicauda nob. 



Spec. char. Scales upon the muzzle keeled ; eight superior labials ; scales 

 of abdomen carinated ; dorsal scales indistinctly carinated ; median rows 

 larger ; 'tail very long ; color green ; gular pouch orange, with two indigo- 

 colored lateral stripes, one on each side. Total length, 5 inches, 5 lines. 



Description. 44 teeth in the upper jaw ; 10 posterior tricuspid; 43 in the 

 lower ; the 10 or 11 posterior distinctly trilobed ; scales upon the muzzle 

 keeled ; two crests upon the head, prolongations of the superciliary ridges, 

 circumscribing laterally a longitudinal depression, broader in front ; the 

 scales in this depression polygonal, much larger than those upon the muzzle, 

 keeled ; eight superior labials ; six rows of scales upon the side of the head 

 anteriorly, between the superior labials and its upper margin ; auricular open- 

 ing moderate ; abdominal scales much the largest, keeled ; those upon the sides 

 very small, granular ; back covered with polygonal scales, indistinctly 

 carinated ; several of the median rows larger than the others ; breadth of head 

 posteriorly, one-half of its total length ; body and extremities slender ; tail 

 very long and tapering, round at base, more than double the length of head 

 and body ; color bluish above, probably green during life ; lighter upon the 

 tail ; abdomen, chin, under part of tail and extremities very light blue ; gular 

 pouch orange with two indigo -colored stripes, one on each side. Total 

 length 5 inches, 5 lines ; of tail, 3 inches, 10 lines. One specimen. 



Gen. remarks. This species is quite different from An. sericeus, a Mexi- 

 can species, in which the scales upon the back are granular, and of nearly 

 equal size ; it is also a stouter animal, and the tail is shorter. Anolis tro- 

 pidogaster nob., from New Grenada, is destitute of the two well marked 

 crests so characteristic of this species, and the plates lying at the bottom of 

 the longitudinal depression between them are much longer than those on the 

 corresponding position in tropidogaster; and the shape of this de- 

 pression is quite different, being much broader in front, in longicauda. 

 In Anolis pulchellus D. Sr B., the carinations of the scales before the 

 back and abdomen are indistinct ; whereas, in the present species they are 

 well marked : the tail in the former is but one-third the total length. 



Anolis cupreus nob. 



Spec. char. Scales upon muzzle carinated ; supraorbital ridges separated 

 by several rows of scales; three or four rows of scales inteivening between 

 each interorbitar ridge and. the occipital scale ; six superior labials ; abdominal

 black, forming three distinct jet black bands on each side ; these jet 

 black bands are more distinct in the youngest specimens ; in the oldest the 

 upper surface is of an uniform olive color, darker upon the sides ; the entire 

 surface of the abdomen, and the greater part of the under surface of the 

 thighs, jet black ; anterior part of forearms white spotted ; these spots quite 

 small, and by no means so distinct or near so large as inC. lemniscatus;

[Oct. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 483 



Gen. remarks. This species is readily distinguished from C. leinnis- 

 c a t u s , the latter having but nine lines, the middle one of which bifurcates 

 toward the occiput, and the sides more or less white spotted. 



Cnemidophorus quadrilineatus nob. 



Spec. char. Nostril between the naso-rostral and naso-frenal plate ; five 

 supra-labials ; eight rows of abdominal scales ; color brownish black above ; 

 jet black upon the sides, with two very narrow white lines, extending from 

 the temples in a line with the posterior margin of the eye, extending as far as 

 the posterior extremities ; a single row of broad scales upon the anterior sur- 

 surface of the forearms. Total length 3 inches 3 lines. 



Description. The above appears to be one of the smallest of the species of 

 Cnemidophorus. It is readily distinguished by its small size, and the pecu- 

 liarity of its markings ; in front of the gular fold is a row of four large scales, 

 followed by several smaller ones ; the back, between the two inner stripes, is 

 vermiculated with black, the sides white spotted ; the tail presents a white 

 lateral stripe, a continuation of the lower one upon the side ; under parts 

 bluish, lighter upon the chin. 



Dimensions. Length of head 5 lines ; of body to vent 11 lines ; length of 

 tail 2^ inches ; total length 3 inches 4 lines. 



Habitat. Nicaragua. Four specimens. 



Gen. remarks. Cnemidophorus prresignis B. $ G., from Chagres, said 

 also to be common at Para, has ten rows of abdominal plates. 



Ameiva Cuvier. 

 Ajieiva pulchka nob. 



Spec. char. Nostril between the naso-rostral and naso-frenal plates ; a 

 group of large scales upon the chin, surrounded by smaller ones ; three 

 or four large scales in front of the gular fold, surrounded by smaller scales ; 

 eight rows of abdominal plates ; color olive above, with two lateral stripes of 

 brown, one on each side, with numerous transverse rows of black. Total 

 length 8 1 2 inches. 



Description. This is a beautiful species of Ameiva, presenting distinctly 

 the characters of the genus, viz. . the retractility of the tongue beneath the 

 glottis, which distinguishes Ameiva from Cnemidophorus. In a natural 

 series, it would take the place of Ameiva Sloanei, which it resembles very 

 closely in size, but the neck is not near so narrow as in that species ; there is 

 but a single row of large transverse scales in front of the forearm ; the granu- 

 lations upon the back are distinctly larger than those upon the sides ; twenty 

 femoral pores ; the color of the head is light brown above, and upon the sides ; 

 olive colored or light brown tipon the back, with a band of deep brown along- 

 each side, presenting numerous transverse bars of black ; abdomen bluish, the 

 rest of the under surface white, with a tinge of blue ; in many of the speci- 

 mens a row of white spots extends from the tympanum to the posterior 

 extremity, occasionally assuming the form of a very narrow white line ; a 

 white spot upon the temple, and three or four around the margin of the tym- 

 panum. Eighteen specimens.

 quadrangular ; tail quite stout, with bifid scutes. Size that of a Calamarian ; 

 palatine as well as mandibular teeth apparently of equal length. 



Lioninia vermiformis nob. 



Spec. char. Color whitish above, with numerous small brown spots formed 

 by. a series of black spots, occupying each scale ; in some specimens a narrow 

 black dorsal line, extending from the occiput as far as the extremity of the tail ; 

 in others this line is quite indistinct; a spot or blotch upon the occiput, of the 

 same color as that of" the body; head brown above, lighter upon the snout; 

 under parts of animal white. Total length, 5 inches, 1 line; tail 8 lines. Ab. 

 scut. 122 ; a single preanal ; subcaud. 26. 



Habitat. Nicaragua ; 3 specimens. 



Gen. remarks. In the arrangement of the plates upon the head, this genus 

 resembles very closely Streptophorus, but the form of the scales is quite 

 different, which in the latter genus are more or less carinated. It belongs 

 to the family of Calamarians, as defined by Dumeril & Bibron, viz.: Body very 

 slender, rounded, and about the same thickness from the head to the tail. E. G. 

 tome vii. p. 48. It differs, however, from each of the nine- genera of which 

 that family is composed. In Calamaria and Rhabdosoma, the nostrils open in 

 a single scale, as well as in Rabdion, Homalosoma and Carphophis. In Elapoidis, 

 the scales are carinated. In Aspidura, the urostega are in a single row.

Gen. remarks. Dumeril & Bibron describe thirteen species of Euprepis, of 

 which but two have the inferior eyelid destitute of a transparent disk, viz.: 

 E. S e b ae and E. E r n e s t i. From both of these the species above described 

 differs remarkably. It the latter the supranasals are not contiguous ; in the 

 former the carina? upon the scales are indistinct; it is also a larger animal. 

 The specimen above described was taken on South Brother Island, Gaspar 

 Straits, by Mr. Squires, of the U. S. steamer T. Hancock. It is common. The 

 Malay name is Kjedal.

Description. The teeth are strong, sharp-pointed, much inclined backward, 

 the eyes are of moderate size, the pupil round; the rostral plate is triangular 

 in shape, broader than high, the internasals of moderate size, the prefrontals 

 very large, and more or less rhomboidal in shape ; the frontal quite broad 

 anteriorly, its latero-superior angles bevelled, presenting an obtuse angle 

 posteriorly; the supra-oculars long, of moderate breadth behind ; the occipitals 

 much longer than broad ; nostrils between two plates, large ; the posterior the 

 larger of the two ; the frenal is remarkable for its great length and unusual 

 position ; its upper margin is curved, terminating in a point posteriorly, about 

 one-half of it passing below the antocular; there are ten superior labials ; the 

 eye resting on the sixth and seventh ; the seventh is larger and of quite a 

 different shape from the others, its posterior portion being prolonged upward

 inches ; of tail 8 inches; circumference 2 inches, 8 lines. 



Platurus fasciatds Var. 

 Char. Snout black ; extremity of tail black ; forty complete black bands upon 

 the body; besides three incomplete upon the neck; six complete black bands 

 upon the tail ; three and a-half rows of scales in black bands upon the back, 

 and one and a-half in the white interspace. Total length 1 foot, 9 J inches. The 

 largest specimen measures 3 feet, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in circumference. 

 The tail measures 4i inches in length by 1} inches in height at its base. The 

 coloration corresponds with that of the plate of Hydrophis colubrina, in 

 the Fauna Japonica. The abdomen, chin and throat are ochraceous throughout, 

 the bands having disappeared entirely from the belly; 23 rows of, scales near 

 the middle of the body; chin and throat covered with scales; ab. scuta. 198, 

 of which the 4 last are bifid ; 32 bifid urostega. Besides the above there are 

 two other specimens, from Cleopatra Island, more fully grown, one completely 

 adult. (Hydrophis colubrina SchlegePs Fauna Japonica, tab. 10). The only 

 difference which I observe between the latter and Prof. Schlegel's specimen, is 

 that the scales in the latter do not appear to be quite so broad. The markings 

 in the two specimens before us are quite different from those of the younger 

 ones, in which the black and white bands are very distinct and complete, 

 encircling the whole body ; but in the one which may be nearly half grown, they 

 are so only upon the tail and the posterior part of the body, the abdomen being 

 of a dull, ochraceous yellow in the greater part of its extent, as well as the neck 

 and throat, somewhat deeper brown opposite the bands ; the length of this 

 specimen is 2 feet, 9^ inches ; circumference 3 inches, 3 lines ; the extremity 

 of fhe tail is black ; 6 complete bands upon the tail. 



Two other specimens of this variety are in the collection, from Loo-Choo, 

 younger than either of the others. In the smaller, which measures 1 foot, 2 

 inches in length, and 8 lines only in circumference, the black rings are of nearly 

 equal iengthupon the back and abdomen, being very closely approximated in 

 the latter position ; the very tip of the tail in the smallest specimen is white. 

 The specimen marked 243, taken by Capt. Stevens, at Cleopatra Island (north 

 of Ousima), May, 1855.

 five first smaller than the others ; 34 lower, two canines of about equal length 

 The teeth, with the exception of the Ianiaries and intermaxillaries, are all very 

 closely in contact, inclining inward, and firmly imbedded in the jaw, and hot: 

 along its border ; no palatine teeth. 



Diploderma polygonatum nob. 



Description. A longitudinal row of carinated scales upon the snout behind 

 the nostril ; frontal region depressed ; supraciliary ridges low, separated from 

 each other by two rows of small scales, and communicating with the longi- 

 tudinal ridge above mentioned by two or three scales on each side ; supra- 

 ocular regions convex ; no well marked occipital scale ; seven superior labials ; 

 a nuchal, not elevated crest ; no transverse gular fold ; neck slightly folded : 

 body slender, covered with carinated scales, some of which, here and there 

 interspersed, are much larger than the others ; the axilla, and that part of 

 the body immediately within the arm and above it, covered with very small 

 scales ; this patch of small scales contrasting strongly with the larger scales

Habitat. Amakarima Island. One specimen. 



Gen. remarks. Lyriocephalus, Otocryptus, Ceratophorus, and Phryno- 

 cephalus are Iguanian Acrodont saurians, with ears concealed beneath the 

 integument ; but Diploderma differs from each of these. Lyriocephalus has 

 the snout surmounted by a rounded protuberance ; the dentition of Oto- 

 cryptus is altogether different, and in Ceratophorus, as its name indicates, the 

 snout is prolonged into a sort of horn. See D. & B. torn. v. p. 433. The 

 head of Phrynocephalus is nearly circular ; the tail is much shorter, and the 

 body is covered all over with minute scales, being quite a different animal in 

 its general appearance. 



Otoceyptis Weig. 



Among the saurians in the Loo-Choo collection is a very small Acrodont 

 Iguanian, no doubt a young animal, which appears to belong to a genus very 

 near if not identical with the Otocryptus of Weigmann. The form of the head, 

 however, is different from that of Otocryptus, as described by Dumeril & 

 Bibron, and the number of molar teeth is less, viz. : eight instead of twelve. 

 The specimen, small as it is, is much mutilated, and otherwise injured, but 

 the following characters can be distinctly made out. 



Gen. char. Head rounded, and high posteriorly, the anterior slope 

 more gradual than the posterior, the front and vertex being nearly on 

 a line ; snout covered with polygonal scales ; supraorbitar ridges dis- 

 tinct ; eyelids covered with carinated scales of nearly equal size ; occiput 

 covered with polygonal scales, partly smooth, partly carinate ; temples 

 covered with carinated scales; eyelids covered with small scales. The in- 

 cisor teeth on each side separate, a conical canine, and eight tricuspid, the 

 first three the smallest, the last two the largest ; the same number in the 

 lower jaw ; ears concealed by the integument ; body covered with scales 

 arranged in transverse rows ; five fingers without serratures, the fourth finger 

 a little the longest, all armed with recurved nails ; tail slender. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4 lines ; of neck and body 6^ lines ; of tail 

 (mutilated) 10 lines ; length of anterior extremities 6 lines ; of posterior

Spec. char. Rostral plate comparatively high; internasal presenting 

 an obtuse and rounded angle posteriorly ; fronto-nasal not in contact, being 

 separated by a considerable interval ; frontal plate heptagonal, more or less 

 truncate anteriorly ; seven superior labials ; olive colored above, with a tinge 

 of red upon the head, and a broad, brickdust colored stripe, commencing upon 

 the temples, and extending along the sides of the neck, and the body, as far 

 the root of the tail ; under parts silvery white. Twenty-five rows of scales ; 

 five in front of the tail. 



Dimensions. Length of head 11^ lines ; greatest breadth 8 lines ; length of 

 body 2 inches 8 lines ; of tail 2 inches 9 lines ; of anterior extremities 11 lines ; 

 of posterior 15 lines. 



Habitat. Ousima, Japan, and Loo-Choo Islands. 



Gen. remarks. The specimen from Loo-Choo is much smaller, and evidently 

 the young of the same species. The lateral stripe of brown is bordered with 

 obscure white, and there is a vitta of the same color running along the middle 

 of the back. This species, with the exception of the lateral band bears a 

 striking resemblance to Plestiodon laticeps of the Southern U. S., but the 

 red upon the head is not near so deep, and the shape of the rostral and 

 frontal plates is quite different, and the fronto-nasals are closely in contact.

the scales upon the top of the head are carinate : eight superior labials ; 

 third and fourth the largest ; seven temporals ; the two anterior, of which the 

 superior is the larger, separated from the orbit by a row of small scales ; the 

 plates over the eyes are of moderate size, single ; the rostral plate is broader 

 than high ; the head is much larger posteriorly than in front, where it 

 is somewhat truncate ; neck much contracted ; body rather slender, 

 presenting near the middle twenty-seven rows of lanceolate carinate 

 scales, the carina? extending the whole length of the scale, and the 

 rows running very obliquely ; besides these carinated scales there are two 

 other inferior rows, running very obliquely, which are smooth, the total num- 

 ber of rows of scales being thirty-one ; the scales upon the tail are much broader 

 than those upon the back ; the ground color of the head above is ochraceous 

 yellow, presenting numerous dark colored lines, probably green during life ; 

 a narrow vitta of the same color extends from behind the eye to the posterior 

 and external angle of the head, a short distance above the commissure of the 

 jaw ; a bar, broader than the rest, is seen on each side of the inner aspect of 

 the occiput, bending inward, and extending for a space of two and a half 

 inches along the side of the neck ; the jaws and throat are yellow (straw 

 colored), as well as the abdomen ; the under part of the tail is also yellow, but 

 presents a number of bluish colored maculae on each side ; the ground color 

 of the body above is dirty yellow, with longitudinal dark colored interrupted 

 liars on each side of the median line, with intervening spaces of yellow ; upon 

 the tail the dark colored portions present the form of double triangles, united 

 at their bases, upon the median line, with a subround yellow spot in the 

 centre, and having upon their sides triangular interspaces of yellow ; eighty-one 

 urostega ; ab. scuta sixty-one. The specimen being much mutilated, it is 

 difficult to ascertain with precision its total length.

Habitat. Specimens marked No. 5, found in the Paddyfields at the 

 Amakarima Isle, Loo-Choo, April, 1855, by Mr. Squires and Mr. Macomb. 

 Other specimens, marked 53 in the Catalogue, from Ralousima. Those from 

 this place, the northern half of Ousima proper, are yellow beneath, without 

 the large black spots upon the abdomen. 



Gen. remarks. This species resembles much Triton cristatus of Europe, 

 but wants the white, minute points upon the sides and chin, and the tail is 

 much longer. According to Prof. Schlegel, the osteology of the head is also 

 different, and the number of vertebrae less, there being sixteen in Triton 

 cristatus, and but fourteen in the present species. We have compared 

 these specimens with one from Japan, due to the generosity of the Adminis- 

 tration of the Garden of Plants, and find no difference except that the black 

 spots upon the abdomen are not so numerous in the Japanese specimen, and 

 the tail is shorter and less compressed at its root. The coloration above, in 

 the Japanese specimen, is brown ; in those from Amakarima Island, a deep 

 black. We had proposed for this dark colored Triton, with its narrow and

 Plestiodon D. & R. 



There is, in the collection of Com. Rodgers, but one specimen of five-lined 

 Plestiodon, which, both by Prof. Schlegel and Dumeril & Bibron, have been 

 considered identical with the Plestiodon quinquelineatus of the U. S. 

 Prof. Schlegel states that he had before him two complete suites of the North 

 American and Japanese species, composed each of thirty individuals of all 

 ages, the one collected at Japan, by MM. de Si'ebold and Biirger, the other by 

 Prof. Trout, upon the banks of the Tennessee river. The examination of this 

 large number of specimens proved to him that there existed not the slightest 

 difference between these individuals, brought from points of the globe so distant 

 the one from the other, although situated under nearly the same parallel. 

 (Fauna Japonica, Reptilia, p. 99.) 



Dumeril & Bibron say, that having examined two of the Japanese speci- 

 mens, the North American species exists also in Japan. (Erpet. Gen. torn. v. 

 p. 710.) The most striking difference that we observe in the single speci- 

 men before us, consists in the presence in the one from Japan, of a plate 

 above the anterior frenal, which is wanting in all the others ; this doubling 

 may be, and probably is, an accident, and an abnormal division of the anterior 

 frontal plate. There are, also, but twenty-four rows of scales in the Japanese 

 specimen. The coloration of the specimens from these different localities 

 is very much alike, except that the vertebral line does not bifurcate 

 upon the head in that from Japan. The fronto-nasals are not in contact, 

 but in some of the North American specimens this is the case, in others 

 not. We have always doubted, notwithstanding the high authority of 

 the authors quoted, the absolute identity of species so remote. Since 

 the above was written, another specimen has been placed in our hands, 

 in which there "is no naso-frenal, only two frenals, an anterior and a poste- 

 rior, and there is a difference in the number of rows of scales, there being 

 twenty-seven in the Japanese, and thirty-two in the North American. In a 

 specimen from South Carolina, presented by Dr. Blanding to the Academy, 

 there are thirty-two rows : in one from the Loo-Choo Islands, by Dr. Joseph 



I860.] 




49G PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



Wilson, U. S. N., but twenty-four. The scales upon tlie back, in the Loo- 

 Choo specimen, are broader than those in the one from South Carolina. The 

 fronto-nasal and fronto-parietal much smaller in the Loo-Choo specimen, the 

 former les^ than half the size ; in the latter the frenal is more high and 

 narrow ; in the one from South Carolina, there is a naso-frenal, a plate 

 which does not exist in the specimen from Loo-choo. In the large North 

 American specimens in the Green collection, we count twenty-nine and thirty 

 rows of scales : both these have a naso-frenal in front of the anterior frenal. 

 In a specimen from Arkansas, presented by Mr. Pitcher, we find twenty-nine 

 rows of scales, and no naso-frenal, a near approach to the Japan ; but the 

 scales upon the back are evidently less broad. In another specimen from 

 South Carolina, presented by Prof. Leidy, we find thirty-two rows, with a 

 naso-frennl ; scales of the back high. In another from South Carolina, pre- 

 sented by Mr. Reid, we find twenty-nine and thirty rows. In the specimen 

 from Japan, which is young, the ground color between the stripes is jet 

 black ; in those from Loo-Choo, which are more mature, the color above is 

 olive, with a dark colored lateral band on each side, between the lateral 

 stripe ; the most constant difference determined by the above comparisons, 

 therefore, would appear to be the less number of rows of scales in the 

 Japanese, the greater breadth of the dorsal rows, and the absence of the naso- 

 frenal plate. We have had, however, but three Asiatic specimens for observa- 

 tion, but would suggest whether they be not really distinct species from the 

 North American, although resembling each other so much in color ; and in case 

 future observation should decide this to be the case, would propose for the 

 Japanese species the name Plestiodox latiscutatus. 



Gen. Lygosaukus nob. 



Char. Nostril in a single plate ; neither supero-nasal, nor naso-frenal ; two 

 fronto-nasals ; an interparieto-fronto parietal ; two parietals ; a first and second 

 frenal ; two freno-orbitars ; six superior labials ; body covered with hexagonal 

 scales, tricarinate upon the back ; fingers and toes 5 5 ; the two inner and

 spots, extending a considerable distance upon the tail ; a lateral dark-colored 

 band on each side, commencing behind the eye and extending the whole length 

 of the back and body, being lost upon the tail; abdomen and under part of 

 extremities white ; the scales upon the under part of the tail spotted with 

 black. Total length 3 inches, 7 lines; tail 2 inches. 



Description. The size of this delicate-looking little Lepidosanrian is about 

 the same as that of Lygosoma laterale; the head is small, the snout rather 

 pointed, the supra-orbitar regions somewhat prominent ; the internasal is 

 broader than long ; the fronto-nasal single, truncate posteriorly, presenting 

 three facets in front, the middle one broad ; frontal truncate anteriorly, the 

 edges bevelled, angular posteriorly ; the fronto-parietals and parietals present 

 nothing remarkable, but the interparietal, instead of being placed exclusively 

 between tbe parietals, lies also and for the greater part of its extent between 

 the fronto-parietals ; it is narrow in front, broad behind ; the inferior eyelid is 

 protected by two rows of scales, the inferior row quite large, beneath which, 

 and above the supero-Iabials, there are two interrupted rows of triangular 

 scales ; four supra-orbitar scales ; auricular openings pyriform in shape, with 

 no scales upon their borders; scales hexagonal, those upon the abdomen and 

 sides smooth, those upon the back tricarinate ; 24 rows of scales, six in front 

 of the arms and of nearly equal size; extremities slender, each provided with

Gen. remarks. Although the two animals resemble each other so much 

 in their general form, the arrangement of the plates upon the head is quite 

 different. In Lygosoma laterale the scales are quite smooth.

Gen. remarks. Thi3 is evidently the Tropidonotus tigrinus of Prof. 

 Schlegel, whose remarks in regard to the differences between the one under 

 consideration and the Tropidonotus natrix of European authors, are perfectly 

 correct. Trop. tigrinus has a great resemblance to the Trop. h y d r u s of 

 Fitzinger, of which we have eight specimens in the Bonap. Coll., the markings 

 and the number of rows of scales are the same in both ; but the shape of the 

 head is very different. That of tigrinus is broad, and the snout is rounded, 

 but in hydrus it is more acute. The two serpents in fact belong to different 

 genera.

Two specimens of a frog, the coloration of which, though the animal is not 

 so large, corresponds with the figure of Rana esculenta, as given in the 

 Fauna Japonica. It differs, however, very considerably from the numerous 

 specimens of Rana esculenta in the Bonap. collection of the Academy. 

 The spots upon the back are not so regular and well defined as in e s c ul e n- 

 ta, and there exist on each side of the ventral line four or five longitudinal 

 elevations, resembling somewhat those of r u g o s a. The sides are marbled 

 with black, and there is a black band extending from the front of the eye to 

 the tip of the snout ; extremities black spotted ; thighs posteriorly marbled 

 with black ; under parts white. Length 1 inch 9 lines ; of anterior extremi- 

 ties 1 inch ; of posterior 2 inches, 10 lines.

 varying in this respect ; a black band extending from the eye to the snout on 

 each side ; legs and tarsi banded with black, thighs mottled posteriorly with 

 blotches of the same color; under parts white ; web of the toes extending as 

 far as the base of the antepenultimate phalanx, except in the third, in which it 

 reaches to the base of the proximal extremity of the third phalanx. 



Dimensions. Length of head and body 1 inch ; of anterior extremities h an 

 inch ; of posterior l\ inches. 



Habitat. Japan. One specimen discovered by Dr. Morrow. 



In the collection of reptiles from Japan, by Dr. Morrow, is one specimen of 

 a Rana figured in Schlegel, considered by Prof. S. as identical with the 

 Rana temporaria of Europe. This species, however, has even a 

 stronger resemblance to the Rana sylvatica of the United States, with 

 which it r.ppears to be identical, and from which, indeed, I do not find 

 any marked points of difference. The large blotch behind the ear, and the 

 longitudinal black mark upon the arm exist, in all these specimens, and the 

 longitudinal ridge on each side of the body. Length of head and body 1 inch 

 11 lines ; of thigh 1 inch 2 lines ; of leg 1 inch 2 lines ; of tarsus 7 lines ; of 

 foot to extremity of longest toe 1 inch ; of arm 5 lines : of forearm 5 lines ; of 

 hand to extremity of longest finger 5 lines. Found in the Paddy fields back of

Gen. remarks. This species evidently belongs to the same genus as Poly- 

 pedates megacephalu s, found at Hong Kong, and remarkable for the two 

 patches of rugosities upon the vertex ; the animal, however, is quite different 

 from the Polypedates rugosus of Ceylon and the Phillipines.

Gen. remarks. This species corresponds very nearly with the description of 

 Ixalus s e m i f a s e i a t u s D. & B., in torn. viii. p. 523 of the Erpetologie 

 Generale. It is there mentioned, however, that the palmation of the toes does 

 not extend beyond one-half of their length. In the Japan specimens it would 

 appear to be larger. In Schlegel's figure, which represents a much smaller 

 animal, there are no webs to the toes. Ixalus semifasciatus is an inhabi-

 identical or not.

Dr. Rogers exhibited some experiments to show the decomposing power of 

 CarbonicAcid in solution, on bodies containing alkalies and alkaline earths. 

 Specimens of several kinds of glass, mica and trap rock in fine powder, placed 

 on filters, were treated with a solution of carbonic acid dissolved in water. 

 A notable proportion of the alkaline bases was dissolved, as was shown by its 

 action on turmeric paper. Dr. Rogers referred to the bearing of this fact in 

 Geology, especially the absence of alkalies in the ashes of coal and the disin- 

 tegration of rocks.

Fifty members present. 



Dr. Fisher exhibited a specimen of Peat, obtained by Mr. J. C. Trautwine 

 on the Atrato River, from a bed of leaves. The bed was about thirty feet 

 thick, and the specimen exhibited was taken from about fifteen feet below the 

 surface. On the surface the leaves were fresh, but were gradually changed 

 at different depths, so that the bottom of the bed closely resembled bituminous 

 coal. 



Dr. Rogers exhibited Prof. Way's electric light, produced by the ignition of

a stream of mercury. He also exhibited the original experiment made by Dr. 

 Hare several years since, when Dr. Rogers was his assistant, and explained 

 the difference between them as consisting in the one light being formed by 

 a self-sustaining battery, and the other by a battery transient in its effects. 



Dr. Leidy read a letter from Mr. Robert D. Owen, of New Harmony, 

 announcing the death, on the 13th inst., of Dr. David Dale Owen, late 

 a Correspondent of the Academy. 



On motion of Dr. Rogers, the Secretary was directed to communicate 

 to the immediate relatives of Dr. Owen the regret of the Academy at 

 its loss. 



On motion of Dr. Rand, the thanks of the Academy were presented 

 to Messrs. Van Amburg & Co. for donations to the Museum, and the 

 privilege of giving orders of admission to the Museum on public days

The President announced the decease of our respected Vise-Presi- 

 dent, Major Le Conte, on the 21st inst., and stated the object of the 

 meeting to be to express the sense of the Academy at its loss. After 

 a short review of the character and labors of Major Le Conte, by Dr. 

 Fisher, Dr. Elwyn, Mr. Foulke and Mr. Lea, Dr. Fisher offered the 

 following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted : 



Resolved, That the Academy has heard with the deepest regret of the death 

 of our late esteemed Vice-President, Maj. John Le Conte, who has for so many 

 years adorned the ranks of the students of Natural Science in America, and 

 who at the time of his decease was one of the oldest naturalists in our country. 



Resolved, That Mr. John Cassin be requested to prepare a biographical notice 

 of Maj. Le Conte. 



Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to send to the family of our de- 

 ceased Vice-President a copy of these resolutions, and that they be published 

 in the daily journals of this city. 



Resolved, That the members of the Academy will meet at the Hall of the 

 Academy at 10 o'clock, A. M., on Saturday the 24th inst., to proceed from 

 thence to attend the funeral of the deceased.

 nares circular; eustachian orifices elongate oval. Tongue elongate, deeply 

 bifid. Skin of the dorsal region smooth. Tibia longer than femur ; fifth toe 

 much shorter than the fourth, and longer than the third. Length of head 

 and body 10 h lines. 



Coloration. Above pale yellowish brown (in spirits), with a light fulvous 

 band upon each side, passing from the end of the muzzle to the thigh. 

 Two bands of the same color extend one on each side of the vertebral line, 

 and passing above the eyes, become confluent on the muzzle. These bands 

 are about as wide as the spaces of ground color they enclose. Beneath, light 

 yellowish brown.

Liuperus biligonigerus Cope. 



Form very stout. Head broad, short, frontal region a little wider than 

 each palpebra. Muzzle prominent, very obtuse in profile. Canthus rostralis 

 rounded, nostrils vertico-lateral. Eyes very prominent. Tympanum con- 

 cealed ; eustachian orifices exceedingly minute. Tongue small, elliptic ob- 

 long, entire. Skin above and below very smooth, some granulations upon 

 the posterior faces of the femora. A few small glandulous elevations between 

 and posterior to the eyes, and upon the anterior part of the back. A pectoral 

 fold. Two rounded tuberosities on the carpus ; fourth digit shortest, third 

 longest. Femora very stout. Tarsus equal to the fore arm in length, fur- 

 nished with a minute, acute tubercle near the middle of its posterior face, 

 which is not brown tipped ; and at its inferior extremity with two transverse, 

 compressed tubercles or spurs, which are tipped with brown. Metatarsus not 

 tuberculous. Length of head and body measured beneath, 11 lines ; of tibia, 

 4^ lines. Breadth beneath, from axilla to axilla, 4 lines. 



Coloration. Above marbled with pale rufous brown, with darker markings 

 intermixed. These are, a narrow band bisecting each eyelid ; a blotch extend- 

 ing from eye to shoulder ; a pair of small spots upon the back, posterior to 

 the eyes ; another larger pair, one behind each suprascapular region ; one 

 upon each side of the coccyx ; a curved band extending from iliac region to 

 femur, and a lateral band extending from behind the shoulder, which 

 vanishes before reaching the thigh. A pale dorsal line, lightest posteriorly. 

 Beneath, dirty white. 



Hab. Buenos Ayres. Mus. Acad. Nat. Sci. Presented by Dr. Kennedy. 



In Liuperus marmoratus D. Sf B., the tympanum is distinct, and the 

 skin is very tuberculous. In L. sagittifer Schnu, the frontal region is 

 much narrower, and a series of tubercles extends from the eye, posteriorly. 



Tropidodipsas lunulata Cope. 



Body much compressed, its vertical diameter near the middle two and a 

 half times as great as near the neck. Tail slender, cylindrical, between one- 

 fourth and one-third the total length. Head very distinct, elongate, de-

 broader than high, its superior border rounded. Prefontals small ; post- 

 frontals large, bent upon the sides of the head. Vertical large, longer than 

 broad, its lateral borders concave. Superciliaries very large, arched ; oc- 

 cipital s rather broad, their common suture not longer than the vertical plate, 

 bounded externally by three temporals. Two temporals in contact with the 

 two postoculars. One large preocular not in contact with vertical. Loreal 

 single, not longer than high. Nasals two, the nostril between them large. 

 Superior labials nine, fourth, fifth and sixth entering the orbit. Inferior 

 labials fourteen, second to sixth very narrow ; eighth largest. Scales in 

 twenty -three rows ; anteriorly four or five, posteriorly thirteen median rows 

 weakly keeled. Gastrosteges slightly recurved upon the sides, not angu- 

 lated,*204 in number. A divided anal, urosteges 13b'. Total length 25 in. 

 3 lin. ; tail 7 in. 3 lin. 



Coloration. Ground, a light greyish rufous (tinged with yellow beneath,) 

 densely punctulated above and below, with rufous brown. The upper surface 

 is crossed by about thirty-five transverse crescent shaped, fulvous brown 

 bands, bordered with black. Upon the median line anteriorly these are one 

 or two scales wide, but become much narrower as they are prolonged obliquely 

 backward upon the sides, vanishing upon the third row of scales. Pos- 

 teriorly they are broader, and extend to a dark brown spot, which occupies 

 the ends of every third pair of gastrosteges. A short, deep brown median 

 vitta upon the neck ; a spot of the same at the posterior extremity of the 

 occipital suture, one upon each occipital, and one upon the posterior part 

 of the vertical plate. A light brown band crosses the postfrontal plates, 

 extends through the eye, and for a short distance upon the neck, involving 

 nearly the whole of the last labial shield, and the upper borders of the three 

 anterior to it. Remaining labials and throat light yellow.

 Ruse, of St. Thomas, W. I. 



Tropidodipsas Gthr. is one of the few genera of Dipsadine serpents 

 characterized by the possession of keeled scales. I have referred the present 

 species to it with some hesitation, on account of the difference between the 

 form of its head and that ofT. fasciata. Giinther states that the head of 

 the latter is shorter than that of Dipsas nebulata. In T. lunulata 

 the head is more like that of a Herpetodryas. The dentition is isodont. 



Description of a new genus and species of Amorphozoon, from the Cretaceous 



formation of New Jersey. 



BY W. M. GABB 



I received some time ago from Mr. C. C. Abbott, with some other cretaceous 

 fossils, a small fossil, that I at once referred to the Amorphozoa. I was unable 

 to decide in what genus to place it. After a careful study of the subject, I 

 am satisfied that it cannot belong to any existing genus. It is, however, 

 closely related to Siphonia of Parkinson. I propose the generic name 



Desmatocium, Gatb. 



Gen. char. Elongated, regular in form ; tubulate through the whole length ; 

 stem robust and with several inflations, but no distinct head.

Description of a new species of Cassidulus, from the Cretaceous formation 



of Alabama. 



BY AV. M. GABB. 



C. micrococcus. PL 8, fig. 1. Oval, slightly flattened, widest just 

 behind the mouth ; ambulaeral summit in advance of the centre : below 

 slightly concave ; peristome small, the channels between the tubercles very 

 narrow ; surface above minutely an I sparsely granulate ; below covered 

 with small, closely arranged tubercles, placed irregularly. 



Ripley Group, Eufala, Ala. 



This species resembles C. cequorus of Morton, but is twice or three times as 

 large ; the upper surface, which is distinctly granulate in Morton's species, is 

 apparently smooth, except under a glass, in this. Below, the tubercles on 

 this species are very small, closely and irregularly arranged. In aquorus 

 they are much larger, and placed further apart. The anal furrow does not 

 approach so near the lower margin as in cequorus.

C. Wilsonii, nobis. 



Leaf sub-orbicular or subobovate, narrowed at base, thin, plicate ; margin 

 irregular, incised, fimbriate, especially above ; fimbria stout, unequal, often 

 bifurcate, sometimes branched ; nerves numerous, thin, close, arcuate, flexu-* 

 ous, dichotomous. Rachis unknown. 



The nervation of this species, as well as the peculiar form of the fimbria, 

 separates it from C. Jimbriata, Lesq., C. laciniata, Lesq., and C. crispa, 

 nobis. Among the Neuropteris, it is most nearly allied to N. dentata, of Lesq. 

 and may possibly prove to be the cyclopteroid form of that species. In the 

 only specimen that we have seen, both of the leaves have one margin folded 

 beneath them, and are variously plicated. One leaf, only, has the basal 

 margin of one side distinct ; this part of the border is not fimbriate, but un- 

 dulate, probably, however, there will be found to be a variation in this respect. 

 It affords us much pleasure to dedicate this handsome plant to Dr. T. B. 

 Wilson, who has done so much for the advancement of natural science in 

 America.

This handsome and distinct species was discovered at Ashland, Schuylkill 

 County, Pa., by Mr. T. Guilford Smith, and by him presented to the Academy. 



L. chilalloeum, nobis. 



Leaf scar sub-oval, elongate and acuminate above and below, often com- 

 municating one with another ; margins distinct, broad, alternately contracted 

 and enlarged for half the length of the scar ; vascular scar sub-rhomboidal, 

 their transverse diameter very much exceeding their height, (sometimes four 

 times as great); internal markings and appendices obsolete ; medial line, above 

 the vascular scar, well marked and furnished with a triangular depression, 

 below, almost obsolete, but crossed by a number of heavy transverse wrinkles. 



The form of the ribs ally this plant to L. dicrochilum, nobis, but the 

 internal markings as well as shape of main scar widely separate it from that 

 species. 



L. salebrosum, nobis. 



Leaf scar rhomboidal, uneven ; margin heavy, raised, irregularly plicate, 

 quite flexuous ; angles sometimes rounded, sometimes acute ; medial vascular 

 cicatrix sub-central, small, in one scar in our specimen marked with two 

 very much raised lines, in the form of a cross, (this may be accidental) ; ap- 

 pendices and medial line obsolete. 



Cabinet of the Academy. Locality unkown. 



L. uraeum, nobis. 



Scars elliptical, very much elongate, caudate and slightly curved above and 

 below, impressed with flexuous transverse wrinkles disposed with some ap- 

 proach to regularity ; margin raised, very narrow, almost linear ; vascular 

 scar sub-rhomboidal or snbtriangular, (in the one case having the basal angle 

 acute, in the other, the base merely convex, remaining angles being mostly 

 obtuse), situated a little above the centre of the main scar, impressed with 

 three dots arranged in a curve near its base ; medial line not very distinct, but 

 running the whole length of the leaf scar above the cicatriculus smooth and 

 furnished with a triangular expansion approaching in size to the vascular scar 

 below the cicatriculus crossed by many heavy transverse flexuous wrinkles ; 

 appendices subdistinct, irregularly curved and of considerable length ; tuber- 

 cles oval, elongate, somewhat acuminate, situated at base of vascular scar, 

 "and close to the medial line. 



In our specimen the total length of the leaf scar is 2 9-10ths inches, being five 

 times as great as its breadth. The vascular scar is placed somewhat obliquely in 

 the main scar. At the extremities of the latter, the two margins are so ap- 

 proximated as to be merely separated by a groove. This species is, perhaps, 

 closely allied to L. caudatum, Ung. We have never seen Sternberg's 

 figure of that plant, and Unger's description is excessively meagre : but out of 

 the few given characters our specimen differs in the great rugosity of the medial 

 line, as well as in the obtuseness of the angles of the cicatriculus. We may 

 be mistaken in our idea as to the relationship of the two plants, as Unger's 

 description leaves one so much in the dark.

Phytolithus notatus, Steinh., S. elliptica, Brong. S. atcenuata, Lesq. 



We see no character on which Prof. Lesquereux's species can be separated. 

 He says: "This species, viz. figs. 1 and 2, could perhaps be referred to 

 S. elliptica, Brgt. and viz. fig. 3, to S. Sillimanii, Brgt. But the form of the scars 

 in figs, one and two is broader and shorter than in the varieties of S. elliptica. 

 The author (Brongt.) says that ' S. elliptica has the scars only half as broad 

 as the ribs, whilst in our species they fill nearly the whole breadth.' ' After- 

 wards, when reconciling the three varieties together, he says, " But it must 

 be remarked with Artis (Anted. Phytol.) that the distance between the scars 

 of the leaves, as also the breadth of the ribs, is variable on the same tree. 

 The ribs enlarge towards the base of the tree and the scars become broader 

 and nearer together." Now is not this argument as applicable to the identity 

 of S. elliptica and S. attenuata, as to that of the three varieties of the latter. 

 which certainly differ as much, if not more, from one another, than from the 

 different forms of 5. elliptica ? The most important character separating the 

 two ? species, as given by the Professor, is the difference in the pro- 

 portion of the width of scars to that of ribs. The breadth of the scars in his 

 first variety is certainly very great, but in au English specimen (which we 

 doubt not was Steinhauer's type) now in possession of the Academy, the 

 breadth of the scars bears a proportion to that of the ribs almost as great 

 as in Lesquereux's second fig. and much greater than in his third variety. 

 Some of the varieties of S- elliptica, Brongt., figured by Groldenberg, (Flor. 

 Saraepont. Fossil.) also scarcely differ in this respect from the second form 

 of S. attenuata, and have the breadth greater than in the third variety. The 

 Professor remarks : " The reason for admitting these three specimens as three 

 forms of the same species are ;******, and that they have the 

 same general form of scars, ribs, and furrows ; the same disposition of scars of 

 the vessels either upon their naked surface or the corticated narrow striated 

 portion." These are the very reasons which have influenced us in uniting 

 the different forms; the specimens in the foreign collection of the Academy 

 possessing these characters in common with Lesquereux's plates. We have 

 elsewhere shown that S. e'liptica, of Brongt., is synonymous with Phytol. 

 parmatus, of Steiuhauer, and that S. notata, Br., (if it is a good species) is not, 

 and therefore propose to call the latter S. Brongniartii. 



Sub-genus Syringodendkon, St. 

 S. bistriata, nobis. 



Stem ecostate ; bark thin, striate ; stria very numerous, flexuous, occurring 

 in two forms, the one deep and strongly marked, the other small and straighter ; 

 scars sub-rotund, disposed in pairs about eight lines apart, very small. 



When decorticated, the scars are very elongate, often pyriform, and the 

 stria? very numerous, small and less flexuous.

BOMBYCID^. 



Oylothrix. 



Fore wings with the tip and inner angle rounded ; inner margin about one- 

 half as long as the exterior ; hind margin entire, very oblique ; woolly toward 

 the base, with the hairs curled. The subcostal vein sends off two marginal 

 nervules from the cell, one near its superior angle and the other above the 

 origin of the discal vein. Exterior to the cell it becomes 3-branched ; giving 

 off the apical nervule first near the second marginal and immediately 

 subdividing into post-apical and subcosto-inferior. The disco-central arises 

 from the middle of the angulated discal vein. The median is 4-branched, the 

 posterior arising about the middle of the cell and the branches equidistant, 

 except the medio-discal and superior. The fold of the wing is thickened. 

 Submedian vein furcate at the base, with a branch to inner margin in the 

 basal third of the wings. Hind wings longer than the abdomen, smooth, 

 without costal vein, and bristle and socket. The subcostal vein is bifid, in- 

 distinctly furcate at its base, its lower branch giving rise to the discal vein, 

 which is slightly angulated beneath the origin of the disco-central nervule. 

 Median vein 4-branched, the posterior arising about the middle of the cell. 



Head small, rather impacted on the thorax, not depressed, without ocelli. 

 Face extremely narrow; eyes small and round. Antenna?, basal joint slight- 

 ly tufted, the stalk simple from the base to the middle, and thence to the tip 

 with extremely short pectinations ; about as long as the thorax. Labial palpi 

 cylindric, very short. Tongue wanting. Thorax thick, with long, rather 

 erected silky hairs. Abdomen pilose, without apical tuft, and the legs very 

 hairy, even to the tips of the tarsi ; posterior tibise with two extremely short 

 apical spurs. 



0. salebrosa . Fawn color. Face, labial palpi and breast beneath the 

 mouth dark brown. Antennae grayish. Thorax with whitish hairs on the 

 disk in front, and a pencil of the same on each side behind teguhe. Along 

 the base of the nervules of the fore wings is a rather broad grayish space, ex- 

 tending from the costa almost to the inner margin, with each of the nervules 

 marked on both sides by a short brown line, while the nervules are grayish. 

 The inner streak of the subcosto-inferior nervuh' is blackish brown, and on the 

 discal vein is a streak of the same hue. In the space between the median 

 and submedian veins the wing is reddish brown, mixed with blackish, with 

 two blackish points extended into the grayish space on each side of the thick- 

 ener! fold. Hind wings concolorous, pale luteous. Legs with whitish hairs, 

 tarsi black.

The wings of the specimen described are badly denuded from the disk to 

 the costa, yet the markings given above are sufficiently distinct and charac- 

 teristic to indicate the insect hereafter. The genus belongs to the family 

 Bombycidae.

 Ecpantheria, Hiibner. 



Fore wings about one-third longer than the hind wings, with the subcostal 

 vein having a single marginal branch from the cell and another midway be- 

 tween the post-apical and inferior nervules ; the latter arises a little exterior 

 to the discal vein and the former midway between th<^ apical nervulet and the 

 second marginal. The median vein is 4-branched, with the posterior moder- 

 ately remote from the penultimate. Hind wings as long as the abdomen, 

 with the interior sometimes dilated and rather caudate ; neuration arctiae- 

 form. 



Head small, depressed, smooth ; without ocelli. Face moderate, retreating. 

 Eyes rather small. Antennae serrated in the rj 1 , simple in the Labial 

 palpi short, not extending beyond the clypeus, rather stout and porrected ; 

 middle joint short, terminal joint very small. Tongue rather thick, slightly 

 longer than the anterior coxae. 



Body stout. Thorax globose, smooth, with scales. Patagia erected, over- 

 lapping the front of mesothorax, nearly square. Breast and abdomen smooth.

 the hind wings, which are occasionally nearly wholly pale brown. 



Honduras, S. America. 



Arachnis, Hubner. 



Fore wings nearly one-third longer than the hinder pair, much longer than 

 the body. The subcostal vein forms a small costal cell, immediately behind 

 the origin of the discal vein, and gives rise to a marginal nervule which sends 

 off, near its middle, a short nervulet to the costa ; near the tip of the wing it 

 sends off the post-apical nervule and behind it becomes bifid. The subcosto- 

 inferior arises on a short stalk common to it and the discal vein. The median 

 is 4-branched, the medio-posterior being very remote from the penultimate 

 branch. Hind wings about equal to the abdome'n, broader than th anterior 

 pair, with neuration as usual in the family. 



Female. Head quite small, somewhat depressed, smooth ; with ocelli. 

 Face moderately broad, slightly inclined. Eyes very small. Antennae simple. 

 Labial palpi rather short, scarcely extending beyond the clypeus, but slightly 

 curved and ascending, and slightly hairy beneath ; third joint short. Tongue 

 exceeding the tips of labial palpi by one-half its length.

gray. Antennae black, whitish at the base. Labial palpi crimson, with 

 whitish hairs beneath. Head with a pale yellowish white band in front, above 

 the eyes, black-margined beneath, and a black circle between the antennae. 

 Patagia each with a black circle on their edges, and a pale yellowish white 

 stripe on the sides of thorax from the head to the base of fore wings. Tegulae 

 with two black-marginal lines, and the disk of thorax with a central line of 

 the same hue, and one on each side of it that corresponds to the upper one on 

 the tegulae. Fore wings with six irregular, oblique, pale yellowish white 

 streaks along the costa, bordered with black lines, with a black spot on the 

 disk beneath the third band. Beneath the median vein the wing is veined 

 with black lines enclosing pale yellowish white spaces, and between the 

 nervules on the hinder margin is a series of streaks of the same hue, black- 

 margined. Hind wings black, crimson toward the base, with a macular band, 

 of the same hue about the middle of the wing and one on the hinder margin. 

 On the under surface of both pairs of wings all the spots are crimson. Ab- 

 domen with a dark brown central band widening from the base and margined 

 with black, with a band on each side, crimson from the base to the middle 

 and thence to the tip luteous. Breast whitish, with a dark brown circle on 

 each anterior coxae, which are tinted with crimson internally. All the femora 

 crimson internally ; tarsi annulated with crimson. 



Unless Mr. Walker's description refers to this insect, I think it has not been 

 described since the time of Hubner. I have recognized the genus under which 

 this author placed it, because I regard the insect as distinct generically from 

 Ecpantheria. The two genera are, however, beyond doubt nearly related, 

 while at the same time the neuration of the wings shows close relationship to 

 the genus Arctia. 



Mexico, near Jalapa. 



Arctia, Schrank. 



Fore wings with the subcostal nervure having two marginal nervules from 

 near the end of the cell, and with a long, narrow costal cell formed between 

 the pecond marginal and subcostal vein, and extended a little beyond the 

 origin of the post-apical, or without this cell. The subcosto-inferior nervule 

 and the discal vein arises at a common point, and toward the apical portion 

 of the wing is given off the post-apical nervule and the apical nervulet. The 

 median vein 4-branched, the posterior nervule being very remote from the 

 others. Hind wings broader than the fore wings, as long or rather longer ; 

 neuration as usual in the family. Sometimes the neuration of the fore wings 

 varies from that of the typical species, in having a single marginal nervule from 

 the cell and another between the origins of the post-apical nervule and apical 

 nervulet, thus resembling the wing structure in Spilosoma ; in the latter, how- 

 ever, the second marginal arises on the interior side of the post-apical. 



Head small, rather sunken on thorax, hairy, and with ocelli. Face narrow 

 and hairy. Eyes small. Antennae in the j* shortly pectinated, in the? 

 serrated and sometimes slightly pectinated. Labial palpi porrected, hairy 

 and exceeding the clypeus by about one-half their length ; the third joint 

 subacuate, nearly or quite as long as the second joint. Tongue with slender 

 filaments, as long as the anterior coxae. 



Body thick. Thorax covered with thick hair. Patagia rather large, more 

 or less overarching the vertex. Breast rather hairy ; legs rather stout, with 

 all the femora hairy ; anterior tibiae longer than last joint of tarsus, with 

 tibial spur concealed, the posterior tibiae having four moderate spurs.

Hypantria, Harris. 



Mr. Walker does not recognize this genus, but refers the species Dr. Harris 

 placed in it to Euproctis of Hiibner. The structure of E. auriflua does 

 not, however, authorize this step. In it the antennas are deeply pectinated 

 in the $, the palpi are differently formed, the tongue more rudimentary, the 

 costal and subcostal veins in the hind wings distinct to the base, although 

 connected in the middle of the cell by an intercostal branch, and in the fore 

 wings the second subcosto-marginal nervule arises between the post-apical 

 and apical nervulet. The head is without ocelli and the structure of the legs 

 in auriflua differs from that intextor. A consideration of these differ- 

 ences and the structural agreement of t e x t o r with other genera of the 

 family Arctiidae, the habits and structure of the larva can leave no doubt, I 

 think, respecting its true position and the naturalness of the genus.

Mass., Samuel H. Scudder, Esq. New York, Mr. Akhurst. 



The following insect differs from the Massachusetts specimen very curious- 

 ly, and I am at a loss how to reconcile the differences between them. The 

 fore wings correspond more nearly to Dr. Harris' description than the speci- 

 men from his own State, but the palpi do not agree witli those of the species 

 he described. The larva of E. E g 1 e is common enough in this vicinity, but 

 I have never met with the perfect insect, nor have I been successful in various 

 attempts to carry it through its transformations. 



In the Texan specimens the costal cell of the fore wings is longer and nar- 

 rower than in the foregoing, and sometimes gives rise to the post-apical ner- 

 vule. The head is perfectly smooth ; the palpi are porrected, short; scarcely ex- 

 ceeding the ciypeus ; rather hairy towards the base beneath ; the basal and 

 middle joints nearly equal ; terminal joint globular, and one-half as long as 

 the middle. 



The body is rather slender. Thorax and breast perfectly smooth. Legs 

 smooth; anterior tibia? scarcely longer than the basal joint of the anterior

 bright red orange, with a dorsal row of small black spots and one on each 

 side ; beneath cinereous. The thorax beneath and the anterior coxae are 

 tinged with red orange. 



The imago is on wing during the month of August.

The following insect greatly resembles Americana in appearance and 

 almost exactly in ornamentation. It must, however, be very distinct from it. 

 The wings are extremely narrow. Hind wings broader than the fore wings, 

 less ovate than in Americana, and rounded at the interior basal angle ; 

 length rather more than thai of the body. The disk of the fore wings is closed by 

 a rather faint, irregularly oblique vein, with one disco-central nervule, and an-

 with the posterior nervule and the marginal opposite at their origins. The 

 fold is thickened and the submedian vein simple. In the hind wings the sub- 

 costal vein shows a tendency to separate into two veins from its point of bi- 

 furcation towards the base of the wing and resemhling two veins crossing each 

 other ; exterior to the point of bifurcation and a little behind the middle of 

 the lower branch arises a decided, curved discal vein which receives, just above 

 the medio-superior nervule, a decided or thickened discal fold. The median 

 vein is 4- branched, with the two posterior branches equidistant from the 

 second one.

Ckocota, Hiibner. 



Fore wings rather broad, trigonate. The subcostal vein, almost above pos- 

 terior end of the disk, gives rise to a single marginal nervule, and the apical 

 branch is trifid at the tip ; and sometimes with a second short marginal branch

 nal black band, sometimes absent, and sometimes with a dark brown discal 

 dot.

 wings 8 10 lines. 



I have specimens which correspond very nearly to the above description. 

 The anterior portion of the body is luteous, as are the fore wings, but com- 

 bined with a reddish hue. Hind wings cinnabar red, without marginal band 

 or discal spot, and in one specimen the terminal joint of the palpi is blackish.

C. ferruginosa , Walker, 535. Ferruginous. Abdomen pale ferruginous, 

 with a row of dorsal black dots. Hind wings pale ferruginous, with a blackish 

 dot in the disk, and two or three blackish spots along the border. Length of 

 the body 3J 4 lines ; of the wings 1011 lines. 



It is possible this insect may be the rubricosa of Harris. I have specimens 

 which agree in general with Mr. Walker's description, but they possess 

 noticeable differences in structure as compared with the others described pre- 

 viously. In these the tongue is rudimentary ; fore wings with a second marginal 

 branch in the middle of the apical nervule. In every other particular the struc- 

 ture conforms to that of the genus. These differences may be sexual. In 

 ornamentation they are reddish brown, scarcely ferruginous, and in addition 

 to the discal dot, have a rather faint dark brownish band crossing the nervules. 

 Hind wings rather paler than the fore wings, one specimen with a blackish 

 discal spot, the other without it, and faint blackish spots along the margin 

 near the inner angle. 



My own impression is that rubicundaria of Hiibner and rubricosa of Harris 

 is a variable insect, and that ferruginosa of Walker, and perhaps brevicornis, are 

 not true species. I am much more uncertain, however, respecting the latter 

 than the former.

NunAKiA ? Haw., Steph. 



Wings rather broad, semi-diaphanous, rounded. In the fore wings the sub- 

 costal vein forms a large subcostal cell over the discal vein, giving rise about 

 the middle of the cell above to a marginal nervule, and beneath to the sub- 

 costo- inferior and discal vein, the latter having a disco-central nervule. At 

 the apex of the cell behind, the vein becomes trifid, dividing into a marginal, 

 post-apical and apical nervules, the latter with a nervulet from its middle. 

 Hind wings about equal to the body in length ; without costal vein ; subcostal 

 vein with a marginal nervule arising from the disk near the discal vein, and 

 becoming bifid exteriorly at a point remote from the discal vein ; with a disco- 

 central nervule. Median 3-branched, with the posterior nervule somewhat 

 interior to the origin of the marginal nervule.

 larva in escaping from the egg is geometriform, with ten legs. This refers to 

 the species described below which differs sufficiently in structure from the 

 European N. m u n d a n a , it appears to me to authorise the separation of our 

 species from the group containing the European species. It may belong to the 

 Geomettina.

The wings are longer than the body. The anterior rather narrow, envelop- 

 ing the body when folded ; apex obtusely rounded and hind margin slightly 

 oblique. The subcostal nervule gives rise to a marginal nervule, about its 

 middle, and within the disk forms a large secondary cell, from the hind end 

 of which arise three distinct marginal nervules, the lower one reaching the 

 costa rather above the tip. The disk extends rather beyond the apical third 

 of the wing, and the discal vein gives rise to three nervules. The median is 

 3 -branched, the posterior branch being remote from the others and arising op-

posite the origin of the subcostal branch, which forms the secondary cell. 

 The fold is thickened, and the subinedian furcate at its base. The hind wings 

 are rather broader than tbe fore wings ; obliquely rounded along the hind mar- 

 gin from the tip to the base ; costa nearly straight. The costal nervure dis- 

 tinct and simple : the subcostal simple and rather attenuated from the discal 

 vein towards the base. The discal vein gives rise to two nervules, and sends 

 a false nervule through the disk towards the base of the wing. The median 

 subdivides into three equidistant nervules. 



Head rather small, smooth, free ; without ocelli. Face rather narrow, 

 tapering, vertical. Eyes small, salient. Antennae slender, with joints closely 

 set, serrated beneath with scales. Palpi slender cylindrical, curved, ascending 

 rather above the middle of the front ; basal joint squamose ; middle and ter- 

 minal joints smooth and equal in length. Tongue about one half as long as 

 the body. 



Body slender, scarcely equal in length to the fore wings. Patagia scale-like. 

 Abdomen slender, more than one half as long as the body beneath. Legs 

 smooth and slender ; fore tibiae with a long, concealed internal spur ; hind 

 tibiae with a pair of apical spurs. 



The wing structure of the insect included in this genus resembles most 

 strikingly that of the Tineina, and must form a group connecting the Glauco- 

 pidipse directly with it. 



P. compta . Palpi pale yellow, with the ends of the second and third 

 joints black. Head yellow, with a black spot between the antennae and a 

 black band across the face. Thorax reddish orange, with two black spots in 

 front ; neck yellow, edged behind with blackish. Fore wings reddish orange, 

 with four bluish black patches placed transversely on the wing and containing 

 yellow spots ; the first at the base ; the second interior to the middle of the 

 wing ; the third exterior to the middle, constricted toward the costa and con- 

 nected behind with the subterminal patch, which is constricted in the middle. 

 The hind wings are slightly hyaline ; dark brown.

 Texana. As Major Le Conte has already described a species as Hickorea ( Carya) 

 Texana, and by a comparison of Buckley's description with Le Conte's, (see 

 Proceedings, 1853, ) it is evident that they are two distinct species, is it not 

 worth having the error corrected?" 



Mr. D. agreed fully with Mr. Meehan, and proposed the substitution of 

 Carya Buckleyi for the name of Texana, given by Dr. Buckley, and already 

 occupied.

 Part 4, Vol. iv. of the Journal. 



Mr. Lea read the following letter from Mr. Marcou : 



Boston, 26th Nov., 1860. 



At the end of the " Proceedings" for 1859, there is a Catalogue of the Fossils of 

 the Cretaceous Formation of the United States, by Mr. Wm. M. Gabb, where I see 

 placed the Ostrea Marshii aud Gryphcea dilatata, var. Tucumcarii, found by me in 

 the Jurassic strata of Pyramid Mount in New Mexico. Mr. Gabb ought, I think, 

 in thus placing these fossils, at least to have mentioned in a note that I have 

 placed them in the Jurassic formation of the United States. 



In a notice of Geological Discoveries made by Capt. J. H. Simpson, by Messrs. 

 Meek and Engelmann, published in April, I860, "Proceedings," page 126, 1 observe 

 a paragraph entitled Jurassic Rocks, where they have found a Gryphma probably 

 identical with G. calceola, Quenstedt, and a plicated oyster closely allied to Os- 

 trea Marshii, in the strata of the Utah Territory, where, since 1854 I have indi- 

 cated the existence of the Jurassic Formation. Notwithstanding that Messrs. 

 Meek and Engelmann say that this species of Ostrea Marshii is distinct from the 

 species of Mr. Marcou, and notwithstanding the probable identity of Gryphcea 

 calceola, I do not doubt that Mr. Engelmann has found in Utah, at Ducherne 

 river and at Weber river, the Gryphcea dilatata, var. Tucumcarii, and the Ostrea 

 Marshii indicated by me in the Jurassic rocks of Pyramid Mount. These two 

 fossils are tco numerous around the Tucumcari Mountains, north of the Llano 

 Estacado, not to be distributed over other parts of the plateau which surrounds 

 the Rocky Mountains. The Gryphcea calceola of Quenstedt is very closely allied 

 to Gryphcea dilatata, and with many geologists it is considered but a variety. 

 Dr. B. F. Shumard, in " Observations upon the Cretaceous Strata of Texas {Trans. 

 Acad, of Sci., St. Louis, p. 587,) maintains that my Ostrea Marshii of Pyramid 

 Mount is identical with his Ostrea subovata from Fort Washita, and that my 

 Gryphcea dilatata, var. Tucumcarii, is found at Fort Washita, in strata two hun- 

 dred feet above beds that contain well-marked cretaceous types. The question 

 to resolve is, actually to give a detailed section of Fort Washita, with plates of 

 fossils, as 1 have done for Pyramid Mount, to do the same for the strata of Utah 

 Territory, and compare the three localities. Then we shall see if Washita is 

 identical with Pyramid Mount and with Utah, or if Pyramid Mount and Utah 

 are identical, and different from Washita. 



Mr. Gabb remarked that, while he strongly deprecated anything like the 

 unfortunate discussions that have taken place on the above subject, he still 

 considered that the candid expression of the views of persons holding a differ- 

 ence of opinion on scientific points, was the only way to arrive at the facts. 

 The omission of the note, in regard to the position to which Prof. Marcou 

 referred these species, was accidental, and not an intentional slight, as Prof. 

 M. seems to imply. 



Nevertheless, the species are not, in his opinion, identical with the species 

 bearing the same names in Europe. As far as can be determined, Ostrea 



[December, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 549 



Marshii, Marcou, is not 0. Marshii, Sow., and therefore the name 0. subovata, 

 Shumard, is the real name of the species. Gryphcea Tucumcarii, M., is at 

 least as nearly related to the typical specimens of G. Pitcherii, Morton, now in 

 the Museum of the Academy, as the forms referred to Pitcherii by Marcou, 

 and known to geologists as var. navis. The specimen from the plains of 

 Kiamesha, mentioned by Morton, is more nearly of the shfpe of Tucumcarii. 

 than the one figured, but no palaeontologist would hesitate for a moment in 

 pronouncing thm identical. 



In regard to the real position of these species, Dr. Shumard, in Marcy's Re- 

 port on the Red River of Louisiana, places 0. subovata, on the same horizon 

 with G. Pitcherii and Ammonites vespertinus, both of which species are, mother 

 parts of the United States, found associated with species that are everywhere 

 characteristic of the chalk, such as Baculites anceps, Gryphcea vesicularis, 

 Ostrea larva, Exogyra Matheroniana, of D'Orbigny, (or E. Texana, Roemer,) 

 Nautilus Dekayi and other species, not only found in the United States, but in 

 Europe, Chili and India, and never found outside of the Upper Chalk of Eng- 

 lish authors, the Senonien of the French. 



Mr. Gabb did not pretend to deny the existence of the older members of 

 the cretaceous formation in North America, but said, that outside of the 

 evidence in "Geology of North America," founded only on the doubtful re- 

 cognition of two or three species of Ammonites from weathered fragments, all 

 the testimony yet collected tends to prove the existence only of the Upper 

 Chalk, unless, perhaps, some of the lower beds (Nos. 1 and 2) of Nebraska 

 may prove, as he thinks probable, to belong to the Lower Chalk of the Eng- 

 lish, the Turonien of continental writers. Still the evidence is only negative. 

 True, the beds of New Jersey cannot be distinguished lithologically from the 

 green sand of England and France, but even Prof. Marcou would not now 

 have the temerity to call them upper green sand or even "Turonien " in face 

 of the palasontological evidence to the contrary ; and yet, lithological evidence 

 is among the strongest brought to bear on his Jurassic and Triassic of the 

 West. That Jurassic and Triassic rocks do exist on this continent is now 

 beyond doubt, but that Jurassic and Triassic, is not the Jurassic and Triassic 

 of Marcou. That Ostrea Marshii has been found in the far West, associated 

 with Ammonites cordatus, it is no evidence that the 0. Marshii of Prof. Marcou 

 is the 0. Marshii, Sow. 



In conclusion, he remarked that in the above opinions he was upheld by 

 every American geologist who has investigated the subject. 



Mr. Cope read the following list of the recent species of Emydosaurian rep- 

 tiles represented in the museum of the Academy.

In all, twelve species, represented by thirty-eight specimens. 



Osteolaemds, Cope, was characterized as a genus of Crocodiles presenting 

 several points of analogy to the Alligators. The nasal bones were prolonged 

 anteriorly, and uniting with the short spine of the intermaxillary, divided the 

 external nasal orifice, as in the genus Alligator. The eyelids were entirely os- 

 seous, as in Caiman. There was no transverse bony ridge between the orbits. 

 The dermal plates upon the tail, extremities, and thorax, were more or less com- 

 pletely ossified ; upon the gular region the ossification was most complete, the 

 shields having a coarse sutural articulation. The digits of the posterior ex- 

 tremity were very slightly webbed. Cervical plates distinct from the dorsal.

550 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OE 



Two specimens were exhibited ; one, a skin brought from the Ogobai River, 

 "Western Africa, by Mr. P. B. Du Chaillu ; the other, the skull of a half-grown 

 individual, obtained from the Museum of the Pennsylvania University. These 

 jMr. Cope regarded as belonging to a species hitherto unknown, and which he 

 proposed calling Osteolaemus tetraspis. He briefly characterized it as fol- 

 lows : Proportions of the head somewhat similar to those of Crocodilus 

 trigonops, Gray, of India. Breadth of muzzle at ninth tooth equal to the 

 distance between the external nasal orifice and anterior border of the orbit, and 

 to the width of the table of the cranium posteriorly. A short ridge in front of 



17 

 each orbit, directed obliquely inward. Teeth , rather compressed. Four 



15 

 nuchal shields, in a single transverse series ; four cervical, in pairs. Dorsal 

 shields in sir rows. Posterior extremities without fringe. Total length of 

 the entire specimen, five feet. 



Mr. Cope alluded to the remarkable extent to which ossification was carried 

 in this species. The cranium was much more rugose and pitted than in the 

 adult, specimens of much larger species, and the crotaphite foramina were roofed 

 over by bone. The latter peculiarity was sometimes observed in the genera 

 Jacare and Caiman. The osseous gular and thoracic buckler was also similar 

 to that exhibited by those genera, and by the extinct "Crocodilus" Hast- 

 ing s i ae , the existence of which has been shown by Professor Huxley. And 

 alluding to the numerous points of analogy to the Alligatorial or American type, 

 Mr. Cope mentioned the occurrence of South American forms of tree-snakes 

 in Western Africa; e. g. Dryophis Kirt 1 a n di i andThrasops f 1 a vigulari s. 

 Ilallowell. 



Mecistops bathyrhynchus was the name by which Mr. Cope proposed to 

 characterize a species, of which a large skull was in the Academy's museum. 

 This skull was of a very elongate form ; on this account, and from the fact that 

 the nasal bones disappeared some distance posterior to the external nasal ori- 

 fice, he concluded that it belonged to Mecistops, Gray, although that genus 

 was mainly characterized by the position of the cervical dermal shields. 

 The breadth of the muzzle at the tenth tooth was twice that at. the notch, and 

 was contained two and half times in the space between the orbit and nasal ori- 

 fice. The length of the muzzle anterior to the tenth tooth equalled the length 

 posterior to that point, plus three-fourths the length of the orbit. The latter 

 was scarcely larger than the external nasal orifice. The width of the table of 

 the cranium posteriorly, entered into the total length, measured from the pos- 

 terior border of the former, four times; was equal to the length of the symphy- 

 sis mandibuli ; was greater than the width of the muzzle measured across the 

 palate between the twelfth and thirteenth teeth, and was exactly twice the width 

 of the os frontis. The snout was more rounded and elevated than in the known 

 species of Mecistops ; the superiormaxillaryboneatitsposteriorextremity formed 

 a perpendicular wall. The length of the ramus of the inferior maxillary from 

 the angle, was thirty-two inches, the symphysis extending one-fifth the distance.

Mr. Cope stated that in the present species the muzzle was less depressed, 

 and more rounded laterally than in the species of Crocodilus; also that the 

 fourth and tenth teeth above, and fourth below, were of proportionally large size. 



Mr. Lea read two letters from Prof. Tyson, State Geologist of Maryland, in 

 relation to some remarkable infusorial beds of Tripoli, observed by him in 

 Maryland. The specimens were presented to the Academy: 



No. 1 is from a bluff on the Patuxent, below Lyon's Creek, the bed being 

 three feet thick, overlying the green sand. 



No. 2 is from a bluff two miles below Nottingham, the thickness ten feet. 



[Dee. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 551 



No. 3 is from " Holland's Cliffs," three miles south of " Lower Marlboro 1 ' 

 and is thirty feet thick. 



No. 4 is from the " Cove," on the south side of Herring Bay, eight miles 

 east of Nos. 1 and 2, 



Prof. Tyson has traced this " Tripoli region " from near the head of West 

 River, in Anne Anindel County, twenty-five miles southward, to Prince Frederick, 

 in Clavert County, It may be found to extend eighteen or twenty miles further 

 south, to near the lower end of Calvert County. It is well exposed in high 

 cliffs on the Patuxent, as well as on the Chesapeake Bay. It probably extends 

 over most of Charles County, and of the southern part of Prince George County. 



It belongs to the Miocene period, and rests upon the most important fossil 

 shell bed of the Tertiary region. Prof. Tyson states that Dr. C. Johnson has 

 made out more than one hundred forms of Diatoms in No. 3. 



Dr. Fisher exhibited a stereoscopic picture of a parasitical insect, 

 taken by means of a new and ingenious arrangement of the ordinary 

 microscope, by Dr. R, E. Griffith. The insect was magnified between

for the reason, apparently, that it has a somewhat musical voice. It is the 

 only Humming Bird which to my knowledge has any notes which are sufficient 

 to recognize it by in the woods, and though rather monotonous, are quite 

 pleasing. 



In the neighborhood of Jalapa this species is found occasionally, but in the 

 above-mentioned place is more abundant, although very difficult to obtain. 

 It inhabits the forest in the winter season, and generally feeds on the flowers 

 of high bushes called Asasaretos, which at that season are in full bloom and 

 densely covered with beautiful smooth emerald green leaves, amongst which 

 it is very difficult to see this bird, though it often betrays itself by its musical 

 notes, especially in the morning. The males, I think, only sing, or at least 

 much more than the females. 



Very few specimens of this kind are seen in summer time in this neighbor- 

 hood. It is found also near Cordova, and goes as far south as Guatemala, where 

 perhaps it builds its nest, for I have never seen nor heard of a nest being found 

 here. 



The general appearance of this species is as follows : the upper part of the 

 head is beautiful metallic ultramarine color. Wing coverts and tail coverts, 

 and upper part of the body bronze green. Throat, under wing coverts, breast 

 and belly, iron gray color, and the under tail coverts the same, but tinged with 

 chestnut. Quills purplish black with the vanes black and resembling whale- 

 bone, the three principle ones rather wider than common. Tail feathers yel- 

 lowish bronze green, all except the two central, with the half towards the 

 point bluish black, three on each side tipped with chestnut iron gray. The feet 

 are dark iron gray, nails and upper mandible black, under mandible iron gray. 

 Its size from the point of the bill to the tip of the tail is from 5 to 5f inches, 

 wing 2|, tail 2, bill 1^ inches. The female is almost precisely like the male, 

 with the difference of about f of an inch in size, and either less blue or with 

 it less brilliant on the top of the head.

This species of Humming Bird is one of the rarest that is found in Mexico. 

 It is small, very beautiful, and possesses wonderful rapidity of flight, moving 

 its wings with such velocity that it is almost impossible to see them when 

 flying, and it may easily be mistaken for a large bee on account of the strange 

 buzzing sound produced by their incessant motion. In the vicinity of Jalapa 

 this bird is called Mirto de colo de tisera, or the shear-tailed Myrtle-sucker. 



This Humming Bird is extremely shy, and differs in its habits and manner 

 of living from other species. It rises very early in the morning, and the few 

 specimens that have come under my observation I never saw after seven or 

 eight o'clock in the morning, and again about five o'clock in the afternoon 

 until dark ; in the intermediate time I have never seen it. When once this 

 bird is found eating at one place it is almost sure to be found there at the same 

 hour for several days in succession, so that once failing to obtain it, all that is 

 necessary is to wait for it the next day. It feeds on the Masapan and Tobaco 

 flowers, I think preferring the latter. 



This bird is found also at the Barrancas de Jico (or Precipices of Jico) about 

 twenty miles from Jalapa ; there it builds its nest, which I have seen. It is 

 very small, round, and flat on the bottom, neither so deep nor so thick on the 

 lower part as the generality of other Humming Birds. The eggs are two, 

 rather long in proportion to their diameter. The nest is covered on the out- 

 side with moss from stones, and lined inside with tule or cattail silky floss.

In this bird the upper part of the head, the wing coverts, tail coverts, and 

 the upper part of the body are bright yellowish green bronze, except on the 

 top of the head, which is rather duller. The throat is beautiful metallic 

 shining amethyst color. The breast forming a kind of band across and com- 

 municating in a faint line on each side of the neck with the corner of the eye, 

 is white, slightly tinged with chestnut. The flanks, legs and lower part of 

 the belly are of the same color. The sides of the body under the wings are 

 mixed, scale-like, with bronze, green and chestnut color. The quills are pur- 

 plish gray black, the tail bright purplish black, the second and third feathers 

 having edges of light chestnut, not reaching to the point, and giving them the 

 appearance of being spatulate in form. The tail is composed of six feathers, two 

 on each side about the same length, and the third about one-third shorter. 

 The feet, nails, and bill are black. The bill is considerably curved. Total 

 length 3| inches, wing 1^, tail H, bill f . 



The female is like the male in the color of the upper parts of the body. The 

 throat and breast and abdomen are grayish white, tinged with chestnut, very 

 pale on the last, sides under the wings light chestnut, mixed with bronze 

 green towards the breast. The tail feathers are ten, light chestnut in their 

 half towards the body, and the terminal half black, with the first and second 

 widely tipped with white, and the third slightly. The middle feathers are 

 bronze green. The female is about one-eighth of an inch shorter than the 

 male.

We would direct the attention of herpetologists who have large suits of spe- 

 cimens of this species at their command, to the variations in the relative 

 lengths of the tail and body. In our specimens from Madras and Ceylon, the 

 length of the former is to that of the latter, about as one to two ; in the speci- 

 men presented by Dr. Burrough, as one and one-third to two. In the latter, 

 the lateral and superior surfaces of the proboscis are verrucose, and the body 

 13 more slender in proportion to its length.

In this genus the scales are arranged in subtransverse rows, and are cari- 

 nate ; in Philothamnus Smith, they are similarly arranged and smooth ; in both 

 genera the gastrosteges are weakly keeled, the urosteges scarcely at all. In Gas- 

 tropyxis nobis, the scales are arranged quincuncially and are keeled ; thegastro- 

 and urosteges sharply angulated. In all three the dentition is syncranterian. 

 In Hapsidophrys, Fisch., the frontal region is much arched ; otherwise nearly 

 similar to Thrasops.

This species bears considerable resemblance to T. occidentalis, but is 

 distinguished by prominent characters. 



In the animal which is the subject of this description, an entozoon (Pentas- 

 tomum gr acile) had entered the right internal nostril, and penetrating the 

 membranes of the meatus near its anterior orifice, had attached itself to the 

 periosteum in the right posterior sinus of the intermaxillary bone. The body 

 of the animal entirely filled the meatus; and extended as far as the mouth of 

 the cesophagus of the serpent.

 Prymnomiodon nobis. Type P. chalceus. 



Form slender, head moderately distinct. Cephalic plates normal : two nasals, 

 a loreal, one preocular. Scales carinate, arranged quincunially, those of the 

 vertebral series not larger. Gastro- and urosteges not aDgulated ; ihe latter 

 divided, the postabdominal plate entire. Pupil round. Palatine teeth very 

 little longer than pterygoids. Superior maxillary teeth minute posteriorly, 

 becoming much longer anteriorly; none grooved. 



In the system of the Erpetologie Generale, this genus might be placed near 

 Eugnathus D.#B. Its true affinities are not with Euprotodon and Lycophidium, 

 but with Thrasops Hallow., and Thamnophis Fitz. (Eutoenia B. & G.), 

 being distinguished from the latter principally by the dentition. 



185. P. chalceus nobis. 



Similar in appearance to Thamnophis proximus nobis. Muzzle rather 

 narrow ; rostral plate nearly as high as broad. Vertical rather large, its 

 lateral borders converging, presenting a right angle posteriorly. Nasals 

 equal in size. Loreal trapezoid, posterior inferior angle acute, Preocular 

 not reaching vertical. Three postoculars. Eight superior labials, eye resting 

 on fourth and fifth. Nine or ten inferior labials ; post-geneials separated, longer 

 than the anterior. Scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, elongate, emarginate 

 at the tip, those of the external row not larger than the others, keeled. Gas- 

 trosges 152; urosteges? (tail mutilated). Length of body 11 in. 8 1. 



Coloration. Olivaceous above, shading into leek green upon the flanks, and 

 greenish-white upon the belly. A vertebral band of light green bordered with 

 black extends from the occipital plates to the origin of the tail, involving one 

 and two halves rows of scales. Another narrower and paler band extends upon 

 the third and fourth rows of scales upon each side from the neck to origin of 

 tail. This band is bounded above by an interrupted narrow black border. 

 Temporal region lively green, plates of head and muzzle tinged with fulvous.

 confluent, posterior inferior angle acute. Loreal none. Superior labials eight, 

 all higher than long, except the first and last ; eye over the fourth and fifth, 

 small. One large and three small temporals bound the external border of each 

 occipital. Inferior labials ten or eleven, sixth largest, last two or three very

In the proportions of the body, this serpent much resembles the P. viridis-

 the proportions of the head and plates are different from those seen in our

 , row of scales upon the latter region and upon the ends of the gastrosteges. The 

 intervals between these lines may be variously shaded. When a light color 

 appears between each, we have the form tamiatus. (U. S. Pac. R. R. Expl.

 the gastrosteges, the first, second and half the third rows of scales, are dark, half 

 the third and fourth being bright yellow, we have lateralis or Schotlii. (Mex. 

 Bound. Surv. pi. 17.) Sometimes only the interval between the lines of the 

 second and third rows is dark ; sometimes this occurs, the inferior half of the first 

 row being also shaded. The uniform olive brown of the back is formed by the con- 

 fluence of the widened longitudinal bands ; the exterior basal portions of the

 characterized them as possessing, the one, smooth scales, the other, cari- 

 nate. After a careful study of our specimens, we have arrived at the con- 

 clusion that there is no ground for ^regarding one series of specimens possess- 

 ing carinae upon the scales, as representing a species distinct from another 

 series, whose scales are keelless. Specimens in which two or three labials 

 enter the orbit and which have the anal divided, differ in this respect, as 

 do also those with an entire anal plate, and three or two upper labials 

 entering the orbit. A specimen from near Rio Janeiro is obviously 

 Ifatrix scurrula of Wagler, (Spix, Serp. Braz. pi.) Another specimen from 

 Surinam is quite as slender as Ahaetulla pi eta. In color, specimens vary 

 from black olivaceous with a yellow dorsal line, and spots upon the first row of 

 scales upon the tail, to gray brown with oblique transverse bands. A speci- 

 men received from the Garden of Plants, exhibits two preoculars, and three 

 or four postoculars. That a careful anatomical investigation may demon- 

 strate the existence of several species among these individuals, is not improb- 

 able.

204. H. sebastus nobis. 



As a representative of its genus, this species is of a very elongate and com- 

 pressed form, with the scales arranged in transverse series, and with two 

 medial dorsal rows, larger than the others ; the dentition isodont. 



The specific characters are as follows : tail one-third the total length. 

 Scales large, in ten longitudinal rows, entirely smooth. Anal shield entire. 

 Head distinct from the neck, lanceolate. Eye large, superciliaries prominent. 

 Upper head shields large. Vertical elongate, broad anteriorly, lateral borders 

 concave, convergent. Post-frontals bent upon the sides. Rostral as high as 

 broad. Nostril between two nasals, each of the latter higher than broad. 

 Loreal rectangular, longer than high. One preocular scarcely reaching the 

 vertical. Postoculars two, inferior largest ; the two bounded posteriorly by the

"occipital and a large temporal plate. As second large temporal, separating 

 the last upper labial from the occipital. Superior labials nine, fourth, fifth 

 and sixth entering the orbit ; seventh subtrigonal, last two elongate. Inferior 

 labials ten; post-genials longer than anterior. Gastrosteges not angulated, 

 153 in number. 



Coloration. A light brownish fulvous, paler on the belly, darker upon the 

 occipital region. 



One specimen, native country unknown, but may perhaps prove to be from 

 Eastern Asia or Malaysia. 



Zaocys nobis. Type Z. dhumnades. 



Form slender, vertebral line angular. Two medial series of dorsal scales ; 

 those of the sides quincuncially arranged. Two nasals, one loreal, two pre- 

 ocular shields. 



The large isodont serpents which have the median dorsal line elevated into 

 a ridge, and the sides compressed more or less "era toit" appear to us to be 

 naturally distinguished as follows : 



A. Two median dorsal series of scales. 



Herpetodryas. Scales in more or less transverse series, one preocular. 

 Zaocys. Scales in quincunx ; two preoculars. 



B. One median dorsal series of scales. 



a. Loreals more than one. 

 Ptyas. Preoculars two or more. 



b. Not more than one loreal or preocular. 



Spilotes. Scales in sub-transverse series; head very distinct from neck ; 



loreal trapezoidal. 

 Coelognathus. Scales quincuncial ; head but little distinct; loreal trape- 

 zoidal. 

 Gonyosoma. Loreal three times as long as high or absent; muzzle very acute. 

 In proposing the name Zaocys for the Coryphodontes carinatus and 

 fuse u s of Gunther. and in retaining Fitzinger's name Ptyas for the C. B lu- 

 menbachii and C. korros of the Erpetologie General, we are giving ex- 

 pression to an opinion long held by us, as to the unnatural association of 

 species in the so-called genus Coryphodon, of those authors. In it we find 

 cylindrical terrestrial serpents united with compressed subarboricole species, 

 upon a peculiarity whose value as an index of nature appears to us entirely 

 imaginary. The very nature of the coryphodontian type of dentition as dis- 

 tinguished from the isodontian and syncranlerian would lead us to infer its in- 

 constancy ; and it does exist, we believe, in species claimed to be isodont ; e. g. 

 in the genera Lampropeltis, Drymobius, etc.

Our single specimen differs slightly from descriptions in the arrangement of 

 the colors upon the upper surface of the body. Hence we append the following 

 notes. 



Scales small, entirely smooth, in twenty-seven longitudinal series. Tail two- 

 ninths the entire length. Head slightly distinct, acute. Rostral plate rather 

 prominent, as high as broad, visible from above. Two small supplemental 

 plates between it and the prefrontals : the latter as long as broad. Postfrontals 

 longer than broad ; superciliaries narrow ; vertical rather broad anteriorly, 

 elongate, the lateral borders straight, and so convergent as to render it almost 

 trilateral. Occipitals elongate truncate posteriorly, two elongate temporals 

 bound the external border. Nasals two, large, nostrils between; loreal longer 

 than high, the posterior border curved oblique. Preocular large, reaching the 

 vertical, rugulose ; postoculars two. Superior labials ten, eye resting on the 

 fifth, sixth and seventh ; eighth longer than high, ninth higher than long, both 

 bounded above by an elongate temporal. Inferior labials twelve, seventh 

 largest; pregeneials longer than postgeneials. Postabdominal scute entire. 

 Gastrosteges 223, a little recurved upon the sides ; urosteges 88 pair. Totaj 

 length, 29 in. 3 1., of tail 6 in. 6 I. 



Coloration. Under surface light yellow, with a few black specks upon the 

 extremities of the scales anteriorly. Above a delicate fawn brown, the two 

 inferior rows of scales paler. Anterior to the middle of the body, the scales 

 of the rows between the third and tenth assume a darker shade ; this becomes 

 a distinct lateral band posteriorly, and extends to the extremity of the tail. 

 On the anterior third of the body, the skin, upon being stretched, exhibits the 

 following pattern. Pale trigonal areas, alternating and extending from the me- 

 dian line to the ninth row of scales upon each side. A series of small light spots 

 upon the eighth row alternates with these. Lower down, opposite to the first, 

 are diamond shaped pale areas, and a second row of larger alternating spots 

 upon the second, third and fourth rows of scales. The spots of this and of 

 the upper series become larger anteriorly, and are bordered above and below 

 with black ; the pale areas become obsolete. There are two parallel black 

 lines upon the neck ; one oblique, upon each side of the neck ; one extending 

 from the eye to the mouth, upon the upper border of the eighth superior labial, 

 and an obscure one upon the common suture of the occipitals.

As in many other serpents of Eastern Asia, the maxillary and mandibular

 muzzle obtuse. Tail one-fifth the total length, flat beneath. Twenty-five 

 rows of scales, those from the ninth to the sixteenth keeled. Rostral plate 

 broader than high, the labial suture one-third the nasal, less than the pre- 

 frontal. Eight superior labials, fourth and fifth bounding the orbit. Seventh 

 much longer than high, bounded above by a long temporal, and by a short 

 one, which also bounds the eighth labial. Postoculars two, superior largest. 

 Preoculars two, as in other species of the genus, the superior very large, its 

 horizontal diameter greater than the length of the Toreal. The latter plate 

 much longer than high. Postfrontals large, bent upon the sides. Anterior

border of the vertical shorter than the straight, convergent lateral ; posterior 

 angle obtuse. Superciliaries large. Occipitals elongate, external borders 

 convergent, bounded by two long temporals. Inferior labials ten, eleven, or 

 twelve. Gastrosteges 232 ; one divided anal ; urosteges 101 pair. Total 

 length of specimen from Ningpo 64 in., tail 13 in. ; specimen from Siam 30 in., 

 tail 6 in., 3 lines. 



Coloration. Above, an olivaceous ash, or clay color, more olive anteriorly. 

 A blackish lateral band extends from the tip of the tail, throughout the poste- 

 rior third of the body, where it extends from the second to the ninth rows of 

 scales, reducing the ground color to a dorsal stripe of three or four scales in 

 width. It is divided by a number of irregular narrow vertical lines, at regular 

 distances. The superior border is prolonged upon the anterior two-thirds of 

 the body as an irregular, narrow, longitudinal black band, connected with 

 that of the opposite side by similar short transverse bands at distances of four 

 or five scales. Irregular black borders and centres of the median lateral 

 scales, are the only indications of the inferior part of the lateral band anterior- 

 ly. Gastrosteges tipped with black anteriorly ; the central parts become 

 gradually darker posteriorly, but finally give place to a yellow median band 

 which extends to the tip of the tail. This is bounded by a blackish band on 

 each side, which is separated from that of the sides by another yellow one, 

 which involves the tips of the gastrosteges, and first row of scales. The only 

 marking upon the head is a black postocular vitta, which extends along the 

 upper borders of the labials and no farther, parallel to the commissure of the 

 mouth. Pectus, throat, chin and superior labials yellowish.

AVe can find no notice of this fine serpent, except a brief description appended 

 to specimen c under Elaphis virgatus of the British Museum Catalogue. 

 This specimen, which is from Chikiang, China, most probably belongs to the 

 present species. Elaphis virgatus differs from taeniurus in its more 

 elevated rostral with more equal borders, its shorter loreal and preocular, 

 etc. 



E. bilineatus Hallowell, Proc. Acad., 1860, p. 497, from Japan, is near- 

 ly allied to, if not a variety of, E. quadrivirgatus Gthr. 



Note. In these Proceedings, 1860, p. 241, we characterized a genus of ser- 

 pents from West Africa, having entire urosteges, under the name Pariaspis. 

 This name we find must give way to Elapops, Gthr., of a few months prior 

 date; vid. Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. 1859, 151. E. modestus Gthr., appears to 

 differ from E, plumbeater in having but one postocular, two temporals 

 bounding the occipital instead of one, and in color. In the latter species there 

 is no shade of olivaceous. The plate represents a rather broader vertical and 

 perhaps a smaller rostral. We look for further specimens to substantiate these 

 differences. 



Ozyrhopus melanocrotaphus nobis, 1. c, p. 260, is apparently Crotaphopeltis 

 rufescens Filz. The latter genus differs from Sibon in its entire anal plate. 



Phimothyra nobis, 1. c, p. 253, is intended to take the place of Salvadora Bd. 

 & Grd., the latter name having been previously applied by Linnaeus to a genus 

 of plants. 



Phyllobates a u r a t u s , 1. c, p. 372, was erroneously stated to inhabit Chili. 

 It has as yet been found only on the Island of Taboga, Bay of Panama. 



We are authorized to state that Lampropeltis vmltistriata Kennicott, 1. c, 

 p. 328, is a misprint for L. mu ltistrata Kenn.

Descriptions of some New Species of Tertiary Fossils from Chiriqui, Central 



America. 



BY W. M. GABB. 



The following species were collected by Dr. John Evans during his examina- 

 tions, under the patronage of the U. S. Government, in Chiriqui. I have, as 

 yet, received no definite information in regard to their exact locality or geo- 

 logical position. The material is too scant to form a definite idea in regard to 

 their age, but I believe them to be Miocene. Full information on the subject 

 will be contained in Dr. Evans's report. It is worthy of notice that among a 

 large number of specimens there should be so few species. The matrix is a 

 dark, almost black, highly bituminous shale. 



Terebra. 



T. E v a n s i i . Shell turrited, whorls about eight or nine, angulated above; 

 suture distinct; surface polished and marked by an impressed line about a 

 third of the width of the whorl from the upper edge ; below marked by several 

 faint revolving lines. Aperture subquadrate, columella somewhat prolonged, 

 tortuous, and with two faint folds ; outer lip sinuous, most prominent near the 

 lower part of the mouth. Rather common. 



Dimensions. Length, 1 inch ; width of body-whorl, -5 in. ; length of aper- 

 ture, -4 in. 



Tellina. 



T. semilaevis. Shell subtriangular, truncate posteriorly, inequilateral ; 

 beaks one-third of the distance from the posterior extremity, with a faint 

 angulation extending from them, parallel with the posterior side, to the 

 margin ; posterior side nearly straight ; posterior angle obtuse ; anterior end 

 regularly rounded ; surface, in the young state, smooth ; in the adults, with the 

 marginal half concentrically striate. Very rare. 



Dimensions. Length, -6 in.; width, -75 in.; thickness, -35 in. 



Chione. 



C. sulcata. Shell ventricose, robust, produced posteriorly; umbones 

 large and round ; anterior margin regularly rounded, basal sinuous, posterior 

 nearly straight. Umbonal ridge rounded, with the shell posterior to it at a 

 right angle with the rest of the shell, and with a very distinct depression or 

 sulcus anterior to it. Surface marked by about twenty heavy transverse ribs, 

 crossed by numerous radiating impressed lines. Inner margin crenulate 

 Rare. 



Dimensions. Length, '6 in.; width, -8 in.; thickness, -6 in. 



Arca. 



A. Chiriquiensis. Ventricose, inequilateral, umbones very large ; 

 hinge line short, with the teeth very small and at right angles to the hinge. 

 Surface marked by numerous radiating ribs, with the depressions between 

 them of about the same size as the ribs : these are crossed by very distinct 

 lines of growth ; and on the ribs are numerous small nodes, which appear to 

 be independent of the lines of growth, and are not merely squamose elevations. 

 These nodes are most prominent on the anterior ribs, and become gradually 

 fainter posteriorly until, posterior to the umbonal ridge, they disappear. Area 

 wide and marked by very few angular lines. This species is exceedingly 

 common, and is sometimes nearly three inches across. 



Dimensions of the most perfect specimen. Length, 1*5 in.; width, 1-6 in. ; depth 

 of valve, -8 in.

posed of cells arranged in irregular lines ; cells large, broadly oval ; openings of 

 the same shape as the cells, though smaller, by the projection inwards of the 

 wall of the cell. Between the cells are numerous small interspaces formed by 

 the inaccurate apposition of the cells. In this species we found no ovarian 

 vesicles. The common base of the colony is longitudinally and obliquely striate. 



Descriptions of Three New Species of Starfishes from Cape St. Lucas. 



BY JOHN XANTUS. 



1. ASTERIAS SERTULIFERA, XantllS. 



With five moderately tapering and somewhat angular arms. Length of each 

 arm about two and a quarter times the diameter of the disk. Ambulacral 

 spines very slender, flattened, linear, mostly in a single row. Exterior to them, 

 on the ventral side, a double or treble row of stouter spines of equal length, 

 also somewhat flattened, with blunt extremities. Back of the arm with five 

 pretty regular rows of cylindrical or moderately-tapering spines nearly as large 

 as those on the belly. The lateral rows are more regular than the others, and 

 the spines of these rows arise from a very regular series of subtria'ngular 

 ossicles, one spine to every alternate ossicle. These back-spines are all 

 crowned at or near their tips with a thick wreath of minute pedicellariae. No 

 pedicellariae in the intervals between the spines. Rarely a large pedicellaria 

 in the ambulacral furrows. 



Diameter, four and a half inches. 



Related to A. glacialis. 



Found on rocks at low-water mark. 



2. Heliaster microbrachia, Xantus. 



Arms thirty-five in number, each in length forming about one-eighth the 

 entire diameter of the body. Ambulacral pores very small, in four rows. 

 Ambulacral spines stout, blunt, and forming a single row. Lateral spines of 

 the arms compressed, very broad and flat, often bifurcated at their extremities. 

 Dorsal spines very small and numerous, uniformly distributed, scattered with- 

 out order over the surface of the disk and arms. 



Diameter, seven inches. 



3. Heliaster kubiniji, Xantus. 



Arms twenty-two to twenty-four in number, each in length forming rather 

 less than one-third the whole diameter of the body. Ambulacral spines in a 

 single row. Ventral spines compressed at their extremities. Dorsal spines 

 capitate, in four to six series on the back of the arms ; on the disk much 

 larger and less numerous, and with flat or even concave tops. Pedicellaria? 

 thickly distributed between the spines. 



Diameter, seven inches. 



Collected at Cerro Blanco, off Cape St. Lucas. 



I take pleasure in dedicating this species to my countryman M. Kubiniji, the 

 accomplished Director of the Hungarian National Museum at Pesth. 



Type specimens of all of the above species have been transmitted to the 

 Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.

ture. The head is much depressed, and very broad, constituting somewhat 

 less than one-fifth of the total length. The mouth is small, and has the upper 

 jaw the longer. The maxillar barbies extend a slight distance beyond the 

 branchial aperture. The eye is of medium size, circular ; its diameter enter- 

 ing six times in the length of the side of the head ; the orbits are nearly four 

 diameters apart. The spine of the dorsal fin is perfectly smooth ; and the spine 

 of the pectoral very coarsely serrated. The caudal fin is moderately forked.

Color. In alcoholic specimens, the head, back and upper half of the sides are 

 bright sienna; the belly silvery white. Margin of the dorsal, caudal, and anal 

 fins, glossy black ; the marking on the anal broader and not so deep. Numer- 

 ous small, circular black spots are scattered irregularly over the budy, in ap- 

 pearance similar to those, of the Trout (S.fontinalis), except in color. 



Habitat. Fort Reily, Kansas. 



This species is named in honor of Dr. Wm. A. Hammond, who has presented 

 the Academy with many new and valuable western fishes. 



2. Pimelodns notatus, Abbott. Spec. char. The head and body are 

 very much compressed, and the body tapers rapidly to the tail. The peduncle 

 of the tail is slender and increases in width as it approaches the insertion of the 

 fin. The facial outline is very oblique, and with the dorsal outline makes con- 

 siderable curvature, from the anterior insertion of the dorsal fin to the extrem- 

 ity of the upper jaw. The eyes are large, situated equidistantly between the 

 extremity of the upper jaw and margin of the opercle ; the diameter of the orbit 

 is contained four times in the length of the side of the head. The spines of 

 both dorsal and pectoral fins are finally serrated. The anterior insertion of 

 the dorsal fin is equidistant between the insertions of the pectoral and ventjal 

 fins. The extremities of the rays of the pectoral extend to the insertion of the 

 ventral fins. The extremities of the rays of the ventral extend beyond the an- 

 terior insertion of the anal fin. The anal fin is large ; the base equal to one- 

 fourth of the total length. The caudal fin is very deeply forked. 



The numbers of the fin-rays are D, V, A, C. 



Color. In alcoholic specimens, the head and back are umber color; sides and 

 belly yellowish, with metallic lustre. A circular black spot exists at the 

 origin of the lateral line. 



Total length seven inches. 



Habitat. Fort Reily, Kansas. 



Dr. Wm. A. Hammond has presented the Academy with a single specimen of 

 this Pimelodus.

Only two specimens have been examined. It may be worthy of notice that 

 these were obtained from widely separated localities. The specimen in the 

 Society's cabinet was taken in Comal county, Texas, while that in the collec- 

 tion of Mr. George Newman was obtained in Gloucester county, N. J. They 

 have been several times compared, and have been found to differ only in size, 

 the Texas specimen being the larger.

 green color ; head and thorax rufous, the latter somewhat globular, much con- 

 tracted anteriorly and slightly posteriorly ; elytra yellowish, clothed with short 

 golden hairs, densely punctured, slightly narrowed posteriorly, with a lateral 

 and a sutural stripe on each, extending over three-fourths of the length of the 

 elytra. The lateral stripe is sometimes broad and clavate ; legs yellowish ; 

 femora more or less clavate.

CHAPTER XIV. 



PUBLICATION FUND. 



Article I. The Academy hereby establishes a permanent fund to be called 

 the "Publication Fund," the principal of which shall always be kept in- 

 vested in good securities, and the interest accruing thereupon shall be ap- 

 plied to the payment of the expenses of publishing such matters, stated or oc- 

 casional, as the Academy may think proper to issue. 



Article II. All monies which may be paid or contributed to the " Publi- 

 cation Fund, " shall be held by the Academy in trust for the purposes set 

 forth in the first article of this chapter. 



Article III. The said monies shall from time to time be invested in the 

 corporate name of the Academy, in the public loans of the State of Pennsylva- 

 nia or those of the city of Philadelphia, or in such sound real estate securities 

 as the Academy may direct. 



Article IV. No investment shall be changed without the consent of the 

 Academy, and all monies received in consequence of any such change shall 

 be invested for the same trusts as the original fund. 



Article V. The Treasurer shall open a separate account in the proper 

 books of the Academy, under the head of the " Publication Fund," in which 

 shall be entered all payments and contributions for the purposes of said Fund, 

 and all other matters and things relating to said account. 



Article VI. Any person who shall pay to the Treasurer of the Academy 

 the sum of twenty-five dollars in aid of this fund, shall be entitled to receive 

 a copy of the Proceedings during life, and any person who shall in like man- 

 ner pay the sum of fifty dollars shall be entitled to receive a copy of the 

 Journal during life. 



Article VII. To every person whose contribution to the Publica ion Fund 

 shall entitle him to receive a copy of the Proceedings or Journal or both, a 

 certificate shall be issued, in ^uch form as the Academy shall prescribe, con- 

 taining a copy of this chapter and a statement of the amount of his contri- 

 bution. 



The following amendment to the By-laws was adopted on the 28th of Feb- 

 ruary : 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 575 



The Department B shall be denominated the Geographical Department of 

 the Academy. 



No report of the organization of this department has been communicated to 

 the Academy. 



All of which is respectfully submitted.

Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR 1860. 



The Library of the Academy has, during the past year, been increased by 

 351 volumes and 629 periodicals and pamphlets, on subjects belonging to the 

 Natural Sciences. Of these works, 111 are from authors, 160 from editors, 

 321 from Societies, 45 from Dr. J. H. Janeway, 32 from Dr. S. Weir Mitchell. 

 167 from Dr. Thomas B. Wilson, and 144 from other members and correspon- 

 dents. During the year that has just closed, 269 volumes have been bound : 

 71 at the expense of Dr. Wilson, and 198 by the Academy. The department 

 of the Library appropriated to periodicals, as was stated in the last report 

 would be the case, is very much straitened for room, and the recommen- 

 dation then made in regard to the construction of additional cases is now re- 

 peated. Unless additional room is obtained, it will be impossible to place the 

 books properly upon the shelves. No books are believed to have been lost or 

 missed from the Library during the last year. 



It is of great importance that all valuable books of Natural Science, in all 

 its departments, should be added to the Library as soon as they are published. 

 in order that it may keep pace with the progress of knowledge and maintain 

 that superiority as a Library of reference which it now possesses. The ordi- 

 nary means of the Academy will not permit this, and meet its other necessary 

 expenses. Several gentlemen have united in a subscription of a certain sum 

 per annum for 5 years, to meet this want. These subscriptions are not bind- 

 ing unless 25 subscribers are obtained. Four are yet wanting to complete 

 the number, and it is hoped that these will soon be found, so that the Library 

 may be placed in such a condition as will secure its most eminent usefulness 

 in the cause of Science. 



Respectfully submitted, 



JAMES C. FISHER, M.D.. 



Librarian.

1. Dr. Mitchell stated that lately in examining, in conjunction with 

 Dr. Hammond, the chemistry of corroval and vao, they had succeeded in 

 obtaining, in a crystalline form, corrovaline. It is formed by evaporation, 

 from the solution in chloroform ; one grain of corrovaline thus prepared 

 was dissolved in one hundred grains of water, and one drop from the 

 solution was sufficient to kill a mouse. The same quantity, in ten minute?, 

 killed a frog. 



2. Mr. Powel stated that when very young, in the laboratory of hi? 

 uncle, Dr. Robert Hare, he had witnessed some very extraordinary 

 poisonous qualities exhibited by the residue of the sweet oil of wine, dis- 

 tilled with some turpentine. The smell of this was sufficient to produce 

 dizziness aud lethargic symptoms.

Dr. Schmidt read the following paper upon a ' Method of Painting 

 moist Anatomical Preparations." 



Method of Painting- Moist Anatomical Preparations 

 BY II. D. SCHMIDT, M. D. 



it is more due to neglect than any other motive, that I have not pub- 

 lished, before this, the useful process of painting anatomical preparations, 

 intended to be suspended in alcohol. The latter, as is known to every 

 anatomist, affects the color of the different components of an organ, and 

 thus renders them almost alike in appearance. This is a great disadvan- 

 tage, as the object of such a preparation, is to show the relationship of 

 the various parts of an organ, or that of different organs themselves. 

 For instance, if the larger bloodvessels and ducts of a liver or kidney, &c, 

 are injected and carefully dissected out, to exhibit their relative course, 

 .such a preparation will be of comparatively little value, if these vessels 

 can not be readily distinguished from each other. This can only be ac- 

 complished by painting them with different colors. In dried preparations, 

 this is easily done by coloring with oil-paint, commonly used by artists. 

 But as the tissues of such preparations lose entirely their form by shrink- 

 ing, they are rendered to a great extent unfit for study. It is different 

 however, in the case of preparations intended to be preserved in a moist 

 condition by suspension in alcohol. Here, the anatomist often becomes 

 discouraged, when he finds his best dissections losing in appearance 

 by the injurious action of the alcohol on the color of the tissues. To 

 counterbalance this disadvantage, I have used a vehicle, which, while it 

 unites with the tissues and thus adheres to them, is not affected injurious- 

 ly by the action of the alcohol, but on the contrary, rendered only more 

 firm. The process is so simple, that it seems rather strange not to have 

 been resorted to long ago. The principle used as a vehicle, isalbumen, in 

 the form of the white of egg ; and this is almost the only substance which 

 will unite with the tissues, (as a great part of the latter consists of it,) 

 without being injuriously affected by the alcohol. The colors used, of 

 course must be mineral, and thoroughly ground with the albumen, on a 

 plate of glass. After the preparation is painted, it is put into strong 

 alcohol, which, to coagulate the albumen still more firmly, may be warmed. 

 Not only the blood-vessels, ducts and nerves, may thus be beautifully 

 colored, but with some artistical skill the color of the parenchyma of the 

 organ may also be nicely imitated. 



In the Anatomical Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, a liver 

 with the blood-vessels and ducts carefully dissected, and painted with 

 different colors by the above described process, can be seen suspended in 

 alcohol. Likewise a kidney and a spleen ; the color of the fresh 

 parenchyma of the former is also imitated. These preparations I made 

 three years ago, and up to the present time not the slightest change in 

 the colors can be perceived ; although they have often been carried to 

 and from the lecture room. Another preparation, exhibiting the smaller 

 muscles of the larynx, which are painted red, can also be seen. Intricate 

 dissections of various regions can be made, the muscles, vessels, nerves, 

 &c, colored, and their form preserved by the suspension in alcohol. 



[Feb, 




Dept] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. I 



In connection with this subject, Dr. Leidy stated that he is in the habit 

 of suspending injected preparations in turpentine, by which liquid the 

 tissues are rendered translucent. The jars in which they are thus sus- 

 pended, are hermetically sealed by means of a piece of hog's bladder, well 

 soaked and dipped in a cement of gum arabic, acetic acid and sugar I n 

 order to suspend the preparation, a. piece of whalebone or a bar of metal 

 should be used ; wood is too porous. Thus arranged the turpentine 

 remains perfectly limpid. 



Dr. Leidy added, that in these preparations, some change must take 

 place in the air over the turpentine, for the bladder covering the jar 

 bellies down, becoming concave. To give therefore a neater appearance 

 to the preparation, he is in the habit of applying a second piece of blad- 

 der, prepared as the other ; in which a small orifice is made with a pin. 

 which prevents its retraction into the neck of the jar. 



Mr. Slack stated that in England, glycerin was exteusively used for 

 mounting preparations, the high price of alcohol in that country prevent- 

 ing its general use for such a purpose. 



II. Pathology. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited a portion of the stomach of a horse recently dead. 

 which contained a number of spheroidal tumors, about an inch in diame- 

 ter, The tumors contained a number of nematoid worms (Spiroptera me- 

 gastoma) still alive. 



Dr. Darrach, who had examined the structure of these tumors, had 

 found their walls to be principally fibrous tissue, containing a puruloid 

 matter filled with fine granules, which were the eggs of the worm. These 

 tumors possessed orifices communicating with the stomach. 



This horse was said to have died from rupture of the diaphragm 

 caused by great distension of the intestines, in consequence of a large- 

 meal of Indian Corn. This rupture was situated in the muscular portion 

 of the diaphragm, and was about six inches in length. 



III. Teratology. 



Dr. Morris related a case of arrest of development in the hand of a 

 young man with whom he is acquainted. This arrest is in two of his 

 fingers. This condition of things is attributed by Dr. Morris to the 

 action of filaments thrown around the fingers, and checking their growth, 

 probably about the third or fourth month of intra- uterine life. These 

 filaments or ligatures were assigned first by Dr. Montgomery as a cause 

 of this phenomenon. 



Dr. Mitchell while acknowledging, as a general rule, the justice of the 

 reason assigned by Dr. Morris, for these arrests of development, declared 

 that it could not explain those cases where for a series of generations the 

 same deformity exists. 



The mother of the person alluded to here, attributed the condition of 

 her son's hand to her having witnessed the amputation by a surgeon of 

 the same fingers while pregnant.

Dr. Mitchell read the following paper on Corroval and Vao.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Biolog- 



Ofl ihe Physical and Chemical characteristics of Corroval and Vao, two recently 

 discovered varieties of Woorara, and on a new Alkaloid constituting their 

 active principle. 



BY WILLIAM A. HAMMOND, M. D. 



Assistant Surgeon U. S. Army, and 



S. WEIR MITCHELL, M. D. 



Lecturer nn Physiology in the Ihiladelphia Medical Association. 



The two new varieties of woorara, which, so far as relates to their 

 physical and chemical characteristics, we design considering at present, 

 were brought in February, 1857, from the Rio Darien, in New Granada. 

 by Drs. Ruschenberger and Caldwell of the United States Navy. By 

 these gentlemen they were presented to Prof. Joseph Carson, of the 

 University of Pennsylvania, to whom we must express our acknowledg- 

 ments for the opportunity afforded us of analyzing and experimenting 

 with these curious poisons. 



The corroval, the more powerful of the two, has the general appearance 

 of a vegetable extract of a brownish black color. The fracture is some- 

 what conchoidal, but some of the fragments in our possession have a sur- 

 face such as would be given to the superficies of an inspissated vegetable 

 infusion on cooling. When pulverized, itis of a tawny yellow appearance. 

 Its taste is an intense and very persistent bitter. The saturated aqueous 

 infusion is of a very dark brown, almost black color, and of neutral or 

 exceedingly slight acid reaction. The alcoholic tincture is of a pale 

 yellow tint. Both water and alcohol extract the poisonous principle, as 

 do also ether and chloroform, though to a very diminished extent. No 

 crystals are deposited from either of these solutions, except from the 

 ethereal. They consist entirely of fatty substances. 



The residue, insoluble in water, submitted to microscopical examination, 

 is seen to consist of vegetable cells, starch granules, portions of woody 

 tissues, oil globules, &c; small grains of silica are also to be observed. 

 No parts of animals of any kind can be discovered by most careful ex- 

 amination with object-glasses of high power and excellent defining quality. 

 If the fangs of poisonous serpents, the livers and other parts of the body 

 were used in the manufacture of con-oval, we should undoubtedly have 

 detected their anatomical elements. We therefore regard it as certain 

 that such substances do not enter into the composition of the material 

 under consideration. 



Corroval burns with a yellow flame, and gives off a considerable amount 

 of smoke and vapor. This latter has an odor very similar to that of 

 human excrement, and, as we have ascertained, possesses all the poisonous 

 activity of the corroval in substance. A mouse made to inhale the fumes 

 died in less than two minutes. Corroval heated upon platinum foil, in 

 the flame of the blow-pipe, is almost entirely volatilized. The ash con- 

 sists of silica, iron, and certain saline substances. 



In external characteristics vao cannot be distinguished from corroval. 

 That in our possession is a dark brown extract, hard, and perfectly 

 dry, and unaffected by exposure to the atmosphere. It yields its toxic 

 principle to water and alcohol, the infusions being of similar physical 

 qualities and reaction with those of corroval. The insoluble portion 



[April, 




Bept.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



consists of a white or light gray deposit of a shred-like and flocculent 

 appearance, Examined under the microscope this is seen to be princi- 

 pally composed of amorphous matter with which, however, starch granules 

 and cells of vegetable origin, together with masses of woody tissue and 

 fragments of silica are mingled. No animal structures are to be detected 

 on the most minute examination. 



Vao subjected to the action of heat acts in a manner not distinguish- 

 able from that of corroval, giving off a vapor with similar odor and other 

 properties to that derived from the latter substance. 



Woorara, of which corroval and vao may with propriety be considered 

 as constituting species, has been analyzed by Roulin and Boussingault,* 

 Pelletier and Petrozf and Heintz.} 



Roulin and Bmissingault experimented with woorara which had been 

 obtained from the Rio Negro. It was a solid extract of a black color, 

 but brown when reduced to powder, of a. resinous appearance, and ex- 

 ceedingly bitter taste. It burned with difficulty, and gave off no odor of 

 organic nitrogenous substances. It was soluble in water, alcohol and in 

 sulphuric ether, though not to any considerable extent. The aqueous 

 infusion was of slight acid reaction ; no strychnine was discovered by 

 these chemists in woorara. 



We may here state that two specimens of ordinary woorara, which we 

 owe to the kindness of Major LeConte, of Philadelphia, and Prof. J. (J. 

 Dalton, of New York, agree in all essential particulars with that above 

 described. 



By the following process, Roulin and Boussingault obtained from 

 woorara a new principle of an alkaloidal character, which they called 

 curarin. 



The woorara was reduced to fine powder and treated repeatedly with 

 boiling alcohol. The extract thus obtained was evaporated, and the 

 solid residue treated with water, which dissolved the active principle, 

 leaving nothing but a little resinous matter. The aqueous solution was 

 then decolorized by animal charcoal, and treated with infusion of galls. 

 A beautiful whitish-yellow, flaky precipitate was then thrown down, having 

 an exceedingly bitter taste. The supernatant liquid was almost entirely 

 deprived of its bitterness; the precipitate thus obtained was well washed, 

 heated to ebullition in water, and dissolved by the addition of oxalic acid. 

 The acid liquor was then supersaturated by magnesia and filtered. It 

 was again evaporated to dryness, and the residue dissolved in alcohol. 

 This solution was concentrated and spontaneously evaporated to a syrupy 

 consistence. It was subsequently further concentrated by evaporation in 

 vacuo. 



The analysis of Pelletier and Petroz yielded a similar product. These 

 chemists extracted the woorara with alcohol, and treated the tincture thus 

 obtained with ether, in order to remove the fatty and resinous substances 

 present. The alcoholic extract was then evaporated, dissolved in water, 

 and foreign matters precipitated from the solution by the acetate of lead, 

 the excess of lead being removed by sulphuretted hydrogen. The solution 

 was then decolorized by animal charcoal, filtered and evaporated ; sul-

phuric acid diluted with absolute alcohol was then added for the purpose 

 of draining off the acetic acid. The alcohol was removed by evaporation. 

 and the sulphuric acid precipitated by baryta. The excess of the latter 

 was separated by carbonic acid, the liquid was next filtered and concen- 

 trated in the water bath, and the curarin thus obtained further dried in 

 cactio. 



Obtained by either of these processes, curarin is a solid transparent 

 resinoid substance, of a pale yellow color, very hygroscopic and soluble 

 to almost any extent in water and alcohol. Its taste is exceedingly 

 bitter. The solution in water restores the blue color to reddened litmus 

 paper, neutralizes acids, and forms salts with them, easily soluble in water. 

 but uncrystallizable. 



Curarin gives with concentrated nitric acid, a blood red color, and 

 with concentrated sulphuric acid a carmine tint. 



Heintz proceeded as follows : To the aqueous solution of the woorara, 

 tannic acid was added, and an abundant precipitate soluble in boiling 

 water was obtained. This was taken from the filter, boiled with magne- 

 sia, and then evaporated to dryness. The extract thus obtained was 

 then treated with alcohol, to remove it from any insoluble salts of magne- 

 sia, and the solution again evaporated to dryness. By this means a yel- 

 lowish brown extract was obtained, possessing no alkaline reaction, but 

 endowed in a eminent degree with the toxic principle of the woorara. 

 Heintz does not regard this extract as at all pure ; subsequently he em- 

 ployed both the bichlorides of mercury and platinum, to effect the pre- 

 cipitation, but with no better success, a yellowish extract being still ob- 

 tained. 



Heintz ascertained by Lassaigne's method that the extract contained 

 nitrogen ; he also found sugar, gum, resin, extractive matter and tannic 

 and gallic acids ; traces of saline combinations with organic acids, probably 

 the tartaric and oxalic were also detected. He was unable to discern 

 the least trace of strychnia. 



We think it highly probable, that the woorara examined by Heintz 

 was very far from being of identical character with that analysed by 

 Roulin and Boussingault and Pelletier and Petroz. The difference in 

 the process employed is not sufficient to account for the very dissimilar 

 product obtained by Heintz. His method was certainly such as to have 

 separated any alkafoidal principle present The substance he did obtain 

 was probably nothing but a purified and more highly concentrated 

 woorara, deprived of its woody fibre, starch, silica, &c. 



We now proceed to detail the several steps in a qualitative analysis. 

 made of the con oval and vao. 



A few grains of corroval were subjected to the action of ether. From 

 the solution thus obtained, oil-globules were deposited on evapora- 

 tion, together with a number of minute acicular crystals, insoluble in 

 water, but completely dissolved by hot alcohol and ether. Globular masses 

 of a supposed resin were also present. 



To another portion, water was added till it was completely extracted 

 of all its bitter principle. The residue was perceived to contain several 

 masses apparently of a fatty character. On subjecting this substance to 

 the action of hot ether, it was entirely dissolved, and on evaporating the 

 solution from a slip of glass, and viewing the residue with the microscope, 

 numerous delicate acicular crystals collected in groups and radiating 

 from a central nucleus were perceived. These were soluble inhot alcohol. 

 The remaining portion was in the form of oil-globules. 



[April. 




Dept.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



After thus separating the fatty substances as above, the portion in- 

 soluble in water was placed in a small retort with a little water ; a 

 receiver surrounded with ice was luted to the retort, and heat applied to 

 the latter. On the surface of the distillate a small portion of essential 

 oil floated. This had an odor somewhat resembling that of mustard, but 

 much less pungent. 



The substance remaining in the retort was next dried at a low tempera- 

 ture, and subjected to the action of alcohol. A yellowish-brown solution 

 resulted, from which, on evaporation, a resinoid substance was ob- 

 tained, having an odor very similar to that of a true essential oil. 



The residue was next calcined in a platinum crucible. By this process 

 the woody fibre, &c, was consumed, hydrochloric acid was added to the ash, 

 and the silica thus separated. To a portion of this solution in hydrochlo- 

 ric acid diluted with water, ferrocyanide of potassium was added, and 

 distinct evidence of the presence of iron obtained. Another portion 

 treated with bichloride of platinum gave after a lapse of several hours 

 a reddish crystalline precipitate, indicating the presence of soda. 



We were prevented by an accident continuingthe analysis of the above 

 portion. 



The aqueous solution was found by the addition of gelatin in excess, to 

 yield a flaky, yellowish white precipitate of tannate of gelatine. It was 

 filtered, and to the filtrate perchloride of iron added. A black precipi- 

 tate of gallate of iron was thrown down. 



From the foregoing analysis we conceive that we have ascertained the 

 existencee in corroval. besides, the active principle, of the following sub- 

 stances : Olein, Margarin, Essential Oil, Resin, Starch, Silica, Iron. 

 Soda, Woody Fibre, Tannic Acid, Gallic Acid. 



The small quantity of corroval in our possession, prevented us from ex- 

 tending our analysis further in this direction, and for the same reason we 

 are the less disposed to insist upon the absolute accuracy in all its steps of 

 the foregoing investigation. Several of the above named substances were 

 detected by the microscope alone, and this instrument was constantly 

 employed throughout the whole analysis. 



In the separation of the active principle of the corroval, we made use 

 of the following processes : 



1st. Ten grains of the substance were extracted by repeated portions 

 of boiling water, till a bitter taste was no longer afforded. The solutions 

 were now mixed and boiled with magnesia. It was next filtered, and 

 the filtrate filtered repeatedly through animal charcoal, till all the bitter- 

 ness and coloring matter were entirely absorbed. The charcoal was then 

 treated with boiling alcohol in fresh portions till all bitterness was ex- 

 tracted from it. The alcohol was then evaporated to dryness. By this 

 means a very bitter substance of a greenish white color was obtained, 

 possessed in a high degree of the toxic properties of the corroval. 



2d. The process employed in this instance was that first used by Roulin 

 and Boussingault, but modified by employing water to extract with, 

 instead of alcohol. 



Ten grains of the corroval were reduced to fine powder and extracted 

 with water, as in the first described process. To the solution, tannic acid 

 was added in excess, a voluminous flaky precipitate of a yellowish-white 

 color was thrown down. This was well washed on a filter to remove the 

 tannic acid, mixed with water and heated to boiling, a few crystals of 

 oxalic acid being added till it was entirely dissolved. The acid liquor 

 was next treated with magnesia, in excess, and filtered. The filtrate was

 evaporated to dryness, and the extract thus obtained, dissolved in hot 

 alcohol. This solution, evaporated to dryness, iurnished a substance 

 similar to that obtained by the first process, but more highly colored. 



For the principle thus obtained, possessing as it does the properties of 

 an alkaloid, and in a high degree the toxic properties of the corroval, we 

 propose, in accordance with the principles of the United States Pharma- 

 copoeia, the name of corrovalia. 



Corrovalia* is, when pure a greenish-white substance, of low specific 

 gravity, and, upon the whole, similar to tannic acid in general appear- 

 ance. It is soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, and, contrary to the 

 statement in our original memoirs, to a slight extent in water. Heated 

 upon platinum foil, in the flame of a spirit-lamp, it is entirely volatilized. 

 With concentrated nitric acid it gives an emerald green color, which 

 deepens in tint if a small piece of bichlorate of potassa be added. 

 With sulphuric acid, a reddish-brown color is formed, which, with the 

 further addition of bichromate of potassa, changes in a few minutes to a 

 deep olive green ; with ammonia it gives a deep yellow color, but no pre- 

 cipitate ; with potassa in solution, the result is much the same ; with 

 tannic acid, it gave a white precipitate. 



With iodide of potassium in solution, corrovalia yielded no precipitate 

 or change of tint, nor did it give rise to any reaction in the presence of 

 bichloride of platinum. 



Corrovalia is uncrystallizable from all its solutions, except from that 

 in chloroform. A drop of the chloroformic solution evaporated to dry- 

 ness on a slip of glass, and subjected to microscopic examination, exhibits 

 numerous acicular crystals, mostly collected in groups, and radiating 

 from common centres. 



Corrovalia neutralizes the sulphuric chlorhydric and acetic acids, and 

 in all probability others, the quantity in our possession being too small 

 for us to investigate its properties further in this direction. The salts 

 formed with the above mentioned acids, as far as we have been able to 

 ascertain, are uncrystallizable. 



Introduced into the blood, corrovalia exerts atoxic power, equalled by 

 few if any substances hitherto known to man. A grain was dissolved 

 in one hundred minims of water. One minim of this solution killed a 

 small mouse in five minutes, when inserted under the skin, and five 

 minims in four and a half minutes produced the same result in a medium 

 sized rabbit. With frogs it is especially active. 



The amount of alkaloid obtained by us from corroval ; amounted tc 

 about ten per cent.; from vao, the proportion did not exceed four or five 

 per cent. 



Vao is therefore much weaker than corroval, its physiological actio;: 

 is very similar to the latter substance. The amount of resin contained in 

 it is considerably greater than that found in the corroval, as is also the 

 woody fibre. For the physiological effects produced by these new and 

 curious poisons, we must refer to the memoir to which we have already 

 alluded. 



Owing to the small quantity of these substances in our possessiou, we 

 have been unable to make an ultimate analysis of them, and consequent- 

 ly cannot at present give formulas of their composition. In other respects 

 we have from the same cause been unable to carry our investigations as

 Medical Sciences, No Ixxv, N. S., July, 1859.

far as we desired. "We therefore hesitated to publish the results of our 

 examination of the chemical nature of these poisons, but upon more 

 mature reflection have concluded to lay them before the scientific world, 

 trusting at some future period to be enabled to present a more complete 

 memoir on the subject, and to correct any errors into which we may have 

 fallen in the course of the researches just concluded.*

1. Physiology. 



A paper was read, entitled, " Food of the Shad of the Atlantic Coast 

 of the United States, (Alosa sapidissima,) and the functions of the 

 pyloric c&ca. By E. R. Mordecai, M. D., of Mobile, Alabama. 



This paper, after calling to mind the anatomy of the alimentary canal of 

 the shad, lays particular stress upon the facts that the teeth are very 

 small, and of such an arrangement as to suggest its food to be easy 

 of prehension ; that the largest, longest, and also the greatest number of 

 the caeca open into the inferior wall of the expansion of the intestine 

 that is found beyond the pylorus. 



On examining the intestines of a number of shad, fresh run from the 

 sea, the caeca were always found to be distended by a brownish-looking 

 fluid substance, not differing to the naked eye from a fluid material of the 

 same color, filling the stomach. This fluid under the microscope, both 

 that from the stomach and from the caeca, was seen to be composed of 

 differently shaped and colored fragments of algae and the calcareous shields 

 of infusoria. 



The food of the shad would therefore appear to be marine algae, which 

 are broken down by the powerful muscular walls of the stomach, aided 

 by the broken shells of infusoria. The caeca are receptacles for food ; 

 enabling the animal to exist for a considerable time without receiving 

 additional nourishment. 



Arguments in favor of these views are drawn by Dr. Mordecai from 

 an analogous condition of things in other fish, that ascend fresh water 

 streams, or seek other places than those likely to supply them with food, 

 for the purpose of spawning. 



Specimens mounted for microscopical examination accompanied this 

 paper ; and the statements above made in regard to the contents of the 

 stomach and the caeca, were abundantly verified by members of the 

 Academy. 



*Some misconception appears to have been occasioned by the names under which we 

 have studied these poisons. In our first essay they were distinguished as " corroval and 

 vao, two new varieties of woorara, the South American arrow poison." In consequence 

 of this title, it has been supposed that we regarded corroval and vao as identical with 

 the woorara of De-la-Condamine, Kolliker and others. No person, however, who went 

 beyond the tiile of the papers, could possibly entertain this idea, since the toxicological 

 distinction is drawn in ihe most definite manner. All the specimens of corroval and vao 

 which we have seen, have come to us labelled woorara, and we have been informed 

 that this term, or the more specific appellation, were indiscriminately used by the 

 Indians of the Rio Darien.
