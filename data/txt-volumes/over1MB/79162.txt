OBSERVATIONS SUR LA THEORIE GENE'rALE DES PHE'NOMilNES 

 GLACIAIRES ET SUR LES GALETS STRIES, 



PAR STANISLAS MEUNIER. 

 I. 



Ayant 6X6 depuis do longues ann^es appel^ k ^tudicr d'uiio manierc 

 tres apiirofondie de nonil)r(>ux types do glaciers et de regions presen- 

 tant des traces de glaciers niaintonant disparus, il m'a paru qu'un 

 certain nombre d'assertions accept^es par la niajorite des g^ologues 

 mdritent d'etre souniises a une severe revision. 



La conclusion de mes recherches, poursuivies avec le plus grand 

 soin et avec le souci dominateur de nie degager de toute opinion 

 pr^con^ue, m'a anient a contester queUpies faits, qui sont cependant 

 cla.ssiques, et a leur sul)stituer des notions qui cadrent beaucoup 

 mieux, suivant moi, avec les grandes lignes de I'^conomie plan6taire. 

 J'ai eu souvent a recueillir a leur dgard de precieux controles et 

 ineme des verifications completes. 



L'idee qui ressortira des pages qu'on va lire, c'est qu'un glacier 

 consid^re a part est un appareil cjui, tout en remplissant son role 

 dans la physiologie generalo do la planete, est en proie, pour son 

 compte propre, aux progres d'une veritable evolution. 11 debute 

 dans une region rjui off re les conditions favorables; il s'accroit au 

 fur et a mesure de I'amplification de cos circonstances heureuses; 

 il parvient ainsi a un moment d'apogee, apres lequel il traverse des 

 phases de declin, jusqu'au moment do sa disparition totale. Chemin 

 faisant, le glacier pent entrer en relation avec un glacier voisin et 

 s'engager avec lui dans une lutte ou competition, a laquello il suc- 

 coml^*, ou dont, au contraire, il sort a son avantage. Dans un cas 

 comme dans I'autre, il en resulte pour son histoire des incidents qui 

 procurent rexplication de certaines circonstance, souvent mal com- 

 prises. Enfin, apres la cessation du glacier comme organe actif, 

 il lai.sse des vestiges de son existence jjassee, qui disjmraissent pro- 

 gre-ssivement, avec des details precieux i)our la reconstitution des 

 conditions dimaterirjues des epofjues reculees. 



Cette etude de la Fonction glaciaire presentera cette particularity 

 de faire entrer en ligne de compte le role de toutes les autres fonc- 

 tions geologiques et de resserrer par consequent les liens entre des 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



chapitres de la Science qu'on a pris I'habitude de consid^rer corame 

 completement independants les uns des autres. 



§ I. L'Origine des Glaciers. 



La formation des glaciers suppose I'existence de deux conditions 

 tout a fait priniordiales: 1° la continuite d'une temperature ambiante 

 inferieure a z^ro; 2° un sol suffisamment incline pour que la masse 

 compacte soit animee d'un mouvement continu de glissement. 



II resulte de la (lue, s(jus les latitudes ou la temperature moyenne 

 de Tannic est supdrieure a zero, un glacier ne pent se former que sur 

 des points du sol convenal)lement ek ves et atteignant en consequence, 

 des zones atmospheriques suffisamment froides, en raison du degre 

 atmothennique. Cela peut s'exprimer en disant que I'origine des 

 glaciers dans les regions situees en dehors ties zones polaires, est liee 

 directement a la surrection des montagnes, ou, si Ton aime mieux, 

 ^ I'exercice de la fonction corticale. 



On salt que la temperature de I'atmosphere decroit regulierement, 

 h mesure que Ton s'eleve, de 1 degre par 185 metres. II en resulte 

 qu'a une certaine altitud(% il n'y a plus de vapeur d'eau dans I'uir, 

 mais seulement des particules glacees, des aiguilles cristallines qm se 

 comportent conune des poussieres atmospheriques et tomhent lorsque 

 I'air est calme. (^uand dies parvicnnent dans des zones inferieures 

 plus echauffee, elles se transformcnt en vai^'urs et n'arrivent au sol 

 que i)ar les temps d'hiver. 



Les .sommets montagneux constituent des receptacles tout prepares 

 pour I'eau cristallisee, et, se couvrant de neige, deviemient, par 

 cont re-coup, des centres de rayonnement de froid. 



Suivons done d'al)ord I'evcjlution des montagnes pour arrivcr ;\ 

 celle des glaciers. 



Le grand Plateau centre — asiatifiuc d'une altitude de pres de G.OOO 

 metres, rcpr6.sent<' les premieres dtapes du plirnomene de surrection 

 de montagnes assez hautes punr recevoir la neige, avec une consti- 

 tution tre-; eloignee de celle des nujiitagnes i)r()prement dites. 



II rdsulte de I'dtuile des (''chantillons rapportes au Museum Na- 

 tional d'Histoire Xaturelle de Paris, par .NL Bonvalot et le Prince 

 Henri il'Orleans, (jue les parties les plus liautes <|u massif Pamirien 

 consistent en a.ssi.ses jurassi(jues fossiliferes, (|iii n'ont aucune appa- 

 rence <\cs roches metamorplii(jues. ( 'e sont des caleaires argileux

Lcur traiisj)ort vertical jus(in'aux altitudi's ou ils att('i}!;nc'nt 

 maintenant, est le r(^sultat de " bossellements g(5n^raux," ([ui nous 

 apparaissont coinine dos cont re-coups do travaux soutcrrains en 

 rapports tlirocts avco la protluction dcs niontagucs. I>a coinparaison 

 avec maintes localit^^s conduisent a unc conception (jui, hicii (jue 

 tr^s diroctement conncxc a I'histoirc dos glaciers, conccnic ccpcndant 

 avant tout le diapitre orogenique. C'est que le iiiecauisme d'od 

 resultent les montagnes est harinoniquement suborilonne au r^^gime 

 general du globe qui doit traverser les phases successives d'une 

 evolution verital)le; qui doit en outre proceder aux modifications de 

 son 6tat general, sans compromettre les conditions d'e(iuilil)re dc la 

 surface, parini lescpielles se signalent celles (jui sont propres au 

 develoj)peinent de la vie. 



Sans y insister, il est digne de remarque que I'ecorce, forcee de 

 suivre, dans .sa contraction continue, le noyau fluide (jui la supporte, 

 doit .se refouler sur elle-meme, se tloul)ler a la faveur de plis et de 

 charriages, sans qu'il en r^sulte pour la surface autre chose que des 

 trerablements de terre dont les plus graves ne deterininent jamais 

 que des catastrophes locales, nc laLssant apres elles aucune trace 

 geologique permanent e. 



Aussi bien, on pent considerer un massif du genre du Pamir comme 

 cont tenant, en profondeur, une vraie chaine de montagnes qui s'est 

 soulev^e lentement, apres sa constitution, au tit re dc simple detail 

 du grand ensemble en proie au bossellement general. II faudra, 

 pour que la montagne, caract^risee par sa structure brechiforine et 

 son ^tat metamorphique, apparaisse au jour, que des actions externes 

 la debarrassent de sa couverture de sediments ayant echappe aux 

 efforts mecaniques et aux actions calorificjues. De la, cette masse 

 formidable de debris rocheux, d(jnt les montagnes sont toujours 

 entour^es et dont le delayage et I'entrainement par les eaux pluviaires, 

 alimentent la .sedimentation aqueuse. 



Bonvalot' nous a donne la description de I'^rosion colossale dont 

 le plateau du Thibet est le theatre, du fait de la pluie et des autres 

 agents de I'intemp^risme: "Apres, dit-il, que la meige sera tombee 

 dans les mois qui suivront et que I'ete sera venu, le soleil fondra ces 

 reserves prodigieuses d'eau et ce sera, aux alentours de la chaine 

 Dupleix, une debacle de fin du monde. Une inondation diluvienne 

 deposera des lacs sur les hauts plateaux, les traversera de rivieres qui

entraineront les boues ^paisses et laisseront aux flancs des collines et 

 dans les anses, les deliris des hauteurs. Ces depots restent la 

 jusqu'a I'ete suivant, car I'hiver arrete le cours des fieuves. Puis, 

 la chaleur du soleil agit; elle liquefie les masses solidifiees; celles-ci 

 s'ebranlent, coulent, s'emportent, reprennent les depots oil elles les 

 ont laisses a I'entree de I'hiver et les enlevent. D'annee en annee, 

 etape par etape. elles finissent par les charrier toujours plus has, 

 sans cesse obstruant les valines, elargissant les gorges, deviant les 

 fleuves, etalant les delta.s. "- 



Done, les masses superficielles seront successivement d^mantel^es, 

 puis supprimees et le massif orogenique. refoule et m(^tamorphise, 

 se degagera eomme" le produit d'une gestation et d'une veritable 

 dehiscence de ses enveloppes protectrices. C'est comme un d(ltail 

 n^cessaire du ])henomene, que nous apparait la suppression des 

 portions superficielles d'un pays dont le sous-sol a ^te refoule sou- 

 terrainement , par des successions gencralement tres nombreuses de 

 s^ismes. 



Ajoutons que les observateurs sont d'accord pour voir avant tout 

 dans nos grandes chaines, Alpes, Pyrenees, Caucase, Himalaya, des 

 r^sidus d'^rosion jiluviaire. On est alle parfois jusqu'ii dire que les 

 Alpes ont du jicrdre de cettc maniere, autant de substance qu'elles 

 en ont conserve. C'est au cours de cette suppression, (lue les chaines 

 sont devenues peu a JX'U de vraies montagnes et rju'^'lles ont apparu 

 au jour comme les "o.ssements coinposant le .squelette de la terre" 

 selon une expression restc^e c^ldbre.

C'est aussi le procede par kniuel s'elahore le fjjenre de gisement 

 favorable a I'etablissenient ties glaciers. Et nous voici ramen^s au 

 ccpur meine de notre sujet. 



L'erosion s'attatiuant a la surface des eouches soulevees par un 

 bossellement general en nieme temps que le noyau orogenique 

 (j'elles recouvrent, en modifie progressivement ia surface, d'abord 

 continue et unifornie comme celle des grands fonds de mer. Ce 

 travail, parallele a I'oeuvre de surrection (lui peut se continuer 

 pendant des periodes geologiques entieres, favorise celle-ci en diniinu- 

 ant peu a peu le poids tie la niatiere a soulever. 



§ 2. PouvoiR DE Transport des Glaciers. 



Le glacier est un nierveilleux appareil de condensation de 1' hu- 

 midity aerienne, (jui s'y convertit en neige, puis se transforme en neve 

 et en glace. C'est en nieme temps, un centre de dispersion aqueuse, 

 car il s'y fait une evaporation active, meme par le froid et surtout 

 quand le vent souffle. Cette activity qu'il manifeste dans I'atmos- 

 phere, le glacier la deploie sur le sol, en transportant des particules 

 rocheuses de toutes dimensions. Le poids n'intervicnt pas plus 

 que la densite relative des debris: toutes les pierres, meme les plus 

 grosses, sont portees sur le dos du glacier. Ces sortes de "flotteurs" 

 sont emportes comme les corps legers a la surface des rivieres, et ils 

 vont s'acumuler sur les berges en cordons longitudinaux ou moraines 

 laterales. 



II y a cependant des differences relativement aux cours d'eau, et 

 en particulier celles qui concement les affluents ainsi que la terminaison 

 du glacier, comparable k I'embouchurc. Le melange des filets prove- 

 nant de deux glaciers qui se confondent n'etant pas possible comme 

 celui des filets constitutifs des cours d'eau, les liseres mitoyens de 

 corps flottants s'associent en trainees longitudinales dites moraines 

 medianes. En outre, les corps mineraux portes jusqu'a la region de 

 fu-sion, au lieu de constituer un delta ou (juelque sediment, s'accu- 

 mulent sans ordre en un bourrelet connu sous le nom de moraine 

 frontale et qui fait comme une fortification derriere laquelle le glacier 

 vient mourir. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



Enfin, les glaciers qui aboutissent a la mor precipitent de leur front 

 au fond de I'eau, des quantites de niateriaux que les courants ne laissent 

 pas s'accumuler sous forme de moraine. Tries plus ou moins par 

 grosseur et etales en nappes qui prennerit a certains cgards I'allure 

 des sediments ordinaires, ils vont s'emmagasiner dans des fjords qui 

 finissent par <m etre combles, Et les icebergs, detaches du front 

 terminal s'en vont, quekjuefois fort loin, laissant tomber au fond 

 de la mer des debris rochcux, de gros blocs essentiellement erratiques. 



§ 3. Erosion glaciaire. 



L'erosion produite par le glacier est consideral)le et tres par- 

 ticuliere. II agit indirectement sur les formations qui I'environnent 

 en activant I'intemjjerisme, c'est-a-dire en donnant un grand volume 

 aux pluies et en provociuant des congelations locales qui de^agregent 

 les roches. De plus, par sa faculte de transport, il prive constamment 

 les ]iarties erodees de la protection des eboulis, si efficace ailleurs. 



Mais c'est surtout par son action directe sur sa vallee que le glacier 

 travaille a la demolition de la montagne. D'ai)res les observations 

 de Dollfus-Ausset,^ le glacier de I'Aar (jui, avec ses affluents, n'a 

 (lu'une surface de 60 kilometres carres, fournit jiar jour 100 metres 

 cubes de sable qui sont emport^^s par le torrent, l/ablaticm des 

 vallees par les glaciers est done bien superieure a cellr (pic piDdui^cnt 

 la plupart des cours d'eau, a egale superficie de ba^sin. 



Le sol sous le glacier, subit une friction considerable du fait des 

 graviers et des ]iierrailles, veritable matehis interpose entre la glace 

 et le roc. M. Vallot^ a insist^ sur ce fait (jue la voiite gel(?e, a la Mer 

 de glace de C'hamonix, n'est pas mouUs sur le sol, mais lui est simple- 

 ment tangente. Le torrent sous-glaciaire s'est menage un veritable 

 tunnel. 



L'efficacite erosive du glacier ii'cn fuf |)a^ luoiiis loiigtcmp'^ con- 

 test(5e et n'est encore admisr, par certains g(5ologues. (ju'avec des 

 restrictions et conune a regret. Lapparent, dont le Tniitcilcd'eoloyic 

 a la pretention de resumer I'opinion generale, a ('•crit en 1S85:* " Nulle 

 jiart, on n'a vu les glaciers creuser, afTouiller un lit compose de 

 roches dures, ni decou|)er leurs parois eonmie font les torrents . . .

En 1893, Ic nionu> avitcur faisait parlor autri'iiuMit ropinion gone- 

 rale:* "On a boauoou]) discuto, dit-il, .sur la puissanco d'orosion des 

 glaciers. Quelques-uns la oroiont considc^rablo ; d'autres scraient 

 portes h la rogardor coninio nogligoahlo. La verit6 soniblc so trouver 

 ontre ces doux oxtronios . . . ]]n principe, puis(iuo le glacier est un 

 fleuve de glace dont rallino no differe de celle des eaux courantes que 

 par une vitesse inconiparal)lonioiit nioins grando, il doit comnic les 

 Heuves tendre vers un i)rt)fil tro(iuilil)ro ot, tant que ce profil n'est 

 pas atteint, le pouvoir do la glace doit s'eniployer k modifier en 

 cons(5quence la forme du lit . . . Memo les roches les plus dures 

 du fond ne peuvent echapper a cotto action, car les blocs quo trans- 

 porte la glace, pouss^s par une prossion considerable, agissent sur le 

 fond et les parois commo do puissants outils, etc." 



II y a bien longtemps que, pour ma part, j'ai soutenu I'opinion 

 que les glaciers r^alisent par le frottement des pierrailles qu'ils entratn- 

 ent sur les roches qui les supportent, un energique travail d'orosion. 

 J'ecrivais en 1891:^ 



''Deja j'ai eu bien souvont I'occasion de faire remarquer que la 

 zone des roches moutonneos au-dossus de la glace dans les glaciers des 

 Alpes et d'ailleurs, correspond a des points ou la glace ti'aiteinl plus, 

 justement parce que, grace a son action erosive, elle a pen6tre 

 verticalemont dans la masse rocheuse sous-jacente. Elle est vrai- 

 ment comparable a une scie, entrant dans une piece de bois et qui 

 bientot se meut au-dessous des points qu'elle a scies prec^demment 

 mais qui ne datent pas d'un temps ou sa lame aurait 6te plus large." 



"Coux qui, dit Tj'ndall^ ont soutenu que les glaciers creusent les 

 vallees, n'ont jamais dit, ni voulu dire, que ce fut le hec du glacier 

 qui agit dans ce cas. Pour le glacier de Morteratsch (Engadine), 

 hi travail de creusement, qui s'effectue certainomont dans des pro- 

 portions plus ou moins grandes, doit etre bien plus considerable en 

 haut qu'en bas du glacier." 



La realite et I'importance de la denudation glaciaire est aujour- 

 d'hui reconnue par un grand nombre d'observateurs parmi lesquels 

 nous citerons M. Richter^ et M. W. Salomon.'"

 Mauvais Pas, coinme dans celles sur les glaciers de la Haute-Engadine 

 et de bien d'autres regions, j'ai ete frappe tie ce fait que le poli des 

 roches moutonnees qui dominent la glace, n'est pas le meine a toutes 

 les hauteurs: meme de loin, on constate, trc? netternent en bien des 

 points, qu'il est de plus en i)lus iinparfait, c'est-a-dire de plus en 

 plus alterc, ^ mesure que Ton s'eldve. En outre, la liinite sun^rieure 

 des polls est loin d'etre aussi nette que la limite superieure du glacier 

 et on voit des larnbeaux de roches polies separes de la masse gencrale 

 des roches moutonnees, situees plus bas. Ces circonstances curieuses 

 s'expliquent par la penetration verticale du glacier dans la masse 

 des roches qui le supportent, grace i\ un mecanisme identitjue, a 

 celui qui fait p^netrer dans une pierre le fil emerise du lapidaire. 

 En effet, I'age des differentes parties du polissage est loin d'etre le 

 meme: les parties hautes sont plus anciennes que les autres et, en 

 consequence, elles ont eprouvc plus longtemps Taction desagregeante 

 des intemperies; en meme temps que les roches moutonnees gagnent 

 par en bas, a cause de la jienetration verticale du glacier dans le .sob 

 elles perdent i)ar en haut, sous I'influence de rintemperismc. On 

 pent done en conclure qu'elles ont pu jadis atteindrc une aliiludt- 

 encore plus haute que celle qu'on observe aujourd'hui. De sortc 

 que le procede employe d'ordinaire pour restaurer les ancicn- glaciers 

 devrait conduire a leur donner une dimcn-^ion encore bien plus grande 

 qu'on ne la suppose.

Le glacier (jui diminue, change en meme temps de forme: il perd 

 la longue trainee qui descend vers les parties basses et se r^duit k 

 la portion elargie des regions elevees. Les Pyrenees, montagnes 

 plus anciennes que les Alpes, et qui par consequent subissent I'erosion 

 depuis plus longtemps, nous offrent cette sorte tie glaciers larges et 

 courts, s'arretant au haut de vallees etroites, dont les Hancs sont en 

 l)eaucoup d'enilroits parfaitement moutonnes et le long desquelles 

 se montrent des moraines transversales, echelonnees de distance en 

 distance, ce qui imlique avec evidence que le glacier y a sejourne 

 dans I'intervalle de ses raccourcissements successifs. Imaginons les 

 Pyrenees remises en possession de tout ce qu'elles ont perdu depuis 

 leur soulevement, leurs sommets se retrouveraient dans les zones 

 atmospherif|ues de fortes condensations n(;igeuses, et les cirques,. 

 mieux alimentes, reconstitueraient des glaciers semblables a ceux 

 des Alpes. 



Apres le stade alpestre et le stade pyreneen, nous arrivons au stade 

 vosgien. 



Si Ton part de la petite vill(> de La Bresse, pour remonter la vallee 

 du C'hajoux, en se rapprochant du sommet de Hohneck, on se trouve 

 d'abord en presence de particularites topographiques tout a fait 

 comparables a celles que nous ofTre le bas des valines des Pyrenees. 

 De magnificiues moraines se presentent aux regards, d'autant plus 

 faciles k reconnaitre qu'elles ont ete recoup^es par la riviere et 

 entaillees pour le passage de la route. Sur le flanc des coteaux,. 

 accidentellement depouilles du sol arable, on aper^oit des surfaces 

 de roches nettement moutonn^es. Mais, on a beau continuer son 

 ascension, jusqu'au lac de Lispach, (jui s'est etabli derriere un 

 barrage morainique, et meme arriver au sommet du Hohneck, on ne

rencontre pas le moindre vestige de glace. Des plaques do neige 

 pourront se voir encore jusqu'en aout, dans les creux abrites du soleil; 

 mais en septembre, elles auront toute.^ fondii. Pour qu'elles persis- 

 tassent, il suffirait d'un bien fail^ie exhausst'incnt des \'osges, d'une 

 restitution a la chaine d'une partie seulement des materiaux que 

 I'crosion lui a arraches et qui gisent, a I'etat de moraines, dans la 

 vallee du Chajoux et dans toutes les autres vallecs qui ravonnent en 

 tous sens. 



Les Vosges ont ete coninie les Pyrenees; les Pyrenees seront eonimo 

 les \'osges. 



Certaines autres regions frangaises, coinin(> la Bretagne, le Cotentin, 

 I'Auvergne, privees de glace et souvent menie de moraines, ont cepend- 

 ant possede des glaciers. On y rencontre en effet, a la surface de ter- 

 rains varies, des blocs erratiques, seml)lables a ceux que charrient les 

 glaciers et qu'ils abandonnent a leur moraine terminale. La deter- 

 mination parait d'autant plus legitime que les monts d'Arree, par 

 e.xemple, malgre leur altitude actuelle de simples collines, se revelent 

 par leur structure caracterisee, comme les residus d'erosion d'une 

 cliaine {)rimitivement batie sur le modele des Alpes. L'intem- 

 perisme a disperse les moraines, attacjue les surfaces polies des roches 

 moutonnees; il. a laisse, provisoircment, (luchiucs grns fragin(>nts 

 rocheux particulierement resistants. 



L'appareil glaciaire s'e.st done developpe successivement dans les 

 differents ma.ssifs montagneux, chacjue fois (|ue ceux-ci ont presents 

 une altitude suffisuntc pour y assurer la jiersistancc ilc la neige. 

 Succe.ssivement, les centres glaciaires ont occupe des regions diffd- 

 rentes, et Ton peut croire qu'au total, les diverses ('•poques se sont 

 tres intimement ressemble par le nombre et par le volume des glaciers 

 d(5velopp(!*s durant chacune d'elles et seulement repartis difTerenunent. 



L'emi(jralion des glaciers, comparable :\ I'emigration des continents 

 mais dont la chronologic est plus difiicile, faute de fossiles |)ermel- 

 tant de les (later, doit etre substituee i\ Ja conception d'une epoqiie

 poraines les unes des autres, oCl il y aurait eu beaucoup plus de glaciers 

 que dans aucun autre temps, ce (|ui est essentiellement contraire :\ 

 la marche, si ("'videmment continue et imiforme, de r('volution de la 

 surface terrestre. 



La capture des glaciers est un point j)arliculier el dim liaut interet 

 de leur evolution. I^a captun' est une analogic de plus, entre les

 sorte que le bassin sui)eri(^ur d<i A soit .s(?pare de la partie moyenne de

 I'ensemble du glacier A, amene raniincisscnient de la cloison separa- 

 trice en B, et plusieurs voyageurs ont directement observe le i)li6no- 

 ni^ne et en ont decrit les progres, conune sir Martin Conway, en 1898, 

 pour le Spitzberg,^- et ^I. Williard D. Johnson, pour les Etats-Unis, 

 en 1899.^3 Lorsque la destruction de cette cloison s'est enfin realisee, 

 et qu'alors le glacier A, en consequence de sa pente plus forte, exerce 

 une veritable succion sur la glace de B et la derive a son profit, B est 

 decapite, pour adopter I'expression employee a I'egard des cours d'eau, 

 et A a realise la capture de la portion superieure de B. 



Le glacier A, conform^ment a la loi generale, avait sul)i une 

 diminution consecutive a I'abaissement de son bassin d'alimentation 

 sous rinfluence de I'erosion; il avait abandonn^ sa moraine frontale 

 et en avait ^difie de nouvelles en arriere de celle-la; sur le terrain 

 glaciaire eparpill^, s'etait etabli alors un regime continental ordinaire: 

 production d'un etang ou d'une tourbiere, avec debris organiques 

 enfouis, animaux et vegetaux. Mais voici la capture qui a lieu: 

 une nouvelle contribution de glace vient s'aj outer au volume du 

 glacier: il se gonfle, passe par dessus sa moraine frontale qu'il ecrase 

 et transforme en vioraine profonde, s'avance sur la tourbiere ou sur 

 I'etang, en recouvre les formations de son d6p6t ^parpille et r6cupere 

 sa dimension primitive qu'il pent meme depasser. 



Puis la diminution ineluctable reprend ses droits; le glacier recule 

 de nouveau et finalement disparait. Et si Ton est mis en presence 

 d'une coupe du sol, interessant les diverses formations dont nous 

 avons resume la production successive, on y verra: une assise fos- 

 silifere, argileuse ou tourbeuse, contenant des coquilles lacustres, 

 des animaux et des vegetaux terrestres, intercalee entre deux niveaux 

 glaciaires: I'inferieur datant de revolution propre du glacier A, le 

 superieur se rapportant au retour de ce glacier, enrichi par la capture. 



Ces conditions se retrouvent dans un grand nombre de localites, 

 par exemple a Diirtein, a Utznach, a Wetzikon aupres de Zurich.

 s^parees par des depots d'alluvions, indiquant plusieurs cycles

 Le fait tient au nomhre de glaciers situes tlans un nienie massif

Comment tous ces faits ne nous mettraient-ils pas en garde centre

 soumises en meme temps au ph(^nomenc glaciaire; et I'erreur, cette

Les traces du grand piienomene erratique se retrouvent en Amerique

Si Ton ne voyait pas I'Atlantique a rocuvre et si Ton nc connaissait 

 que les regions europeennes et americaines couvertes de terrains 

 erratiques, on ne ferait nuUe difficulte de supposer qu'elles ont acquis 

 leurs caracteres speciaux dans un meme moment. La notion fournie 

 par I'existence de I'Atlantique montre comment I'opinion contraire 

 est plus vraisemblable et meme comment il n'y a aucune raison de 

 croire que toute la region europ6enne d'une part, et que toute la 

 region americaine de I'autre, aient subi le phenomene erratique 

 chacune d'un seul coup. Tout porte a admettre que la cause de 

 dispersion des icebergs a dii se deplacer avec le temps, en consequence 

 de la propagation progressive des bossellements generaux et de 

 r^migration de la mer.

La Question des Galets stri^is. 



La plupart de nos lecteurs verraient sans doute une lacune impar- 

 donnable dans I'oubli des galets stries parmi la serie des caracteres 

 propres aux formations glaciaires. K. von Zittel, cet esprit d'ordi- 

 naire si judicieux, est alle jusqu'^ dire: "L'indice le plus infaillible 

 de I'origine glaciaire d'une formation se trouve dans la presence des 

 cailloux stries. On ne rencontre que tr6s rarement des stries sur des 

 fragments de roches crLstallisees, de gr^s quarteux et de jaspe; par 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



centre, elles se font voir de la maniere la plus reconnaissable sur les 

 fragments calcaires, particulierenient sur ceu.x de couleur sombre. 

 Dans line moraine profonde ciui n'a pas ete remaniee et lavee par les 

 eaux, presque tous les cailloux calcaires portent des stries qui souvent 

 sont aussi profondes que si elles avaient ete gravees avec un burin. "^^ 



Tout le monde a peu pres, etait en ce temps la tlu meme avis, et 

 cette quasi-unanimite en imposait assez aux dissidents pour (juils 

 conservassent in petto les objections qui se present aient a leur esprit. 



On s'explique d'ailleurs juscju'a un certain point I'crreur qui 

 consiste h. attribuer aux stries des galets une origine glaciaire et Ton 

 comprend qu'une fois I'erreur commise on ait tenu d'instinct a la 

 conserver, parce qu'elle semi)lait un guide commode dans la recon- 

 stitution tie Thlstoire g^ologique des glaciers. 



Quant au premier de ces deux points de vue, il faut reconnaitre 

 que c'est surtout dans la masse des depots glaciaires, et avant tcjut 

 daas les moraines, que les galets stries ont 6t6 observes. Par exemple, 

 c'est sur les moraines des Vosges qu' Ed. Collomb'® a fait les obser- 

 vations, pour ainsi dire initiales, qui ont etc completees par des 

 experiences, prouvant que les galets strips passent k I'etat de galets 

 ordinaires, quand on les sommet h un frottemcnt semlilablc a celui 

 qui se developpe dans le lit tl'un cours d'eau. 



On a conclu de ces observations qu'un glacier constitue un appareil 

 des plus fragiles et que sa disparition totale doit suivre immcdiate- 

 ment I'envahissemcnt jiar la mer de la region ou il exist ait. 



La premien; action des flots a 6te sans aucun doute de demanteler 

 les moraines et d'cn laver les materiaux heterogenes. Lc frottemcnt 

 leur a fait pcrdrc les traits morphologiciucs (|ui pouvaient leur etn- 

 caracteristiques et le balancement des eaux les a repartis rapidement 

 en dei)6ts parfaitement classes, parfaitement distincts les uns des 

 autres et n'ayant plus ricn (pii jiuisse les distinguer des s^liments 

 (irdiuaircs. 



D'un autre cote, comme on retrouve (\vs galets stries au s«mii de 

 formations geologicjues d'ages trc^s divers, on a ('•te encliante, et a 

 bon droit, de croire a leur autorite pour n''veler raction glaciaire a 

 tous les moments de la vie de la Terre. 



La premiere fois qjie j'ai eu des doutes sur Torigiiie glaciaire des

 provoque do.s resistances ii I'occasion de bien iles sujets dilTercnts, 

 tels que la doctrine de la sedimentation souterraine qui me jiaralt 

 cependant de plus en plus lej^itme; tels que I'orifjiine, ])ar reactions 

 gazeuses, des roches silicatees magnesiennes de consolidation primi- 

 tive; tels que la capture des glaciers; tels que le mode de creusement 

 des vall(^es par les rivieres et la constitution du diluvium; tels que 

 le fait des relations stratigraphiques reciprcniues des divers types de 

 meteorites; tels que beaucoup d'autres qu'il n'est pas n^cessaire de 

 rappeler. 



Je dois avouer que j'eus un moment d'he-itation avant de me 

 lancer dans Texposition des faits qui me conduisirent a affirmer que, 

 si dans les Prealpes vaudoises, d'anciens glaciers ont exists, ce qui 

 est bien possible, ils n'ont laisse aucune trace de leur existence. En 

 d'autres termes, que tous les accidents consid^r^s comme des temoig- 

 nages de I'ancienne existence des glaciers dans le pays, se rattachent 

 avec evidence a des causes toutes differentes, et ne comportent pas 

 les consequences g^n^rales qu'on a cru pouvoir tirer de leur etude. 



Je n'entrerai pas ici dans le detail de mes recherches, et je donnerai 

 seulement deux observations. 



Des specimens recueillis au pied des Pleiades, au-dessus du village 

 de Blonay, a 4 kilometres au N. de Vevey (Suisse), consistent en- 

 galets de calcaire poli, presentant une prodigieuse abondance de 

 stries et une extreme variete dans leurs directions. Toutes les faces 

 de ces galets sont striees en tous sens. En outre, tous les galets 

 calcaires contenus dans le sol sont semblables a ceux-ci par I'etat de 

 leur surface; mais les roches plus dures, gres, granulites, serpentine, 

 etc., ne sont pas striees ou ne le sont cjue d'une maniere exceptionnelle 

 et avec parcimonie. 



Or, si les stries etaient I'ceuvre du glacier, leur orientation generale 

 devrait indiquer celle de la pression supposee; mais elles sont egale- 

 ment nombreuses dans tous les sens possibles. D'ailleurs, la pression 

 du terrain, aussi forte qu'on pulsse la supposer, ne saurait produire 

 que des .stries associees a des ^crasements de beaucoup pr6ponderants, 

 et c'est ce que demontre rexpericnce. 



Une autre remarque qui, k elle seule, semble r^duire a ncant 

 I'hj^pothese que les stries des galets calcaires sont dus a I'a'ction des 

 glaciers, c'e.st que si telle etait en effet leur origine, si par consequent 

 elles dataient d'une antiquite de quelques milliersd'annees seulement, 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



(et dans le pays de Vevey ce n'est pas assez dire), elles auraient 

 depuis longteinps disparu par le fait de la corrosion realisee par les 

 eaux d'infiltration. J'ai fait disparaitre en moins d'un an le poll et 

 la plup&rt des stries de galets que j 'avals abandonnes dans la terre 

 vegetale a toutes les alternatives saisonnieres. 



Une coupe rencontree sur la rive droite du torrent appele la Bale 

 de Clarens, qui descend du pied S. 0. du Mont Folly, pour se jeter 

 dans le lac Leinan, m'a procure des observations dignes de mention. 

 Les travaux d'une route joignant Blonay a Charnex, avaient n^cessite 

 I'ouverture d'un enorine placage de terrain cailloutcux, recoupe 

 en face de Brent, suivant la pente du sol, par une tranchee de 200 

 metres de longueur et dont les parois montraient le contact d'une 

 surface tres inclincc de roches schisteuses, avec recouvrement dpais 

 de terrain cailloutcux. 



Cette ligne de contact est tres inegalement inclin^e selon les 

 points: tandis cjue, dans cortaines de ses parties, elle plongo tres 

 vite, dans d'autres, au contraire, elle est bien mqins eloignee de la 

 direction horizontale. Et la consequence, c'est que les eaux d'infil- 

 tration ruissellent dans la masse avec une activity tres inegalc ici 

 et la, et (jue le travail de la denudation souterraine est d'etre loin 

 d'etre unifornic dun i)()int a I'autre. 



Dans le i)r('ini('r cas, et toutes t-hoses egales d'ailleurs, on voit la 

 boue beaucoup moins al)ondante, pendant que les galets calcaires 

 sont trds exactement polls et tres richement .strips; au contraire, 

 dans I'autre cas, on obs«'rve des intervalles de niveaux limoneux et 

 un exc^s de boue qui, bien loin de ])resenter la structure (\os moraines, 

 permet de retrouver des formes de deltas superpo.s6s. En meme 

 temps, on reconnait (jue les stries font a pen pres defaut sur les galets 

 calcaires. 



Nous avons prononc*' le- tnots "dt'nudation soutcrrMinc " C'e.st 

 \h cju'rn <'fT('t, est la cause des .--tries sur les g;ilets calcaires. 



Beaucoup des caracteres morphologiciues de la surfa<"c du sol lui 

 viennent d'actions .souterraines dont ils sont le contre-coup. 



I'lie partie des eaux ccturantcs s'infiltre dans la terre vegetale 

 pour s'^couler a la surface de la roclie sr)us-jacente. (^uand la pente 

 est convenai)le, recoMJeinenf (h'-terniine, ru.>ure de ce substraluni,

18 PROCEEDINGS OF THK ACADKMY OF [Jan., 



Dans les pays i\ forte pente, cctte d(5nudation soutorraine, toute 

 voisine de la surface du sol, prend des caraeteres extremement 

 interessants. Pour observer les faits avec leur maximum de nettet6 

 il faut choisir une locality dont la roche vive soit reeouverte de ces 

 placagcs boueux a pierrailles de toutes les grosseurs, comme dans 

 I'exemple que nous venons de citer. 



Ces placages, quoique k base argileuse, sont cependant bien 

 perm6al)les, a cause du sable quartz(>ux cju'ils contiennent en pro- 

 portion tres notable et des blocs rocheux qui y sont diss6min6s; 

 aussi I'eau d'infiltration y circule-t-elle avec une assez grande facility. 

 Sous 1 'influence du liquide en mouvement, le terrain subit des 

 pertes qui derivent, les unes d'une dissolution de substances calcaires 

 dans I'acide carbonique de I'eau de pluie, les autres d'un entrainement 

 m^canique de particules argileuses qui troublent I'eau d'une fagon 

 tres visible a la base des pentes et la rendent meme tout a fait boueuse, 

 quand les pluies sont fortes et prolong^es. 



La perte de matiere qui provient de cette double cause est tres 

 notable et elle determine necessairement un tassement sur elle-meme 

 de la matiere restante, qui glisse en meme temps sur la roche suppor- 

 tant le placage boueux et qui, comme nous I'avons vu, est ici forte- 

 ment inclinee. 



Dans ce mouvement de contraction du terrain, il s'inflige pour 

 ainsi dire a lui-meme une nouvelle forme de la denudation souterraine. 

 A cause de son heterogeneite, le deplacement relatif de ses grains 

 durs et de ses Elements plus tendres amene I'usure de ceux-ci, et 

 souvent cette usure se manifesto par 1' acquisition de details mor- 

 pholologiques des plus remarquables. 



Les grains de quartz de toutes grosseurs, se mouvant tres lente- 

 ment, mais d'une maniere continue, contre les fragments calcaires, 

 contribuent k les user. 



Ces fragments calcaires, d'abord tres anguleux, comme on le voit 

 dans les parties hautes de la region, s'emoussent peu a pcu sous 

 I'influence des actions si bien connues et qui tendent a supprimer 

 dans les roches qui les subissent toutes les parties saillantes pour y 

 substituer des contours arondis. Si bien qu'un cube ne tarderait 

 pas k passer k une sphere plus ou moins parfaite et que des polyedres 

 quelconques marchent vers I'etat d'ellipsoides. II y a longtemps 

 que j'ai insiste sur ce mode de production de galets sans charriage.'^

souterraine et qui fait pen a peu des galets avec des blocs anguleux, 

 se complique de la collaboration de ce deplacement intestin des 

 grains de quartz par rapport aux del^ris calcaires sous rinfluence de 

 la denudation souterraine. 



En conseciuence de la soustraction de substance solul^le ou entrain- 

 able r^alisee par I'eau d'infiltration, ces petits grains de quartz se 

 meuvent sur la surface des blocs, lentement mais d'une fagon continue, 

 et avec une pression cjui est mesuree par le poids du terrain superpos^. 

 II en resulte que les surfaces convenablement tendres et avant tout, 

 les surfaces de calcaire compacte, se polissent verital)lcment: comme 

 elles se poliraient sous I'inHuence d'une niolette. dans un atelier de 

 niarbrier. 



Ce poli se renouvelle sans cesse: un galet poli enfoui dans la tcrre 

 arable exposee a la jiluie perd en tres peu ile temps sa surface carac- 

 teristique, il se ternit, il se corrode. Et c'est pour cela cjue nous 

 pouvions tout h I'heure dire que, si de semblables galets avaient 6t6 

 polls par les glaciers cjuaternaires dans les j^lacages ou on les trouve 

 maintenant, il y a un temps incalculal)le qu'ils auraient perdu le poli 

 auquel on pretend les reconnaitre. . Mais dans leurs gisements, k 

 mesure qu'ils sont attaques, i!s se polissent de nouveau et cela sans 

 arret. Si la grande masse des petits grains quartzeux arrive a polir et 

 a entretenir polls sous toutes leurs faces, les galets calcaires contenus 

 dans les placages boueux des Prealpcs, certains grains tic meme 

 nature, mais de plus forte dimension, y impriment leur contact sous 

 la forme de stries ou de rainures plus ou moins longues et plus ou 

 incjins profondes. Or c'est a cause des cailloux stri(^s cjue certains 

 g^ologues ont essayd de faire considerer les placages boueux des 

 Prealpes comme 6tant d'origine glaciaire. Mais il y a impossibility 

 ji. .soutenir cette opinion, par les meines raisons invcujuccs deji t\ 

 Toccasion des galets observes dans la masse d'ancicnncs moraines 

 comme celles des V'osges. L'une des plus determinantc, c'est I'abon- 

 dance meme des stries, leur j)resence sur tous les galets calcaires sans 

 exception et sur toutes les faces de ces galets. Involontairement. 

 et malgre le respect que doit nous inspirer le nom de certains des 

 geologues glacialistes (pie nous combattoiis, (»n lie pent se df^'fendre 

 d'un certain etonuement (piaut au sueres d'une ddclrine si insoute-

 ont donnee aux rochcs qui out suhi Icur friction. En vertu dcs 

 circonstancos nieutionnees pour Ics galcts, la surface moutonnee a

 constainincnt comme celui dcs galcts. Enfin, cctte roche a 6t^,

 longs, plus ou moins nombreux, et tout cet ensemble reproduit dans 

 ses traits gcncraux les cffcts dct(>rniincs jxir Ic passage dcs glaciers; — 

 car il va sans dire que si les galcts sont inijiui-ssants a stricr les galets, 

 ils sont au eontraire tres aptes k strier, a canneler et a polir les roches 

 en place qui Ics support cnt. 



Mais un fait niontrcra a lui scul qu'il y a en jeu une cause essen- 

 tiellement diff^rente d'un cas a I'autre. 



Rectifiant, il y a quekiucs annces une route qui va de Glion au 

 Mont Caux, on attaqua des placagcs boueux a galets strics et, dans 

 un point, on mit a nu une magnifique surface calcaire moutonnee, 

 polie et striee, offrant tous les caracteres glaciaircs, du moins aux 

 3'eux de geologues trop prevenus pour voir sainement les faits. Or, 

 on reconnut que cette surface etait seulement la partie superieure 

 d'un enorme bloc de plusieurs metres cubes, noye dans le placage 

 boueux, et Ton voyait tres nettement, dans certains points de ses 

 surfaces lat^rales et meme de sa surface inferieure, quej'ai pu aise- 

 ment degager en un point, la reproduction exacte du meme poll et 

 de la meme striation. Cette pierre etait done un gigantesque galet 

 pareil aux autres; elle avait ^te polie et striee ainsi en glissant avec 

 une grande lenteur sur le terrain boueux sous-jacent. 



En outre, dans la region de la surface polie, qui semblait bien 

 "etre en place," on voyait le poll et les stries, meme dans les depres- 

 sions, sans qu'on put trouvcr nullc part une de ces zones preservees 

 du frottement, comme il y en a dans toutes les surfaces glaciaircs. 



Une objection qui se presente a I'esprit contre la production des 

 strics par denudation souterraine, c'est la pretenduc impermeabilite 

 du terrain argileux a galets polls dcs Prealpes et des regions analogues. 

 Or, cette impermeabilite est absolument illusoire: dans toute la 

 region des Prealpes que j'ai etudiee, les placages se comportent 

 comme de veritables reservoirs hydrauliques et de leur epaisseur 

 sourdent d'innombrables sources parfois volumineuses. Ces sources, 

 si visibles aupres de Blonnay, de Brent, des Avants, etc., sont essen- 

 tiellement incrustantes. A Blonnay, il faut souvent remplacer, pour

cause d'obstruction travertineuse, les tuyaux de conduite etablis 

 pour capter ces eaux: j'en ai recueilli des echantillons tres demon- 

 stratifs. Aux Avants et entre cette station climaterique et Mon- 

 treux, la tuffiere et d'autres monticules, repr^sentent des ainas de 

 calcaire concretionne emis par les placages. II y en a un spccialement 

 net au lieu dit Sex que pliau (la pierre qui pleut) au-dessus d'En 

 Saumont, non loin de I'Alliaz; des feuilles et des coquilles terrestres 

 y ont lais.se des moulages parfait^. 



J'ai pu assister veritablement a la production progressive du poli 

 a la surface des blocs calcaires compris dans les eboulis, en etudiant 

 successiveraent des escarpement choisis de plus en plus loin des 

 sommets des Prealpes. Vers Sotodoz (1800 metres), au pied des 

 Rochers de Naye, les fragments rocheux dont il s'agit sont nettement 

 anguleux et n'ont rien pour attirer I'attention; vers I'altitude du 

 Mont-C'aux. les aretes vives et les parties anguleuses sont deja 

 (levenucs tres rares et les blocs polls sont deja tre> nombreux; leur 

 maximum se trouve depuis les Avants jusqu'a Blonnay. Plus bas, 

 la forme du pays cesse d'etre favorable au gli.s.sement indispensable 

 h la production (\n\ nous occupe et Ton ne voit aucun galet. 



Je suis arrive a reproduire par I'experience le phenomene de stria- 

 tion souterraine des galets et des surfaces rocheuses par un dispositif 

 tres simple. 



II etait n^ces.saire de modifier les conditions nuturcUes tout en leur 

 lai&sant leur caractere essentiel, de fa^on a leur faire produire un 

 effet rapide et plus tangible. Pour cela, deux choses s'imposaient: 

 1° recourir a une substance beaucoup ])lus facile a rayer que le cal- 

 caire, puisque les forces mises en oeuvre allaient etre incomparablement 

 plus faibles (|ue celles qui interviennent dans les plKMioiuenes naturels; 

 — 2° provoquer dans le sous-sol soumis a la denudation, des mouve- 

 ments plus accentu^s, afin de provoquer des r^sultats plus rapides. 

 [Le premier point a conduit a employer des repn'scntations des galets 

 en piatrc moule, parfaitement lisses et polls. Pour cela on rcmplit 

 de pldtre g^ch6 de consistance trds liquide, de petits ballons de vcrre, 

 les uns sph^'^rifjues et les autres ellipsoidaux, c'est-j\-(iire du modi^le 

 dit doTi matras d'essayeur. I'ne fois le plat re bien pris, on brise le 

 verre avec precaution, k moins (juii ne sc brise de lui-meinc par 

 dilatation du plAtre. et on enleve les fragments avec beaucoup (Jt; 

 .soin [)(>ur ne pas produire de rayures. 



Ia; .second point a conduit h adopter comme substance constitutive 

 du sol artificiel, dans la masse (hujUel la striation devra se faire, un 

 melange, h volumes «'gaux, de .sable (juartz eux pjis trop fin et de gros

 favorables i\ I'effet dc'^sir^. 



Le melange de sable et tie sel est placd dans une l:)oite rectangu- 

 laire en bois, et j'ai d'ordinaire employ6 10 kilogrammes de sel et 

 le volume correspondant de sable. Pendant le remplissage, qui se 

 fait avec une pelle, on place successivement dans le m<51ange pul- 

 verise, les boules de plAtre, de fa^on k ne point les f rotter et par 

 consequent i\ ne point rayer leur surface, (^uand la caisse est bien 

 pleine, on d(!>pose sur le melange une planchette qu'on surcharge d'un 

 poids de 20 a 30 kilogrammes. II n'y a plus qu'^ fairc arriver au 

 contact de la substance, un filet d'eau qui pent venir soit d'en haut, 

 soit d'en bas, soit lateralement, pour avoir des effets tres varies de 

 tassements, avec glissements en sens divers. Apres la dissolution 

 tot ale du sel, on arrete I'experience, on laisse ^goutter, on ouvre la 

 boite, en emp^chant tout deplacement de son contenu et, avec les 

 precautions les plus minutieuses, on extrait les boules qui sont 

 lavees avec un jet d'eau et mises a s6cher. 



On observe alors a leur surface des paquets de stries qui ont avec 

 celles des galets calcaires des placages boueux, les analogies les plus 

 frappantes et les plus instructives. 



C'est ainsi que les stries sont dirigces indifferemment dans tous les 

 sens et le me me spheroide peut en presenter en plusieurs directions. 

 Apres une seule experience, elles sont peu nombreuses, mais on les 

 multiplie ais^ment en remettant successivement les memes boules 

 de platre dans I'appareil. 



On peut aussi y placer une dalle plane en platre convenablement 

 inchnee et obtenue par moulage dans une cuvette de porcelaine. 

 Apres I'ecoulement on y voit des stries qui presentent le caractere 

 tres remarquable d'etre frequemment interrompues et parfois k 

 plusieurs reprises, comme le sont de leur cote les stries naturellcs. 



La conclusion de ces remarques et de ces experiences a d'autant 

 plus d'importance que le terrain £1 galets stries, jouit d'une aire de 

 dispersion gigantesque. On le retrouve, pareil a celui des Alpes 

 dans les contreforts de toutes les grandes chaines comme les Pyrenees, 

 les Carpathes, le Cauca.se, I'Himalaya,^** les Montagnes Rocheuses, 

 etc. M. Roussanoff, membre de la mission de M. le comte B6nard,

 galets calcaires et schisteux, polis et stries, provenant de la Nouvelle-

 des Prealpes vaudoises. II faiulra, ciuekiue jour, refaire toutes les 

 cartes de ces dernieres regions pour supprimer la qualification de 

 glaciaire donnee a cette formation. 



Des faits compl^tement concordants avec ceux que j'ai d^crits ont 

 ^t6 signales par le g^>ologue anglais Bonney.^ En en resumant ses 

 resultats^i M. Marcellin Boule a bien voulu ajouter: "On ne pent 

 reprocher ^ M. Bonney que d'avoir oublie de, citer les travaux 

 importants de M. Stanislas Meunier sur le memo sujet. Depuis 

 longtemps, en effet, le savant professeur du Museum a montre qu'on 

 prenait souvent dans les Alpes pour des moraines des accumulations 

 de blocs et de boues dont I'origine est pr(5cisement celle qu'indique 

 le geologue anglais. M. Stanislas Meunier va meme plus loin. II a 

 montre par de curieuses experiences de laboratoire que les cailloux 

 stries eux-memes peuvent se trouver dans les pseudo-moraines. Je 

 suis heureux de rappeler ici les titres cU; priorite de M. Stanislas 

 Meunier au sujet d'une question qui est pour nous dv la plus haute 

 importance."

 les formations glaciaires devra y etre remplac^ par celui qu'il faudra

NOTES ON THE SEMELID5: OF THE WEST COAST OF AMERICA, INCLUDING 



SOME NEW SPECIES. 



BY WILLIAM II. DALL. 



In revising the Pacific Coast species in the National Collection, 

 considerable confusion was found, due in part to the habit of Dr. 

 Carpenter (who ori<;inally named the collection) of trusting to the 

 spechnens in the collection of Professor C. B. Adams rather than to 

 the diagnoses of that careful author. The specimens in that collec- 

 tion, due to several causes (especially the fact that they were kept 

 loose in trays and not numbered), have in some cases since Professor 

 Adams' death become transposed or mixed, so that, without careful 

 reference to the text, errors of identification were likely to occur. 



Furthermore, the collection of the National Museum since Car- 

 penter's time has been greatly enlarged, and the better and more 

 numerous specimens from a much wider geographical range afford 

 an (opportunity for study not available to Dr. Carpenter. 

 Semele deoisa Conrad. 18.37. 



San Pedro to San Diego, California. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This species is also reported from Mazatlan and Tagus Cove, 

 Calapagos Islands, but I am not able to confirm these localities. 

 Semele solida Cray, 1828. 



IVru and Chile. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus.) 



This is also doubtfully reported from the Galapagos Islan<ls. It 

 is the crocea of Gould, 1850, and the orbicularis of Hup6, 1854. 

 Semele corrngata Sowrrby, 1832. 



Not of C. B. Adams, 1852; and probably the californica of A. 

 Adams, 185.'J. 



Magdalena Bay, Lower California, to I(iui(|ii(', Peru. (Coll. 

 U. S. N. Mu.^.) 



It is possibly only a variety of the preceding or the fi)llowiiig species. 

 Semele flavescens Could, IS.^jI. 



Cape St. Lucas to Callao, Peru. (Coll. I'. S. N. .Mus.) 



This is the proxinm of C. B. Adams, 1852, and the Jlavicans of 

 Carpenter (1857, lapsus) as of Ck»u1<1. 

 Semele itriosa C H Adunv.. 1h.'.2

 Semele sparsilineata n sp. 



Panama, 18 fathoms. (Coll. U. S. N. Mus., Xo. %,2G9.) 



Chile, Hup^. 



This was confused by Hujid with S. vuricgata Lam., 1818, which 

 it nmch resembles, but is easily discriminated from the Atlantic 

 species by the much sparser oblique grooving. The best specimen 

 in the National Collection is 15 by 10 mm., with the vertical from 

 the beaks 0.5 nun. behind the anterior end; but the shell grows much 

 larger. 



Semele bicolor C B. Adams, 1852. 



Culf of California to Panama. (Coll. U. 8. N. Mus.) 

 A thin orbicular species with distinctive purple suffusion on a 

 white ground. 



Semele rupicola n. sp. 



This is Semele rupinm of California authors following Carpenter; 

 not of Sowerby, 1832. 



Santa Cruz, California, to the Gulf of California. (Coll. U. S. N. 

 Mus.) 



The Galapagos species, for which this has been mistaken, when 

 not distorted by its nestling habit, has a conspicuous furrow radiating 

 from the beak and rostrating the posterior end, and the form of the 

 pallial sinus is different from that of the North American form. 

 The former character is absent in the latter shell, but they are 

 otherwise much alike. 

 Semele rubropicta Dall. 1S71.

Semele regularis n. sp. 



Gulf of California, off La Paz. in 10 to 30 fathoms. (Coll. U. S. N. 

 Mus., No. 76,433.) 



This is a thin, delicate, usually pure white species of elliptical 

 outline, sculptured with low, olituse, concentric lamella?, regularly 

 disposed, with fine concentric lineation between them and no trace 

 of radial striation. The beaks are nearly central and the pallial 

 sinus is high, short, subcircular, and hardly extends bcliind the 

 vertical of the beaks. Some specimens have a faint orange flush 

 internally. The most perfect specimen measures 22 mm. long, 

 17 mm. high, and (5 ram. in diameter. The umbo is about 12 mm. 

 behind the anterior end. Fragments show that the shell grows at 

 least one half larger. 

 Semele pacifica n. sp. 



Catalina Island, California, to Acapulco, Mexico, in 9 to 21 fathoms. 

 (Coll. U. S. X. Mus., Xo. 211.728.) 



This is the shell usually referred to S. cancellata Sowerby, 1830 

 (.S. bellastriata Conrad, 1837), but which differs from that Atlantic 

 species in its smaller lunule, shorter and weaker right lateral tooth, 

 and sharper and more tlelicate concentric sculpiure. It is a rare 

 form and doubtless the two descend from the same Oligocenc ances- 

 tors. 

 Semele incongrua Carpfnt<r, 1803.

 (Coll. U. S. X. Mu<.) 



This is a well-defined sj)ccic<, and the Pliocene shell named >'.

Shell small, thin, white, finely coneentrieally sculptured, giving 

 the surface a silky look; the concentric lines slightly prominent on 

 the dorsal part of the posterior end: beaks not prominent, slightly 

 anterior, outline elongate, attenuated and pointed behind, rounded 

 in front; with only faint traces of microscopic radial striae or none; 

 hinge normal, right cardinal tooth bifid, anterior right lateral stout, 

 very short, posterior feeble, longer; l(>ft valve with a bifid cardinal 

 and no laterals; pallial sinus obscure. Length 9, height 5.5, diameter 

 3.0 mm. 



This is the first species of the genus reported from the Pacific 

 Coast. It was collected l)y Dr. Edward Palmer. 

 Abra tepocana n. sp. 



Off Cape Tepoca, Lower California, in 14 fathoms. (U. S. N. Mus., 

 No. 108,552.) 



Shell small, white, equivalve, anterior end longer; surface with 

 a dull silky lu.stre due to extremely minute concentric striation; 

 beaks rather prominent; dorsal margins descending, anterior end 

 rounded evenly into a gently arcuate base, posterior end narrower, 

 blunt, hardly truncate, slightly bent to the right as in a Macoma; 

 right valve with a conspicuous resilifer, a very small cardinal tooth 

 and the laterals obsolete; left valve with the cardinal hardly per- 

 ceptible and no lateral lamina?; pallial sinus large, 5.6 mm. deep, 

 rounded in front. Length 8, height 6, diameter 3.5 mm., the 

 beaks behind the anterior end 5 mm. 



Abra palmeri n. sp. 



Ballenas Lagoon on the west coast of Lower California; the 

 Gulf of California (Dr. E. Palmer); and Panama Bay in 26 fathoms 

 (U. S. N. Mus.). Type locality, Panama Bay. (U. S. N. Mus., 

 No. 96,30L) 



Shell short, high, inflated, white, with a silky surface, and a very 

 thin, polished, pale yellow periostracum ; anterior end and base 

 rounded; beaks subcentral, dorsal margins descending, posterior 

 end attenuated and with the extremity rounded; right valve with a 

 deeply bifid (or double) cardinal tooth, the laterals obsolete; left 

 valve with a single cardinal and no laterals. Length 10, height 8, 

 diameter 5.5 mm. The pallial sinus rounded, 6 mm. deep. 



This species is nearest to A. lioica Dall, of the Atlantic Coast of 

 the United States.

NOTES ON THE WATER SNAKE NATRIX COMPRESSICAUDA. 

 BY T. BARBOUR AND G. K. NOBLE. 



Xatrix compressicnuda^ and its four hitlierto descril)ed subspecies are 

 confined wholly to Florida, where they inhabit the brackish lagoons 

 and estuaries of the sea. Since specimens of this water snake are rare 

 in collections, the sy.stematic relationships of the several forms have 

 not been thorouiEjhly determined and any data on this suliject should 

 be of interest. Having examined some fifteen adults and a brood 

 of fifteen young from the collection of the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoolog>', we have found a remarkable variability in individuals 

 from the same locality, while those from different localities have not 

 .shown any peculiar characters correlated with their distribution. 

 The young from one brood are dichromatic and show many of the 

 .same variations as the adults, and seem to make it certain that 

 there is but a single variable form to be recognized. 



Mr. A. G. Reynolds, of Gulf port, Fla., who has cijllectetl a large 

 proportion of the known specimens of Xatrix coniprcssicauda, is 

 familiar with this variability of color in fresh specimens. In a letter 

 of September 23, 1914, he writt-s: 



"I have never found it anywhere except in brackish or salt water. 

 Its local name is the 'salt-water moccjisin. ' The fishermen occa- 

 sionally find it plentiful among the k?ys, but they never get me any 

 specimens, although I offer a good [)rice for them. It seems to be 

 more or le.ss plentiful at Key West. Here we get a straw-ccjlored 

 variety, also a variety with one row of spots beneath, and a variety 

 with three rows of s[)ots beneath." 



With the exception of one specimen, the entire series in our col- 

 lection was taken by Mr. A. (J. Reynolds. All but one of these 

 hnvv. been taken within the last few years and come from different 

 parts of the region of Tampa Hay and Key West. One of the 

 Tampa Bay specimens, kindly loaned for examination by the Academy 

 of Natural Sciences of IMiiiadelphJa, c()mes from Tarpon Springs 

 and was collected by S. N. Rlmdes, in ISIKi. The otlier> frnm this 

 region were taken at St. Petersburg by Mr. Keynolds.

Of the Key West specimens there is one (M. C. Z. 2,444) worthy 

 of special note. Cope- says in speakinji; of .V. c. conipsold'inn: 



"The only known specimen of this subspecies was found at Key 

 West, Florida, and is preserved in the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoolojj>', Cambridge, Mass." 



The specimen to which Cope refers cannot now be found in tiie 

 museum. The only example which nii^ht Ix' mistaken for it is 

 No. 2,444. But this specimen came with anotiier (M. C. Z. 2,44(5) 

 of the same species, which also seems to have disappeared. Both 

 were said to have been collected in the Florida Keys and prol)al)ly 

 at Key West by L. F. ile Pourtales. They were given by him to the 

 museum and were entered in the register by S. Garman in 1874. 



That No. 2,444 cannot possibly have served Cope as the type of 

 his A\ c. conipsohmia is shown by several noteworthy discrepancies. 

 The tail and Ijody lengths of the specimen (No. 2,444) are each some 

 hundred millimeters longer than was Cope's type, and the dorsal 

 rows are 21 as against the 19 given by Cope. Furthermore, the 

 head shield characters of the two specimens are not the same. 



Cope's type was probably not returned by him to the museum, 

 and wide inquiry elsewhere has failed to locate it. Unfortunately, 

 this is not the only specimen which suffered this fate. 



The Described Forms. 



Cope^ sums up the characters of the several races in respect to 

 color as follows: 



''.Y. c. compressicauda (Kennicott): numerous dark cross bands, 

 which are resolved into three rows of spots just anterior to the tail, 

 and four longitudinal stripes on the neck. 



"A', c. kenlata Cope:'* four series of longitudinal spots above, those 

 of the median pair forming two longitudinal stripes on the greater 

 part of the length; the laterals forming stripes on the neck only. 



"A', c. walkeri (Yarrow):" yellowish with narrow brown bands, no 

 postocular band. 



"A\ c. obscura Lonnberg:^ sooty above with transverse bands an- 

 teriorly. 



"A', c. compsoloema (Cope):^ above blackish brown with numerous 

 elo.sely placed cross bands."

Lastly, a glance shows that the type locality of these "races" an; 

 all in the same faunal area. Two of the races came originally from 

 Tamjju Hay and two from Key West, while the remaining oiu- \v:is 

 from the opposite side of Florida, taken at Volusia.

Trying to classify the fifteen a<lults under the five descril)ed races, 

 w<' find that none conform in every detail to any one race, but. that 

 each one pn-sents some of the characters from more than one "sub- 

 .species." Eight of these adults are from Tampa Hay, the other 

 seven from Kej' West. 



The coloration of the adults shows a gradual change dorsally from 

 the dark brown to the light straw-eoloretj pluuses and from the wide 




32 PROCEEDINGS OF THK .\( ADKMY (JF [Jan., 



to the narri)\v-l)and(Hl comlitions; ventrally troin the two-lined form 

 to one with a single row of spots anteriorly. The longitudinal 

 stripes on the neck and the oblique body stripes typical of X. c. 

 com pre fisi Cauda are well definetl on two specimens l)efore us from 

 St. Petersburg. There is another specimen from the same region 

 which approaches A', c. walkeri in characteristic ground tone and 

 markings. Init the dorsal surface is darker and there is a vestige of 

 the neck stripes found in .V. c. compressicauda and X. c. tccniaia. 

 One Key West specimen follows the description of .V. c. compsolcema 

 almost exactly, while four others from Key West form distinct steps 

 toward the typical walkeri pattern and coloration. Eliminating 

 the three specimens from St. Petersburg, Tampa Bay, and the one 

 from Key West which have a uniform straw-color and leaving out 

 the one specimen from Key West that approaches A' . c. obscura and 

 which may be considered as melanistic, we have ten specimens 

 remaining which seem to show a gradual change in pattern and color 

 from X. c. compressicauda, through A', c. tceniata, X. c. compsolcema, 

 to A', c. icalkeri. Throughout this series no one character is dis- 

 tinctive enough to separate a race, although the Key West specimens 

 all show a darker ventral surface. The straw-colored form is uniform 

 and therefore has no distinguishing color characters, but the sooty 

 variety approaching A', c. obscura seems to be a melanistic form of 

 A^. c. compsoloema, since its spots and faint bars have that arrangement. 

 The scale rows of the adult specimens present as pronounced a 

 variation: there is no correlation between the color patterns and 

 the number of scales and the counts given by Cope cannot be taken 

 as differential characters of separate races. Two of the specimens 

 before us have twenty-three dorsal rows, yet one has a color pattern 

 typical of X. c. compressicauda while the other approaches A'', c. 

 walkeri. The range of the scale counts of the Tampa Bay specimens 

 is expressed by the formula: 



68-83 ' 

 and the average is : 



21.3^'^-^

The Key West specimens, on the other hand, have the range of 

 and the average of

It is noteworthy that the sooty specimen like -V. c. obscura in 

 color has a very high scale count, it being 21 ' , but since several 



ol 



other counts are nearly as large no significance can be placed on this. 

 As only two of the fifteen specimens are females, and since these 

 have average body scale counts, no sex differentiation is shown. 



In the relative length of the body and tail the adult specimens 

 var>' greatly from the described foriiLs. For example, the one 

 specimen which follows so closely the description of the color of 

 .V. c. compsolcvma, and which also came from Key West, has for its 

 body-tail proportions 27.1%; Cope, on the other hand, gives meas- 

 urements of 21.5%. The Tampa Bay specimens check up lower in 

 average than the Key West ones. The range for the former l)eing 

 22.6%-25.4%, average 24.1%, while the latter is 24.8-28.2%, average 

 26.1%. Since there is an overlapping of the high numbers of the 

 former and the low ones of the latter and since the range of the 

 whole series is not very great, races cannot be separated. 



In the same way, the head scutation of the adults show great 

 variation. For example, two of the male specimens from Key West 

 {A and B) have a color pattern very similar to .V. c. walkeri, their 

 dorsal rows are both twenty-one, yet they differ considerably as 

 shown l)elow. Another specimen (C) from St. Petersljurg is very 

 similar to -V. c. compressicauda in color pattern, it has twenty-three 

 dorsal rows, yet its head characters are like those of (B).

In regard to the geographical distribution of these "fortns," we 

 have already spoken of their liniiteil ran^e. Althou{2;h the museum 

 has a series from Tampa Bay and Key West, no topotype of A'^. c. 

 tfeniata is at hand Nevertheless, some of the specimens before us 

 from Tanijia Bay and Kej' West show most of the characters of this 

 j^upposed race. 



The Brood of Young. 



The variability in color characters of the adults finds correlation 

 in a brood of fifteen young bom from a specimen similar to the 

 typical X. c. compressicauda. The mother was taken alive by 

 Mr. A. G. Reynolds and the young were born in captivity. They 

 are distinctly dichromatic; one group, ten in number, being like the 

 adult but with generally lighter ground color — in other words, 

 apjiroaching A^. c. walkeri — while the others, five in number, are 

 uniformly straw-color, as seen in some of the other adults. The 

 ol)lique dorsal bands of the young vary somewhat in width, but 

 there is not as much variation as we see in the adults. In fact, the 

 young of this brood present in color only two or possibly three of 

 the phases which are seen in the older individuals. 



In comparing the scutation of the young water snakes, on the 

 other hand, we find a great variability of the head shields and the 

 body scale counts. The dorsal rows have a constant number, 

 twenty-one, the same as the mother. The range of the ventral- 

 subcaudal scale count is: 



126 132 129.06 



68 ~ 82 ' ^^"^^S" '7I:T 



Since six of this brood are females and four of these six have low 

 counts while two have high ones, no general statement can be made 

 on sex differentiation. Turning to the head shields, we find almost 

 as much variation as in the adults. The range of these characters 

 in the brood is: 



Labiak «+8 9+" 



Oculars 



Temporals 



The average count would be: 



T 1 • 1 8+8 n 1 3+2 

 ^^"^^'"^^ 10+10' ^'^^^^^ 1 + 1 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 35 



Regarding the relative length of body and tail, we would expect 

 the proportion to run rather low since the brood comes from Tampa 

 Bay. But this is not the case. The range is 25.5%-27.8%, average 

 27.1%. 



From this it may be seen that but one race of Natrix compressi- 

 Cauda can be recognized.

ON CERTAIN VESICLES FOUND IN THE INTEGUMENT OF ANTS, 



BY ADELE AI. FIELDE. 



During the years 1900 to 1907, I demonstrated by ej^periments, 

 duly set forth in print, that the antennie of the ant are a pair of 

 compound noses, certain segments having each a special function. 

 The ants in my formicaries were subject to observation by day and 

 by night, all the year round. The experiments were unhurried, 

 very numerous, and with adequate material for every series. No 

 ant that had not manifestly recovered normal health after the 



required surgical operation was 

 engaged in the service demanded 

 by an experiment. (See b, page 

 425, and j, page 215.)^ 



I found that the habitual activi- 

 ties of the ants are guided mainly 

 by diverse odors, produced by the 

 ants themselves, and discerned 

 through the sub-noses of the olfac- 

 tory organs, the funicles of the 

 antennae. 



These odors are: (1) the odor of 

 the domicile, the nest aura, made 

 up of the commingled odors of the 

 inhabitants, and discerned through 

 the air by the distal segment of the 

 antenna. The normal ant, warned 

 by an alien aura, fears and avoids 

 the habitation of any ant com- 

 munity other than her own, and 

 she strives to flee or hide when 

 forcibly introduced into the alarm- 

 ing atmosphere of an unknown 

 nest. But if the twelfth, the distal segment, is eliminated, the ant 

 no longer distinguishes the domiciliary odor and stays fearlessly in 



^-^ 



' See bibliography at conclusion of paper. 




191o.] NATl-RAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 37 



the abode of her enemies until her life pays the penalty of her uncon- 

 scious temerity. This sub-nose appears to discern many odors, 

 diffused in the air. (See c, page 539.) 



(2) It is well known that ants of the same species abide in different 

 colonies or communities so hostile to one another that an encounter 

 between members of different colonies results in a battle, often 

 prolonged until one or the other is exterminated. The undeveloped 

 young of one colony are sometimes stolen and reared by the adults 

 of another colony of the same species, but the adults of different 

 colonies ordinarily maintain a mutual repugnance that is invincil)le, 

 no matter how long an artificially enforced companionship may 

 exist. The colony odor, depending on age, is discerned through 

 the penultimate segment of the antenna. When this segment is 

 eliminatetl, ants of different colonies of the same species live and 

 work together in complete accord. They are then unaware of the 

 oi)jecti<jnal^le odor of their comrades, as they no longer perceive 

 what the normal ant tliscerns. The colony odor is discerned through 

 contact of the antenna with the body of the ant subject to examina- 

 tion. This eleventh segment is, or contains, an organ of chemical 

 sense which might be called olfactory or gustatory. (See 6, page 

 449; c, page 531; (/, i)age 009; I, page 1.) 



(3) When an ant goes out from her dwelling, she lays down from 

 her feet an odorous substance whereby she is guided on her return 

 journey. She discerns her own scent through the antepenultimate 

 segment of the antenna, and through the air. When this tenth 

 segment is eliminated she is no longer able to retrace her steps and 

 is completely bewildered. She is as incapal)le as is a dog in pursuit 

 of a master who has waded. (See r, page 522.) lint in her case 

 the track remains, whilf power to pick up the scent has been de- 

 stroyed in the [)ursuer. 



(4) The next two segments of the funicle, the eighth and ninth 

 counted from the proximal end of the; antenna of Strndiiinid fiilvinn 

 piceum, discern the odor of the (jueen and of the undeveloped young 

 (ordinarily her progeny. When these segments are eliinin:ite<l. the 

 worker ant, that in her normal condition evinced extreme devotion 

 to tlie welfare of the inactive young and to tlu^ (ju«*en-mother, becomes 

 wholly iinlifferent to all or any of those whom she has heretofore 

 served. There are indications that thi' iua<'tive young, as well as 

 the (pieen, have a progressivj- odor, appreciable to the workers both 

 by contact and in the air, and that the odor is a distinctive one, 

 alluring to the worker^. (See c, page 542; /.-, page 229. i 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [.Jan., 



(5) The next two segments, the sixth and seventh from the proxi- 

 mal enil of the antenna, discern the odor of ants of alien species, 

 always regarded and treated as enemies unless acquaintance has 

 been nnnle in the earliest days of the indivitlual ant's existence. 

 Prolonged warfare and terrible slaughter often occur between ant 

 colonies of different species. But if the sixth and seventh segments 

 of the antennie be eliminated, ants of different species or even of 

 different sub-families will live together amicably and will regurgitate 

 food to one another. I have had representatives of so many as 

 five different genera living in close fellowship in the same nest. 

 The specific odor is discerned by contact, the antenna being applied 

 to some part of the body of the ant encountered. (See h, page 321; 

 k, page 229.) 



The two antennse of the ant are identical in function, either one 

 serving the purposes of both. Among the three or four thousand 

 species of known ants the number of segments in the antennie varies 

 from four to thirteen. In my work of ascertaining the function of 

 the antennal segments, I used mainly Stennmnia fidoum piceum, a 

 Myrmicine ant, having twelve segments in the antennae. It is not 

 improbable that further investigation, equally painstaking, would 

 reveal olfactory function^? in other segments than those tested by 

 me. It is certain, however, that segments proximal to the sixth 

 do not discern the odors appreciated by the seven at the distal end. 



Since the ants have given evidence that they bear in their bodies 

 several different odors, they must have glands producing unlike 

 odors. The nest aura requires no separate apparatus, because its 

 creation is effected by the combined odors of the inhabitants of the 

 nest. The colony odor, inherited from the queen and changing with 

 age of the ants, demands a means of production that might well be 

 inquired for along the sides of the thorax where the ants so commonly 

 apply a caressing antenna. The scent that is laid down on the 

 track would probably issue from the feet or legs, while the odor of 

 the queen would be produced in some gland that would be no more 

 than rudimentary in the workers. The diverse specific odors are 

 easily discernible by human nostrils; and even an ant may be tem- 

 porarily deceived by an individual of the enemy's troop painted 

 with the blood of a friend. There must be glands for proilucing 

 this odor. 



Many observers have described certain vesicles in the integument 

 of ants, as well as of many other insects, since Hicks first studied 

 them. (1857 to 1860.) Janet, whose work on the anatomy of the 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



ant has been long continued, highly skilled and very prolific, shows 

 these organs as a pit communicating with the external air by means 

 of a pore. They have been variously named. I suggest to myrme- 

 cologists the possibility that these vesicles found in groups or scattered 

 over the body and limbs of the ant may be the producers of the 

 odors borne by the insect, and I urge research among Forel's " inverted 

 flasks," the ''pits and pegs,"' the "plates and pores," and all 

 papillae on the ant. 



Dr. X. E. Mclndoo, of the Bureau of Entomolog\' at Washington, 

 D. C, has issued two papers, one in April, 1914, The Olfactory Sense 

 of the Honey Bee, and one in November, 1914, The Olfactory Sense of 

 Insects. I venture a few brief comments thereupon. 



Dr. Mclndoo quotes Dr. W. M. Wheeler's objection to my dis- 

 covery that "the olfactory organs of an animal may exhibit 'regional 

 differentiations.'" This objection, unsupported as it is by physio- 

 logical tests applied to the ant, should influence no investigator. 

 If there be error in the process of experimentation or flaw in the logic 

 of the deduction, the critic should indicate the point of departure 

 from a correct course. It is true that my statements are " unsup- 

 ported by other observers," but lack of support by other observers 

 is a misfortune that necessarily befalls the research worker who 

 makes the earliest observation. 



Dr. Mclndoo's iterated statement that his bees were "al)normal," 

 without definite indication of the cau.se or kind of abnormality, 

 gives no assistance in the formation of a sound judgment concerning 

 the changes due to mutilation. "Abnormality" of some sort i>^ a 

 natural consequent of mutilation. The question is whether a 

 certain al)n()rmal condition invariably ensues from a particuhir 

 mutilation. 



In tho.se ca.ses where Dr. Mclndoo's surgical operations upon 

 his bees were performed by the pulling apart or the i)urning olY of 

 segments, the lesions produced in the atljacent tissues nmst have 

 been such as to seriously affect the functions of the parts subject 

 to subs<'(juent observation. 



The odors of the essential oils used in his experiments must have 

 been diffused through the air, and the reaction of the bees, normal 

 or altnonnal. may in many cases have been due to the effect of the 

 odorous particles upon the trachea through the s|)iracles rather fh.m 

 to their appeal to the sen.sc of smell. 



Dr. Mclndoo's exp<'riments and observations appear to me to Ix 

 confinnatory rather than contradictory of the view of most eiit(»- 




40 lM{0(KKl)lNi;s OK THK ACADKMY OF [.lail.. 



mologists that tho antcniuo arc the organs of smell in insects. The 

 evidence he sets forth is far from hoing convincing of the truth of 

 his final asseveration that "the antenmr can no longer be regarded 

 as the seat of the sense of smell in insects"; and equally remote from 

 acceptance should be his conclusion that the organs he chooses to 

 call "olfactory jiores" "are the true olfactory apparatus in 

 Hymenoptera."

 The President, Samuel G. Dixon, ]M.D., LL.D., in the Chair. 



< )no hundred persons present. 



The deaths of George J. Scattergood, July 10, 1914, and of 

 Benjamin Sharp. M.D., January 23, 1915, members, were announced. 



Gn the announcement of the death of Dr. Sharp, the following 

 was read by the Recording Secretary and ordered to be placed on 

 the minutes: 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia desires 

 to place on record its sense of the loss sustained by the society and 

 by the scientific world in the death of Dr. Benjamin Sharp, on 

 January 23. 



Dr. Sharj) graduated in mecUcine from the University of Pennsyl- 

 vania in 1879. He subsequently studied in the Universities of 

 Berlin, Leipzig, and Wurzburg. Immediately after .securing his degree 

 of Doctor of Phil(js()j)hy from the last named institution in 1883 he 

 published his first paper in the Proceedings of the Academy, a reprint 

 of his graduation thesis on the anatomy of Ancyhis. He subse- 

 (piently pul)Hshed twenty communications as contributions to the 

 PR()<EEDiN(is. They cover a wide range of subjects, but are most 

 imj)ortant, perhaps, as studies of the visual organs of moUusks. 



I)r. Sharp was elected Corresponding Secretary of the .\cademy 

 in 1890 and served efficiently until 1902. 



His work as an attache of the I'nited States Fish Conunission, 

 as zoologist of the first Peary .\rctic Ex])edition, and as professor 

 in the .Academy, the University of Pennsylvania, and in the Central 

 High School, together with his explorations oi Behring Sea. the West 

 Indies, and the Sandwich Islands, was all jiroseciitecl in direct asso- 

 ciation with the Academy, to which he was always mo.st generous 

 in the expression of his obligation for encouragement and assistance. 



Dr. Sharp was endowed with a retentive memory and the faculty 

 of clear ancl accurate statement. He was a man of singular jx-rsonal 

 charm and of an unusual range of sympathy and accomplishment. 

 A strikingly attractive figure anywhere, he was ('(jually at home in

Mh. Hoheht C'rsHMAX MrruMiY spoke on bird-life at an outpost 

 of the Antarctic. The connnunication was beautifully illu.strated 

 by lantern views. 



The Secretary' read the following connnunication from Miss 

 Adele M. Fielde, of Seattle, Washington: 



Concerning the Sense of Smell in Dogs. — In the winter of 1911 12, 

 I spent over four consecutive months in the city of Tucson, Arizona, 

 lodging in one house and taking my meals in another, a quarter of 

 a mile distant. The street, In the residential section of the city, 

 traversefl by me several times daily, was wide, with paved walk on 

 both sides, in front of detached houses whose owners generally 

 cherished watch dogs. In my earliest journeys along the sidewalks, 

 the dogs, of various breeds, in their respective, shrubby dooryards, 

 all barked at me, so intentionally as to make me doubt whether 

 existence would be tolerable under such local conditions. 



I persisted, however, in my course as a. pedestrian, made no 

 acquaintance with the owTiers of the dogs, no calls at their residences, 

 and no efforts at conciliation of the animals. Nevertheless, the 

 barking of the dogs gradually subsided and then ceased, first on the 

 west side of the street that I traversed most frequ(uitly, and later 

 upon the east side of the street, where I walked but seldom. Some 

 weeks before I left Tucson, all the dogs had stopped barking at me 

 during my passage alongside their grounds, whether by day or by 

 night. In the evenings I usually carried a lantern whose light fell 

 upon the pavement without illuminating me. 



A small dog, resident in the house where I lodged, maintained 

 hostilities toward me for several days after my arrival, but changed 

 his mental attitude toward me with no conciliation on my part, and 

 then habitually gave immoderate expression to his delight whenever 

 I returned to the house. 



Such change in the behavior of these dogs indicates that at my 

 earliest coming they perceived an unknown scent either upon the 

 pavement or in the air and resented its intrusion among countless 

 familiar odors. When accustomed to the intruded scent, having 

 received no injury from its bearer, they ceased from audible protest 

 against her presence. Without contact at any time, and with 

 darkness and distance often such as to make vision improbable, the 

 cause of the behavior of the dogs appears to lie in their sense of 

 smell. That they could pick up the scent laid down on the pave- 

 ment was to be expected of them. That they recognized its depositor 

 in the dark and at a distance of many yards, and refrained from 

 any vocal exercise save a monosyllabic assertion of being on duty, 

 indicates high olfactory sensitivity. 



Joseph C. Guernsey, M.D., was elected a member.

I.NTHODICTION. 



Tlie present .study wu.s undertaken at the suK^estion of Pnjf. < into, 

 of the Imperial I'niversity of Tokyo; and to him my hearty thanks 

 are (hie for supervision and the revision of part of the manuscript. 



My first purpo.^e was merely to identify and name specie-. Hul 




44 PROCEEDINC.S OF THK ACADKMY OK (Feb., 



I soon found that tlio classifications of the Ophiuroidca liithorto j)ro- 

 posed were very unsatisfactory. Indeed, their imperfectness became 

 a haunt to mc; so I determined to devise a new classification of 

 my own. 



For this purpo.se, I have di.s.sected representatives of as many 

 genera as were accessible; and the following are some of the more 

 important results obtained: 



A. Morphological. — Those forms that have arms, capable of 

 being vertically coiled, have a very compact oral skeleton (the 

 adoral shields are entirely proximal to the oral shield, being firmly 

 unitetl to it; the oral frames are very stout, those of the same radius 

 l)eing firmly joined together; the peristomal plates are entire and 

 more or less .soldered to the oral frames, etc.), and very short, stout 

 vertebriP, of which the articulation is streptospondyline, with a 

 very rudimentary, or no articular peg. More or less divided ver- 

 tebnr are found only in certain genera with horizontally flexi})le 

 arms; such vertebrie are of two kinds, those which are divided into 

 halves by a single fusiform pore (found in. forms in which the dorsal 

 side of the arms is more or less unprotected) and those in which the 

 two halves are separated by a series of .small pores (found in forms 

 with the dorsal side of the arms entirely protected). Forms with 

 quadrangular and .stout teeth have oral frames with well-developed 

 lateral wings for the attachment of voluminous masticatory mus- 

 cles, etc. 



B. Systematic. — Astroceras, Trichaster and Euryala have a certain 

 common structure, by which they may be distinguished from either 

 Asteronyx or Asteroschema; Astrotoma and its allies have certain 

 distinctive characters in contrast to Asto'oporpa, A.strochele, Gor- 

 gonocephalus, Astrocladus and their allies; the Amphiuridae (emend.) 

 and the Ophiotrichidae are intimately related by their internal struc- 

 ture; "Ophiactis'^ pars, i.e., my Ampkiactis, is a connecting link 

 between the Ophiacanthidse and Amphiuridae; the Ophiolcpidida3, 

 Ophiodermatidaj and Ophiocomida; form together another compact 

 group; my Ophiochitonida are not referable to Amphiuridae (emend.) 

 but are very near the Ophiodermatida; and Ophiocomidu); Ophiopsila 

 is, as a matter of fact, a near allj'^ of the Ophiocomidae; ^^Ophioconis" 

 pars, i.e., my Ophiuroconis and Ophiurodon, and "Ophiochceta" 

 pars, i.e., my OphiurochcEta, are perfectly distinguishable from 

 Ophiolimna (emend.), by their internal .structure, etc. 



Prefixing so much, I now proceed to the exposition of my views, 

 leaving them to be judged on their merits. 




1915.] NATIKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 4.> 



During the present study, I have received great help from Dr. 

 Hubert Lyman Clark, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, in 

 the loan of many precisely determined specimens from that Museum 

 and in helpful advice; my best thanks are due to him. This paper 

 is in fact an outcome of his suggestions. A more detailed monograph 

 with illustrations will be published ultimately in Japan. 



The outbreak of the present war has made it impossible for iiu' to 

 receive some specimens of Palaeozoic ophiurans promised me by 

 Dr. B. Stiirtz, so that I am obliged to defer a revisicm and classifica- 

 tion of Palieozoic ophiurans to the future. 



The greater part of the pre.sent study was done in the Zoological 

 Institute of the Imperial University of Tokyo, and the type speci- 

 mens of all the new species described belong to it. 



Sendai, Japan, December 1, 1914. 



Subclass I. CEGOPHIUROIDA nov. 



Opliiuroidea with external ambulacral grooves, and without 

 ventral arm plates. Radial shields, genital plates and scales, oral 

 shields and dorsal arm plates also absent. Ambulacral plates 

 alternate or opposite; in the latter case, they may often be soldered 

 in pairs to form the vertebra;. Atlambulacral plates, i.e., lateral 

 arm plates, subventral. Madreporite either dorsal or ventral, 

 often large and similar in shape to that of an Asteroid. 



This subclass consi.sts chieHy of Palaeozoic genera. 



The (Kgophiuroida lack all the fundamental characters by which 

 Recent ophiurans are clearly distinguished from Asteroids. Indeed, 

 the distinction of the present subclass from the cryptozonial Aster- 

 oids depends merely upon the ditTerent development of certain 

 common structures. 



Subclass II. MYOPHIUROIDA nov. 



Opliiuroidea without ••.xternal ami)ulaeral grooves, and with 

 ventral arm plates. Radial shields, genital plates and .seales, oral 

 shields and dorsal arm i)lat«'s usually present; but sometimes rudi- 

 mentary or absent. .Vtnbulacral plates opposite, usually completely 

 soldered in pairs to form the vertebra.'. Madreporite represented 

 by one, or .sometimes all, of the oral shields. 



This subclass includes certain Palaeozoic fornn ;md :ili t lie opliiurans 

 since the Mesozoic.

Key to subfamilies of Ophiomyxidce. 



A — Oral shields separated from first lateral arm plates by outer 

 lobes of the adoral shields; peristomal plates usually double 

 or triple, not very thick, not firmly fixed to the oral frames, 

 which are rather slender; vertebrae long and slender, except 

 one or t^yo basal ones which are discoidal, distal ones usually 

 divided into halves; wings of vertebra? not equally thick,

entire, very thick, fused with oral frames, which are very 

 stout; vertebriv rather short and very stout, many proximal 

 ones discoidal, none divided into halves; wings of vertebriB 

 almost equally thick laterally and dorsally; vertebral articu-

 or absent Ophiobyrsix.e. 



Subfamily 1. OPHIOMYXIX.E Ljungman, 1871 (emend.). 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiohelus, Ophiosciasma, Ophiogeron, 

 Astrogeron, Ophiocynodus, Ophiostyracium, Ophiosyzygus, Ophio- 

 leptoplax, Ophioscolex, Xeoplax, Ophiomora, Ophiomyxa, Ophiodera, 

 Ophiohymen, and provisionally Ophiambix, besides two new genera, 

 Ophiostiba and Ophiohyahis. 



OPHIOSTIBA gen. nov. 



Disk covered by a skin containing a number of scatteretl granules. 

 Radial shields very rudimentary, forming a continuous row with 

 the marginal disk scales, which are well developed, as in Ophiomyxa, 

 Ophiomora and Xeoplax. Teeth and oral papillae present, with acute 

 ends. Arms skin-covered; dorsal arm plates absent, while the 

 lateral arm plates are subventral, so that the dorsal side of the arms 

 is largely naked. Distal verteV)rffl more or less divided into halves 

 by a longitudinally fusiform pore. Arm spines few, all converted 

 into compound hooks. Tentacle scales absent. 



This new genus differs from Ophioscolex chiefly in the presence of 

 the marginal disk scales and in the conversion of the arm spines 

 into compound hooks; anrl from Xco])lax in the fewer arm spines, 

 which are converted into compound hooks, and in the absence of 

 tentacle scales. 



Ophio8tiba hidekii' sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 3.5 mm. Length of arms IG mm. Width of 

 arms at base 0.8 mm. Disk hexagonal, with concave interradial 

 borders, covered by a .soft skin, which contains a numl)er of scattered 

 granules. Radial shields very rudimentary and insignificant, 

 forming a continuous row with the marginal disk scales, which are 

 well devcloi)ed. CJenital slits very small and short. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, with perfectly rounded outer and lateral 

 angles, convex, slightly longer than wide; each serving as a inadre-

porite. Adoral shiolds lonj!; anil narrow, hut with wickMicd outer 

 ends, luci'tinj; oat'h otlier within. Four or five oral papilla' on 

 either side, triangular, with acute apices. Teeth stout, trianjj;ular, 

 acute. 



Six arms, of which three are longer tiian the other three, as an 

 indication of schizogony. Dorsal arm plates entirely ab.sent; dorsal 

 side of vertehriB clearly vi.sihle. Lateral arm jilates low. meeting 

 below. First ventral arm plates very small, rhomhoidal, longer 

 than wide; the following heptagonal, with strongly concave j^roximo- 

 lateral and outer sides (the former adjoining the tentacle pores), 

 much longer than wide, widest opposite the outer ends of the tentacle 

 pores; calcification very feeble along median line, the plates apjiear- 

 ing as if longitudinally grooved. In the outer half of the arm, the 

 vertebnie are more or less divided into halves by fusiform pores. 

 Two or three hyaline arm spines, converted into compound hooks, 

 with four or five denticles along the abradial side; the lowest one is 

 shghtly shorter than the upper ones, wdiich are about two-thirds as 

 long as the corresponding arm joint. The uppermost spines of 

 either side of successive arm joints are connected by a hyaline, 

 web-like membrane, except on the basal and most distal joints. 

 Tentacle pores large, without any scale. Color in alcohol: disk 

 deep chocolate-brown, except the granules, which are white; arms 

 broA\Tiish j-ellow. 



Two specimens; Sagami Sea; 300 fathoms. 



This new species evidently reproduces by schizogony, as indicated 

 by the hetaractiny and the occurrence of six madn^porites. 



OPHIOHYALUS gen. nov. 



Disk covered by a skin, with marginal scales. Radial shields 

 very rudimentary, forming a continuous row with the marginal 

 disk .scales. Teeth and oral papilla flattened and serrate, like 

 those of Ophiomyxa, Ophiodera and Ophiohymen. Dorsal arm p\sites 

 present, but rudimentary, entire, thin, hyaline, separated from each 

 other by naked spaces. Vertebrae more or less divided into halves. 

 Arm .spines few, converted into compound hooks. Tentacle scales 

 absent. 



This new genus is near Ophiomyxa, but differs from it in the rudi- 

 mentarv- radial shields, the divided vertebrae, the entire rudimentary 

 dorsal arm plates and the conversion of the arm spines into com- 

 pound hooks. In almost all characters, Ophiohyalus is more embry- 

 onal than Ophiornyxa. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 49 



OphiohyaluB gotoi sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 9 mm. Length of arms 28 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1 mm. Disk pentagonal, with concave interradial 

 borders, very fiat, covered by a thin skin. jMarginal disk scales 

 present, feeble. Radial shields rudimentary and insignificant, 

 forming a continuous row with the marginal disk scales. Genital 

 slits small and short, extending from outer end of adoral shield to 

 that of second lateral arm plate. 



Oral shields triangular, with perfectly rounded lateral angles, 

 outer side slightly concave; two .ind a half times as wide as long. 

 Adoral shields large, triangular, very long, acutely tapered inwards, 

 but not meeting. Oral plates long and narrow. The space encircled 

 by the oral and adoral shields and oral plates is strongly depressed. 

 Three or four oral papilla? on cither side, thin, hyaline, serrate along 

 the free edge. Two or three short, wide, flattened teeth, with 

 rounded and finely serrate ends. Deep in the oral slit on either side 

 of each jaw there occurs one conical, rough papilla, which protects 

 the first oral tentacle pore. 



Arms slender, covered by a very thin, transparent skin. Dorsal 



arm plates small, oval, thin, hyaline, longer than wide, wider within 



than without, separated from each other by naked spaces; they lie 



over the distal parts of the vertebrae of the corresponding arm joints, 



and become very small and delicate towards the extremity of the 



arm. Lateral arm plates low, slightly flaring, successive plates not 



in contact with each other, but separated by a naked space, which 



is widened upwards and continued into a large naked space Ijounded 



by the dorsal and lateral arm plates and the vertebra. First ventral 



arm plate not ver>' small, quadrangular, with strongly curved outer 



side, much wider without than within; those Ix'vond nearly rhoin- 



boidal in outline, with a conspicuous reentrant notch at outer end 



and a half pore for the tentacle at each lateral angle; much longer 



than wide, widest opposite outer ends of tentacle pores; successive 



plates not in contact with each other, except within the disk. The 



lateral arm plates do not, however, meet each other in the ventral 



median line, so that there is left here a naked, depressed space, which 



is especially well-marked near the extremity of the arm. Except 



within the disk and at the very l)a.se of arms, the vertel)rip are more 



or less or entirely divided into halves by fusiform pores, which 



become larger and longer in the more distal jiart of the arm. .\nn 



spines two, subventral, unequal, gla.ssy, all converted into compound 



hooks, with a series of booklets along their ventral side, covered by

a thin, transparent skin; the lower one is much larger and longer 

 than the upper. On some basal arm joints there occurs on the 

 lateral arm j^late one more spine, which is placed on the dorsal 

 margin of the plate and also bears a series of booklets on one side; it 

 is larger and longer than the other two and nearly as long as the 

 corresponding arm joint. No tentacle scale. Color in alcohol: 

 yellowish white. 



Two specimens; probably Sagami Sea. 



Subfamily 2. OPHIOBYRSINiE nov. 



(Characters as given in key, p. 46.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiobyrsa, Ophiobyr sella, Ophiophrixus, 

 Ophiobrachion and provisionally Ophioschiza, besides a new genus, 

 Ophiosmilax. 



The Ophiobyrsinse rather approach the next two families in 

 skeletal characters. 



OPHIOSMILAX gen. nov. 



Disk and arms covered by a thick skin. Radial shields very 

 rudimentary and insignificant. Single oral papilla on either side 

 and two or three dental papillae at the apex of each jaw. Teeth in 

 a single vertical series. Teeth and papillae all alike, stout, stumpy, 

 conspicuously thorny at tips. Second oral tentacle pores open 

 outside oral slits, each provided with a thorny, stumpy papilla, 

 which arises from adoral shield. Dorsal arm plates absent, while 

 the lateral arm plates are subventral, so that the dorsal side of the 

 arms is merely covered by a naked skin. Ventral arm plates well- 

 developed, in contact with each other. Vertebrae short and very 

 stout. \'ertebral articulation streptospondyline, the articular peg 

 being entirely absent. Arm spines few, converted into compound 

 hooks. No tentacle scale. 



This new genus more or less resembles Ophiophrixus in the total 

 absence of dorsal arm plates, but differs from it in the rudimentary 

 radial shields, in the peculiarities of teeth and papillae and in the 

 conversion of arm spines into compound hooks. The last character 

 reminds us of Ophiobrachion, but Ophiosmilax has no disk spines, 

 while it does have peculiar teeth and papillae and fewer and longer 

 arm spines. 



Ophiosmilax mirabilis sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 2 mm. Length of arms 12 mm. Width of arms 

 0.8 mm. Disk pentagonal, with concave interbrachial borders, 

 covered by a thick skin, which contains very fine, thin, transparent 




1915.] NATUIL\L SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



scales. Radial shields rudimentary and insignificant, lying on the 

 disk margin. Genital slits very small and short. 



Oral shields triangular, with convex outer border. Adoral shields 

 large, quadrangular, meeting within. Oral slits short, fairly closed 

 up. Single oral papilla on either side, short, stumpy, conspicuously 

 thorny at tip, turned up ventrally, instead of projecting towards 

 oral slit. Two or three dental papillae at apex of each jaw, similar 

 in shape and in size to oral papilla, also turned up ventrally. Teeth 

 in a single vertical series, stout, stumpy, thorny at tips. Second 

 oral tentacle pores open outside oral slits, each provided with a 

 stumpy and thorny papilla, which arises from adoral shield. 



Arms stout in comparison with the small disk, covered by a thick, 

 naked skin. Dorsal arm plates absent. Lateral arm plates sub- 

 ventral, .strongly flaring. First ventral arm plate large, quadran- 

 gular, with rounded angles, slightly longer than wide, much wider 

 without than within; those beyond also large, hexagonal; proximal 

 and proximo-lateral sides very short; distal and disto-lateral sides 

 long; outer angles perfectly rounded; as long as, or slightly longer 

 than, wide, feebly calcified and transparent, except the outer and 

 lateral margins, where the calcification is complete and opaque. 

 Vertebrae short and very stout, with streptospondyline articulation, 

 the articular shoulder and umbo being very stout, while the articular 

 peg is entirely' absent. Arm spines two or three, lying flat on the arm, 

 all converted into compound hooks, hyaline; the uppermost two are 

 subequal, about two-thirds as long as corresponding arm joint, while 

 the lowest one is about half as long as the same. The smaller spines 

 have two or three booklets, which lie in one plane, while the larger 

 ones have six or seven booklets, which lie in two divergent planes. 

 Tentacle pores small, without scales. Color in alcohol: brownish 

 yellow.

1911, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 23, p. 617 (in Japanese). 



This species strongly resembles A. rubrum Lyman, but differs 

 chiefly in the much coarser granules of the arm bases, in having 

 tentacle tubes for some ten basal tentacles, and in the relatively 

 longer and stouter arm spines. Three or four granules lie in 1 mm. 

 on the dorsal side of the free arm base. Oral tentacle pores, as 

 well as tentacle pores of some ten basal arm joints, open by means 

 of cuticular tubes, each of which, except that of the oral tentacle 

 and the first arm tentacle, is attached to the adradial arm spine on 

 its adradial side. The arm spines become longer and .stouter distally,

till the adradial one is distinctly clavate and is about twice as long 

 as the corresponding arm joint. The color is light pinkish brown 

 in alcohol. The type specimen is 16 mm. in disk diameter, 230 mm. 

 in arm length and 4.5 mm. in arm width at base.

Asteroschema glaaoum Matsumoto. 



1911, Dobuts. Z. Tokyo, 23, p. 617 (in Japanese). 



This species is near .4.. salix Ljnnan, but differs from it in coarser 

 granules on disk and arm bases, in stouter arm bases, in much shorter 

 arm spines, and in oral tentacles being enclosed in tubes. About 

 six granules lie in 1 mm. on the radial ribs and free arm bases. Arms 

 very stout at base, as high as wide. Arm spines longer and stouter 

 outwards, till the adradial one is somewhat clavate and is slightly 

 longer than the corresponding arm joint. Oral tentacles enclosed in 

 tubes. First two or three tentacle pores also provided with tubes, 

 though rudimentary. The color is pale gray in alcohol. The type 

 specimen is 11 mm. in disk diameter, 100 mm. in arm length and 

 4 mm. in arm width at base.

Diameter of disk 10 mm. Length of arms 120 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 3 mm. Disk rather flat, divided into ten lobes, cor- 

 responding to the radial ribs, by ten radiating furrows; covered by 

 a skin, which contains very fine, smooth, close-set granules. Ventral 

 interljrachial areas rather vertical, narrow, forming a deep notch, 

 on the floor of which opens one madreporic pore. Genital slits 

 rather short, more or less divergent dorsally. Ventral surface of 

 disk covered by a finely and rather sparsely granulated skin. 



Oral angles not markedly set off from the outer parts. Six or 

 seven teeth arranged in a single vertical row, triangular, very stout. 

 On either side of the oral angles, there are several coarse, flat, smooth, 

 pavement-like grains, which correspond to oral papilla?. 



Arms very stout for the first three or four free joints, but becoming 

 rather slender further out; their width just outside the fourth free 

 joint is 2.5 mm. They constantly taper outwards, so that they are 

 exceedingly slender towards the extremities, which are very acute. 

 Dorsal and lateral surface of the arms covered by a skin, which is 

 similar to that of the disk, containing very fine, smooth, close-set

granules, of which there are about five in 1 mm. on the dorsal surface 

 of the arm bases. The granules become much finer outwards, and 

 almost disappear near extremity of arm. Vertebnc visible through 

 skin, but surface of arm practically smooth and without distinct 

 demarcation of joints, except of first three or four, which are marked 

 of! l\v shallow constrictions. \'entral surface of arms entirely 

 naked, and lateral and ventral arm plates clearly visible through 

 skin. First tentacle pore unprotected; next four or five pores 

 provided with a single arm spine, and the rest with two. Abradial 

 spine ver>' small, cylindrical, enclosed in skin, more or less rough 

 at free end. Adradial one clavate, enclosed in skin, very rough at 

 free end. Arm spines largest at middle of arm, the adradial one 

 being one and a half times as long as, and the abradial one a little 

 shorter than, the corresponding arm joint. They are transformed 

 into compound hooks, with three to six booklets, towards the very 

 extremity of the arm. Oral tentacle pore and first three or four 

 tentacle pores provided with tubes. Color in alcohol: grayish brown.

Diameter of disk 4.5 mm. Length of arms 50 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 2.5 mm. Disk five-lobed, with deeply indented inter- 

 brachial borders, with lobes emarginate towards arms, flat, sunken 

 at the central region, raised at the lobes, covered with very fine, 

 smooth, irregular scales, which are very close-set and partly imbri- 

 cated. Radial shields naked, very small, triangular, with apex 

 turned within, tuberculous when examined under a microscope. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas with very deep notches, exceedingly 

 narrowed by the very wide arm bases. Two genital slits small, 

 parallel, nearly vertical. On either .side of each lobe of the disk, 

 lies the naked genital plate, which is large, oval, and tuberculous 

 under a microscope. 



Oral angles puffed laterally, almost filling up the oral slits. Teeth 

 small, triangular, arranged in a single vertical row. No oral or 

 dental papilla?. 



Arms very wide at base, keeping the same width for a distance of 

 about 4 or 5 mm., then rather rapidly narrowed, becoming slender 

 and cylindrical, with a width of about 1 mm.; covered with fine

scales similar to those of the disk. Arm joints invisible in the 

 proximal part of the arm, but more or less distinct distally. First 

 tentacle pore free of arm spines; those beyond provided with a single 

 spine, which is very small, short, peg-like, somewhat flattened, 

 rough at the end as seen under a microscope, lying flat on the ventral 

 surface of the arm. Half way out on the arm, each tentacle pore 

 is provided with two spines, of which the second, or abradial one, 

 is exceedingly small and rather inconspicuous; the adradial one 

 then becomes a little longer and erect to the arm. Color in alcohol : 

 white or pale yellow. 



Numerous specimens; Sagami Sea. 



In smaller specimens, the arms are scarcely widened at the base, 

 which is also the case in regenerating ones; for schizogony takes 

 place in this species as in the genotype, A. virgo Koehler. Most 

 specimens are five-armed, but the arms are often unequal, two or 

 three being larger than the others. I have, however, one specimen 

 with six arms, three larger and three smaller. In four-armed speci- 

 mens, two or three arms may be larger and the other two or one 

 smaller. Still another specimen has only three arms, doubtless 

 indicating that it has lately undergone division, and that the lost 

 parts have not been regenerated.

Diameter of disk, 22 mm. Distance from centre of disk to inter- 

 radial margin, 8.5 mm. Distance from outer end of oral slit to first 

 bifurcation of arm, 11 mm. Arms branched nineteen or twenty 

 times, measuring about 125 mm. in total length. Width of ventral 

 side of arm base within disk, 4.5 mm. Disk five-lo])ed, with concave 

 interbrachial borders, covered by a thick skin, which is apparently 

 smooth, but contains fine, close-set granules of microscopic size. 

 On the radial ribs these granules are flattened, pavement-like and 

 coarser, being even visible to the naked eye. Several smooth, 

 hemispherical tubercles are scattered on the disk. Radial ribs 

 gently rai.sed, forming rounded ridges, with rather indistinct out- 

 lines, not quite reaching to the disk centre; their back is marked 

 with concentrically arranged swellings, corresponding to the imbri- 

 cating, .soldered plates, of which the radial shield is composed. The 

 ventral surface of the disk appears smooth to the naked eye. Genital 

 slits not very large.

This species can be easily distinguished from other species of 

 Astrocladus by the entirely smooth disk covering and by the arms, 

 which are distinctly annulated with hook-bearing segments even 

 at the very base. 



Astroboa arctos sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk, 65 mm. Distance from centre of disk to inter- 

 radial margin, 25 mm. Distance from outer end of oral slit to first 

 •bifurcation, 32 mm. Arms branched about thirty-seven times, 

 measuring approximately 420 mm. in total length. Width of 

 ventral surface of arm base within disk, 17 mm. 



Disk decagonal, with concave interbrachial and brachial borders, 

 the former being longer and more concave than the latter; verj' high 

 and convex, but with more or less depressed central region, covered 

 by a thick skin, which is shagreened by the presence of very fine, 

 close-set granules. The granules are smooth, not acute, irregular 

 in size, when viewed under a micro-scope, the coarser ones being 

 more numerous on the radial ribs than in the intercostal spaces. 

 Radial ribs long, narrow, bar-like, widest at outer end, suddenly 

 narrowed for a very short distance, then uniformly tapered inwards, 

 •nearly reaching disk-centre. Ventral interbrachial areas coveretl 

 by thick, apparently smooth skin, which, however, contains fine 

 microscopical granules. Genital slits rather large, adradial border 

 prf)t('Cte(l by a cluster of dose-set spinules. 



Madreporic shield, situated at inner angle of a ventral inter- 

 brachial area, more or less semilunar, with semicircular inner, and 

 dii^tinctly notclied outer, side and roundetl lateral angles, .\reas 

 proximal to ventral interbrachial regions, apparently smooth, but 

 •closely covered with very fine granules of micro.scopic size, the 

 granules being ratiicr coarse and distinct at the oral angles. Teeth 

 and papilla' very numerous; oral and dental i)a{)illa'. rather small, 

 spiniforni, and not very acute; teeth, much larger and longer than 

 papilla', distinctly spatiilated, and flattened at tip.

equally developed, but one is longer, stouter and more branched 

 than the other. Dorsal and lateral surface of arms covered by a 

 thick skin, uliich is very finely and closely granulated; granules, 

 irregular in size and roughly distinguished as of two kinds; finer 

 ones entirely covered by skin, flat, irregularly iioiygonal, forming 

 together a sort of mosaic; coarser ones, coarser than any granules 

 of disk, hemispherical, tubercle-like, and uniformly scattered. 

 Ventral surface of arms aj^parently smooth, but covered by a mosaic 

 of flat antl irregularly polygonal granules of microscopic size. F'ir.st 

 pair of tentacle pores distinct, opening in slight depressions; second 

 often distinct; following three or four pairs entirely invisible; those 

 beyond are again distinct. Arm spines absent on proximal joints, 

 but occur from fourth or fifth bifurcation outwards. They are 

 exceedingly minute and granule-like, two to four of them occurring 

 at each tentacle pore. The double rows of hook-bearing granules 

 are present only on very fine twigs, the main stems within four- 

 teenth or fifteenth bifurcation being free from them. The shaft 

 between the first and second bifurcations usually consists of four 

 arm joints; the outer shafts consist of six to eight, usually seven 

 joints. Color in alcohol, as well as when dry: dark grayish brown 

 above, and dark yellowish l)rown below. 



Two specimens; off Alisaki Marine Biological Station; 5-10 

 fathoms. Four specimens; Sagami Sea. 



Among the five known species of Astrohoa, A. clavata (Lj'man) is 

 distinguished from the others by the spiny granules of the disk and 

 arms, and A. glohifera (Doderlein) by the position of the madreporic 

 shield. A. nuda (Lyman) and A. nigra Doderlein have di.stinct 

 annulations of hook-bearing granules on the arms throughout, while 

 A. ern(B Doderlein has no such annulations on the greater proximal 

 part of the arms. So that the present species is near A. ernce, but 

 differs from it in the much finer and less distinct granules of the disk 

 and arms, and in the less numerous arm joints composing a shaft. 

 In the last character, A. nrdos rather resembles A. nigra from 

 Zanzibar and from Hirado Strait. 



This species is common in the shallow waters around Misaki, 

 occurring together with Astrodadus coniferus, especially var. dofleini 

 [A. dofleini Doderlein is, in my opinion, conspecific with A. coniferus 

 f Doderlein), being, however, a variety of the latter]. According to 

 present knowledge, Astrohoa is represented in the Sagami Sea by 

 A. glohifera and the present species, in deep and shallow water 

 respectively.

Subfamily 2. ASTROTOMIN^ nov. 



(Characters as given in keys, p. 55.) 



This subfamily includes Astrothrombus, Astrothorax, Astrotoma 

 and Astroclon, besides a new genus, Astrothamnus. 



AstrothamnuB gen. nov. 



Disk divided into ten radiating lobes by radial and interradial 

 furrows, closely covered with coarse granules or stumpy tubercles, 

 which are acute or thorny at tips. Ventral interradial areas strongly 

 concave, with large, long, more or less parallel genital slits. Teeth 

 and dental papillae similar, spiniform, forming a cluster at the apex 

 of each jaw. Oral papillae absent, so that the sides of the oral slits 

 are naked. Arms simple, distinctly annulated by zones of densely 

 set, minute, compound hooks; the interannuli are covered with 

 coarse granules, which are arranged more or less clearly in two 

 series. Arm .spines 3-5, peg-like, usually rough at tips, serving as 

 tentacle scales. 



This genus includes Koehlcr's Af^troloma bellator, A. vecors and .4. 

 rigens, besides the genotype, Astrothamnus echiiiaceus sp. nov. 



Astrothamnus is distinguished from genuine Astrotoma as follows: 



A — Disk covered with coar.se granules or stumpy tubercles, which 

 are acute or thorny at tip; arms annulated l)y conspicuous 

 zones of densely set compound hooks; interannuli of arms 

 covered with coarse granules, which are arranged more or less 

 clearly in two series Astrothamnus. 



AA — Disk covered with very fine, smooth granules, often beset 

 with a number of smooth, stmnpy tubcri-les; arms rather 

 inconsj)icuously annulated, each annulus consisting of four 

 rows of granules, the middle two liook-bearing, while tlie 

 others are smooth; interannuli covered by a pavement of 

 very fine granules, among whifh many oval, sunken plates 

 are present Astrotoma, restr. 



In the arm coverings, Astrothamnus is similar to Asfrulhromhus 

 and Astrothorax, while Astrotoma, re.str., resembles Astroclon. Thus 

 the Astrotominie fall naturally into two groups, one of which includes 

 the first three genera, and the other the last two, 



Aitrothamnns echinaceas (Mntsumoto).

the radial furrow. Radial rihs imuh raised, largo, occupying almost 

 the wJiolc tlorsal surface of disk, hut leaving between them ten 

 narrow furrows radiating from the centre; closely covered with 

 rather large stumpy tubercles with thorny crowns, between which 

 lie thick, irregularly polygonal jilates. Ventral interbrachial areas 

 strongly concave, closely covered with stumpy tubercles terminating 

 with one or a few thorny points. Genital slits rather large, more 

 or less parallel. 



Madreporic shield small, irregular in outline. Areas proximal to 

 ventral interbrachial regions closely covered with spiny, stumpy 

 tubercles. Oral angles ventrally projected, covered with conical 

 and acute tubercles, which become, near mouth, more or less indis- 

 tinguishable from dental papilUe. Teeth and dental papilla similar, 

 conical, very acute. Oral papilhe absent; sides of oral angles naked. 



Arms rather slender, long, uniformly tapered outwards, distinctly 

 annulated by double rows of coarse granules, which are entirely 

 covered with densely set, minute, compound hooks; interannuli 

 covered with coarse, smooth granules arranged in two irregular 

 rows, ^'entro-laterally on either side of arm, in line with interannuli, 

 there is a series of large, round, smooth plates. At the arm bases, 

 the hook-covered annuli are usually broken in the dorsal median 

 line by conical granules terminating with one or a few thorny points. 

 Ventral side of arms with rather well-spaced tubercles, which are 

 conical or tenninate with one or a few thorny points; these tubercles 

 become rounded and smooth distally. First and second tentacle 

 pores free of arm spines; third with one or two spines; fourth with 

 two or three; remainder with three. Arm spines of basal joints 

 more or less indistinguishable from conical or thorned tubercles, 

 but remainder peg-like, nearly as long as corresponding arm joint, 

 and bearing two or three denticles at tip. Oral tentacle pores, as 

 well as first and second arm tentacle pores, open by means of short 

 tubes, which bear a few spinules on the sides. Color in alcohol: 

 dull grayish purple. 



Two specimens, Sagami Sea. 



In Koehler's species, vecors and rigens, the brachial ventral surfaces 

 are smooth and the oral angles, as well as the spaces just proximal 

 to the ventral interbrachial areas, are provided with slender spines, 

 while in A. bellator (Koehler), as well as in the present species, the 

 brachial ventral surfaces, oral angles and the oral spaces referred to 

 are provided with coarse, stumpy granules or tubercles. The present 

 «pecies, however, differs from A. bellator in fewer and distinctly longer

Astrotoma Lyman (non Koehler). 



As I have referred Kochler's three species, which he placed in 

 Astrotoma, to Astrothamnus, Astrotoma, restr., now includes A. 

 agassizi Lyman, A. murrayi Lyman, ..4. sobrina Matsumoto, and 

 A. waitei Benham, the first being the genotype.

Pl.VlI, figs. 14-146. 



Though the present Japanese form was identified as A. murrayi 

 by Doderlein, I have failed to find any specimen from Japan that 

 strictly corresponds to Lyman's description and figures of the Moluc- 

 can species, so that I am obliged to look upon the Japanese form as 

 distinct from A. murrayi. It differs from that species in the much 

 shorter arms, in the narrower brachial lobes of the disk (narrower 

 outwards than inwards), in the longer genital slits, in the fewer and 

 larger stumpy tubercles in the .spaces just proximal to the ventral 

 interbrachial areas, and in the comparatively fewer arm spines. 

 The type .specimen measures 34 nmi. across disk and 200 mm. in arm 

 length, while A. murrayi is described as 29 mm, across the disk and 

 280 mm. in arm length. The brachial lobes of the disk are not so 

 wide as in ^. murrayi, and are narrower outwards than inwards, 

 in.stead of the reverse. The genital slits extend from the inner 

 corners of the ventral interbrachial areas nearly to the disk margin. 

 The spaces just proximal to the ventral interbrachial areas are beset 

 with a few large stumpy tubercles, instead of numerous small ones. 

 First tentacle pore free of arm spines; second with one or two; 

 third, two or three; fourth, three or four; and succeeding, four, or 

 sometimes three. In .4. murrayi, four or sometimes five arm spines 

 are pre.'^ent at each tentacle pore, even on the very basal arm joints. 

 However, .4. sobrina is very clo.se to A. murrayi, the covering of the 

 disk and arms l)eing fjuite similar in the two species. But I consider 

 that this similarity is generic; rather than specific, as I have observed 

 that the arm covering of the genotype, A. agassizi, is also precisely 

 similar to that of the present species.

Ophiacantha bisquamata sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 6 mm. Length of arms 34 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 nmi. Disk pentagonal, with nearly straight or 

 slightly convex interbrachial l)orders, closely covered with fine 

 granules, of which eight or nine lie in 1 mm. Radial shields entirely

 reaching the di.sk margin. 



Oral shields small, rhomboidal, with convex inner sides and rounded 

 outer angle, nearly as long as, or slightly longer than wide, in contact 

 with the first lateral arm plates. Adoral shields small, triangular, 

 pointed inwards, meeting each other. Five or six oral papillae on 

 either side of each jaw; the outermo.st two are flat and leaf-like, 

 protecting the second oral tentacle pore; the others are very narrow 

 and acute; the innermost one, which pairs with that of the other 

 side, is infradental. Four or five teeth in a single vertical row, more

or less stout, obtuse. Arms composed of rather short and wide 

 joints, uniformlj' tapered. Dorsal arm plates rhomboidal, wth 

 very obtuse inner angle, wider than long, with a more or less distinct 

 median keel, so that the dorsal side of the arm is keeled as a whole. 

 Lateral arm plates with prominent spine ridges, meeting neither 

 above or below. First ventral arm plate very small, quadrangular, 

 with concave inner side, longer than wide; those following, mod- 

 erately large, pentagonal, \vith convex, but slightly notched, outer 

 side and rounded outer angles, nearly as long as wide. Six arm 

 spines long, flattened, more or less curved, truncate, translucent, 

 not serrate; uppermost or upper second spine longest, about twice 

 and a half as long as corresponding arm joint; lowest one, shortest, 

 slightly longer than arm joint. Two oval, thin, leaf-like tentacle 

 scales to each pore. Color in alcohol: disk grayish brown, with or 

 without white patches on dorsal side at insertion of arm bases; 

 arms banded with grayish brown and white. The grayish brown and 

 white in alcohol correspond, in life, to dark green and vivid red, 

 respectively. 



Two specimens: off Oshima, Sagami Sea; 75-85 fathoms. 



Ophiothamnus venuBtus sp. nov. 



This species is very near Ophiomilra habrotata H. L. Clark, but 

 I have some doubt as to the identity of the two species, since certain 

 differences are observable between them as now known. The 

 present species has fine, acute, scattered spines on the disk, without 

 any of the large, conspicuous spines, characteristic of 0. habrotata. 

 The arm spines of the present species are eight to ten in number to 

 each lateral arm plate on free basal arm joints. 



Numerous specimens; off Inatori, Izu, Sagami Bay. 



The internal structure of the present species is quite similar to 

 those of the genotype, 0. vicarius Lyman, the peristonial plates 

 being triple, the genital plates situated above the basal vertebra, 

 the genital scales absent and the generative glands lined by an 

 unfolded membrane, which contains fine scales, as seen under a 

 microscope. 



The species referred to Ophiothamnus by modern systeraatists 

 are of a type not considered Ophiothamnus by Lyman, while certain 

 species, which are quite congeneric with Lyman's type of the present 

 genus, have been referred to other genera. For examples, Ophioleda 

 minima and Ophioplinthaca occlusa of Koehler, and Ophiomitra 

 habrotata H. L. Clark, are, in my opinion, genuine Ophiothamnus, 

 while Ophiomitra exigua Lyman (referred to Ophiothamnus by

 and Mortonscn, and Ophiolhamnus dultus Koeliler are not genuine 

 Ophiothamnus, hut belong to u distinct type, which awaits a name, 

 being more or less related to Ophiomytis and Ophioplinlhaca. 

 Ophiolebes taberosas ^p. nov. 



Diameter of disk 10 mm. Length of arms 38 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 mm. Disk five-lobed, with strongly concave 

 interbrachial borders, deeply hollowed at the central region, covered 

 by a thick, cereous skin, which contains well-spaced, thick, rounded 

 scales of various sizes; beset with several short, conical, stout, 

 obtuse tubercles, which are larger and more numerous on the radial 

 shields. Radial shields also covered by the skin, long, narrow, 

 bar-like, strongly raised, about two-thirds as long as the disk radius. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas covered by a skin similar to that of the 

 dorsal side, the scales and tubercles being, however, smaller. Genital 

 slits large, long, but not reaching disk margin. Oral shields small, 

 thick, rhomboidal, wider than long, with wide, rounded outer angle 

 and convex surface. Adoral shields large, quadrangular, with 

 perfectly rounded outer angles and strongly convex surface, wider 

 without than within, meeting each other. Between each pair of 

 oral plates occurs a more or less distinct buccal pore. Three, or 

 sometimes four, oral papillas on either side, conical and blunt; inner 

 ones smaller; outermost papilla, very large and stout. Oral papillae 

 project laterally beyond radial axis, and those on opposite sides of 

 each oral slit are placed alternately. Teeth conical, stout, obtuse. 



Arms slender, covered by a thin, cereous skin. Dorsal arm plates 

 two to each joint; proximal plate small, quadrangular, wider than 

 long, with a convex surface; on distal part of arm it becomes longer 

 than wide; distal plate large, fan-shaped, much wider than long, 

 and with a convex surface. Dorsal side of arm bases covered l^y 

 continuation of disk covering, so that it bears thick, rounded scales 

 of various siz€\s in place of dorsal arm plates. Lateral arm plates 

 somewhat flaring, meeting below for a short distance. First ventral 

 arm plate comparatively large, hexagonal, with concave inner side 

 and convex surface, widest at the lateral angles, as long as, or slightly 

 longer than, wide, in contact with the next plate; the latter is the 

 largest of all, pentagonal, widest at lateral angles, as long as, or 

 slightly longer than, wide, with convex surface and a conspicuous 

 notch in distal margin; following plates separated from each other, 

 rhomboidal, with a conspicuous notch in distal margin, with strongly 

 convex surface; distally they become smaller, oval or rounded, and

the surface is so convex that they appear Hke hemispherical tubercles. 

 Arm spines five in number on proximal joints, but four distally; 

 they are conical, blunt, solid, terete; dorsal ones longer and stouter; 

 uppermost about one and a half times, and lowest about two-thirds, 

 as long as corresponding arm joint. Tentacle scales absent. Color 

 in alcohol: yellowish brown. 



Numerous specimens; Okino?^ (a submarine bank). Sagami Sea. 



In younger specimens, the skin, which covers the disk and arms, 

 is very thick and the buccal pores are often indistinct.

This species closely resembles Ophioceramis ? obstricta Lyman 

 (= Ophiomoeris obstricta Koehler, 1904 = Ophiurases obstridus Clark, 

 1911), but differs in two important points. The radial shields are 

 distinctly joined in pairs di.stally for half their length. A numl)er 

 of large, prominent, spherical tubercles are present on the disk, 

 irregularly arranged along the distal margin of the radial plates, along 

 the joining line of each pair of radial shields, and often al.^o along 

 the outer borders of the same. In the last character, the present 

 species reminds us of Ophioayptis nodosa. The type specimen 

 measures 4 mm. across the disk, 13 mm. in the arm length and 1.5 

 mm. in the arm width at base. Color in alcohol: disk gray, anns

(Characters as given above in key.) 



This family includes AmphUepis and Ophiochytra, besides a new 

 genus, Amphiactis. Though almost similar to the next in external 

 features, this family suggests the Ophiacanthidse in many internal 

 structures.

triangular, with pointed ends; dental papilla? absent. Peristomal 

 plat^^s large, entire. Oral frames long and slender in internal view, 

 without well-developed lateral w4ngs. Vertebrae of distal arm joints 

 often incompletely divided bj' a series of pores. Arm spines few. 

 Tentacle scales present, one or two to each pore. 



This genus includes Amphiura canescens, duplicata, and patula 

 of Lyman; Atnphiura partita, Ophiactis dissidens and 0. parata of 

 Koehler, besides the genotype, Amphiactis umbonata sp. nov. 



Certain representatives of the present genus were referred to 

 Amphiura by Lyman, and then to Ophiactis by Liitken and Mor- 

 tensen. Amphiactis differs from Amphiura and its allies in the 

 absence of paired infradental papillae, and from Ophiactis in the more 

 numerous papillae, which are arranged in a continuous series so as to 

 close the oral slits. Further, the contrast of the present genus and 

 the Amphiuridce in many internal structures is decidedly striking. 

 Amphiactis much resembles Ophiochytra, especially 0, tenuis Ljanan, 

 but differs from it in the well -developed radial shields. 



Amphiactis umbonata sp. nov. 



Diameter of disk 7 mm. Length of arms 30 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.2 mm. Disk circular, flat, covered with rather 

 coarse, irregular scales, among which the primaries are distinct. 

 Central plate large, circular, encircled by ten small scales, which 

 correspond to infrabasals and basals in position. Radial plates 

 large, larger than central plate, with strongly curved outer border, 

 which almost forms a semicircle. The central and radial plates 

 have each a small l)ut distinct central boss. The second radials and 

 the first to third interradials may also be distinguished, being larger 

 than the secondary scales, which arc irregular in size and in arrange- 

 ment. Thus, the disk squamation is rather similar to that of 

 Ophiozona. Radial shields comparatively small, oblong ovate, about 

 two-fiftlis as long as disk radius, twice as long as wide, wider without 

 than within, more convex abradially than adradially, separated by 

 a row of three or four plates, of which the inner ones are larger than 

 the outer. In each interradial area there are five to seven irregu- 

 larly radiating rows of scales. \'cntral interbrachial areas covered 

 with more or less coarse, irregular .scales. Genital slits long, nearly 

 reaching disk margin, (lenital scales invisible in external view. 



Oral shields small, rliomtjoidal, with acute mner angle, lateral 

 and outer angles rounded, inner sides slightly concave. Adoral 

 shields f|uadrangular, wider without than within, nearly or quite 

 uiet'tiug within. Four oral pai)illu' on either side, inner ones snuiller

and more acute. Dt'oj) in oral slits, on either side of each jaw. occurs 

 an additional pai)illa, which is conical and acute. Five teeth, all 

 obtuse, except uppermost, which is acute. 



Arms slender, flattened, uniformly tapering distally. Dorsal arm 

 plates large, fan-shaped, twice as wide as long; inner sides slightly 

 convex, forming an obtuse angle within; di.stal margin decidedly 

 convex; outer angles rounded; successive plates separated by 

 lateral arm plates, except the basal two or three, which are in contact 

 with each other. Lateral arm plates low, not verj' prominent. 

 First ventral arm plate small, divided into two secondary plates, 

 of which the inner one is triangular and the outer quadrangular; 

 those following, large, hexagonal (except second, which is pentag- 

 onal), much wider than long, widest at outer lateral angles, with 

 concave lateral sides, distal and proximal margins slightly convex; 

 swollen along the outer margins and especially distally, so that 

 arm appears keeled along ventral median line. Arm spines three, 

 subequal, about as long as corresponding arm joint (uppermost 

 slightly longer), cylindrical, tapered and blunt. Two flat, oval 

 tentacle scales to each pore, but sometimes three on the first. Color 

 in alcohol: white. 



Two specimens; Sagami vSea. 



The internal structures of the present species are essentially 

 similar to those of Amphilepis norvegica Ljungman. The peristomal 

 plates are simple, very large. The oral frames are entire, witiiout 

 lateral wings. The oral plates in internal view are very slender and 

 long. The dental plates are absent, so that the teeth arise directly 

 from the oral plates. The genital plates are free from, instead of 

 being fixed to, the basal vertebrae. The genital plate and radial 

 shield of either side of a radius articulate with each other bj^ means 

 of a conspicuous, ball-like condyle on the former and of a large 

 socket in the latter. The genital scales are flat, thin, leaf-like. The 

 vertebrae are very slender, the distal ones being incompletely divided 

 into halves by a series of pores. The first five characters and the 

 last are rather Laemophiuridan, but the other two, the sixth and 

 seventh, are strictly Gnathophiuridan.

Subfamily 1. OPHIACTIXIX.E nov. 



(Characters as given above in key). 



This subfamily includes Ophiadis, Hemipholis,^ Ophiopns and 

 Ophiopholis. 



Subfamily 2. AMPHIURIN.E. 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily includes Amphiophis, Amphilimna, Amphiodia, 

 Ophiophragmus, Ophiocnida, Amphipholis, Ophiostigma, Amphiura,* 

 Ophionema, Paramphiura, Ctenatnphiura, Ophiocenirus,^ etc. 



The first two genera may be grouped as an Amphioplus-group, 

 the next three as an Amphiodia-gwup, the following two as an 

 Amphipholis-group, and the last five as an Amphiura-group. The 

 Amphipholis-gronp are very easily distinguished, while the other 

 three groups are less so. These groups may be distinguished as 

 follows : 



Three classes of oral papilla? may be recognized: the first arising 

 from the adoral shields, the second from the oral plates, and the 

 third from the dental plates and being infradental in position. A 

 papilla, which arises partially from the adoral shield and partially 

 from the oral plate, is referred to the second class. Now, let -f I 

 indicate the presence of papillse of the first class, —I the absence of 

 same; +11 the presence of papillae of the second class, etc. Then, 

 the groups of genera are formulizod as follows: 



Amphioplus-gToup = +1 +11 +III. 



Amphiodia-gToup = —I +11 +III. 



A}nphiph(Ai.'<-gTOup = —I +11 +III. 



Amphiura-group = +1 ±11 +III. 



It may clearly be .seen that the Amphiodia-group are not inter- 

 mediate between Amphioi)bis- and Am])hi'um-gronp, but are, sa}', 

 the A mphiopl US-group without the papillie of the first class, while 

 the Amphinra-gronp are the Amphioplus-group without all or most 

 of the i)ai)illa' of the second cIjuss. I believe that certain species 

 having two distal papillie, usually referred to Amphiodiu, are really 

 referable to Amphiurn.

 semilunar, one-third as long as disk radius, twice as long as wide, 

 joined in pairs, being, however, separated only at proximal end, 

 which is obtusely jiointed. A row of large and squarish scales 

 borders disk. Scales of ventral interbrachial areas just outside 

 this marginal series turned up, so as to form the sort of fence 

 characteristic of genus. Marginal scales more Elevated than arms; 

 ventral interbrachial areas strongly convex below. Genital slits 

 long. 



Oral shields rhomboidal, with inner sides much longer than outer, 

 inner angle very acute, outer and lateral angles rounded; much 

 longer than wide. Adoral shields triangular, tapered within to a

 affinities to the present species.

Amphipholis japonica sp. nov. 



This species is extremely near .4. squamata, being distinguistied 

 from it merely by certain trifling differences. I have compared the 

 Japanese material with specimens of A. squamata from Naples. In 

 Neapolitan specimens the arms are two and a half to three times as 

 long as the disk diameter, while in Japanese specimens they are 

 three to four times as long as the same. The distal margin of the 

 ventral arm plates of Neapolitan specimens is nearly straight, while 

 that of Japanese specimens is considerably convex. In the last 

 character the present species resembles A. australiana H. L. Clark, 

 differing, however, from that species in the more numerous disk 

 scales of the dorsal side and in the coarser disk scales of the ventral 

 side. The radial shields have each a white spot at the outer end, 

 quite as in A. squamata. 



Like .4. squamata, the present species is viviparous. In smnmer, 

 the larger individuals contain several embryos. I once dissected 

 out six embryos from an adult. Animals containing full-grown 

 embryos appear to give birth to them the niglit after they are placed 

 in an aquarium. 



This species is common in the neighborhood of Misaki. and is 

 found living under stones on fine sand. As to the sensibility of this 

 species to the coarseness of sand, the following observations were 

 made at Arai Beach, Misaki Marine Biological Station. In the 

 summer of 1910, the beach was at first al>undantly supplied with 

 small areas among rocks covered with fine sand, and this oi)hiuran 

 was found very aV)undantly ; after a heavy storm, very few individuals 

 were found, owing to the fact that the sjiots with fine sand were 

 mo.stly wiped out. In the summer of 1911, the spots witii fine sand 

 were very few, and this ophiuran was seldom found. In the siiiniiicr 

 of 1912, the l)each was entirely covered with coarse sand, and 1 

 could no more find this ophiuran. It is a very active spcM-ies, (juickly 

 concealing it.s(4f in the sand when the stone is lurned up.

Subfamily 1. OPIIIOMASTINM: nov. 



(Characters as given in key p. 75.) 



This subfamily includes Ophiomastus, Ophiotypa, Ophiomisidium, 

 Ophiophi/cis, Anthophiura, Ophiopyrgu-s, Ophiochrj/sis, Ophiosteira, 

 Gijmnophiura, Ophiura, Ophionotus, Ophioperla, Ophiotjalfa, Ophio- 

 gona, OphiopUnthus, Ophiopleura, Ophioden and provisionally 

 Astrophiuro, besides five now genera, Hoplophiura, Aspidophiura, 

 Atnphiophiura, Stegophinra and Ophiurolepis. 



Koehler's recently described genus Ophiomisidium includes Ophio- 

 musium puIcheUum Wyville Thomson, 0. flabellum Lyman, and 

 0. speciosum Koehler, the last being the genotype. The group 

 evidently stands between Ophiomastus and Ophiophycis in systematic 

 position. 



HAPLOPHIUEA. gen. nov. 



Disk high, much elevated above arms, covered above with plates 

 and scales, among which the primaries are very prominent, and 

 below with close-set, fine granules. Radial shields stout, joined 

 in pairs. Oral papillse soldered together. Genital plates and 

 scales present, but invisible in external view. Genital bursae absent 

 and genital slits invisible. Anns short, low, wider than high, covered 

 with convex arm plates. Tentacle pores, including second oral 

 ones, which open entirely outside oral slits, naked, being free from 

 scales. Arm spines few, minute. 



This new genus contains only a single species, Ophiozona gymno- 

 pora H. L. Clark. 



ASPIDOPHIURA gon nov. 



Disk rather high, elevated above arms, flat, covered with very 

 stout primaries and radial shields, besides often a few smaller scales. 

 Ventral interbrachial areas covered by a very large plate, besides 

 ver>' .stout genital scales. Arm combs and genital papillse present. 

 Oral shields purse-shaped, with a beak-like inner process. Oral 

 papillse soldered together. Second oral tentacle pores open entirely 

 outside oral slits, slit-like, guarded by numerous small scales. Arms 

 rather short, strongly knotted, with long arm joints. Dorsal arm 

 plates verj' rudimentary' or entirely absent. Ventral arm plates 

 small, rhomboidal or triangular. Tentacle pores present only on 

 several proximal ann joints, provided with few or no scales. Three 

 short, conical arm spines. 



This genus includes Ophioghjpha viinuta Lyman and 0. forbesi 

 Duncan ( = Ophiura glyptodisca H. L. Clark), besides the genotype,

Aspidophiura watasei sp. nov. It stands rather between Antho- 

 phiura and a certain group of Amphiophium with very conspicuous 

 ventral interbrachial phites. 



Aspidophiura watasei sp. nov. 



This species is very near .1. forbcsi, but differs from it chieHy in 

 the presence of a central boss to each of the six primary plates, in 

 the smaller radial shields, which are about as large as the radial 

 plates, in the ventral arm plates, which more rapidly diminish in 

 size outwards, in the longer arm spines, which are longer than half 

 the corresponding arm joint, and in the absence of tentacle scales 

 beyond the disk. 



The present .species differs from A. minuia chiefly in the presence 

 of a central boss to each of the six primaries, in the smaller radial 

 shields and in the l)etter-devel<)ped arm combs. 



The type specimen is o mm. across the disk with arms prol)ably 

 about twice the disk diameter, and 1..3 mm. in width. Color in 

 alcohol: disk yellowish gray above and white below; arms white. 



One specimen; Sagami Sea. One specimen; Uraga Channel. 



AMFHIOPHIURA u- n. nov. 



Disk high, often convex, covered with plates and scales, among 

 which the prunaries are very prominent. Radial shields stout, 

 joined in pairs. Arm combs and genital i)apillie present. Oral 

 shields oval, pyriform or trefoil. Second oral tentacle pores open 

 more or less, or entirely, outsid(> oral slits; large, guarded by numerous 

 scales. Arms moderately long, gradually tapering outwards, with 

 blunt tips. Dorsal and ventral arm plates fairly well developed; 

 succes.sive plates in contact with each other at least on jiroximal 

 arm joints. Lateral arm plates high, with few to numerous short, 

 {)eg-like arm spines. Tentacle pores large, with numerous scales. 



This new genus includes Ophioijhiphn hiiUntn Wyville Thom.son, 

 which is here designated as the genotype; also the following species

The grouj) with very lar^;e oral shields or with very conspicuous

 hand and Aspidophiiira on the other; the group with ventral inter- 

 brachial areas covered with many scales and with quadrangular 

 ventral arm plates apj^roaches Gymnophiura on the one hand and 

 Stegopliiura {vide infra) on the other; and the group with ventral 

 interhraehial areas covered with many scales, arid with axe-shaped 

 ventral arm plates, approaches true Ophiura, restr. (vide infra). 



GYMNOPHIURA Lutken and Mortensen, 1899 (restr.). 



Disk high, covered by a naked skin. Radial shields long, narrow, 

 bar-like, widely separated from each other, covered by skin. Arm 

 combs and genital papillae present. Oral shields comparatively 

 small, pentagonal, with notched lateral .sides. Second oral tentacle 

 pores opened partially outside the oral slits, large, with numerous 

 scales. Arms moderately long, very gradually tapered outwards, 

 with blunt extremity. Dorsal and ventral arm plates well developed, 

 successive plates widely in contact with each other. Lateral arm 

 plate< high, with numerous minute, peg-like arm spines. Tentacle 

 pores large, with numerous scales. 



This genus, as restricted, contains but a single species, G. mollis 

 Lutken and Mortensen. Another species, viz., G. coerulescens, is, 

 in my opinion, referable to genuine Ophiura, and is probably con- 

 specific with, or at least closely allied to, Ophiura flagellata (Lyman). 

 Gymnophiura is very near Amphiophiura, especially the group 

 with ventral interhraehial areas covered with many scales, and with 

 quadrangular ventral arm plates, Ijut differs from it in the naked 

 disk and in the radial .shields, which are narrow, bar-like, skin-covered 

 and widely .separated from each other. 



STEGOPHIURA gen. nov. 



Disk high, covered with plates and scales, among which the 

 primaries are prominent. Radial shields stout, joined distally. 

 Arm combs and genital papillse present. Oral shields oval or pyri- 

 form. Second oral tentacle pores open more or less, or entirely. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 79 



outside oral slit.s, large, provided with numerous scales. Arms very 

 short., very stout at base, higher than wide, rapidly tapering distally, 

 with acute tip. Dorsal and ventral arm plates well developed, 

 successive plates widely in contact with each other. Lateral arm 

 plates high, with numerous arm spines, often unequal and arranged 

 in two series. Tentacle pores large, with numerous scales. 



This genus includes Ophiura nodosa and sluwitzii of Liitken, Ophio- 

 glijpha elevata Lyman, 0. sculpla, sladeni (= Ophiura stiphra H. L. 

 Clark), and striata of Duncan, and 0. sterea and Ophiura hrachyaciis 

 of H. L. Clark, besides a new species, Stegophiura vivipara. 



The genotype is Ophiura nodosa Ltk. Stegophiura much resembles 

 a certain group of Amphiophiura, but differs in the shorter, .stouter 

 and more rapidly tapering arms with more acute tips. 

 Stegophiura vivipara sp nov. 



Diameter of disk mm. Length of arms 13 mm. Width of 

 arms at base 1.5 mm. Disk pentagonal, or circular (especially 

 when the animal contains many embryos), convex, covered with 

 fifty to sixty plates on the dorsal side, including the radial shields. 

 Central plate pentagonal. Five pentagonal radials, directly surround- 

 ing the central plate, laterally overlapping each other. In each 

 interradial space of dorsal side is a large scjuarish plate, wider than 

 long, in contact with radial shields; latter irregular in outline, about 

 as wide as long, one overlapping the other, instead of apposed to 

 each other in radial line. On ventral side of disk plates roundi'd 

 and knob-like, with furrows between. Genital papillae iilunt, close- 

 set, longer outwards and upwards, where they form small arm comics. 

 Oral shields pear-sliajx'd, much longer than wide, wider without 

 than within, with acute inner angles and perfectly rounded distal 

 margins. Adoral shields large, meeting within along their whole 

 length. Five oral papilhe on either wide, s(iuarish, short, wide, 

 close-set; a pair of infradental papilla; at apex of each jaw, nnich 

 longer and stout<'r than the other oral papilhe, rather ol)tu.sely 

 pointed. Five teeth, very small, clososet, obtusely pointed. .\rms 

 very short, stout at base, rapidlj' tapered distally. Dorsal arm 

 plates fan-shaped, al)out as wide as long, convex dorsally. Lateral 

 arm plates convex, tlujse of the two sides separated i»oth above and 

 below on the basal arm joints. First ventral arm plate large, tri- 

 angular, with obtuse inner angle and convex outer side, wider than 

 long; the following plates are octagonal, with very short proximo- 

 lateral and disto-lateral sides, the fonner concav*' at tentacle pores; 

 wifler than long, wirier without than within: from the six or seventh

outwards, the plates are longer than wide, liexagonal, witli very 

 short proximal and proximo-lateral sides, concave lateral margins 

 and a very convex distal side. Arm s])ines seven or eight, including 

 the tentacle scales, on the free basal joints, fine, conical, short; 

 middle ones longer than upper and lower ones, anil about half as 

 long as corresj)onding arm joint; diminishing in number outwards; 

 the lower spines are much finer and serve as tentacle scales. Second 

 oral tentacle pore, very large, opening outsitle oral slit, boundeil by 

 three or four .scales on each side. Tentacle pores large, guarded 

 on basal joints by one to three aboral scales, besides the lower arm 

 spines on the adoral side. Color in alcohol: pale gray. 



Numerous specimens; Sagami Sea. Numerous specimens; Sagami 

 Sea, 75 and 100 fathoms. 



This species is viviparous. I once dissected out twenty-four 

 embryos of various sizes from a single adult. 



OPHIUROLEPIS gen. nov. 



Disk covered with larger rounded plates and smaller scales, the 

 former surrounded bj' belts of the latter. Radial shields moderately 

 large, rounded, separated from each other. Adoral shields oval, 

 with rounded inner border and obtusely pointed outer end. One 

 to three supplementary plates are present in each space between the 

 adoral shields and oral plates. Teeth and oral papilla present, the 

 latter very close set. Arm combs, as well as genital papillie, absent. 

 Arms long, stout, very gradually tapered. Dorsal arm plates very 

 well developed, widely in contact with each other. Lateral arm 

 plates low. Ventral arm plates triangular, nearly or scarcely in 

 contact with each other. Second oral tentacle pores open entirely 

 outside oral slits, long, slit-like, closed by tentacle .scales, which 

 are modified so as to appear like supplementary plates. A single 

 arm spine and three tentacle scales, both being minute and peg-like. 



This new genus contains a single species, Ophiolepis carinata 

 Studer, 1876 ( = Ophiofjbjpha deshayesi Lyman). 



Ophiurolepis is very peculiar in every feature, as it is certainly 

 not referaVjle to Ophiura, even in a wide sense. The disk squamation 

 reminds us of that of Ophiolepis.

OPHIOZONELLA Rtn. nov. 



Disk covcroil with stout platos. niiii<j;l(Hl with smaUor ones. Radial 

 sliields very large; those of both sides of a radius separated from 

 each other by a single row of plates, or more or less in contact with 

 each other. No distinct trio of plates just outside and between each 

 pair of radial shields. Oral and adoral shields rather large. Teeth 

 and oral papilUr present ; the latter are thick and close-set. Genital 

 slits short, not reaching disk margin. Arms not very long, stout 

 at base, rather rapidly tapering tlistally to a slender and acute tip. 

 Dorsal and ventral arm plates rhomboidal, successive plates separated 

 from each other, at least, distal to arm base. Arm spines two to 

 four, short. One or two tentacle scales to each pore. 



This new genus includes the following species with two tentacle 

 scales: Ophiozona nivea, tesscUata, vidrmorea and clypeata of Lyman, 

 0. bispinosa and molesta of Koehler, and 0. elevata and platydisca 

 of H. L. Clark; and the following with only one tentacle scale: 

 0. insularia stellata, antillaruin and depressa of Lyman, 0. alba and 

 contigua of Liitken and Mortensen, 0. casta and projeda of Koehler, 

 0. tjalfiana Mortensen, and 0. polyplax and longispina of H. L. 

 Clark. The genotype is Ophiozona longispina H. L. Clark. 



Ophiozonclla includes deep-water forms and is allied to such genera 

 as Ophiocrates and Ophiomidas, while genuine Ophiozona includes 

 littoral forms and is very close to Ophiolepis and Ophiothyreus. 



OPHIOZONA Lyman, 18G5 (restr.). 



Disk covered with very numerous small plates and scales, the 

 larger surrounded by belts of smaller. Radial shields small, widely 

 separated from each other by several plates and numerous scales. 

 A noticeable trio of plates is distinguishable just outside and between 

 each pair of radial shields. Oral and adoral shields small. Teeth 

 and oral papillae present, latter very thick and close-set. Genital 

 slits rather long. Arms long, rather slender, very gradually tapering 

 distally, with blunt tips. Dorsal, as well as ventral, arm plates 

 well developed, quadrangular, successive plates widely in contact 

 with each other throughout the entire length of the arm. Four or 

 five short, peg-like arm spines. Two tentacle scales to each pore, 

 more or less oval in common outline. 



This genus, as here restricted, includes only Ophiolepis impressa 

 and pacifica of Liitken (the two species on which Ophiozona was 

 based by LjTnan). The genotype is 0. impressa. 



The Ophiolepidinse comprises two groups, one of which includes 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 83 



genera witli well-tleveloped, quadrangular dorsal and ventral arm 

 plates and the other those with more or less rudimentary dorsal 

 and ventral arm plates. The first group, including littoral forms, 

 is again divided into two sections, one of which, including Ophio- 

 thyreus, Ophiozona and Ophiolepis, is characterized by the presence 

 of a di.stinct trio of plates just outsitle and between each pair of 

 radial shields and by the presence of two tentacle .scales, which are 

 oval in common outline; while the other, including Ophioceramis 

 and Ophioplocus, is characterized by the al)S(.'nce of a distinct trio 

 of plates just outside and between each pair of radial shields, and 

 by the presence of three to five tentacle scales, which surround the 

 pore. The distinction of Ophiolepis and Ophiozona from each other 

 depends ujion the presence or absence of supplementary dorsal arm 

 plates. From a certain point of view, I believe that Ophiozona is 

 more closely allied to Ophiolepis than to Ophiozonclla. Ophiozona 

 is found in the \N'est Indies and on the Pacific side of Panama. The 

 faunae of the two sides of Panama stand in a very intimate relation 

 to each other. The distril)ution of Ophiozona and that of Ophio- 

 derma are equally interesting as illu.strating this truth.

 Genuine Ophioconis much resembles Cryptopelta, but has, however,

 Pedinura. but is, however, covered with fine spines, instead of granules, 

 on the disk. "Ophioconis" indica Koehler, which I do not dare to 

 name generically, as I have not myself examined it, appears to 

 resemble Pedinura, except for the hyaline arm spines and the presence 

 of a single tentacle scale on most of the tentacle pores, instead of two.

 each other. Vertebrse of distal arm joints often imperfectly divided 

 into halves by a longitudinal series of pores. Six or more arm 

 spines, long, flattened, hyaline, not appressed. Single tentacle scale 

 to each pore. 



The genotype is Ophioconis grandisquama Koehler, and it is worth 

 noting that a specimen of this species was recently collected at 

 Okinos^ (a submarine bank), in the Sagami Sea. 



OPHIUROCHJETA gen. nov. 



Disk closely covered with fine granules and sparsely beset v.ith 

 fine spines. Oral angles also granulated, but oral shields naked. 

 Numerous close-set oral papillse, of which outermost one is pointed 

 inwards, stretching above next papilla, which is the largest. Teeth 

 triangular and obtusely pointed. Arms not very long, rather stout, 

 stoutest at base. Dorsal, as well as ventral, arm plates well devel- 

 oped, widely in contact with each other. Six or more arm spines, 

 long, flagellate, opaque, not appressed. Two tentacle scales to each 

 pore, abradial one overlapping base of lowest arm spine. 



The genotype is Ophiochccta mixta Lyman. 



Ophiurochceta differs from Ophiolimna in the following important 

 particulars: more numerous oral papilla?, of which the outermost 

 one is not operculiform, but pointed inwards above the next papilla, 

 which is the largest; well-developed dorsal and ventral arm plates, 

 ■which are widely in contact with each other, two tentacle scales, 

 of which the abradial one distinctly overlaps the base of the lowest 

 arm spine; triple peristomal plates. Verrill considers that the 

 internal structures of 0. mixta are much like those of Ophiacantha; 

 but my own oi)inion is c|uit(; to the contrary. 



I have observed that the internal structures of Ophiuroconis 

 monolepis, Ophiurodon grandisquama, Ophiurochreta mixta, Ophi- 

 arachna incrassata, Ophiochiton fastigatus, Ophioplax lameUosa, etc., 

 belong to a common type. In them the peristomal plates are always 

 triple, consisting of two paired and one median secondary plates; 

 while in Ophiacantha, Ophiolimna, etc., the peristomal plates are 




19 15. J NATLKAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 87 



entire, or double with soldered halves, and always lack a third, 

 median secondary plate. Further, the peristomal plates of the 

 former type are distinctly longer in proportion to their width than 

 are those of the latter. 



Ignoring the smaller size, Ophiurochceta much resembles Ophi- 

 arachna, the only essential differences being the presence of scattered 

 disk spinps and the absence of accessory oral shields. The systematic 

 value of the accessory oral shields is, however, considered insignificant 

 by Dr. H. L. Clark. I have also observed the absence of the acces- 

 sory oral shields in some interradii of a specimen of Ophiarachna 

 incrassata. One may safely say, then, that the relation of Ophiu- 

 rochceta to Ophiarachna is parallel to that of Ophiomastix to Ophio- 

 coma or of Ophiochwla to Pectinura.

 other they are indistinctly represented by one or two small scales, 

 which are separated from the oral shield by granules. The adoral

This new species is very near B. lacerlosa (Lyman), but differs 

 from it in the coarser disk granules, in the smaller naked part of the 

 radial shields, in the more strongly ridged dorsal arm i;)lates, in the 

 much lower lateral arm plates, in the wider antl rhomljoidal ventral

 It is, however, distinguished from 0. Ijunymani by the presence of 

 primary disk plates, by coarser disk scales, by shape of radial shields, 

 by the disk margin l)eing not so closely granulated, and by the shape 

 of the oral shields; from 0. custos ijy the presence of primary disk 

 plates, by coarser disk scales, by the shape of the radial shields, by 

 the adoral shields not meeting each other within, by the shape of 

 the first and second ventral arm plates, by the presenc.' of lamellar 

 plates at the arm bases, and by shape of dorsal arm plates; and 

 from O. redncta by dorsal sid(; of disk l)eing free of granules, by 

 radial shields not being divergent, and by shape of ventral arm plates. 

 Disk covered with fine, imbricating scales, among which the six 

 primaries are more or less distinct; the radial j)lates are smaller and 

 le.ss conspicuous than the central plate. Radial shields triangular, 

 with acute inner angles, twice as long as wide; those of a pair are 

 nearly parallel, being separated from each other. Ventral inter- 

 brachial areas are closely covercMl with very fine granules. Oral 

 .shields large, triangular, with strongly curved outer border, less 

 curved lateral sides, obtuse inner angle and perfectly rounded lateral 

 angles. Adoral shields large, triangular, long, tapered within to an 

 acute point, Init they do not meet. Lamellar plates and fine granules 

 occur on dorsal and lateral surface of free arm bases. Dorsal arm 

 plates triangular at first, l)ut soon becoming quadrangular with 

 rounded outer corners and curved lateral borders, much wider 

 "without than within. First ventral arm plate is small, triangular, 

 with rounded angles, nearly as wide as long; tho.se beyond are 

 pentagonal, with an inwardly directed angle, which is covered by 

 the precerhng plate; outer border curved, and lateral borders con- 

 cave and bounded by tentacle pons. A single large, oval tentacle 

 scale occurs on the abradial side of each pon-; besides, on the adradial 

 side of a few basal pores, there are present one or two rudimentary 

 tentacle scales, more or less covered over l)y the al)radial one.

.\side from the j^rescnce of the .seeonihiry supi)lementary dorsal 

 arm plates, this genus seems to me to be distinguished from Ophio- 

 nereis principally by negative characters and different degrees of 

 development of certain common structures. Disk scales even and 

 exceedingly fine; no traee of marginal row of special disk scales; 

 no genital papilUp; arms much more slender than in Ophionereis. 

 Schizogonic reproduction may not be a generic character.

Diameter of disk 9 mm. Length of arms 68 mm. Width of 

 arms, at base 1.2 mm, at the widest part 1.5 mm. Disk circular, 

 slightly concave, rather soft, covered with fine imbricating scales, 

 which are rather obscured, so that the disk appears as though covered 

 by a thick skin. Radial shields very small, short, exceedingly 

 narrow, tapered within, widely separated from each other, hard to 

 detect. Ventral interbrachial areas covered with scales similar to 

 tho.se of the dorsal side, l)ut even more obscure. Genital slits large, 

 nearly reaching disk margin. No genital papillae. 



Oral shieltls rhomboidal, with obtuse inner angle and rounded 

 lateral and outer angles, nearly as wide as long, except madreporic 

 shield, which is decidedly longer than wide. Adoral shields small, 

 acutely tapered within, where they nearly or hardly meet. Four 

 or five oral papilliE on either side of each jaw, unequal, short, rounded, 

 but the outermost one, which is closely associated with the second 

 oral tentacle pore, has pointed inner end. Four teeth, short, stout, 

 with wide end. 



Arms long and very slender, narrowed at base, widest at one- 

 fourth to one-third of arm length. Dorsal arm plates mostly tri- 

 angular, with obtuse outwardly directed apex, rather small, wider 

 than long, successive plates slightly in contact with each other; 

 quadrangular in the more di.^tal parts. On either side of each dorsal 

 arm plate there occurs a large supplementary plate, whieh \n nearly 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



semicircular, about one-half as large a.s the dorsal arm plate, and 

 bounded along the distal border by one or two verj- insignificant 

 secondary supplementary plates, which, however, are present only 

 for a comparatively short distance near the arm base; two or three 

 first dorsal arm plates and their supplementary plates are smaller 

 than those beyond; supjilementary plates smaller outwards as 

 dorsal arm plates become (juadrangular, and finally disappear. 

 Lateral arm i:)lates not very prominent, me€*ting neither above nor 

 below. First ventral arm plate very small, rathor pentagonal, 

 longer than wide; those beyontl, (juadrangular, with rounded outer 

 lateral angles, truncated inner lateral angles and slightly notched 

 outer border, nearly as long as wide, but longer than wide distally. 

 Three arm spines, short, stout, flattened, l)lunt. One large, oval 

 tentacle .scale to each pore. Color in alcohol: grayish yellow; disk 

 reticulated, and arms Ijundcd, with dark jMirjilish brown. 



Three specimens; Enoshima. Numerous specimens; Arai Beach, 

 Misaki Marine Biological Station. 



The arm length varies from .six to eight times the disk diameter. 

 In smaller specimens the arm spines are less flattened; and in those 

 smaller than 4 mm. across the disk the secondary supplementary 

 dorsal arm plates are almost invisible. 



This species differs from the genotyjie, (J. didijdi.scii II. L. Clark, 

 in the shape of the dorsal arm plates, in the less distinct .secondary 

 supplementary dorsal arm plates and in the smaller and more insig- 

 nificant radial shields. Further, .schizog<mic reproduction has not 

 been observed in the present species, though I have examined many 

 very small specimens. (). markOmmri, as well as the genotyi)e,

Subfamily 2. OPHIOPSILIN.E nov. 



(Characters as given above in key.) 



This subfamily is formed by a single genus, Ophiopsila. 



Though Ophiopsila is referred to the Amphiurida) by certain 

 autliors, it fundamentally differs from the latter in the internal 

 structures. The oral frames have well-developed lateral wings, as 

 in the Amphiuridtc, OphiotrichicUe, Ophioceramis, Ophionereidinse 

 and Ophiocominie. The oral and dental plates are 7t-^haped (instead 

 of being x-shaped) in common outline in internal view, quite as in 

 Ophioceramis, the Ophionereidinse and Ophiocomina. The genital 

 plates are entirely free from the basal vertebrje and have tw^o condyles 

 and one pit at the outer end to match two condyles and one pit of 

 the radial shield, as an important characteristic of the Chilophiurida; 

 while those of the Amphiurida? and (Jphiotrichidas are firmly fixed 

 to the basal vertebra? and have only a single large condyle to match 

 one large socket of the radial shield. The genital scales are long, 

 narrow and bar-like, also a characteristic of the Chilophiurida; 

 while those of the Gnathophiurida are short, very flat and leaf-like. 

 As to the external characters, the presence of both oral and well- 

 developed dental papilla? hinders any reference of Ophiopsila to 

 either the Amphiurida? or Ophiotrichidse. In short, Ophiopsila is 

 referable only to the Ophiocomidae, being, however, distinguished 

 from the other genera of that family by certain characters of second- 

 ary importance.

..4 7iew hypothesis concerninq butterjlies. — It is known that a virgin 

 femal*' moth or butterfly of the Great Peacock, the Oak Egger, and 

 some other species attracts males of her kind from afar. 



No naturar^t has written of this matter more charmingly than 

 has Jean Henri Fabre.' Having se<iuestered such a fem;ile under a 

 wire-gauze cover, .scores of males came from woodsy distances to 

 seek her. Putting her in an air-tight cell, whether of paper, wood, 

 gla.ss, metal or cotton batting prevented the escape of her eflluvium 

 and therefore prevented the arrival of her suitors. If placed under 

 a bell glass, where she was i)lainly visible to the oncoming swarm 

 of mah"^. they ignored Iht and settled upon a twig, a chair-bottom, 

 a bit of flannel, or a few dry leaves where she had reposed and affixed 

 her subtile aroma. Even smooth, dean surface^ retaincij her 

 enuuiation after contact with her and lured the male in her absence.

 laveiulor. ditTusod tlirough tlio Ial)()ratory, prevented the floekinj; of 

 males to the wire-jjauze eajie of the female. 



The removal of the antemue of the mal(>s did not settle the question 

 whether these orji;ans were noses. A sick and sore insect cannot he 

 depended upon for the solution of problems. None of the niaimed 

 males liviul mon> than a day or two after the surfj;ical ojieration. 

 Their natural span of life was too short for the recovery of normal 

 health necessary to physiolo}>;ical experimentation. 



In my work upon the antenna of the ant I found that this organ 

 is a compound nose, every segment being a sub-nose capable of 

 discerning a certain odor while insensitive to all other odors.- If 

 the antenme of moths and !)utterHies be constructed on the same 

 plan as are the antenme of the ants, each sul)-nose liaving power 

 to discern a particular oilor, then it may be that certain sj^ecies of 

 moths and butterHies jiossess, while other species lack, the sub-nose 

 that perceives the effluvium of the adolescent female, whose ephemeral 

 existence makes early mating necessary to the continuance of the 

 tribe. 



The result of the elision of the whole of both antennae w^ould not 

 reveal the answer to the question concerning a sub-no.se. Surgery 

 would needs be applied, segment l)y segment, until the sub-nose 

 discerning the female effluvium should V)e discovered through abnor- 

 mal behavior produced by no other cause than the elimination of 

 that particular segment. One species having antennae miglit possess 

 this sub-nose, while another species having antennaj might lack 

 this sub-nose, and in this diflference in the line or series of sul)-noses 

 would lie the cause of unlike behavior in species apparently endowed 

 with similar organs of smell. 



A curious and unexplained instinct in insects generally impels 

 them to deposit their eggs upon substances that are the natural food 

 of the larvge hatched from the eggs. Since the mature insect does 

 not eat the sort of food upon wdiich the larva? subsist and grow, and 

 since the pupa-stage, in some cases continuing many months, inter- 

 venes between the larval period and the emergence in mature form, 

 it seems improbable that memory of the gustatory joys of her own 

 larval existence or an intelligent foresight in provision for her 

 j'oung is what induces the mother insect to deposit her eggs on the 

 nutriment required by the larvai issuing therefrom. The possession 

 of an olfactory organ, a sub-nose discerning the chemical constituents 

 of the nourishment ingested in her own earliest days, may account 

 for the habitual behavior of the insect in choosing to deposit her 

 eggs in a place that will favor the continuance of her tribe. 



The tiny truffle hunting beetle, Balhoccras gaUicus,^ infallibly 

 reaching its sole food by digging a vertical tunnel of from twelve to

fifteen inches from the surface of the ground to its subterranean 

 sustenance, probal)ly has a sub-nose that smells nothing save the 

 fungus whose odor emanates from the sandy soil. 



There is great significance in the fact that sjiiders and scorpions, 

 having no practical use for the sense of smell in their habitual activi- 

 ties, have no antenna^. 



Siimynary. — If moths and butterflies, like certain ants, have a 

 compound nose, then one of the sub-noses guiding the habitual 

 activities of the male insect may function exclusively in tliscerning 

 the odor of the adolescent female. Elision of the whole antennae 

 would then prevent, as it possiblx did in the case of Fabre's Oak 

 Eggers, a return under the allurement offered by the female. 



Cloths and i)utterflies normally lacking such a sub-nose would 

 not be subject to this particular lure, although the antenna} were 

 intact. 



This hypothesis fits the phenomena and explains what has here- 

 tofore been considered mysterious.

FIXATION OF SINGLE TYPE LECTOTYPIC) SPECIMENS OF SPECIES OF 

 AMERICAN ORTHOPTERA. 



DIVISION III. 

 BY ALBERT P. MORSE AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



Species of Xouth Amehicax Outhoi'teka Desckibed 

 UY Albert Pitts Mouse. 



The desirability of selection ami fixation of a sin,u;le tyj^e has been 

 discussed and such work accomplished for a large number of species 

 of North American Orthoptera in the first paper bearing the title 

 here used by James A. G. Rehn and the present junior author.' 

 The species of North American Orthoptera described by A. N. 

 Caudell have l)een treated in similar manner in the second division 

 of the series by their .'sponsor and the present junior author,- and in 

 this paper the .species descril^ed from North America In- the present 

 senior author, whether valid or established synonyms, are similarly 

 treated. 



It has been a rule with the senior author to consider every specimen 

 of the series originally described as a type, but the selection from 

 these of the single type by their author obviates all difficulties which 

 might otherwise have arisen. 



In the present paper, North America is used in its restricted sense, 

 only including that part of the continent north of the Mexican line, 

 as has been done in the other papers of the series, except in particular 

 instances in the first division, where, in order to make certain of the 

 sections complete, it was found necessary to include all of the species 

 described in papers treating of North America .south to the Isthmus 

 of Panama. 



Of the sixty-five units here considered the types of fifty-two are 

 in the Morse Collection,' ten in the ^Museum of Comparative 

 Zoologj' and one each in the American Museum of Natural History, 

 Cornell University and Heljard Collection.

a biological reconnaissance of the okefinokee swamp 

 in georgia. 



Prefatory. 



Durinji the suninicr of 1912 a party of zoologists, all fnr.u Cornell 

 Cnivcrsity. visited the Okcfinokec Swamp in .southeastern Georgia, 

 remaining seven weeks in the early summer (May 28 to July 13). 

 The party consisted of Professors C. K. Crosl)y and J. Chester 

 Bradley, of the Department of Entomology'; Dr. A. II. Wright, of 

 the Department of Zoology; Headma.-^ter W. D. Funkhouser, of the 

 Ithaea High School; Messrs. M. D. Leonard. S. (". Bishop and A. H. 

 Cahn, of the class of 1913, and Paul Battle, of Bainhridge, Ga. 

 Mr. E. L. Wor.sham, State Entomologist of Georgia, and Mr. Charles 

 S. Spooner, Assistant State I-]ntomologist, were with the party for 

 a week. A smaller party liom the same institution spent two 

 weeks in the swamp in December, 1913 (December 18, 1913, to 

 January 1, 1914). This party consisted of Professors James G. 

 Xeedham and J. Chester Bradley, John T. Xe<'dliam and Paul 

 Battle. In addition. Dr. Bradley and Mr. liattle spent a week in 

 the .swamp in September. 1913. and Dr. Bradley had made very 

 l>rief trips into the swamp in the fall of 190:) and the s])ring of 191 1. 



The object of all these expeditions was to study and put on record 

 something of the bitjlogical conditions in this extensive fresh-water 

 swamp, which still jiresents in a large measui-r priinitive ami inter- 

 esting (•on<litions of environment, before they should Itecome t(»revfr 

 <'hanged by the now rapidly penetrating lumbermen. 



Under the above title it is inlinde(l to puiili-li reports upon the 

 various groups coUeetecl, as studied. In due course a general account

Althoii}2;li the Okcfinokoo Swamp represents one of the most 

 interesting regions in tlie southeustern United States for the study 

 of reptilian life, praetie illy no records have been made of this jiart 

 of its fauna. The following i)ai)er is intended as a preliminary 

 eontril)ution toward a knowledge of the herpetology of this area — 

 an area which is sure to prove a rich field for zoological W(jrk when 

 suitable provision has been made to render its interior more accessible. 



Few attempts hav(> l)een made to enter the Okefinokee for scientific 

 purposes. The swamp, in its earlier history, was a centre for beau- 

 tiful Indian legends and mythical tales; in later times, this pathless 

 wilderness occasioned a weird medley of stories, many of which 

 reflect its supposedly dangerous attributes. The miasmatic effect 

 of the "black mud, the stench from which soon became so intoler- 

 able as to induce vomiting," impresses Captain Rodenbough (1838)' 

 as its worst characteristic; while another considers it " very dangerous 

 to the health of man especially to recent arrivals in the country; 

 .... in the Okefinokee mosquitoes sometimes rise in such swarms 

 that the trees are only seen dimly as through a dust-storm." But 

 with natives and travellers alike, a deterrent more powerful than 

 eithei of these l)eliefs are the dreaded reptiles within its borders. 

 Paul Fountain,'- in his A Day in a Cypress Swamp (Okefinokee), 

 devotes practically his entire chapter to these cold-blooded creatures. 

 He says: "A greater number of reptiles may be found in this 

 .swamp than in any other spot I know of in the States," and our 

 experience proves it a veritable paradise for the herpetologist. 



Profes.sor A. M. Ree-e,'' when searching for clues to the breeding 

 habits of the alligator, made a trip to the Okefinokee in the summer 

 of 1905. He .says: 



"In the STimmor of 1000 tho C)kpfinok«'o was apain visitod; this time the; 

 .swamp wa-s j)fnft rated to its ff-ntrc. and nearly one hundred alligators were 

 killwJ by the three hunters with whom I was traveilinj?. It is this v-igorous 

 hunting, done ehiefly at night, with a bull's-eye lantern and shot-gun, that has 

 .so diminLshed the number of alligators, where, twenty years ago, hundreds

could be seen, to-day scarcely one may be found. It seems a very wanton 

 destruction of life to kill so many of these large animals, especially when it is 

 remembered that a large alligator hide is worth to the hunter only about SI. .50." 

 "Just how .soon (if at all) the alligator is likely to be exterminated in our 

 Southern .States it is impossible to say, but so long as those two great swampy 

 wastes, the Everglades and the Okefinokee, remain undrained, the great American 

 reptile is not hkely to become entirely extinct." 



Of this .same form we have the very interesting aceount of Andrew 

 EUicott,^ who served as the United States Commissioner to determine 

 the boundary between Florida and Georgia in 1800. With the 

 Spanish Commissioner, he started up the St. Mary's January 23, 

 and returned March 3; and his mounds "A" and "B" have l)een 

 the subject of many memorials by both Florida and Georgia. He 

 writes : 



"ThLs being the sea.-^nn that the .Vliigators, or .Vmerican crocodiles were be- 

 ginning to crawl out of tin- mud and bask in th<' sun, it was a favorable lime to 

 take them, both on account <jf their t(jrpid state, and to examine the truth of the 

 report of their .swallowing pine knots in the fall of the ye;ir to .serve them, (on 

 account of their diHicult <ligestionj during the term of their torjjor, which is 

 probably about three months. For this purpo.se two .Vlligators of about eight 

 or nine feet in length were taken and opened, and in the stomach of each were 

 found several pine and other knots,' pieces of bark, and in one of them some 

 charcoal; but exclusive of such indigestible matter, the stomachs of both were 

 empty. So far the report ai)pi'ars to be founded in fact ; but wiicthcr these were 

 swallowed on account of their tedious digestion, and therefore proper during the 

 time those animals lay in the mud, or to prevent the collapse of th(! coats of the 

 stomach, or by acciflent owing to their voracious manner of devouring their 

 food, is difficult tr) determine. 



"The Alligator has been so often, and so well described, and tho.-e descriptions 

 arc so well known, that other attempts have become unne"es.sary. It mav 

 nevertheless be proper to remark that so far as the human sjM'cies are concerned, 

 the Alligators a[)pcar much less dangenjus than has generally been supposed, 

 particularly by tho-e unac(]uaiiiled with them. .Viid 1 do not re -oller-t meeting 

 with but one well authentic,ite(l fact of any of the human s|)ecie- being inJMre<l 

 by th«'m in that country, (where they are very numerous,) ami that w:us a negro 

 near New < )rleans, who while standmg in the water sawing a |)ie:'e of timber, had 

 one of his lezs dangerously woundeil by one of ihein. My opinion on this sub- 

 ject is founded on my own exi)erience. I have frecjuently been a witness to 

 In<iians, including men, women and children, bathinu' in rivers and jxinds, where 

 tho.se animals are extremely numerous, without any apjiarent dread or caution: 

 the .same practice was pursued by myself and people, without caution, and 

 without injury. 



"Some of the .Mligators we killed were very fat, and would doubtless liavi- 

 yielded a considerable fpi.-intily of oil, whi<'h is probably almost the only use Ih.il 

 will ever be m.'iile of them; however their tails are fre(|ui'nlly eaten by the Indians 

 and negroes, ami Mr. Howie.. informe<l me that he thought them one of the 

 greatest of delicaci»'s. 



"The Alligators appear to al>oinid plentifully in musk, the smell of which is 

 .sometimes perceptible to a considerable distance, when they are wounded or 

 killed; but whether the musk is cont.ained in a receptacle for that purpose, .and 

 Hecreted by a particular gl.and or gl.iiids, or geni-r.illy <lifTu-ed through the system 

 appears somewh;it \nicert:iin: and 1 confess their .ippearance was so disagreeable

110 PHOCIOKDINCS OF TlIK ACADKM V OF [Mai.^ 



The l)ulk of the material descrilu'd in tiie ])resent paper was 

 obtained hy the expedition from Cornell University during the 

 Munmer of 1912, at whieh time the swamp was entered from the 

 southwestern side and a permanent camp estahlisiied on Billy's 

 Island, located in the centre of the swamp. From this camp 

 sitie trips were made from time to time throufj;hout the summer, 

 and a fairly accurate idea of the S('op;raphy and l)i()lo<2;y of the rc.uion 

 was obtained. 



Most valuable services were rendered to this party by the Lee 

 family, living on Billy's Island, the only human inhabitants of the 

 interior of the swamp, and practically out of touch with the outside 

 world. Their primitive mode of living had adapted them to a 

 marvellous degree to the appreciation of the wild life about them, 

 and their observations and knowledge of natural phenomena proved 

 to be surprisingly accurate. The older men and boys ware indis- 

 pensable as guides while the party was in the swamp, and on the 

 exit of the party a container was left with them to be filled with 

 specimens which might come to their hands later in the year. This 

 container, full of material chosen with evident care and good judg- 

 ment, was received November 15, 1912, and the specimens thus 

 secured proved a valuable addition to those previously collected. 

 In December, 1913, data were obtained on the ^^^nter condition of 

 some of the forms here noted. 



The list of species here described is of course hardly more tiian 

 a check-list of those reptiles noted during the two months which 

 the party spent in the Okefinokee, and is no doubt very incomplete 

 as regards the extent of the reptilian fauna of the swamj), but it is 

 hoped that it will serve as a basis for future work and as an aid to 

 systematic zoologists interested in the forms of the region under 

 discussion.

1. Macroclemmys temminckii Troost. Plate I, fig. 3. 



The alligator snapper, called by the natives "gator terrapin" 

 or "loggerhead," was reported as being common in the Okcfinokee, 

 but very few specimens were seen by our party. No adults were 

 collected. The presence of the alligator snapper in the Okcfinokee 

 carries its range eastward to the easternmost Gulf tributary (the 

 Suwannee) and the former eastern boundary of oltl West Florida. 

 Its association here with Chelydra serpentina suggests that the latter 

 may have Ijeen an Atlantic coast contribution through the St. Mary's. 



This turtle is said to attain a large size in its natural habitat in 

 the lakes of this region, and some evidence was secured to bear out 

 this statement. A specimen about eight inches in length was cap- 

 tured June 17 anil placed in a "bee-gum" for safekeeping. On 

 the return to the spot the next day, the turtle had escaped. Dave 

 Lee stated that he had seen turtles with the head alone as large as 

 the shell of this specimen. A skull of Macroclemmys temminckii 

 with the lower mandible missing was found on one of the islands, 

 and it proved by its measurements that this turtle api)r(Kiches such 

 a size. This skull, old and iiiucli weathered, agrees exactly with 

 Boulengcr's figure*^ in the arrangement of bones and sutures and in 

 the position of the fossa?. It measures as follows: 



Maximum length (S\ inches, maximum width (i inche-;, width 

 between centres of orbital sockets 2h inches, diameter of (jrbit 1 

 inch, distance from eye to snout (between openings) 1 inch, height 

 of upper mandible at anterior hook 2 inches, maximum width of 

 upper mandible fat posterior angle) 1 inches, width of na-ai opening 

 1 inch. 



In connection with this data, a large scale, pr<)bal)ly from the 

 shell of an "alligator snapf)er," was found in the swimming hole at 

 the boat landing on Hilly's Island, June 9. 1912. This seuie is flat, 

 thin, hard and fan-shaped; on the upper surface eight radiating 

 longitudinal ridges and numerous close, concentric, sultp.iraliel 

 transverse grooves, the under surface smooth and slightly undulating. 

 The .scale is dry and brittle, much weathereil and inciinecl to peel 

 on the upper surface and is the cephalic .scale of one of the costal 

 series. Maxinnun length o.^ inches, maxinuun width o^ inches, 

 slightly broken on on«' sicU; at distal angle. 



No eggs of this turtle were collected.

".' Chelydra serpentina (Linnapus). Plato I, Br. ;"i; II, fig. 5. 



Two young snapping turtles were brought out of the swamp and 

 at thi^ tune were not carefully exaniined, hut were supj)()se(l to he 

 young of the alligator snapper. ()u comparison with similar-sized 

 representatives of Chelydra serpentina taken at Ithaca, N. Y., they 

 prove to he identical with the northern specimens. They are without 

 the scallopetl anterior margin of M. U'tnininckii young, as represented 

 by Agassiz' and do not possess the striking papilhc of the young 

 of the alligator snapper. The orl)its are directed outwards and 

 upwards as in ('. serpentina and wholly unlike the condition in the 

 large skull of M. temminckii secured in the swamp. Furthermore, 

 no supramarginals api)ear in the carapace. The specimens are 

 small, the larger having a shell 1| inches long by 1| inches wide. 

 A brief description may be given as follows : 



Carapace grayish-black; very rough; three distinct ridges, the 

 central highest ; vertebral plates distinctly serrate at edges, inclined 

 to overlap, each plate roughly bifid posteriorly; marginal plates 

 thick, narrow, edges smooth anteriorly, strongly toothed posteriorly. 

 Plastron acute posteriorly; black with white marginal markings. 

 Head gray, skin tuberculate, white spot below angle of mandible 

 on each side. Neck black, skin loose and wrinkled. Legs black, 

 unmarked. Skin of head, neck, legs and under surface of body 

 gray or black, rough and finely tuberculate. Tail long, l)lack, 

 spiny above, smooth below, gradually narrowing to apex. 

 3. Cinosteronm pennsylvanicum Bosc Plate II, fig. 3. 



It is one of the common turtles of the swamp, found both on land 

 and in the water. These turtles were often seen in the shallower 

 waters of the lakes and in the ponds on the islands and frequently 

 on the higher portions of the wooded areas where they came to 

 deposit their eggs. 



The .specimens collected showed practically no variation in struc- 

 ture or coloration, and the adult as represented in the Okefinokee 

 fauna may be briefly described as follows: 



Carapace smooth and comparatively high; uniform dark brown 

 in color without markings, but occasionally with fine obsolete indented 

 lines; marginal plates narrow, brown above and reddish-yellow 

 below with brown markings on under side; both extremities of 

 carapace obtusely rounded. Plastron loosely hinged, not com- 

 pletely covering fleshy parts, especially pp.steriorly, deeply notched

behind; reddi:?h-yellow, with deep brown rectangular grooves at 

 inner and posterior edges of plates; interstices between hinges, and 

 sutures between plates wide. Xeck long; skin loose and much 

 wrinkled; black aliove, sordid white beneath. Head comparatively 

 large; black or brown above, occasionally spotted witli yellow or 

 greenish-yellow on sides, uniform white or yellow beneath; ui">per 

 mandible with strong curved blunt hook. Legs unmarked, brown- 

 black; claws long, strong and sharp. Tail thiclv and suddenly 

 acuminate at extremity. Average length of carapace 3| inches, 

 width 2j inches; plastron 3} inches in length by 2 inches in width; 

 height of shell 1| inches; width of head | inch. 



The time during which the sjiecimens were collected (May and 

 June) seemed to be the egg-laying season. A fine large female 

 (C. U., No. 6,456) was taken on the nest in the act of egg-laying, 

 Juno 11, 1912, and three eggs were found with the specimen. The 

 nest was in rotten wood by the side of a dead log and the eggs were 

 deposited at a depth of three inches below the surface of the decayed 

 Avood. In the stomach of a king snake (Ophibolus gctidus) (C I'., 

 Xo. 6,138) taken on Billy's Island, June 11, 1912, was found one 

 egg of Cinostertium pennsylvanicum, together with two eggs of 

 Chrtj.sctnijs JlorifJfind. Another king snake (C. U., Xo. 0,146) taken 

 on Billy's Island had what was apinirently the shells of Cinosternum 

 eggs in its stomach, and a third snake of the same species also taken 

 on Billy's Island had in its stomach a large nvmiber of crushed and 

 finely broken shells of the same kind of egt^s. Finally', Mr. Harper 

 relates how he and Dave Lee stuiiil)l( d ui)i»ii a king snake, and w Inn 

 they had recovered they found a small ( 'inosternum digging in the 

 sand — all of which seems strong circumslantial evidence to pr<tve 

 the snake was on hand to scoop the eggs the instant they were Laid. 

 Tlu'se turtles, therefore, evidently come up to the woody parts of 

 the islands during this season to deposit th<'ir eggs, which often 

 furnish food for the snakes and. according to the Lees, also for other 

 animals of the swamp. 



.\ numl)er of the eggs of this turtle were colleetecl, but owing to 

 the evaporation of the liipiid from the contaiiieivs in which they 

 were placed, none were preserved in a c<indition satisfactory for 

 accurate description or measurements. The eggs wen- elli|)tic;d. 

 approximately 30 nun. long by 15 luni. in diameter and ol a pinki-h- 

 white color. The shells seem to be slightly more l)rittle .md appar- 

 ently less gramilar than those of ('hri/acfnys Jloridana.

« Sternothcerus carinatus (CJray). 



Two spociincns of musk turtles, agrccinii; witli cacli oilier in cvcry

 Tlu>s(' speounon>< roj^rosent an interesting form of »S'. carinatus. They 

 difi'er from the normal in that the distinct black spots of the head 

 are very obsolete and the l)lack streaks or spots of the carapace, 

 usually so prominent, are almost absent or only faintly visible. 

 The gular shield is very small, a raised boss or knob. 



The carapace is very rough, the vertebral plates sharp and inclined 

 to overlap; dark bro\m in color, rubljed off to sordid yellow in 

 spots; characteristic markings of carapace faint; both extremities 

 of carapace obtusely rounded and slightly serrate, upper surface 

 <listinctly three ridged with central carina prominent; plastron 

 almost solid, very narrow posteriorly and weakly notched behind; 

 uniform yellow in color. Head dark brown with obsolete black 

 spots, no lines aliove or below eyes; snout tapering and conical; 

 under jaw with longitudinal black stripes. Legs uniform black; feet 

 l)roadly webbed; claws thin and sharp. Tail thick and suddenly 

 acuminate at apex. The larger specimen measures as follows: 

 Length of carapace 3| inches, width 2| inches; length of plastron, 

 2| inches, maximum width 2 inches; height of shell 1| inches; 

 width of head I inch. 



No eggs or young of this turtle were collected and no data were 

 secured as to its habits or life history. 



o- Chrysemys floridana LeConte. Plate II, fig. 4 ; III, fig. 6. 



This is pnjbaljly the commonest turtle on the islands of the swamp. 

 They were often seen on the sandy banks where they came to deposit 

 their eggs, or found sunning themselves on the logs in the lakes 

 and crossways or in the smaller cypress ponds on the islands. These 

 turtles were active and hard to approach, unless taken with great 

 caution from the rear, but were numerous and often observed. 

 They were very common about the Lees' clearing, where not infre- 

 quently the eggs were plowed up, and were also found on Mixon's 

 Hanmiock in a cleared sandy portion just we.st of a prominent 

 Indian mound. About the Lees' clearing the dogs often discovered 

 these turtles and by barking attracted the attention of members 

 of the party. The dogs in the same way were constantly surprising 

 the turtles on the hammocky edges of the island as the reptiles were 

 returning to the water after laying their eggs. In endeavoring to 

 arrest the progress of the turtles, the dogs usually had recourse to 

 claws and teeth, and many of the specimens secured show deep 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



scratches on the shell which are no doubt evidences of such en- 

 counters. 



Thirteen adults, four young; and a large numl)er of eggs were 

 brought out of the swamp and numbers were collected which were 

 not preserved. The month tluring which most of the specimens 

 were taken (June) seemed to be the egg-laying season. The eggs, 

 usually numbering from twelve to twenty, were found in the sand. 

 One female killed for soup, June 4, 1912, contaiiied sixteen eggs 

 read}' for depositing. A bear, killed May 30, had in its stomach 

 twelve eggs, one of which was whole, and signs wer(^ ]:)lentiful to 

 pnjvc that the bears dug these eggs from the sand. When an egg 

 complement was found exposed or only partly coveretl by the sand, 

 or with the complement very small, the natives asserted that the 

 turtle had been disturijed in the midst of egg-laying by the attack 

 of bears or had been frightened from the eggs by these animals.^ 

 A king snake (Of)hlbolu.s (jetulu.s gctulus, C. U., No. 6,147), captured 

 June 26, 1912, had fourteen eggs in its stomach. Another king 

 snake fC. V., No. 6,140), taken June 3, had thirteen eggs in its 

 stomach. The stomachs of three other specimens of the same 

 species of .snake contained, respectively, one, two, and six eggs of 

 Chrysemys florirhina. It seems very likely that other snakes and 

 perhaps other mannnals, such as coons, find the eggs of this turtle 

 a palatable article of diet. The eggs were also eaten by the Lees, 

 and those eggs which were immature and secured before fertiliza- 

 tion had taken place were pronounced by members of our party 

 exc€*llent eating; the older eggs seemed bitter. 



The natives called this turtle the "cooter, " and it was also locally 

 known as the "hard-back cooter." 



The specimens taken showed little variation in structure or mark- 

 ings. Most of th(jse caj)tured were females with decidedly convex 

 plastron. The size of the shells of the mature specimens averaged 

 about 1 foot in length by 11 inches in width and 5 inches in height. 

 The largest specimen taken (No. O.ii^iij measured as follows: Length 

 of carapace \'-V, inches, width 12 inches; length of i)la-^tron 1 1 ', inches, 

 width 6i inches; height of shell 5\ inches. The adult of Cliryscmys 

 Jloridnna, as found in the Okehnokee, may Ik* described as follows: 



Carapace very high ami dome-shaped; black-brown; vertebral 

 plates smooth except anterior and posterior one^ which are slightly

thrco-fourtlis, lower fourth witli transverse ridges; inarj2;iiial ])latcs 

 smooth or lightly longitiulinally rugose, the posterior sonietimes 

 slightly serrate at joints; vertebral plates marked with heavy 

 longitudinal yeJlow line on eaeh side of middle with fainter eross- 

 lines of same color; costal plates with broad median yellow 

 line extending outwafd, often bifurcate at distal end and some- 

 times surrounded with hieroglyphics of wavy lines of the same 

 color; marginal plates with distinct metlian yellow band extending 

 outward, rarely fainter bands on each side. Plastron uniform 

 lemon-yellow, convex anteriorly, deeply notched posteriorly; edge 

 of marginal plates with black spots beneath, varying in number, but 

 usually five on each side. Head very small; eyes large; head and 

 neck striped with yellow; median longitudinal bifurcated yellow- 

 white line on undersitle of head, sometimes with white line inside 

 bifurcation and yellow line on either side. Legs and feet deep 

 brown-black marked with yellow stripes. Claws very long, the 

 middle three of the anterior limb longest. 



One specimen was taken in which the median stripe of the mar- 

 ginal plates was decorated on each side with a semicircular line 

 followed by a short bar, thus agreeing with Holbrook's figure.^ 



The young specimens collected lacked the high, dome-like carapace 

 of the adults. The shells were almost round and about 1^ inches 

 in diameter. 



Description. — Carapace slate-colored, averaging three-fourths of 

 an inch in height and abruptly keeled in the middle. Costal plates 

 smooth with distinct median w'hite line sometimes liordered by 

 faint wavy lines of the same color. Marginal plates smooth, edges 

 serrate at joints, decorated with median white line followed on each 

 side by semicircular white line and white dot. Plastron clear light 

 yellow. Under surface of marginal plates with line of black dots 

 extending entirely around the shell. Middle three claws of anterior 

 limb not verj' long, as in adults. 



From the specimens examined it would appear that the young and 

 immature forms are likely to show the markings of the carapace, 

 the decorated marginal plates and the black spots of the under 

 margin of the marginal plates more distinctly than the larger forms. 



The eggs collected were uniform in size, shape and color. Shape 

 ovate-elliptical, color pinkish-white, surface slightly granular, shells 

 quite soft. Of 103 eggs measured, the average length proved to be

34.16 mm., and the average diameter 24.15 mm.; tlie mode 35 x 24 

 mm.; the maximum length 40.5 mm., and the maxinmm diameter 

 27 mm.; the minimum length 33 mm., and the minimum diameter 

 22 mm. 

 6. Chrysemys reticulatus Bosc. 



Three specimens of Chrysemys reticulatus were secured in the 

 Okefinokee, two on Billy's Island and one on Honey Island. The 

 field notes of members of the part}' do not record any others as 

 ha\ing been seen, and it is probable that this is one of the less common 

 turtles of the swamp. The specimens secured agree with the pub- 

 lished descriptions and there can be little doubt as to the identitj' 

 of the species. 



The largest specimen, which is probably most typical in all re- 

 spects save the markings, may be described briefly as follows: 



Carapace dull brown; thickly covered with fine reticulated grooves; 

 each plate with a distinct flat marginal border; shell rather high, 

 smooth in general outline; marginal i)lates with obsolete median 

 yellow line; under side of each marginal plate with black spot, 

 sometimes coalesced with that of the neighboring plate. Plastron 

 smooth, reddish-yellow, median plates with a distinct tinge of red. 

 Neck verj' long, skin loose, black. Head brown above with faint 

 yellow markings; yellow beneatli with distinct reticulated brown 

 lines. Fore legs with wide yellow band in front, yellow below; 

 feet black beneath; claws long. Under surface of hind legs and 

 tail yellow; hind legs with alternate black and yelU)W lines pos- 

 teriorly; tail with two i>lack lines on und(!r side. Measurements: 

 Length of carapace 85 inches, width 7 inches; length of plastron 

 6] inches, width 4 inches; height of shell 3\ inches; width of head 

 Ij'jf inches; interorbital space less than J U)ng diameter of the eye; 

 orbits distinctly upwards and outwards in direction. 



The second specimen dilTers from the first only in size, in having 

 the earapace .somewhat indented an<l in the darker colors antl less 

 conspicuous markings. In this specimen the lines on the under 

 .side of the head are more nearly parallel, and the yellow color less 

 evident on the legs. The und«'r sid(; of the marginals would be 

 wholly without black spots but for three very indistinct ones. The 

 two spots on th(' bridge are widely separated. 



Tin* smalh'st of the three specimens was fouml on Honey Island 

 and differs from the others only in the markings of the carapace 

 and in the more brilliant <-olors of the body. The carapiice of this 

 specimen is smooth, without grooves, and beautifully decorated with 




118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



brifiht yellow, narrow reticulated lines covering the vertebral and 

 costal i>lates; th(> niarfjinal jilates have a distinct median yellow 

 hand, in some instances this is connected with reticulate lines of 

 vertebral and costal jilatcs. The j^lastron is clear lemon-yellow 

 witli black band at extreme outer edf«;e of abdominal and pix'toral 

 jilates anil on the axillary and inj^uinal plates. There is no variation 

 in the pattern of the markings from that of the older and larger 

 specimens, but the colors are much more (>vi(l(>nt. 



No data wcm'c obtained as to the life history or the habits of this 

 species. 



7. Terrapene Carolina Linn. 



One specimen of Terrapene Carolina was tak(ui on Honey Island, 

 June 2, 1912. The natives of the swamp call all box turtles "lock- 

 ups," and report that they are comparatively numerous, but only 

 two specimens were collected during the time our party was in the 

 swamp, one Terrapene Carolina antl one Terrapene major. 



The specimen of Terrapene Carolina taken measured 65 inches in 

 length, with a plastron (completely closed) 5y inches long; the total 

 height of the shell 2| inches. Carapace dome-shai)e(l, higher l)ehind 

 than in front, smooth as to general surface but with slight indenta- 

 tions on the middle verte])ral plates; entirely covered with irregular 

 dark yellow spots recalling Ditmar's comparison'*' of having been 

 spotted with a brush. At the external margin of the costal plates 

 a few irregular yellow lines extend outward. The shell shows no 

 keel and the marginal plates are not flared. The edges of the mar- 

 ginal plates are yellow and the under side of the same plates marked 

 with brown posteriorly. Plastron uniform yellow, interstices 

 between plates brownish. 



No eggs or young of this turtle were found and no data obtained 

 as to its life history. The Lees stated that box turtles were very 

 common in "The Pocket," but no opportunity offered for the inves- 

 tigation of this statement. 



S. Terrapene major AKassiz. 



One small specimen of Terrapene major, measuring 6| inches in 

 length, was taken from "The Pocket" on June 20, 1912. 



This species may be distinguished from Terrapene Carolina, the 

 only other l)ox turtle taken in the swamp, by the flaring posterior 

 marginal plates, the blunt keel behind, the bright yellow median

line extending the entire length of the carapaee, and the groups of 

 radiating yellow lines marking the costal plates. 



The carapace is chocolate-brown in color with characteristic 

 radiating yellow lines on the upper surface of the costal plates and 

 suhparallel yellow bands extending outward on the external margins; 

 each plate is marked with regular concentric subrectangular grooves. 

 Plastron (closed) Sf inches in length and 3 J inch(\s in width; uniform 

 yellow in color with a re(Ulish-l)rown spot on the external posterior 

 angle of each plate; all jilates showing parallel grooves along the 

 median line, and in the case of the abdominal plates these grooves 

 make a right angle at the median anterior corner of the plate anil 

 extend laterad reaching the margin. Under side of marginal plates 

 yellow with irregular markings of Iwcnvn. 



In the one specimen tak«'n, the jio^tcrior end of the shell is some- 

 what mutilated. 

 y. Platypeltis feroz Schw<iK«er. PhiH' 1, in,'-', i, :.'. .H; II, fin. >>. 



This sjx-cies is common throughout the swamp. Adults, young 

 and eggs were collected, and the field notes show tluit this turtle 

 was recorded from Billy'- Island, Honey Island, Floyd's Island. 

 Mixon's Hammock, Billy's Lake, Minne Lake and Sweet Water. 

 This species is doubtless to be found in all parts of the Okefinokee, 

 and is especially abundant in those places where the water is deep 

 and the bottom soft. The natives claim that soft-shelled turtles 

 are to l)e found wherever there are alligators, and this fact .seems 

 to be borne out by the observations made on these turtles. On 

 May M, 1912, an attempt was nuide to seine a " 'gator hole" on the 

 Honey Island Prairies. Before seining, Bryant Lee went over the 

 hole "grunting," a method locally used to start the alligators, which 

 animals, it is claimed, will re<pond to this peculiar vocal accoMipli-li- 

 ineut and sIhiw their |)re<encc by rows of bubble- oil the surface b\- 

 which they nuiy be followed. In this instance the sup|)osed alligator 

 was jiursued for some distance, only to prove to be a large rhihijxllis. 

 It is not improbable that the deep, secluded "'gator holes" may 

 furnisii a favore»| retreat f(»r this turtle whose ability to debnd 

 itself by its jMiwerful mandibles and snake-like bite is well known 

 and may be sufficient iirotection against tlu' alligator itself. Accord- 

 ing to tlu; Lee-, this turtle is very active an<l can u-f- its legs to a 

 remarkable degree, especially while in the water, and plenty «)t 

 evidence was secured to show that its legs and knife-edged beak wen- 

 no mean weapons. .\ captured specimen, a foot or more^in length,

 practically its own length. 



On account of the size and weight of tiiis turtle, it was impracti- 

 cable to carry a large series out of the Okefinokee with the limited 

 means of conveycnce afforded to the expedition, but sufficient data 

 were secureil from the large number of specimens observed to give a 

 fairly accurate account of their appearance, habits and life history. 

 A numl)er of heads, skulls, carapaces, young turtles and eggs, both 

 mature and embryonic, were collected and brought out of the swamp, 

 and notes were made on the adults in their native environment. 



The adult turtle may be described as follows from an average 

 specimen taken June 12, 1912, on Billy's Island, and preserved as 

 C. v., No. 6,471. 



Carapace chocolate-colored with obsolete irregular patches of 

 black; strongly tuberculate at anterior end, with faint, subparallel, 

 longitudinal rows of tubercles extending the entire length of the 

 vertebral and costal regions of the carapace and becoming more 

 prominent and pronounced at the posterior end; marginal area soft 

 and flabby, especially at posterior half. Plastron smooth, yellowish- 

 white, extending well forward and somewhat exceeding the carapace, 

 almost entirely covering the fleshy parts anteriorly, narrower behind 

 and leaving much of the posterior part of the body exposed. Head 

 comparatively small, smooth, bro^vn, markings very faint; snout 

 developed into a long fleshy proboscis; lips fleshy. Tail thick; 

 vent close to end; extremity of tail suddenly acuminate beyond 

 vent. Measurements: Carapace 15| inches long, 11 inches wide; 

 plastron 11^ inches long, 10 inches wide; height of shell 5 inches; 

 width of head 2^ inches. 



The heads were cut off from some of the larger specimens and 

 preserved when it was impossible to carry the entire turtle. 



Such a head, representing one of the largest of the turtles cap- 

 tured (Xo. 6,473), measures Sh inches in maximum width, 2 inches 

 in height, ^ inch between eyes, 3 inches from snout to angle of mandi- 

 ble, and shows a proboscis I inch in length. The head is brown 

 above, with white on snout, below the eyes and at edges of mandibles, 

 and yellowish-white on the entire under side. The eyes are small 

 and, as will be noticed from the measurements, near together. The 

 head is strongly tapering and the opening of the mouth well inferior. 

 The lips are fleshy with loose skin and the jaws large and strong. 

 This head was from a large female taken June 22, 1912, which con- 

 tained 49 embrj^onic eggs in an advanced stage of development.

The complete skull of a soft-shelled turtle, with cartilages of 

 mandibles still attached, was found on Billy's Island, June 10, 1912. 

 This skull agrees with Boulenger's short description" and in all 

 general features with Hegner's figure,'- and, while much weathered, 

 shows the bones and sutures in excellent shape. It is remarkable 

 for the high supraoccipital ridge (the two sfjuamosal ridges being 

 damaged) and for the very flat temporal region. 



This skull measures 3f inches in length, 2^ inches in width, \ inch 

 between eyes, diameter of sockets f inch, distance from orbital to 

 nasal opening ^ inch, length of lower mandible 2] inches, width of 

 lower mandible at posterior angle 2\ inches, height of lower mandible 

 at middle h inch, distance between orbit and auditory cavity f inch, 

 distance from orl)it to margin of upper mandi))le 2" inch, maximum 

 height of head, including both mandibles, If inches. 



Several carapaces of PlatijpeUis ferox, much weathered and usually 

 more or less mutilateil at the edges, were found on Billy's Island. 



Such a carapace shows the upper surface white and finely reticulate, 

 with pits prominent and the sutures distinct. Nine neural plates 

 are present, the anterior very broad and without corresponding 

 co-stals on either side {i.e., is a nuchal); in form rectangular, about 

 twice as long as wide. Seven costal plates on each side, parallel 

 and regular, and extending transversely across the carapace. The 

 marginal area appears brown and leathery, th(> i)lates fused. The 

 under surface of the carapace is smooth and yellow-white. The 

 ribs are prominent and imbedded in the plates of the carai)a<'e; 

 eight on each side, extending more or less radiately from the verte- 

 bral column. This column is likewise fused with the carapace and 

 presents nine vertebra;. One carapace with nine neural plates had 

 eight, not seven, pairs of costal jilates, the last two pairs meeting 

 on the median line where the neurals are aljsent. These carapaces 

 are al)out \) inches in length. S inclu's in Ijre.'idlli and 2 inches in 

 height. 



.V good series of young soft-shelhMl turtle^ were collected in the 

 swamp and preserved. These range in size from ll to 'Al inches in 

 length and show plainly the brilliant, characteristic markings of the 

 carapace, especially when the shells are wet. The smallest specimen- 

 agree well with Ditmar's figure.'^ 



The carapace is gray-black, strongly marked uitli irnuidarly

plaoetl round black sjiots. W'rtc'bral and costal regions finely, 

 longitudinally rugose with broken lines of linear tubercles; anterior 

 tubercles very small. The marginal area smooth, brown and broadly 

 edged with white. Plastron soft, slate-colored, a white spot on 

 each side of the median line; plastron extends far forward, exceeding 

 the carapace anteriorly, short behind, hniving jiosterior fleshy parts 

 exposed. Head, neck and under parts of body black. Neck long, 

 skin loose and much wrinkled. 8nout long, white beneath, white 

 spot at base of snout with white line from tliis spot to each eye, and 

 white line at edge of mandibles. 



As the specimens become older, the gayly colored markings of the 

 carapace l)ecome less distinct and have disappeared on turtles which 

 have attained a length of 6 inches. The anterior tubercles of the 

 shell become better developed and the whole carapace rougher. 

 The plastron grows lighter in color and the head uniformly darker, 

 with the markings obsolete. A small specimen of a young soft- 

 shelled turtle was found in the stomach of a water moccasin (A?icistro- 

 (lon piscivorus, No. 6,214) taken late in the summer. Very likely, 

 while in this soft-shelled, fleshy state, these turtles furnish an accept- 

 able addition to the food of the larger snakes and perhaps to other 

 animals of the swamp. 



Eggs of Platypeltis ferox were easily secured. They were usually 

 found in the sandy fields and occasionally the turtles were captured 

 at the places of oviposition. The eggs were generally deposited in 

 two or three inches of sand in some place where the surface of the 

 earth was warmed by the direct rays of the sun. One comi)leni( nt 

 of twenty-two eggs was discovered, June 26, on Floyd's Island in 

 which the eggs were uncovered. This was probably due, however, 

 to the fact that the turtle had been in some manner frightened 

 before the egg-laying process was completed. The eggs are almost 

 exactly spherical, averaging 31 mm. in diameter, almost white, 

 somewhat brittle, surface slightly granular and shells very thin. A 

 number of complements of embryonic eggs at various stages of 

 development were taken from turtles and brought out for study. 

 These eggs are bright orange colored, becoming lighter as they 

 mature, and are practically spherical. They vary in size from 

 15 mm. to 32 mm. in diameter, with soft, indented skins, smooth 

 and fragile. In one specimen of Platypeltis (No. 6,484) were found 

 twenty eggs grarluating from very small bright orange ovules to one 

 fully developed white egg 31 mm. in diameter, seemingly ready for 

 depositing.

According to the data secured, it would appear that the egg- 

 laying season for this turtle is represented by the months of June 

 and July. The young turtles feed on fish and frogs, and according 

 to the natives the larger specimens devour also such water fowl as 

 are unfortunate enough to be taken unaware by these reptiles. They 

 frequent the deepest parts of the streams and lakes, but come out 

 to the sandy portions of the islands to deposit their eggs. They 

 are vicious, active, and are among the largest of the Reptilia of the 

 Okefinokee. 



Lacertilia. 



10 Anolis carolinensis Cuvier. 



Common throughout the higher portions of the swamp. Most 

 common on the islands, l)ut seen also on l)ushes in the swamp jiroper. 

 Recorded on Billy's Island, Gallberry Island, "The Pocket," Honey 

 Island, Mixon's Hammock, Minne Lake Islands, in the crossway 

 between Billy's Island and Gallberry Island and on the trail from 

 Billy's Island to AJinne Lake Islands. P'ound chiefly on large 

 bushes and small deciduous trees, where it dodged around the limbs 

 at the approach of the collector. This species is quite active and 

 adept at climbing. 



The Okefinokee .><pecimens are practically uniform in size and 

 structure. Several of the specimens had suffered the loss of part 

 of the tail, but the measurements of body parts showed little varia- 

 tion. The average length of the body to vent was 50 mm., and of 

 the tail about DO mm. In life the usual color of the dorsal surface 

 of the body and tail was light green; the ventral surface almost 

 white, except the belly, which was blue or bluish. The alcoholic 

 specimens show the dorsal colors ranging from slate-gray to dark 

 blue-green, with the ventral surface of the head, throat, and breast 

 showing shades of pink with minute dark spots in longitudinal rows, 

 and the throat often having a loose reddish fold. The belly ranges 

 through various shades of gray and blue, with the vent and uniler 

 surface of the hind legs lighter. The tail is uniformly blue-green 

 Ik'Iow. 



The .scale and plate arrangement proved to be practically constant. 

 The dorsal head ridges in the smaller specimens were .sometimes 

 more or less indistinct, but generally showed 11 to 15 plates. The 

 ainthu.s roslnilis uniformly consisted of six plates; the upper labials 

 of 10 to 12; the lower labials of 11 to bi.

developed and prominent. The rostral plate is very broad. The 

 lower jaw has no median symphyseal plate, the first infralal)ials of 

 the two sides meeting on the median line. 



No data were seeured whieh would give any int'oriiiatioii regarding 

 the breetliug habits of the speeies in the swam]). 



On Deeember 22; 1914, Dr. Bradley found a small, shriveled 

 speeim(>n of Anolis coroUnensis in a pitcher plant. From a botanical 

 standpoint, it would be interesting to know whether tliis plant is 

 able to capture forms as large as this lizard. 



Incidently it may be noted that this was the only lizard seen by 

 Dr. Bradley on this trip, and it would appear that the lizards are 

 not commonly out at this season of the year. 



11. Sceloporus undulatus I.atrielle. Figs. 1, 2. 



Abundant throughout the higlier and drier portion of the Okefinokee 

 and called by the natives "scaly lizard." Most common on the 

 sandy pine lands, where they seem to prefer the fallen timber, logs 

 and stumps, antl always to be found around fences and piles of cut 

 wood, ^'ery active and, like many of the other lizards, difficult to 

 secure without the loss of some portion of the tail. 



The specimens taken proved to be fairly uniform in size, the 

 largest measuring 155 mm. in total length and the smallest 122 mm. 

 In the comparative measurements the figures show a pronounced 

 agreement. The length to vent is slightly less than one-half the 

 total length; the length of the fore leg almost exactly equal to the 

 distance from the anterior end of the head to the axilla; the hind 

 foot about one-half the length of the hind leg, and the width of the 

 head about equal to the length of the fore foot. 



The colors are somewhat variable. The dorsal surface is usually 

 grayish-black, sometimes a brilliant black. The undulating cross- 

 bands are often very faint or obsolete; when distinct they are gen- 

 erally 10 or 11 in number with the white markings prominent. The 

 ventral surface of the bodj- is yellowish-white with numerous dark 

 spots in more or less regular rows. Down the median ventral line 

 these spots run together to form a longitudinal stripe, which in all of 

 the specimens from the swamp is quite i)rominent. Superimposed 

 on the spotted gray-white body color may be found patches of black 

 or blue, the latter usually on the throat and sides of the belly. Occa- 

 sionally the throat shows on each side a brilliant light l)Iue. In a 

 few specimens the ventral surface of the head and Ijclly appears 

 brilliant h)lack. The breast and pelvic region is almost invariably 

 sordid yellow-white with the characteristic dark spots. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 125 



The femoral pores are always present, ranging in nuniljcr from 

 thirteen to fifteen, and sometimes very prominent on the summit 

 of a high ridge. 



The plates of the head are clearly defined and easily distinguished, 

 but in some regions most irregular and complicated in arrangement. 

 The specimens usually show five supraorbitals (in three cases six) 

 separated from the median plates of the head by a single row of 

 small scales and bordered externally by two or three rows of super- 

 ciliaries. The usual arrangement of these superciliaries is in two 

 irregular rows with occa-^ionally one or two plates of a third row. 

 The labial plates appear \ery uniform, the superior row containing 

 five plates and the inferior six. In one or two of the larger specimens 

 this was increased to 0-7. 



The plates of the median dorsal region of the head, however, 

 present a most interesting variation. It is of interest to note that 

 no two of the specimens taken were alike as to the number and 

 arrangement of the plates of this region, altliough all were collected 

 in the same locality within a jjeriod of one month. A discussion 

 of these plates is rendered difficult by the fact that the descriptions 

 l»y various authors differ widely in terminology, and it is not easy 

 to determine upon consistent names for the series of jilates which 

 may be found. The occipital is large and polygonal and sometimes 

 .subdivided (Nos, 6,408, 6,414, 6,415). It contains the i)ineal eye, 

 which is always present. This jilate is bordered by a row of smaller 

 plates ranging in numlier from four to seven (cf. Xos. 6,413, 6,417 

 and 6,418). Anterior to the occipital in a small single plate, some- 

 times adjacent (Xo. 0,410) and sometimes separated by the two 

 anterior i)lates of the l)ordering row (Xo. (),411). The next i)late 

 anteriorly is a large pentagonal or hexagonal i)late slightly anterior 

 to the middle of the eye. The next row may consist of two or of 

 three j)lates. If of three, the middle one is small (cf. Xos. 0,402, 

 0,400 and O.lbi). The next plate is large and may be subdivided 

 to form ati irregular transverse row. The single condition is shown 

 in Xos. 0,405, 0,100. 0.107, 414 and 0,415; the subdivid(!d con- 

 dition in Xos. 6,40".) and 0.112. Anterior to this |)late, and between 

 it and the internasals, there n»ay or may not ajipear a row of plates 

 (when i)resent usually three), more or less regular and usually [pentag- 

 onal. This row is shown in Xos. 6,405, 6,406, 6,407, 0.115. 0.117 

 and 6,418. The two internasals are comparatively large, very irregu- 

 lar in shape and seldom Ijilaterally .synunetrical. They are almost 

 directly above the nostrils. They may be subdivided (Xo* 6,410),

 Between the internasals and the rostrum appear two i^iate.s, usually 

 unsymmetrical, and apparently twisted out of position. Their 

 longest diameter maj' l)e transverse (No. 0,412) or longitudinal 

 (Xo. 6,413), and there is sometimes found a third plate in the row 

 (Xo. 0,409).

.so confusing in arrangement, and so lial^le to subdivision, it might 

 be pointed out tliat the series of rows is comparatively uniform. 

 The hypothetical arrangement of the most simple condition might 

 be represented by the figun; (fig, 2), and from this arrangement all 

 of the variations .shown could be developed. Whether such a simple 

 arrangement w(nild represent the most generalized form or not 

 would l)e a matter of conjecture. 

 12 Ophisaaras ventralis I. inn. FIk 'i 



Three specimens of 0/;///.sy; ///•?/ .s irnlndis wen- taken in the Oke- 

 fiiiokee. 'i'he Lees, however, report that this lizard is not uncommon 

 and call it the "gras-s snake," giving as an explanation of the name 

 the fact that they have noticed that its locomotion app-ared diflieult 

 except in gra.s.sy places. They api)ly the name "joint snake" to an 

 entirely different reptile, which they describe as having joints around 

 the body and wliich may be lihineura fJorithtnd, although no speci- 

 mens were seen of this form. The three specimens collected wen- 

 taken in the grass on Billy's Island, but no data were secured as to 

 their life hist(n-y or hal)its. 



The two smallest specimens are rjuite different from the third and 

 largest and may be discu.s.'ied first. The.se specimen-^ measured,

 being in the length of the tails. Tlic longer of the two measured 

 162 nnn. to vent and the smaller 127 mm., while the distances from 

 t'p of ro.strum to eye and to ear in both specimens were identical. 

 The head of the longer specimen was 1| mm. broader than that of 

 the other. The two specimens agreed in scalation and in color. 

 The dorsal surface was light, rather cinnamon-brown, with three 

 very dark brown longitudinal stripes, two lateral and one dorsal, 

 the dorsal being slightly fainter than the lateral. The sides of the 

 head and of the anterior part of the body appear spotted; the entire 

 ventral surface of body and tail uniform lemon-yellow. The dorsal 

 rows of scales, of which there are sixteen, are separated from the 

 ten ventral rows by a distinct groove. The preanal scales are 

 slightly larger than the abdominal. The dorsal scales of the body 

 are carinate and are wider than long. The color and stripes therefore 

 agree with Cope's description of variation "11. J."^*

 Fig. 3. — Ophisaurus ventralis Linn. 



The plates of the head show the interfrontonasals separated from 

 the frontal bj' the two prefrontals which are in contact on the median 

 line and thus agree with Cope's "I. C.,"'^ but in addition show two 

 interfrontonasals, one anterior to the other, as in the subspecies 

 compressus {Ophisaurus ventralis compressus ■ Cop(^). These speci- 

 mens also agree with compressus in having but two rows of plates 

 between the labials and the canthal row; in having two large superior 

 labials touching the orbit below, and in having the caudal plates 

 at the extremity of the tail longer than Avide — characters which are 

 given as peculiar to compressus. The coloration, however, does 

 not agree with that given for compressus, and the body does not

.show ill the least the typical compression which distinguishes that 

 subspecies. In coloration these two specimens apparently agree 

 with U. S. Nat. Miis. Cat., No. 10,584, which Cope said restrained 

 him "from regarding the form compressus as a distinct species." 

 It is, nevertheless, interesting to note the gradation, since it makes 

 these forms from the swamp seem to stand between the typical 

 vetitralis and its unitjuc sul)spoci('s, the standing of which may be 

 subject to question. 



The largest of the three specimens is quite distinct in color and 

 form, although found in exactly the same locality, and may be 

 briefly characterized as follows: 



Body very stout and thick; dark brown above with many small 

 white spots irregularl}' placed on the head, and in more or less regular 

 longitudinal and transverse rows or lines on the dorsal surface of 

 the body and tail, giving the whole a checkered appearance. The 

 stripes are obsolete. Under surface of body sordid yellow-white; 

 the tail clear lemon-yellow beneath. There is but one interfronto- 

 nasal, and the sujx'rior labials do not touch the orbit. Superior 

 labials ten in number. Length 525 mm., maximum width 20 mm., 

 length to vent 265 mm. 



I'i. Cnemidophorus sexlineatus Linn. Plaie II, fig. 2. 



Apparently conunou throughout the islands of tiic swaiu]). Cer- 

 tainly one of the most common lizards on Billy's Island. Also 

 numerous on Hone}' Island and Minne Lake Islands. This lizard, 

 in spite of its swiftness, was easier to secure in the field than the 

 other common species on account of the fact that it did not possess 

 the disconcerting habit of dasjiiug along fences and through the 

 underbrush. 



It is locally known as the ''race-nag," a name which, like many 

 of the otlicr names used by the inhabitants of the swamj), was 

 strikingly deseriptive, since the lizard is so remarkably active and 

 scurries over the ground witii suri)rising speed when disturbed. 

 It ai)peared most abundantly in the j^lowed fields where the Lees 

 had planted corn, peas and goobers, and since these plowed fields 

 are very sandy, the common name of "sand lizard or swift" is quite 

 ap{)ropriate. They wen; conunonly seen among tin; "goober" 

 vines where their colors blended well with the lights ami shadows 

 under the leaves. The.se lizards seemed to jjrefer the bare furrows 

 for sunning themselves, and in the raised earth between the furrows 

 had dug their holes, into which they darted when disturlied. These 

 burrows extended in irregular directions to a depth of S or 10 indies, 

 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADKMY (1F [Mar., 



which made the disxs^inf; iiji of the hzards a comparatively easj- task. 

 Between the plowed furrows, also, in holes from 4 to 12 inches deep, 

 were deposited the eggs, usually four or five together. Tiic eggs 

 were about 16 mm. in length l)y 10 mm. in greatest diameter, 

 ellipsoidal, comparatively soft, semitranslucent, and almost salmon- 

 colored; not smooth or shining, but slightly rough and subpubescent. 

 Little data were secured on the life history or the breeding habits, 

 but from the fact that eggs were secured at this time — June — and 

 also the fact that several of the specimens taken showed the blue 

 abdomen characteristic of the breeding male, it is evident that this 

 month represents at least a part of the breeding and egg-laying 

 season. Since, moreover, the reptilian developmental period is 

 comparatively long, the bulk of ovulation must have been practically 

 over, or some of the females taken would have been found with 

 eggs, which was not the case. Specimens of C. sexlineatus were 

 found in the stomachs of two blacksnakes {Zamenis constrictor 

 constrictor, C. U., Nos. 6,157 and 6,155), a fact which shows that this 

 species of lizard, like many others, shares the fate of providing food 

 for the larger reptiles of the swamp. 



The variations of the specimens taken are especially interesting 

 from the fact that all those described are from one locality and were 

 all taken within a period of approximately a month, so that the 

 variations cannot l)e explained by season or habitat. 



A number of striking differences may be observed in the Okefinokee 

 forms as compared with Cope's description and figure,'^ which were 

 used as a basis for study. It should be noted that the figure shown 

 by this author (p. 594) does not agree with the description (pp. 594- 

 596). This is particularly true in the discussion of the head and 

 anal regions. For example, the figure (cf . Cat. No. 4,878, U. S. N. M.) 

 shows a small plate between the frontoparietals, while no mention 

 is made of such a structure in the text; the figure shows seven 

 supralabial plates, while the text notes five; four anal plates are 

 figured, while the description states that three is the correct number. 

 On the whole, the specimens examined conform much more closely 

 to the text of Cope than to his figure. 



The following variations are to be found in the Okefinokee speci- 

 mens, these variations being chiefly in scale and plate arrangement 

 rather than in size or comparative measurements, although none 

 were collected in the swamp which were as long as 235 mm., the 



>« Rept. U. S. Nat. Museum, 1898, pp. .593-598. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



length of Xo. 9,256, U. S. N. M., which is given by Cope as typical. 

 A table of measurements of various parts of the body shows a close 

 agreement in the relative sizes of body parts. The plates of the 

 head agree fairly well in number, but differ greatly in size and shape. 

 One of the most variable of the plates is the first supraorl)ital, which 

 may be entire, cleft, parted or completely divided, cutting off a small 

 caudolateral portion as a separate plate. The frontoparietals are 

 usually subequal to the parietals, but are sometimes smaller, seldom 

 larger. The frontal is usually pentagonal in shape, but the surface 

 varies from a tleeply three-ridged condition, which is the most 

 common, through an obsoletely three-ridged surface to one practically 

 fiat or slightly convex. The interparietal plate is sometimes bifid, 

 sometimes flat, but oftenest high at the centre and at the edge, 

 ^vith a submarginal depression or moat which is well defined. Pos- 

 terior to the parietals and interparietal the plates are most irregular 

 and varialile. In some specimens one or two distinct rows of plates 

 are found in this region, with from five to eight plates in a row; in 

 others only one well-defined row is present, and this is often inter- 

 spaced with very small plates or scales; more often all of the plates 

 of this region are small and indefinite in arrangement. The super- 

 ciliaries of the orbit vary from three to six, the usual numijer appear- 

 ing to be five. Of these the anterior two are carinate and the others 

 are convex or flat. The inferior orbitals range from three to five, 

 the anterior and posterior being usually small. The superior labials 

 arc generally five in numi)er; one specimen examined showed seven, 

 two had six, and one, four. One of the most constant of the charac- 

 ters of the species .seemed to be the femoral pores, of which fifteen 

 were found in the most typical specimen-^, the range being from 

 thirteen to seventeen, but other numbers than fifteen appearhig 

 very rarely. The anal plates, on the other hand, were decidedly 

 variable. In the maj(jrity of cases these plates agree with Cope's 

 descrii)tion: "three large scales, placed in a triangle, two posterior 

 to the other and with smaller scales behind." Thi«^ arrangement 

 seems to be typical, but even in the comparatively small series from 

 the Okefinokee one specimen was found with only c^ne anal plate, 

 f(jur with two — one posterior to the other one with three in a 

 longitudinal row, and several showed a wide granular space ijetween 

 the plates and the vent. In other regions the plates are quite 

 uniform and agree well with the arrangements noted by Cope. 



The color is quite constant and the stripes persist through life, 

 never becoming obsolete. A faint brownish band, sometimes 




132 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



double, is often found extending; down the median dorsal line of the 

 body. The scales of the fore leg, hind leg and thighs are i)raetieally 

 without variation in the specimens studied. 



It miglit be noted tliat in many of the specimens recorded from 

 the C)ketinokee the jjlate arrangement agrees much more nearlj^ 

 with the figure and description of Cneniidopliorus septemvitattus 

 Cope than with C. sexlineatus. This is noticeably true of the anal 

 plates, the general head structure and, in some cases, the femoral 

 pores. In fact, if the median dorsal longitudinal line which some- 

 times appears were more distinct, some of these specimens would 

 seem to merge into the tjpical septemvitattus. None of these speci- 

 mens, however, are as large as the type of septemvitattus (No. 2,872, 

 U. S. N. M.), nor do any show the colors of the unique specimen of 

 Cope's species, which appears quite distinct, resembling western 

 forms in general appearance and coloration, although the locality 

 given for the type specimen is denied by Van Denburgh,^^ and the 

 species does not seem to be as firmly established as might be wished. 

 H. Lygosoma laterale (Say). 



Not common. Only eight were taken in the swamp and but a 

 few others were seen. Of the eight specimens collected, one was 

 found under the bark of a log, one at the edge of a small stream, 

 almost in the water, one under leaves in the w'oods, and the rest 

 on the ground in open places. This species seemed comparatively 

 slow of movement and was not particularly difficult to capture. 



The specimens show'ed no peculiarities of markings or of plate 

 arrangement. The colors of the alcoholic specimens seemed to be 

 more or less obscured, but the dorsal surface usually retained the 

 characteristic bronze sheen, and the lateral stripes, although some- 

 what faded, were distinct. The ventral surface of the head and 

 pectoral region was normally yellowish-white, the throat and vent 

 lighter, the belly and under side of tail blue. The following note 

 taken of a living specimen in the field gives, perhaps, the most 

 accurate color description: 



Six rows ventral scales yellow from vent to fore limbs; chin 

 and gular region pinkish-white; a row of yellow scales above j'-ellow 

 ventral rows on either side; then five rows of dark-edged grayish 

 scales followed by a lateral black stripe; seven rows of reddish-brown 

 scales across the back. Reddish-brown of back marked off from 

 black lateral stripe by a thin reddish line. 



" Occasional papers. V. Cal. Acad, of Sciences, 1897, p. 133, note. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



The specimens were remarkably uniform in l)()th comparative 

 and in actual measurements, the differences being chieHy in general 

 body and tail lengths, rather than in variation in size of liml)s or in 

 distances between fixed points. 



In the discussion of the plates and scales of this species it should 

 be noted that Cope's description"* is most unsatisfactory, the ter- 

 minology being confused, if not actually inaccurate. 



The descripti(m given In* CI. A. Boulenger in his Cat. Lizarfh Brit. 

 Mus., 1887, \'ol. Ill, p. 263, proved the most useful and accurate. 



In the Okefinokee specimens the dorsal plates of the head are 

 absolutely uniform and may be described as follows: 



Rostral short; internasal pentagonal; nostrils piercing nasals; 

 no supranasals; frontal in contact anteriorly with internasal, and 

 two prefrontals widely separated jiosteriorly from interjiarietal by 

 two broad frontoparietals; interparietal kite-shaped, much longer 

 than wide; parietals 2; supraorbitals 4; superciliaries 7; superior 

 lai)ials 7. 



Little data wen* obtainai-)le regarding the life historx' of Lygosomn 

 Interale. No eggs were found. 



1'' Plestiodon quinquelineatus Linn. Fig. 4. 



ComiMon throughout the higher portion^ of the swamp and on 

 the islands, i^'eemed to be particularly fond of deserted buildings 

 and chinmeys where any such structures occurred, anil often found 

 along fences. The larger forms were called by tin? local names of 

 "red-headed scorpion" and "n'd-h«'aded lizard," while the smaller 

 strijied forms seemed to have no connnon local name, l>eing probably 

 confused by the natives with ('ni'ini(lo])li<friis tiexlincntus Linn. 

 PU'stiinlou (jiiinf/uclineatus was seldom seen on the ground or on tlu; 

 trees, but was often found stn'tchcd out in the sun nn dead logs, 

 .stumps or fallen timber. 



Although this was one of the nm^t cnnunon of the lizards ntitic<'d 

 in the Okefinokee, comparatively few specimens were collected on 

 account of the fact that their habits made it a difhcult inatfcr to 

 secure tln-m, since they dashed into crevices and holes or darte<l 

 along the fences or into the brush on the least provocation, 'i'hey 

 were abundant in tlie deserte(l log buildings on Hilly's Island and 

 were seen in large numbers in and around the old, abandoned liousc 

 on Mixon's Hammock, where they scurried over the ruined floor and 

 over the decayed timbers of the walls, only to dart into thd cracks

at the approach of the collector. In fact, had the object l)ccn the 

 .^^ecuring of "tails" rather than lizards, the collcctiii«(- would have 

 been far more successful, since the small blue-tailed form, particularly, 

 was prone to leave a tail wrigsrling in the collector's liand while its 

 ovNTier scurried to safety. 



Enough specimens were collected, however, to show practically 

 all of the stages usually recorded, from the small, black, brilliantly 

 marked form with the clearly bifurcated median stripe to the large, 

 l)rown, retl-headed stage with the plain brownish coloration, broad 

 head and obsolete bands. 



The specimens naturally varied much in size as well as in colora- 

 tion, the smallest taken l)eing 92 mm. long while the largest measured 

 237 mm. The coloration of the ventral surface of the body and head 

 seemed to vary according to the colors shown by the dorsal region. 

 For example, in the distinctly five-lined form, in which the dorsal

surface was nearly Ijlack, the ventral surface of the head and throat 

 was usually tinged or mottled with blue, while in the older brown 

 specimens with the brown dorsum and red head, the sides of the 

 head generally showed a tinge of orange and the white of the under 

 surface was permeated with red or yellow rather than with blue. 

 The belly in both forms was usually bluish, with the plates around 

 the vent approaching white. Although the .size varied considerably, 

 the relative length of the body parts was remarkably constant, 

 except in the width of the head, which is of course unusually broad 

 in the older males. 



The scale and plate arrangement of the Okefinokee specimens 

 varied but little. The supraorbitals usually showed six plates; 

 the superior marginal plates of the orbit nine, of which the middle 

 three or four were often very narrow; the superior laljials seven or 

 eight, the mo.st posterior being the largest. All of the specimens 

 but one, however, showed two large distinct occipital plates, rather 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 135 



than the irregular arrangement figured by Cope.^^ One specimen — 

 the largest — agreed with Cope's specimen (No. 9,234, U. S. N. M.) 

 in this respect. A variation was also noted in the plates of the 

 mental region. Cope's figure (ibid.) shows two unpaired plates 

 posterior to the mental. Of the .specunens taken in the swamp, 

 just half of the number collected conformed to this arrangement, 

 while the other half showed only one unpaired plate l^etween the 

 mental and the first pair of inferior labials. 



It can hardly escape the notice of the herpetologist that these 

 peculiarities (the single postmcntal plate and the two occipital 

 plates) here noted as variations of P. quinquelineatus are, except 

 for the postnasal, among the chief structural characters usually 

 given for the species P. anthracinus Baird, and the single or double 

 postmental enters into Cope's four main divisions of the genus. 

 Normal!}', one would expect two postmentals in P. quinquelineatus, 

 and it so proves by examination of a large series of extra-Okefinokee 

 specimens from other parts of southeastern United States, but this 

 .single postmental in the Okefinokee specimens is not limited to 

 small forms, as are most of the supposed species with single post- 

 mentals. The largest red-headed specimen (No. 6,339) has this 

 character, and another good-sized individual has only one post- 

 mental, but there is on one side of this plate the merest beginning 

 of a suture to suggest where the subdivisi(jn might come if it were 

 to be. We suppose Cope would be oljliged to make these "post- 

 nasal — one postmental" specimens members of his first division, 

 in which he places his Bermudan species, E. longirostris, but we could 

 hardlj' grant such a solution, and this restricted collection of Oke- 

 finokee skinks prompts a doubt of the actual rank of E. lotigirostris 

 and possibly of E. (udlimcinufi and E. plurialis, or, in other words, 

 we have our specimens referable to two of Cope's four main groups 

 for the genus, and if the postnasal character be proven variable this 

 P. quinquelineatuH may j'et ofTcr variants referable to the other two 

 divisions. Certainly, the status of the species of Plediodon is in a 

 most unsatisfactory state at the present time. 



The species /'. quinquelineatus ranges through a wide scries of 

 coloration during life, particularly as i)ertains to the stripes and 

 markings. The same bands apjx-ar in some specimens as arc found 

 in P. anthracinus, with a difTerence only in colors and brilliancy. 

 Since the .'Structural plate characters overlap, as has been iKited

 and eHinate be coii'^idcred as aHectiuK niarkiii.u;s, it may lead to a 

 reconsideration of tlie vahie of sucli a l)asis for specific distinctions. 



An interesting iUustration of regeneration was found in one of the 

 specimens taken (Xo. 6,839) in which the tail had been injured 

 75 mm. from the vent and a new tail (35 nun. long regenerated. The 

 old tail, howeviT. still jiersisted, and projected at almost right angles 

 to a (Ustance of 10 mm. with a small shrivelled stumj) on the end 

 suggestive of a spine or barb. 



Several of the specimens of Plestiodon quinquelineatus were infested 

 ■with red mites {Acarina), which appeared attached under the fore 

 legs. One individual had eight of these parasites under one fore 

 leg and twelve under the other. 



Crocodilia. 



16. Alligator mississippiensis Daudin. Plate II. fig. 1. 



The alligator was found to be extremely common throughout the 

 Okefinokee, and after the novelty of watching their interesting 

 habits had worn off, no particular attention was paid to them by 

 members of the party. Alligators were constantly being seen in all 

 parts of the swamp, and a short trip in any direction from Billy's 

 Island usually resulted in the noting of several specimens. Outside 

 of a few shot for their skins and those killed for food, no adults were 

 collected, as it would have been entirely impracticable to have 

 transported their heavy bodies out of the swamp. A number of 

 young were taken, and of these a half dozen or more were preserved. 



A trip down Billy's Lake, from Billy's Island to Mixon's Hammock, 

 was always the occasion for more or less sport in endeavoring to 

 approach the alligators as they lay on the banks, in following their 

 courses as they swam across the placid stretch of water, leaving 

 broad ripples in their wake, or in listening to the interesting vocal 

 gj'mnastics of the Lees as they endeavored by "grunting" to induce 

 a specimen to rise to the surface. The reptiles were often seen 

 sunning themselves in the rank masses of vegetation which lined 

 the shores and were not infrerjuently surprised at very close quarters 

 while they were swimming. 



Whoever has heard the bellowing of "gators" on Big Water or on 

 Floyd's Island Prairie will ever remember it as one of his most distinct 

 memories of the swamp and need ask for little else more blood 

 stirring or thrilling upon first acquaintance. The Lees claim the 

 young ones can bellow nearly as loud as the older ones and that they 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



distinguish them by the intervals, which are much shorter in the 

 younger ones. ]\Ir. Harper saw a five-foot alHgator at the north 

 edge of the swamp with his jaws tied witli a cord which for several 

 days it could not break. Later he observed that Bryant Lee could 

 hold shut the two jaws of a wounded "gator." 



Since these animals were found in every part of the swam]), no 

 mention of particular localities is of importance. They were most 

 abundant, perhaps, in Billy's Lake, in Floyd's Island and Honey 

 Lshind Prairies and in the head waters of the Suwanee River. 

 " 'Gator holes," however, were to be seen in all waters deep enough 

 to afford seclusion for the animals. These holes ranged in size 

 from a few feet across to large areas extending from 2.^ to 75 yards 

 in diameter. Throughout the swamp and in the prairies, also, were 

 l(jng open tracts in which no water-lilies grew, and these wow pro- 

 nounced by the natives to be " 'gator trails." 



The methods of hunting the alligator, as practised by the Lees 

 and other inhal)itants of the region, consist mainly of going out at 

 night in small boats and locating tlic animals l)y means of a lamp 

 fastened to the head of one hunter in the bow ol" the boat. Another 

 hunter in the stern i)addles or j^oles and uses the sharp end of the 

 l)usli pole to ''stick" the l)o(ly after the aninuil has been shot and 

 has sunk to the bottom. According to these hunters, who every 

 year take out a large nunil)er of skins, the eyes of the small alligators 

 a])pear red l)y the light thus used. whil(> those of the large s])ecimens 

 are yellow. The hunter carrying the light swings \n< head from side 

 to side through an arc of ISO degrees, and when an alligator is sighted 

 shoots it l)y the light of the lamp on his head. The conunon sup- 

 position that the skin of an alligator will turn the bullet of a gun is, 

 of course, unfounded. Since, however, only the head of the animal 

 is usually exposed when it is in tlu; water, they are connnonly shot 

 through the eyes. The hunters generally use a shotgun loaded 

 with buckshot. That a large number of alligators are annually 

 secured in this manner is evidenceil by the fact that the fields of 

 the Lees are strewn with the skeleton-^ .and dorsal strips of skin which 

 have been thrown away after each expedition. Only tlu' ventral 

 part of the skin is saved, the u|)per portions being too thick and 

 spiny to ;nlmit of the primitive methods of tanning, and therefore 

 the crest and dorsal scales are not retaineil. 



Plenty of <'vidence was secured to prove th.it the alligj^tor is a 

 formidable antagonist when in the water. The jiowerfiil tail is the 

 chief weapon of defence, ;ind with it the aniinal c.m deal a terrific 




13S PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC'ADKMY OF [Mar., 



blow. On June 13, 1912, a largc-siziHl allipitor was seen to slowly 

 sink below the surface as several members of the party in a small 

 boat were making a trip on Minnc Lake. Bryant Lee "grunted" 

 the animal to the surface, where it was shot, but not killed. It 

 rose within a foot or two of the boat and performeil a most remarkable 

 series of spinning movements, revolving rapidly on its tail with its 

 body directly upright and the head out of the water. Several shots 

 and repeated blows of the j^addle were required l)efore it finally 

 sank. 



The alligators of the Okefinokee showed no variation, so far as our 

 observations went, from the ordinary form of A. 77iississippie7isis , 

 which has been sufficiently well described by various authors to 

 make a description in this record unnecessary. The young which 

 were preserved agree also with the published descriptions and are 

 mo.st brilliantly marked in the smaller specimens. As the animal 

 increases in age, the fifteen transverse yellow bands become fainter 

 and the dorsal crest more pronounced. In the very young specimens 

 the dorsal tubercles of the neck are entirely absent. 



Xo nests of eggs were found, but a number of eggs were taken 

 from the bo(Ues of those killed. In one specimen (No. 6,493) were 

 found twenty mature eggs, ready for depositing. These eggs have 

 completely formed shells which are thin and soft, not brittle, and 

 grayish-white in color, with a granular coating which rubs off on 

 handling. The average length of these eggs is 3 inches and the 

 average diameter If inches. From a female 8| feet long, taken on 

 Billy's Lake, June 11, 1912, were taken 42 embryonic eggs ranging 

 in size from i to If inches in diameter, almost spherical and of a 

 dark orange color. The skin of these eggs is soft and smooth and 

 covered with shreds of connective tissue. With this female was a 

 large male about 11 feet long. 



Both the eggs and the flesh of the alligator are eaten by the inhabi- 

 tants of the swamp, and the tails of the young proved to be a very 

 acceptable article of diet. The meat is firm and white and in taste 

 somewhat resembles that of pike. 



One alligator was taken by Mr. John Needham on Billy's Lake 

 in December, 1913, but this was the only specimen seen on the trip 

 made at that time. Evidently, however, the alligators do not 

 entirely disappear even during that season of the year. 

 17. Crocodilus americanus Laurenti. 



Xo crocodiles were found in the Okefinokee. Nevertheless, there 

 is a persi.stent idea throughout the region of the swamp that these 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



animals liave been .seen in its waters and are still occasionally to 

 be encountered, although the evidence offered is very meagre and the 

 descriptions given of the so-called crocodiles are far from satisfactory. 



The natives describe the crocodile as being much durkor in color 

 than the alligator and state that in the crocodile the upper jaw is 

 movable instead of the lower. This latter notion, it may be ob- 

 served, is common throughout this part of the country, and is insisted 

 upon by many hunters, although the basis for the idea is n^t evident. 

 On the other hand, the chief points of scientific distinction between 

 the two animals is never touched upon by those who profess to have 

 seen the crocodile, and even such striking differences as the longer 

 snout and the more active movements of the latter animal appear 

 never to have been noticed. 



Bryant Lee states that crocodiles have i)een taki'U in the region 

 around Cow House, but that he has never seen one south of Honey 

 Island. Joe Saunders in-;ists that he has seen crocodiles in a creek 

 flowing into the Suwanee River in Clinch County, while Jackson Lee 

 says that he knows of at least two crocodiles being taken in Billy's 

 Lake. These hunters, when pressed for details, state that the chief 

 distinctive character of the crocodile is the color of its eyes, which 

 they describe as red or orange, and the much darker color of the body. 



These men have spent their lives in the swamp and are remarkably 

 close observers, and it is evident that the form which they have in 

 mind is in some way different from the comnian alligator, but it 

 seems unlikfly that it is i'rocodilus (uncrinnms.

No State in the I'nited States has furnished more distinctive and

 tion than Florida, yet none of these numerous ophidian collectors 

 and students has ever entered Okefinokee at Florida's northern 

 border. The nearest approach came about twenty-five years ago 

 in the visit of the ornithologist, Mr. ('. F. Batchelder, of Cambridge, 

 Mass. He si)ent a day or two on Mitchell and Black Jack Islands. 

 To the eastward, at St. Mary's, (la., and at Fernandiiia, Fla., he 

 took the following specie.s:

Osceola cUipsoidea, OphiholnH grtiiliis (jcluhfK.

^M PROCEEDIXCS OF THK ACADKMY OF [Mar.. 



1879, July. 1880. and .\pril 7 18, 1882, prove most instructive, for 

 this locality is not far south of Bay Swamp, the Floridan extension 

 of the Okefinokec Swamp. Mr. Bell has the following list: 



Abastor errfthrogramnius* Osceola elapsoidea, 



Fnrancio abacurn, Ophiholus (jctuhis getulus, 



Hctcrodon platyrh inns, Xatn'x fasciata fasciatn,

Compsosoma corais coupcrii* Ancistrodou conlortrix* 



Pityophis melanoleiicus* Crotalus adainanteus. 

 Osceola doliata parallela, 



Of the above 22 species, seven (w'ith asterisks) are not in our list. 

 All of 'these seven we might expect in southeastern Georgia, and 

 were in our Avorking hypothetical list before the trip was taken. 

 They represent the remaining Austroriparian forms which were not 

 taken by us, and with the truly Floridan peninsular snakes almost 

 complete the whole list of southeastern Uniti^d States forms. Fur- 

 thermore, these seven (with Abastor erythrogrammus, a mud and 

 aquatic snake eliminated from consideration) represent the assem- 

 blage of southeastern species which most prefer the dry pine forests 

 of the Atlantic coast or dry open or sandy fields where the gopher 

 turtle occurs. We have no doubt that these seven occur on the 

 Atlantic seaboard to the immediate east of Okefinokec and also in 

 its outskirts. In fact, the natives held that there were several 

 kinds of snakes outside the swamp which were not within it, and, 

 among these, they named the coachwhip snake. Besides, the 

 gopher turtle, the as.sociate form of the above seven, occurs outside 

 the swamp, but not A\athin it. 



To the northwest about forty miles, at Nashville and Alapaha, 

 Ga., William J. Taylor, from July 19 to November 18, 1881, took 

 seven species of snakes, of which Elaps fulvius docs not appear in 

 our list. The seven are: 



Farancia abacura, Sistrurus miliar ius, 



Heterodon platyrhinus, Ophibolus getulus getulus, 



Haldea striatula, Elaps fulvius.* 

 Natrix fasciata sipedon, 



In addition to these collections from Messrs. C. F. Batchelder, 

 J. Bell and W. J. Taylor, Cope also had material from St. Simon's 

 Island. 




1915.] NATLRAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 141 



In the earlier day.s, Holbrook received some material from the 

 region to the eastward of the swamp {vide Tropidonotus taxispilotus).^^ 

 In another place (Vol. IV, p. vi), he writes: "J. Hamilton Couper, 

 Esq., of St. Simon's Island, Georgia, has also furnished me with 

 several Serpents of that state; and to him I owe a knowledge of 

 the Gopher Snake, perhaps the largest and most beautiful of our 

 Serpents." Of this form, Mr. Couper saj's:^^ '"I have only .seen it 

 in the dry pine hills, south of the Alatamaha; and I have never 

 met with it in the low grounds even of the same vicinity." This 

 may explain its absence in the Okefinokee. In this connection, it 

 is interesting to observe that the same seven absent forms (except 

 Cotnpsosoma corais couperii) occur in Dr. Holbrook's Catalogue- 

 of the Ophidia of Georgia. In it 33 species of snakes are listed. In 

 C. S. Brimley'b^ Records of Some Reptiles arid Bairachians from 

 the Southeastern United States we find 21 species recorded from 

 Georgia. Five {Compsosoma corais couperii and Abastor erythro- 

 grammus being absent) of the seven species missing from Okefinokee 

 are given in his list as taken either at Riceboro to tiie northeast or 

 at Mimsville to the west. 



In 1871 and 1876, Paul Fountain visited this area and he writes:-' 



*'I can assure the lover of Nature, if he is prepared to run the risk 

 of fever, that tiie farther he forces his way into its gloomy depths, 

 the more remarkable and beautiful will be the forms of animal and 

 vegetable life he will discover." Later he says: "A greater 

 number of reptiles may be found in this swamp than in any other 

 spot I know of in the States." And he reserves his discussion and 

 digression on snakes in general for his chapter on .1 Dinj in a Cyprc-'<s 

 Sicojnp (( )kefin()kee) . 



In 1888, Cope published On the Snakes of Florida;-^ and this 

 paper lias considerable bearing on some of the Okefinokee species; 

 but, inasmuch as it is eml)raced in Cope's great work,^^ The Croco- 

 dilinns, Lizards, and Snakes of North America, we will not consider 

 it in detail. In 1890, the next list of .some pertinence is Rcmnrki^

142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



From Septomlier. 1892, to July, 1893, Prof. Kinar Loonnberg,-^ 

 of University of Upsala, Sweden, was engaged in collecting in Florida 

 and his Notes, etc., published in 1895, proves one of the most 

 important herpetological papers on southeastern United States in 

 the last quarter of a century. He secured 30 species of snakes. 

 Nine of his 30 species are not represented in our collections, three 

 being genera peculiar to Florida, one, Tantilla coronata, occurring 

 in Georgia as well, not being recorded, however, from the Okefinokee 

 Swamp, and five proving of the same assemblage as Bell's seven 

 (Gainesville) species missing from the Okefinokee Swamp, because 

 they are more especially dry pine land forms. 



The 21 species taken in the swamp represent a distinctly Austro- 

 riparian element which does not entirely shun moisture. The 

 collection of 165 individuals apportioned numerically among the 

 21 different species of snakes indicates very roughly the degree of 

 abundance on Billy's Island or its immediate environs. The list follows : 



Heterodon platijrhinus.... 38 Elaphe obsoletus 6 



Ancistrodon piscivorus 16 Opheodrys (estivus 5 



Thamnophis sirtcdis ordinatus . 15 Farancia abacura 3

Lampropeltis doliatus coc- Cemophora coccinea 1 



cineus 6 Crotalus adamanteus 1 



Sistrurus miliarius 6 Haldea striatula 1 



None of Cope's (1900, p. 1207) four peculiar snake genera {Stilosoma, 

 Seminatrix, Rhadinea and Liodytes) of the Floridan region enter the 

 swamp, and none of the Floridan sauria, unless the other limbless 

 lizard described by the Lees proves to be Rhineura. One lone speci- 

 men of Hyla gratiosa of the amphibians w^as taken, and, with the 

 birds, there is a Floridan tendency, but it is not very pronounced. 

 Of the above 21 snakes, Thamnophis s. sackenii of Cope's Floridan 

 snakes occurs in the swamp, and there are forms which might be 

 termed T. compressicaudus and T. f. pictiventris. 



The largest portion of the Okefinokee material in this report 

 represents the collection made by the Cornell University expedition 

 during the summer of 1912 (May 28-July 13). The party included

 material which added four species to our list and nicely augmented 

 our series of previously kno\\Ti forms. In the fall of 1913. Prof. J. C. 

 Bradley and Paul Battle spent a week on Billy's Island and brought 

 out a few reptiles. In December, 1913, Profs. J. G. Needham and J. C. 

 Bradley, Messrs. John Needham and Paul Battle made a trip of ten 

 days into the Okefinokee and collected consideral)!e data on the winter 

 conditions. Some of their material they brought out, but they left a 

 container which was filled by the Lees by August 1,1914. This collec- 

 tion has not been received and is not incorporated in this report. All 

 the members of these various parties and, particularly Prof. Bradley, 

 collected snake material and data and, to each of them we are deeply 

 indebted for aid, good ('f)mmunal spirit and material encouragement. 

 Acknowledgments are due Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, of the United 

 States National Museum; Dr. Witmer Stone and Mr. H. W. Fowler, 

 of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, for the privilege 

 of examining types in their respective collections, and to Messrs. 

 li. W. Bennett and ('(^melius, of Fargo, Ga., without whose courteous 

 a.ssistance it would have been impossible to have transj)orted our 

 material out of the .swamp. 



The Lees proved very efficient collectors, 'i'hey enjoy life in 

 this naturalist's paradise and do not live in constant fear of the 

 numerous venomous snakes and dangerous animals of the swamp. 

 They do not alter their course in life because of them, though they 

 respect and a|)preciate the danger and know wh;it bad wounds some 

 can inflift. They bathe in the lakes where many accidents might 

 befall them, but usually do not. The children go barefoot and were 

 our best and most vigilant scouts about the Lees' clearing. Many 

 a snake, both large and small, they "stepped on," if they did not 

 "cromb" it with a stick. They knew not the noose, and to it \\c had 

 littU' recourse except on rare occasions. The gun proved very 

 serviceable in the thickets. The Lees' fields and clearing were the 

 resort of turtles, lizards and oviparous snakes which sodght them 

 for breeding purposes.

 <;unis and other niainnials come for the (>ii<i;s buried in tiie sand. 

 Over this same <z;round the kiui;- snake. l)lack snake and pilot snake 

 .<;earcli for the same (juarry and the reptiles which Uiy the CKg^^. 

 The natives liave a very good itlea of the economic vahie of the 

 variou.s snakes and spare most of them, except the truly poisonous 

 forms and what they call the "Water" and "Highland Moccasins" 

 {Tropidonofus and Tlxnnnophis). One of the many roles which the 

 natives accredit the black and turkey vultures is that of enemies of 

 snakes and some l)irds of prey, e.g., the Buteos engage in the same 

 jiractice. The snakes also suffer from the herons, il)ises and cranes, 

 but with these the rejitiles are a .second choice when frogs and toads 

 are availal)le. 



The numljer of snakes with internal parasites is surprisingly 

 large, 37 of the 165 being thus afflicted, or 8 of the 21 species. They 

 are: 



Heterodon platyrhinus 14 Thamnophi.s s. sackeni 2 



Ancistrodon pi.scirorus Lanipropellis getidus 1 



Coluber constrictor 5 Sistrurus miliarius 1 



Tropidonotus taxispilotus 5 



Thamnophis s. ordinatus 3 37 



No doubt, other species also suffer, for this list represents the 

 species of which we had the largest series. The above species are 

 about equally distributed between the terrestrial and aquatic groups. 

 In number, the former are 24 and the latter 13 ; but, if the spreading 

 adder be eliminated, the terrestrial forms lead liy 3. It is a significant 

 fact that the species which are the worst sufferers are also inveterate 

 feeders on toads and frogs of all kinds, and it is quite possible that 

 these nematodes and other parasites reach the snakes through their 

 food. 



According to habitat, these snakes may be divided as follows: 



Islands. 



Heterodon platyrhinus, Elaphe obsoletus, 



Coluber constrictor, Opheodrys wstivus, 



Lampropeltis getulus, Diadophis punctalus, 



Crotalus adamanteus, Elaphe guttatus,

If these snakes be considered from the point of view of locomotion, 

 they fall into the same four groups which Loennberg (1895, pp. 

 336, 337) made, and the snakes are quite similarly, but not absolutely, 

 arranged as he found them:

Or. viewed from the standpoint of breeding, they are al)out eciually 

 divid(>d: the poisonous snakes, Tropidonotus, Thmnnophis, Storeria 

 and JIdldai, heing ovoviviparous, and all the rest oviparous. 



Finally, if the Okefinokee snakes i)e grouped aeeortling to food, 

 liased largely on stoniaeh eontents, hut also on observations of the 

 haunt, time of aetivity in the swamp and on the keen knowledge 

 of the natives, these snakes are arrangeil as follows:

S. occipitomaculala, 



S. dekayi, 



0. oestivus. 



It is apparent at once that insects, etc., prove the important food 

 of the smaller snakes, ten of the 21 .species falling in this group and 




1915.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 147 



only one of the larger snakes being in this category. Doubtless, 

 all the 21 species will eat insects to a certain extent. The species 

 which are almost exclusive insect feeders are Haldea striahda, Sto- 

 reria occipitomacidaia, Storeria dekayi and Opheodnjs cvstivus. The 

 reader must bear in mind throughout this discussion we are treating 

 Okefinokee snakes and not the species throughout its entire range. 



With the larger snakes, the food most generally sought is Anura 

 or Amphibia in general. It is par excellence the food of the aquatic 

 snakes, and with these four or five species it usually is some species 

 of Rfina, though Acris, Chorophilus or Ilyla may rarely appear as 

 their prey. Equally important are frogs in the food of the larger 

 land snakes, 5 species being addicted to them. With these the 

 southern and oak toads (Bufo) are easily of first importance, with the 

 tree frogs iHyla) and the narrow-mouthetl frog (Engystoma) occupy- 

 ing second and third places. In fact, these 10 snakes prefer the 

 soft-bodied frogs and toads to any other food of the swamp (reptilian 

 eggs not considered), and if they were to be restricted to any one of 

 these categories they belong to this group. 



Fish enter into the food economy of all the aquatic species, the 

 bream and killifishes proving the common bait. L. d. coccineus 

 ate fish, as doubtless .some of the island forms do when the smaller 

 fish become cut off in landlock(Ml pools on the islands. 



In general, the lizards are .swift (except the ground lizard), and 

 fall prey only to some of the swifter coursers of the islands. How- 

 ever, at least 5 sjiecics ate them or their eggs, 'i'hc turtles when 

 young and soft are occasionally taken by the moccasins and possibly 

 by the other acjuatic snakes, the young soft-shelled turtles (Plnfy- 

 ptllis ferox) being the species most attacked. On ihc land, the 

 turtles' eggs are eaten by at least 2 species, if not i)y many more. 

 This .source of food is one of the commonest of the swamp for man, 

 mammals and snakes. At least one-third of the species are canni- 

 balistic and will eat snakes, either adults or young, or eggs. 



'i'he warm-bloo<led groups, birds and mammals, suffer from the 

 same foes. Seven species of tlu* largest snakes of tlu; swamp assail 

 t hem, their eggs or young. Four of t hese seven are t he four poisonous 

 snakes of the swamp, while the other three are the pilot, black ami 

 king snakes. In addition, the manunals have an inveterat*' foe in 

 the corn snake, which apparently does not molest birds. None of 

 these .seven or eight .species are aquatic hut one, the mocca.sin. 



The threr omnivorous coursers on the islaiuls are the king snake, 

 pilot snake and tlie lil.ick snake, wliil<- in the watiT the only .snake 




14S PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



which includes insects in its diet to any extent is the southcin riband 

 snake. One must he impressed with the innnense abundance of the 

 reptiUan forms, tlie restricted island quarters for these reptiles and 

 the need of great nmiibers to keep each species existent under such 

 strenuous vicissitudes. Each form, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird 

 or manunal, has untold foes which are close at hantl, fellow-travellers 

 of the same course and seekers of the same breeding grounds already 

 crowded. Never have we been so struck with the incessant warfare 

 of primeval nature as on these islands of the Okefinokee. 



Another very interesting fact is the isolated nature of the place 

 Avhere these 165 snakes were taken. They are virtually a collection 

 of Billy's Island ophidians with a few other islands and portions 

 of the swamp represented. Our series of each species becomes, 

 therefore, verj- significant if several variants appear. They cannot 

 be designated as geographical subspecies or varieties and must be 

 considered only as indicating the inherent range of variation which 

 a species may manifest in one Hmited geographical region, not what 

 might appear in an extensive or expansive stretch of territory. 

 Hence, the value of the material, though not as numerous as might 

 be desired. 



Without doubt, many of the conclusions and observations in this 

 paper are not new and are only corroborative of previous work, but 

 they may have interest because of their independent nature. The 

 more significant conclusions are: 



1. That Tropidonotus fasciatus and most of its subspecies, T. 

 compressicaudus, T. ustus, T. hisedus and T. rhombifera, need to be 

 restudied before they can be finally accepted. 



2. That Elaphe obsoletus confinis, E. o. lemniscatus, E. spiloides, 

 E. Icetus and E. quadrivittatus are too closely intergradient to be so 

 distinctly designated. 



3. That Lampropeltis getulus getulus, L. g. sayi and L. g. splendidus 

 are possibly variations within one region. 



4. That Thamnophis sirtalis ordinatus is the color form of the 

 Okefinokee, though its recognition as a good subspecies may be 

 questionable. 



5. That Lampropeltis d. coccineus and Osceola elapsoidea are to be 

 corLsidered one and the same. 



6. That Diadophis a. stidogenys is not deserving of separation 

 from Diadophis punctaius. 



7. That Farancia abacura may have white-bellied forms as well 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 149 



as those with the typical red ventral coloration, and that this albin- 

 istic character is not solely an adult or young variation. 



8. That our specimens of Heterodon platyrhinus are one-third 

 platyrhijius, one-third intermediate and one-third niger; that possibly 

 niger is an adult end phase, and that one platyrhinus specimen agrees 

 perfectly with Heterodon broicnii Stejneger, both in the absence of 

 the azygous plate and in coloration. 



9. That the two specimens of Storeria dekayi have not 17, but 

 15 rows of scales, like »S'. occipitomacidaia, and one of the two speci- 

 mens has the oculars not 1-2, but 2-2, as usual in the red-bellied 

 species, the lone representative of which has the ocular formula 3-2. 



10. That the range of the southern ribbon snake, T. s. sackcni, 

 is not restricted on the Atlantic coast to Florida. 



11. That C. horridus of the Okefinokee is distinctly the light 

 canebrake form of this species. 



1. Farancia abacura (Holbrook): Horn Snake; Retl-bollicd .Snake; Hoop Snake; Rainbow 

 .Snake; Mud Snake; Checkered .Snake. 



Three specimens were taken, and from native accounts it appar- 

 ently is fairly common, but hard to secure. In distribution this 

 species reaches from Virginia to Florida and from Indiana and 

 Illinois to Louisiana and rarely into Texas. The nearest records 

 are from AUapaha, Ga., to the northwcsi, and from Gainesville, 

 Fla., to the direct .south. 



Coloration. — The horn snake is one of the most beautiful snakes 

 of North America. The ground color is a blue-black, the smooth 

 and shining scales have an enamelled surface, and the gastrosteges 

 and the scales along the sides have a fluted appearance. Every 

 labial, mental and gular plate has a blue-black spot in its middle 

 The color of the back extends to the gastrosteges in vertical bars or 

 inverted triangles, the apices being on the gastrosteges. I'sually,, 

 at each one of these apices appears an oblong spot, and in the cephalic 

 half of the body, the venter, as a result, presents a row of these 

 spots on either end of the gastrosteges, thus giving a distinct light- 

 colored band down the mid<lle. In the caudal half of the bo<Iy tiie 

 vertical i)ars of opposite sides usually meet or alternate on the 

 mid-ventral line, producing a checkered appearance. The vertical 

 black bars are two .scales wide at the end of the ga.stro.stege.s and 

 three or four scales wide on the 4th row of scales, 'i'lie lighter 

 intervals between the dark bars are two scales wide at th<< end of 

 the gastrosteges and one wide at the 4th row of .scales. Each gular 

 gastrostege has a black band across it. 




loO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADKMY OF [Mar., 



Tli(> li«;lit(>r color of the venter extends to the -Jtli row of scales 

 in the younger specimens. In these, usually at the neck of the 

 light interval, there appears one or two l)lue-l)lack sjxjts to suggest 

 the almost complete invasion of the body color upon these areas in 

 the large specimens where the light areas seldom reach the 2d row 

 of scales and where there are large central black spots on the scales. 

 Our specimens have G3, G4 and Go light vertical bars or wedges, 

 respectively, or from 50-53 from the anus forward. Curiously 

 enough, the two specimens which we first took alive, one 151.7 cm. 

 long antl the other 43 cm., were ivhite beneath, and not red. The 

 other preserved specimen has also the whitish appearance. Tw^o 

 of the specimens in alcohol may possibly have a slight tinge of 

 pinkish, but it is faint if present at all; surely, it is not yellow. These 

 three white-bellied Farancias are noteworthy. H. H. Brimley^* 

 took a large white-bellied adult male, which was coiled with a normal 

 male and female in coitu, but our specimens, however, are not all 

 adults, one being only 43 cm., the largest, 151.7 cm., and another 

 intermediate 81.1 cm. The native present when we caught the 

 largest specmien asserted that he had seen red-bellied forms of this 

 snake, and, in December, 1913, Profs. Needham and Bradley saw a 

 beautiful red-bellied individual of this species. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The gastro.steges w^ere 194, 195 and 

 196, respectively, in our three specimens; the urosteges, 39, 39, 42; 

 the scales 19-19-19; supralabials 7; eye over 3d and 4th supralal)ial; 

 infralabials 8; loreal elongate; temporals 1-2; nasal with groove 

 below nostril; in C. U., No. 6,108, a groove above the nostril as well; 

 anal plate and the gastrostege before it divided; in the caudal half 

 of the body G or 8 rows of scales on the dorsum with a suggestion 

 of a keel on them. 



Habits. — The largest specimen (No. 6,108) was taken in a dark 

 cypress thicket (between Billy's and Gallberry Islands), wherein a 

 Florida barred owl had retreated. In water ankle deep or more 

 our guide accidentally stepped on the snake, thinking it at first a 

 moccasin. He recoiled and then quickly shot it. The smallest 

 .specimen (No. 6,107) wa.s secured in the most difficult tangle (Minne 

 Lake trail to Minne Lake Islands) of the whole swamp, where the mag- 

 nificent cypress trees and associated undergrowth were thickest. On 

 a mat of .sphagnum it rested, and when alarmed quickly shot down

into it. Our first hold of this snake was not secure and it as quickly 

 began burrowing the second time. From all that we observed of 

 the living snakes of this species we would consider them timid, 

 harmless burrowers. They are decidedly inhabitants of the twilight 

 parts of the swamp, and their eyes suggest such a habitat. If found 

 during the day, they appear in the dark, gloomy cypress ponds on 

 the islands or amongst the dense vegetation of the deepest and 

 most inaccessible regions of the swamp. We discovered no par- 

 ticular superstitions regarding its horny tip. It is curious to find 

 the hill hoop-rolling story also associated with this species, which 

 to my mind is one of our most acjuatie species, and the names 

 "cj-press" or "sphagnum" snake would be equally appropriate witii 

 some of the names suggested by its structures. 



Food and Breeding. — Xone of the specimens had food in thrir 

 alimentary tract and no parasites were found. The natives relate 

 how the thunder snake (L. getulus) digs beneath rotten logs and other 

 cover for the adults and young of this species. Of the breeding 

 habits of this oviparous form we know little. The natives assert 

 that the progeny of one female sometimes reaches 40 to -13. 



2. Diadophis panctatus (I.inn»us): Ring-necked Snake. Plate III, fig. 1. Fig. 5. 



This species is probably fairly common on the islands of the 

 swamp. Three specimens were secured on Billy's Island between 

 June 11 and 15, 1912. 



(.'oloralion. — All three specimens are bluish-black or i)rown al)ove, 

 the color extending on to the end of each gastrostege. These black 

 spots on either extremity appear as a row on each side of the yenter. 

 In No. (),105 they are very ob.^cure on the neck region. In all three 

 the d(jrsal scales are with pale edges and with numerous fine ligiit 

 specks. In Xo. 0,104 the edges of the dorsal scales are opalescent. 

 In Xo. «),10() there is a median row of body-colored spots down the 

 venter to the anus, all the urosteg(>s and ga-^trostege Xo. 2 being 

 without spots; the same applies to X<». (').105 with the urosteges and 

 gastrosteges Xos. 15, 8 unspotted; in Xo. 0.101, the median row is 

 very interrupted, no spots being on gastrosteges Xos. 1 20, except 

 Xo. 3, and none l)eyoiid X<». 133, while between Xos. 21-133 there 

 arc several missing. In No. 0,105, \\\v nuchal half collar is 1-2 

 scales wide; in Xo. 0,100 it is the same width, but interrupte«l by a 

 median clorsal row of bla<k scales, while in Xo. (i,104 it is faint 

 except on the lower sides. In Xo. 0,105, the mental and labial 

 regions are almost immaculate, a few infralabials being with faint 

 black spots; in Xo. «i,l(M, each infralabial is well marked with one 




152 PROCEEDINGS OF THK ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



or more hhick spots as the syinphyseal is; in No. G,10(j, the geneiala 

 as well have these spots. 



Dimensions and ]'ariations. — The total length of these three 

 snakes reaches from 19.5-29 cm.; the tail from 4.7-5.8 cm. or 4|-5J 

 in the total length; the gastrosteges are 143-150; the urosteges, 

 39-46; anal divided, and in one the gastrostege ahead is also divided. 

 Tail very spike-like and sharp. Scales 15-15-15; temporals 1-1; 

 oculars 1-2 in No. 6,10G, the preociilar large on the right side and 

 small on the left side, the prefrontal taking the place of the normal 

 upper preocular, 2-2, in Nos. 6,104 and 0,105. The supralabials in 

 No. 6,106 are 8, with the eye resting on the 4th and 5th; in No. 

 6,105 on the right side they are 8, with eye on the 4th and 5th, while 

 on the left side there are 7, with the eye on the 3d and 4th; in No. 

 6,104 there are 7 supralabials on each side, the eye being over the 

 3d and 4th on each side. In Nos. 6,105, 6,106 the supralabials 

 have the clear band of ventral color, but in No. 6,104 this color is 

 heavily encroached upon by black.

Fig. 5. — Diadophis punclatus (Linn.) 



In view of Cope's establishment of D. amahilis stidogenys upon 

 three specimens from New Orleans, Pearl River, Miss., and Savannah, 

 Ga., the last locality not far from Okefinokee Swamp, our three 

 specimens prove interesting. To find these three showing such a 

 gamut of differences is rather fortunate. Our specimen No. 6,104 

 is almost a duplicate of Cope's D. a. stidogenys. It has 7 supra- 

 labials, a speckled gular and labial region and the eye resting on the 

 3d and 4th supralabial; but like his specimen, the three abdominal 

 rows of ventral spots, the 150 gastrosteges and other characters 

 suggest D. punclatus. It was taken under the same log as an almost 

 immaculate-chinned D. punctatus, which has 8 supralabials on the 

 right side and eye on the 4th and 5th and 7 supralabials on the 

 left side and eye over 3d and 4th. No. 6,106, captured in a similar 

 habitat, is a good D. pundalus in scutellation, but has the gular and 

 labial regions spotted as in Cope's subspecies. The numerous 

 variations in these three specimens, the circumstances of their 

 capture, the isolated character of their habitat (Billy's Island), an 

 inspection of Cope's type and Dr. Stejneger's previous decision and 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



concurrence (study of Diadophis in manuscript) — all force the 

 authors to consider this subspecies untenable. 



Habits. — This attractive snake was found during the tlay under 

 cover, usually under logs near the cypress edges of Billy's Island. 

 It seemed to prefer localities near the edge of the thicker woods. 

 In one case it was under a log in a place near and exactly similar to 

 the situation described for Halden striatula. In the other instance, 

 the two were taken (June 11, 1912) under a log near Billy's Island 

 landing at the woody edge of cultivated fields. The D. a. stictogenys 

 specimen was first taken and a few minutes later the other specimen 

 was found under the same log. The former may have been seeking 

 the .sandy fields of the Lees where lizards, snakes and turtles resort 

 in great numbers to lay their eggs. This specimen had six unlaid 

 eggs which measured as follows: 18 x 9 mm., 19 x 9, 19 x 9, 20 x 9, 

 20 X 9, 21 X 10. The covering is thin and quite pinkish in alcohol. 

 This .species seems as nocturnal in Okcfinokee as our experiences 

 with it elsewhere suggest. These specimens had insect and worm 

 remains in their alimentary tracts.

Thirty-eight specimens were secured, of which 10 were young 

 snakes; one was a cast skin. 



Cohrntion. — In coloration our scries show all jjossible patti'rns. 

 The 16 young were all of the spotted i)ha.se and manifested the 

 following pattern: The ground color may be yellowish, brownish 

 or reddish. Down the back is a series of 20-132 .s])()ts and on the 

 tail 7-9 spots which become transverse bands. The color around 

 these dorsal spots is brighter or lighter than the surrounding i)od> 

 color. Alternating with aiul almost touching the corners of the 

 dorsal .spots is a .series of lateral spots. In the cephalic region, one 

 of these spots of each side with a pair of successive dorsal spots btrin 

 a (|uartette — an arrangement soon lost in the caudal part of tin- 

 body and .seldom .seen in adults. Beneath these spots may be seen 

 one or more seri«'s of small spots, not very distinct in form. The 

 venter is grayish or greenish-white, heavily blotched with l)la<'k or 

 l)rownish. The head has a black bar connecting the upper anteri(»r 

 edges of the orbits; another l)ar from the vyv to the angle of tlu; 

 mouth; and a third, on oceijjital plates, i)osterior margins lof supra- 

 orbitals and frontal. This black spot luis a backward extension on

just back of till' occipital i)lat('s. Oltcn this median ])rolunti;atioii 

 is cut off and surrounded by body color. Usually on the occipital 

 suture and occipitofrontal suture aiijx'ars a lij^ht spot. 



In some of the ailults the same s('ii(>ma of coloration obtains as 

 in tlie young, exce])t that dorsal and lateral spots are less distinct 

 as such and boconu" more transverse areas with light intervals. 

 Furthermore, the supralabials are more prominently spotted in the 

 young. 



(^f tlie 21 specimens of adults, 8 were of the black (niger) type 

 with slaty-gray below. In most of these 8 the gular scales and 

 whole chin except in two become the darkest portion of the whole 

 venter. Of the spotted forms (platyrhinus), we had a few with the 

 l»rick-red on the head and neck antl somewhat on the body. In the 

 intermediates, the approach to the black phase begins in the head 

 region and the head first becomes black, or it and the neighboring 

 cephalic region. In this process the transverse light intervals 

 remain brightest and persist longest in the tail region. Some of the 

 specimens are almost niger in the cephalic region, })ut platyrhinus 

 in the caudal half, or three-quarters niger with the scales of the light 

 intervals of the caudal region with incoming black centres. About 

 7 of the adults were true spotted adders and 6 intermediate. Thus, 

 of the adults we have an almost equal division of 7 spotted, 6 inter- 

 mecUates and 8 blacks. Most of our large.st specimens were black 

 or fast approaching that stage. The black seems to be an end phase 

 of size or age, possibly not always attained in an individual, but 

 certainly the spotted phase is most prominent in the smaller speci- 

 mens of the collection. Besides, it might be remembered that none 

 of the 16 young were black, but all true spotted forms. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The 16 yoUTig vary in length from 

 13.7-19.6 cm., while the adults are from 35-104.2 cm. (1 ft. 2 inches- 

 3 ft. 5 inches). Po.ssibly the species may reach 4 feet in length and 

 a circumference of 6 inches, largest .specimen being 5 inches in girth. 

 The gastrosteges range from 120-146, average 130; the urosteges 

 30-59, average 48; the anal is divided, in several with half a gastro- 

 stege ahead; the scale row formula of 18 individuals is 25-25-19, 

 the other formula being 23-23-17, 24-22-17, 24-24-19, 25-21-19, 

 25-22-21, 25-23-18, 25-23-19, 25-25-18, 25-25-20, 25-25-21, 

 25-25-23, 26-25-21, 27-24-18, 27-25-19, or in the middle of the 

 body from 21-25, exceeding the usual range of the 3 species of 

 Heterodon by the loss of two rows (in 21-rowed condition) or in the 

 cephalic region extending from 23-27, two rows bejond the normal

 3-4 on both sides in twenty-seven specimens, 3-4 on one side and 

 3-5 on the other in three specimens, and 3-i and 4-5 in one specimen; 

 the supralai)ials are 8 in twenty-seven specimens, 9 in seven speci- 

 mens and 9-8 in three specimens; the infralabials are 11 in fifteen 

 specimens, 10 in three specimens, 12 in five, 13 in one, 10-11 in four, 

 10-12 in three, 11-12 in five and 12-13 in one. Tlie orbital ring 

 exclusive of the supraocular is 10 on both sides in thirteen specimens, 

 11 in one, 9-10 in two, 9-11 in two, 10-11 in fourteen, and 8-10 in 

 two, i.e., 22 of the 38 with number of oculars different on the two 

 sides.

 the following .scutellation: Kastroste^es, 123; urosteges, 55; anal

side, and two others (Nos. G,17S and (),20r)), l)oth small individuals, 

 have 2 loreals on one side and 1 on the other. Another (No. 6,204) 

 has 2 loreals on one sitle and 3 on the other, if an extra scale between 

 the oculars, loreals and 3d anil 4th supralal)ials be called a loreal. 

 This small extra scale also occurs in No. 6,170. 



Habits. — This interesting snake proved very common around the 

 Lee's sandy clearing and in all dry parts of the swamp. It was the 

 first form to be observed and of it more specimens were taken than 

 of any other species. One might find it beside the trails or on the 

 islands where no human courses led. They were often taken about 

 and in the corn, "chufa," '^goober" and "yam" fields of the Lees, 

 where the snakes probably resort for breeding. Here it did not 

 seem to be solely a case of light-spotted phase for dry and sandy 

 places and dark phase in more woody and moist situations. In 

 the same open fields we find one phase one day and the other the 

 following day. In two instances we took adult spotted and lilack 

 phases \nthin 40 feet of each other. We dare not make a distinction 

 between the two as to habitat, sex, food, etc., unless it be size or 

 age. In this case, often the oldest ones are not always black or 

 blackish, but they seem to tend that way. Of its "spreading" or 

 flattening we saw evidences, and the natives are well aware of the 

 assorted tlefensive repertoire of this curious snake. They had none 

 of the superstitions about the emanations from it affecting the 

 atmosphere, nor did they believe that it "spat" its poison when 

 hissing. In all our captures we saw no particular signs of ill temper.' 



Breeding. — This snake is oviparous. All through the month of 

 June we were finding the snakes in the planted fields of the Lees and 

 more than once almost stepped on the clumsy females of this species. 

 To these fields they came to lay their eggs, and throughout June 

 and later the boys were continually turning the eggs up to the surface 

 as they cultivated their fields in their primitive fashion. The eggs 

 invariably were in sandy soil and were usually 4 or .5 inches beneath 

 the surface. Sometimes in one set as many as 11 or 12 would be 

 found. One specimen (No. 6,175), taken June 3, 1912, had 22 eggs 

 far from ready for ovulation. Another specimen (No. 6,171) had 

 30 eggs, 16 on the right side and 14 on the left side. But the egg 

 complement may go beyond this 12-30 range. On June 19, Mr. 

 Paul Battle took a large Heterodon, from which he and one of the 

 authors squeezed 42 eggs. The females were not all of one phase: 

 some were black, others spotted. The above eggs were white with 

 much thinner integuments than those of the black snake and without 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 157 



the granules of the latter. These 42 eggs average If (30 mm.) x 

 yf (21 mm.) inches and are not far advanced in development. 



Food. — We can hardly hold that the black forms eat frogs and 

 toads and that the light ones will refuse frogs. Of course, if one 

 grants the more moist situations for the dark phase, such a differen- 

 tiation of diet preference might possibly occur. Our specimens 

 preferred toads. Three had each a southern toad (Bufo lentiginosus 

 lentiginosus) in their stomachs. Another had eaten three southern 

 toads, two full gro\\ii and one half grown. Three had partaken of 

 beetles and two had taken grasshoppers. 



Parasites. — Fourteen of the 21 adults had parasites in their stom- 

 achs or intestines. Sometimes the sole contents of the alimentary 

 tract might be a bundle of parasites; in individual cases the stomach 

 would be absolutely filled with them. No snake compares with the 

 spreading adder as a host for these anmials, and it may be due largely 

 to its strong Anuran diet.

Three specimens of this species were secured from Billy's Island, 

 on June 5, 1912, and the other two from July 15-Noveml>er 1, 1912. 



Coloration. — This species is bright green above and usually yel- 

 lowish-white below and on the labials. In two of our specimens 

 the green of the back extends across the caudal two-thirds of each 

 gastro.stege, but the chin and the labials are more or le.ss yellowish- 

 white.

 is a small scale hardly a tcmijoral; if this We not a t('in|)oral, the 

 temporal fornuila for all three is 1 2: infrahihials 8, the fifth largest; 

 supralahials S in one specimen and 7 in the other two, eye resting on 

 the 3d and 4th sui)ralal)ial; scales 17 IT-lo, the lower row smooth, 

 the second row very faintly keeled. 



Habits, Food. — In our exi)i'rience this species is decidedly arboreal, 

 and Profs. Crosby and Hradley record the same habitat for it. The 

 specimens were taken from small bushes, and it is a close second 

 to Elaphe obsoletu.s and its allies in its tree-climbing proclivities as 

 the records and its long, slender body testify. This species is quite 

 thoroughly insectivorous, one specimen having undeterminable 

 in.sect remains in the rectum; another, a i)artly digested beetle larva, 

 and the largest, parts of a tree cricket and other orthopterous remains 

 with insect eggs presumably belonging to the prey captured. 



5. Coluber constrictor L : Black Snake; Black Racer; Racer; Black Runner; Blue Racer; 

 White-throated Rarer. Plate III, fig. 5; fig- 8. 



This slender snake was one of the most common species of the 

 islands, but only thirteen of them were captured because of their 

 speed. 



Coloration. — In coloration this smooth-scaled snake is shining 

 black above and slaty or plumbeous beneath; the white chin and 

 throat in most of the specimens occupy the mental, infralal)ials, 

 geneials, first 2-3 gular gastrosteges, the cephalic gulars and the 

 lower edges of the supralabials; two or three of the larger specimens 

 have slaty chins except for a small white spot, which in one case 

 covers parts of the mental, inner border of the 1st and 2d infralabials 

 and the anterior geneials, while in the other it occupies 1st gastro- 

 stege and two gulars. One medium-sized specimen (No. 6,lo2) 

 has more of a bro\Mi tinge, and the gastrosteges are slaty except for 

 the caudal borders which are distinctly white; another specimen 

 was decidedly whitish on the caudal ventral third of the body. A 

 young specimen taken June 23, 1912, had spots on the back vaguely 

 di.scemible and on the venter had a series of pink spots near the 

 ends of the gastrosteges. These spots were lost entirely in the 

 region of the 90th- 100th gastrosteges. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These snakes vary in length from 

 71.4-127 cm.; the tail from 18.1-35.4 cm. or 3.4-3.8 times in the 

 total length; the gastrosteges are 176-189, average 182; the uro- 

 steges, 92-110, average 103; anal plate cUvided; in three specimens, 

 the ga.strostege ahead of the anal plate is divided or a quarter gastro-

stege is cut out of it; in eleven of the thirteen specimens the scales 

 are in 17-17-15 rows; in No. 6,206, 19-17-15, and in Xo. 6,207, 

 19-15-15; preoculars 2, the upper one often with a transverse furrow 

 extending across it for ^ to ^ of its width; post oculars 2, except in 

 Xo. 6,152, where 3 are on the left side; temporals 2-2-2, rarely 

 3-3-3, or 3-2-2, or 1-1-2; infralal)ials 8, in four specimens 9 on 

 one side; loreal 1, but in Xo. 6,157 there are two, the upper, one 

 being cut off from the prefrontal; rarely the postnasal is transversely 

 divided; supralabials 7, in Xo. 6,154 there are only 6 on the left side, 

 the normal 5th and 6th having united; in Xos. 6,150 and 6,156 

 8 supralabials are on both sides, while in Xo. 6,151 there arc 8 on 

 one side and 7 on the other; whenever eight supralabials occur, the 

 eye rests on the 4th and 5th supralabials, not on the 3d and 4th. 

 This eight supralabial condition Cope thinks rather peculiar to 

 the Plains (flavivenlrif<) or Pacific (vetustum) forms of C. constrictor.

The presence of throe /iiiecimcns with 8 supralaldals and 1 loreal 

 and one specimen with 7 supralabials and 2 loreals suggests that 

 in C stejnegerianus these characters are hardly of enough value 

 for the estal)lishment of this new form on these slender grounds 

 alone. In fact, distinctive scutcllation characters between C. 

 constrictor and ('. Jluje'lnin become .scarce in tlie light of this large 

 percentage of 8 supralabials in our collection. The characters of 

 the; frontal and color beconK! more; than ever tlu; main reliance. 



lldhilH. — This species and tht; spreading adder are the two m(jst 

 common snak(!s of the drier parts of the swamp. It seems \o prefer 

 the cover of the blueberries and saw palmettoes, where it swiftly 

 pursues its j)rey. It, however, also appeared conunonly alxnit tlu; 

 Lee's clearing, where it was often seen but seldom captured. Only 

 when we could get it in the open did we stand a fair chance of taking 

 it alive, so lightning-like are its movem 'Uts. In fact, it is fast 

 enough to catch anything which moves on the ground of its environ- 




160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



mcnt, and no doubt its ojiinivorous appetite is partly due to its 

 speed. It can clinil) anions; the Inishes, though we usually found it 

 on the ground. The natives think it beneficial and allow it to climb 

 into their corn cribs because it catches the troublesome rats and 

 mice. 



Food. — It is considered harmless, antl of its antipathy for rattle- 

 snakes we neither saw nor heard any evidence. It doubtless will 

 attack the poisonous snakes, but not to the extent that its arch- 

 enemy, the king snake, does. Its speed is marvellous, and all the 

 lizards of the swamp prove its prey. This even includes the "race 

 nag" {Cnetnidophorus scxlineatus), which suffers most; at least two 

 of our specimens had the tails of these lizards in their stomachs, 

 indicating that the lizards were swallowed head first. One cannot 

 help wondering how the blacksnake captures these speedy reptiles. 

 Another species which the blacksnake uses for food is the slowest 

 lizard of the islands, the ground lizard (Lygosoma laterale). In some 

 of the specimens we found sand in their stomachs. This species is 

 ver>' fond of frogs and toads, all the dry-land forms being in the 

 list, the toad {Bufo I. lentiginosiis) occupying first place. One 

 snake had 4 adult Carolina tree frogs (Hijla carolinensis) and 1 

 pine-wood's tree frog {Hyla femoralis) in its stomach; all being 

 taken head first. It seems not to scorn insects, beetles being the 

 principal group identified. 



Parasites. — This species is quite badly troubled with internal 

 parasites, five of the thirteen specimens having such in their ali- 

 mentar>" tracts. The first snake captured — a young one — had mites 

 all along the edges of the gastrostegal plates, a condition subsequently 

 observed in one or two other specimens. 



Breeding. — The black snake is oviparous. One individual taken 

 June 1, 1912, had 14 half-sized eggs; another taken June 8 had 11 

 eggs in about the same condition. On June 21, a specimen was 

 taken with 5 mature eggs. On June 19, Mr. Farley Lee went out 

 to get some smudge wood at 7 P.M., when darkness had just begun. 

 Upon lifting a rotten log he found a female blacksnake which was 

 laying its eggs under the log. It had laid three eggs, and we suc- 

 ceeded in forcing another from the specimen. In the female were 

 five more, making the complement 9 in all. Only two kinds of 

 reptilian eggs exceed these in abundance and ease of discovery, 

 namely, those of the Florida cooter (Chrysemys floridand) and of the 

 spreading adder {Heterodon platyrhinus) . The four eggs above 

 mentioned measured as follows: 




1915.] NATURAL SCIEN'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 161 



32 mm. (Ij inches) x 18 mm. (y^^ inch), 

 39 mm. (lj\ " ) x 16 mm. (f " ). 

 36 mm. (If j. " ) x 17 mm. {{i " ). 

 30 mm. (lj\ " ) x 18 mm. (|i " ). 



Three others quite fresh in appearance when ploughed up were: 



36 mm. (ly^ inches) x 17 mm. (|| inch). 



36 mm. diV '' ) x 18 mm. (H " )• 

 41 mm. (If " ) x 16 mm. (f " ). 



Another batch of four taken in a similar way had been developing 

 for a time and at preservation measured: 



36 mm. (ly^ inches) x 22 mm. (| inch). 



33 mm. (lyV " ) x 23 mm. (| " ). 



34 mm. (If " ) x 22 mm. (| " ). 

 36 mm. (lyV " ) x 22 mm. (| " )• 



In all these eleven eggs the usual shape is elliptical with blunt, 

 rounded ends. In the first and second sets, one egg is much more 

 elongate and one end more pointed than the other. This tendency 

 toward the ovoid form also comes in the third set, where development 

 has progressed and the increase in size has been in girth. All these 

 eggs when laid are white with tough, coracious shells which are 

 covered with small crystal-shajx'd or cup-like granules. These 

 make the egg quite distinctive.

 Minifi'- Snake; House King Snake; House Snake; Spotted Snake; Spotted Racer; Spotted 

 Coluber; Red Coluber. 



Only two specimens (Xos. 6,229, 6,230) were taken July 15- 

 November 1, 1912, after our departure. Beyer^' thinks of them as 

 fairly common in pine-wf)od regions, but says, "It is not found in 

 the swamp lands, being strictly terrestrial in its habits." Certainly, 

 this form must have travelled through swamp to reach Billy's Island 

 and doubtle.><s encounters moisture enough on the islands. 



Coloration. — This beautiful snake is light red or ashy-gray, with 

 a series of dorsal dark red, crim.son or brick-red saddles or transverse 

 bars. These are 3 5 scales wide, occupy from 10 13 rows and have 

 dark-edged borders. On one specimen there are 50 in all, 3() before 

 the vent and 14 beyond it; in the other, there are 41 blotches, 29 

 before the vent and 12 beyond it. On either side ajijx'ars an alter- 

 nating row of smaller dark-borilered red spots. Anteriorly, these

become very narrow and tlie elongate black borders constitute most 

 of the spot>«. The third row on tlie first four rows of scales only- 

 shows distinctly in the anterior region. The venter has a tinge of 

 the color of the back, but appears to be mainly white or yellowish- 

 white, tessellated or checkered with quadrangular black spots. In 

 markings of the head these specimens very well agree with Elaphe 

 (jutintus guitatus. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These two specimens are, respect- 

 ively, 97.3 and 111.8 cm. long; the tails, 16.2 and 18.7 cm., or 6 in 

 the total length; the gastrosteges are 218, 227; the urosteges, 69 

 and 68; anal divided; the scales are 24-27-18 and 23-27-19; the 

 oculars 1-2; the temporals 2-3 (4) and 2-3; the supralabials 8; 

 the infralabials 11 and 12. 



Food. — This species belongs to the group known as rat snakes, 

 and each specimen proves true to racial reputation. In the stomach 

 of each we found a full-gro"s^^l rice-field ra;t {Oryzomys palustris) and 

 other remains. Both of the rats had been swallowed head first, and 

 we firmly believe them to have been taken alive. This requires 

 considerable dexterity in nature where the prey is not cornered and 

 may also be another bit of evidence to show this species more aquatic 

 than usually thought. No parasites were found in the alimentary 

 tract of either specimens. 



7. Elaphe obsoletus (Say): Pilot Snake; Chicken Snake; Spotted Chicken Snake; Gray 

 ColuV^er; Gray Rat Snake. Fig. 9. 



Six specimens of this puzzling form were taken, and we regret 

 this series is not larger. However, this small collection confirms 

 us in the belief that Scotophis confinis B. and G., Coluber obsoletus 

 lemniscatus Cope, Coluber spiloides Dum and Bib., possibly Scotophis 

 Idtus B. and G., and Coluber quadrivittatus Holbrook are individual 

 variations of Elaphe obsoletus. This conclusion in its main features 

 is in agreement with Boulengcr and Rhoades and partly in accord 

 with Hay's and Brown's diagno.ses of these forms of the genus Elaphe. 



Coloration. — The ground color of the specimens is an ashy-, 

 bro\\Tiish- or yellowish-gray with a series of 30-36 dorsal grayish- 

 brown to dark chocolate-brown spots on the body and 9-16 on the 

 tail. In the cephalic half of the body these spots have their anterior 

 and posterior edges concave, i.e., their angles produced, thus giving 

 the spot the shape of a ray's egg; in the caudal part of the body the 

 dorsal spots are more or le.ss quadrate. Occasionally, the 1st and 2d 

 or the 2d and 3d dorsal spots are more or less united. In one speci- 

 men for its entire length (Xo. 6,136) these dorsal .spots are connected 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1G3 



at the angles by a longitudinal stripe on each side, as in Coluber 

 obsoletiis lemniscatus Cope. The dorsal spots are 3-4 scales long 

 and cover 8-10 jows of scales. On the 2d-6th rows occurs a lateral 

 row of spots which alternate with the dorsal spots. In the anterior 

 region they become very elongate and linear. In No. 6,136, with 

 two faint dorsal longitudinal bands, this lateral row is connected 

 by a longitudinal band on each side, the band obscuring the spots 

 in the caudal half of the body. Thus, in this specimen, we have 

 the four bands of C, quadrivittatus, but the spots of C. spiloides or 

 C. o. confinis, in other words, a good C. o. lemniscatus Cope. To 

 add to the confusion, the temporals on one side are 2-3-5 while on 

 the other side they are 2-1-2. Beneath the lateral row of spots 

 occurs another row just above the gastrostegal keel of each side. 

 Each of these spots is opposite a dorsal spot and occupies the first 

 row of scales and the ends of 2 sometimes 3 gastrosteges down to the 

 gastrostegal keel. Sometimes, however, this lowest row of spots 

 does not alternate with the lateral row and sometimes this lowest 

 row is obscure. The venter in the large specimens is yellownsh-white 

 or straw-color (most yellowish in the quadrivittatus-lemniscntus 

 specimen), while the two smallest .specimens have it whitish or 

 ashy-white. In some, irrespective of size, the venter in the cephalic 

 fourth or fifth of the body is immaculate, while in others it is with 

 spots like the ground color of the dorsum; the venter posteriorly 

 may be almost solid in color like the dorsum. In some, the chin 

 and throat area may \)o immaculate yellow, yellowish-white or white 

 or the gulars maj' be slightly grayish. In all the infralabials have 

 l)lack borders as have the supralal)ials, but the intensity of this' color 

 varies. Two specimens have no postocular band at all, one of the 

 smaller ones has it indistinct, another has it on one side and al)sent 

 on the other and two have it very prominent. Only two have the 

 <larker black prefrontal cross band (on posterior margins). The 

 presence or absence of head bands in this as.semblage of snakes is 

 too variable and individualistic a character to l)e of much weight in 

 separating species. Some of our specimens have the head uniform 

 like the body color; others are with di.stinct head bands. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The six specimens vary in length 

 from 68.7 144 cm., the tail from 12.8-27 em. or 5.0 6.2 times in the 

 total length. The ga.strosteges range from 231 243. or average 236; 

 the urosteges arc 71-92 or average 85; anal divided, in Xo. 6,135 

 entire; the oculars are 12, except in Xo. 6,135 where 1 2 and 2 2.

 spiloides, obsoletus obsoletus, obsoletus lemniscatiis, and Icetus — rather 

 too strong an individualistic a variation in a localized collection of 

 six to make it a stable and cardinal character of primary dictinction. 



Fig. 9. — Elaphe obsoletus (Say). 



The scale formulas are 29-29-19 for two specimens, 29-27-19, 

 27-27-19, 26-29-19, 25-27-17; from 9-23 keeled rows of scales; 

 anterior chin shields touching 4th and 5th infralabials. 



Our specimens agree best with Coluber spiloides Dum. and Bib., 

 although equalh' well with C. obsoletus confinis if Cope's first temporal 

 scale be considered abnormal for this form. One specimen seems a 

 good C. obsoletus lemniscatiis, if not more than an incipent C. quad- 

 rivittatus. All in all, if the supposed diagnostic characters of these 

 four break down in a collection of six snakes from one isolated envi- 

 ronment, one must question the weight to be attached to such dis- 

 tinctions. 



Habits. — This agile and slender snake is the most arboreal snake 

 of the swamp. Its compressed body with the gastrostegal keels on 

 either side where the sides abruptly meet the venter suggests an 

 arboreal form and its habits confirm the belief. This species was 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



found along the water courses near Billy's Lake. Here they climb 

 up the i)ushes and small trees which skirt some of the streams of the 

 swamp. Our first specimen was (3 feet up above the water, and they 

 have ascended 10 or more feet in our few experiences with them. 

 7'hev are probably far more comnifm than our collection might imply, 

 but their position, the cover of the dense herbage ancl the color of 

 the body, all make them rather difficult to find. 



Breeding. — This is an ovoviviparous snake and three specimens 

 taken June 1, 3 and 15, 1912, had the eggs quite immature. One 

 had 18 on the left .side and 15 on the right side; another had 14 in 

 all. 8 on the right side and (3 on the left side. 



Food. — No doubt this form secures much of its footl in the bushes 

 and trees it so commonly frequents, and true to the reputation of 

 E. ohsoletus of the north this Okefinokee representative proves an 

 enemy of the birds. The natives steadfastly held that it ate birds' 

 eggs and young. One specimen had partaken of some kind of eggs 

 and a secoml individual had birds' feathers in its stomach. A 

 third snake had eaten the pine-wood's tree frog {Hyla femoraU.^). 

 This species also frequents the islands and feeds on the ground. 

 Here they do damage to the ground-nesting birds, as many of the 

 other species of snakes do. They also often enter poultry yards 

 for rats and mice as well as the hens' eggs. One of the native boys 

 brought us a pilot snake which he claimed was caught in the act of 

 swallowing a hen's egg. and stomach contents sul)stantiated his 

 claim. They report that they have taken some which had eaten 

 as many as ten at one time. None of these six snakes had para.sitcs.

on the venter and sonietiines tlu>ir ends alternate. Frequently, the 

 black bands of a jiair have their ends uniting with each other and 

 not with opposite ends. Occasionallj' the process goes farther and 

 on the sides a black bar extends from one black band to another 

 across the white interval and we have part of a white interval com- 

 pletely encircled by black dorsally and ventrally as well as on the 

 sides. The black band on the neck is not complete on the ventral 

 side in any of the six individuals; ahead of it, comes a white or 

 yellowish-white interval, narrower on the dorsum but wider on the 

 sides where it extends across the angle of the mouth onto the upper 

 posterior labials and on the lower surface of the head. The black 

 occipital bar in one specimen is limited to one occipital; in the 

 others it generally reaches to the temporals and the posterior edge 

 of the frontal and the supraoculars. In one specimen there is a 

 black band back of the eye, and in another the occipital black bar 

 covers the occipitals, most of the frontal, all of the supraoculars, 

 postoculars and 1st temporal and the upper surface of the two 

 posterior supralabials. Sometimes the supralabials near the eye 

 and rarely a few infralabials immediately below may have dark 

 margins. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The total length varies from 23.7- 

 57.6 cm.; the tail, 3.4-8.9 cm. or 6-7.2 times in the total length; 

 the gastrosteges are 172-189; the urosteges 39-48; anal entire; 

 the supralabials 7; infralabials 8 except on one side of No. 6,240, 

 where there are 9; the oculars are 1-2. 



From a study of these six specimens from one locality we were 

 led to conclude that Lampropeltis doliatus coccineus and Osceola 

 elapsoidea were the same form, and this conclusion came independ- 

 ently of the previous judgments of Brown, Brimley and others. 

 Brown says,^^ " tj^^ }^gad plates and scales are becoming variable, 

 specimens being found without a loreal and with the scales reduced 

 to nineteen rows. This extreme reduction is Osceola elapsoidea 

 B. and G., and is not common, but intermediate stages are frequent; 

 out of some thirty specimens colored as in coccineus I have met 

 Anth two without a loreal and with 19 rows. The case is peculiar. 

 If constant, the distinction would be a generic one; on the other 

 hand, the importance of the character involved would seem to 

 lift it out of the ordinary category of intergradation, for we appar- 

 ently have a subspecies being transformed under our eyes. On

the whole, it may accord liest with a sound method to take no note 

 of this form at its present stage." C. S. Brimley says that in his 

 experience ''the normal formula is, scales in 19 rows, occasionally 

 17 or 21, one temporal in first row, occasionally two, and loreal 

 usually present, but sometimes absent on one or both sides. "^^ Only 

 in his Florida specimens were the scales in 17 rows. Like these, 

 our specimens have a greater reduction in number of scale rows 

 than Cope's material, the formuke being 17-15-15, 17-19-15, 17- 

 19-15, 17-19-17, 17-19-17, 17-19-17. This is a reduction far 

 beyond the 21 rows of Cope's and Brown's descriptions and if an>- 

 thing below the better normal of Brimley. So, in this respect, our 

 specimens incline towards Osceola elapsoidea. Furthermore, only 

 in the specimen (Xo. 6,100) with this reduction carried farthest 

 (17-15-15) do we have the loreals of both sides absent, but it is one 

 of the largest of the six specimens. In this individual the prefrontal 

 has descended to the level of the labial and in the forms (L. d. cocci n- 

 eus) with loreals these plates must be derived from the prefrontal. 

 In Xo. 0,242 the loreal is very small and linear, while in Xo. 0,240 

 it is normal and (juadrangular on one side and triangular on the 

 other, the apex not even touching the jireoeular. In 3 specimens 

 (Xos. 6,101 the smallest. 0.241, 249 the largest; the loreal is present 

 on both sides and a prominent quadrangular plate from the pre- 

 ocular to the nasal. 



Ilahiis. — This species is more or less of a l)urrower, but a glance 

 at some of the largest specimens suggests Elaphe .snakes in their 

 compressed deep bodies with sides sharply defined from the venter 

 by a ridge. Such elaphine snakes climb well and of such evidenet" 

 in L. d. coccineus we have only the capture of a snake taken .lune 0, 

 1912. It was found on one of the frames of an old l)uiidiiig, ihc 

 snake being ^0-4 feet al)ove the ground. 



Food. — In food habits this .species is more or less of a constrictor. 

 It feeds on ground lizards, skinks, swifts and other snakes and 

 insects. In the stomach of Xo. 0.212 we found an angleworm and 

 the remains of two killifishes, suggesting more of .-my a(juatie n.-iturr 

 than usually ascribed, but after ev«'ry rain liilly's Island is covered 

 with little water pools containing fish which as evaporation goes on 

 become stranded. Such would be easy of capture. Our specimens 

 yielded no clue to the oviparity or breeijing of this species.

ThirtiMMi spot'inu'ns of this fine snake were tiikcn and many more 

 seen. It is eonnnon throuffjiout the (h'ier parts of tiie swamp and 

 frequents the outskirts of the swamp as well. It keeps to the islands 

 and none were taken in other situations than the saw pahnetto or 

 heath soeieties of the jiinev woods where it courses througii the low 

 cover after its living |)rey or eggs. Okefinokee swamp comes within 

 the supposed range of L. 'j. (je(uli(s and is considerably east of Louis- 

 iana where L. g. sayi is recorded. The nearest records of L. g. 

 getulus are from Fernandina, Fla. (C. F. Batchelder), Gainesville, 

 Fla. (J. Bell), and Nashville, Ga. (W. J. Taylor). 



Coloration.— yiost of the specimens at hand vary from a light to 

 a deep brown. Five are shining lilacki.sh-brown in body color, Ijut 

 these are among the smallest .specimens of the collection. All thirteen 

 have white or yellowish cross-bands which may Ije from 23 25 in 

 number on the body proper, rarely as low as 18, and from 5-10 on 

 the tail. Often these l)ands are incomplete and appear onl\' on one 

 side with none corresponding on the other side, and frequently in 

 such specimens the cross-bands may be diagonal — not strict cross- 

 bands: in many of the specimens the bifurcations on the sides are 

 absent and the cross-band scales of the dorsum have dark body color 

 tips which at times so blacken the scales as to interrupt the bands 

 completely. In one specimen the band was very indistinct. These 

 bands are normally 1^-2 scales wide on the dorsum or rarely 2, rarely 

 3-5 scales wide on the .sides where the bands bifurcate bordering a 

 spot of body color. These lateral spots alternate with similar 

 dorsal areas and are from 3-7 scales wide and occupy the lower 

 2 or 3 rows of scales as well as the ends of 3-5 gastrosteges. The 

 dark dorsal areas are 7-10 scales Avide; in some they are a beautiful 

 shining black or deep brown; in two or three of the specimens each 

 scale of the cephalic half of the body has a pale central spot; in three 

 specimens with shining black body color the first four to six dark 

 areas back of the head had patches of scales with white centres as 

 con.spicuous as the cross bands themselves (suggestive of L. g. .splen- 

 didus); finally one brown (Xo. 6,218) king snake has all the scales 

 with every centre of the same intensity of color as the conspicuous 

 cros.s-bands (very^ suggestive of L. g. sayi). The venter is of the 

 same color as the cross-bands anrl is heavily blotchefl with l)lack 

 due in part to the extension of the lateral spots on the ga.stro.steges. 

 All the head plates are conspicuously marked with white or yellowish

 scn/i and splendidus intorgratle so imperceptibly and specimens from

 characters. 



Dimetisions and Vdriations. — These specimens vary from 67.6- 

 144.4 cm. (2 ft. 1 in.-4 ft. 9 in.) and the tail from 9.1-19.3 cm. (.7.4-

 urosteges are 41-54 or average 49; the scales are 21-21-19 in eight 

 of the specimens and the other formulas are 21-23-19, 22-21-19,

ViiH.. H). — Ijfiinitropillis (/(lulus (irliilns (Linn.) 



//«6<7.s.— This species is one of the iiKtst strikiiml>' marked >nakes 

 of the swamp. The shining black or brown witli the contrasting 

 white or yellow cros-s-bands makes its appearance very attractive. 

 In nature, it is mild, proves an interesting and safe p«'t, and in \u< 

 instance during our stay in the swamp did it display any tendency 

 toward belligerency or sulh'nness toward any member of tlie party. 



Food. — The natives recognize its good nature and consider it harm- 

 less, though the king of the snakes. They are aware of its usefulness 

 as an enemy of moccasins and rattlesnakes and report several 

 combats which always resulted successfully for the king snake, but 

 thi'se unlettered people, unlike many sentimental writers, do n(tt 

 hold that the king snake deliberatelv searches for the poisonous 

 snakes in particular. We, as they, believe it the enemy of every 

 species of snake in the swamp, preying of course more on the terres- 

 trial species of its own haunts. .Ml the smalN'r snakes sudTer. and 

 of the larger species, the blacksnake and spreading adder are the 

 commonest prey. It is surely a good ■"pilot" to the n.atiirali^t 




170 PROCEEDINGS OF TlIK ACADKMY OF [Mar.^ 



whenever one finils it digging, for it almost invariahly iueuns otlier 

 snakes, eggs or some good capture. It will seldom fail to react i)er 

 schedule if you loosely hold it in one hand and a live blacksnake 

 in the other. Almost before you can predict the outcome, the 

 former may be far within its captor — a demonstration we have tried 

 more than once in the field. It is especially fond of young snakes. 

 One of our specimens had taken a newly hatched Heterodon and the 

 natives recounted several occasions when they had found it working 

 beneath a log for what proved a brood of young snakes. We do 

 not tloubt but that it feeds on mice, rats and other small mammals, 

 but of such evidence we found little in the swamp. Possibly, in 

 early spring or in the fall these are more its reliance. The principal 

 food of this species is turtles' eggs, with snakes or their eggs a second 

 choice. Four of our specimens had eaten Florida cooters' {Chrysemys 

 floridana) eggs which they dug out of the sand and two had mud 

 turtle {Cinosternum pemisylvanicum) eggs in their stomachs. Mr. 

 Francis Harper tells us that he and David Lee almost stepped on a 

 king snake. After their recovery, what should they find but a 

 Kinosternon digging in sand prol)ably preparatory to laying and the 

 king snake was close at hand. In fact, so addicted are they to this 

 egg diet, that the natives consider that it is a common happening 

 to find the snake awaiting the egg deposition. Unless it be the 

 Florida bear, there is no form in the swamp which eats turtles' eggs 

 in such ciuantity as the king snake. It will take a whole nest of 

 eggs at one time, as many as 14 being found in the stomach of one 

 snake. 



Breeding. — Of the breeding habits of this species we have a few 

 scant notes. Mr. Harper reports a pair of them mating on May 19, 

 1912, and says another king snake was watching the pair. One 

 of our specimens (Xo. 6,145), taken June 13, 1912, had 7 fair-sized 

 eggs. Only one of the specimens had parasites, and this had two 

 large parasitic worms 30 mm. long fastened to the outside of the 

 esophagus and lying in the body cavity.

 and westward to the Mis.sissippi Valley.

anteriorly; the back and .sides with 20 pairs of l)lack half-rings, the 

 first on the head, the lOth just back of the anus and the last two 

 rather indistinct. The black half-rings are widest dorsally, on the 

 sides the black rings of a pair approach each other soon to diverge 

 again as the 4th-2d rows of scales are reached. An irregular l)lack 

 spot on the 1st row of scales at the lower end of each white interval 

 sometimes unites the ends of two half-rings; bands between half- 

 rings ivory-white with very fine dots all over the scales. Width 

 of each black half-ring usually two scales, but one scale wide half 

 way down the sides; the interval usually three scales wide. The 

 first black band narrow and extending from 1st temporal along the 

 anterior margins of the occipital plates to the 1st temporal of the 

 other side. First temporal may be entirely or half black. The 

 gastrosteges almost entireh' free of markings. 



Dimensions. — The total length is 36. -4 cm.; the tail 5.4 cm. or 

 6j in total length; the ga.strosteges 169; urosteges 19; anal entire, 

 but a half ga>^trostege ahead of it; temporals 1-2; the nasal divided 

 below nostril; supralabials 6, eye resting on the 2d and 3d supra- 

 lal>ials; infralabials 7; loreal point almost enters eye's orbit on the 

 left side, but is niori! remote on the right side. 



Breeding. — This specimen, taken June 20, had three white eggs 

 which were very elongate and with thin membranous integument. 

 They were, respectively, 34, 35, 35 nun. long.

 water courses. It wivs not far from the; Okefinokee Swamp that 

 Holbrook s'-cured one of his two specimens for his original descrij)- 

 tiun, namely, from Altamaha Iliver. The natives were not an.xious 

 to help us in the caj^tures of this species. 



Coloration. — The coloration is a light chocolate- or reddish-brown, 

 sometimes rusty with a series of three rows of large; sulxjuadratc or 

 rectangular spots, the dorsal row varying from 23 27 tlark brown or 

 l)lack spots before the anus and 15 IS behind the anus, the averages 

 l)eing 25 and Hi, respectively. Anteriorly, the spots are 3 4 scales 

 wide and posteriorly 2 3 scales wide. In transverse; width the larger 

 spots cover 8 10 rows of scales. .Mternating with the dorsal spots 

 is a row on either side. These; spots cover from the 1st toUhe 10th 

 row of scales. Normally, the lateral and dorsal sjiots do not touch 

 as the descriptions a.s.sert., but in almost every specimen one or two 




17J i'U(>(i;ki)in(;s ok tmk acadk.mv ok [Mar., 



sets, j)articularly in the middle of tlie body, are eonnectcd hy a 

 black line 1 scale wide. Tiie venter is white or yellowish. Hol- 

 hrook's description. "Most of them (gastroste^es) with a black spot 

 at either extremity and the centre dotted minutely with black," 

 applies to some of the younger specimens very well, and in almost 

 all the older individuals the same coloration can be discovtM'ed, 

 namely, two rows of squarish black blotches with a dusted lighter 

 line down the middle of the l)elly. Rarely, the black obscures all 

 seml)lance of pattern. The gular gastrosteges usually are without 

 the lateral spots and the whole anterior edge is black bordered; the 

 head is like the l)ody in color; the lower labials have a fine dusted 

 appearance. 



Dimensions and ]'ariations. — The specimens vary in length from 

 63-130.5 cm., all except four being over 100 cm.; in the largest 

 specimen (130.5 cm.) the tail is 30.5 cm. long and the tail is con- 

 tained in the length in the eleven specimens from 3i-5^ times, 4 or 

 4^ being the ilormal. The gastrosteges are 130-142 or average 

 135; the urosteges are G2-70, the average 67, far below the 70-90 

 of Cope and Brown. Anal plate usually divided; in three specimens 

 with a half gastrostege ahead of it and in one or two a whole gastro- 

 stege divided, otherwise this plate anterior to anal plate is entire; 

 in Xo. 6,111 the anal is entire and in No. 6,224 it is also entire with 

 a faint tran.sverse median furrow extending halfway backward 

 toward the anus. The scale rows are far below 31-33 rows, the 

 combinations being 27-27-21, 28-28-22, 29-31-22, 29-29-21 twice, 

 29-30-23, 29-30-22, 30-30-25, 30-29-22, 30-28-23, 31-31-21 or 

 in the middle of the body from 27-31— not 29-31 or 31-33 as dis- 

 covered in other members of this gomus. In fact, only two have 

 31 and only three 30 in the middle of the body. The oculars are 

 1-2; the supralabials 8, the eye resting on the 4th, except in rare 

 ca.ses when over the 4th and 5th; the infralabials 10-12; temporals 

 2-4 in eight instances, 2-5 in six and 2 3 in three cases. 



Habits. — This snake is par excellence the snake of the open water 

 courses in the swamp or narrow runs just wide enough for a boat. 

 Either along Log River or Mimic Lake Run one can hear a succes.sion 

 of pied water snakes as they droj) off into the water. They may 

 climb upon the dead branches or live shrubs which line the water 

 courses or rest on the little islets or verdant hummocks where many 

 an individual is hidden. Particularly does one find them in the 

 latter situations on the hottest days, an<l not infrequently we have 

 approached close enough on such days to club them. As they 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 173 



shoot into the water sometimes the pietl ])elly reveals that it is 

 T. taxispilotus, and not T. fasciatus or any of its subspecies. 



The pied water snakes are very large and in general very shy and 

 elusive. We had been in the swamp for 2h weeks l)efore we cap- 

 turetl our first specimens, although some of us passed them daily. 

 At first we had to shoot them as they rested in the open on branches 

 2-3^ feet above the water. Then their capture was not always 

 certain, for we often lost them because of our caution in landing 

 them. The natives are afraid of them, and whoever has wounded 

 or had experiences with this species in its wild state knows they are 

 vicious and belligerent when hard pressed. The natives call them 

 "water moccasin" and consider them as poisonous as rattlesnakes 

 or true moccasins. Once when one of us was bitten by a medium- 

 sized specimen the Lees awaited the result with considera))le solicitude 

 for the supposed unfortunate. After two weeks of attempts, we 

 were growing impatient because we had taken none of the largest 

 individuals, and "Alligator Joe," one of the visitors, when fishing, 

 stunned a "water moccasin" and consideratel}' put it in tiie |)row 

 of his boat. We had almost reached him when the snake revived, 

 and in the twinkling of an eye he had thrown his pre?<ent into the 

 lake with his oar. Man and live "water moccasin" in tiic same 

 boat was not conceivable. And there is plenty of reason for our 

 conmion respect f(jr this large water snake, which reaches 5 or barely 

 G feet. Tlic largest specimen secured measured 4| feet. Several 

 specimens in hand measure in girth from 7 <S indies, and we are 

 I)ositive w(! have seen individuals with a circumference of 10 12 

 inches. Especially is this true of the females as t he niibryos develop. 

 Then the skin is so distended that ,',; to i of an inch or more separates 

 each of the scales. 



BrecduKj. — Tlii.s species is ttvos iviparous. The specimens taken 

 in the middle of .lune showed the developmental stages little ad- 

 vanced. One specimen (Xo. (i.lKi), 2 feet 10 inches long, had only 

 14 embryos, while another, 4', feel long and about H inches in circum- 

 ference, had 40 embryos. It is rather a signilicant fact that all the 

 larger individuals taken are females. J'^ither the large; mah's were 

 too fast for us or the fenuiles are larger or occupy more exposed 

 positions and may prove? more sluggish or braver. The individuals 

 taken from .July lo November 1, 1!H2, showed the embryos nuich 

 farther advanced and some ha«l unborn embryos 2() or more cm. long. 

 (Jne specimen (No. 0,2.")()) had .").S embryos, '.V2 on the leftvside and 

 20 on the right side. The normal number .seems to be 35 40 embryos. 




174 rilOCEKDINtiS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



Food. — This animal will rat almost any animal which it finds in 

 the water or above it, provided it can swallow or capture it. One 

 specimen (Xo. 6,116) had two frop;s (liana sp.) in its stomach; 

 another (Xo. 6.2()()) had a small warmouth (Chccnobri/tlas gulosus) 

 and a third had other fish remains which were not to be identi- 

 fied. Five of the individuals had internal parasites in the stomach, 

 or about | of all the snakes so troubled were of this .species. 



12. TropidonotUS fasciatns (Linnspus): "Moccasin"; "Water Moccasin"; Southern Water 

 Snake; Baniied Water Snake. Fig. 11. 



Ten snakes not of T. taxispHotus were taken in the swamp. These 

 are so variable in coloration and also in scutellation that we hesitate 

 to add to the confusion which obtains in the interpretation of the 

 fasciatus group. Many varieties, sub.species, geographical races, forms 

 or phases have entered the literature of X'^orth American Xatrices, and 

 these are based mainly on temporal and ocular scutellation, number 

 of scale rows and coloration. These cannot all be assigned faunistic 

 or geographical areas and most of them are as yet likely to appear 

 in one region if a large series be taken. The group is very variable 

 and some of the forms designated may be variants struggling to 

 assume a stable varietal form or geographical place. As yet, how- 

 ever, this gamut of variation apparently appears independent of 

 geographical environments anrl is almost possible if not actually 

 existent in one region. Therefore, the safer and more conservative 

 course is to place them together and not take any Cratcegus course 

 until more certain of our ground. Intensive localized study and 

 possible breeding as well as extensive geographical collecting with 

 few personal equations seem the hopeful solution of the question. 



Coloration. — The smallest specimen (No. 6,227) in coloration is 

 T. rhombifera Hallowell. There are 32 dorsal diamond-shaped 

 rhombs from the vent forward. These are formed by oblique bars 

 which connect the upper angles of the lateral row of spots with the 

 alternating dorsal row. The species T. rhombifera is considered to 

 be a Mississippi Valley and Texan form, yet this specimen certainly 

 accords with Cope's and Brown's descriptions of T. rhombifera and 

 Ditmar's figure of it. Cope held that it rarely had 25 scales, but 

 Brown finds that more than half of his specimens were with 25 rows, 

 and we firmly believe 23 not out of the range of this color variation. 

 Thus, its limit clearly overlaps the supposed 23-25 range of T. 

 fasciatus. The specimen at hand has 23-23-18 scales. The venter 

 has each gastro.stege yellow with the border black. Po.steriorly, 

 each urostege is black-bordered, thus giving two rows of yellow spots, 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175 



and the under surface of the tail consequently looks darker than the 



anterior ventral region. These black borders unite on either end 



of the gastrostege and thus enclose a transverse elliptical central 



area of yellow. Also along each end of the gastrostege opposite the 



lateral spot of the side the gastrostegal black border encloses another 



small area of yellow. Thus, we have a central row of transverse 



yellow gastrostegal spots and a row on either end of smaller encircled 



yellow spots, very much like the venter of T. compressicaudus Kenni- 



cott (see description Bro\\Ti, p. 34). This species is Floridan and 



might enter the Okefinokee. Furthermore, T. conipresfn'caudus 



u-alkeri has 23 rows of scales as has our specimen. Finally, our 



specimen {rhombifer-Vike on dorsum except for the neck) has on tlie 



neck four black longitudinal bands, the two of either side l)eing 



connected posteriorly. The labials are yellowish with dark borders. 



There are no bands on the head. ]\Iany of our specimens — in fact, 



practically all — have the tail quite strongly compressed at its base and 



heavily carinated, and an examination of supposed T. f. cnjthrogastcr 



T. f. transversa, T. cyclopium and T. rhombifera material from other 



localities does not impress us that this relative character is sufficient 



to set T. compressicaudua apart as a separate form from T. fdscidlus. 



Eight of the ten specimens have no more than 23 scales, and always 



this number in the middle of the body; three having 23 23-19, 



two 23-23-17, one 23-23-18, one 23-23 20, and one 21-23-19^ 



Some of these may well be T.f. pidiventris, and were so identified in 



the field with only Cope's work at hand. This form he restricts to 



Florida, an<l he has specimens from CJainesvillc and Palatka, not far 



from the Okefinokee. He considers it close to T. conipressioaudiis 



in coloration of the belly. liut .some of our specimens clearly have 



the compressicaudu.s-pidivetilris coloration to which there is addcMl 



the reddish abdominal spots of T. fasciatus fascialus. One specimen 



(No. 0,228) has no lateral or dorsal spots apparent, the belly an 



immaculate salmon-pink, except under the tail where a bluish-grav 



enters, and the scales strongly carinated— all characters of T.fnscinlus 



erylhrfxjn.slcr. Some specimens show the lateral space with reddish 



or reddish-brown of T. f<i.scialufi fascintus. S()m(> of the ten showed 



the yellowish labials with strong black borders and most of these 



individuals have the two light dots dose to the suture of the ocdpitals. 



One specimen (Xo. (),119) is a uniform grayish or gn-enish-brown 



on the back including the head which has no postocular band, and the 



belly is whitish or yellowish-white with hardly any suggestion of 



gastrost(!gal borders (faded-out brownj. Another very large speci-

nion with a f«'\v reddish liars cvicU'iit on the sides has u yellow venter 

 with black jiastrostej^al borders not stronj;, but on the entl of each 

 gastrostejie the blue-black of the back encroaches for ^-f of an inch 

 and makes a striking; lateral border for the yellow of the middle of 

 the venter. Finally, we have another specimen (No. 6,2.'il) with 

 scales 21 2") 21 and dorsum grayish-black above. The only marks 

 eviiK^nt are transv(Tse white dorsal bands h scale wide which become 

 less distinct as the belly is reached. The entire underparts are 

 grayish-white with gastrostegal borders grayish-black. These bor- 

 ders surrounding the urosteges make two rows of encircled spots on 

 the under surface of the tail. It is, we believe, a T.fasciatus, yet far 

 from the ordinary coloration. 



Dimensions and Variations. — These specimens vary in length 

 from 28-118.7 cm., the tail from 7.9-29 cm., or 3.5-4.5, average 

 3.7 in the whole length; gastrosteges are from 123-133, the urosteges

from 67-85; supralabials 8; infralabials 10, rarely 11, sometimes 

 10-11 as in two specimens or 11-12 as in one; the temporals are 1-3 

 in seven specimens, in one of which on both sides the first temporal 

 has captured the normal third temporal of the second row; in No. 

 6,118 the temporals are 1-2; in No. 6,226, 1-2 on the undestroyed 

 side; in No. 6,225, 1-3 on the right side and 1-2 on the left side. 

 The oculars are 1-3 in eight specimens, but one of these (No. 6,116) 

 has the upper and lower po.stoculars with a strong start towards 

 su"bdivision, which if completed might give 5 oculars in all; in No. 

 6,119, the oculars are 1-2, and No. 6,231 on its undestroyed side 

 has 1-2. Thus, we see in ten specimens a strong tendency for the 

 temporal and ocular formulae to vary. The published evidence and 

 material at hand at the present date is not sufficient to determine 

 whether T. compressicaiulus and its subspecies, T. bisedus, T. fascia- 

 tus and its subspecies and T. rhombifera are other than of the T. 

 fasdatus assemblage, and thus we would be inclined to treat them

until the group is very carefully collected, bred and studied from a 

 large series from several of their supposed geographical habitats. 



Habits. — This species was not so common as the pied water snake. 

 Like it, however, this snake is called "water moccasin" by the 

 natives who fear it. One evening, one of us accidentally punctured 

 his thumb on the teeth of a recently killed snake of this species. 

 The next morning several of the native family very concernedly 

 wished to see how bad the thumb would be. Unlike the pied water 

 snake, it is fairly common on the water prairies and about the edges 

 of the islets (''houses" or "heads") of the prairies. We also took 

 this species in the water ditches on the outskirts of the swamp and 

 along the lumber railroatl ditches. We were unable to find a single 

 snake of this species along the larger water courses where the pied 

 water snake apparenth' replaces it. It seems to be more a form 

 of the moist situations on the islands and possibly in the wooded, 

 swampy parts. In disposition it is like other water snakes, but is a 

 poor second to its relative, T. taxispilotus, in pugnacity. 



Food. — It feeds largely on aquatic animals. One specimen (Xo. 

 6,116), taken May 30, 1912, had two frogs of the most aquatic species 

 of the swamp (Rana sp.) in its stomach and two (Nos. 6,231 and 

 6,115) had taken a southern meadow frog {Rnna pipiens s])heno- 

 cephala). Only one of the ten had parasites in its stomach.

Two specimens (Nos. 6,237, 6,239) were .secured between July 15 

 and November 1, 1912, by Mr. Jackson Lee, of Billy's Island. This 

 form and its congener, the red-bellied snake, are commonly a.s.so- 

 ciated with dry grounds, but certainly at some sea.sons within the 

 swamp it must finfl it impossible U) find such a habitat, and it may 

 be less averse to wet situations than once thought. 



Coloration. — Both specimens have the usual grayish-brown or 

 ash-gray (»n the u|)i)er surface with the pale vertebral line bordered 

 by black dots. The venter is white or yellowish-white in alcohol 

 and the row of dots near either end of the gastrostege is present, 

 liesides these, there are finer dots widely separated over the whole 

 belly. The neck has a ijlack band extending from the ends of 

 gastrosteges Nos. 3-5 across the angle of the mouth to the mid-dorsal 

 line where it meets its fellow of the other side. In front of this bar 

 a white band of belly color reaches acro.ss the sixth and seventh 

 infralaljials and on the sixth and seventh supralabials. 'I'he 3d-5tli 

 supralabials and the same infralabials are alrno.st entirely black.

 The dorsal head plates of body color an; with a strong sprinkling of 

 black. One specimen (No. 0,239) superficially looks almost as 

 black as the specimen of the red-bellied species did. 



DimcnfiioJis and Variations. — The gastrostcges were 1.35 and 138, 

 respectively; the urostcges 02 and 4S. The total lengths were 

 24.4 cm. and 29.3 cm.; the tails .').8 and 5.2 cm. or 4j and 5f in the 

 total length. There are 7 supralabials with the eye resting on the 

 3d and 4th; the infralabials 7; no loreal; temporals 1-2; anal plate 

 divided, in one specimen with a half gastrostege in front of it. The 

 oculars of No. 0,237 are 1-2 on l^oth sides, but on the right side the 

 preocular is almost divided into two, while No. 0,239 the oculars 

 are 2-2. This character coupled with the scales 15-15-15 in both 

 specimens raises the query whether 15 or 17 rows of scales and 2 or 1

preoculars are constant differences between S>. occipitomaculata and 

 S. dekayi as commonly held. Besides, the red-bellied specimen 

 shows greater variation in preoculars by being 3 instead of 2. 



Habits. — This species is nocturnal, spending the day beneath logs 

 and stones in rocky situations as well as in meadows. Several 

 times the authors have found it in low fields near a marshy stream. 



Food and Breeding. — The DeKay's snake is not wholly insectivo- 

 rous, as one specimen had 8 gastropods (shells missing) in its stomach. 

 One .specimen had 17 small developing eggs, 14 being on the left 

 side. Inasmuch as this was taken after July 15, this would doubtless 

 indicate that this particular specimen of this ovoviviparous species 

 would not have given birth to young until late summer or early fall.

 and November 1, 1912, after our departure. This comes well within

the range of the species. This small, largely nocturnal inhabitant 

 beneath stones, logs and other cover usualh' averages smaller than 

 *S. dekayi, and our specimen proves smaller than the two specimens 

 of the latter species taken in the swamp. The tail is lost, the speci- 

 men measuring 17.9 cm. to the vent. The gastrosteges are 120; 

 scales 15-15-15; temporals 1-2; supralabials 6; infralabials 7. 

 Unlike most of the descriptions, the ocular formula) are 3-2 for both 

 sides, instead of the 2 preocular condition usually noted. On the 

 right side of the head appears a small supranasal above the nostril 

 and at the common corner of the internasal, prefrontal and two 

 nasals. On the left side is a .similar plate not touching the internasal. 

 Other specimens from other Georgian localities (Dr. J. C. Bradley, 

 collector) reveal no such condition, and the present specimen may 

 have had some accident, although it is not especially apparent. 



The head in front of the three occipital color spots is much darker 

 than the rest of the body; in alcohol it looks black — in fact, darker 

 than any other specimen of the species we have ever recorded. 

 The characteristic light spot of the fifth supralabial is, however, not 

 wholly obscured. This specimen, like Hay's record, had a sluii in 

 its stomach and insect remains in its rectum.

One specimen was secured on Billy's Island. In the Central 

 States this .small snake extends from Minnesota to Texas, while in 

 the Eastern States its range from N'irginia southward has not its 

 .southern limit well determined. We can find no definite locus 

 beyond W. .1. Taylor's (Cope, 1900, j). 1010) record for Nashville, 

 (jla., which is 50 miles northwest of the Okefinokee Swaiuj). l)itmar.^'^ 

 gives it as extending to Florida, where it might well be, but in this 

 State Loennlierg (1895, pp. 317-339) did not secure it. 



('(>li)rntion. — The field description of the color of this specimen is 

 as follows: ( 'olor of the back with the skin bluish and scales brownish 

 or opalescent; each scale with fine speckings, which sometimes 

 assume a black eclge on the ce|)lialic end of the scale. The color of 

 the dorsal scales extends tjnto the ends of tlu; gastrosteges, fine 

 speckings accompanying it. The gastrosteges are greenish-yellow

venter of tliis adult did not impress us as salmon-colored, 'i'lie 

 total lens2:th is 228 nnn. and the tail 34 nun., or t).\ times in the total 

 length. In other specimens from other regions the short tail ranges 

 from 5^2~~i "^ the total length. The longest specimen of this species 

 we have seen reached 283 nnn. There is no particular deviation 

 from the normal in the scutellation of this specimen. The eye 

 rests on the 4th supralabial antl on the posterior end of the third 

 supralabial. The ventral i)lates are 134, the subcaudals 37. 



Habits. — This specimen was found a rod from the thick, swampy 

 cypress edge of Billy's Island. Associated with it was one of the 

 few salamanders found on the trip. The ground was decidedly 

 moist, yet the vegetation was of the pine-barren type. Inasnuich 

 as it was under the cover of a more or less disintegrated log when 

 taken (mid-forenoon), we conclude that it is distinctly a nocturnal 

 form. This specimen had no food within its alimentary tract, but 

 its habitat and previous assertions regarding its food suggest that 

 it feeds on worms, larvae of insects, etc. 



Breeding. — It is well established that this species is ovoviviparous. 

 Hay'* (p. 397) discovered a female with 5 embryos. Strecker (p. 50)'^ 

 has a specimen wnth seven embryos, and Ditmars (1907, p. 272) 

 records that a captive "gave birth to seven young on the 20th of 

 August." This lone female, secured June 15, 1912, has six embryos. 

 The.se mas.ses in length range from 15-18 mm.; in width from 6-7 

 mm. The membrane about each is practically transparent; the 

 embryo lays in the middle of one side presenting an apparent cephalic 

 and caudal yolk mass which actually on the opposite side proves 

 continuous from one end to the other. 



In this species we discovered no parasites, external or internal, 

 and of its enemies know nothing.

Ten .specimens in all were taken within the swamp. Its occurrence 

 in Okefinokee Swamp proves interesting in the light of Ruthven's 

 distribution map for this species. He considers it still a question 

 whether this species goes north of the Florida-CJeorgia line. Of it 

 he writes:^

'■'As at present knowii, the range of sackeni is confined to the 

 southern part of the coastal plain, in southern Mississippi and 

 Florida. This physically recent feature with its low altitude (nowhere 

 more than a few hundred feet above sea level) is characterized by 

 scores of stagnant rivers, lakes, lagoons and swamps. The tem- 

 perature and humidity are high and the rainfall-evaporation ratio 

 exceeds 110 per cent. (Transeau, 1905). The vegetation is rich, and 

 consists of such forms as white cedar, sweet bay, magnolia, tupelo 

 gum, swamp cottonwood, cypress, Qucrcus texana, etc., in the swamps, 

 and several species of pines on the higher ground. As far as I have 

 been able to find, the form has never Ijeen recorded outside of Florida, 

 although Ditmars (1907, p. 219) states that it is distributed in the 

 'coast regions of South Carohna and Georgia; Florida generallj'.' 

 Certainly, typical sackeni may be expected to occur somewhat north 

 of the latitude of the northern boundary of Florida, but in this 

 general region it comes in contact with sauritus, and the status of 

 the two forms in the intermediate region must be examined before 

 the northern boundary of sackeni can be even approximately fixed. 

 I must confess to have examined but few specimens from the debat- 

 able region, V)ut the fact that sauritus specimens from the coastal 

 plain from North Carolina northward show a much closer affinity 

 to sackeni than those from central Alal)ama would seem to indicate 

 that true sackeni pushes farther up the Atlantic coast tiian in the 

 interior, possil)ly into Georgia and South Carolina, as Ditmars 

 indicates, which might also be expected in view of its more aquatic 

 hal)its and its association with the coastal i)hiin coiidit'ons through- 

 out the greater part of its range." 



Coloration. — A color description of a live s])e(iinen capture(l on 

 Billy's Lake is as follows: 



The venter is opalescent with an ojjaleseent eujjpery l)ruwn on 

 the ends of the ga.strosteges. In water the two lower rows of scales 

 lof)k greenish-brassy and the lateral stripe straw-colored. The row 

 ab(n'e the lateral stripe is bordered by a line ()f black s])ecks; tlie 

 back .scales are olive and the dorsal row, iinicli like in color the two 

 lowest side rows, is defined on either side by fine black sj)ecks. The 

 <lorsal row is practically ab.sent on the caudal two-thirds of the 

 i)()dy. Hlack postocular stripe over the upper labials. Three other 

 sp(>cimens in life did not impress us as rich brown or dark as T. 

 sauritus and apinared more slend<'r. \ 



Supplementary notes of color from alcoliol and formol specimens 

 are: In some specimens, the d(»rsal stripe extends to a position 




182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Miir., 



opposite tho anus; in one individual also alonji tiu- tail; in most, 

 however, it is prominent only on the neck. Nowhere does it have 

 the color of the lateral stripes except jiossibly on the neck region. 

 When the body is distended the intervals between the scales have 

 regular light specks or lines as T. sauritus. Karely the lateral 

 stripes become more or less obscure, but not wholly absent. The 

 dorsal stripe covers the median dorsal rows and two half rows and 

 the lateral stripe is on the 3d and one half on the 4th row of scales. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The specimens vary in length from 

 31-71.5 cm. (12^-28 inches). The latter length compares favorably 

 with T. sauritus lengths, but the specimens may average smaller than 

 that species, though the average of the ten specimens is 48 cm. {l\)h 

 inches). The extreme slimness of the species adds to its diminutive 

 appearance. The tail ranges from 11.2-23.5 cm. in length or 2.9- 

 3.25 (average 3) times in the total length. The gastrosteges vary 

 from 149-159, average 154, where RuthVen's extreme begins and 

 almost coincident with his lower extreme for T. sauritus. In all 



6235 6235 6123 



Fig. 1.3. — Thamnophis sauritus sackeni (Kenn.). 



the anal plate is entire. The urosteges range from 95-114, in better 

 accord with the range of Ruthven's T. proximus and far below his 

 range for T. s. sackeni. The scale formula is 19-19-17, except in 

 one where only 19-17-17 obtains. The oculars are 1-3 except in 

 two instances, in one .specimen (No. 6,123) they are 1-4 on both 

 sides, in another (No. 6,235) they are 2-3 on the right side and 

 normal on the left; the supralabials remain constantly 8 for all the 

 specimens and the eye rests on the 4th and 5th supralabials; the 

 infralabials are 10 except in two specimens where 11 were recorded 

 on the right side. The temporals are usually 1-2, rarely 1-3; if 

 the third row be counted, it may be 2 or 3 or rarelj'^ 4 in number. 

 All in all, the relationships of T. proximus, sauritus and sackeni 

 become closer as possible intergrading localities are studied, and no 

 distinction proves so constant as the supralabial character which 

 is not absolute. 



Habits. — This attractive snake is, to our minds, even more aquatic 

 than T. sauritus, and may be found about the open water courses, 

 on the open "prairies," along the wooded parts of the Suwanee 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



River, in the moi.><t .situations of the wooded parts of the islands, if 

 not also in the dense cypress thickets. It is beautiful and is extremely 

 lithe of body. It frequents the edges of the little "houses" or i.slets 

 on the prairies, coursing among the water plants like a true water 

 snake. Of its expert swimming ability we had one fine illustration. 

 On the widest part of Billy's Lake we noticed a small snake several 

 rods ahead. It was halfway across in its course. We raced to head 

 it off, and swift and straight it did make its course. It had almost 

 reached the other shore when one of us hit at it, only to see it dive 

 deftly. It remained under water for a short time and soon re- 

 appeared on its back trail. We circled slowly towards it and when 

 near it stopped. It came immediately to the boat, apparently more 

 from curiosity than from exhaustion. This species must be accredited 

 with very gootl acjuatic skill and endurance. 



Food. — Its food is mainly small aquatic animals. In one specimen 

 were insect remains. Frogs seem to be a prominent food with this 

 species. Four of the ten had eaten frogs, one having two southern 

 meadow frogs (Rana pipiens sphenocephala) in its stomach and 

 another had one of this same species. Another snake had captured 

 the cricket frog {Acris gnjllns) and a fourth had eaten a pine-wood's 

 tree frog (Hyla femornlis), all these frogs except the last suggesting 

 an aquatic foraging ground for the species. Besides the frogs, there 

 were indications that they occasionally cat fish and other animals 

 of the water. 



Breeding. — Three specimens taken in the early part of July showed 

 the egg development to be not far advanced. One had o eggs, 

 another 8 and one 10. The numl)er of young of this ovoviviparous 

 .snake is comparatively few and must !>(' itoni in late sunnner or carlv 

 fall. 



Pnrasitefi. — This species and its relative, 7'. sirtdlis ordlndtus, wen; 

 badly afflicted by internal jiarasites. In one specijnen there were 

 parasites in the stomach, others partly in the abdominal cavity and 

 partly through the peritoneum and s^till others solely between the 

 Iieritoneum and thi' skin. In aii'ttlicr specimen these oceur in tJK! 

 cephalic region and appear from the outside lij«' large protuberances. 

 They lie just beneath the skin or imbedded in the nniscles.

The garter snake is common in the swamp, and the local name, 

 "higlihmd moccasin," indicates that the natives consider *it more 

 upland and terrestrial than the Xatriccs or Thnmnnphi.'i a. saclitni.

Coloration. — The specimens at luiml all correspond very closely 

 witli T. sirtalis ordinahis (I.imueus), thougii our use of the sul;-

 only one specimen (No. G,221). In all the others it is entirely al)sent 

 t)r indistinct. In som(> specimens the three rows of si)ots of each 

 sitle show very beautifully; on the venter the snakes are bluish-sray, 

 except for the throat and chin which are yellowish-white. There is a 

 black spot near the end of each gastrostege. In some specimens 

 the cephalic gastrosteiial borders are black and thus connect the 

 gastrostegal spot of either entl of the gastrostege. In two specimens 

 these spots are practically absent or obscured. One example, the 

 hirgest, is melanistic in appearance and the end of each gastrostege 

 and its gastrostegal spot is covered with the dark body color. In 

 all the supralabials are dark edged, but the infralabials are immaculate 

 except in two or three of the largest specimens, where there are dark 

 edges as on the supralabials. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The fifteen specimens vary in length 

 from 32.7-78.2 cm. (13-28^ inches); the tail is 7-17.6 cm. or 3t'o- 

 4^ in the total length (average 4y\); the gastrosteges have a small 

 range from 136-146, or average 141 (ten of the fifteen have 141 or 

 140); the urosteges arc 66-77, or average 70. The scale rows are 

 very constant, being 19-19-17, except in No. 6,223 where they are 

 19-19-15; the supralabials 7; the infralabials 10 except in one case of 

 11. In all the loreal is present and the oculars are consistently 1-3, 

 except in two specimens where they are 1-4 on one side; six of the 

 specimens have the temporals 1-2 on both sides, one specimen 1-3 

 on both sides, and eight specimens with the temporals 1-2 on one 

 side and 1-3 on the other side. The anal plate is entire. 



Breeding. — Of this ovoviviparous snake we took only two females 

 with embryos developing. The largest specimen (No. 6,160), taken 

 June 26, 1912, had 25 embryos or eggs little advanced in development. 

 Another small specimen had only 8 embryos <n it. From the con- 

 dition of these eggs, birth could not come Ix'fore the middle of August 

 or later as with our garter of tlie North. 



Food. — This form was found to Ije one of the most terrestrial of 

 the snakes of the swamp, both in the places where captured and by 

 local reputation and })y examination (jf their food contents. One 

 snake had eaten the small dwarf <jr oak toad (Bufo quercicus) and 

 another had two of this species. In two instances, the larger southern 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENX'ES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



toad {Bufo I. lentiginosus) proved the prey. Two others had eaten 

 the narrow-mouthed frog (Engystoina carollnense) and the pine- 

 wood's tree frog (Ilyla femoralis). In two specimens many small 

 beetles were found in the stomachs with the frogs and one had 

 nothing but beetles. All except one of the specimens with food had 

 Anura, and beetles seemed the second important food of this species. 

 Parasites. — Three of these snakes were afflicted with internal 

 parasites. The natives call this species "highland mx-casin, " 

 because of its habitat and because of its supposed poisonous nature. 

 Certainly, it is strange that in their crude waj' this observing and 

 simple people should have associated it with Tropldonotus, as they 

 surely do in calling it "highland moccasin," in contradistinction 

 to "water moccasin."

 Moccasin; Cuttun-inoutli Moccasin; Cotton-mouth; Stump-tailed Moccasin. Fig. 14. 



The water moccasin is common in the swaiii]). In the three 

 collections from the swamp we have sixteen specimens, seven taken 

 between May 29-July 15, 1912, seven from July 15-Xovember 1, 

 1912, and two taken in the fall of 1913. 



Coloration. — The smallest sp(>cimen taken, measuring 3S.3 cm., 

 shows a decided similarity to .1. contoririx in coloration, only the body 

 color is more brownish than the Hght brown or dral) of the copper- 

 head. There are thirty-two vertical bars in twos, tiiese individual 

 bars being one or two scales wide. In the cephalic half of the body 

 two l)ars of one side alternate witii two of the other side. Two bars 

 form a diamond inclosing an area of the hghter body color. In this 

 lighter area there is usually a small s])()t of color like the bars. In 

 the caudal half of th<' body the two bars of one side uwxy be opposite 

 two of the other side and unite aeros> the back, making a cross-band. 

 On the tail are seven cross-bands. The caudal half of tlu; tail, both 

 dor-uni and venter, i-; greenish-yellow in this small specimen. Tlii- 

 stage of the moccasin the natives consider another species, "thi; 

 green-tailed mocca-^in." ( )pposite the intervals between two sets 

 of bars and opposite; the sjjace inclosed by two b;irs there is on tlie 

 end of the ga^trostege a black spot \\ the width of the gastrostege. 

 In the front half of the body the black spots of one si<le of the venter 

 alternate with those of the other side. In the cauflal region where 

 the sets of bars are opposite each other as are the intervals, these 

 gastrostegal spots also are opposite, merge ami an* not so conspicuous. 

 As the snakes get older the dark ventral blotches become le.ss dis- 

 tinct and tlie yellow or yellowish-white ground color of the venter

more iloniinant. the cross-ljands of ihc hack almost ilisap]iear or 

 persist last in tlie ('('|)liali(' half of the l)0(ly, also oecasionally near 

 the anus. In all (e.\e(>pt two) of the lar<j;e siM'ciniens tjie tail is 

 perfeetly hlaek on the venter, and this usually extends ahead of the 

 anus for 20 'M) f!!;astroste«»;es; in one larjie specimen (Xo. (),214) the 

 same ventral area both alunid of the anus and on the underside of the 

 tail was merely heavily blotched with black. In the younjj; sjx'ci- 

 mens the labials are heavily marked with rich brown which is more 

 or less obscure in adults. I'sually the upper lal)ials in the adults 

 are immaculate or with few dark spots, but the infralabials retain 

 more or le.ss of the brownish markins;s of the younp; stage. The 

 postocular bro^^Tl band bordered below l)y the yellowish labial line 

 and above by a pale streak is persistent in all.

Dimensions and Variations. — These specimens vary in length 

 from 38.3-96.7 cm., the tail 6.5-15.1 cm., or usually 6 times in the 

 total length, the range being 5|-6^ times; the gastrosteges are 

 133-144, the average 141; the uro.steges 45-52, the average 48; 

 anal entire; usually the first urostege is divided, then follows 25-30 

 entire individual urosteges, with the remaining caudal ones divided. 

 The .strongly keeled scale rows range from 28-25-23 to 25-25-21, 

 in all the count being 25 around th<' middle of the body; usually the 

 supralabials are 8 in number, five of the sixteen specimens, however, 

 have variations. One has 7 on the right side and 9 on the left side, 

 two specimens 9 and 8 and two 8 and 7; the 3d and (ith supralabials 

 are largest; eye resting on the 3d, except in three instances where 

 9 supralabials occur. Then, the eye rests on the 4th, because the 

 extralabial comes in the normal second or third area, ^fhe approach

to Toxicophis pugnax B. and G. is carried even closer in several. 

 In Xo. 6,210 with 7-8 supralabials the triangular point of the second 

 labial has been forced just above the labial l)order on the right side 

 and on the left side just reaches it; in Nos. 6,213 on the left side 

 and 6,133 on the right side it enters the labial border, while in No. 

 6,129 the iK)int is just excluded from the l)order. The infralabials 

 range from 10-11, the latter number predominating. Besides the 

 inferior loreal, this species occasionally has another loreal in front 

 of the pit, as in the copperhead, and the absence of this plate is not so 

 constant for A. piscivorus as it might be thought. In No. 6,215 

 it appears on both sides cut off from supralabial No. 2; in No. 6,127 

 it ai)pears on the left side; in Nos. 6.130 and 6,132 it is on the right 

 side. Tluis, in five of the sixteen this distinguishing character 

 l)etween -4. contortrix and .4. piscivorus appears in the latter. The 

 temporals may be 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 4-5, 5-4, 6-4, 6-5. The oculars 

 are usually 2-3, though 2-2, 2-4, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4 and 4 3 also occur. 



Habits. — The "moccasin" is the C'rotaline snake of the swamp. 

 It frecpients the thickety edges of the cypress ponds on the islands, 

 occurs around tlic woodccl edges of tiie water stretches and wliere 

 the woods of the island's border meet the jiiney woods, also along 

 the water-courses and cjuite generally through the swamp. On the 

 prairies they are not so common as in the wet, woody parts. They 

 lie on the little hununocks above the water and slide in at one's 

 apjiroach. The Okefinokcc Swamp is no place for the collector 

 who Ikis been reared in harmless snake country where the nietliod 

 of capture is to step on your prey. One of the authors instinctively 

 tried it on a supposed T. t(ixisin'lotus, and fortunately just missed 

 one of the biggest of the sixteen niocetisins captured. They ar<' 

 rather sluggish, yet those who know poisonous snakes luuidle them 

 very carefully. In spite of the jjresence of so many moccasins, the 

 chiMren go barefoot. ( )n the hunting trips for l)ear and deer the 

 men of the Lee family frecpientiy travel ail day barefoot, and .Mr. 

 Bryant Lee has twice been l)itten in the large toe by a mocca-^in. 

 In such cases, usually the dogs which are ahead avoid the snake, but. 

 the hunters inunediately behind step on them, in both of these 

 injuries th<' patient's leg and part of his side sw<'lle(| to twice th<'ir 

 normal proportion-, lie recovered from both experience-;. These 

 simple j){'ople could fin<l no cure for it. and in the second case thought 

 some "('ul)an relief" i-flicacious. We suspect the ingredi^-nts of 

 this iKtstrum to be alcohol, although we are not positive of it. The 

 presence of such creatures as alligators, alligator snappers and 




188 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



moccasins do not dctrr (he f;imily fnmi swimininii. < )n(* day our 

 whole camp and the male members of the I.ee family took a swim 

 at Billy's Lake landinj?, and soon a moccasin swam from one hummock 

 to another throufih the party's midst and the snake was captured 

 as well. In another instance one of the small boys came into camp 

 with a large ilead moccasin in one hand and a live spreading adder 

 in the other. Upon in(iuiry we found that the boys went in bathing 

 in a small pool 2x6 feet near their house only to find two large 

 moccasins there before them. One they killed, the other escaped. 

 These side lights which we would think make life jirecarious shows 

 how the natives view existence in such an environment. None 

 of our specimens is more than 6| inches in circumference, but the 

 Lees assert that they reach 9 or 10 inches or even more. This 

 snake is dangerous, pugnacious and ill-natured if tormented or 

 pinned beneath a log or pushed into a corner, and care needs to he 

 i'xerci,-<ed after your game is supposedly dead, for the striking pro- 

 pensity' is one of the last to leave the reflexive dead reptile. As 

 one member of the party, a hater of snakes, said, "After it is dead, 

 give it two more licks for safety's sake." 



Breeding. — This snake is ovoviviparous Two females taken 

 June 10 and 22, 1912, respectively, each (Nos. 6,131, 6,130) had 5 

 embryos not far advanced. Another taken June 12, 1912 (No. 

 6,127), had 10 embryos in about the same stage, and another specimen 

 (No. 6,213) taken between July 15 and November 1, 1912, had 5 

 embryos, some of which were not far from hatching. 



Food. — The food of this species is considered to be fish, frogs and 

 other aquatic animals. They seek the transient pools of the islands 

 for stranded killifishes and tadpoles. One individual had a young 

 soft-shelled turtls {Platypeltis ferox) in its stomach and others 

 fish remains. The other individuals had each a frog {Rami sp.) in the 

 stomach. 



Parasites. — Several of the snakes harl in the stomach and intes- 

 tines parasites amgng the food and at other times the parasites 

 alone. In fact, only the spreading adder excelled it in the number 

 of specimens with parasites, six of the si.xteen moccasins having 

 them and these six being \ of all the snakes thus afflicted.

Coloration. — In coloration they agree very well with the descrip- 

 tions for the species, the red vertebral line being very conspicuous, 

 as are the three rows of alternating black spots of either side. The 

 venter is whitish ^\^th numerous black blotches and spots. 



Dimensions and Variations. — The measurements of the six are as

In all the loreal Ix'tween preocular and postnasal is present; the 

 ocular ring of scales from 6-9 in number; the anal entire. 



Habits. — This species apparently appears second in abundance 

 of the four Crotalids recorded in the swamp, the moccasin exceeding 

 it in abundance. It was the first form of the four to be seen and 

 the first specimen was stepped upon and calm!}' picked up l)ack 

 of the neck by one member of the party, he not being aware that 

 it was poisonous at all. 



Breeding. — Like the other poisonous Ootalids this sjiecies is 

 ovoviviparous, Ijut the number of young is few, usually from five to 

 nine being the range. One 14-inch specimen (Xo. 6,243) taken 

 between July 15-Xov('ml)er 1, 1912, has eight medium-sized (Mubryos, 

 tli(! caudal one being tiie smallest. Another, the largest specimen 

 (19 inches long), taken September, 1913, has nine embryos. 



Food. — This species is supposed to feed on frogs and field mice. 

 One individual had in its rectum the renuiins of several beetles, 

 gras.shoppers, spiders and the ribs and pieces of skin of a very small 

 snake or lizard, .\nother specimen had in its .stomach the hind 

 legs and tail of the ground lizard {Lygo.soma latcrale), the tail pointing 

 for^vard. This conforms to the rule with almost all the snakes of 

 the f)k<'finokee colleftion. In almost everv instance vertelirato

One specimen was taken durinj? our stay in the swainj). On June 



21, 1912, Mr. Jackson Lee secured it in the late afternoon in the 

 Pocket. His dojj; had discovered it and Mr. Lee "crooned" (threw 

 a chunk) it witli a chunk of wood, but the rattles were broken off 

 in the process. The specimen must have been 4|-5 feet long, f(^r 

 the length to the anus is 11.^ cm. The gastrosteges are 181; anal 

 entire; scales 29-27-21; three rows of .scales between sul:)oculars 

 and labials; seven rows between supraoculars which are transversely 

 ridged; loreal, one on the right side and two on the left side. Two 

 or three other diamond-backs were killed on the west border of the 

 swamp near Fargo while we were in the swamp. 



This largest of our poisonous snakes proves a serious economic 

 factor to the inhabitants of Ukefinokee Swamp. The Lees assert 

 that in 1910 alone they lost 10-15 head of hogs killed by this species 

 and other rattlers. In some .seasons the rattlers and bears com- 

 bined compel the Lees to go outside the swamp for new hog stock. 

 They further contend that hogs are not wholly immune, but that 

 the hogs will eat dead rattlers, preferring the heads. At other 

 times they eat the heads first and later the body, or in some instances 

 the whole snake at once. They are not so certain that the hogs are 

 such mortal enemies of the rattlers as they are reputed to l)e. In 

 some .sea.sons the rattlers are very common; during the sea.sonof 1912 

 they were scarce, as the one capture shows. They occur throughout 

 the swamp. On Minne Lake Islands they are frequent. Doul)tless 

 this is due to the infrequent visits of the swamp's inhabitants who 

 almcst invariably record them there on their hunting trips, having 

 counted as many as 14 on one expedition. On our last trip to the 

 Minne Lake Islands one of the native dogs was bitten by a rattle- 

 snake, but reached Billy's Island two days after our arrival. It 

 travelled two miles throughout the thickest swampy tangle of the 

 swamp, swam Billy's Lake and appeared with its fore leg badly 

 swollen from the bite, but it soon recovered, as they frequently but 

 not always do. 



21. Crotalus horridas Linnseus: Banded Rattlesnake; Timber Rattlesnake; Common Rattlc-

One specimen was recordetl June 25, 1912, by Prof. J. C. Bradley 

 and Mr. P. Battle on the short-cut trail to Gallijerry Island. The 




1915.] NATURAL SCIE^'CES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



.snake was about 5 feet long. In the collection made by Messrs. 

 Jackson and Lemuel Lee, July lo-Xovember 1, 1912, we have a fine 

 specimen. The other specimen was secured in the fall of 1913 l)y 

 J. C. Bradley and Paul Battle. 



Coloration. — The coloration of the larger specimen (No. 0,255) 

 is a pinkish-gray. In the cephalic end of the bod}' there is on either 

 side of the back and sides a series of three rows of alternate spots 

 for a distance corresponding to four zigzag bands. The upper row 

 of each side is separated from the one of the other side by a reddish- 

 yellow band 3 scales wide which runs along the middle of the back 

 for quite a distance until the chevron bands begin. Then it con- 

 tinues along the back between the chevron spots almost to the anus. 

 This dorsal band shows better in the .small specimen (No. 6,250). 

 Beyond the series of tlirc'c rows of alternating spots on the neck 

 region come three bands which have not the lower row of spots 

 united \vith them. Then follows 18 zigzag cro.ss-bands to the anus 

 and 4 on the tail, which is not completely black. The first of these 

 f(^ur does not completely encircle the tail as the subsequent ones 

 do. In the smaller specimen there are 5 black bands on the tail, 

 the first three not complete on the venter, and ahead of the anus 

 there are 2() baijds, six of which are not wholly united. The median 

 point of the chevron is directed backward and the angle on the 

 sides points forward, the latter point usually being on the 7th-9th 

 row of scales. The black bands are 2 scales wide and the ground- 

 color intervals 5-0 scales wide. Occasionally half black bands 

 apj)f'ar with no ccninterpart on the other side. The venter is 

 lighter than the back, yet heavilj' speckled with the grouml color 

 of the back. These specimens well agree with the so-called cane- 

 brake form of the South. 



iJimensioH.s and Vuriution.s. — The total length of the larger s|)eci- 

 men is 118.7 cm., the tail 14.5 cm., or 8j in the total length, and with 

 li rattles; anal entire; ga^trostegj's 178; the urostcges 22; scali's 

 2() 21-20; oculars 7; supralabials 14, the 4th the largest; iiifralabials 

 18 on the right side and 17 on the left side; two loreals. The smaller 

 specimen is 38.5 cm. long: the tail 3.3 cm., or 11 jj in the total length; 

 anal entire; scales 27 (23 25) 21; orbital ring 8 on one side and 

 7 on the other side; infralabials 1 I. In both specimens there are 

 three rows of scales between {\iv eye and the supralabials; the 

 larger specimen ha-s tin; first row of body scales smooth. » 



The natives described to us a large; rattler a.s large as a diamond- 

 backed rattler and called it the "Siminoli- rattler," which we pro-

PRATICOLELLA. 

 BY E. G. VANATTA. 



An oxamination of the anatomy of several United States land 

 moUusks, which were supposed to belong to the genus Pohjgyra, has 

 made it necessary to transfer them to the genus PraticoIcUa. The 

 species may i)e tlistinguished as follows: 



Praticolella griseola (Pfr.). 



Helix griseola Pfr., Symb. Hi.st. Hel., I, p. 41 (1S41). 

 Tliis is a white shell with spiral bro^vTi bands, a thin lip, and 

 obscure microscopic spiral striae upon the apex. The anatomy is 

 unknown. 

 Praticolella berlandieriana (Moric). Fig. 1. 



Jhlix illclocogeiia) berlandieriana Moric, Mem. Soc. Hist. Xat. Geneve, 

 VI, p. 537, pi. 1, fig. 1 (1833). 



A species .similar in color and sculpture to the preceding, but with 

 a very thick lip. The genitalia (fig. 1) of a specimen in the collection 

 of The Academy of Natural Sciences, No. 76,209, from Victoria, 

 Tex., collected by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, has a very long, hollow, 

 finger-shaped, somewhat glandular appendix upon the penis. The 

 verge is shorter than in P. pnchylonui ]\Ike. The penis retractor is 



divided, so that the largest branch is united to the apex of the phallus 

 and two smaller branches are attached at the base of the penial 

 gland with the vas deferens passing l^etween. The surface of the 

 interior of the verge is longitudinally plicate, while that of the 

 appendix is granular. The spermatheca bulb is oval.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



195 



Fraticolella pachyloma (Mke.). Fig. 2. 



Helix -pachyloma Mke., Zeitsch. fiir Mai., IV, p. 32 (1S47). 

 This shell is r^^A^se, t-ranslucent corneous, with a white hp and 

 very obscure micro."»on'c spiral striae on the apex. The genitalia 

 (fig. 2) of a specimen, JSo. 104,7.54, A. X. S. Phila., from Seabrook, 

 Te.x., collected by Mr. H. H. Wenzel, has a rather short, hollow, 

 finger-shaped, somewhat glandular appendix. The verge is long 



and muf'h folded. The surface of the interior of the jihallus and

THE EARLIEST SAMOAN PRINTS. 

 BY WILLIAM CHURCHILL. 



The ethnica of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition (1837-1841) 

 underwent a series of disasters of such gravity that it is sur- 

 prising that anything was preserved. The official collections, 

 known to have been of great magnitude and unrivalled importance, 

 were lost in the ^^Teck of one of the vessels of the squadron on the 

 Columbia bar in Oregon. A surrogate collection was hastily 

 assembled by Wilkes by annexing the specimens which had come 

 into the possession of officers and men. This second and inferior 

 collection reached Washington in 1842, vanished from sight for 

 fifty years and was not discovered until 1892,* when I had the melan- 

 choly pleasure of installing in the National Museum all that had 

 survived the decay of half a century. All the perishable materials 

 had by that time gone into the end-products of decomposition. 



When the squadron put into Botany Bay, after completing the 

 survey of the islands from Tahiti to Fiji, the members of the civilian 

 scientific staff were landed as a matter of convenience, while the 

 naval officers went upon their dash toward the South Pole and the 

 di.scovery of Antarctica, only recently confirmed. In the civil 

 staff was Titian R. Peale, a young member of an old and respectai)le 

 family of Philadelphia. It is through him that The Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is in possession of one of the best 

 collections of Polynesian etlmica anywhere in the world. Others 

 arc larger, but none is so seriously representative of the period before 

 foreign contamination had been introduced. The records show 

 little of the manner in which Peale's collection escaped the com- 

 mandeering by Wilkes after the di.sa.ster at the Columbia; but 

 it is evident that Peale landed his treasures when he went ashore 

 at Botany Bay and that thence he secured transport by way of 

 Lond<jn to the United States. In due course of time he (h'posited 

 these important objects with The .\cademy of Natural St-iences of 

 Philadelphia, in his home town, where now they are displayed in a 

 sati.sfactory manner and are available through the courtesy of the 

 Academy for purpo.ses of study.

Specimen Xo. lO.Cilo in the Peale Collection is a pile of small 

 basketry from Samoa, half a dozen piec(>s of the connnon envelope 

 type still in Samoan use. It is labelled "School Satchel." In 

 connection with the date, 1839, this label led inc to comment that 

 at that time it would be sonunvhat prolei)tic to use tli(> desifi;naiion 

 School Satchels, in view of the fact that the mission had then scarcely 

 -secured a foothold in Samoa. In continuation I informed the Curator 

 that basketry of that size and form was intended to hold leaf tol)acco 

 and dry banana leaves for cigarettes, for I have been assuretl by James 

 Dwight Dana that tobacco was found indigenou.s in the South Sea. 

 Handling the satchel which lay on top of the heap, I noticed that it 

 weiglied more than I should expect, and that led to my discovery of 

 printed matter contained therein. 



So far as my information extends, these pieces of printed matter 

 are absolutely unique. I have assured myself that they do not 

 exist in mission collections in Samoa, nor yet at the home of the 

 London Missionary Society; they are not in the British Museum, 

 nor can I find them of record in any library custody. It is an infer- 

 ence, but there is much to commend it, that these pieces constitute 

 a complete collection of Samoan prints up to the time of the visit of 

 the Wilkes expedition in 1839. It would appear that Peale displayed 

 an interest in the w'ork of the mission, and a natural response on the 

 part of those w'ho were laboring in that field would be to supply as 

 complete a collection as possible to show what they had already 

 accomplished. 



The following memoranda will serve to identify the several pieces 

 in necessary bibliographic detail:

202 PROCEEDIN<;S OF THE A( ADKMY OF [Apr., 



Huahine imprint. The first press in the South Seas was brought 

 to Tahiti l)y tlie London Missionary Society about 1818 on the 

 restoration of their work foMowing the faihire of tiie first scttknnent 

 of the jiarty which was sent out to Tahiti, Tonga and tiie Marquesas 

 on the DutT in 1799. The first three items in this list do not, there- 

 fore, represent the first pro(hict of the press in Tahiti, for a con- 

 siderable mass of literature had by 1837 been accumulated in Tahitian. 

 But they do sliow that wiien the need first arose for religious prints 

 in the evangeUzation of Samoa, it was necessary to employ the 

 Tahiti press at Huahine as being the only one accessible. John 

 Williams began his mission in Samoa in 1835 by a brief visit and 

 returned in 1837; it is clear that the first three items were the product 

 of his learning somewhat of the Samoan language in his first visit 

 and that on his return to Tahiti he made this provision for his perma- 

 nent settlement. 



Rarotoga imprint. A second and better press was received in 

 Tahiti in 1837 and the old machine then became availal)le for the 

 new mission in Harotonga which had ])ecn established by John 

 Williams on his way to Samoa in 1835. To this we owe items 4 and 5. 



Upolu imprint. A new press was sent out from London in 1839 

 for the Samoan mission, and the Rev. John B. Stair was detailed to 

 that field because of his knowledge of practical printing. It is not 

 imreasonable to infer that the broadside of Psalms (item 6) is the 

 first sheet run off the Samoan press, and that item 7 was the next, 

 for we note that these two items use Roman numerals with points 

 for the date and that it is not until we reach item 8 that we find 

 Arabic numerals. That the Samoan printery was fairly well equipped 

 we observe from the fact that items 7 and 8 are the only ones stitched 

 or covered in the Polynesian series. 



Vavau imprint. Less is known of the introduction of the press 

 into Tonga. Item 9 shows that it was used for the printing of 

 religious material for the mission in Fiji, which was sul)ordinate to 

 the Wesleyan establishment in Tonga. That this alphabetary and 

 fragment of the Gospel of Saint Matthew was not the first Fijian 

 product of that press is evidenced })v the fact that the l)inding shows 

 the use of wasted sheets of a former print.- 



* Included in the same parcel is an undated specimen from another linguistic 

 province. This is a small square octavo of six signatures without page numbers, 

 stitched with fiber, bound with familiar Chinese red paper. The title occupies 

 the upper third of page 1, as follows: Pinug Daanang Buhay naiig | Princesa 

 .\driana sa Caharian | nang Antioquia at nang | Principe Pantinople | sa 

 Francia. This translation of a Spanish Novelette into one of the Philippine 

 languages was undoubtedly acquired by Peale when the expedition visited the 

 Sulu Islands.

This species seems representative of Rhamdia quelen (Quoy and

 in its long adipose fin. From R. humilis (Giinther) from Venezuela,

 fin. It also differs from R. cinerascens (Giinther) from western 

 Ecuador and R. pentlandi (Valenciennes) from the Peruvian Andes 

 in similar fashion.

 says that this species is allied to Pimelodus ophthalmicus = Fimelo- 

 della cristatus. -But cristatus is generically different from Rham,dia, 

 and was generally considered so when the statement was made." 

 However, it is evident that Cope was correct in placing cyanostigma 

 in Pimelodus, as Pimelodella ( = Pseudorhamdia Steindachner) was 

 not proposed until 1888.

Only the above example. It is related to Callichthys pedoralis 

 Boulenger,'* which has been identified by Eigenmann with C. JTiel- 

 nmpterus Cope, a species certainly distinct. C. pedoralis is evidently 

 a Iloplofiternum, however, and difTors from the present species in its 

 depth 3^ to 31, large eye (though this may be due to age), inner 

 barbels half total length, and lateral plates 23 above and 22 below, 

 while in other respects it agrees. Xo description of the caudal

 its identity is uncertain. //. schreineri Ribeiro I have been unable

This example is close to Loricariichthys maculatus (Bloch), and 

 may ultimately be found identical. Bloch's poor figure-' does not 

 show much detail fit for comparison, and the synonj'mous Loricaria 

 amazonica Castelnau^ is not much better. The snout, in both cases, 

 is sho^^'n as more obtuse, similar to my examples of Loricariichthys 

 tupus. From Regan's description, my specimen differs in the 

 longer snout and the abdomen with but a single series of plates 

 between the lateral series. The carinate anterior plates are also 

 characteristic, as his specimens are given at 190 mm. in length, and 

 said to have all the predorsal plates weakly carinate in the young 

 and without distinct keels in the adult.

 No lengthwise keels on interorbital and anterior occipital region. 

 Ventral plates medianly in 3 or 4 irregular series. Lower naked 

 surface of head extends rather well i)ack on clavicle region. 



Loricaria carinata Castelnau. 



One from the Rio Maranon, 185 mm. long (caudal tips damaged). 

 Head width Ij in its length. Internasal region not elevated. Two

COLD-BLOODED VERTEBRATES FROM FLORIDA, THE WEST INDIES, 

 COSTA RICA. AND EASTERN BRAZIL. 



BY IIENHV \V. I-OWLKK. 



The Acuck'iny has received a number of small cuUectioiis from the 

 above countries during the past ten years, which I have recently 

 studied. Some include interesting records or new species, and 

 thus they are gathered together to form the present paper. I am 

 indeljted to Dr. Thomas Barbour for a review of the amphiljians 

 and reptiles listed. 



Florida. 



The most important collections from this State were made during 

 several ^^^nters, in 190-4-5, 1906, and 1907, by the late George Bacon 

 Wood, while at West Palm Beach. The marine species were all 

 collected on the ocean front at Palm Beach. ]\Ir. Wood sent piioto- 

 graphs or drawings of many of the larger and more alnmdant and 

 he also ascertained the vernacular names when i)ossible, which are 

 given below in quotations. Under date of March 26, 1909, Mr. 

 Wood wrote me of an 'example of Trachypterus recently taken 

 in a net in the sea. He says it measured 7 feet 2 inches in length 

 and was 14 inches in depth. Later this example was noted in Forest 

 and Stream, LXXII, May, 1909, p. 699, with a pliotograi)li, and 

 doul)tfully referred to as T. gryphuruH. It was not secured for the 

 Academy. 



Lieutenant Hugh Willoughby made a collection at Stuart, in 

 Dade County, in 1908. A small collection was made at Lake Kerr, 

 in Marion County, and along the St. Johns River, in 1909, by 

 Mr. John Trimble. Mr. Morgan Hebard collected some amphibians 

 in .southern Florida in 1910. In 1912 and subsequently, Mr. 0. F. 

 Baynard collected some interesting mat(;rial at Clearwater, in 

 Hillsboro County. Dr. H. A. Pilsbry obtained several species there 

 in 1904, though unless otherwise indicated, the records pertain to 

 Mr. Baynard. During the winter of 1914 Mr. F. J. Keeley collected 

 a few fishes at Hawks Park, in \'olusia County. 



Scoliodon terrae-novae (Richardson). 



Clearwater. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 245 



Sphyrua zygaena (Linnseus). "Hammer-head." 



Palm Beach. Mr. Wood reports one obtained at Boca Grande 

 Pa.«;s, thirteen feet long, which contained 35 young. Mr. Kceley also 

 reports it and Carcharias littoralis at Hawks Park. Mr. Wood 

 noted two other sharks, not preserved, Ginglijmosioma cirratum and 

 Galeocerdo tigrinus, at Boca Grande Pass, the first apparently not 

 before recorded from the east coast. I may also mention that a 

 large example of Rhineodon typus A. Smith, was taken at Knight's 

 Key on June 1, 1912, though it has already been recorded by Dr. 

 Gudger. I examined it while on exhibition, in Augu.st, 1913, at 

 Atlantic City, X. J. 



Pristis pectinatus Latham. "Saw-fish." 



Two large examples taken at Fort Pierce, and the jihotograph 

 sent by Mr. Wood. 



.fftobatus narinari (Euphrasen). "Stingarec." 



Mr. Wood obtained it at Boca Grande Pass and sent photograi)hs. 



Lepisosteus osseus (Linna?u.s). 



I have examined numerous examples in the Philadelphia markets 

 alleged to have been obtained in Florida. Mr. Triml)le reported it 

 from the St. Johns River, and al.^o Aniiatus calviis, from the 

 Ocklawaha. 



Tarpon atlanticUS (Valenciennes i. 



Mr. Wood obtained this specie-; at New River. Indian River 

 and Boca Grande Pass, and Mr. Kcdcy rcjiorts it from about 

 Hawks Park. 



During 1913, from .\j)ril 25 to May 7, Mr. lltrnum T. Wolf made 

 the following interesting measurements (in inches) from 21 examples, 

 freshly killed, from Boca Grande and ('aj)tivM P:i<s. and tiie ( 'aloosa- 

 '••iteliee.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Apr., 



In all these examples Mr. Wolf found the l)C'lly rounded, the tube.s 

 of the 1. 1. much branclied, the dorsal always inserted behind the 

 ventrals, and but few color variations. Rewrites: "River fish are 

 darker in color and may be distinguished at once: the scales are 

 yellowish or yellow, in marked contrast to the brilliant mat-silver 

 of the fish taken in the Gulf and passes. The color is not due to a 

 nuptial change, more probably a muddy-water discoloration or 

 effect of fresh water. Fishes varying greatly in weight swim in the 

 same schools. The smallest tarpon taken In these passes weighed 

 26f pounds, the record largest fish 210 pounds. It is girth and 

 condition, more than length, that controls the weight of a tarpon. 

 The best catches are made at full and new moon, day and night 

 fishing. From May 10 to the vm\ of July they are mo.st numerous 

 in the passes. Tarpon have been observed cleaning spawning-beds, 

 but no .spawn or young have l)een taken. The beds are made in 

 rivers and sheltered bays of brackish and fresh water, in the Caloosa- 

 hatchee and Peace Rivers, etc."

This brilliant species was taken in a large seine near Kingston on

 given the above notes, and also a figure of the largest example. 

 Cope originally gave a very crude figure and incomplete account of 

 the coloration. His type has been examined and compared in the 

 present study, and although greatly faded there is no doubt as to 

 the identification. Cryptotomus crassiceps T. H. Bean,^ from Ber- 

 muda, is also a synonj'm.

This species is allied, if not likely to prove identical, with Scarus 

 radians Valenciennes, as interpreted by Jordan and Evermann. 

 Sparisoma radians^ thus differs in the presence of 4 posterior canines, 

 its reddish-brown color, axil with little or no blue, but with a dusky 

 blotch partly hidden by the fin, caudal nearly plain, and one or two 

 more or less distinct whitish bars across the chin. Scarus lacrimosus 

 Poey is too imperfectly described to permit of positive identification, 

 though the pectoral is without an axillary spot. Jordan notes' a 

 specimen sent by Poey to Cambridge, which had no dark axillary 

 spot, the head plain, though it possessed two strong posterior canines 

 with several smaller pointed teeth in front. At present Sparisoma 

 abbotti has a dusky front and throat, on each side of the cheek below 

 a whitish horizontal area which does not extend across the chin. 

 Behind the dark area of the throat the scales on the isthmus form a 

 pale or whitish transverse streak completely across.

Carta<!;(). Dr. Calvert gives the following note: 



"There was an exceedingly handsome frog here, one of which we 

 took to the hotel and kept for .some days. When "asleep" its body, 

 exclusive of legs, is 63 mm. (25 ins.) long. Ordinarily the upper 

 surface of body and legs is a bright pea-green, below the body is 

 speckled white and reddish-brown, with a band of brilliant beautiful 

 blue on each side of the abdomen. We photographed it as we noticed 

 great color changes. When first caught it was pale green. When 

 we took it out of the vasculum at the hotel it was a dark dirty green 

 with pale spots on the back. While we photographed it, it grew 

 light again ^\^th paler spots over the back. After night-fall it was 

 again very dark, but although it spent the night in a dark cupboard 

 it was pale green when we first looked at it in the morning and again 

 at 4.30 P.M. When caught it secreted a quantity of sticky mucus 

 having a powerful and disagreeable odor, which it was difficult to 

 remove from the hands. It was able to cling without other support 

 than its toes on the vertical side of our glass graduate. The tips 

 of all the toes (4 on front, 5 on hind feet) are expanded into large 

 fleshy di.sks with which the frog climbs."

During November of 1913, Mr. C. F. Derby made a small collection 

 in the Rio Jaguribe at Barro Alto, in the municipality of Igatu, and 

 about 413 kilometers due .south from Fortaleza. When the fishes

 of the color. Prof. Starks states that Madeira River specimens 

 have the lengthwise lines and cross-bars more distinct than those 

 from Para. 



Poeoiluriohthys bimaculatus (Linnseus). 



Head 3 to 3^; depth 2\ to 2*; scales 32 to 35 in 1. 1. to caudal base

 1. 1., rarelj' 6; 12 to 15 predorsal scales; snout 3f to 4 in head; eye 

 2|to3; maxillary 2| to 2*; interorbital 2f to 3; length 45 to 58 mm. 

 Six examples. 



Among my earlier material belonging to this species, the specimens 

 from the Tocantins headwaters each have a cluster of dusky dots 

 at base of each lateral scale, no other dots on outer portions of 

 scales, where apparently none were ever present, and thus lengthwise 

 series of inconspicuous spots are evident. In these the predorsal 

 scales are interrupted on the anterior median line, though closely and 

 irregularly approximated, several being saddled over the ridge 

 of the posterior half. In the larger of my examples of Astyanax 

 bardettii the predorsal line is more or less interrupted, though in the 

 larger the scjuamation is mostly destroyed. The Paramarii)o .1. 

 orientali.s is pale in color, and in agreement with the C'eara material, 

 though without pigmented dots on the sides at present, and the 

 fallen predorsal scales have left pockets showing they were prol)al>ly 

 more or less comi)letely placed as saddles. A. lacustris shows th(; 

 scales of the predorsal closely approximated, though only those of 

 the posterior half formefl sa<ldles. ,4. jncnhiensis shows the pn;- 

 dorsal scales with a nearly complete naked strip in front ami without 

 the dark pigment dots, or only very faint sparse ones, at the bases 

 of the scal(! exjjosures. The body is also nnich deeper. ProT. 

 Starks mentions that Lake Extremos, Lake Papary and ("eara Mirim 

 examples have fewer anal rays (25-27), while in the Para material 

 they were more numerous (31-32).^ Of the first he says: 'These are

A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE 

 ORTHOPTERA OF ARGENTINA. 



BY JAMES A. G. UEHN. 



In the5>e Proceedings there recently appeared a paper \)y the 

 present author entitled, "A Contribution to the Knowledge of the 

 Ortiioj)tera of Argentina. "' This study was based wholly on material 

 collected by IMr. P. Jorgensen, of Buenos Aires, and sul^mitted to us 

 for study by that gentleman and Mr. Esben Petersen, of Silkeborg, 

 Denmark. Since the appearance of the above-mentioned paper, 

 several additional collections from Argentina, made almost wholly 

 b}' Mr. Jorgensen, have been received from the same persons and, 

 in addition, a small but very interesting series from Mr. Carlos Lizer, 

 of Buenos Aires. 



The comljined material represents quite a few localities supple- 

 mentary to those given in the previous paper, while thirty-eight 

 species are additional to the one hundred and sixty-two there 

 discussed. 



The total number of species here treated is one hundred and four- 

 teen, of which nineteen are now recorded from Argentina for the 

 first time, while three species are new to science. The number of 

 specimens in the present series is four hundred and fifty-eight. 



In the tabulation given on page 275 of our previous paper, there 

 can be added to the forty-nine species known in Argentina only from 

 the Misiones Territory, ten of the eighteen here first recorded from 

 Argentina. This is directly in line with the previously indicated 

 evidence of the richness and Brazilian affinity of the Misiones region. 



The forms here first recorded from Argentina are indicated by an 

 asterisk preceding the specific name. 



The types of the new species and an adequate representation of 

 the other forms in the collection have been retained for the Academy 

 series. We wish to thank Messrs. Jorgensen, Lizer and Petersen for 

 their interest and courtesy in submitting the present material to us 

 for study.

 of the other specimens examined. The female, which sex was 

 previously unknown, has abbreviate lateral non-attingent sublanceo- 

 late tegmina, much as in the North American I.johnsoni, from which 

 it can be readily separated by the slenderer build, relatively larger 

 and broader head, more transverse pronotum, more tapering tegmina 

 and shorter, more robust cerci. The measurements of the female 

 are as follows: length of body, 14.8 mm.; length of pronotum, 4.2;

 member of the genus, agreeing in havinti; the 

 ulnar vem similarly ramose toward the costal 

 margin, but differing in the pronotum being more 

 transverse elliptical with no truncation to the 

 caudal margin, in the more numerous costal veins 

 to the tegmina, in the subreniform shape of the 

 anal field of the same and in the non-annulate 

 antennae. 



8ize small; form elongate elliptical; texture of

 subtruncate, caudal margin gently arcuate, not at all truncate; a 

 distinct medio-longitudinal sulcus present on almost the entire disk, 

 the latter sublmpressed and defined caudad by a subrectangulate 

 Indentation, the surface of the disk with al)out four pairs of oblique, 

 very low strumose ridges; lateral portions of the pronotum sub-

Buenos Aires. (Lizer.) One female. 



These specimens vary considerably in size. The individual from 

 Buenos Aires is the smallest female of the species we have seen, its 

 measurements being: length of body, 52.5 mm.; length of pronotum, 

 17; greatest \\'idth of pronotum, 5.5; length of tegmen, 9; length 

 of cephalic femur, 14.1; length of caudal femur, 16.8. The form of 

 the pronotum in several is similar to or strongly approaches that of 

 the Cordillera de Mendoza individual previously mentioned by us.^ 

 In all of the present series the proximal portion of the marginal field 

 of the tegmina is opaque rufous.

Tucuiiuin, Prov. of Tucuman. March, 1911. (Jorgensen.) One 

 male. 



We refer the jM-esent sjiccimen to thi.-^ poorly understooil species 

 with a query. The fastigium is faintly tapering with the apex little 

 bluntefl, which feature is not in accord with the original description, 

 but this seems of minor importance, as there is some individual 

 variation in this respect in the group. The size is appreciably less 

 than that originally given for the sex (3| inches), but in this our 

 specimen is very close to the male from Brazil measured by lirunner 

 and tentatively referred by him to calamus.^^

From this material it is evident tiiat the species is dimorpiiic in 

 wing length, all three pairs taken in copula differing individually 

 in this respect, two pairs having the males brachypterous and the 

 females macropterous and the other pair having the male macropter- 

 ous and the female brachypterous. Of the unmated specimens one 

 male and one female are macropterous and four females brachyp- 

 terous. In the brachypterous individuals the apices of the tegmina 

 vary from straight to strongly uncinate. From the present evidence 

 it would appear that gcrmari Burmeister is merely the macropterous 

 phase of the present species, but we do not wish to establish this 

 synonymy until we are better acquainted with Brazilian material 

 of the genus. All of the present series arc <if a Ijiowuisli coloratidii, 

 some more blackish brown than others.

 there noted being the lack of dull purplish on the humeral regions of 

 two males and the but very faitit indication of it in another. The 

 La Cumbre adults are similar in form and coloration to Buenos 

 Aires individuals, but the tegmina and wings are shorter. The 

 nymphs show that the reduction of the median carina in this genus 

 is a feature of specialization, as they have it strongly elevated and 

 considerably arcuate.

Though the color pattern is very obscure in these dark specimens

 brasiliensis, in which species the color pattern is, as a result of the 

 pale general coloration, usually decidedly recessive. In the present 

 species the general coloration is bister, with intermediate channel 

 of tegmina, under parts of body and limi)s buffy, the latter flecked 

 with bister dorsad. The occiput is bister striped with three narrow 

 buffy longitudinal lines. The maxillary i)ali:)i ar(> pale, clothed with 

 dark hairs and with distal portion of terminal joint liriefly infuscated. 

 The entire lower portion of the face and lateral lobes of the inonotum

THE GENUS GRYLLUS (ORTHOPTEEA. AS FOUND IN AMERICA. 

 BY J.V.MES A. <;. HEHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



To the .systematic ortliopteri.^t, the crickets of the genus Gryllus 

 liave proven to be one of the greatest stiimbhng-blocks in the order. 

 This is true of the forms found in both hemisjiheres, but this assertion 

 has especial emphasis when the American forms alone are considered. 

 This is not tlue to a lack of study, as Scudder and Blatchley have in 

 recent years lioth endeavored to diagnose certain or all of at least the 

 North American species, using what might l)e called "conventional" 

 morphological characters, while Lutz, approaching the subject from 

 a biometric point of view, concludes that species in an anyway 

 natural sense do not exi.st in the genus, in this skepticism representing

 of species. 



The present authors have been unable in the past to approach the 

 subject with sufficient material to enable them to do more than 

 endeavor to a.ssign certain of their series to various of the forms 

 recognized by Scudder, There has been constant and increasing 

 difficulty in doing this, as, while some individuals would fit certain 

 of the specific descrii)tion"<. otliers would l)e found agreeing in various

294 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The genus GryUus is found in America everywhere from soutliern 

 Canada to Patagonia. Many forms are developed, distinctive in 

 appearance to thfterent degrees, hut possessing in not a single instance 

 valid and constant specific characters, with the exception of (rrijllus 

 domesticus, a distinctive introduced species. 



The different manifestations of the only native American species, 

 GryUus assimilis, are in no case sufficiently differentiated or constant 

 to be considered geographic races. They constitute mere variations, 

 the adaptation of this exceedingly plastic species to local environ- 

 mental conditions. All are in varying degrees unstable,' but certain 

 geographic limits naturally bound the distribution of each, thus 

 desert adaptations, such as those described as personatus and armatus, 

 are never found in the well watered portions of the continent, nor is 

 the tropical adaptation, assimilis, found in the extreme northern 

 or southern portions of the range of the species. This is of course 

 explained by the fact that the environmental conditions producing 

 these variants are not found over portions of the range of the species. 



The work of Lutz^ has already demonstrated the error of using 

 length of tegraina, wings and ovipositor as characters of specific 

 importance in the genus GryUus. The mass of evidence upon these 

 features in I.utz's paper is absolutely convincing; from studies of 

 other genera we have found such characters to be of minor importance 

 generally throughout the Orthoptera. Finding no other characters 

 which could warrant specific distinctions in the mass of American 

 material which he carefully bred and studied, Lutz has, however, 

 stated that all the forms of GryUus are conspecific. His examination 

 of the series of females of the genus in the British Museum should 

 have shown him the error of this opinion, but he apparently con- 

 fined his studies to the variations in organs of flight and ovipositor,' 



' Of these, the personatus variant, showing the maximum condition of desert 

 adaptation, constitutes the nearest ai^proach to a f?C'op;raphic racial development. 

 No intergradation is to be found with the more northern variants or with the 

 other desert adaptation, nrmalus, found also in the arid regions of the south- 

 western United States, which latter appears to be derived from the northern 

 variants, various conditions of which are found in the higher mountains every- 

 where in the region under consideration. The personalus variant, however, 

 normally very pale in general coloration, is found to be occasionally much darker, 

 and from along the Slexican borrler such specimens are before us showing the 

 transition to, and the typical condition of, the mexicanus variant.

 pp. 1 to 6.3 (1008.) 



' In length of ovipositor, however variable, different extremes are found for 

 each distinct species. For many species these differences may b(; negligible!, 

 but for some species the maximum and minimum are very different. Such features, 

 however, can only be accurately ascertained after specific units have been located 

 through the use of definite valid specific characters. Thus, in the study of females

 shorter th.in ever found in Gryllns (issimilis (10. .5 to 25.5 mm. in m.iterial stuilied

When compared with other di.stinct exotic species of the genus, 

 this insect is found to differ in the extremes of size, relative propor- 

 tions, color pattern (where this is developed, this feature being in 

 the present species very frequently lo.st through intensive coloration 

 and rarely through recessive coloration) and form of the male titilla- 

 tores. 



In Gryllus domesticus, bordigalensis and miiratus, the color pattern

is in each wholly diftercnt. Otht^r species, such as Gri/Uus desertus, 

 chi7iensis, afer and serrillei, show less striking features, but exhibit 

 a complex of characters which prove them to be distinctive forms, 

 worthy of specific rank. It would be ill advised, however, to attempt 

 detailed diagnoses of the exotic species except in a monograi>hic 

 study of the genus. 



Specific Description. — Size variable (length ranging from 1-4 to 

 2^.8 mm.^) ; form robust (two general types are developed, one, 

 particularly found in typical assimilis, somewhat more robust and 

 compact than the other, which latter is the normal condition in the 

 great majority of variants tleveloped in the temperate regions). Head 

 slightly broader than pronotum (except in a rare megacephalic 

 condition; in this there is no flattening of the face at the clypeal 

 suture as found in megacephalic males of Mio(jnjUus, and to an even 

 greater degree comprehending the entire face in males of several 

 species (jf the genus Sca])sipedus''). Pronotum with proportionate 

 length of disk somewhat variable, but with this dimension usually 

 contained in the width about 1.4 times, caudal margin of disk straight 

 to distinctly bismuate, lateral lobes with ventral margin straight and 

 horizontal, or occasionally weakly declivent ccphalad, ventro- 

 cephalic and vcntro-caudal angles rectangulate, the former rather 

 l)roadly rounded, the latter more decidedly so, the caudal portion of 

 the lateral lobes is somewhat pressed inward, particularly ventrad. 

 In length the tegmina vary from less than half to fully the al)- 

 dominal length, in scjme phases their apices are situated externo- 

 laterad. though normally mesad. The wings are either develoix-d as 

 complete organs of flight (ihougli never to the extent found in the

species of MioijryUus) or are greatly reduced, though perfect and 

 concealed by the tegniina^ (when greatly reduced in Mioijri/UKS, the 

 wings constitute small rounded flattened pads, not folded as in the 

 niacrojiterous condition, and may be termed vestigial rather than 

 reduced). The transverse veins of the male tegmina are normally -i, 

 sometimes 4 (particularly in some South American series where this 

 number is the normal), rarely 5, and very rarely 2 or 6; the speculum 

 is broadly ovate, l>ut somewhat variable in outline, with normally a 

 curved vein dividing it into nearly equal sections. The number of 

 branches of the mediastine vein is variable in the present species and 

 useless as a specific character. The caudal tibiae have the dorsal 

 margins armed normally with 6 or 7 heavy rigid spines (the number 

 of these spines is seldom 5, except in a very few series and very rarely 

 8 or more'), the distal spurs are 6 in number, the medio-external, 

 medio-internal and dors6-internal being . decidedly the longest, of 

 which the medio-internal is normally slightly longer than the others, 

 equalling slightly more than h to f the length of the metatarsus. 

 The male titillatores are very different from those found in either 

 Gryllus doynesticus or Gryllns mitratus, with which species we have 

 alone been able to make this comparison. This organ is found 

 within the subgenital plate of the males of this group and constitutes 

 the repository of a small globular seminal sac which rests upon the 

 subgenital plate, but is enveloped laterad and dorsad by the thin 

 but corneous organ, the parts of which afford the diagnostic features 

 described below. This corneous portion constitutes a thin complex 

 plate, .semi-circular in transverse section and composed of a medio- 

 dorsal and two lateral parts. The first of these is produced mesad 

 in an upcurved, rather narrow, triangular plate, with margins weakly 

 convex and with length nearly I5 times the basal width. The 

 lateral, nearly perpendicular, portions are fused with this portion 

 dorso-proximad and are produced in shorter, narrow, vertical and 

 blunt projections, inside of which from their proximal point of 

 juncture with the dorsal portion extends on each side a single finger- 

 like projection which is also corneous and is slightly curved toward 

 the apices of the lateral projections which it almo.st reaches, (See

Treatment of the Specific Variants. — In order to place properly the 

 material of this .species examined, we have found it quite impossible 

 to group the specimens under any number of varietal units, and in con- 

 sequence we have devised a system of symbols as <iiven below, by 

 which the coloration, color pattern, tegminal and wing development 

 and size of each specimen recorded at the end of this treatment is 

 defined. We have found that in general certain types do jiredominate 

 over certain regions. These constitute the l)ases of many of the 

 supposed species, but in our opinion should be characterizetl by 

 symbols rather than varietal names, owing to their complexity and 

 the evident fact that none of these are distinct either specifically or 

 as geographic races, and really show only the various phases resultant 

 from varied environmental conditions. In other widely distrilMited 

 and plastic species we have found similar environmental adaptations."' 

 but nowhere in the Orthoptera of America is this carried to the 

 multiplicity and extreme diversity of such variants as in the present 

 species. Should varietal names be used without fiualification for 

 such units, even for convenience, the frecjuent and varieil combina- 

 tions of features, already proven worthless for either specific or 

 geographic racial distinction, would jjreclude the possibility of projxT 

 use of even such names of minor importance for many specimens in 

 every large series studi<'d.

The most frequently encountered variants of Gryllus assimilis. 



We would again caution the student that these variants are in 

 no case fixed, all manner of interminj^ling is found in large series and 

 the use of names to designate such is not warranted, as such use 

 would on many occasions unquestionably result in conveying a 

 false impression to subsequent workers. 



C, greatly .sufTu.sed Z, (normalh' a or b, u) 012. assimilis Fabricius. 



This variant is widely distributed throughout tropical humid 

 America at low elevations and throughout the West Indies. In the 

 United States it appears only along the coast of extreme .southern 

 California. Though many series are quite uniform for this plastic 

 species, .specimens before us from Duran, Ecuador, show to varying

 names: aibensis, aztecus, galapageius, barretti. 



D, suffused Z, (normally d to f, v) 3 (often weakly 0). mexicanus 

 Saussure.'^ 



This variant is widely distril:)uted over Mexico and Lower Cali- 

 fornia, it is the development toward an arid adaptation of the assimilis 

 type and shows great varial)ility. In the United States occasional 

 individuals show a tendency toward, and a few specimens are typical 

 of, this condition in our series taken along the Mexican border of Texas. 

 In thi? variant the pronotum has the dorsum frequently narrowly 

 bordered laterad by pale yellowish. Other naifte: chichimecus. 



EZ, (normally d to g, u), 2 (often weakly 0). personatus Uhler.*- 



This variant, a desert ada]itation. in which the extreme of recessive 

 coloration and most strongly defined color pattern is reached, is 

 known only from the United States from Kansas, Colorado and 

 central Texas westward. Of all the variants of the sjiecics this onv 

 shows the m(jst tlecided indications of a geographic race in process of 

 evolution. It is interesting to note that this variant averages decid- 

 edly heavier than the other desert adaptations of the species found 

 in the southwestern United States. (Jther name: StAl's much older 

 name, linealiceps, appears to represent a transition lietween this and 

 the mexicnniis variant. 



A, suffused Z, (normally d to g, u), 3. nrtnatiis Scuddcr. 



In the same regions of the .southwestern United States in which the 

 permimln.s variant is founrl, the present variant also occurs, often very 

 conspicuous on account of its dark head and pronotum which contrast 

 strongly with the much paler remaining portions of the in.sect. 

 Great variability is shown in the series before us, many dilTerences 

 being found in individuals of ever}' large series, but none showing any 

 approach to the personatus variant. Immature individuals of this 

 variant might be mistaken for those of Miiuiri/llns liiuntus; tlx'y have, 

 however, the alidomen broadly infuscatecl, giving them a burred 

 appearance, while the spines of the dorsal margins of the c;iiid;il 

 femora are rarely less than (> in numl)er, in .U. tinnitus normally .'),

in tlu' nortli not largo or robust {scuddcriduufs, 45), but in Florida 

 larjicr anil more robust {Jirmus, 2 weakly 0). It is an a(lai)tati()n 

 to arenaceous surroundings in these regions. Immature indiviiluals 

 couUl easily be confused with those of MiognjUus verUcalis,^^ but in 

 that sjK'cies the young are more regularly marked with darker colors 

 and normally have 5 spines on each dorsal margin of the caudal 

 femora. Other names: rubcns, Jirmus, arcnaceus. 



\V, (.normally ax) 4. neyledus Scudder. 



This is the darkest variant found in the present species, the maxi- 

 miun development of the condition found also in the two following 

 variants. It is foifiKl in the northeastern portion of the insect's 

 distril)Ution, ranging southward in the high Appalachians to northern 

 Georgia and is known from the Piedmont Plateau only*m Pennsyl- 

 vania. Much variability exists and every intergradation with the 

 next two variants is often to be found in the same .series. 



AV, (normally a or b but ranging to f, x but often u), 3. pennsyl- 

 vunicus Burmeister. 



This is the dominant variant of the species in the well watered 

 regions of temperate North America and is found southward to the 

 Gulf coast of eastern Texas. Great variability is exhibited and 

 every intergradation wth the variants termed neglectus and luctuosus 

 is to i)e found. Other names: nigra, angustus. 



AW, (normally d but ranging from a to f, w but often u), 3. luc- 

 tuosus Serville.^^ 



This variant shows an intensification of the features of the last. 

 It is found throughout the lowlands of the southeastern United States 

 and in the Middle West from Manitoba southward to the arid regions. 

 It also exhibits great variability. The maximum of this condition 

 is found in material from the pine woods of the southeastern United 

 States. Other names: abbreviatus. 



AXW, (normally a, u but often w), 3. integer Scudder. 



This Ls an adaptation found in the mountains of the arid portions 

 of the southwestern United States and also in California. Extreme 

 variability is to be found. Other name: vocalis. 



Our series are not sufficiently numerous from temperate South 

 America to show as definitely the variants there developed; quite as 

 many probably exi.st as found in North America. Of these fulvi- 



" Under thi.-j name of Servillc-'s will be ff)Uiid hoih biplnUn .Saiis.sure and saussurei 

 Scudder. See Hebard, Jour. N. Y. Ent. Soc, XXIII. (1915.) 



" This is the variant which the authors have previously consistently recorded 

 as rubens from the .southeastern United States.

pennis appears to be an adaptation similar to the pcnnsylvanicus 

 variant, l>ut heavier, though no more compact, with larger head; 

 under argentinus appear to be described numerous adaptations, though 

 typically suggesting the luduosus variant with tegmina f. Saussure's 

 anjentuuis variety c is, however, an adaptation similar to the per- 

 sonatiis variant, but with color pattern scarcely developed. 



We have not referred to Walker's names here, as the majority have 

 already been proven .^^ynonyms and the descriptions are worthless. 



We feel certain that the other described South American species 

 have no further significance than the North American variants 

 discussed above. We have noted that in the mountains, particularly 

 those of arid or semi-arid regions, a degree of plasticity is found 

 greater even than exhibited elsewhere by this most plastic species. 

 Several South American names are doubtless applicable to such 

 manifestations of the species. 



Females, as a rule, have the tegminal and femoral markings more 

 decided than in the male sex, thus frequently in the same series the 

 males will show VWa, while the females will average Wb. 



As in our other recent papers, the material collected by one or 

 both of the authors is understood to be in The Academy of Natural 

 Sciences of Philadelphia or Hel)ard Collection.

 [Europe, in walls of hou.ses.] 



The present species is readily distinguished from all manifestations 

 of G. assimilis by its more slender form and distinctive color pattern. 

 The titillatores of the male are also distinctive and may be described 

 as follows: the corneous portion con.stitutes a thin plate, semi- 

 circular in transverse section, with distal margin weakly produced 

 meso-dorsad and broadly obtuse-angulate with weakly concave 



" Recorded by Rehn as Gryllus argenlinus.

sides; below the ventro-lateral margins of this portion on each side, 

 rests a somewhat more thickened, narrow, corneous plate which is 

 exteriorly nearly horizontal at the base, but produced and upcurved 

 with blunt apex reaching a little distad of the apex of the dorsal 

 portion, inside at the juncture with the dorsal portion this ventro- 

 lateral portion is strongly concave thus forming claw-like projections 

 which hold in the seminal sac without pressing upon it at any point. 

 (See Plate IV, figs. 11 and 12.) 



The species has been accidentally introtluced Ijy man from Europe 

 and is now widely di.strii)uted through temperate North America. 

 It has in the past been recorded from Montreal, Quebec; Connecti- 

 cut; New York, New York; New Brunswick, New Jersey; Ohio; 

 Lexington. Kentucky; West Terre Haute, Indianapolis and Putnam 

 County, Indiana; Moline and Urbana, Illinois; Minnesota, and 

 Omaha, Nebraska. 



The insect inhabits dwellings, greenhouses, etc., where it is some- 

 times found in large numbers. The species is decidedly more alert 

 and active than assimilis, in its movements more nearly resembling 

 the extremely rapid Gryllodes sigillatus, which tropical species also 

 appears to prefer the proximity- of man. 



The series recorded below are in general coloration yellowish brown, 

 the specimens from Chicago, Illinois, and Albany. (Jeorgia, are 

 slightly tlarker than normal with caudal femora weakly suffused. 



Specimens Examined: 27; 7 males, 14 females, 2 immature males

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, VI: THE HACHETA GRANDE. 

 FLORIDA. AND PELONCILLO MOUNTAINS. NEW MEXICO 



BY HENRY A. PIL8BRY. 



I. The J^k; Hachet Mointains. 



The Big Hachet (or Haelietu (iraiule) Mountains are a short 

 range in southern New Mexico in sight of the Mexican Ijoundary. 



They may be reached from the station of Hacliita, on the El Paso 

 and Southwestern R. H., where provisions can be obtained. Water 

 must be hauled in, unless the prospecting in progre.s.s at the time of 

 our visit resultetl in a successful well. Th^re are no trails in the 

 mountains. The extreme northern end of the range remains to be 

 worketl conchologically, as we could not reach it from our camp. 

 A visit should be planned much earlier or later than ours (August), 

 in order to have the advantage of what ruin there is and also to 

 avoid the excessive heat. 



The highest peak, Hacheta Grande, has an elevation of about 

 8,500 ft., and is con.siderably higher than any other in the group. 

 Several large canyons dissect the range, two of them forming broad 

 basins. 



There are no springs in the range, but sometimes after the infre- 

 quent rains a little water remains for a time in rocky basins in narrow 

 canyons. We found one such hole ('(jntaining al)out half a l)arr('I. 

 It was foul with drownetl insects, yet mcjst welcome, as our canteens 

 were dry, towards the end of a two-day trip to Big Hachet Mountain. 



The colonies of snails here as in other desert mountains are usually 

 of small area. As the mountains are uninhabited and too dry for 

 cattle ranges, there are few local place names and no roads or ranchrs 

 to aid in locating collecting points. In the absence of any topo- 

 graphic map, wr reproduce a rough map made from our Held notes, which 

 shouhl enable anyone to exactly locate nearly every colony of snails 

 fount I. For convj^iient reference we have named .several promi- 

 nent landmarks, such as Daniels Mountain,' the highest peak north- 

 ward as .seen from Sheridan Canyon, and Teocalli Hutte, west of our 

 camp, both being inhabite(| by special races of snails.

Tilt' Big Haclu'ts arc witliout tiinlx-r. Only the higlirr jieaks 

 are in the pinyoii zone. There are some scrubby cedars and old 

 gnarled pinyon jiines. nowhere numerous. On some of the higlier 

 slopes of Hacheta Clrande Mt. there is a growth of very small scrul) 

 oak. sometimes so close as to impede travel, as it is mingled with a 

 l>road-leaved, black-s])ined agave. Elsewhere a small agave with 

 white filaments is very al)undant. There is also an agave zone 

 surrounding the mountains, boundetl outwardly by the zone of giant 

 yuecas, both usual on the slopes lea<ling to the mountains in this 

 part of New Mexico. South of Daniels Peak the higher hills and 

 buttes usually have Fouquieria and its characteristic society. The 

 rock is hard limestone worn into holes and points, and containing 

 few ill-preserveil fossils, among which a Znphrcutis-Vike coral, 

 crinoid stems and a spiral univalve are most abundant. Rattle- 

 snakes, large centipedes, tarantulas and small bro^^^l scorpions are 

 reasonalily abundant. Birds and mammals are scarce, and owing 

 to the absence of springs, the mountains are not available for cattle 

 range. During the time we were there (August 20 to 26, 1910) the 

 heat was intense from sunrise until after 9 P.M. Sky cloudless until 

 midday, when small clouds gather, possibly covering 10 p. c. of the 

 sky. There was very little wind. The annual rainfall is not 

 known, but must be less than 9 or 10 inches, recorded from the region 

 immediately northw^ard. 



Previous to the visit of Mr. L. E. Daniels and the writer, in 

 August, 1910, the moUusks of these mountains had been collected 

 by Dr. Edgar A. Meams, U. S. A., while serving on the survey of the 

 Mexican boundary. 



Dr. Meams started from Mesquite or Mosquito Springs, Chi- 

 huahua, 6 or 8 miles east of the mouth of Sheridan Canyon. Enter- 

 ing Thomson Canyon, he turned southward to get a practicable grade 

 for mules up the .steep ridge terminating in Daniels Peak. Passing 

 near or over the summit he camped at its north end. From here his 

 route lay along the ridge to the summit of Big Hachet Mt.; thence 

 eastward to near our Station 9, south pa.st our Station 8, and l)ack to 

 camp, as plotted on the map, where his route is approximately indi- 

 cated by small crosses.^ On this trip collections were made ])etween 

 camp and the first rise indicated on the map, on the out-journey to 

 the peak, and somewhere between our Stations 9 and 8 on the return. 



* We would here acknowledge Dr. Meam.s' kindness in plotting his route on 

 our map and giving the above details of his visit. From the data it is now 

 easy to determine the tj-pe locaUties of the species he found.

Dr. Mi'arns rt'turntHl to Mesquitc S])rinp;s along the ridjiv running 

 from Daniols Mt. towards our camp in Slu-ridan Canyon, and along 

 the wash running out of this canyon. 



Dr. Mearns found the following seven species, whicii were deter- 

 mined by Dr. Wm. H. Dall:^ 



Patula strigosa Gould, var. concentrala Dall. [Specimens reported 

 from summit of Hacheta Grande = Orco/?e//x hachctana.] 



Epiphragmophora hnchilana Dall [ = SonorcUa hochitana]. 



Polygyra meonisii Dall [ = Asf7nuneU(i incarnsi]. 



Thymnophora hornii Gabh. 



Hohspira crossei Dall. 



Holospira bilaniellata Dall. 



Holospiro 7nearnsi Dall. 



The relationships of the Big Hachet fauna are closest with tiie 

 Florida and Organ ranges. Near related species of Sonorella and 

 A.-<hmHncUa inhabit these three ranges, and Sonorellas very close to 

 hochitana have been found in the Carrazolillo and Peloncillo Moun- 

 tains. The Oreohelices stand nearest to Chiricahua species. The 

 Holospims and Vallonia are special to the range, but the other small 

 .shells are common to most mountains of southern Arizona. 



Holospira is the most generally distributed snail in these moun- 

 tains. Its abstemious nature is evidently satisfied with the scanty 

 moisture supplied by the rare rains and light snow, which is said to 

 whiten the mountains for brief periods in the winter. No doubt 

 a great many colonies and other local races of Holospira remain to 

 be found. 



Holospira lives only where there is limestone. We never found 

 but one colony on igneous rock, and this was on a dj^ke in a limestone 

 region. They are usually found on the hot slopes, east and south, 

 where other snails are. totally absent or very rare. 



The subgenus Radiocentrum of Oreohelix is represented by two 

 new species, making five now kno\Mi. The new forms agree in 

 genitalia and sculpture of the embryonic shell with those already 

 known. In the large number examined" no embryos were found, 

 so that there can be very little doubt that the species of this group

< Besides di.s.secting .several individuals each of four of the species, we have 

 pulled hundreds in cleaning the .shells, without finding any embryos. Among 

 ordinary Oreohelices it is rather exceptional to find un individual not gravid.

As this species is type of the genus Sonorella,^ the investigation 

 (»f its soft anatomy had Ijecome a matter of importance, and to 

 obtain hving material was one of the chief ol)jects of our quest in 

 the Hachetas. 



We found it at Stations 7. S. 10 and 1 1. .Vll of these stations are 

 near or on Dr. Mearns's route to the sununit of Hacheta Grande. 

 Station 7, on the western slope of a hill at the head of the northern 

 branch of Western Canyon, was the most prolific locality. Here 

 the Sonorellas may he found in some numbers under large stones 

 on the steep slope near the hill-top. where there is some shade from 

 the pinon pines. 



Twenty-one adult shells from this .station measure as follows: 



2.3 23.. 5 21

The shells vary somewhat in the degree of ddlection of the last 

 whorl, but very little in other respects. The last whorl descends 

 more than in most related species. The color is pale fawn, fading 

 to whitish in the middle of the ba>^e, and having a cinnamoUTbrown, 

 shading into chestnut-brown, band above the periphery; this band 

 is bordered with white on both sides. The aperture is rather small, 

 its gn-atest diameter (including peristome) being 50 to 54 per cent, 

 of the diameter of the shell. 



At Station H only dead shells were found, but the.<e are tnore 

 varial)le in size, the extremes in a lot of S measuring:

At Station 5 two hrokcu t'xaini}lc'.s, 

 much weathored, were dug out of the 

 soil. Though practically adult, the 

 largest measures only 18.2 mm. diam- 

 eter, the shell being quite as solid as 

 in large individuals. It was prol)al)ly 

 dwarfed by the arid conditions i)e- 

 fore it became extinct in this place. 



The genitalia are remarkal)le for 

 the small size of the male organs. 

 The penis is very slender, diameter 

 1 mm., tapering downward, and en- 

 circled at the base by a short sheath. 

 The penis-papilla is very slender, 

 gradually tapering, and annulate. The 

 retractor muscle is terminal, long and 

 slender. Epiphallus a little shorter 

 than the penis. The vagina is slightly 

 longer than the penis. Other organs 

 as usual. Measurements of the organs 



of two individuals are given in the following table, with those of 



allied forms for comparison.

In my former work on S. hachitana (1905) I referred shells from the 

 Organ and Florida Mountains and from central Arizona to S. hachi- 

 tana, which at that time was not known anatomically. While it 

 must be admitted that the shells are very similar, I find differential

anatomical characters, which, though not great, seem to be constant 

 in a considerable number examined, and which favor the more 

 analytical treatment of the hachiinna group effected l)y Dr. Bartsch. 

 — a view I formerly opposed. After examining many fresh specimen-^ 

 from both ranges, I separate^ the Florida and Hacheta Sonorella- 

 subspecifically. 



Whether the typical form of .S. tiachitana occurs outside of the 

 Big Hachet range is doubtful. The Peloncillo range SonoreUa 

 (S. h. pelonciUensis) is not easily distinguishable by the shell alone, 

 but the proportions of the genitalia differ. 



On the Carrizolillo Mts., top of two peaks near the boundary 

 line, numerous "bones" were collected by Dr. Mearns (No. 12(», .')'.»(). 

 U. S. X. ]\I.). They agree with S. hachitana in the rather wide 

 imibilicus, small aperture and deeply descending la-^t whorl, but 

 differ l)y the average smaller size, from alt. 10.8. diam. 19.3 mm., to 

 alt. 12.4, diam. 21.4 ram. It is apparently a small race of hachitann. 

 The locality is about 30 miles ea^^t of Big Hachet Mountain. 



Specimen"^ reported as .S. hachlUnia from the Chiricahua Mountains 

 will doubtless turn out to be one of the .species already described 

 from there, r^everal resemble hachitann more or le-;s in the shell, 

 but all differ in genitalia.

 near the summit, with //0/o.s/xw bilameUala. Also at Stations 7. 10 

 and 11. the hitter at tiie summit of Haeheta (Jrande. 



Tlie specimens from Station 5 (not far from the site of Dr. Mearns's 

 camp) agree well with tlu' orij:;inal specimens, description and figure. 

 rsually the parietal callus is raised from the surface as a thin, straight 

 hmiina, and in almost all of them the edge is more d(>finite than in 

 shells from other stations. The axial end of the parietal lamella 

 is al)rui)tly bent towards the columella antl is more or less tubercular; 

 Rarely the tul)ercle is almost free from the lamella. The spire is 

 occasionally almost flat. The color in shells taken alive is translucent 

 sayal brown. The diameter varies from 11.5 to 14.5 mm. 



In specimens from the sunnnit of Haeheta CJrande the i)arietal 

 lamellae are a little shorter; the axial end of the longer branch is 



often .straight, but more fre- 

 quently is In'ut, t)r the bend is 

 rei)resented by a tubercle con- 

 nected with, or almost free from 

 the lamella. The edge of the 

 l)arietal callus is appressed to the 

 surface, and is often arcuate. 

 The aperture varies in obliciuity, 

 as the figures show. 



The iienis is .stout, i)ipartite. 

 The epiphallus is stronglj' con- 

 voluted just beyond the insertion 

 of the retractor muscle. It is 

 very long. No flagellum seen. 

 The spermatheca is largest in the 

 middle, thin-walled. T>ength of 

 penis 4.5 mm.; epiphallus 30 

 mm. ; vagina 4 mm. ; spermatheca and duct 19 mm. 



A. mearnsi lives in the earth under stones, like A. walkeri in the 

 Floridas, both being burrowing species. It is closely related to 

 A. kochi Clapp and A. walkeri Ferriss, but quite distinct from both. 

 A. levettei bifurca in the Huachucas is a less depre.sserl sliell with

The species is very uniform in .all its characters. The size varies 

 from 14 to 16 mm. diameter, and in .some shells the last whorl descends 

 more than in others. \'ery few have the parietal callus thickened 

 and a little raised. It differs from all forms of 0. strigosa by its 

 convex, radially costellate embryonic whorls, but in many adult 

 shells this sculpture is effaced. 0. ferrissi is prol)ably the most 

 nearly related species, though very different.

The shell is openly umbilicate, umbilicus conic, over one-fourth 

 the total diameter; slightly convex above, base strongly convex; 

 thin, light dull brown. The embryonic shell of 1^ convex whorls 

 is finely lamellose striate radially (fig. od). Post-embryonic whorls 

 have the surface densely lamellose along growth-lines, the lamellae 

 rising in triangular cuticular processes where they cro.ss the spiral 

 ridges of the shell. When denuded, the shell has a blunt, projecting 

 peripheral carina; the upper surface has a wide, somewhat angular 

 spiral ridge upon all the post-embryonic whorls, sometimes with one 

 or two minor ridges; the lower surface has three to five low spiral 

 ridges and some minute, weak .spiral striae; the whole .shell being 

 closely thread-striate along growth-lines. The last whorl usually 

 does not descend in front. Aperture oblicjue, irregularly rounded, 

 lip simple, the margins rather widely .separated, parietal callus thin.

O. ferrissi has much the appearance of the Chiricahuan 0. barbata 

 Pils., but this resemblance is superficial. When denuded of the 

 cuticular fringes, the two are quite different, the Chiricahuan species 

 being much smoother, ^^^thout the strong spiral ridges of 0. ferrissi. 

 Moreover, the sculpture of the embryonic shell is different. The 

 .shape of penis and epiphallus in 0. ferrissi is like 0. chiricahuana 

 and 0. clappi, both organs l^eing enlarged distally, while in 0. barbaUi 

 the lower half of the penis is enlarged, the distal portion slender. 



In well-developed shells the last whorl scarcely descends anteriorly, 

 the upper margin of the lip being inserted on the peripheral carina. 

 In some of the smaller adults, diam. 13 mm., the last whorl is bent 

 downwards; the upper and columellar margins of the lip converge 

 and are connectetl by a raised parietal lamina, the mouth having a 

 somewhat triangular contour. The.se are to be regarded as decadent 

 (gerontic) individuals. 



At Station 1, Teocalli Butte, the shells are all convex above, witli 

 a noticeably smaller umbilicus. The largest measures, alt. 7.8, 

 diam. 15 mm., with 5 whorls (PI. VI, fig. Ab). This small colony is 

 probably extinct or nearly .so, as no living shells were found. 



Our Station 3 is on ledges of high cliffs facing the mouth of Sheridan 

 Canyon, and especially on a bench about half-way up. Here Ferriss's 

 Oreoheiix lives on an almost inaccessible cliff looking out over the 

 mesa into Mexico. There is little vegetation on the ledges. On 

 tli<' talus slope below the cliff there is a growth of dwarf oak about 

 knee-high, charming big wild roses of a species which we saw nowhere 

 else, Cylinrlrftpnntia, Opunlid, l)isnaga.s, etc. On top, above the cliffs, 

 the Fouquieria, .sotol, mescal society is found. The Oreoheiix colony 

 is of small extent; the ledges where they were observed living are 

 probably not over a couple of .s(juare rods in area, with perhaps an 

 equal area on the talus below the cliffs, where (l«'ad shells werr found. 

 These estimates are from mennjry, as I neglected to note the figures 

 at the time. 



The locality on the east side of Teocalli Huttr is more rrvtrietcd, 

 and if possible more arid.

UROCOPTID^. 



The study of a very large series of Hachita Holospiras has fully 

 confirmed the results reached in our study of Chiricahuan species, 

 that the number of internal lamellae is variable in each species and 

 colony, among perfectly mature or even aged individuals. They 

 vary in a way it was impossible to foresee at the time when Holo- 

 spiras were so rare that only one or two of a lot could be opened. 

 Very naturally, the number of internal lamellae was thought at that 

 time to be of specific and even subgeneric value. 



In some colonies it appears that the large.st shells have in the 

 average the greatest development of lamellae, so that it might be 

 thought that only the most vigorous individuals attain the full 

 number; yet other races or colonies give a contrary result. No 

 external character is correllated with the number of lamellae. Usually 

 most of the shells of any one colony resemble each other in size, 

 shape and .sculpture, so that each lot has a certain individuality, 

 though all of the characters vary more than is usual among the 

 land .snails. We have never found two species of HoloHpira living 

 in one colony, either in the Hachitas or in any other district, in the 

 course of several years, collecting, in many places in Texas, New 

 Mexico and Arizona. 



A comparison of the Holospiras of the Hachita Grande range with 

 those of the Chiricahua range shows some interesting resemblances 

 and differences. In both localities the internal lamella? present (in 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



almost ever>' form known by large lots) may be (1) Superior, axial 

 'and basal, or (2) axial only. In Hachita forms we have also the 

 combination (3) axial and basal, which is never found in the Chirica- 

 huan series, where it is replaced by the combination (4) superior 

 and axial. Every Hachita species has, therefore, in tlifferent speci- 

 mens of the same colony, the characters of the supposed subgenera 

 or sections Bostrichocentrum, Haplostemma, Distomo.^pira, and Tri- 

 stemma, while a Chiricahuan species will belong to Bostrichocentrum, 

 Eudistemma, and Tristemma. In external form and sculpture there 

 are no differences greater than sjx'cific between tlic Hachita and 

 Chiricahua species. 



The Hacliita Holospiras belong, if we accept the criterion (jf 

 intergradation, to only one species, for which the prior name is 

 H. crossei. Between this species and H. bilamellata there is a perfect 

 series of intergrades in size, sculpture and number of whorls. We 

 mean by this that some individuals of an H. crossei colony could not 

 be distinguished from mearnsi; some mearnsi can be exactly matched 

 in a colony of bilamellata, or of media; and certain slender shells of 

 bilamellata would pass as langa. The other named forms are more 

 distinct, probably because we did not happen to collect where the 

 intergrading ccjlonies live. The races are therefore based upon the 

 forms dominant in each colony. One might easily define a half 

 dozen species, if only a f(>w shells from each place were in hand; 

 or if the internal lamelhe were taken to lie of specific weight, it 

 might be thought that there are between two and llinc times that 

 numlxr. 



There are iiiauy colonies, most of which liave some special eliar- 

 acters. A thorough exploration of the northern md of the raiigf 

 will undoubtedly bring to ligh;t very many more forms, so that an> 

 treatment lA the group must now be tentative. F(»r our present 

 purpose we consider the smallest form (crossei) and the larg(>st {bi- 

 lamellata) as .species, ranking the others as subspecies, though in some 

 cases they are more distinct than tlu'se two are from one another. 

 Several thou.sand shells were collected. 



The colonies at Stations 1, 2, 3, 12, are of very limitrd extrnt, 

 physical features restricting them. Station 5 is much larger. The 

 other Stations, 4, G, 8, 0. 10, 11. merely represent collecting points 

 in large an>as where IIolo.'<pira may be picked uj) almost anywhere 

 over considerable tracts, while at the same time there are larg** 

 areas in the region over wliidi these station* an- scattert'd where 

 no shells can be fouml.

The first four references cited al)uve pertain to specimens of the 

 original lot, of which there are 8 perfect shells in Coll. U. S. Nat. Mus. 

 and 2 in Coll. A. X. S. Phila. 



The species is distinguished from //. crossei chiefly l)y its greater 

 size. It was found by Mr. Daniels and the writer in great abundance 

 at Station 5, on the east side of Daniels Mountain under the cliffs 

 close to the summit, with Ashmunella viearnsi and OrcohcUx, in the 

 pinon zone. In most of the shells the external ribs weaken or dis- 

 appear on the penultimate and one or two earlier whorls, but in 

 .some they continue to the last, as in the type lot of hilamellata. 



Sixty examples from Station 5 opened, most of them measured 

 give the following data: 



(1) One lamella, the axial. 13 specimens = 21§%. 



(2) Two lamellae, axial and basal. 41 specimens = 68^%.

In size, sculpture and sliajx', we can find no external character 

 correllated with the differences in internal structure. The speci- 

 mens from Station 5 are from one colony. 



It will be seen that the typical biUtmellata axial struct un^ pre- 

 dominates, nearly 70% having that arrangement of lamelhc. The 

 dimensions of this lot agree well with those given by IJartsch for 

 8 .specimens in the U. S. Xat. Mus., })ut our lot, being larger, inchules

 Types Nos. 112,269, A. N. 8. P., collected l)y Pilshry and Daniels, 

 August 22, 1910. 



Out of 20 shells oi)ened, 16 have three lamella? and 4 have two, 

 the axial and basal. The pillar-like shape, numerous whorls, and 

 prevalence of a superior lamella, as well as the deeper position of the 

 lamellae, are individually varial)le characters, yet in the aggregate 

 they may suffice to define a race in this group. 



These Holospiras live among rocks where there is very little 

 xerophytic vegetation and the heat is terrific. The type lot was 

 picked up at about the same elevation as Station 5, but there the 

 exposure is less calorific, the sparse pinons and the cliffs afford 

 shade, so that the soil retains some moisture. 



Holospiras were seen scattered over a large area below and around 

 Station 4.

Also one shell which has two basal laniolUr. The upper partition 

 was broken away in opening, so that the presence of a superior 

 lamella is uncertain. 



This form stands nearest to H. b. mearnsi, but the striation is 

 sharper, not partially effacetl on the later whorls and the cone is in 

 the average longer. The habitats of mearnsi and media are rather 

 remote from one another, and several other forms inhabit territory 

 between them. 



The specimens from Station 12 arc more like mearnsi, the sculpture 

 being weak on the penultimate and next earlier whorls. Out of 

 11 opened — 

 ^ 2 have one lamella, axial. 



9 have two lamellae, axial and basal. 



1 has three lamellae, axial, basal and superior. 



Station 2 is on the northern slope of one of the ravines ea.st of 

 and running from Teocalli Rutte, at the foot of an irregular pro- 

 jecting bench of limestone. It is nmch the lowest station where 

 shells were found in the Hachetas. The shells are partly as rough

These .><lu'll.s connet't H. crossci and //. hildinclhtld. Specimens 

 of intermediate size agree exactly with one of the type lot of nivdrnsi, 

 kinilly lent from the National Museum. The smallest shells are 

 indistinguishable from crossei, while the largest could not be .separated 

 from small bilanHllata. Yet the colony as a whole has a certain 

 indivitluality by its intermediate size, and as the form has been named, 

 we let it .stand as a convenient place for crossci-bilameUnta inter- 

 grades. It is attached to //. biUimdUita rather than to H. crossei, 

 because the prevalent form, in the snuill lot opened, is bilamellate. 

 All of the shells were collected in one spot where the writer sat 

 resting. A large quantity could have been gathered had time and 

 strength permitted. A few .specimens, are quite finely striate, 

 while others are rather coarsely ribbed, like the type of mearnsi; 

 still others i)eing intermediate in .sculpture. The sculpture in 

 some shells becomes very much weaker on the penultimate and 

 next earlier whorls. 



H. mearnsi served as monotype of the suljgenus Hnplostemma 

 Dall, characterized by the possession of an axial lamella only. Bartsch, 

 opening another specimen, found a basal lamella also, and concluded 

 thit that lamella had l)een broken away in opening the original 

 specimen. Since some full\- adult examples are known to have an 

 axial lamella only, it is likely that Dall's original diagnosis was 

 correct for the specimen he opened, w^iile Bartsch was also right 

 as to the .shell he examined and which we have saen.

 which there are 11 perfect specimens in Coll. U. S. Nat. Mus. and 2 

 in Coll. A. N. S. P. One of these two has a VQty weak, hardly notice-

 there. 



The writer collected H. crossei at the type locality, the summit 

 of Hacheta Grande. The exact spot, Station 11, is just off the 

 western edge of the small level tract at the summit, which is marked 

 by a small stone monument. Being much higher, this station is 

 less dr>' than Station 5, where the large //. hilnnicllata abounds, and

The embryonic shell, of slightly over 2 whorls, is smooth and 

 projects nii)pkMike. The following whorls of the cone are strongly 

 ril)heci, hut the ribs weaken more or less on the cylindrical j^art, 

 so that on the penultimate whorl they are often inconspicuous or 

 almost wanting (for brevity called "smooth" in the above tables). 

 There is of course complete intergradation in this character, so that 

 the cla.ssification in the talkie is more or less arbitrary. The size 

 averages larger in shells with 2 or 3 lamellae, but there are exceptions. 

 It will be understood that the measurements were based upon shells 

 which to all external appearance are adult or old. After a careful 

 study of the aperture and lip, I think that it may be accepted as 

 certain that the variations in lamella recortled above are not depend- 

 ent upon age of the indivitlual. 



At Station 10, on the northern slope of Hacheta Grande Mt., 

 a .small series was taken. All of them have the whorls of the cylindric 

 portion smooth or nearly so, glossy, the cone and the last whorl, 

 or its last half, being ribbed as usual. Ten specimens opened measure 

 as follows: 



Length 14.2, diam. 4 mm.; whorls 14; axial and basal lamellae. 



This lot, by the size of some individuals and the large number 

 (50%) of bilamellate example, is intermediate between crossei and 

 tnearnsi, as it also is in the elevation of the station. It has a feature 

 of its own in the smooth median whorls, parallelled, however, by 

 .some individuals of crossei from the mountain top. Xone of the 

 meamsi seen are so smooth.

 A. N. S. P.. collectotl l)y Pilsl)ry. Augu.^^t 25. lUlO. 



This species is al)un(lant at Station 11, in the dirt under stones. 

 It is more closely related to V. pcrspediva Sterki tlian to any other, 

 but it is a very much larger shell. V. cyclopherella has far finer 

 striation. V. yracilicosta has closer riblets and a much smaller 

 umbilicus. V. albula has a smaller umbilicus. 



Having collected and identified some thousands of the \'allonias 

 of Arizona and New Mexico in the last ten years, it was a surprise 

 to find a species which differs conspicuously from the three mountain 

 si>ecies mentioned al)ove. As we have not found V. sonorana el.><e- 

 where in our work in southern New Mexico and Arizona, it seem'* 

 likely that it is a southern species which barely crosses the inter- 

 national boundary. As a rule, Vallonias are rather widely dis- 

 tributed snails. 



The Holarctic genus Vallonia now comprises about 25 recent and 

 pleistocene and a half dozen tertiary species, besides about a dozen 

 named varieties. It is likely that some of these are mere synonyms. 

 We have nine recent species in the United States, all of them readily 

 recognizable, except V. excentrica, which is often hard to tell from 

 pulchella.

II. The Florida Molxtaix.s. 



The Florida range (accent on the is about twelve miles long, 

 with a maximum elevation .slightly exceeding 7,000 ft. It runs from 

 north to south. A partially detached but adjacent continuation 

 northward is known as the "Little Floridas. " As in neighljoring 

 ranges, there is a long ascent or mesa before reaching the base of 

 the mountains proper (5,000 ft.), characterized l)V a zone of tree 

 3'uccas. The mountains are arid and rather barren, of limestone in 

 the middle towards the top. granitic .southward and porphyritic 

 northward. Vegetation scruljby. We noted as common two small 

 species of oak, hackberry. sotol, cylindropuntia, a broad-leaverl 

 agave, etc. Barrel cactus (bisnaga) was seen at the foot. 



In November, 1906, Mr. Ferris and the author drove out from 

 Deming 18 miles to Mr. Pri.ser's cabin, where there is a small spring, in 




1915.

Spring Canyon.' This is above the middle of the west side of the 

 range. The summit here projects as a limestone butte, bounded by 

 cliffs on the ea.st, north and west sides. Access was gained to the top 

 on the .south side. The flat summit is covered with grass, Fouquiena, 

 Cylindropuntia and other cacti, Agave, etc. No shells. There is a 

 fine outlook, the jagged Organ Mountains silhouetted eastward. 

 Around the base of this central summit we found Aahmunella walkeri 

 and Sonorelln by digging in the soil among the rocks, where there was 

 shade. We found only seven species of snails in all.

The genitalia of S. h. flora (fig. 6, F, G) resemble the same organs 

 in 8. hnchitana, except that the penis is decidedly and constantly 

 longer, as are also the vagina and spcrmathecal duct. The penis- 

 papilla is indistinctly annulate and tapers slowly to the ai^ex. The 

 penis-retractor is long and slender, attached to the apex of the penis, 

 and enveloping the base of the epiphallus. Measurements of the 

 organs have been given on page 328. 



The pallial organs are much as in Sonorella optata, but there is no 

 white thread defining the secondary ureter. 



The sole, in alcoholic examples, resembles that of Sonorella bicipitis. 

 It is ochraceous in the middle, pale gray at the sides. Back and 

 flanks flark slate-gray, the tail fleshy-gray above, having an indis- 

 tinct median line. 



Jaw and teeth were described in a former paper of this series. 



Ashmunella walkeri Ferriss. Plate V, figs. 2 to 2e. 



This species was originally described from a few dead shells. We* 



found it living in abundance by digging 

 in the soil among the rocks where there 

 was shade. It lives in families or 

 "pockets." The snails are very hard 

 to pull, scarcely any coming out entire. 

 When they do, the shell is very light 

 colored, pale ochraceous salmon or pale 

 brown or entirely white. Old ones are 

 dull, but the be.st- preserved adults have

The genitalia (fig. 7) have no peculiar 



features. The ducts are rather short. Length of penis 3 mm.; 



epiphallus 14 mm.; vagina 2.5 mm.; .spermatheca 10 mm. The 



atrium is -well developed and the flagellum distinct, though .short 



as usual in the genus.

Oreoheliz strigosa var. 



Two broken and very old "l)one^" were found near the central 

 peak above the spring, where we found Ashmunelln and Sonorella. 

 The largest one, evidently adult, has the periphery bluntly angular 

 in front, becoming rounded on the last half whorl. There are faint 

 traces of bands above and below it. Spire rather elevated. Height 

 10.6, diam. 17.5, umbilicus -4 mm. It differs from 0. s. depresm 

 by the angulation of the periphery. Possibly an exploration of the 

 -southern end of the range, which from a distance looks rather good, 

 would reveal living Oreohelices, but we looked for them in vain in 

 the central and northern parts.

 papilla is slender, tapering, and subannulate or rather strongly 

 annulate. Epiphallus and flagellum as usual in the group of hachi- 

 tana. It differs from .S. hachitana by the decidedly longer penis, 

 which has a much longer l)a.sal sheath. The vagina is slightly

 (ju'on ne I'imagine (juelquefois, au point fjue j 'y vois avant tout 

 deux formes d'une meine disposition generale naturelle. 



Dans mon opini(jn, en effet, le volcanism<' et le metamorjihisme

 facteurs egalement indispensables: d'un cote le penetration sou- 

 terraine <le I'eau et des matieres comi)arables, en circulation dans 

 des regions i\ temperature convenablement elev(^e; et d 'autre part, 

 la reduction des niches impregnees, en fragments de toutes grosseurs,

A cet egard, et pour preciser la di.scussion, il est indispensable

 de faire des roches cristallophyliennes les jiroduits d'une t'u>ion

lour uuvra,u;c' intitule Synthese des Miniraiix ct dtn liochea, p. 45 

 (Paris. 1882). "Nous avoiis entrepris," disent-il.s, '' une s6rie 

 d 'exiH'rionees dont le r(§.sultat est d'augmenter consideral)lemcnt 

 le domaine dc la fusion purement ignee. Les conclusions a tirer 

 de nos recherches peuvent en effet se r^sumer comme il suit: un 

 ^rand nombre de roches (?ruptives anciennes et modernos doivcnt 

 leur origine ii Taction exclusive d'une fusion, suivie d'un lent refroi- 

 dissement. les fumerolles et les agents volatils ne produisant que 

 la decompo.sition ulterieure des mineraux primitifs de ces roches, 

 leur action est purement secondaire. " Conclusion formelle qui 

 repose sur ce raisonnement que, si une experience donne naissance 

 a un produit semblable a un mineral naturel, la methode mise en 

 <jeuvre par I'experimentateur coincide necessairement avec le mode 

 operatoire de la nature. Or, c'est la une incontestable imprudence. 



Je sais bien que la fusion ignee a fourni maintes ".syntheses" 

 de haute valeur pour la chimie et meme pour la mineralogie; je sais 

 bien que Mitscherlich a demontre Tidentite, avec la faj^alite ou 

 peridot ferrugincux, de certains cristaux contenus dans des laitiers 

 metallurgiques; Ebelmen a imite, dans leurs composition et dans 

 leur forme, le rubis balai et les autres spinelles, en faisant evaporer 

 la solution de leur constituants dans I 'acide borique, fondu au feu 

 des fours a porcelaine; que Hautefeuille a prepare des cristaux de 

 feldspath orthose de la meme fa^on, en employant comme dissolvant 

 le molybdate de potasse liquefie.par la chaleur rouge; que bien 

 d 'autres succes ont ete obtenus dans la meme voie par bien d 'autres 

 experimentateurs et pour bien d 'autres mineraux. Mais ces resultats 

 ne comportent aucune consequence dont puisse profiter la Geologic. 

 En conclure que les mineraux mentionnes sont des produits de 

 fusion seche naturelle c'est une erreur contre laquelle je n'ai 

 jamais cess^ de protester, bien que la plupart des geologues aicnt 

 continue longtemps a croire a I'origine des roches cristallophyl- 

 liennes par la voie purement plutonique. 



Quelques-uns cependant y admettent un temperament^ par la 

 collaljoration de "vapeurs montant de I'interieur, veritables 

 colonnes filtrantes apportant, avec divers gaz, des silicates et des 

 borates alcalins. " L'auteur ne dit pas d'oCi viennent ces col- 

 laborateurs si opportuns, ni comment ils se sont conserves en 

 profondeur jusqu'au moment d 'intervenir, ni par quel proc^d^ ils 

 peuvent traverser les roches fondues superpos^es et y reraplacer

 1899, MM. Fouque et Michel Levy^ sont revenus sans paraitre I'en 

 apercevoir eu.\ memes sur leurs assertions precedentes, en relatant 

 des resultats procures par le recuit de verres de granit dans Veou 

 surechauffee. 



Sans contester la ressemblance des resultats artificiels avec des 

 mineraux natifs, il reste indispensable de constater que la structure 

 microscopique des roches cristallophylliennes est en r^alite, et quoi 

 qu'on ait souvent suppose, incompatible avec I'hypothese de In 

 fusion ignee. 



Xous Savons par les experiences de Senarmont* et de ses succes- 

 .seurs que, par I'effet combine de la chaleur et de la pression. I'eau 

 remanie la substance terreuse des sediments et la convertit en 

 mineraux cristallises semblables k ceux dont sont fails les terrains 

 cristallophylliens. Xous savons aussi que, pour obtenir ces resultats, 

 il suffit que I'eau surechauffee soit portee a une temperature incom- 

 parablement plus faible que celle oii fondraicnt les matieres modifiees: 

 c'est a 300° seulement que Daubree, par la decomposition du verre 

 dans I'appareil de Senarmont. a fait cristalliser le pyroxene diopside, 

 comme Senarmont avait deja fait cri.stalliser le quartz. Nous savons 

 enfin, par I'etude des l)locs de calcaires stratifies, rejctes on melange

Toutefois, il faut convenir que les resultats de Senarmont. con- 

 sider(^s en eux .'^euls, et Cjuekjue admirai)les, qu'ils doivent nous 

 apparaite, ne sont pas suffisants pour rendre compte de la difference

II ne faut j^as oublior a cotto occasion que le mdlange en propor- 

 tions convenal)le.s des roches scdiinentaires les plus communes, 

 fournit i\ 1 'analyse la meme composition chimique que les roches 

 cristallines. Et c 'est pourquoi nous assistons parfois et, par example, 

 dans 1 'ejiaisseur de houilleres, qui, comme a Commentry ont eprouv^ 

 suffisanunent longtemps un emhrasement accidentel, des produits 

 imitant, en tout ou en partie, pour leur composition min^ralogique, 

 des roches erujitives de la categoric des laves.* 



Or, c'est precisement cet ensemble de reactions qui parait avoir 

 laiss6 ses traces dans la substance des formations metamorphiques 

 et cristallophylliennes. ^lalgre la dimension gigantesque de ces 

 formations, c'est dans I'intimite de leur structure qu'on doit esperer 

 retrouver, comme a la piste, les conditions memes de leur Elaboration. 



D'ailleurs, tout le monde est d 'accord a ce sujet, au point qu'k 

 premiere vue, la remarque semble bien inutile. Elle n'est 

 cependant pas aussi banale qu'elle pent le paraitre tout d'abord, 

 car il n'y a certainement pas de chapitre des sciences geologiques 

 qui ait ete aussi activement etudie que I'examen microscopique des 

 roches cristallines pr^alablement reduites en lames minces. Les 

 savants les plus distingues, voire les plus illustres, ont a I'envi col- 

 labore a ses progres et les resultats acquis sont tie premiere valeur 

 pour Tanalyse des roches et pour leur determination min^ralogique. 

 Mais au point de vue geogenique, ils ont ete deformes par I'id^e 

 precongue de la fusion ignee. 



II pent sembler Strange qu'on vienne dire en face a la legion 

 innombrable des lithologi.stes: "Vous dccrivez inlassablement les 

 roches les plus varices et cependant, tout en y recoltant des 

 moissons infiniment pr^cieuses de faits capitaux, vous ne les avez 

 pa.s comprises. Vous avez meconnu le caractere essentiel de la 

 substance minerale, qui est d'etre en proie, de la maniere la 

 plus continue, k des modifications de composition et de structure; 

 qui se defait et se refait sans cesse par des phenomenes si internes 

 qu'ils ne peuvent etre compares qu'a ceux d'ou resulte la biologic 

 des ti.s.sas des plantes et des animaux. ..." C'est pourtant ce que 

 je viens faire aujourd'hui, apres avoir hesite des annees. 



On reconnaitra, en effet, que les masses ramenees a la surface du

 des produits de trituration, resultant de.s fins debris de materiaux tres 

 divers, malaxes et petris les uns avec les autres, puis cinientes entre 

 eux par une substance conjonctive de composition varial)le. 



Aussi a-t-on, certe, bien le droit de s'etonner ciu'une pareille 

 structure, si l^ien reconnue et si bien decrite par tons les lithologistes 

 du monde entier, n 'ait pas fait rejeter depuis longtemps une hypothese 

 tr§s ant^rieure a toute notion histologique des roches. Xotons 

 cependant en passant que des faits, bien anciennement aper^us 

 proclamaient, j usque dans les laves volcaniques, et au moment 

 meme de leur extravasement sur le sol, un ^tat different de la fusion 

 proprement dite. On avait constate, dans le sein de la masse Huide, 

 des grains deja parfaitement solides, cristallins, ay ant meme subi 

 des deteriorations, a la suite de chocs et de froissements. C'est 

 pour consacrer cette circonstance si imprevue que Haiiy a ai)pliqu(!i 

 au plus visible des mineraux dont il s'agit, le nom caracteristique 

 de pyroxene: Stranger au feu. 



Pour nous, ce nom exprimera le mode de formation du mineral 

 par voie mixte (eau surechauffeej et nous le traduirons par: et ranger 

 k la fusion du creuset (voie .seche). C'est comme si Haiiy avait eu 

 rintuiti(jn de la verite cjui edate aujourd'luii, et le microscope nous 

 montre maintenant cjue les mineraux plus fins que les gros pyroxenes 

 n'ont pa.s, plus cju'eux, dte formes par fusion s6che. Comme eux, 

 ils ont et<5 amenes en grains plus ou moins fragmentaires, anguleux 

 ou dmousses, associes :\ ([(_•<, fluides, li(|uides, vapeurs et gaz com-

 souterraines dans le reseau des fisssures produites, a combl^ ces 

 dernieres par la concretion lentement op^ree, de calcite et de quartz 

 cristallins. Le phenomene s'est sans doute reproduit une serie de 

 fois et c'est ainsi que la roche s'est progressivement repliee d'une 

 maniere tres serree, jouissant d'une fausse plasticite, de tout point 

 comparable a celle qui permet a la glace des glaciers de se mouler 

 sur.la forme des valines, dont ceux-ci occupent le thalweg. 



Le result at, produit sur une echelle relativement faible dans la 

 roche argilo-calcaire de Montreux, s'est developpe avec une intensite 

 incomparable dans le gneiss et dans les roches analogues, oii le 

 developpement de la schistosite, comme la production de plis et 

 de contournements inextricables, s'est accompagnee de la pul- 

 verisation et de la cimentation alternatives des fragments produits 

 et de plus en plus ecartes les uns des autres, par le mouvement 

 v^ritablement peristaltique qui accompagne la progression souter- 

 raine des lames de charriage. 



En general, les geologues qui ont ^tudie les lames de charriage 

 ne se sont guere preoccupes d'expliquer leur mise en mouvement, 

 de definir 1 'origine de la force qui les a deplacees, ni de pr^ciser si 

 leur progression a eu lieu en profondeur ou a la surface du sol. M. 

 Termier, sans decider la question, laisse cependant soupgonner sa 

 preference pour cette derniere alternative:^ " Pour mon compte," dit-il^ 

 " je ne puis pas ne pas croire au passage sur le Brian^onnais, apr^s la 

 constitution de 1 'eventail, d 'une masse pesante allant de 1 'E. ^ 1 'O. . . .

La masse pesanto qui aurait ainsi rampe sur le Brianconnais, faisant 

 Toffice d'lin traineau ecraseur . . . etc." Je me borne a noter que 

 la coupe, que j 'ai in.seree en 1902, dans le journal La Xature, con- 

 formement a 1 'indication donnt^e au debut du present travail, ne 

 laisse aucune incertitutle quant a mon opinion personnelle. Elle 

 met sous les yeux du locteur, le developpement d'un phenomena 

 souterrain, dont la cause dynamique est toute trouvee dans la con- 

 traction meme du noyau terrestre. Par cette coupe, on s'explique 

 comment la superposition de terrains ancien.s sur des terrains plus 

 recents, est le regime ordinaire, — parce qu'il est necessaire, — des 

 regions montagneuses; comment des paquets de roches supportes. 

 par une geocla.se faiblement inclinee sur 1 'horizon et surmont^e de 

 raa.ssifs dnormes et puissamment pesants, out sii gravir pen a peu la 

 rampe qui se presentait tlevant eux et, au moins en certnins cas, 

 abandonner leurs "racines"; comment ils ont du infliger a Unir sup- 

 port, et sul)ir eux-memes, des plissements, des ruptures et des ecrase- 

 ments, me-langeant des debris de leure parties scparees. 



En general aussi, on rai.sonne comme si le phenom^ne m^canique 

 etait completement distinct du jihenomene metamorphicjue et connne 

 .si, par consequent, une masse gneissique charriee a un nombre quel- 

 conque de kilometres de son point de depart, pouvait etre reside 

 identique t\ ce qu'elle etait k ses debuts. M. Termier a ecrit.'* 

 "T.es actions mecanicjues dcforment; elles ne transforment pas. Si

en dcartant latciitationd'admettre des interruptions dans revolution 

 plan(?taire, comportc la plus haute signification pliilosophiciue, 

 perniet de suivre pas a pas les transformations d'une vase sahlo- 

 argileuse en schiste ardoiser, en micaschiste et en gneiss: Evolution 

 qui n'ost qu'un detail du d(!^veloppemont normal dc la terrc. Ainsi 

 apparait la finalite du metamorphisme, qui pormet revolution plan^- 

 taire sans alteration des conditions de continuity i\ la surface, et par 

 une circulation verticale ou orocjcniquc de la matiore des roches. 



La penetration de I'eau en profondeur resulte surtout de I'en- 

 sevelissement progressif de chaque sediment sous r('mi)ilement des 

 depots qui lui succedent. 



Les niateriaux de recouvrement exercent en effet, sur le sediment 

 choisi eomme exemple, des effets complexes: i)ar leur poids, ils lui 

 donnent, suivant les cas, plus ou moins de compacito et le privent 

 d'une fraction plus ou moins grande de son eau d'imbilMtion initiale; 

 par leur faible conductibilite calorifique, ils lui conservent un ^chauffe- 

 ment qui va en augmcntant au fur et a mcsure des progres de 

 I'enfouissement. 



Mais il importe extremement de constater, et nous ne saurions 

 trop y insister, que le milieu rocheux sur lequel va s'exercer la 

 collaboration des solutions souterraines et de la chaleur, est soumis 

 k un regime essentiellement mecanique. Par suite des circonstances 

 deja indiquees, il eprouve des compressions inegales suivant les 

 point et diversement orientees. La pesanteur, qui determine la 

 eompacite, purement sedimentaire, et qui agit de haut en bas, doit 

 se composer avec les poussees tangentielles derivant de la contrac- 

 tion du noyau et dont la direction pent etre consideree comme 

 horizontale. En outre, les reactions internes developpent, soit des 

 contractions, soit des dilatations, localisees les unes et les autres et 

 variables selon les moments. De telle sorte, qu'independamment des 

 d^placements en masses, dont la progression des lames de charriage 

 est la forme la plus visible, il faut considerer le deplacement relatif 

 des elements rocheux. II n'y a pas d 'autre raison a chercher de 

 1 'etat, avant tout craqueie, des fissures microscopiques qui se croisent 

 en tons sens avec des largeurs et des longueurs diverses. On explique 

 de meme I'etat fragmentaire de tons les mineraux et la relation de 

 contacts, souvent imprevus, des Eclats dans lesquels ils ont 6t6

 cristallophylliens. 



L 'ensemble des fissures mieroscopiques, qui constitue le fait le 

 plus frappant des roehes qui nous occupent. est comparaljle a un 

 reseau eapillaire. dans lecjuel les fluides de profondeur. eau surechaufifee 

 et autres, circulent avec une activite incessante et variable suivant 

 les points et les instants. Parmi les reactions qui s'y developpent 

 et qui font a.ssister I'esprit a une .sorte (.V intussusception rappelant 

 celle des tissus organiques, on doit mentionner les precipites de 

 materiaux, en lacis conjonctifs, des debris derivant de recrasement. 

 Et c'est pour cela que, dans les granits. par exeniple. les gneiss, les 

 micaschistes, on voit de toutes parts de petits Eclats de mica, inclus 

 dans des plages de quartz et d 'autres substances, sans que la nettete 

 de leurs ca.ssures ait etc en rien alteree par un emoussenient ou par 

 un bourrelet, tels qu'en produirait la situation dan> un l)ain de 

 cristal de roche en fusion. 



II va de soi qu'il faut compter, dans les causes de modification 

 de ces ph^nom^nes, — outre la variation de composition des courants 

 mineralisateurs. provenant de localites changeantes, — les deplace- 

 ments verticaux determines par les bossellemcnts gen(5raux, e'est- 

 a-dire la progression souterraine des lames de charriage. Pendant 

 I'ascension vers la surface, les conditions du milieu ambiants'adoucis- 

 .sent et les travaux mineralogicjues internes se restreignent jusqu'ii 

 s'arreter. Mais la subsidence compensatrice de segments voisins, 

 transportc dans ceux-ci les conditions memos que nous venons 

 d'indiquer. De sorte que nous ne pouvons douter de 1 'existence 

 au moment pr<!'cis oii nous sommes, et dans des lieux convenal)lement 

 situ6s, de toutes le sconditions nt'ressaires h 1 Y'laboration des gneiss 

 et des roehes connexes. 



On voit done que la "catacla.se" intense et ininterrompue des 

 masses cristallophylliennes pr^sente une importance v«'Tital)lement 

 dominatrice dans toute I'economie planetaire. ( 'clle-ci a, comme

 au fond d'un hassin sedimeiitaire, a t ravers tous les types metamor- 

 phiques, j usque au gneiss et au granit. 



Le travail souterrain, contrepartie exacte des fonctions super- 

 ficielles, reconstitue ainsi la maniere de minerai d'ou celles-ci tirent 

 les substances simples des assises stratifiees. C'est la constatation 

 d'un cycle continu. deja soupgonne par Lyell, et les geologues qualifies 

 d'aclualistes, et auquel le point de vue adiriste^'^ donne une allure et 

 une portee toutes nouvelles. 



II importe d'aj outer que la cataclase est un phenomene beaucoup 

 plus considerable encore que, les faits precedents malgre leur 

 ampleur, ne le feraient supposer. Je tiens, en terminant ce travail, 

 a preciser le role de ce phenomdne dans I'histoire des rochcs extra- 

 terrestre, tenant a ne pas laisser passer cette occasion de souligner, 

 par un exemple specialement frappant, la portee philosophique et 

 la fecondite educatrice de la Geologic Comparee. 



La structure brechiforme d'un grand noml^re de meteorites a 

 frapp4 tous les observateurs, qui cependant n'en ont pas compris la 

 haute signification. ]\OL Fouque et Michel Levy ont pensc en 

 devoiler la cause: "La frequence de ce phenomene (les breches 

 microscopiques) dans les meteorites peut etre, disent-ils,i^ rapportee, 

 soit a un mouvement explosif , qui les a lancees dans 1 'espaee, soit a 

 I'enorme pression qu'elles subissent en traversant I'atmosphere 

 terre.stre, .soit meme a 1 'agglutination de parties individuellement 

 formees par Taction ignee. " Voila, on en conviendra, un bien grand 

 luxe d 'explications pour un seul phenomene. Chacune des trois 

 hypotheses peche cependant par la base et leur reunion temoigne 

 surtout chez leurs auteurs d'une ignorance absolue de 1 'economic 

 generale des meteorites, dont ils n'avaient sans doute eturlie cjue 

 quelques specimens s^par^s et pris au hasard.

que la constatation, si l)analo. de la catacla.se chez les meteorites 

 doit etre rangee parmi les faits les plus eloquents qui conduisent a 

 reconnaitre, dans les blocs de roches tombant du ciel, des debris 

 provenant d'un seul ct merae organisme planetaire ayant evolu4 

 exactement comme notre globe lui-ineme. Seules, en efet, les reactions 

 actuellement en cours dans la masse terrestre sont capables d'expli- 

 quer les details de 1 'histologic meteoritique. La cataclase. 6tendue 

 a 1 'histoire des meteorites, est un argument nouveau ct decisif pf)ur 

 demontrer la realite des initiales relations stratigraphiques des 

 divers types de roches cosmiques. 



II y a meme plus encore; si 1 'observation de la croilte terre.stre 

 ^claire ainsi leur hi.stoire, ces roches a leur tout permettent de 

 preciscr, dans le mecanisme du broyage orogenique, des details 

 que les roches terrestre's etudiees seules sont en general impuis- 

 santes i nous revdler. Ce sont certaines meteorites metalliques, 

 dont la malleabilitc a permis 1 'inscription, dans leur sul)stance, do 

 reactions mecanicjues dont s'est accompagne leur broyage durant 

 les efforts tangentiels de la contraction, ou systole planetaire.

 comme en montrent les fers de Mukenjp (Afrif|ue Australe) et

J 'arreterai ici, pour ne pas abuser de la bienveillance de 1 'illustre 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, la sdrie des faits qui 

 appuient la conclusion de nies etudes sur les actions niecaniciues dont 

 Tepaisseur de la croute planetaire est le theatre d'une maniere inin- 

 t<?rrompue. Comme on vient de le voir, les effets en sont prodigieuse- 

 ment diflferents par ieurs dimensions d'un jioiut a un autre, depuis 

 le charriage en masse dont le massif du Mont-Blanc tout entier parait 

 ne repr^senter qu'un r^sidu fort diminu6, jusqu'au craquellement 

 i:»resque moleculaire, en tout cas microscopique, des elements min- 

 eralogiques des roches de tous ages et de toutes categories, qui 

 parviennent progressivement k la condition cristallophyllienne. 



L 'admission de I'activite mecanique parmi les facteurs essentiels 

 de la vie planetaire, est d'autant plus necessaire que la cause meme 

 de cette d^pende d'energie delate a nos yeux avec plus d 'evidence. 

 Le refroidissement spontane du noyau terrestre ne pent pas se pour- 

 suivre sans determiner le retrait, a tendance centripete mais a mani- 

 festations tangentielles, qui refoule sans relache la croiite a peine 

 f''>rmee. Les consequences de ce remaniement n'acquierent la 

 totalite de leur signification qu'au prLx de la collaboration des pres- 

 sions engendrees par le rechauffement souterrain de regions rocheuses, 

 prealablement pourvues, comme on I'a dit, de materiaux elastiques 

 qui savent faire de celles-ci, par 1 'elevation de leur temperature, 

 des agents d'actioas mecaniques centrifuges. 



Ces travaux se realisent selon un mode operatoire harmoniquement 

 cordonnd avec toutes les necessites de la vie planetaire, abstraction 

 faite, bien entendu des consequences individuelles qui en rdsultent 

 fatalement. Car nous devojis chercher a nous degager du point

MOLLUSCA OF THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES, VII: THE DRAGOON, MULE, 

 SANTA RITA. BABOQUIVARI, AND TUCSON RANGES. ARIZONA 



BY HENHY A. riLSBRY AND JAMES H. FERRIS.S. 



This paper and the preceding one (Vl) contain the account of 

 mollu.sLs collected in course of our exploration.s in 1910, from the 

 middle of August to the middle of October. The forms obtained 

 in the Santa C'atalina Mountains will be described in connection 

 with the collections made there by one of us (Ferri.ss) in 1913. We 

 were ably assisted in the field by Mr. L. E. Daniels.^ Besides the 

 ranges enumerated in the title, some account is given of several 

 minor hill groups, all in the region south of the Southern Pacific 

 Railroad. While this paper, with those already published on the 

 Chiricahua and Huachuca Ranges, is monographic for the moUusks 

 of Arizona .south of the Southern Pacific, yet the field is far from 

 exhausted. Our work is a reconnai.s.sance rather than a complete 

 malacological survey. Further species will reward search in the 

 southwestern end and outliers of the Chiricahuas, the southern 

 Dragoons, the Whetstone Range, and the mountains around and 

 south of Tombstone. Further west we have explored only small 

 middle sections of the Santa Rita and Babotjuivari Ranges. Many 

 hill and mountain groups l)etween Tucson and Nogales remain 

 untouchcfl, most of them doul)tiess inhal)it<'d by endemic species 

 of Sonorella. In the nearly waterless region westward between 

 the Baboquivari Range and the Colorado Riv<'r, almo.st nothing 

 ha< been done a.'^ide from some account of the snails of tin- ("omol»al>i 

 Mountains, which we are now giving. 



(loing westward in .southern Arizona from the eastern limit of the 

 State, the general level falls and the moimtaiiis ix-comc lower and 

 smaller. There is a gradual elimination of snails recjuiring a reason- 

 able degree of humidity. Ashmunclla and Oreohelix extend west to 

 the Iluachueas. Beyon<l that range they disappear. The small 

 shells also al)ruptly diminish in number ui genera and .>i)t(ies, by 



' \Vf an; iri<l«'J)ff<l to Mr. J. f '. liliitniT, of Tuc.'son, for ."cverul (<pf<M«-.s from the 

 Comohiibi and C'ahabi .Mountain.'*, which wc did not viait.

elimination of the Transition Zone forms. Holospira, too, becomes 

 rare. In the Santa Cruz River X'allev it is known by one species — 

 at the present time, one specimen; and none are known from further 

 west. The sjiread of this f>;enus is not controlletl by humidity. It 

 lives in the driest and hottest situations, often at low elevations, 

 but it is confined to limestone tracts, and limited by volcanic or 

 mctamorphic rock. The mountains westward, in the region under 

 consideration, are mainly volcanic, and the stony tracts are therefore 

 unsuitable for Holoftpira. 



The progressive impoverishment of the fauna leaves, in the Santa 

 Cruz \'alley and westward, a few Lower Sonoran Pupillidre, Zoniticki', 

 Thysanophora (hornii), arid the true desert snail, Sonorella. Sonorella 

 will live in the most arid places, where the rainfall does not exceed 

 5 or 6 inches, .so long as there is abundant rock shelter and a certain 

 amount of shade, such as the shadow of a cliff or a small l)ush. 

 Northern slopes are preferred. In exploring a new mountain or hill 

 in the really arid country one aims for the northern or northwestern 

 slope under the highest crags. If coarse talus or rock "slides" are 

 found, persistent quarrying should produce Sonorella. In less arid 

 mountains, such as the Santa Ritas, the most productive collecting 

 stations are in the deep, verdant canyons. 



The exact location of collecting stations, and especially of type 

 localities, which we attempt in these papers, may seem meticulous 

 to many zoologists. In humid areas, or in dealing with less sedentary 

 animals, such exactness would hardly be worth while; if a type 

 locality is fixed within a few miles, it is near enough. But here we 

 deal with a region of intense local differentiation and with creatures 

 which are often confined within narrow bounds by physical conditions. 

 The hunt is difficult and laborious. The colonies are often so small, 

 the country .so vast, that, without careful directions, one might make 

 a season's campaign in the more complex ranges without relocating 

 some former find which it might be important to investigate further. 

 It is, moreover, important to show exactly what ground has been 

 covered, in order that further exploration can be made to the best 

 advantage, that the unexplored parts of the ranges may be gone 

 over. In future it will be of interest to be able to trace the changes 

 and fate of the .smaller and more isolated colonies, such as that of 

 Sonorella eremita, which covers an area of only a few square rods, 

 many miles from any other .snail colony. We suggest that future 

 collectors continue our serial station numlxrs in each range, instead 

 of h>eginning again at No. 1.

I. The Dragoon Mountains. 



This range stands 25 or 30 miles west of the Chiricahua Mountains 

 in Cochise County, Arizona. The well-known clouble-lieadcd peak 

 of Dos Cabezas is seen northeastward and the Whetstone Mountains 

 westward, but the Dragoons are entirely isolated from other ranges. 

 The Pearce mining district lies on the east side. To its pro.ximity 

 and the demand for mine timber the deforestation of the mountains 

 is due. All of the timber was cut about 25 years ago, but the 

 range, now forming the Dragoon Forest Reserve, shows gootl repro- 

 duction in places. At present the mountains are almost as bare 

 as the Dos Cabezas. 



The range is reached from Dragoon Summit, a station on the 

 Southern Pacific K. R. at the northwestern foot of the mountains. 

 North of the railroad the "Little Dragoons" form a low continuation 

 of the range. There is a depression at ^Nlicklle Pass (Middlemarch 

 Canyon), where a road from Tombstone to Pearce crosses the range. 

 We did not explore the southern half of the range, Ijelow Middle- 

 march, nor the Little Dragoons north of the railroad. 



The mountains are formed of a complex of limestones and igneous 

 rock, the granites forming wild labyrinths of narrow gorges abounding 

 in cliffs and falls, .separated by inaccessible crags and spires, which 

 gave a refuge to the Apaches thirty or forty years ago. The lime- 

 stones, forming a large part of the range, are accessible enough, 

 though rather al)rupt, and as usual they proved much more prolific 

 of snails than the granitic and andesitic rocks. 



The range was visited by us (Ferriss, Daniels and Pilsbryj in 

 (X-tober, IIHO. A week was spent in Tweed Canyon, where there is 

 a small stream. The map (p. 3(3(3) sliowing collecting stations from 

 Stations 7 and 8 northward was sketched from high i)oints around 

 Tweed Canyon and its northern amphitheatre. After I'il.-bry iiail

 and the stations (28 30) .south of Station 8 are located by notes 

 and a sketch made l)y them.-

The fauna of this small range is strongly individualized, since all 

 of the Holospiras and larger Helices are very distinct from species 

 of other ranges, even the Sonorellas having well-defined conchological 

 features. Like the Huachucas, there is (or was) an Oreohelix of the 

 strigosa group, but hair>' forms and the Radiocentrum group are 

 Avanting. The minute shells are all species common to the Chiri- 

 cahua, Huachuca and other larger ranges, but the Transition and 

 Canadian Zone species are very sparsely represented by Pijramidula 

 cronkhitei, Cochlicopa lubrica and Vertigo coloradensis arizonensis 

 only. Otherwise the fauna is purely Lower Sonoran. 



The collecting stations are as follows: 



Station 1. Slide of heavy, angular rock on west side of cataract 

 branch of Tweed Canyon, below the crags of this side. 



Station 2. Near the foot of small ravine next west of the granite 

 defile forming tlic (mtlet of the Tweed amphitheatre. 



Station 3. Near and at top of ridge alcove Station 2. 



Station 4. Rim of amphitheatre, western side. 



Station 5. Immediately north of small peak at N. W. of amphi- 

 theatre. 



Station (5. Crag alxjut half way up mountain on east side of cataract 

 branch, overlooking part of Cochise Stronghold. 



Station 6J. West of Station G.

The shell is .strongly depressed, umbilicate (the width of uml)ilicus 

 contained six times in the diameter of the shellj, rather .solid; of a 

 pale brown tint, between cinnamon and wood-brown, fading around 

 the umbilicus, having broad white })ands above and below the 

 narrow chestnut-brown shoulder band and crossed by one or several 

 whiti.sh streaks, reminiscent of former peristomes. The surface is 

 semimat. The initial one-fourth whorl is smooth; a 'brief stage of 

 coarse radial wrinkles ensues, followed by fine, short, interrupted 

 radial wrinkles, so short as to be papillae near the upper suture, and 

 sparse, short elevations, arranged in spiral, forwardly descending 

 series. On the second whorl these elevations become di.stinct, rather 

 regular papillse, which persist, in .some examples, upon the third 

 whorl. The last whorl has fine .striai and microscopic wrinkling. 

 The spire is but slightly convex. The whorls increase slowly, the 

 last descends a little in front and is rounded at the periphery and 

 base. The peristome expands very slightly in its lower half, and its 

 edge has a ru.sty tint. It is thickened within by a rather wide but 

 thin white callus, which shows as an opaque buff border behind the 

 lip. The columellar termination is slightly dilated, and the parietal 

 callus moderately thick in fully mature or old individuals.

The shell in this extremely distinct species reminds one a little 

 of Trichodisdna. There is no other Sonorella like it. The embryonic 

 sculpture is a modification of the hachitana pattern. In the genitalia 

 it resembles S. bicipitis of the Dos Cabezas range as much as any- 

 thing. It is abundant in the northern part of the Dragoon Range, 

 but Tweed Canyon apparently forms an inipass:il)l(' harrier to its 

 spread southward. 



We rarely found Sonorella ferrissi sealed to stones, forming small 

 rings. Most living ones were .seen loose under stones or in the 

 earth, lying with the aperture up, like Eastern Helices, and sealed 

 with a somewhat convex white epiphragm. It belongs exclusivt'ly 

 to the iiincstonc terrain.

This species is somewhat related to S. dragooncnsis, hut differs 

 by its smaller size, thinner shell, decidedly smaller umbilicus, and 

 by having the last whorl densely hairy, the hairs extremely short 

 and close. 8. apache differs from S. dragooneyisis rather conspicuouslj^ 

 in soft anatomy. The penis is shorter with a differently constructed 

 papilla; there is no fiagellum; the vagina is much longer and is 

 strongly swollen at the base. The anatomical characters of both 

 have been examined in several specimens from different stations. 



The delicately hairy periostracum will serve to separate S. apache 

 from other species of the genus. It is an extremely distinct species. 



Its home is among the great crags around Cochise Stronghold, a 

 favorite resort of the Apaches. Station 10 is some miles northward 

 of the other stations and at a somewhat greater elevation. 



S. apache was found only in igneous or metamorphic rock, never 

 in the limestone. It was not found sealed to the rock, nor were any 

 white circles seen on the rocks it inhabits, thus differing from nearly 

 all other Sonorellas collected by the authors.

Station 1 is conspicuous from the hillside on the east side of the 

 mouth of Cataract Branch, as a long, bare streak in the dense brush 

 which clothes the slope below the crag at the west side, some distance 

 up the ravine, and rather high on the side. One living shell and 

 numerous "bones" were found by quarrying in the heavy rock of the 

 slide. More living shells were taken at Station 9, the type colony. 



The largest shell seen is a dead individual from Station 27, measur- 

 ing 18.5 mm. in diameter. 



Oreohelii strigosa var. 



A young dead specimen was found at Station 2, under a stone, and 

 two fragments of the last whorl at Station 13; both in the limestone 

 region, but at very different elevations. Station 2 being only a hundred 

 feet or so above the bed of Tweed Canyon, 13 on the highest peak 

 of its rim. The large.st fragment, half of the last whorl of an adult 

 shell, has a diameter of 18.5 mm. It shows a slight peripheral angle, 

 othen\ise resembling 0. s. depressa Ckll. 



This Dragoon species seems from the fragments to be a more 

 depressed shell than the extinct Oreohelix of the Florida Mountains, 

 but it may be the same as the Huachucan race.

A.s we searched the range carefully for Oreohd'ix after finding one 

 on the first day, it is probably extinct, not surviving the destruction 

 of the woods. There remains a possibility that it may survive in 

 some part of the mountains not covered by our collecting stations.

UROCOPTID^. 



Holospira is rarely if ever found on igneous or metamorphic rock; 

 and as the Dragoons are traversed by many dykes, the limestone 

 areas where Holospiras live are divided by tracts barren of these 

 snails. This has resulted in the differentiation of several species 

 which though variable do not intergrade, so far as we know. In the 

 Hacheta Range the limestone is continuous, and while there has 

 been a good deal of chfiferentiation, the several extreme forms are 

 connected by those intermediate in structure and location. 



It must lie admitted that our knowledge of the Dragoon Holospiras 

 is fragmentary. The whole foothill region, where they abound, 

 needs attention. They are ea.sily founri, and in large numbers. 



Holospira danielsi n- sp- PI. XIV. 6g-i. 1 to 3a. 



The shell is cylindric, the upper fourth (or third) tapering to the 

 slightly mamillar, obtuse summit. Tilleul-buff, becoming darker 

 towards the summit. Nearly 2\ eml)ryonic whorls are smooth; 

 then slightly retractive axial ribs appear, rather low and delicate 

 on the first neanic whorl, after which they become strong, widely 

 separated, oblitjue (retractive) on the conical j)()rtion, still more 

 widely spaced and vertical on the cylindric portion of the shell, 

 where the summits of the ril)s are more or less irregular from breakage 

 due to being in part hollow there. On the penultimate whorl there 

 are 13 ribs (more or less). On the last half of t lie last whorl the 

 ribs become clo.ser (or many may be interposed). The whorls are 

 rather strongly convex, the la.st one tapering downwards, being 

 comjjre.ssed below the periphery; base rimate but not perforated. 

 The la.st fourth of the last whorl is somewhat st raightencil but not 

 built forward beyond the level of the ventral fare of the shell, .\per- 

 ture rounded-ovate. Peristonx' narrowly expanded except at the 

 upper outer angle, where it is simple and obtu.se. The axis is rather 

 slender, subefjual excej)t at the ends. In the last i)art of the penult 

 and first part of the la.'<t whorl there is a .strong, short, obtuse rolu- 

 mellar lamella close to the l)a.se; a parietal lamella, much longer 

 and usually strong (and frecjuently a smaller ba.sal lamella).

They live on the most exposed, hottest slopes, often in great 

 profusion, but are not found on the mesa, where //. camyeslris 

 occurs. 



This beautiful snail is very distinct from all of our species by its 

 strong, rude, widely spaced ribs. One of the northwest Mexican 

 Holospiras, H, minima, has the same type of sculpture, though less 

 coarse than in the typical H. danielsi, which is the most strongly 

 costate species known. 



Like other Arizonian Holospiras, the internal lamella? are variable, 

 two or three (parietal and axial, or parietal, axial and basal) being 

 developed. Otherwise the chief variation is in the number of ribs, 

 and also in size. 



Twenty specimens of the type lot, opened, taken at random, 

 measure as follows: 



Length 12, diam. 3.6 mm.; whorls 13; lamellse 2. 




1915.] N.\TL-RAL SCIENCE.S OF PHILADELPHIA. 375 



The .sculpture i.s less varial)le in this lot than in some others. 

 Ten specimens, taken at random, have 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 15, 17, 

 17, 17 ribs on the penultimate whorl. These fairly represent the 

 lot, so far as can be told without extensive counting. None counted 

 have more than 17 ribs (see PI. XIV, figs. 1, la, 16). 



Station 3 (summit of ridge above Station 2), but west of where 

 the trail crosses ridge). Shells exactly like those of Station 2, but 

 pefhaps a little more variable in size, length 9 to 121 mm. in extreme 

 specimens. 



Station 4 (summit of riilge further northwest, several hundred 

 feet higher than Station 3). These shells are conspicuously larger 

 than at Stations 2 and 3. Part of the shells are typical in sculpture, 

 but in most of them the ribs are much more numerous, closer, smooth, 

 and more regularly spaced. These close-ribbed shells agree wnth 

 those from Station 5 and from Station 12, a peak on th(^ opposite 

 (ea.st) side of the rim of the amphitheatre of Tweed Canyon. Proba- 

 bly the close-ribbed type of shell extends around the whole rim 

 from Station 4 to Station 12. 



Two out of fifteen opened have 3 lamellie (both having many riljs), 

 and three have only the columellar lamella (ribs few). The rest, 

 including both many- and few-ribl)ed shells, have 2 lamellie. This 

 lot was picked up in several places along the summit of the narrow 

 ridge, perhaps in an area of 20 x 100 yards. It therefore may com- 

 prise .several colonies, and we cannc^t now tell whether fine- and 

 coarse-ribbed shells occur actually together or not. There may l>e 

 12-15 ribbed colonies and 20-30 ribljed colonies, or possibly both 

 sorts may live together. The measurements give extremes of size 

 and are from "selectcrl*' shells.

 latter part of the penultimate and first part of the last bearing a 

 stout axial lamella. There is also a long and strong parietal or 

 superior lamella, and sometimes a basal lamella. Length 11.5, 

 diam. 3.7 mm.; whorls 12.

 the mesa. Near the mountain the gully deepens to 30 40 feet, the 

 sides become subvertical, and Holospira disappear>. The mesa is 

 grassy with some bunches of bear grass. There are some small oaks, 

 juniiM-r, catclaw, etc., in the arroyo. The shells are found under 

 (lead .sotol and sometimes stones, etc. They reappear jii>t below 

 the igneous dyke near the ba.se of the mountain, Station 17, but do 

 not cross the dyke. Several other arroyos in the same plain were 

 not examined, and there are doubtless many HaUn-pira colonies in 

 the neighborhood. 



Station 1.9, on the slf)pe near foot of mountain, below the igneous

Station 31, hillside, eastern slope of seeoml ravine from granitic 

 spur, up to about 000 feet above bed of ravine. The shells are 

 variable, as would be expected in a lot gathered over a considerable 

 area, having; 35 to oO ribs on the penultimate whorl. Out of 11 opened, 

 one has 3 lamellae, ten iuive two, superior and axial. (PI. XIV, fig. (3.) 



Station 22, in the bed of the same ravine. Shells having about 56 

 ribs on penultimate whorl. Eight opened have 3 very strong lamella. 



Station 23. Between Stations 21 and 2, near top. Like the 

 preceding, lamellae 2 or 3. 



Fig. 2. — Sketch to show positions of collecting stations west of the spur in Tweed

 (below) from those of H . dnniehi (above). 



Station 27. Rather large, length 11 mm. with 12 whorls and 36 

 ribs on the penultimate whorl to 13 mm. long, with 13^ whorls and 

 28 ribs. (PI. XIV, figs. 8 to 86.) This station is in a gulch on the 

 south side of Tweed Canyon, the nearest approach to the area of 

 H. millestriata. It shows no approach to that species in sculpture, 

 which is coarser than in most cochisei. Some of the ri})s were hollow 

 and are broken down, as in //. danielsi. This condition is also seen 

 to a, less degree in some specimens of cochisei from the type locality.

whorls of the cone somewhat more sliarply striate than the cylmdric 

 portion, upon which the striae are very fine and close; typically about 

 90 fine, close strise on the penultimate whorl. The latter part of 

 the last whorl is slightly compressed and has slightly coarser, sharper 

 striae. The aperture is carried very shortly free, is not calloused 

 within, and has a narrowly reflexetl lip. Witiiiu the latter part of 

 the penultimate and first part of the last whorl there is a rather 

 stout, obtuse lamella on the axis. No lamellae on the upper or basal 

 walls of the cavity. 



Length 12, diam. 4 mm.; 12 whorls.

 PiJsbry and Daniels, October, 1910. Also taken at Station 7, and 

 Stations 29 to 37 southward from Stations 7 and 8. 



H. millestriata is related to H. campestris, from which it differs by 

 having more numerous, finer stria-, and by the absence of internal 

 lamelliD on the parietal and ba.sal walls of the cavit}', in a long series 

 of shells opened. Its range is .separated from that of H. campestris 

 by the ridge of eruptive rock which runs from Cochise stronghold 

 along the south side of Tweed Canyon westward to the mesa; no 

 Holospiras being found on this ridge, so far as we know. The isola- 

 tion of the two species seems, therefore, to l)e complete. The species 

 is quite constant in hundreds of shells collected from many colonies, 

 as noted l)elow; but in two stations in small hills on the mesa east- 

 ward of Mifldlcmarch Canyon there is notable variation. Further 

 study should l»e given to these small forms of the border between 

 mountain and plain. In over a hundred shells opened from all the 

 colonies, only one has a very weak trace of a sui)erior lainella. all 

 others having only a stout axial lamella. 



The type locality, Station 7, is on the divide, a ridge above an 

 abandoned mine and eai)in. It may be reached by ascending ( "ata- 

 ract (iulch from Tweed Canyon, but much more easily alc^ng the 

 mountains eastward, as the gulch is rather a neckbreuker. The 

 specimens are cpiite uniform in sculpture. Length up to 12.2 nun., 

 and very rarely as short as 9.3 mm., with 10 whorls. (PI, X\', figs. 

 3, 3a, 36). Out of twenty opened, f)ne has a weak, hardly perceptible 

 trace of the superior I.-imella, the others having the axial lamella 

 only. A series of lOOO or more was taken. It occurs under stones, 

 etc., in places where there is no shade.

Stations 31, 32, on the east side, and Station :VA on the west side

Station 34. A small limestone hill in Middlemarch Canyon. 

 The shells have perceptibly coarser sculptures than in the types, 

 about 70 riblets on the penultimate whorl. One internal lamella, 

 the axial. 



Station 35. Cochise Peak. Similar to the shells from Station 34. 



Station 36. Small limestcme hills eastward on the mesa of Middle- 

 march Canyon. The shells here are smaller than typical millestriata, 

 and vary from the typical fine ribbing to somewhat coarser (PI. XV, 

 figs. 4, 4a, the prevalent form), and a few are as coarsely sculptured 

 as H. campestris cochisei, the coarsest having 48 ribs on the penulti- 

 mate whorl. The proportions of diameter to length also vary a 

 good deal, as shown in the figures and measurements. All the speci- 

 mens opened have a single lamella, the axial.

It is evident that H. millestriata, which is very constant in the

 ecologic conditions of the lower, more arid mesa.

This group is between the southwestern outliers of the Chiricahua 

 Range and the Huachucas, and is much lower than either, the highest 

 summits about 7.000 feet. The greater part of the group is igneous 

 rofk. but the Escabrosa Ridge, running along the western and 

 southern borders, is limestone. Collecting was done in the vicinity 

 of Bisbee and Warren, August 29 and 30, 1910, by Daniels and 

 Pilsbry. We found nothing in the igneous area, but Sonorella 

 probably lives on the higher peaks. 



The Geological Survey has published a topographic sheet of this 

 region. 

 Sonorella bartschi n. sp. Pi. Vin, figs. 4, 4a, 46. 



The shell is strongly depressed, rather openly umbilicate (width 

 of umbiUcus contained nearly six times in the diameter of shell), 

 moderately strong, though thin; color between cinnamon and wood 

 brown, fading to white around the umbilicus, and encircled a])ove 

 the periphery with a dark chestnut band, bordered above and below 

 with white bands, as wide as the dark band or wider. Surface 

 glossy; initial f whorl of the embryonic shell smooth; a few radial 

 wrinkles follow, after which it has radial striae which become more 

 or less interrupted, forming irregular, long granules; beginning with 

 the second whorl, there are short hairs, subregularly placed in for- 

 wardly descending rows; these continue to the penultimate whorl, 

 where they weaken and disappear. The last whorl has a weak sculp- 

 ture of growth wrinkles only. 



Whorls about 4^, rather slowly increasing, convex, the last descend- 

 ing well below the periphery in front. Aperture strongly oblique, 

 subcircular. Peristome thin, expanded rather slightly above, 

 strongly below, the ends approaching and joined bj' a very short 

 but distinct parietal callus.

The peni.s is long, it.s lower half very slender, enveloped in a long 

 sheath composed of glossy circular muscular tissue. The upper 

 half is somewhat swollen. The penis-papilla (fig. la) is rather short, 

 cylindric, ver>' faintly wrinkled transversely, the distal end obtu.se, 

 rounded. The fiagellum is about 0.8 mm. long. The vagina is 

 about half as long as the penis. Other ? organs as usual in the

The shell is quite characteri.stic by its conspicuous white bands 

 bordering the dark band at the shoulder, the rather open umijilicus, 

 and the nearly circular, strongly obliciuc apt-rture. It is a liands(jme 

 snail when fresh, not clo.sely resembling any other species we have 

 seen. Its nearest neighb(jr is .S. mcarn.si Bartsch, from San Jose 

 Mountain, which lies ju.st south of the international boundary near 

 Naco, a railroad station on the El Pa.so and Southwestern H. U. 

 S. mcarnsi ha.s a narrower umbilicus, less conspicuous white bands,

 difference from those of the type locality; but the genitalia (PI. XI,

 adult taken. The penis has scarcely any sheath; only a few fibres 

 bind the epiphallus. Flagellum more minute. Penis-papilla (fig.

 penial retractor is inserted on the epiphallus near its base. The 

 vagina is nearly as long as the penis. Length of penis 10| mm.;

The shell is very shortly rimate, cylindric, with short terminal 

 cone, wood brown or avellaneous, the last half of the last whorl 

 opaque white; composed of 10| to 13| whorls, the first two smooth. 

 The last half of the second and first half of the third whorl are narrower 

 than the preceding and following whorls, as usual, and the apex 

 projects somewhat nipple-like. Following whorls of the cone are 

 quite convex, and are sharply, closely and obliquely striate. On 

 the cylindrical portion the whorls are only weakly convex, and 

 gradually lose the striae, so that the penultimate and often one or 

 two earlier whorls arc smooth or nearly so, the last half-whorl becom- 

 ing strongly, sharply striate again. The last whorl is compressed 

 laterally on the back but becomes rounded near the aperture, pre- 

 ceding which it is .somewhat contracted. The aperture is rotund- 

 ovate, peristome shortly free of the preceding whorl, and quite 

 narrowly expanded. Internal axis rather small, in the last part of 

 the penultimate and the beginning of the last whorl becoming a 

 moderate, obtu.se lamella. Typically there are no other lamellse, 

 l)ut in a small number of specimens a superior lamella, or superior 

 and basal lamellse are developed, both very weak.

 August 29. 1910. 



The Escabrosa Ridge, or mountain side on the left, ascending 

 the first left-hand ravine a!>ove Bisbee on the Tombstone Road, is 

 the home of this Holospira. Extensive burning of the brush has 

 narrowed their range and decreased their numbers, at least for the 

 time, .so that the series collected was not large.' Some very small 

 .scrub oaks remain in places; there are three species of agave, some 

 sotol and bear-grass, a few cylindropuntias, and many herbaceous 

 plants, now after the summer rains gay with flowers; over everything 

 a little scarlet morning-glory, which we afterward found common 

 in the ranges westward. 



Out of 20 shells opened, 18 have the axial lamella only; one has 

 also a small superior or parietal, and one has superior and basal 

 lamella?, both very low and small. 



This is a larger and longer species than //. fcrrissi, and further 

 distinguished by the smooth later whorls and deficient internal 

 lamelljE. The Chiricahuan H. arizo7icnsis Stearns differs chiefly 

 l)y having th(> internal lamella larger. 

 Holospira ferrissi foBsor n. Hubsp. PI. XV. figs. C to «((. 



The short, cylindric shell is ribl)cd throughout, with about 47 ril)s

 on the l)ack, then gil)bous (the gibbosity internally fliled with white 

 •shelly material) and contracting to the a])erture. the basal crest 

 rather consjiicuous. These fj'atures are more conspicuous than in 

 //. fcrri.ssi. There is an obtuse axial lamella in the front of tin' last 

 wh(.)rl, an<l typically no other lamellip; but three specimens out of

of hills wliich reach about 5,500 feet elevation. On the northern 

 and northwestern slopes of one of these, about two miles east of the 

 town, we collected Sonorella, Holospira and some smaller shells. 

 Holospira is very abundant (over 1,500 collected by H. A. P.), 

 living in mellow earth under stones, in "nests" of from six to twenty 

 or more, usually standing vertically, apex up, and buried in earth 

 up to the summit. While the sculpture of this species is coarser 

 than that of typical H. cioneUa, yet there are some equally coarse 

 individuals of the latter. It is quite possible that H. ciouella may 

 eventually be ranked as a subspecies of H ferrissi. 



In the debris of the San Pedro River above the S. P. R. R. bridge, 

 near Benson, Arizona, we found three specimens representing as 

 many races of Holospira. One is the upper half of a slowly tapering 

 species, evidently new. The others are probably races of H. ferrissi. 

 One specimen has the appearance of a small H. f. fossor. It has the 

 same sculpture, a low axial lamella, and measures, length 7.6. diam. 

 3.1 mm., 9f whorls. 



The other shell resembles H. ferrissi in having three internal 

 lamelliE, the .superior and axial lamellae being strongly developed. 

 The ribbing is as fine as in the most finely ribbed ferrissi — decidedly 

 finer than in fossor. The form is more slender than in ferrissi. 

 This shell apparently represents another subspecies or local race 

 of //. ferrissi. As it may have drifted a long distance, it had better 

 be left nameless until found in its natural habitat. 



Holospira ferrissi sanctaecrucis n. subsp. PI. XV, fig. 7. 



The shell is similar to the most slender and fine-ribbed examples 

 of H. ferrissi in form and sculpture, except that the apical whorls 

 are more mucronate. The three internal lamcllce are lateral in posi- 

 tion, .strongly developed, especially the superior one, which is a half- 

 whorl long.

Valley of the Santa Cruz River, above Tucson, Arizona, rype 

 No. 112,239, A. N. S. P., found in flood debris of the river a short

This is some distance west of any other record of Holospira in the 

 United States. In Mexico the genus extends to the Gulf of Cali- 

 fornia. The lamelliE are much stronger than in any of the lot of 

 H. ferrissi which we have opened. 



Although there cannot be much doubt that this .species inhabits 

 some limestone hill not far from the river, we failed to find it in the 

 quite limited time we spent in the neighborhood. It may have

Hoated many miles, a.-^ the river merits that name in time of flood, 

 though usually reduced to a chain of infrequent pools or an insig- 

 nificant rivulet. The term river, in the arid belt, refers to the bed 

 and banks rather than to the water, which is often conspicuous for 

 its ab.sence during a great part of the year.

III. BEN.SON, Arizona. 



Benson, Cochise Co., at the junction of the Southern Pacific and 

 E! Paso and Southwestern Railroads, is in a flat region, with no mol- 

 lusk fauna in its immediate environs. The San Pedro River, flowing 

 northward about a mile east of the town, brings down considerable 

 Ho(k1 debris containing shells. The .source of these is probably in the 

 foothills of the Whetstone Mountains, not far away; possibly also 

 the hill country al)out Tomb.stone, or even further south. 



The San Pedro carries more water than any other stream in the 

 lower tier of counties between the Rio Grande and the Colorado, 

 and so far as we know it is the only one maintaining a constant flow. 

 At Benson it is a turbid .stream 20 to 30 feet wide, with vertical, 

 dirt banks about 8 feet high (September l.st), meandering in a flood 

 plain covered with me.squite. 



Mr. Ferriss collected a few shells from the river drift in 1904; and 

 in 1010 Pilsbr>' and Daniels, having an hour or two between trains, 

 collected a small bag of shell-bearing d(?bris near the S. P. R. R.

 spring. The best collecting is in Walnut Canyon, Station 5. where 

 three species of Sonorella live. From al)ove thi.s camp there is fine 

 timber, but no land shells worth mentioning up to the summit of 

 Mt. Hopkins. Good collecting stations were found in Madtra 

 Canyon which would be an excellent place to camp. We also reached 

 the head of Josephine Canyon from this camp. A two-day excursion

The absence of the cominon western Sonorellas (santaritana and 

 icalkcri) on the eastern slope, and the occurrence there of another 

 species (S. g. occideiUalis) indicates a certain amount of local fauna! 

 differentiation, and it seems likely that work in the northern, southern 

 or eastern jiarts of the range would result in a number of additional 

 species of SonorcUa. By the al)sence of Orcohelix and AshmimeUa 

 (in the jiarts we explored), the Santa Ritas differ remarkably from 

 the Huachucas, the next range eastward. 



We obtained very few small shells.

Specimens from Station 11, and numerous others from Station 5, 

 opened but not measured, were sufficiently examined to show that 

 the specific characters — great length of penis and vagina — are con- 

 stant. 



S. santaritana differs from other species of the same range by its 

 wider umbilicus, the more approaching ends of the lip, and especially 

 by the great length of penis and vagina. In the characters of the 

 genitalia it is nearest to *S. rinconensis P. and F. (these Proceedings 

 for 1909, PI. XXII, fig. 5). That species differs by having a. still 

 longer vagina, and a more capacious shell with larger aperture and 

 relatively smaller umbilicus. S. dalli and S. virilis are somewhat 

 related, but differ in characters of both genitalia and shell. 



This is the mo.st abundant and widely distributed Sonorella of 

 the part of the Santa Rita Range which we explored. 



In size, specimens from Walnut Canyon (PI. IX, figs. 1-26) measured 

 from 19 to 25.8 mm. diameter, but only in one colony were such 

 small ones found, the minimum size in other colonies is about 21.5 

 mm. 



In Stations 10, 11 and 14 they run from 20.4 to 22.5 mm. In 

 other .stations the size is about typical. 



A beautiful albino (PI. IX, fig. 3) was taken at Station 5. It shows 

 very faint traces of the shoulder band and the embryonic shell is 

 faintly buff, but othenvi.se it is pure white. Genitalia as in the 

 colored form.

The surface is glos.sy, ligiitly marked witli growth hues, and

are conspicuous characters. The smaller umbilicus and less de- 

 pressed contour sej^arate it from S. santantaiia, which also differs 

 more fundamentally by its genitalia. .S. ivalkcri is very nmch like 

 «S. clappi in soft anatomy. Its relation to S. huachvcana Pils. 

 remains to be defined when that species shall have been dissected. 

 Measurements of the organs in mm. follow. 



Sonorella walkeri agnacalientensis n. subsp. PI. IX, figs. 5, 5a. 5b, C, Ga, 06. 



A form witli the shell not constantly distinguishable from *S. 



walkeri was found in sohk^ abundance at Stations 1 and 2, in the 



mouth of Agua Caliente 

 Canyon. Station 1 is in 

 rocks on the bank of the 

 wash running out of the 

 canyon, immediately- 

 southeast of the fine 

 spring of tepid water 

 which gives this canyon 

 its name. This is the 

 lowest Station for any 

 snail found in these 

 mountains, the elevation 

 being about .3,800 feet. 

 All of the alcoholic speci- 

 mens of this lot were lost 

 after leaving the moun- 

 tains, so that the ana- 

 tomical characters are 

 unknown. The shells 

 measure 19 to 24 mm. in 

 diameter and live in 



crevices or under fragments of a friable, shale-like rhyolite, of a dark 



vinaceous-drab color. See PI. IX, figs. 6, 6a, 66.

Station 2, at the ba.se of bluffs southea.st of Station 1 and .somewhat 

 higher, afforderl a few similar shells (PI. IX, figs. 5, oa, 56). One 

 preserved in spirit differs from S. walkeri by having a decidedly 

 longer penis, penis-papilla and epiphallus. There is no flagellum, 

 and no penial retractor muscle was found. (Fig. 5.) These differ- 

 ences, if confirmed by further dissections, in our opinion, indicate 

 a distinct species; but to direct attention to it we now rank the 

 race as a subspecies of S. walkeri. The diameter at Station 2 runs 

 from 22.3 to 24 mm. The elevation of this Station is between 

 4.100 and 4,200 feet, according to the topographic map.

Walnut branch of Agua Caliente; ami Station;> 17 and 17^, Camperel 

 Canyon, on the eastern slope of the mountains, at alwut 6,500 feet. 



This is a smaller, thinner shell than otlier Santa Hita Sonorellas, 

 and readily distinguished by its microscopic granulation and the 

 beautiful sculpture of the embryo. It is variable in degree of eleva- 

 tion of the spire, size of umbilicus and color. In Madera Canyon 

 the shell has a ru.sset hue. 



In Walnut Branch of Agua Caliente the color ranges from almo.st 

 chamois in the thicker old individuals to nearly water green in those 

 barely grown to full size. The microscopic granulation is sometimes 

 typically developed on the last whorl, but more often more or less 

 obsolete, sometimes only visible in a few places; and most specimens 

 show incised spiral lines on the last whorl, occasionally quite distinct 

 and numerous. Around the head of Agua Caliente Canyon the color 

 is similar to the Walnut Branch lot. 



.S. clappi resembles the Huachucan S. granulatissima and S. 

 danielsi in the embrj-onic sculpture and the general appearance, but 

 in those species the aperture is more oblique than usual in *S'. clappi 

 and the genitalia are conspicuously different. Having dissected a 

 good many individuals of all of these species, I feel confident that 

 the genitalia afford the most reliable specific characters. »S. clappi 

 is ver>' much like »S. walkeri in genitalia. 



A couple of shells from Station 17^, Camperel Canyon, on the 

 eastern slope of the range, resemble the Agua Caliente form in being 

 light colored. One from Station 17, in the same canyon, is the 

 darkest of all, being nearly a sorghum-brown color, more vinaceous 

 where the cuticle is worn off. The genitalia (PI. XII, figs. 4, 4a) 

 differ from typical S. clappi by the longer penis and penis sheath, 

 and the shorter vagina. Length of penis 13, penis-papilla 10, epi- 

 phallus 10, fiagellum 1, vagina 4^ mm. 



A bleached Sonorella, No. 105,385, U. S. N. M., collected, or at 

 least sent to Dr. I. Lea in 18G0, by H, C. Grovenor, is labelled "Santa 

 Rita Mountains, 6,000 feet above the sea." It is very thin and 

 appears under the lens to have been granular. The lip-ends con- 

 verge, as in *S. clappi, from which this shell differs by its larger size 

 and less depressed shape; diam. 20.5 mm. It is probably a distinct 

 species related to >S'. clappi, but it is not in condition for description. 

 The spire is broken. 

 Sonorella granulatiBsima occidentalis n. subsp. PI. IX, figs. 7, 7o, lb.

V. Small Ranges and Hills of the Santa Cruz River V.a.lley. 



Between Tucson and Nogales and the Santa Rita and Baboquivari 

 Mountains there are many buttes and ranges of hills or small moun- 

 tains, a few of which we visited, finding in each a special species of 

 Sonorella and sometimes a few small shells. 



.\mong the more important ranges which should l)e investigated 

 we may mention the Tumacacori (or Atascoso) range, an extensive 

 ma.ss of arid looking mountains, extending south to the Mexican 

 line, and prol)ai)ly supporting little but Sonorella. They are easily 

 accessible from the Sonora R. R., l)eing about miles from "Siding 

 No. 4. " The.se mountains on the south pass into the Sierra de los 

 Pajaritos, which lie west of Nogales — "a confused ma.ss of rocky 

 crags, peaks, flat-topped mountains with vertical sides, enormous 

 trachyte dykes, steep narrow ridges and deep canyons." They are 

 cdvcrcd with "a fine growth of oak, juniper and manzanita. while 

 magnificent walnut, .sycamore and ash trees line the canyons." 

 Water supply precarious except in the wet sea.sons. These fine 

 mountains are unknown to the conchologist. 



\'arious species reported from Tucson were certainly brought 

 there from more or le.ss distant localities. Sonorella (jranula(ii<)<ini(i, 

 reported by Bart.^^ch, Smiths. Misc. Coll., Vol. 47. p. V.VA, and Ash- 

 nnitidUi Ktriaferd Ancey are Huachucan species. The following 

 sjx'cies were taken in the drift debris of the Santa Cruz River, near 

 Tucson, chiefly above the bridge. The fresh-water shells art- mainly 

 fossils, washed out of, or exposed upon the low dirt banks, where 

 the stream has cut down through a former cicncyu. Part of the land 

 .-hells proi)ably wa-lied in from the Tumamoc and other eastern 

 foothills of the Tucson Rang<'. We found liiji<l(iriii (uhii and Thynun- 

 ophorn hornii on the Tumamoc Hills, and with other minutia*, in 

 debris washed down from the hills at the hill terminus of Congress St.

 Apical sculpture is of the hachitana type, but usually very weak, the 

 initial half-whorl smooth, without the usual radial ripples; the 

 rest of the embryonic shell is marked with a few delicate, interrupted 

 tangential (protractive) threads, on a nearly smooth ground, having 

 weak growth ripples only. The subsequent neanic and last whorls 

 have weak growth lines. Whorls 4^, convex, the last .slowly de-

Tumamoc Hill, near Tucson. Pima Co., Arizona. Types No. 

 112.245. A. X. S. P., collected by Ferriss, Pilshry and Daniels, 

 October 1, 1910; topotj-pes in collections of Ferriss and Daniels. 

 Specimens were taken by Mr. J. C. Blumer under volcanic cliffs 

 on the northeast side of Cat Mountain, in the Tucson Range. 



The shell closely resembles »S. eremita of the Mineral Hill group, 

 but it is much thinner with the peristome decidedlj^ less expanded 

 and the eml^ryonic whorls smoother. The penis is very much 

 longer than in eremita. A comparison with the unique type of 

 S. arizonensis Dall, kindly made by Dr. Paul Bartsch, shows that 

 that species is quite distinct. 



We would be disposed to consider tumamocensis a subspecies of 

 S. rowelli were it not that in individuals having the shell about the 

 same size as rowelli the penis, penis-papilla, epiphallus and vagina 

 are about twice as long; the spermathecal duct remaining about 

 equal in the two species. The shape of the penis-papilla is different, 

 that of tumamoce7i^is being longer, slender and tapering. For 

 comparison we have added measurements of the organs of S. rowelli 

 to the table on p. 408. The columellar lip dilates much less than in 

 S. comobabiensis or .S. sitiens. 



The penis is ver>' much longer, its papilla both absolutely and 

 relatively much shorter than in S. papagorum. 



The Tumamoc Hills are an outlying spur of the Tucson Range, 

 about a mile from Tucson west of the Santa Cruz River. There are 

 three hills: Tumamoc, 3,092 feet, on the northern slope of which 

 the Desert Botanical Lalvoratory of the Carnegie Institution of 

 Washington stands; Sentinel, 2,885 feet, and a lower nameless hill 

 of 2,672 feet elevation. The hills are volcanic, formed of an old 

 andesite f]ow, largely covered by rhyolite (which is the characteristic 

 rock of the Tucson Range) and later flows of basalt.^ Sonorella 

 occurred in great piles of black basalt, on the north slope of Tumamoc 

 Hill, from just below the flat summit down half way to the Desert 

 Laboratory'. Most of them were taken not far from the 2,750-foot 

 contour (our Station 35). Living snails are very scarce and hard 

 to get. None were found on the other slopes of Tumamoc Hill, 

 nor could we find them on Sentinel Hill. On the 2,672-foot hill, 

 at the end of Congress St., we took only Bifidaria tuba. 



^ Topographic and geological maps of these hills, with accounts of their physical 

 features and vegetation, may be found in the following publications of the Carnegie 

 Institution of Washington: D. T. Macdougal: Botanical features of North 

 American deserts, 1908. Volney M. .Spalding: Distribution and movements of 

 desert plants, 1909.

404 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [.lunc, 



Black M«)unt;uu is a rather rcinotc and isolalctl outlier of the 

 Tucson Range, which has here its southeastern terminus. It is a 

 long, straight. level-toiijK'd ridge, divided by '-^ tleep gap into a 

 longer ami a sln)rter mountain. The slopes are everywhere very 

 steep, covered with black basalt, like Tumamoc Hill at Tucson. 

 Slides of this rock occupy a Iwrge jiart of the slopes. Between the 

 slitles, which are. of course, barren of vegetation, there is some desert 

 verdure. Ocotillo, mesquite, cat-claw, palo verde, etc., are typical 

 plants, and giant cacti grow on the south side. No agave or sotol 

 were seen. The Sonorellas are found rather deep in the slides. 

 They probably inhabit the whole northern slope, but we w^orked 

 only a couple of hours, on the north side of the east end, close under 

 the sunnnit. Some hazard attends the hunt in these slides, which 

 are s® steep that the heavy rock starts to move on small provocation. 

 Black Mountain, like the rest of the Tucson Range, is very dry. 

 It stands on a plain much lower than the Mineral Hill group and 

 higher than Tucson. The station where Sonorella was collected 

 we would roughly estimate as 3,200 or 3,300 feet above the sea. 

 Sonorella eremita n. sp. PI. VIII, figs. 7 to 7e. 



The shell is globose-depressed, umbilicate (the width of umbilicus 

 contained about 6§ times in the diameter of shell), more solid than 

 other species of the same region, glossy, pinkish buff, fading to nearly 

 white around the umbilicus, and having a chestnut-brown shoulder 

 band, without noticeable light l)orders. The embryonic shell, of 

 about I3 whorls, has strongly developed sculpture of the hachitana 

 type. The initial half -whorl has some radial ripples or wrinkles; 

 then there appears a series of long, protractive threads on the outer 

 two-thirds, meeting shorter forwardly ascending threads on the 

 inner third; the intervals occupied by short radial impressions. 

 The threads are subject to more or less interru])tion, particularly 

 on the greatest convexity of the whorl. The later whorls are marked 

 with very fine, unequal growth-lines. 



The spire is very low, conoidal. Whorls 4§, moderately convex, 

 the last .slowly descending in front. The oblique aperture is rounded, 

 but slightly wider than high. Peristome slightly expanded above, 

 the outer and basal margins expanding more, slightly thickened, 

 the margins converging, connected by a very thin parietal film.

There was a scalariform specimen among the hones. It measures 

 13.3 ram. high, 16.6 wide. The normal height for a shell of this 

 diameter should be about 9.5 mm. 



The Mineral Hill group, T^in Buttes and Tinaja Hills are nmch 

 degraded outliers of the Sierrita Mountains. Only the Mineral 

 Hill group has been worked for land snails, though all doubtless 

 have Sonorellas — and ver>' little else. 



The Mineral Hills are about 20 miles west of south from Tucson 

 and about 7 miles north of the Sierritas.* They stand at the summit 

 of a long slope, rising about 1,000 feet in ten miles from San Xavier 

 del Bac, on a mesa of perhaps 3,600 feet elevation. The xerophytic 

 vegetation extends over the hills, mesquite, cat-claw, palo verde, 

 ocotillo and sotol being the more conspicuous plants, to which may 

 be added tree cacti on southern slopes, and on the mesa many opun- 

 tias, cylindropuntias and a few barrel cacti and yuccas. The 

 absence of Ayave is peculiar. These hills are a favorite resort of 

 rattlesnakes. I got also a coral snake. No mollusks whatever 

 were found on Mineral Hill or Helmet Peak. San Xavier Hill is 

 composed of white subcarboniferous limestone, like the hills south- 

 eastward, except at the western end, which is whitish quartz, with a 

 spur to the north of coarse pinkish-gray granite. There is a depres- 

 sion in this end of the hill, between short, low cliffs of white quartz. 

 The cliff towards the south has partly fallen in a tumble of huge 

 blocks with some smaller stone between them. This talus is perhaps 

 200 feet long to the last scattered blocks, and at the widest 40 feet 

 wide; its lower end about 200 feet above the mesa. In it we found 

 the Sonorella described above. "Bones" were abundant, ])ut living 

 snails extremely scarce, and confined to the deeper portions of the 

 talus, between the piled-up quartz blocks. The entire range of this 

 species is not much greater than the area occupied by a moderate- 

 sized hou.se. In this in.significant fa.stncss it is making a last stand 

 against extermination. 



We found no snails in a hill covered with granite boulders about 

 3 miles north of west from San Xavier Hill. It is possible, though 

 unlikely, that some insignificant colony may exist there. 



* While there we occupied a comfortable camp at the copper mine of Mr. 

 L. D. ChiLson, of Tucson, whose courtesy we would here acknowledge.

 cinnamon colored (varying in tone), paler around the umbilicus, 

 encircled by a chestnut-brown band at the shoulder, bordered with 

 a white band above and below. Surface somewhat glossy. The 

 initial fourth of a whorl is smooth; the rest of the embryonic shell 

 has very fine, ana.stomosing and interrupted radial wrinkles, and on 

 some specimens there are the faintest traces of spiral threads. The 

 neanic and last whorls are marked with tlelicate growth lines. Spire 

 low; whorls 4^, convex, the last slowly descending in front. Aper-

 The penis-papilla is extremely short and wide, cylindric, with a few 

 annular corrugations and a shortly conic end. The ejiiphallus is 

 slender, swollen at its distal end, without trace of a fiagellum. The 

 lower part of the vagina is very stout. Other organs as usual.

The shell is less solid than .S'. cremiia, tiie ajjerture decidedly larger, 

 the umbilicus smaller. The color al.so is darker. It differs from 

 cremitn conspicuously in the genitalia, the penis of N. sitiens being 

 provided with a sheath of half its length, and the papilla being 

 extremely short and stout, while in S. cremitn the sheath is repre- 

 sented only by a few loose muscular fil)res at the ba-^^e, and the 

 papilla is very slender and comparatively long. No other Sonorilld 

 known has a penis-papilla like that of .S. sitiens. Several specimen.s 

 dissected are entirely similar in genitalia.

The most closely related .species seems to be S. rowelli. This, 

 however, has a larger penis-papilla and a slightly wider umbilicus. 



The low and inconspicuous range Las Gijas (the Quartz Hills) 

 lies south of the well-known landmark Cerro Colorado, and west of 

 the northern end of the Tumacacori Range. At the northwest 

 end there is a mine, and a ranch building stands on the bank of a 

 small stream, the Gija Wash. The hill above the mine is strewn 

 with rounded boulders of coarse-grained granite, weathering to 

 angular gravel. Most of the loose rock is too massive to move, .so 

 that suitable situations for .snails are scarce. We found the first 

 Sonorellas on the slope above the mine. Working up over the 

 rounded top of the hill and along the ridge a half mile south we 

 crossed a low rock dyke, where a few more shells and a large colubrine 

 snake were taken. None were found among the rocks at the head 

 of the canyon east of this ridge. The other hills at this end of the 

 range are rountled, grassy, with little rock. On top there is much 

 sotol, ocotillo, a few cacti, etc. We found the pygmy Agave parvi- 

 flora here. It was not seen elsewhere. 



In the debris of the Gija Wash we found Thysanophora hornii 

 (Gabb), Zonitoides minuscula (Binn.) and Bifidaria pelleucida hor- 

 deacella (Pils.).

 eastern end of the range. T\iDes No. 112,160, A. N. JS. P., collected 

 by Pilsbry and Ferri.ss, September 28, 1910. 



The first two measurements are of cotypes from the south .side of 

 the crag. The third specimen measured is the only adult shell taken 

 on the north side of the crag, perhaps a hundred feet higher. 



This form stands ver>' elo.se to S. sitiens, yet the difference in the 

 size of uml)ilicus is constant in the .small series examined; no com- 

 munication l)etween the colonies of Cerro Colorado and Las Gijas 

 can have taken place for a very long period, so that in the present 

 state of our knowledge it seems projxr t(» keep the forms of the two 

 hill-groups subspecifically separate. 



rnfortunately, no living examples were found, so tli:i1 tlie ana- 

 tomical characterization of the subspecies remains to be worked out. 



The Cerro Colorado ("Red Hill") lies a few hours' travel north of 

 Las (lijas. The northern slopes are gras.sy and rounded, but west 

 and .south it is carved into bold. fanta.stic crags and pinnacles of 

 dull red rliyolite — a landmark which catches the eye for a long distance. 



Our work here was brief. Scarcely an hour was spent around a 

 crag which stands at the .southea.stern extremity, about two miles 

 from the Cerro Colorado Mine on the .\ravaca Road. Here the 

 Sonorrlln descriiu'd above was taken, only a few dead specimens. 

 No doubt, the cliffs westward, higher up, would yield better results, 

 though little can be expected in such a dry situation. Neighl)oring 

 low crags of milk-white (piartz, at a lower level .southward, were 

 fouml barren.

 white arountl the umbilicus, usually with a white streak on the last 

 whorl, left by a former resting stage, and with white hands above 

 an^l below the rather wide chestnut-brown shoulder band. The 

 apical sculpture is of the sitiens type, but some interrupted, descend-

 in a slide of volcanic rock on the north side of the highest peak, 

 about 3.000 feet elevation. All were collected by ]\Ir. J. C. Blumer,. 

 of Tucson, in the course of botanical exploration. 



About 120 specimens were collected, some of them showing the 

 surface and color unimpaired, though all were dead shells. We are 

 therefore unable to give any information on the soft parts. The 

 shell is very much like S. sitiens of Las Gijas, further south, and east 

 of the Baboquivari Range; but on account of the wide separation of 

 the localities, it is likely to be subspecifically or even specifically 

 distinct. 



The Comobabi Mountains form a short range, about 75 miles 

 west of Tucson. The Cababi Hills, immecHately west, and the 

 Qui-i-tomoc Hills, a short distance south, are parts of the same 

 group. It is evidently rich in shells, as Mr. Biumer found S. s. 

 comobabi ensis on the highest peaks (near the south end) of both 

 Comobabi and Cababi. and a form which we cannot distinguish 

 from .S. vespertina on the north side of the largest peak of the Qui-i- 

 tomoc Hills. Somewhere in the Cababi Mountains, the exact location 

 not given, Mr. Frank Cole collected two forms, which we provision- 

 ally refer to .S. ashmuni as varieties; one of them is the largest 

 Sonorella known.

This is one of the largest species, XQvy much resembling S. nshmuni'

 separated by the depression of the Gila River, they will probably 

 turn out to be distinct when the genitalia of. both are examined; 

 but as no differences which could reasonably be called specific appear 

 in a close comparison of the types, we rank the southern form as a 

 Eubspecies.

 22.2 (2), 22.3, 22.4, 22.5 (3), 22.6, 22.7, 23, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4. 



We are in some doubt about the .status of this form, but it i.s 

 readily separable from .S. a. aipnx in tlie .series seen. The genitalia 

 when examined will no doubt clear uj) the uncertainty.

\I. The Baboquivari Mountains. 



Wf had not intended at first to visit the Bal>o(iuivaris. From 

 our camp, above 7,000 feet in the Santa Ritas, the lonj!; ridjic, sixty 

 miles ilistant, hounded the western horizon. We could sec the 

 wonderful olielisk of Baboquivari Peak catch the morning sun 

 while the great valley between slept in dusk. At evening it stood 

 •silhouettetl, velvet black, l)etween the purj^le valley and Haming sky. 

 To visit this range, beyond which there is no water, became an 

 obsession, and finally we made the two-day journey- by wagon, 

 camping midway on Sopori Creek, where there was a little stagnant 

 water for the horses. 



The Baboquivari Range is a single, long, north and south ridge with 

 numerous short lateral spurs-. Its chief landmark, Baboquivari 

 Peak, is a huge obelisk of dull red rhyolite, standing on the main 

 axis of the range, flat topped, its sides practically vertical. The 

 foothills and lower slopes of the range have many barrel cacti, 

 opuntias, agaves, very few giant cacti. The lower courses of the 

 canyons are green with mesquite and cat-claw. The higher moun- 

 tains are grassy and lack large cacti; oniy a flat Mamillaria and the 

 little rainbow cactus were noticed. There is gome scattering oak, 

 size of a peach tree, on western and northern slopes, and very few 

 stunted pinyons around the high crags. The herbaceous plants are 

 chiefly the same as in the Santa Ritas. Sycamore Canyon has a 

 richer sylva — button wood, walnut, hackberry, a fine dark-leaved 

 species of oak, etc. There is water in Oro Fino and Sycamore 

 Canyons, and we found some also near the head of Thomas Canyon, 

 about half a mile below the peak. Near the mouth of Sycamore 

 there was in 1910 a foresters' house (which we occupied), a corral 

 and a pump. Much further up there is running water. Our collect- 

 ing stations, enumerated below, are shown on the accompanying 

 sketch map.^ 



The following collecting stations were found: 



Station 21. Mr. Mildred, north side of the butte at .summit of 

 the talus slope. 



* We are indebted to Professor R. H. Forbe.s, of the University of Arizona, for 

 information correcting the names we had heard of the canyons. Sycamore 

 Canyon is also known as Hrown's or \\'a.sson and Brown's Canyon. Sabino 

 Otero has for many years ranged cattle in this canyon, and from this some persons 

 have called it Otero Canjon. We were also given the name Habcjquivari Canyon 

 for Oro Fino Canyon. Xo topographic map has been published, so that hasty 

 note-book sketches made b\' one of us in course of a hnig day's tramj) from Oro 

 Fino Canyon to the Peak and down to camp in Sycamore Canyon, have been 

 utilized to locate our type localities.

 some radial wrinkles, the rest of the embryonic shell without any 

 distinct sculpture, though there is some extremely indistinct radial 

 roughness, stronger near the suture. In fresh young shells of 2^ 

 whorls the surface of the last embryonic and first neanic whorls 

 is densely set with very short hairs, extending also over the base. 

 These are fugacious, lost with further growth. The later whorls 

 are marked with the usual growth lines. Whorls 4^, the last rapidly

 and Daniels. Also on the north side of the highest peak of the 

 Qui-i-tomoc Hills, J. C. Blumer. 



This species is readily distinguished from .S. baboquivariensis by 

 the \\'ider umbilicus, smaller aperture, the shorter, steeper descent 

 of the la.'^t whorl to the aperture, and the absence of distinct sculpture 

 on the embr\'onic whorl; also by the very different genitalia. 



By the small penis and slender, tapering penis-papilla, .S. vespertina 

 is clo.sely related to .S. tumamocensis and .S. eremita. In shell charac- 

 ters it comes ver>' clo.se to S. ^itiens, which differs by the form of its 

 peni.s-papilla. 



.S. vespertina was found at our only collecting station we.^^t of the 

 summit of the range, but it occurred there in considerable abundance. 

 Over 100 living individuals and numerous "bones" were taken by 

 two of us in ab(mt tliree-ciuartcrs of an hour, in the course of our

 sheath ctnnposed of firm, circular muscles. The papilla (fig. 1, pp.) 

 is cylindric, with a conic, glandiform end. The retractor muscle is 

 inserted on the epiphallus, which is nearly as long as the penis, and

Baboquivari Mountains, the types No. 111,549, A. N. S. P., from 

 Station 25, in the head of Thomas Canyon about half a mile from 

 Baboquivari Peak. Also at Station 23, at the northern bases of 

 crags at summit of the spur which divides Thomas Canyon. In 

 Sycamore Canyon, at Station 26, in a slide on the ridge of the head 

 branch, about 300 feet or more below the summit; Station 27, about 

 1,000 feet lower, near bed of canyon; Station 28, still lower, and 

 Station 31, further down the canyon, low on the .south side. 



In Oro Fino Canyon it was taken at Station 21, at the foot of the 

 cliffs on north side of Mount ]\Iildred, l conspicuous butte at the 

 southern side of the mouth of the canyon; also Station 22, among 

 low crags near the north side of the canyon. 



This is the common species of the Baboquivaris throughout the 

 short section of the range which we explored. It is distinguished by 

 having a larger aperture than any other Sonorella known. The 

 rather long penis with a strong basal .sheath and a papilla of very 

 peculiar and characteristic shape are diagnostic of the soft anatomy, 

 and confirmed in a number of individuals from several stations. 



All of the stations are on the eastern watershed of the range. The 

 only collecting station on the western slope (24) had a quite different 

 Sonorella, S. vespertina. 



The size is smaller in Oro Fino Canyon. At Station 22 the shells 

 are decidedly more .solid and more opaque than the types. Height 

 12, diam. 18 mm. to height 13, diam. 19.5 mm.; 4^ whorls. Soft 

 anatomy is typical. 



Specimens from high on the ridge near the head of Sycamore Can- 

 yon, Station 26, are also rather small, diam. 18 to 19.3 mm. Near 

 the bottom of the canyon, at Station 27, the shells measure 19 to

THE DIVERSITY OF ECOLOGIC CONDITIONS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON" THE 

 RICHNESS OF FLORAS. 



BY .lOHX W. HARSHBERGER, PH.D. 



The ecologic conditions of vegetation arc those which are coi> 

 nectefl with the influence of the environment on the |)hin;s. The 

 factors whicli influence the growth and the distribution of species 

 may be divided into Climatic, Edaphic, Physiographic, Biotic, and 

 Chronologic (Cleologic-Historic). The climatic factors include the 

 influence of temperature, moisture, light and wind. The edaphic 

 factors are connected with the conditions of the soil. The physio- 

 graphic factors are concerned with the ]ihysical structure of the 

 geosphere (land surface) and the hydrosphere (water surface) of 

 our planet. The biotic factors are those in which plants and animals 

 (including man) are influential. The chronologic factors deal with 

 the past geologic and paleont(jlogic conditions of the earth, whih' the 

 hi.storic data are concerned chieflx' with the past distribution of 

 plants and their probabh' successional history. The diversity of 

 ecologic conditions is the (hverse character of the ehiiiate, soil. 

 physiography, life and chr<>noh)gy of any region. 



The richness of a flora may l)e considered from a numlnr ot" dilTerent 

 points of view. We may consider it numerically, that is the actual 

 number oi sj)ecies: or we may consider its richness in generic types, in 

 endemic types, in introduced plants, in common plants, in rare plants. 

 in relict species, in l)iologic forms (such as xerophytes, hytlrophytes) 

 and in growth forms (trees, shrubs, lianes) or in the ty|)es suggested 

 first by Haunkiaer. namely, the phaiierophytes. the chama'phytes. the 

 hemicryptoi)hytes, the helophytes and the geo|)hytes. If we use the 

 system of Haunkiaer and arrange the above types by percent ag«'S, 

 then we would have a climatic spectrum which would enable us to 

 make a comparison with the li»»ras of other land> and climes simi- 

 larly arranged. .\n attemjjt will be made to -tudy tin- diversit\ of 

 ecologic conditions and its intlueiice on the richness of the floras of 

 a numb<'r of ditTerent phytogeographic regions of North .\merica. 

 Those regions will be ehosen with which the writer i- imirc or less 

 familiar, and regions which have been studied earefull\ by other 

 botanists and their floras cutalogued.

The rofiions of little i)hysio^raphi(' diversity are the toliowiti^: 

 Point Peleo, Ontario, jutting into Lake Erie, comprises tiial part of 

 Essex County at the western end of the hike, and in tlie enumeration 

 of its plants those found on Pelee Island are included. Point Pelce 

 is a triangular piece of land with its acute anji;le running about 

 <) miles south into Lake Erie. About nine-tenths of this tra(;t is 

 mostly a very wet marsh between the east anil west Ix'aches. Within 

 this marsh limit are several ponds and small lakes, while on the east 

 antl west sides are narrow low, sandy • beaches, the western one 

 l)acked by sand dunes. Outside the marsh the land is sandy. No 

 geographic configuration could be nuieh more simi)le. ('. K. Dodge' 

 has found 466 genera and 623 species of ferns and seed plants on 

 Point Pelee. The generic coefficient, which is the proportion of 

 genera to species in a flora, is for the Point flora 74.7 per cent. 



The pine-barren region of New Jersey is a country of slight relief. 

 The soil is sandy, underlaid by gravel. The streams which flow into 

 the Atlantic Ocean have nowhere a rapid current, and their mouths 

 are influenced by tide water. The hills are low, the steeper ones 

 having gradual slopes. Natural lakes are small and widely scattered. 

 The lower drainage levels are occupied by marshes and swamps. 

 With this simple topography we find a numerically poor flora of 

 250 genera and ooo species of native plants, so that the generic 

 coefficient is 45 per cent. 



Hartsville, South Carolina, the flora of which has been investigated 

 by Coker,' is found on the inner drier part of the Atlantic coastal 

 plain. Just north of the town proper is a rapid descent of about 

 50 feet into the valley of Black Creek. This valley with certain 

 irregularities extends approximately one-half mile and is terminated 

 on its northern edge by sand hills, which rise in gentle undulations. 

 The general surface configuration of the country south of Black 

 Creek Valley is that of a level plain with slight elevations and depres- 

 sions, some of the latter cut by the streams. The nature of the 

 vegetation on the level plain is determined very largely by the 

 position of the water surface in the soil. The flora, as enumerated 

 by Coker, includes 344 genera and 628 species of plants, which gives 

 us a rather higher generic coefficient of 54.6 per cent. 



The Altamaha Crit Region of Georgia, whose flora has been 

 investigated by Harper, has fairly uniform environmental conditions.

Harper' finds that there are 404 genera and 797 species of plants, 

 givinfj;, therefore, a generic coefficient of 50 per cent. 



Miami Plorida, is situated on the ooUtic Umestone formation of 

 south I'lorida.* The flat, featureless country is relieved by short 

 streams which drain the Everglades (of simple topography) into 

 the Atlantic (Jcean. The sea beaches are of silicious sand. Small 

 enumerates 466 genera and 796 species in his Flora of Miami, and 

 the calculated generic coefficient is, therefore, 50 per cent. 



The Florida Keys-^ are of even simpler configuration liiaii the 

 adjoining mainland. There are no running streams and the lime- 

 stone soil is singularly porous. Besides, the islands are narrow and 

 their shores are rocky, of calcareous sands, or nmd-fringed. The 

 entire number of genera is, according to Small, 346 and the number 

 of species is 533, giving the exceptionally high coefficient of (>5 per 

 cent. 



Selecting a number of other localities, we find that the vegetation) 

 of the upper Suscjuelianna'' in New York and Pennsylvania is de- 

 veloped on a soil of glacial origin, in fact the whole region was glaci- 

 ated. Here there is a relatively rich flora of 462 genera and 1105 

 species of seed plants anrl ferns. The generic coefficient of the upper 

 Susquehanna flora, is, therefore, 41.8 per cent. 



Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, is in a region of rich, agricultural 

 development, which has been dependent on the limestone soils, 

 suitable to the tobacco plant, which thrives upon such s(jils without 

 depleting seriou-sly the natural mineral fertilizers. The county is 

 in the rolling Piedmont district where the hills are rounded, tlip 

 streams quiet and the t<;pography comparatively simple and unmoun- 

 tainous with broad, fertile valleys between the ranges of hills. Tin 

 Susfjuehanna Hiver runs along the western boundary f(»r aliout 

 forty miles and for over one-half of this distance it passes through a 

 canyon with .steep sides and a .southern exposure where plants of a 

 more southern distribution are at liome. Sphagnum swamps among 

 the hills have a more northern flora. Shale and sandstones border 

 the northern part of the county, and south of the middle belt of 

 limestone, schi.stic rocks occur with some outcrops of s«rpentine.

As a general rule, the smaller the area of land, the more simple 

 and uniform the configuration of that country. Th(>re are of course 

 exceinions to this fact. Fjurtunately, we have two floras from which 

 we can draw conclusions. Daniels^ has studied the flora of Columbia, 

 Missouri, and vicinity and Mackenzie'-* has enumerated the plants 

 of Jackson County, the same State. Columbia is in the tension belt 

 between forest and prairie. The prairie vegetation is that of Illinois 

 and Iowa; the forest vegetation is that of the Ozark Plateau of 

 Missouri and northern Arkansas. The bottoms of the Missouri 

 River bring hither the alluvial flora and in the ponds and marshes 

 occurs the hydrophytic flora of the eastern United States. Jackson 

 County is bounded on the north by the Missouri River. There are 

 river sand bars, high and rocky bluffs, and an uneven country 

 threaded by small rivers. Prairie country lies between the streams. 

 Barrens are found wliere the limestone rocks are covered by a thin 

 soil, with a bog region found along the Missouri bluffs west of Sibley. 

 Daniels lists 435 genera and 1058 species of plants about Columbia. 

 The generic coefficient is 41.1 per cent. Mackenzie enumerates 

 500 genera and 1141 species in the flora of Jackson County with a 

 calculated generic c(jefficient of 43.8 per cent. 



The Pacific coast flora also illustrates the same principle first 

 enunciated by Jaccard,"* that the generic coefficient is inversely 

 proportional to the diversity of the ecologic conditions. Hall" has 

 writt»n one of the best local floras extant. The Yosemite National 

 Park presents a great variety of conditions, but as compared with 

 the central Rocky Mountain region or the entire Sierra Nevada 

 chain its topography is less diversified. Here, however, we find 

 springs, creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes and glaciers with rocky outcrops, 

 gravelly ridges and steep precipices. The irregular topography 

 gives rise to .southward-facing .slopes which receive the full effect 

 of the sun's rays, as well as northward slopes, where it is moist and 

 shady. The altitude ranges from 2500 feet to 13,090 feet along the 

 orest of the Sierra Nevada. If an enumeration is made of the

plants in Hall's Yosemite Flora, wo get. omitting the grasses, 

 sedges, rushes and varietal forms, a total of 741 species and 311 genera 

 \\ith a generic coefficient of 41.9 per cent. If the omissions are 

 supplied, Hall estimates that there would he not less than 1200 

 species in the park area of 1124 square miles. 



The .selection of regions of greater physiograi)hic diversity, than 

 those which we have discussed, brings out some interesting facts. 

 It shows that our study is a comparative one, as we have contrasted 

 areas such as Point Pelee and the Florida Keys with regions of 

 somewhat greater diversity, such as Jackson County, Missouri and 

 the Yosemite National Park, California. A greater contra.st is .seen 

 when we compare the Yosemite region of consideral)le diversifica- 

 tion of topography with regions of even greater natural environ- 

 mental conditions. 



The flora of the State of Connecticut,'- which has a great variety 

 of soils, slope exposures, river .systems and tidal estuaries, includes 

 621 genera and 1942 species, so that the generic coefficient is 31.9 

 per cent. As a close approximation to this coefficient yielded hy a 

 flora at al)OUt the same latitude and not far removed geographically, 

 we have the flora of the vicinity of New York. In his monograph, 

 Taylf)r'' lists 830 genera and 2051 specit's of plants. The physi- 

 ograj)liy of the New Y(jrk region includes salt marshes, estuaries, 

 sea bi'achts, large river systems, mountains, as the Catskills and 

 the Poconos, sandy CDuntry, as the [)ine-l)arrens of New .Jersey, and 

 morainic deposits in Long Island and elsewhere. Hence we find 

 the percentage 31.3 per cent, to Ix- an expression of that diversity. 



Tin; flora of a great state like Pennsylvania." with all kinds of 

 soils, river system^, lakes, hogs, mountain systems and plateaus, 

 might he expected to gi\-e a low generic coefficient. aii<l we find on 

 counting tliat there are (iSO genera and 227o species of ferns and 

 seed i)lants, so that the coefficient is 2!>..S per cent. 



Consulting the Floni of Tennessee, hy (lattinger. puhlislu-d in 

 1901, we find that for that state, with a high and ancient system of 

 mountains in its eastern end, that there are 7')') genera and 2218 

 species of plants, a consi<lerahle nuinher less than in Pennsylvania, 

 and that the generic coefficient of the Tennessee flora i> 31 per cent.

 822 genera ami 2502 species, yielding a generic coefficient of 1^2.8 

 per cent. 



However, if wo use Coulter and Nelson's \ew Manual of Bolanij 

 of the Cenfral Rocky Mountdins (1909), we find that 2.'i.7 per 

 cent, is the generic coef!ici<'nt for that region where the diversity of 

 land conHgviration is great and where the ecologic conditions jin^sent 

 striking ditT(>rences. There are listed in this manual 049 genera 

 and 2733 species. 



The differences presented by the generic coefficients of different 

 countries is illustrated l)y reference to the Flora of the State of 

 Washington, by Charles V. Piper (1900), and by an . enumeration 

 of the genera and species given in Jepson's Flora of Western Middle 

 California (1901). The first work gives 014 genera antl 2279 species, 

 as the richness of the Washington flora, while Jepson's book includes 

 421 genera and 1449 species. The generic coefficient for the flora 

 of Washington was determined to l)e 20.9 per cent, and for that of 

 western middle California 29 per cent. 



In such regions as the Appalachian ^Mountains, which represent 

 an ancient upheaval, and are covered with a deciduous forest, which 

 has occupied the region since the Miocene, the chronologic factor 

 must be considered as one of the factors influencing the numerical 

 richness of the flora. This fact is al.so illustrated in California, 

 where the diversity of the coast flora in endemic types, as contrasted 

 with that of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, is linked intimately with 

 the past geologic hi.story of the country. Although possessing many 

 species in conlmon, the flora of the coast ranges of California is 

 decidedly different from that of the Sierra Nevada. Jepson regards 

 the flora of the California coast ranges as a decidedly endemic one, 

 much older and more unique than that of the Sierra Nevada. An 

 examination of a list of plants peculiar to the coast ranges and 

 the Sierra Nevada will show that the coast ranges lack tho-;e northern 

 genera which we may call boreal-alpine, while the list of genera 

 found in the Sierra Nevada includes such boreal-alpine genera as 

 Bryanthus, Cassiope, Sibbaldia. This difference at once emphasizes 

 the fact, that to explain the floral diversity and the generic coefficient, 

 we mu.st emphasize not only present conditions of physiography 

 a.s effective, but we mu.st study the geologic hi.story of the region as 

 well, as the past distribution and past successional phases of the 

 land and water plants. 



Before summarizing, it is important to give a few additional

comparative figures. Small includes in his Flora of the South- 

 eastern United States (1913), 6364 species and 1494 ^fnera, giving 

 a generic coefficient of 23 per cent. The total number of genera 

 and species in Gray's Manual^^ is 821 genera and 3413 species, or 

 24 per cent., for the British flora 734 genera and 2964 species, or 

 24 per cent., and for .Switzerland 659 genera and 2453 -species, or 

 27 per cent. 



If we place in sequence the numbers which we have given aljove. 

 it becomes evident that we can arrange our regions so that we dis- 

 cover that no two places are alike with respect to the diversity of 

 the physiographic conditions.

The figures of this tal)le are a partial confirmation of Jaccard's 

 law of plant distribution, applied for the first time to a statistic 

 study of the American flora. It seems, therefore, "that the generic 

 coefficient is inversely proportional to the diversity of ecologic 

 conditions." Such regions a.s the central, northeastern and south- 

 eastern United States, central Rocky Mountains, (Ireat Britain, 

 and Switzerland have ecologic conditions of the greatest diversity, 

 and hence low generic crM-fficients, while the Pelee region, the Miami 

 region and that of tin- Fhjrida Keys with fairly uniform physiography 

 have relatively high generic coefficients. t

AN ARRANGEMENT OF MINERALS ACCORDING TO THEIR OCCURRENCE.' 

 BY EDGAR T. WHEKUY AND SAMUEL G. GORDON. 



In till' preparation of a catalog of the minerals of Pennsylvania, 

 upon which the writers have been engaged for some time, a system- 

 atic plan for listing the minerals under each locality has proved 

 desiral)le. The standard classification, as used by Dana, being unsatis- 

 factory for this purpose, in that it is based on chemico-crystallographic 

 features, and represents a laboratory rather than a field system, 

 a new arrangement, based on occurrence and genetic relationships, 

 has been worked out. 



The principles applied recjuire little discussion. The types of 

 mineral occurrence are classified on the basis of chemical and geo- 

 logical relations, the chief criterion for subdivision being dissimilarity 

 in mineral content. Thus, granite is not separated from syenite, 

 since both are made up of essentially the same minerals; but low- 

 alkali syenites are separated from those high in alkalies because 

 ([uite different minerals develop in the two. The various sub- 

 divisions are not sharply defined, but grade i?ito one another, so 

 that rather arbitrary lines must be drawn between them; for example, 

 certain types of veins, such as the tourmaliniferous copper veins, 

 might with equal right be classed with either pneumatolytic veins 

 or hydrot hernial deposits, and their minerals are here arbitrarily 

 placed in the former class. However, every effort has been made 

 to minimize difficulties of this sort by making the subdivisions as 

 comprehensive as possible. In arranging the minerals in each 

 division, Dana's order has V)een more or less closely followed. 



Kather than coin new names for the several subdivisions of this 

 scheme of cla.s.sification, we have employed terms in common use, 

 even though they are not altogether appropriate. Thus "hydro- 

 thermal" is u.sed for mineral veins, as is cu.stomary with economic 

 geologists, although it is recognized that pegmatites and, for that 

 matter, even igneous rocks, have about as much right to this term, 

 since both water and heat contribute to their formation. The terms 

 silicic, alkalic, calcic, and magne.sic for the chemical subdivisions are 

 intended to indicate only the prominence of the respective con-

 Academy, December 14, 1014.

stituents, and not to have a strict quantitative significance, g,lthough 

 in general the "silicic" rocks contain more than 45% SiOo, while 

 in the other three over 7.5% of the oxides to which the name of 

 each refers is usually present. 



The classification has been extended to about 800 mineral species, 

 some rare minerals being necessarily omitted because of lack of 

 information as to their occurrence, although it is to be expected that 

 many additions to the lists will prove necessary as our knowledge of 

 mineral associations advances. 



Much (^f the data has been obtained from recent works, especially 

 those of Lindgren,- Kimuons,'' and Rogers.^

new or little-known crane-flies from the united states and 

 canada; tipulidje, diptera. part 2. 



by charles p. alexander. 



Introduction. 



In the present paper, the author has undertaken a consideration 

 of the American crane-tties contained in the collections of the Boston 

 Society of Natural History and the Museum of Comparative Zoology 

 at Cambridge. These collections are of peculiar interest to the 

 student of crane-flies since they include the numerous types of 

 Johnson, Osten Sacken, and Loew, in addition to a considerable 

 amount of unclassified material. The paper has been divided into 

 two parts, the first being a designation of the single-type specimen 

 of the species of Tipula described by Loew, the second part a con- 

 tinuation of the first paper under this title.^ I wish to express my 

 deep appreciation to all of the persons who have kindly assisted me 

 in this study, most of whom are designated in various parts of the 

 paper. I am especially indebted to Mr. Charles W. Johnson and 

 to Mr. Samuel Henshaw for the great privilege of examining and 

 studying the invaluable collections in their custody. 



Part 1. Designation of the Single-type (Lectotypic) Specimen 



OF the North American Species of Tipula described 



by Hermann Loew. 



The North American crane-flies described by Hermann Loew 

 were included in a series of papers published between the years 

 1861 and 1872 under the general title of Diptera Americce septen- 

 trionalis indigenoe and appearing in the Berliner Entomologische 

 Zeitschrift. This remarkable series of articles was in ten parts or 

 centuries, each containing the description of a hundred species of 

 flies. The references will l^e merely to the "Century," with the 

 number of the species in the century and the original pagination. 

 The date of the five centuries in which the crane-flies were described 

 is as follows:

 Century VIII, vol. 13, Xo. 2; 1869. 

 Centur>' X, vol. 16, Xos. 2, 3; 1872. 



All of the Xorth American crane-flies described by Loew in this 

 series of articles belong to the subfamily Tipidince and include the 

 following genera: Ctenophora (1 species); Longurio (1 .species); 

 Holantsia (I species); Stygeropsis (3 species); Pachyrrhina (19 

 species j and Tipuln (41 species). The Loew material is all cotypic, 

 there being no designation of a single-type specimen, and conse- 

 quently the choosing of a lectotype at this time is deemed advisable. 

 Concerning the Loew collection, as it is now preserved, it should be 

 understood that the type-series for anj' species very often includes 

 many specimens that were not mentioned by Loew in his original 

 description, and yet there can be no doubt but that the material 

 formed part of the type-series, since the specimens often bear the 

 written label in Loew's script and the text of certain of the descrip- 

 tions indicates that this material was before the author at the time 

 tliat the description was drawn up. It has often seemed advisable 

 to select one of these latter specimens as type, but tliis has not been 

 don<^ unless the actual specimen mentioned by Loew could not be 

 located, as in the case of Tipnla (uujulala. In all cases the male sex 

 has been given preference over the female Ijecause of the varied 

 characters of the hyiiopygium of this sex. Specimens that were 

 j)laced in the series by Osten Sacken at the time that he arranged 

 tlie material in the mu.seum, but from the jjlace and date were 

 obviously not in Loew's hands at the time of the drawing u|) of tin* 

 flescriptions, have been ignored. It may be stated that the material 

 in the Mu.seum of Comparative Zoology, as regards the species of 

 7'ipiilii, is still largely unarrangcfl except to the major divisions 

 l)ase(l on the wing-pattern, there being thre(! large cases d(;voted 

 to the strinUr, marmoraUv and siihtinicolorrs. When one studies the 

 descriptions of the Tipuhr described by Loew it is at once noted tliat 

 only about six of the forty or more characterized are of tin; siih- 

 rmirolorcs, and this was explained when the collection was studied. 

 The majority of the species described as new in the |)reseiit ]iaper, 

 as well as most of the ICastern species named by Doane in VM)l, were 

 found in the collection, bearing manuscript names in Ix)ew's writing 

 l)Ut for some unexplained reason having never been described. In 

 (•,i<c< ulirre tlii> was fc.a.sible the iiMliie sugirested li\' I.ocw i< the

one that ha^ been adopted. These manuscript names of Loew 

 have appeared in various collections, or, in some cases {bicornis, 

 breincoUis), even into the literature, and consequentlj' it is deemed 

 advisable to mention the name apj^lied by I^oew to the different 

 species discussed in the second jnirt of this paper.

The type-material was stated to have come from Massachusetts, 

 but the only specimen now appearing in the collection is a male 

 from New Hampshire, bearing the number 258, with the name-label 

 in Loew's writing. It is this si^ecimen that is designated as the type; 

 there is a possibility that th(» locality labels were later confused or 

 that Loew wrote down the wrong State in his original description. 

 There is no reason whatsoever for doubting that the specimen was 

 before Loew at the time he drew up the description. The paler 

 specimen mentioned in a note by Loew is not of this species, but of 

 T. pcmobscot, described later; the sex is not female, but male.

The genus Xephrotoma was erected by Meigen in 1803 to include 

 the Fabrician species, dormlit<. The insect mentioned, specimens 

 of which are before me (Urdingcn, Niedcrrhein. Clermany; Riedel, 

 collector), is a typical Pachijrrhinn of the same group as eucera Loew 

 (Nearctic). The venational details and the characters of the male 

 hypopygium are altogether of the nature of those occurring in Pachyr- 

 rhinn. Loew. in a fo(jt-note to the characterization of cucern (Ber- 

 liner Entomoloyi.sche Zeiiichrift, VII, Century 4, p. 297; 1803) states 

 that if Xephrotoma is to l)e separate*! from Poclufrrhina, eucera 

 should be refern-d to Scphrotoma. 'i'he antemup (jf eucera and dorsali.s 

 are 19-segmente(l in the male; of pobjimra, Hi-.segmented in the 

 male; of the majority of the species of the gentis. 13-segmented in 

 the male. Thus we see there is a very considerable range in the 

 numl)er of antemial .segments, but the s|)ecie>^ included are'all so 

 very similar in tin- details of venation, in the male hy|)opygia and in 

 their general lial>itus and body-coloration that they should not be 

 separated, especially since the females show a ver}' much lesser 

 range in the number of antennal segments ( 13 to 15). A considerable 




4(30 rHOCEKDINtiS OF TIIK AfADEMV OF [^^'pt., 



variation in tlic nunil)er of antennal sop;nionts is found in other 

 genera of crane-fiies (Ctedonia, 15 to 24 scfinicnts ; Ccrozoflia, 32 to 

 39 segments; Tanjtflcnis, 17 to 25 segments), and consequently too 

 much significance should not be placed upon this variahle character 

 in these groujis. 



The genus Pachi/rrhina was descril)ed at a much later date, and 

 consequently the numerous species known throughout the world 

 under this name nuist be referred to Xephrotoma. The change in 

 the American species affects all of the described forms with the excep- 

 tion of collar is Say, polymera Loew, nobilis Loew, unimaculata Loew, 

 calif ornica Donne, trinicladensis A\cxa.nder and macroderna Alexander, 

 which should l)e referred to the genus Tipida as discussed below. 



The discovery of an ultimate character to separate the species of 

 Xephrotoma from those of Tipida is still largely a desideratum. 

 There are a number of characters which, if used in combination, 

 should serve to separate the species of the two genera. The majority 

 of the characters cited below should hold in all cases. \'enationally 

 these characters are as follows: 



(1) The very short, usually almost transverse, radial sector of 

 Xephrotofna, which in many species is transverse and simulates a 

 cross-vein; in other species longer and more oblique, reaching its 

 maximum length apparently in species such as vittida Loew. 



(2) The sessile cell Mi in Xephrotoma, this l)eing rarely short- 

 petiolate. This character has long been known, having been clearly 

 stated Ijy Schiner (1864). Species of Tipida with the cell ses.sile 

 are unknown. 



(3) The basal deflection of Ciii and the cross-vein m-cu at or 

 before the fork of M. This character, described for the first time by 

 Czizek- and independently by Brunetti,^ is the nearest approach 

 to absolute of any that we have, but even this is approached by 

 some species of Tipida (the marmoratee group, fragilis Loew, ignobilis 

 Loew, et al.). 



The male hypopygium of Xephrotoma shows the ninth pleurite 

 never completely fused with the ninth sternite, the more generalized 

 condition occurring in .such species as incurva Loew, where the 

 pleurite is almo.st entirely separatefl from the sternite, through 

 lugens Loew, where the pleural suture is .straight and not curved 

 dorsally toward the tip, to the more speciahzed condition with the

1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 407 



curved suture obtaining in many .-species (eucera Loew, fcmiginea 

 Fabricius, peduncidata Loew, et ah). The ninth tergite is usually 

 small and rather inconspicuous, not tumid. The outer pleural 

 appendage is fleshy, in the shape of a more or less flattened lobe, 

 which is sometimes attenuated or arcuated. 



In general, the .species of Xephrotoma are shiny with well-marked 

 stripes and bright colors. In some, however (as macroccra .Sayj, 

 the colors are dull, quite as in some species of Tipula. The six 

 species listed before, as well as the new species described below as 

 Tipula pachyrhinoides, which have hitherto been taken to Ik* species 

 of Xephrotoma, agree with the species of this latter genus only in 

 the bright, shiny coloration, all of the other characters pointing 

 strongly to the fact that thej' are really .^species of Tipida. The 

 second Tipida californica described by Doane'' thus reciuires renaming. 



In the work by Czizek cited Ijefore.^ the author of this excellent 

 paper has given a critical comparison of Xephrotofna and Pachijrrliina, 

 pointing out the fact that there is no basis at all for retaining the 

 latter name; but in spite of this clear comparison, the two names 

 are .still kept separate. The "dincoidal cross-vein" spoken of by the 

 author is that portion of the vein M between the cross-vein in-cu 

 and the fork oi M.

The type of this beautiful fly was taken on the shaded eiistern 

 slopes of Buell Mt., one of the southern peaks of the Adirondacks. 

 It occurred in the hardwood forest which clothes the mountain, in 

 the neighborhood of small granitic cliffs and near the dricd-up bed 

 of a mountain torrent. Crane-flies which were flying \\ith this 

 species included Limnobia cinctipes, L. indigcna, Limnophila munda,

Perha|)s the most striking result of the study ot .Xintiica/i eraiic- 

 flics during the past few years has been the discovery that the Tipula 

 speciosn Loew is the male sex of fuliginoan Say. The evidence that 

 this is the case has been slow in accumulating, but is ik)w so eon- 




480 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACAUKMV OK [^I'l^t-, 



elusive that the eoniHtion can be stated definitely at this time. 

 The males (specioso) are very light coloreil. yellowish; the females 

 (fulifp'nosn) are dark brownish to almost black. This is the first case 

 of dimorphism in the TipulitUe that has come to my notic(\ but the 

 related species, jejuna Johnson and hiuglKinnock sp. n., certainly 

 belong here. 



This evidence of dimori)hism in the species that is before me is as 

 follows: a male and a female, taken in copulation, collected at Ira, 

 Sunnnit Co., Ohio, by James S. Hine. A male and a female secured 

 in copulation and actually pinned while still "in coitu," collected 

 at light, Boston, Mass., June 1. 1914, by II. M. Parshley. The 

 final evidence is the finding of two crane-Hy i)upa^ in the debris 

 beneath the nest of a turkey vulture, on Jacksons Island, Md., 

 May 23, 1913, by Messrs. Barl)er and Shannon. The material 

 was taken to the laboratory, and both spwimens emerged on May 23, 

 1913, one a male speciosa, the other a hnniilv fuliciinosd ! 



On June 13, 1914, on Buell Mt., Fulton Co., N. Y., the males of 



this fly were common on the mountain side in the open shady woods. 



One female was taken. The males were usually found flying up a 



tree-trunk, beginning low down near the base of the tree, ascending 



by a partly flying, partly climbing motion. They were undoubtedly 



searching for the retiring females, as has been observed in other 



woodland-inhabiting species, as fragilis and others.

The insect was common on June 5, 1913, in a avoocIv tract along 

 the Stillwater Bayou, Orono, ^Je., where it occurred with Dicmnomyia 

 liberta, Erioptera calopfera, E. armata, and Tipida bella. 



The fly was reared from a large aquatic larva found in the Indian 

 Spring near Ithaca, Cayuga Lake, N. Y., where it occurred in the 

 l)eds of water-cress (Radiciila nasiurtium-aquaticum) in company of 

 other Tipulid larvse, such as Pedicia albovitta, Limnophila quadmta, 

 Tipida abdominalis and T. bella, as well as a host of the usual aquatic 

 organisms. Other larvse of this species, likewise strictly aquatic, 

 were found in Coy Glen, Ithaca. X. Y., a rapid-flowing gorge stream.

There can be no doubt but that the three names given above 

 represent one and the same species. Under the series of cundans 

 determined as such by Loew, there appears a specimen which bears 

 a manuscript label in Loew's writing ami this label is '' infuscata." 

 The type-series of casta and infuscata, as well as the series of cundans^ 

 all bear the same manuscript number given to the specimens by 

 Osten Sacken (Xo. 95). In the series of Tipida cundans there are 

 two females dated October 20; it is well known that infuscata is one 

 of the few autumnal species of Nearctic Tipula, and this data in 

 regard to cundans only confirms the synonomy of the species. 



The Bicornts Group. 



The small group of species that constitute this division seem to 

 show the following characters and tendencies: The nasus is very 

 short to indistinct; the coloration is yellow or bro\vnish yellow 

 with the thoracic stripes usually distinct; the body is provided with 

 abundant short hairs on the head and on the thoracic interspaces. 

 The venation shows the cell 1st Mi very small and pentagonal (larger 

 and more elongated in johnsoniana) . The male hypopygium has 

 the ninth tergite tumid (very slightly so in parshleyi), unarmed or 

 provided with horns (unarmed in johnsoniana; two horns in bicornis 

 and morrisoni; four horns in megaura); the ninth pleurite com- 

 plete; the outer pleural appendage tending to be reduced to a 

 very tinj' lobe; the inner pleural appendage large, elongate to 

 subquadrate; the gonapophyses subtending the penis-guard, and 

 about half its length (in morrisoni, megawa, etc.) to fully the length 

 of the penis-guard (in johnsoniana) . The female ovipositor with the 

 valves short, blunt and subfle.shy, little chitinized. Our species 

 may be separated in the male sex by the following key : 



1. Ninth tergite not tumid; eighth sternite very long, sheathing the- 

 ninth .sternite beneath, the tip with two chitinized points on 

 each .side parshleyi sp. n.

The PaliParctic Tipiihi fascipennis Meigen (1818) was the first 

 described species of this group and should probablj' give the name 

 to the group. The Nearctic groups of the genus should be correlated 

 with the Pakearctic species.

FISHES FROM EASTERN CANADA. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Within the past few years the Academy has received several 

 collections from different localities in the eastern and maritime 

 provinces of the Dominion. They have been submitted to me for 

 study, anfl as several interesting or new records were found among 

 thom, this paper is offered as a slight contribution to science. 

 Acknowledfrnient is here expressed to those who made the collec- 

 tions, and also for such field notes as are appended. 



Lake Cassette. 



'J'his is one of the Rimouski series of lakes in Rimouski County, 

 Province of (Quebec. Another connected lake is Long Lake, in the 

 same region. From these waters a numl)er of fresh chars were 

 obtained l)y Mr. J. E. V. Titus, in Septemi)er of l!ll 1 and 1!»12. 

 Balvelinus fontinalis (MiKliill;. 



Two rather well-marked varieties occur, which were tliougiit to 

 be distinct by the fishermen, distinguished locally as the "brook 

 trout" anfl the "gray back." 



The first of these is of variable color, from very dark In (juite 

 light or tan, or even pale brown. Dark examples are (juite 

 olivaceous. Hvd on lower sides ordinarily of dee|) crimson. In 

 weight they range from one-half to six pounds and four ounces. 

 They are said to spawn in late October, or fmni late Septeiiil)er till 

 late r)etober. In 'J'ouradiff Lake examples occur all (piite i)lack on 

 the back, in fact dusky-olive, and with the red of Ihi- lower sides 

 swarthy.- Possibly this is due to the numerous submergecl conifers, 

 besides other liinber in tli<' lake, which renders the water ;ind the 

 fish dark. 



The gray-back is distinguishe<l by the allege(l variety of its steel- 

 gray color, the blotches and markings appearing very distinct. It 

 <|(jes not show red on its lower sides. 'IMie old females are known 

 as " bull-dogs, " on account of their snul)-noses. It reaches^i length 

 of eight tf) eighteen inches, a weight of al>out three and one-half 

 poimds, and spawn-^ later than the ordinary trout, or in October 

 and November.

 of right side usually 8, seldom 9 + 12, rarely 13; total length 12| 

 to 141 inches, of seven examples. 



Color when fresh, back deep olive to dusky .'the latter shade mostly 

 over median line and color becoming more rich olive as it descends 

 the sides. Sides, in region of lateral line, marked bj'' well-spaced 

 small red spots ocellated with very pale l)lue, though these last only 

 present when fish is taken from the water. Head dusky to olive 

 above, sides same, and lower surface whitish, with smutty tinge over 

 branchiostegals. Iris brownish or dusky, with narrow circle of 

 golden about dark pupil. Inside gill-openings pale. Dorsal and 

 caudal dusky-olive, with dusky shades on membranes of former. 

 Pectoral with whitish upper edge, on outer surface grayish medianly 

 aljove and lower surface orange-red, and on inner surface dark upper 

 median tint dusky-olive. Ventral orange-red, front and hind edges 

 whitish. Anal with front edge whitish, broad distal edge pale 

 orange and base pale dusky. Breast, belly, abdomen, and most all 

 of ventral region orange-red, though much paler posteriorly. 



When first studied I was inclined to consider these specimens as 

 a new form of char allied to the Salmo marstoni Garman. The ix)ints 

 of difference according to the original description are the very small 

 scales, about 230 in the series immediately al)Ove the lateral line, 

 and more than 250 in a row 5 or G scales above this. The eye is 

 given as less than 5 in the head, the maxillary extending backward 

 almost as far as hinder edge of eye, and the gill-rakers 8 -f 14. 

 From the above it is therefore quite likely these characters are really 

 individual variations. The spots of red along the lateral line are 

 imperfectly made out and their colors not sufficiently detailed in 

 the original description of Salmo marstoni Garman.^ Under the

 li.sted as Salvelinus marstoni, Evermann and Goldsborough give- 

 a list of localities for the Quel)ec and Ottawa provinces, including 

 Lake Cassette among their records. 



According to Mr. Titu.s, the present form is kno\ATi as the "Golden 

 trout" or ''Poisson d'Oro," from its coloration. The males always 

 exhibit orange-red sides and the female appears to have a more 

 yellowish tinge. The largest examples were about Ih pounds in 

 weight, and the dimensions of the largest noted al)Ove. They 

 spawn in late Xovemljcr and during December, in this locality. 

 All the trout of these lakes were spaA\Tiing on the same grounds. 

 They do not appear to be common, and are taken in jiroportion of 

 one to every 150 or 200 brook trout.

THE FISHES OF TRINIDAD. GRENADA. AND ST. LUCIA, BRITISH 

 WEST INDIES. 



PY IIFARY W. FOWLEH. 



In February and March of 1915 ]\Ir. Richard M. Abbott vi.sitcd 

 variou.s of the Lesser Antilles, and while at the above-named islands 

 made several collpctions of fishes. Through his gonerosit^y, these 

 have all been received as gifts to the museum of the Academy. 



Trinidad. 



The collection from this island is the mo.st extensive. It was 

 made chiefly in the fish-market of Port-of-Spain, from February 27 

 to March 7. The market fishes are all taken in the Gulf of Paria, 

 brought to to^^^l, and there disposed of as food. The waters of the 

 Gulf of Paria are continually discolored, so that they have a muddy 

 color. This has been explained as due to the va.st quantities of 

 river deposits, silt, etc., carried down the Orinoco and through its 

 delta out into the sea. The shore currents then carry the soiled 

 and less saline waters north into the more or less enclosed gulf, 

 where they apparent h' are unable to clear. Apparently continuously 

 muddied, the water supports a rich fish-fauna. A few of the larger 

 species were seen in the market, and though carefully noted, were 

 not preserved. They are included below with this reservation. 



No account of the marine fishes of Trinidad has ever appeared. 

 The records of the few species known from the island occur princi- 

 pallj' as scattered references to material in the ]3riti.sh Mu.seum. 

 The.se will be found in the catalogues by the late Dr. Albert Giinther,^ 

 and in the second edition by Dr. G. A. Boulenger.^ Dr. Giinther 

 also described several cyprinodonts in ISOS,"^ and about the same 

 time Hill has some notes. ^ More recently Dr. Barton A. Bean 

 described a flounder from Port-of-Spain.'' 



The first work on the fresh-water fishes was contributed by the 

 late Dr. Theodore Gill in 1858.^ Subsequently it was the subject

of critical notes by the late Dr. Liitken.^ Recently a very interesting 

 and valuable account appeared by Dr. C. Tate-Regan, based chiefly 

 on the collection, notes, and sketches of Mr. Lechmere Guppy, Jr.^ 



In the present paper a list of all the fishes now kno^^•n from the 

 island is given. Where species are represented in the collections of 

 the Academy, they are mentioned with the number of specimens 

 and their dimensions. The references pertain to the few species 

 previously known from Trinidad. While likely most of tiie fresh- 

 water species have been discovered, further collecting of the marine 

 forms will undoubtedlj' yield many others. Possibly seven or more 

 times as many as here listed, if not most of those comprising the 

 vast West Indian fauna, will eventually be found.

Only the type known. This .species is allietl with Anchovia mitchilU, 

 but (Hffers in its larger size, more protruding .snout, narrower lateral 

 baml, much longer pectoral, and dark hind caudal edge. A. astilbc 

 (Jordan and Rutter),'^ A. robcrti^i (Jordan and Kutter),'^ and .4. 

 januarius (Steindachner),^^ all have much shorter anal.^. A. 

 nallereri (Steindachner)'^ has a more slender boch', smaller eye, and 

 shorter maxillary. A. olklus (Giinther)^^ has a longer dorsal and 

 more posterior anal.

 The fins are bright yellow. 



Oligoplites saliens (Bloch). 



One, 11 inches long. This is quite distinct from tiie preceding, 

 though some writers have suggested they may be identical. 0. 

 saliens has a different physiognomy, less attenuate or with the 

 profile of the lower jaw much more convex. The snout about equals 

 the eye, or longer, in the preceding species, whereas in the present 

 it is a little shorter than the eye. The maxillary extends further 

 back or a little behind the hind eye edge, the suborbital though 

 broad covers less of the cheek, and the anal is inserted distinctly 

 before the .soft dorsal, w^hile in 0. saurus it is inserted opposite. 

 Dorsal and caudal largely edged with dusky. My example agrees 

 in all respects with an example from Rio Janeiro.

 edge. Iris dark reddish. Edges of dorsal, caudal and anal very 

 narrowly whitish, submarginal region blackish. One example of 

 inches long. 



This species is acknowledged to be distinct from R. saponaceus on 

 account of its larger eye, longer than snout. As I have no cor- 

 responding small examples of K. saponaceus, these points cannot be 

 verified. Boulenger says the .snout and eye are ec}ual in /?. arenatus, 

 though in my example the eye is distinctly larger. Jordan and Kutter 

 have mentioned several examples from Jamaica,'^ and state "one has 

 three opercular spines" and "aside from the number of opercular 

 spines, this species may be distinguished from the preceding Ijy its 

 more slender bodj'^, depth 1^ to 1^ in head, and by the less projecting 

 lower jaw. " Now the type of Eleulheradis coriaceus Cope shows the 

 depth greater than the length of the head, and the i)reopercular spines 

 2 on the left side (lower bifid) of the head and 3 on the right side. 

 Th(! opercular spines are three on both sides, and both upper and

RAFINESQUE'S TYPES OF UNIO. 

 BY E. G. VANATTA. 



Mr. C. A. PouLson, in -1 Monograph of the Fluviaiile Bivalves of 

 the Okie River, Translated from the French of Prof. C. S. Rafinesque, 

 Philadelphia (1832), p. v, states that he has "most of the shells 

 described" by Prof. Rafine.sque in the Monographie des Coguilles 

 Bivalves Fluviatiles de la Riviere Ohio} These shells are now in the 

 collection of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, with 

 Rafine.sque's original labels and ink numbers on the specimens. These 

 numbers are the same as those in Prof. Rafinesque's Monograph 

 of 1820. 



The fractions given V)y Rafinesque after each species indicate at 

 what point upon the shell a given dimension is found. The figured 

 species agree well \\\Xh the t>'pes or specimens in hand. 



As some of Rafinesque's names are now in use, I believe it will 

 be of interest to determine l)y what names these shells an- known 

 at the present time and the effect on nomenclature if they were 

 recognized and the names dated from 1820. 



Many of Rafine.sque's species have been credited to Conrail by 

 Mr. C T. Simpson. 2 



Dr. H. A. Pilsl^ry, to whom this paper has been submitted, sug- 

 gests that it should be explicitly stated that the use of a Rafinesquian 

 name depends upon whether, it could be identified by descriptions 

 I)ublished i)rior U) any other recognizable name for the same species. 

 That it can be recognized from the types or other specimens from 

 Rafinesfjue does not entitle his names to acceptance unless the 

 l)ublished descriptions are ade(juate. This (juestion of the ade<|uacy 

 of published diagnoses must be considered for each s])ecies separately. 

 It is not taken up in this paj^er, which deals merely with the (piestion 

 of the identity of the Rafines(jue-Poulson .specimens.

THE STRUCTURAL RELATIONS OF SOME DEVONIAN SHALES IN CENTRAL 



NEW YORK. 



BY HU'tNETT SMITH. 



The shale ma.s«< which intervene.^ l)etween the Onondaga and 

 Tully limestone;? of central New York was fornierlj' separated into 

 a lower division of Marcellus shales and an upper division of Hamilton 

 shales. It is now jiretty generally conci'ded that this classification 

 is inadequate to expre.ss the facts and the geologists of the State of 

 New York now employ Marcellus shale, Cardiff shale, Skaneateles 

 shale, Ludlowvillc shale, and Moscow shale in dcscrihing the strati- 

 graphic units encountered in passing upward from the Onondaga 

 to the Tully. These shale units hv inference correspond with 

 definite subdivisions of the Devonian time scale. They are also 

 regarded as po.ssessing a rather wide east and west distribution 

 across the State.' Recent field studies in Onondaga and Cayuga 

 Counties have convinced the writer that the lower members of the 

 shale mass have a far from simple history. Followed in an east 

 and west line they present changes which remain unrecognized even 

 in the recent classifications. These notes are therefore submitted 

 as a partial record ami preliminary interpretation of the observations 

 made. 



A brief survey of the general stratigrapliN' brings out the fact 

 that the shales have been deposited upon ()nonilaga limestone. 

 In some places the line between the ( )nondagM and the succeeding 

 black shale is (piite sharp, but at others there is a transition zone of 

 lime.stone an<l black >liale alternations in thin bands. (Ireat varia- 

 tions in the amount of limestone intercalation ure noticed in the 

 10 or 1.') feet just above the Onondaga. One limestone stratum, 

 however, is >liown in all good exposures. 'll\'\> la>er known a.s the 

 .\goniatites limestoiH- is about '.i feet in thicknes> and holds a position 

 approximately 10 or b"> feet above strata which are referable to the 

 Onondaga. Lying thu^ u|»on bl:iek >hale or upon l)lack shale an<l 

 limestone alternati(»n> the .\goniatites limestone is in turn followed 

 i>y a de|)osit of dense black shale in which concretions of large size 

 are apt to be a very conspi<-uous feature. Thi- higher l)lack shale

is now grouped with tin- otlici- hiycrs down to the ( )non(laj>;:i under 

 one formational term. Mureellus.'- 



As used by Vanuxem.Mhe term Marcellus apparently embraced 

 a still higher shale of gray color. This latter was given a separate 

 mime by Clarke ami Luther who in 1<)()4 called it the Cardiff shale.-* 

 In the type region (on the Tully quadrangle) the change from the 

 Marcellus is most gradual while above the Cardiff is defined as 

 terminating some 20 feet below a thin band of limestone.^ This 

 limestone is grouped with the 20 feet of shale below and some hun- 

 tlreds of feet above under a single formational term, Skaneateles. 



These general stratigraphic relations appear to hold good for 

 central Onondaga County, but on tracing the formations westward 

 deviations from the type section are noticed. It is now proposed 

 to present the evidence for these deviations. 



Just south of Mottville. on the Skaneateles quadrangle, occurs 

 a fossiliferous zone which is well disj)layed along the outlet of Skane- 

 ateles Lake. The section at this ]>oint shows a thickness of about 

 25 feet. In the lower part the shale is gray and thinly bedded 

 with small fossils numerous. Above come small concretions and 

 a limy l)and full of crinoid fragments. This latter is in turn overlaid 

 by a rather coarse and thickly bedded shale, also quite fossiliferous.^ 

 These strata are not here exposed in continuous section with any 

 ea.sily recognized reference plane. It was with the intention of 

 a.scertaining their position in the shale mass that the writer under- 

 took to follow these l)eds east and west from the Mottville locality. 



For the sake of simplicity^ the term Mottville member will be 

 used as a provisional designation for the limy clmoidal band and

 Third District, p. l.")4. Speaking of Cayuga Lake, he says: "The first rock 

 Eoing .south on the lake, after passing the low elayey groimd to the south of 

 Springport, may be considered as the dividing line between the Mareellus shales 

 anrl the Hamilton group. It is a dark slaty fossiliferous shale, with numerous 

 in<lividuals of the Orthis umbonata of Mr. Conrad, but usually small, a.ssociated 

 with the Limitary orthis (O. limitaris) also numerous, ete. It shows about 

 .six feet of a brownish blaek impure limestone. This i)art forms the small rise 

 about half a mile or more below Levana. It appears in the road from SpringjKirt 

 to Levana, at Cri.se's brook; on the road to Auburn from Sj^ringport, two miles 

 .southwest of Half-acre; to the northeast of Skaneateles on the road to Marcellus, 

 and on the north side of Pompey hill, ete." 



Though this description makes no mention of tlie Mottville locality, it shows 

 quite clearly that its author was famili.-ir with many of the other good exposures 

 of these .strata.

as.sociated fos.siliferou.s shales above ami below which are exposed 

 along the Skaneateles outlet south of Mottville.^ This member 

 can be readily reoognizetl by its lithologie and jialeontologic char- 

 acters for a few miles east and west from the type section. Eastward 

 there is some slight change in its features, but the horizon can be 

 traced with little difficulty onto the TuUy quadrangle where the 

 writer considers it to be identical with the basal layers oi the Skane- 

 ateles formation up to and slightly above the limestone band already 

 mentioned.^ 



The presence of a thin fossiliferous zone l)etween masses of rela- 

 tively barren shale is usually regarded as a matter of some paleon- 

 tologic interest and the Mottville is no exception in this respect. 

 It was not, however, imtil the writer studied the relations of this 

 member to underlying formations westwartl that he realized the 

 important position which the Mottville holds in any attempt to 

 solve the stratigraphy of the lower shale units. 



Its authors recognized that the Cardiff shale thins toward the 

 west, a statement to that effect appearing in their description of the 

 type sections." 



Nevertheless, the writer confes.ses that he was inucli surprised to 

 learn in the fi<'ld that the gra}' shah^s between the harder limy por- 

 tions of the Mottville and the black Marcellus thin down to about 

 100 feet southeast of the village of Marcellus (Skaneateles (luad- 

 rangle), to about 50 feet in the belt south of Shejiard Settlement, 

 to about 25 feet near th(! western limit of the Skaneateles (|uadrangle, 

 and to"hbout 15 feet on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake (Aubuiii «. 

 qtiadrangle). 



As stated al)ove, the toj) of the Cardiff in the t>pc locality has 

 been defined by its authors as Ix-ing 20 feet below a liniestone baiul 

 in their Skaneateles. The writer regards this limestone band as 

 the ecjuivalent of the upper limy portions of the Mottville. and if 

 this correlation is correct there is very little room lor a Cardiff 

 formation between the hardir Mottville and the Marcellus of tlie 

 Aul>urn quadrangle. It is therefore believed that (in the absence 

 of positive diagnostic characters) the Canliff shale cannot be dilTer- 

 •cntiated as a separate unit west of the Skaneat<'les (juadrangle.

564 PROCEEDINOS OF THE ACADEMY < >!• I Dec, 



From tho westcni hounclary of the SkiUU'utclrs (juaclraiifflc to 

 Cayuga Lake continuous sections arc rare, but there is always some 

 reference jilane liy which to check tlie position of the MottviUe 

 beds. In the same area there are also some slight variations in 

 lithologic character, l)ut these are clearly of a progressive nature, 

 becoming more pronounced by slow degrees from east to west. 

 Paleontologic characters are well maintained throughout the region 

 in question and one more evidence of continuity is afforded by the 

 escarpment which is frequently produced by the harder layers. 



The more important sections met with in passing from tJie Tully 

 quadrangle to Cayuga Lake are shown slightly idealized in Plate 

 XXII. 



Section 2 is exposed in a ravine situated west of Cottle Hill and 

 about f mile from the western limit of the Skaneateles quadrangle. 

 The harder portions of the JMottville are well displayed at this 

 locality and their position relative to the black Marcellus is beyond 

 all question, for the section is continuous. About 1| miles south- 

 westerly at nearly the same altitude and on the Auburn quadrangle 

 is found another exposure of the Mottville crinoidal layer and asso- 

 ciated shales. Here unfortunately the black Marcellus is not 

 shown below in continuous section. It is exposed, however, at a 

 lower altitude in a near-by ravine within j mile to the west. The 

 relation is the same as that .shown in section 2. This easternmost 

 Mottville exposure on the Auburn quadrangle is an important one. 

 It can be connected by a nearly continuous escarpment with the 

 Mottville layers of section 2. It agrees in its lithologic and paleon- 

 tologic characters with other exposures of the Mottville. It lacks 

 only a continuous section to prove its stratigraphic position above 

 the Marcellus.- These points are emphasized, for this Mottville 

 exposure has apparently received a far different interpretation on 

 the geologic map of the Auburn quadrangle.'" 



A little .south of Half Acre and about If miles southwesterly from 

 the Auburn city line a good exposure of the Mottville member is 

 obtained. Here its position above the black Marcellus can be 

 determined in a nearly continuous section while the relations with' 

 the Agoniatites limestone and the Styliolina layers below it are 

 scarcely less clear.

 finds the following statement: "The Agoniatite limestone and adjaeent blaek

 third east and west road from the north line of the quadrangle."

limy character of the upper harder layers is pronouncetl. They 

 stand out as a prominent escarpment fur about l* miles between 

 Half Acre and Oakwood." Ea.st and a little south of Oakwood on 

 the boundary line l)etween the to^^'ns of Fleming and Springport 

 another good exposure of Muttville is found. At the pcjint where 

 the roadway on the map is marked with an altitude of 707 feet the 

 harder layers of the Mottville are finely displayed. As stated 

 al)Ove. these harder layers undergo a certain amount of progressive 

 change toward the west. They are now quite limy and of bluish 

 shades which iK'come lighter on exposure. Prolonged weathering 

 produces a tluller and more ru.sty appearance which, together with 

 numerous ''cauda-galli'" markings, causes a curious resemblance 

 to the very much higher beds which are usually assigned to the 

 Ludlowville. At this town line exposure the relations with tiic 

 Agoniatites limestone are again determinable, for the latter is exposed 

 in a field south of the road which parallels the Lehigh Valley track. 



At the f(jur corners which lie about 1?, miles south and a little 

 ea.st of Oakwood the Mottville is again displayed and is connected 

 by a fairly well-marked escarpment with the localities northeast. 

 Here at these four corners the relations with lower .strata can be 

 made out, the Agoniatites limestone outcropping at the slight bend 

 in the north-leading road I mile to the north, the Onondaga lime- 

 .stone and Styllollno layers by the roadside about I mile to the we.st. 

 The writer wishes to emi)hasize the fact that his interpretation of 

 the .stratigraphy between Half Acre and these four corners is based 

 on evidence furnished (1) by lithologic and paleontologic similarity 

 of the different Mottville exposures, (2) by the position of each 

 exposure with reference to some easily recognized lower stratum 

 and i'.i) by the occurrence of the exi)osures on the edge of a hard 

 rock platform which frecjuently displays :i well-marke(l escarpment 

 <m its northern and northwestern fronts. These lines (»f evidence 

 lead to a conee|)tion of the stratigraphy, which i> (|uite different 

 from that shf)wn on the geologic map of the .\ul)urii (|uadrangle.'- 



On approaching Cayuga Lake the harder portion of the MottvilU' 

 [)roduces the falls just east of the lake road in (Jreat dully Brook 

 and in the next brook south which is unnamed on the map.'"* This 

 latter is aj)p.'irently the Cri.stj's Hrook of Vunuxem and is called

Criss Croi'k l)y Luthor wlioso interpretation of its section socnis 

 to be as follows: The hartl layer producinfj; the falls near the lake 

 road bridge is "Near the top " of the " CardifT. " A "gray fossiliferous 

 band at the base of the formation" which occurs at the private road 

 crossing farther north is attributed to the horizon of the Stafford 

 limestone of western New York. 



The present writer's interi")retation of the same section may be 

 sunnnarized in this way: The hard layers making the falls near 

 the lake road bridge are the upper limy portion of the Mottville. 

 They are unilerlaid by about 15 feet of gray shale rich in small 

 fossils. These latter are the lower soft shales of the Mottville and 

 are considered the equivalent of strata which on the Tully cjuad- 

 rangle have been assigned to the Skaneateles by others. A short 

 distance below the lake road bridge their contact with the under- 

 lying black Marcellus is well displayed! The "gray fossiliferous 

 band'' exposed near the private road crossing farther down stream 

 is not connected by continuous section wdth the Mottville at the 

 lake road bridge. It has the same lithologic and paleontologic 

 characters as the lower 15 feet of Mottville at the lake road bridge. 

 It is also immeiliately overlaid by material indistinguishable from 

 the harder Mottville, while a short distance still farther down stream 

 another exposure of typical Marcellus is found. It is believed that 

 the lakeward dip which is plainly visible in places and a slight folding 

 are responsible for the repetition of the strata. 



This latter interpretation is amply confirmed by a study of the 

 lake shore sections east and west of the Lehigh Valley track between 

 Levanna and Farley's. It also appears to be in harmony with the 

 section of the region which was published by Cleland in 1903.^^ 



Summary of Observations. 

 The writer believes that the following points have been demon- 

 .st rated: 



(1) That the Marcellus black shale is continuous from the Tully 

 fjuadrangle to the east shore of Cayuga Lake (as stated in substance 

 by Vanuxem) and that it thins consideral)ly to the westward. 



(2) That the Cardiff shale, as defined l)y its authors, thins rapidly 

 toward the west and becomes unrecognizable as a separate unit 

 before the Auburn quadrangle is reached. 



(3) That the Mottville member (basal Skaneateles of the Tully 

 quadrangle) is continuous throughout the region, lying on the 



»« U. S. G. S. Bulletin 206, p. 21, fig. 2. 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 567 



Cardiff to the ea.st, but overlapping it and ouniing in contact with 

 the Marcellus to the wes^t. 



Theoretical Considerations. 



If the points outHned al)ove are admitted, a numlx-r of cjuestions 

 immechately arise. The first to be considered is this: How far 

 westward does the ovedap tyi)e of structure persist"' If it extends 

 to the western limit of the State involving each iiighcr unit in turn, 

 it is clear that younger and younger material will come to lie in 

 contact with the basal black shale. Much depends upon the deter- 

 mination of the western equivalent of the Mottville. Should it 

 prove referaiile to the Stafford limestone,'^ the present writer could 

 not escape the conclusion that the Stafford of western New York 

 is the equivalent of the lowermo.st Skaneateles of the central portions 

 of the State. In such a case the Stafford of western New York 

 separates not the ]\larcellus from the Cardiff, l)ut the Marcellus 

 from the bulk of the Skaneateles formation. 



If, on the other hand, the overlap westward goes no farther than 

 Cayuga Lake, we may be dealing with a north and south axis of 

 Onondaga limestone, on each side of which the shale units are repro- 

 duced in a similar stratigraphic succession. Though this view is 

 well within the bounds of possil)ility, it can hardly be said that the 

 known examples of the Onondaga-Marcellus c(mtact furnish evidence 

 in its support. 



Opportunity has not yet been fcjuiid for anything like a thorough 

 paleontological .study of the Mottville beds. The species so far 

 identified reveal a fauna not unlike that of the Stafford. It is 

 believed, however, that correlation ba-sed upon fossils alone is most 

 un.safe in determining the position of these Mottville strata. 



Heturning to the stratigraphic aspects of the problem, it may be 

 said that overlap in the structural sense can hardly be questioned.

That is (1) a fossilifcrous zone is s(>parat(Hl from a black shalo hy a 

 l^ed of l)arron gray shalo, (2) followtnl west the fossil zone is seen to 

 approach nearer and nearer to the black shale in successive sections, 

 (3) at the west the fossiliferous zone lies immediately above the 

 black shale. 



Such relations at least suggest an unconformity somewhere in the 

 series. The writer has, however, failed to discover positive evidence 

 of one in i)assing from the Onondaga to the Mottville. It is true 

 that the base of the Mottvillc lini>- layer is frequently very uneven. 

 The same observation likewise holds for the Agoniatites limestone. 

 Both cases are, however, regardcnl as due to a concretionary struc- 

 ture; limy segregations merely pushing downward into the strata 

 below. 



When considered in relation to the general black shale problem, 

 it is believed that the data obtained in this area go to strengthen the 

 theories which explain the Marcellus as an invasion from the east 

 and south toward the north and west.^** On the other hand, trans- 

 gression over a land surface is somewhat questionable; in fact, the 

 evidence rather points to a different conclusion. We are apparently 

 justified in regarding the Marcellus as a formation which, so to 

 speak, runs diagonally across the geologic column, its lower layers* 

 and more eastern portions being contemporary with some Onondaga 

 to the west while its upper and more western portions were probably 

 deposited at a time when Cardiff sedimentation was occurring to 

 the east. 



Evidence presentetl by Kindle" shows that black shale (presumably 

 Marcellus) deposition in the Allegheny region was taking place at 

 the same time with On(jndaga accumulation. For the particular 

 area here studied it is sufficient to call attention to the thin black 

 .shale intercalations which are found in the Onondaga .south of 

 Union Springs. The very gradual transition from Marcellus to 

 Cardiff and the general structure outlined in these notes both argue 

 for partial contemporaneity between Cardiff and Marcellus.

 pages and twenty-four plates have appeared. The Section has also 

 issued five hundred pages illustrated by twenty plates of the Ento- 

 mological News. 



Eighty pages and ten plates have been added to the Manual of 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 571 



CoNCHOLOGY, making tho output of the year 2,027 pages and 85 

 plates. 



The war lias interfered with the distribution of these publications 

 to correspondents as the International liureau of Exchange has 

 been forced to suspend coniniunication with Belgium, Clermany, 

 Austria, Russia, Servia, Bulgaria, and Roumania. The several 

 issues intended for these countries have, however, been directed and 

 stored away in anticipation of the happier time when they can be 

 sent to their destinations. 



Four members and ten corresj)ondents have been elected. The 

 deaths of thirteen members and three correspondents have brcn 

 announced. Resignations of membtiship were accepted fioiii Walter 

 M. .James and Edwin B. Bartram. 



(leorge \'au.\. .Jr., was reappointed l)y the ("ouncil the Solicitor 

 of the Acadeni}" Frank .J. Iveeley was continued as Curator of the 

 William S. \'aux Collections and Joseph Willcox as Custodian of the 

 Isaac Lea Collection of Eocene fossils. Dr. Spencer Trotter was 

 placed on the Library Committee to hll the vacancy caused l)y tlie 

 death of Dr. Thomas Biddle. 



The following courses of lectures have been deli\'ere(l in connection 

 with the Luflwick Institute: Witiiier Stone, three on wild bini life; 

 B. Franklin Royer. one on housing in relation to health; F. Herbert 

 Sncnv, one on Philadelphia's water supjily; Henry \. Pilsbry, three 

 on problems in the study of fauiia<; Henry Skinner, t hree on ento- 

 mology; Spencer Trotter, three on physiograi)hy and lile relations 

 of North .\merica; Stewardson lirown, three on local w ild Mowers. 



In liarriioii\- wit li t lie oii^itial intent i((n nl 1 lie bud wick Foundation,, 

 ten additional lectures were delivered on Wednesday afternoons 

 up to March to the teachers and classes of the (!irls' High School. 



A Committee of ( "onfeience with one representing the .\mericaii 

 Entomological S(»ciety considered carefully' a modification of t,he 

 articles of agreement providing for the union <»f the .\cademy and 

 the Society, Imt the result was not reached in time to be included 

 in this report. 



.Much the ino^t important e\-ent in the history of the .\cadeniy 

 during the |)ast year was the adoption, .lanuarx' M(, of amendments 

 to the By-Laws providing for the loaning of certain books from the 

 Library, reducing the munber of stated meetings to six. repealing 

 the re(|uir(inent of an initi.ation fee, an<l changing the proi-edun; 

 for the election of members. 



'IMiese amendments were adopted .Iaiiuar>' 1!) on the reconunenda- 

 tion of the ( "oiUK'il .and .are .as follows: 




572 IMIOCEKDIXCS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DoC, 



Chapter II. Art. 1: Change ''the last stated meetinji; of the 

 month" to "any stated meeting." 



Art. 2: Change first sentence to read "Candidates 

 for meml)ership shall be nominated in writing by at least two mem- 

 l)ers, who shall record the name and place of residence. The nomina- 

 tions shall be postetl in the Hall of the Academy and read before a 

 meeting of the Council and the candidate shall he balloted for at 

 any subsequent stated meeting, provided that at least two weeks 

 shall have elapsed since their nomination and posting. 



Art. 3: Change "fee of initiation" to "first annual 

 contribution." 



Art. 4: Change "fee of initiation" to "first annual 

 contribution." 



Art. 11: Change "fee of initiation" to "the annual 

 ■contribution. " 



Art. 13: Omit "an initiation fee of Ten Dollars and 

 -an" and substitute "the" for "an." 



Art. 14: Omit "and all initiatiim fees." 



Art. 17: Omit "who has not paid the initiation fee 

 or." 



Chapter IV, Art. 1: Omit the word "monthly" in the last sentence 

 ;and alter "day" to "days," i.e., to read: "days on which the meeting 

 shall be held. " 



Chapter IX, Art. 3 : Change to read "Certain books specified 

 by the Librarian and the Library Committee may be loaned to 

 members for a period of not exceeding one month. A list of such 

 books shall be prepared for the consultation of members and books 

 may be added to it or withdrawn from it at the discretion of the 

 Librarian and the Lil)rary ( 'ommittee. The Librarian shall keep a 

 record of all books loaned with the dates of loan and return. 



Chapter XII, Art. 1: Change the first clause to read "The stated 

 meetings of the Academy shall be held on the third Tuesdays of 

 November, December, January, February, March, and April." 



Art. 5: Insert "stated" before "meetings" in the 

 first line. 



Art. 6: The first line should read "The order of 

 business at the annual meetings shall be." 



It will he seen that several of the amendments merely conform 

 to the requirement of the changes specially referred to. ;, 



The effect of the By-Law authorizing the loaning of l)ooks is 

 stated in the report of the Librarian.

On the adoption of these amendments a new edition of the By- 

 Laws was printed and distributed. 



The usual .-societies have held meetings in the Academy during 

 the year. 



Edward J. Nolan, Recording Secretary. 



REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



The diminished volume of foreign correspondence and reduced 

 number of international scientific congresses commented upon in the 

 last annual report of the Corresponding Secretary' were even more 

 apparent in 1915, inasmuch as the conditions were operative through- 

 out the entire jear. 



Death collected an unusually heavy toll from the roll of corre- 

 spondents, including some of the most eminent, as follows: L^on 

 Vaillant, James (leikie. A. A. W. Hubrecht, Richard Lydekker, 

 Frederic W. Putnam, Theodor Boveri, George M. Sternberg, Edw. T. 

 Greene, Orville A. Derby, and H. E. Dresser. 



To insure a more systematic and careful examination into the 

 <lualifications of propo.<5ed candidates for correspondents, a committee 

 of Council on the nomination of correspondents was appointed. 

 I'pon the recommendation of this committee the following named 

 were nominated by the Council and elected by the Academy: 

 .\lfred C. Haddon. Wilhelm Ludwig Johanhsen, William Trelease, 

 Carl Dieiier, Samuel Wendell Wiliiston, Charles E. Barrois, Thomas 

 ChrowderCli:iiiil)eiliii. Albrecht Peiick.Williaiii liatesoii, and Stanislas 

 Meunier. 



The principal invitations received during the year were to the 

 inauguration exercises of Edward Kidder Graham as President of 

 the University of North Carolina, at which Profe.s.sor IT. V. Wilson 

 served as the representativ«' of this Academy; the twenty-fifth 

 anniversary of the fomiding of The Nebraska .Veademy <»f Sciences, 

 Professor George T. ^^)ore being our representative; the comnjence- 

 ment exercises (.f the I'niversity of Pittsburgh; the twenty-fifth 

 annual meeting of the ( )hio .Veademy of Science, to which Dr. Howard 

 Ayers went as our <lelegate; the fi/tieth anniversary of the adminis- 

 tration of Alexander V. <le Waldheim jus Director of the Imperial 

 Botanical Garden of Petrograd, which w;us acknowlNlged by a 

 letter of congratulation; and to the postponed meeting of the Nine- 

 teenth International Congress of .Vinericanists, which is to convene

 Walcott and Miss H. Newell Wardlc were last year appointed 

 ticlegatos. 



Letters thanking the Academy for conrtesies extended during the 

 Convocation Week meetings of 1915 were received from the American 

 Association for the AdvanctMuent of Science^ the Geological Society 

 of America, and the American Fern Society. 



Correspondence with individuals and institutions requesting 

 information on a variety of subjects was conducted as usual.

A well-bound copy of the Rev. J. (i, Wood'.s Animate Creation, in 

 three volumes, quarto, has been given to the Aeiuleniy by Mi.ss 

 Ella B. AIternu.><, in memory of the late William Wilkin.son Altemu.s. 



The notai)le (leerea.se in the number of addition.^ to the Lil)rary 

 during 1915 has been due to two eause.«;: A le.s.sening of. api)roi)ria- 

 tion.'^, but more es|)eeially the interference with foreign correspondence 

 by the horrible war which is, in one way or another, alTecting every 

 Inmian interest, most of them disastrously. The (iennan production 

 of scientific puldications was at first sustained, but is now decreasing. 

 Out of sixty-nine (lerman periodicals .subscribed for nothing has been 

 received from twenty-one of tln-m. The Mnglish journals continue 

 as usual, ami the French, while much alTecled ;it first, are now for 

 the mf»st part going on as before the war. We have been wjirned 

 by the Royal .\ea<lemy of tin- Ijiicei, the Royal .\<'ademy of Sei<'nces 

 of I'etrograd, Jiiid the ('hemical S«)ciety of London that i.s.stics for- 

 warded now must bi' at oiu* risk, as hrs.se.s, if any o(<-ur, will not 

 be made up. In llie.se ca.ses it has been thought be.st to ask for a 

 j)rompt supply of publications, assuming such risk a;* may be in- 

 volved, for it will i)robabIy not be more than we should nm in 

 expecting the volumes in bulk at the end of the conflict. 




578 PROCEEDINGS OF TIIK A( ADKMV OF [DeC, 



Shipments from (Icrmaiiy and Austria were stopped by a liritish 

 Order in Council in .hme. We are informed, however, that the 

 British (lovernment is now ])rej)ared to issue ))ermits for siiipment 

 of scientific hoolcs to the United States from Ciermany and Austria 

 if destined for universities, colleges, scientific societies or public 

 bodies. We may profit durinji the cominjj year i)v this relaxation, 

 although it is accompanied l)y a great deal of aimoying retl tape. 



The interruption of exchange noted in the report of the Recording 

 Secretary of course greatly affects the receipts from corresponding 

 societies. Even when regular shipments are made invoices and 

 l)ills of lading are held up on the other side and insufficient steamer 

 acconnnodations cause uncertain deliveries. 



Chapter IX, Art. 3, of the By-Laws was amended in January so 

 as to permit of the loaning to members of certain books specified by 

 the Librarian and the Library Committee for a jieriod not exceeding 

 one month. 



Although it was held l)y ]\Li('lure and his contemporaries that all 

 books belonging to the Academy should Ije exclusively for use within 

 the Ijuilding, both for the good of those working on the premises 

 and to le.ssen the danger of loss, it was considered that such a rule 

 was not practicable until the services of a Librarian during portions 

 of the day could l)e secured. Certain designated books were there- 

 fore permitted to be Ijorrowed until 1850, when Thomas B. Wilson 

 presented to the Academy the extremely valuable works which he 

 had from time to time deposited with the understanding that they 

 should never be loaned on any condition. This applied to such an 

 important portion of the Library that the rule was then made 

 general and from 1850 until last January no books were knowingly 

 allowed to leave the building except to be bound. 



Since the new rule has been in operation forty-six works in fifty- 

 eight volumes have been borrowed. These have all been returned 

 but two, which are now alone outstanding. 



A system of registry of works taken for use in the Academy's 

 study rooms has been adopted. 822 titles in 1,061 volumes have 

 been placed at the service of students and workers in tlie building. 

 375 of these are still in use. 



While a few of the l^ooks taken from the building have rnanifestly 

 been for more or less desultory reading, the others have undoubtedly 

 been for serious consultation and study, so that there is reason to believe 

 that the operation of the new law is, as far as it goes, for the advance- 

 ment of science without any counterbalancing disadvantage. By 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 579 



direction of the Council, no volumes or parts of journals or periodicals 

 may be borrowed without the special consent of the Librarian, who 

 must be reasonai)ly sure, before the pul)lication is sent out. that the 

 interests of those working on the premises will not be iiitcrfcnMl witii 

 by the loan. 



As required i)y the By-Law. a separate list of books that can be 

 borrowed is being prepared anl is nearing completion. 



A very desirable subject index to the map collection has Ijeen 

 prepared 1)V Mr. Fox. 



Forty-seven volumes of works not connected with the Acadt'my's 

 interests have been transferred to the Free Library of Philadelphia. 



A framed photograi)h of Rembrandt Peale's oil jiortrait of Ueul)en 

 Haines, who served most efficiently as Corresponding Secretary 

 from February, 1814, to December, 1831, has been pre.sented l)y his 

 grandson, Reuben Haine>. 



A framed photograph from life of the late Dr. Benjamin Sharji 

 has been received from Mrs. Sharp. 



Through the lii)erality of a number of subscribers, there has been 

 obtained a replica of the portrait of Baron \'on Humboldt, painted 

 from life in 185G In' J. R. Lambdin, and now in the rooms of the Ameri- 

 can Philosophical Society. The picture has been beautifully framed 

 by the President of the Academy. 



It is pleasant to again acknowledge the good work done by William 

 J. Fox and Furman Sheppard Wilde, both in the Lil)r;ir\- and in 

 connection with the issue of the publications.

]?KPnRT OF THE rTRATORS. 



The completion of the year 1'.>1.') finds the .Vcademy'.- huiMings 

 and collections in excellent condition. .Much important work has 

 been accompli.shed in studying, arranging, and cataloguing mat«'rial 

 in the several departments of the Museum, and maii>' important 

 accessions have been received through gift or purchase. 



The number (»f visitors to the Museum has steadily increased, 

 especially classes from the schools of Philadelphia and vicinity 

 which come to study the exhibits under the guidance of tlw'ir teachers. 



.Vt the last session of the State Legislature the sum of .^lOjCMIO was 

 appropriated to the .\cademy for tlie purchase of casen. and arrange- 

 ments have been made to furni>h the north wing of the Museum 

 with exhibition cases .so that it may be reopened to the pui)lic during 




580 PROCEEDINGS OF TIIK ACADKMY OF [DcC, 



the ensuing year, and to provide iniu'li needed exhibition antl storage 

 cases in the various departments. 



During tlie past year the Curators have purehased three large 

 mahogany and platc-glass exhibition cases, one for a group of buffalo 

 and two for the collection of wood of native forest trees. Two 

 horizontal oak cases have also been procured for the William S. Vaux 

 archaeological collection, as well as eighteen metal storage cases, 

 450 trays and 100 insect boxes. 



Mr. Clarence B. Moore continued his explorations among the 

 Indian mountls of the Southern States, the results of which have been 

 generously added to the Clarence B. Moore Collection. 



A valuable collection of Antarctic material obtained on Sir Ernest 

 Shackletou's expedition was presented by Mr. John H. McFadden. 

 The framed photographs of scenery and animals have been placed 

 on exhibition in the lower hallways and the other specimens 

 arranged in the several departments. 



Leave of absence was granted to several members of the Museum 

 staff for the prosecution of field work. Through the liberality of 

 Mr. Morgan Hebard, Mr. J. A. G. Rehn was enabled to accompany 

 him on a two months' trip through the Gulf States from northern 

 Florida to eastern Texas, for the purpose of studying the Orthoptera 

 of the region, one-half of the material obtained becoming the property 

 of the Academy. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry spent the greater part of August and Septem- 

 ber in an exploration of the Black Range of New Mexico, obtaining^ 

 large series of land moUusks, part of them new to science, as well as 

 collections of reptiles and plants. 



Mr. Stewardson Brown accompanied Dr. and Mrs. N. L. Britton 

 on a botanical expedition to Porto Rico, and Dr. Witmer Stone 

 did .some general collecting in California and Minnesota, incidental 

 to attending the meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union 

 in San Franci.sco. 



The usual amount of local field work was also carried on. 



Details of Museum work in the various departments follow. 



Mammals. 



A fine group of three buffalo, a bull, cow and calf, which had been 

 previously mounted, was arranged in a large exhibition case secured 

 during the year. It adds much to the attractiveness of the mammal 

 hall. 



The skeletons of the Right, Hump-back and Sperm Whales have 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 581 



been articulated and mounted in the centres of the geological and 

 mineralogical halls and attract much attention. This work was 

 done by the Academy's taxidermist, Mr. David McCadden, assi.sted 

 by Mr. E. W. Stucke. 



The collection of skins of the larger mainiiials was carefully gone 

 over during the year and systematically arranged Ijy Dr. Witmer 

 Stone, while the entire osteological collection was systematized and 

 labelled by Mr. Earl L. Poole, a student on the Jessup Fund. This 

 collection is now readily accessible and its usefulness vastly increased. 



Twenty-six mammals have l)een received from the Zoological 

 Society of Philadelphia during the year, which have been variously 

 prepared by the taxidermist as skins or osteological material. 



A .set of the ]\Ic(lregor restorations of Pithecanthropus and other 

 early anthroj^oid and human types was presented by Dr. Samuel CJ. 

 Dixon. 



Numerous students have made use of the collections during the 

 year and specimens have been loaned to Drs. J. A. Allen aiul C. Hart 

 Merriam, Messrs. W. H. Osgood an<l IF. A\'. Tfenshaw. 



Birds. 



The rearrangement and renovation of the study .series of birds 

 have progressed satisfactorily during the year and only five families 

 of the Pa.sseres and the Steganopodes still demand attention. Mr. 

 D. E. Culver, student on the Je.ssup Fund, has relaxed the old 

 unmounted specimens and remade many of the skins, whih; Dr. 

 Witmer Stone has .sy.stematically arranged and labelled th(; groups 

 as they were completed. He has also entirely rearranged the local 

 stu(h' .series of laud birds, bringing all of the local material together 

 for the first time. 



A number of specimens have been idenfified for the Zoological 

 Society and for corres|)ondents. 



Mr. Sanuiel X. Klioads, accompanie<| li\- Mr. liar! L. Poole, 

 undertook an exjiedition to (luatemala, from February t<» .Vpril, in 

 the interests of the Acadetny. the expenses being met partly by the 

 Academy and partly by Mr>. Heiilah M. Khoads and William P. 

 KIkinton. 



A fine series of about 700 bir<l>, a numiier of mammah and <ome 

 specimens in otln-r branches were obtain<'d. 



Besides this material an additional .series of birds fron^ Santa .Marta, 

 Colombia, was purchased, a.s well a.s a .series of I\'trels from South 

 (jeorgia Islan<l. 




582 PROCEEDINCS OF TIIK ACADKMY OF [DcC, 



Till' Di'lawaii' Nallry (.)riiitliolojj;ical Club has added a nuinlxT of 

 rare and valuable specimens to the local collection and otlur local 

 material was receivetl from various sources. 



Six metal-covered storage cases were substituted for the old 

 wooden cases formerly used for the larger birds and the specimens 

 arranged to much lietter advantage. By the end of next year it is 

 expecteil that the entire collection of skins will be accommodated 

 in metal cases. 



Mr. James P. Chapin spent two tlays studying the Academy's 

 t>pe series of \\'est African birds and Mr. Hhoads has spent con- 

 siderable time in the department preparing a report on his Guatemala 

 collection. 



Many local students have made use of the study collection and 

 specimens have been loaned to Drs. F. M. Chapman, C. W. Rich- 

 mond. Messrs. R. Ridg-\vay, W. E. C. Todd, C. B. Cory, H. K. Coale 

 and R. C. Murphy. 



Reptiles and Batrachians. 



This department has, as in 1914, been under the charge of 

 Mr. Henry W. Fowler. All accessions have been identified and 

 cared for, 153 having been tagged, catalogued and distributed. 

 The entire series of Salamanders has been critically studied and rear- 

 ranged and a collection of reptiles and batrachians from Porto Rica 

 has been identified for Princeton University, in return for which 

 service the Academy received a fine series of duplicates. Mr. E. R. 

 Dunn has .spent much time studying the collections in this department 

 and Dr. Thomas Barbour spent two days examining some of the 

 types. Several specimens were loaned to Dr. Barbour. 



Fishes. 



In this department, which is also under Mr. Fowler's care, much 

 important work has been accomplished. Mr. Fowler has catalogued, 

 labelled and distributed 3,648 specimens during the year. He has also 

 prepared and published papers on collections of fishes from Canada 

 and tropical America, and has made a critical study of the Killi-fishes 

 and their allies. 



MOLLUSKS. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, special curator of this department, reports 

 that accessions have been received during the year from 82 persons 

 anrl in.stitutions. Among the more extensive accessions are a series 




1915.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 583 



from Wa.shington and Oregon, roceivcd from Mr. Jutiii .\. Allen; 

 Antarctic shells of the Sir Ernest Shackleton Expedition, from 

 Mr. John H. McFaddcn. and Mexican shells fnnn ('. H. Orcutt. 

 Messrs. Clarence B. Moore, Morgan Hehard. S. S. Berry and others 

 have made many gifts of southern and western shells, and Mr. 

 I^ayard Long has continued his collections in New Jersey. 



The J(jlm Ford collection of Olividd, purchased during the year, 

 when added to that of the Academy, forms j)rol)al)ly the most 

 extensive series of the.se shells in any museum. 



With Mr. James H. Ferriss, the special curator spent the greater 

 part of August and September in an exploration of the Black Range 

 of New Mexico, ol)taining large .series of land moUusks, part of them 

 new to .science. 



We have also i)een favored with a complete .scries of tiie mollusks 

 taken l)y Messrs. Junius Henderson and D. !•>. Daniels. wIkj collected 

 in many localities from Provo, Utah, to Franklin in southern Idaho. 



The .study of Hawaiian material of the expedition of 1913 has 

 been continued throughout the year. The family TorndtelUnidcc 

 has i)een completed, and a monograph i)ublished in the Manu.^l of 

 CoNCHOLOOY, Volume XXIII. The proportion of unde.scribed 

 forms proved to l)e unusually large, the volume containing descrip- 

 tions of 103 new species and 29 new subspecies. Dr. C. Montague 

 Cooke, of the Bi.shop Museum, Honolulu, collaborated with the 

 special curator in this work. 



Mr. E. C. \anatta, assistant in the department, has been chietly 

 occupied in the determination and labelling of specimens received. 

 Miss Caroline Ziegler has continued the work of cataloguing the 

 collection. 



The Wheatley collection of fresh-water shells has been deposited 

 by the Fniversity of Pennsylvania, and some jirogress has been mM<le 

 in cleaning, lal)elling and cataloguing the specimens. 



During the year the collections have been studied by .Messrs. 

 (leorge H. Clapp, Frank M. .\nderson, Drs. W . II. Dall and \. 

 Ol.s.sen, while mat<'rial lias been loaned to Drs. \\ . II. Dall and Paul 

 Bartsch, Messrs. Junius Hend«'r.son and J. I*>. II< ndrrson. 



Insects. 



Dr. Henry Skinner, head of the department of Insects, reports 

 that much of his time and that of Mr. E. T. Cresson,»Jr., luus been 

 flevoted to relaxing and mounting the new material ac(|uin'<l. Por- 

 tions of the collection have also been rearranged in tin- new cases 

 procured during the year. 




584 PROCEEDINGS OK THK ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



In the onlor Dipt era the families Tipulidse aiul Dolichopodidse 

 have been rearranged. 



In the Coleoptera the labelHng of the Horn types has been con- 

 tinued and the rearrangement of the family Scarabicidie completed. 



In the Hymenoptera, the rearrangement of the Ophionini and 

 Pimplinir has been finished. 



In the Lepidoptera, the Welles collection was safely transported 

 from EhvjTi, Pa., and the following families rearranged: Agrotinse, 

 Syntomidtp, Saturnidse, Lyctenida?, and the exotic Nymphalidae and 

 part of the Pierida?. The genera Kallima, Papaipema and Autographa 

 were also rearranged. 



In the Orthoptera the series of the genera Orchelimum, Cono- 

 cephalus and Atlanticus have been rearranged in the new type of 

 double box, which was all the general rearrangement possible during 

 the year with the few boxes available. 



Mr. J. A. G. Rehn spent two months in the field in company with 

 Mr. ^Morgan Hebard, working in the Gulf States from northern 

 Florida to eastern Texas. The trip, which was highly successful, 

 resulted in securing a very large series from the most neglected 

 portion of the eastern States, of which collection the Academy will 

 receive one-half. 



Mr. Hebard has continued his studies, based very largely on the 

 material in his own collection, here deposited, and in the Academy 

 series. He has also continued to maintain a preparator, whose 

 services as in the past have l^een given very liberally to the Academy. 

 By his aid it was possible to have mounted practically all the 

 previously unmounted Orthoptera owned l^y the Academy. In 

 collaboration with Mr. Hebard, Mr. Rehn has completed the final 

 portion of an extensive paper on the Orthoptera of the southeastern 

 United States, which was based largely on the field work conducted 

 under the auspices of the Academy. The same authors have made a 

 synoptical study of the genus Atlanticus and progress has been made 

 on a similar treatment of the genus Mermiria. 



Mr. Rehn has been and is at present engaged in studying extensive 

 Brazilian collections, of which the Academy will receive the first 

 set of such material as it does not already possess. He has also 

 made some additional progress with the study of the extensive 

 African collections placed in his hands by other institutions, but 

 owing to the greater urgency of other work this has been temporarily 

 laid aside. 



A large number of visiting entomologists have studied the coUec-

Mr. H. W. Fowler has looked after the aleoholie material and 

 arranged numerous small local collections of spiders, Crustacea, etc. 

 Mr. J. H. Emerton has studied the series of sjMclers during the year. 

 Specimens of annelids have been loaned to Dr. ( ". A. Kofoid, and 

 J. F. Daniel. 



I N \ KRTK H 1{ATE FosSIL.S. 



Dr. A. p. I^rown has spent considerable time at the Academy 

 during the summer months studying the collections in this depart- 

 ment and in conjunction with Dr. Pilsbry has prepared a report on 

 the Oligocene fossils obtained l)y Mr. Lloyd B. Smith in Colombia. 



Drs. A. Olsen and L. W. Stephenson have .spent some time studying 

 the collections, and material has been loaned to F. W. Stanton and 

 T. Wayland \'aughan. 



\'krtk URATE Fossils. 



The large slabs of fossil footprints together with certain geological 

 specimens have been arraiige(| on the wall spaces between the windows 

 in the mineralogical hall. 



Material was loane(l during the year to Drs. ( ). P. Hay ami .1. C. 

 Merriam, and in return for the courtesy Dr. Merriam i)resented the 

 Academy with a specimen of Smilodon from the asphalt deposits 

 of the Uancho La Brea. California.

Work has . niH'cssaril}' been nuiinly confined to carinff for the 

 acces.sions. Miss Ada Allen has continuod with the mounting of 

 the specimens and has prepared for cataloguing and distribution 

 3,150 sheets. Mr. \'an Pelt has mounted all accessions to the local 

 collection, amounting to 3,114 sheets and including 004 from the 

 Porter herl)arium, which have been distinctively labelled in accordance 

 with the agreement with Lafayette College, by which institution 

 they were deposited. 



Mr. Long has distributed and identified material added to the 

 local herbarium and made critical studies of various groups. He 

 has also attended to much correspondence in connection with the 

 general collection. 



The herbarium has been consulted during the year by Dr. C. S. 

 Sargent, W. W. Eggleston, Harold St. John, Francis Pennell and 

 manj' others, and specimens have been loaned to W. W. Eggleston, 

 P. C. Standley, Dr. H. H. Howe, Dr. J. C. Arthur, K. K. McKenzie, 

 B. H. Smith, Dr. C. S. Sargent, Dr. F. Pennell. Harold St. John, 

 Dr. J. ^L Greenman. Prof. ]\L L. Fernald. 



The collection of trunk sections of native trees of the Alleghanies 

 presented by Mr. C. H. Jennings has been prepared for exhibition 

 and placed in two mahogany and plate-glass cases in the mineralogical 

 hall just outside the entrance to the herbarium, where it attracts 

 much attention. 



Minerals and Rocks. 



Mr. S. G. Gordon, under the direction of Mr. Frank J. Keeley, 

 Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections, has completed a check 

 list of minerals according to the sixth edition of Dana's Manual 

 as an aid in the rearrangement of the collection which will be under- 

 taken during the coming year. 



Several of the cases in the hall were rearranged and part of the 

 specimens transferred to cases presented by the Curwin Stoddart 

 Estate. 



Mr. Gordon has also redetermined most of the rock specimens 

 and in part relabelled them, while many minerals in the general 

 collection have also been redetermined. Many members of the 

 Geological Society of America took occasion to examine the collec- 

 tions during the annual meeting of the Society at the Academy, in 

 December, 1914.
