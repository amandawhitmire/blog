NOTES ON SOME IGNEOUS ROCKS AT OGUNftUIT, MAINE, AND PIGEON 



COVE, MASS. 



BY FRANK J. KEELEY, 



It would probably be difficult to find a more remarkable display of 

 igneous rocks than that along the coast of Alaine south of Ogunquit. 

 Here for a couple of miles the shale, dipping nearly vertically, is 

 penetrated by almost innumerable dikes, vaiying from a few inches 

 to over fifty feet in thickness and showing great variety in color and 

 texture. 



The shale itself, as the result of these numerous intrusions, has 

 been metamorphosed and indurated until it is frequently as hard 

 as the igneous dikes. Fresh fractures are usually gray with faint 

 indications of differently constituted lamina, but on the weathered 

 surfaces the various layers assume different colors, often producing 

 a decidedly striped appearance resembling banded jasper, becoming 

 particularly noticeable in the rounded pebbles Occasionally lining 

 the shore. Numerous ramifying veins of white and yellow quartz 

 further characterize the shales, and the extremely rugged character 

 of the coast line, with several coves and an overhanging cliff exceeding 

 fifty feet in height, together with the almost unlimited variation 

 in color due to weathering of the shale and its igneous intrusives, has 

 resulted in this section becoming a favorite haunt of artists. From 

 early times it has likewise attracted the attention of geologists, and 

 in the first geological survey of Maine, published in 1838, Charles T. 

 Jackson gives considerable space to the description of the features 

 of this district and calls attention to the manner in which some of 

 the dikes intersect each other, as indicating that the igneous intru- 

 sions can be referred to at least three periotls. 



During the past summer, with the view of becoming better 

 acquainted with the petrographical character of these rocks, I 

 collected a number of specimens, from which I have since prepared 

 sections and studied them microscopically. The locality receiving 

 particular attention was a small cove on Israel's Head, between the 

 mouth of the Ogunquit River and Lobster Point. Here a patch of 

 sand beach, used by the guests of the Ontio and Lookout Hotels 

 as a bathing place, is surrounded by the usual shales of the region, 




4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



penetrated by several dikes and intrusions of igneous rocks. A 

 series of these rocks was collected and this particular place selected 

 for the purpose, not only because the intrusions seemed to include the 

 principal tj'pes of igneous rocks, but also for the reason that they are 

 located where they can be readilj^ identified from the description by 

 anyone interested. 



Commencing with the rocky point which extends out to low-water 

 mark on the north of the bathing beach, this is penetrated by a dike 

 about twelve feet thick of diabase porphyrite with jihenocrysts of 

 plagioclase too much zoizitised for specific identification, in a matri.x 

 of diabasic texture, composed of augite, biotite, plagioclase, and 

 chlorite, the latter apparently altered pyroxene; also as accessory 

 constituents, titanite, apatite, and secondary calcite. Dr. F. Bascom, 

 who kindly looked over these sections with me, suggests that the 

 reason much of the pyroxene is entirely fresh or in part altered to 

 hornblende, while in other cases it is completely replaced by chlorite, 

 is probably that there may have been two distinct varieties of pyrox- 

 ene originally present, one more readily altered than tiie other. 

 Near contact with the shale, this dike becomes basaltic in texture, a 

 fine-grained mixture of feldspar, biotite, magnetite, and brown horn- 

 blende, the latter no doubt replacing primary pyroxene, with pheno- 

 crysts having the outlines of j^yroxene, almost invariably completely 

 altered to chlorite. 



A short distance toward the south, in the rocky wall back of the 

 beach, is a twelve-inch dike of diabase with a small branch dike 

 forking frou> it. Except that it contains a few small vesicles filled 

 with secondary calcite, this is a typical diabase, fine and uniformly 

 grained. Beyond it is a dike of basalt, four to eight inches thick. 

 At the contact it is gla.ssy, with lath-shaped feldspars oriented parallel 

 to the wall. The interior is inor(> completely crystalline, with 

 plienocrysts of pyroxene altered to chlorite and many small, rounded 

 patches of calcite, aj^parently filling vesicles. 



Further south is an irregular angular intrusion of trachyte. It 

 consists almost exclusively of intermeshed rods of feldspar, apparently 

 orthocla.se somewhat kaolinized, with scattered patch(>s of ferru- 

 ginous material slightly translucent and dark red in color when 

 sufficiently thin, also generally red by reflected light. This rock 

 corres]}onds in texture to the dyke rocks which have received the 

 name of bostonite, but in the absence of any microscopical evidence 

 of the presence of anorthoclase, a chemical analysis would probably 

 lie necessary to determine whether it should \n- so classed. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 5 



Next comes another dike of diabase, characterized by the presence 

 of considerable pyrite, which occurs in rounded aggregates, filling 

 the interstices between crystals of augite and plagioclase. It also 

 contains vesicular cavities averaging about a millimeter in diameter, 

 filled with calcite and a little quartz, margined by acicular secondary- 

 hornblende. 



Somewhat south of the beach is a large intrusion having an irregu- 

 larly rhomboidal outline, consisting of trachyte porphyry with large 

 orthoclase phenocrysts in a felsitic matrix containing some horn- 

 blende and a little quartz. 



Four sections were made from specimens of the shale associated 

 with dikes mentioned, one broadly striped, another showing finer 

 laminations, and the remaining two of rather uniform texture. All 

 are highly silicious, including quartz grains up to a half millimeter 

 in diameter scattered among finer grains of quartz and some secondary 

 minerals, chiefly micas, sometimes biotite, and in one sample, a bright 

 green mica. The extent of metamorphosis is indicated by apparent; 

 metosomatic penetration of the secondary minerals into some of the 

 primary quartz grains. Striping, when present, is due to the concen- 

 tration of such secondary minerals in layers, which in the original 

 sediment were probably less purely silicious than the rest. 



Beyond a gully south of Lobster Point is a very noticeable dike 

 about five feet in diameter, transected at an acute angle by another 

 of same size. The first may be classed as a diabase porphyrite and 

 contains vesicles about a millimeter in diameter such as characterize 

 so many of the dikes here, but in this case there is about as much 

 quartz as calcite in the cavities, while generally the filling is entirely 

 of calcite. This rock also contains much pyrite in the form of isolated 

 grains in the interior of the dike, but in clouds of minute particles 

 several millimeters across, in the basaltic textured rock near the 

 contact. The other dike is an olivine diabase, notable for numerous 

 large idiomorphic phenocrysts of olivine now completely altered to 

 serpentine of unusually high double refraction, apparently consisting, 

 in part at least, of chrysotile, showing development along irregular 

 cracks, so characteristic of the alteration process in olivine. 



Possibly a mile further south, beyond Perkin's Cove, there is 

 exposed on the shore an extensive intrusion of diabase, under which 

 there is a water-worn cave between tide levels, locally known as the 

 Devil's Kitchen. This rock is a rather coarse-grained diabase with 

 some primary biotite, in which the augite is perfectly fresh, but 

 another ferro-magnesian constituent originally present has been 




6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



completely altered to a browTi serpentine-like material sometimes 

 apparently mixed with felted masses of biotite and chlorite. This 

 may have been an orthorhombic pyroxene, as slight traces of it 

 remaining in the heart of a couple of the brown areas showed parallel 

 extinction, and it has none of the characteristics of olivine. In 

 addition to the usual magnetite, apatite is present as an accessory 

 mineral, but not at all plentifully. 



While the indurated shale is continuous along the sea coast for a 

 couple of miles south of Ogunquit, granite outcrops at a number of 

 places not far back from the shore, as at Pine Hill and further to the 

 west at ]\It. Agamenticus. It is hornblendic at the outcrops noticed, 

 but I did not collect or further study any specimens. Some additional 

 collections of dyke rocks were, however, made just north of Ogunquit 

 on the road to Portland. Here, in widening the road, several outcrops 

 have been cut away, leaving fresh exposures. One such is located 

 on east side of road about one-eighth niilc north of the car barn and 

 shows three different igneous rocks penetrating or in contact with 

 each other. Toward the south, there is first a gray, medium fine- 

 grained diabase, then a compact black basalt. A section of the 

 contact demon-;t rates that the basalt was a later flow than the 

 diabase. Next to it comes a coarse diabase porphj'rite with feldspar 

 phenocrysts, sometimes exceeding an inch in length, and beyond this 

 another fine-grained diabase, and then indurated shale similar to that 

 descriiied from the shore. 



On the west si(h' of the road, (me-eighth mile further towar^ the 

 noitli, is another good exposure of dial)ase porphyrite, in which the 

 ])lienocrys1s are developed to an extent that they apjjear to make 

 up more than half the rock, in contact with basalt of later origin. 



For com])aris()n, I give th(^ following brief descrijition of igneous 

 rocks at Pigeon Cove, Mass., where years ago I collected and studied 

 specimens from the dikes along a similar short section of the shore. 

 The end of ("ai)e Ann consists of light gray hornblende granite, 

 c}uarried extensively for commercial ])urposes. Its feldspar is 

 almost exclusively microcline and the hornblende is generally accom- 

 panied by l)iotite. This granite is ]ienetrated by many igneous 

 dikes, although these are not so numerous or varied in character as 

 those at Ogunquit. 



Near the extreme point of the cape, known as Andrew's Point, 

 below an unfinished sc|uare stone tower, is a dike of solvsbergite, 

 a uniformly crystalline mixture of plagioclase with hornblende 

 showing pleochroism from olive to indigo-blue, much finer grained in 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 7 



an offshoot which extends into a parallel crack in the granite. A 

 block of granite which has been picked up by the molten dike rock 

 is exposed in the interior of the latter. 



East of this is an extensive intrusion of quartz porphyrj', so classed 

 from the general characteristics of the whole mass, rather than from 

 the microscopical examination of individual sections, some of which 

 would otherwise rank as fine-grained granites, while others show a 

 few phenocrysts and patches of micro-pegmatite. Within this 

 intrusion are segregations containing crystals of hornblende several 

 . inches long and large masses of blue quartz. It has been injected 

 with diorite, but as it does not split in straight lines like the granite, 

 no regular dike is exposed. The diorite has forced its way irregularly 

 among the fragments of the older rock, some of which are included 

 in it. The diorite consists of a fine-grained mixture of hornblende, 

 biotite, and triclinic feldspar, with a few phenocrysts of zoizitised 

 plagioclase and occasionally a small one of light colored pyroxene. 

 It is intersected by numerous small white veins, no doubt of secondary 

 origin, and consisting in one section examined of feldspar, both 

 orthoclase and plagioclase, and light colored pyroxene. 



To the south, the dike of solvsbergite, which crosses the point, 

 again appears, and further on a sharply defined dike of quartz 

 porphyry several feet thick. Still further south are three small 

 dikes of diorite, differing from that at the point in several minor 

 respects. There is but little biotite, and the hornblende is of a bluish- 

 green color. No veins were noted, and the smallest dike, which is 

 but a few inches thick, is very fine-grained and free from phenocrysts. 

 They are probably all derived from the same source. 



Beyond them comes another series of dikes, all no doubt of similar 

 origm. They are, respectively, two to three inches, twenty-eight 

 inches, sixteen inches, and eighteen feet in thickness, the latter just 

 below the Ocean View Hotel, while further on is still another nearly 

 as large. The larger dikes are typical fully crystallized diabases, 

 coarser or finer grained according to size of dike, with unaltered 

 constituents and basaltic texture near the contacts. The two- to 

 three-inch dike is basaltic throughout. It passes close to a swimming 

 pool blasted out of the rocks, and is visible over the sloping shore 

 for a couple of himdred feet, occupying a crack in the granite as 

 straight and sharply defined as if cut with a knife. 



The sixteen-inch dike is admirably adapted for illustrating the 

 effect of quick or slow cooling on an igneous rock, as it has an offshoot 

 or branch, three-eighths to two inches thick, extending into the 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



granite. Where three-eighths to one-half inch thick, chips of the rock 

 are procurable which permit of sections being made showing the 

 granite penetrated by the small dike. Here the matrix is an almost 

 opaque gla.ss with plagioclase rods and phenocrysts of augite. AVhen 

 it becomes three-fourths inch thick, a slight tendency toward crystal- 

 lization of the matrix is noticeable in the centre, and so on until the 

 middle of the main dike is reached, where but little trace of the 

 basaltic texture remains and the rock is a characteristic diabase. 

 A similar series of sections can of course be made by starting from 

 the contact in one of the larger dikes, hut the transition from basalt 

 to diabase is much more sudden. 



Two other rocks occurring nearby, hut not appearing on the shore 

 line just considered, are worthy of mention. One is a highly por- 

 phyritic andesite with phenocrysts sometimes two inches long, 

 indicated by their extinction angles to be oligoclase, in a matrix 

 consisting of uralite, biotite, and plagioclase. This rock is not well 

 exposed at Pigeon Cove. I have noted an outcrop in a door yard 

 near centre of village and another in a hollow west of what is known 

 as Sunset Rock, but across Sandy Bay it appears as a sharply defined 

 dike in the granite, on the shore lictween Rockport and Straits- 

 mouth. .\s the granite here seems cai)able of cleaving in a straight 

 line for an indefinite distance and the three exposures are approxi- 

 mately in line, although widely separated, they may all pertain to 

 the same dike. The other rock referred to occurs in a cut leailing 

 from the shore to the Rockport Quarry, near the archway under 

 main road. It is a light brown crystalline rock which proved to 

 consi.st entirely of micro-pegmatite, the l)est example I have .seen of 

 this intergrowth of quartz and microcline.

ON A COLLECTION OF MAMMALS FHOM ECTTADOR. 



BY WITMER STONE. 



Mr. Samuel N. Rhoads made a collecting trip to Ecuador, February- 

 July, 1911, and secured a valuable series of vertebrates. His entire 

 colledtion was purchased by the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 Philadelphia, and reports on the fishes and reptiles have already 

 appeared in the Proceedings.' The mammals, comprising sixty- 

 eight specimens, referable to nineteen species, were obtained for the 

 most part on the paramo and the region immediately below, on 

 Mt. Pichincha, 10,000-1.3,000 feet, while a few additional specimens 

 were obtained from the mountains above Chaml)o, from the Pagma 

 forest near Chunchi, 7,000 feet, and from Bucay, province of Guayas, 

 975 feet. 



As the Academy previously possessed no naanunals whatever from 

 the Andes, the satisfactory identification of much of Mr. Rhoads' 

 material was rendered impossible until such specimens could be 

 secured for comparison. Upon his return from Peru, Mr. Wilfred H. 

 Osgood, being anxious to make comparisons with certain Ecuador 

 species, generously offered to compare Mr. Rhoads' specimens with 

 the series in the Field Museum in return for their use in the iilentifica- 

 tion of his Peruvian mammals. This he has don(> and has given me 

 his opinion as to their relationships. 



The American Museum has, through Dr. J. A. Allen, curator 

 of mammals, loaned me specimens of Blarina thomasi and B. squami- 

 pes for purposes of comparison and the U. S. National Museum a 

 .series of Sciurus hoffmanni. 



For this aid I would extend my sincere thanks especially to Mr. 

 Osgood, without whose co-operation this paper could not have been 

 prepared. 



Mr. Rhoads has kindly furnished me with some field notes on 

 Ccenolestes and other interesting species which are duly credited.

 Two specimens of this interesting fish-eating rodent were obtained

'1911, p. 493; 1913, p. 1.53.

5. Oryzomys minutns (Tomes). 



Hesperomi/s mimdus Tomes, Proe. Zool. Sor. London, 1.S60, p. 215. 

 (Ecuador.) 



The Hcsperomiiii minutuH of Tomes was based upon an immature 

 specimen obtained by Fraser, but without definite locality, although it 

 was supposed to be from Pallatanga. Oldfield Thomas, in describing 

 a new species of this genus from Peru {Ann. and Mag. A'at. Hist., 

 1894 (XIV), p. 357), identified with Tomes' type an adult specimen 

 in the British Museum which was also collected by Fraser at Palla- 

 tanga, December, 1858. Later (op. cit., 1898 (H), p. 267) he de- 

 scribed this specimen as new under the name Oryzomys dryas. His 

 ■e.xplanation of this action is that specimens received from Mr. 

 Soderstrom (localit\- not given) were obviously identical with Tomes' 

 type and different from the Pallatanga skin. 



Mr. Rhoads' five specimens were all obtained in the vicinity of 

 Hacienda Garzon (or Rosario) at the southern foot of Mt. Pichincha, 

 ^ome of them "in meadows and swamps below the house, 10,150 feet, " 

 ■others higher up near the paramo, 12,000 feet.

The Soderstrom specimens mentioned by Thomas doubtless came 

 from Pichincha, which is of ea.sy access from Quito, and probablj' 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



Tomes' type was also obtained there. While the latter is probably 

 not absolutely identifiable after this lapse of time, it seems best to 

 retain his name minutus for this form. The animal is a little smaller 

 than M^is musculiis and almost exactly the same color below, while 

 above it is very much more rustj- with a clearer line of demarcation 

 on the side. The ground color above, at the base of the tail where 

 it is purest and Ijrightest, is "tawny ochraceous" of Ridg^vay's Color 

 Standards 1912, but is duller and browner on the back and head and 

 thickly mixed everj^vhere ^\'ith black hairs. 



6. Eeithrodontomys soderstromi Thomas. 



Reilhrodordomy^ Sodtrslromi Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1898 (I), 

 p. 451. (Quito.) 



Four specimens obtained from Mr. Soderstrom, who collected 



them at or near Quito, and one obtained in Quito by Mr. Rhoads, 



April 25, ad. 9 , length 185 mm., tail 105, hind foot 20, ear 14.5. 



7. Phyllotis haggardl Thomsis. 



Fhyllotis Haggardi Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. HLst., 1898 (II), p. 270- 

 (Mt. Pichincha.) 



One immature female (12,697, Coll. A. N. S. Phila.) obtained at 

 Hacienda Garzon at the southern foot of Pichincha, at 12,000 feet, 

 nearly up to the paramo, ^lay 12, 1911. 



It agrees very well with Thomas' description, excepting that the 

 tail is only 50 mm. in length, whereas that of the type measured 

 86 mm. 



8. .Epeomys vnloani (ThomjisK 



.iipeoinys vulcani Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1898 (I), p. 452. 

 (Mt. Pichincha, 12,000 feet.) 



A partially mummified skin (12,698, Coll. A. N. S. Phila.) obtained 



from Mr. Soderstrom. collected on the west side of Mt. Pichincha. 



Thomas seems to have made a mistake in citing the tail as "barely 



as long as the head without the body," since a few lines below he 



gives length of "head and body 111 mm. and tail 84 mm." The 



measurements are probably correct as given, since our dried specimen 



is 100 mm. long exclusive of the tail which measures about 72 mm. 



9. Thomasomys paramorum Thomas. 



Thomasomys paramorum Thomas, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1898 (I), 

 p. 453. (Paramo, south of Chimborazo.) 



Ten specimens obtained on the paramo of Mt. Pichincha are 

 apparently referable to this species, obtained originally in a similar 

 region near Mt. Chimborazo. 



They are almost exactly like the much smaller Oryzomys minutus 

 in color, both abo^■e and below.

Mr. Rliuads secured a series of seven specimens of another Thnwn- 

 somys on the paramo of Mt. Pichincha apparently allied to 7'. 

 cinereuH Thomas, from Cutervo, Peru. .\s no such animal seems 

 to have been described from Ecuador, I propose to name it Thoma-

 Ecuador has brought to light so many interesting species of verte-

Skull similar to that of T. cinereus Thomas, but a little larger with 

 much wider interpterygoid fossa. Fur long anil soft. Brown tints 

 of upper parts nearly Instre of Ridgway's "Color Standards," but so 

 mingled with black hairs that the general appearance is very much 

 darker, nearly black on the back. The fur of the under parts is gray 

 with buffy tips, not whitish. The upper side of the hind feet is 

 clothed with dusky haiss down to the ba.se of the toes, while the 

 latter have scattered white hairs, notably at their extremities. The 

 fore feet are but scantily haired, while the hairs on the tail in no way 

 conceal the scales. The ears are well haired.

Mr. Osgood informs me that so far as he is aware all of the de- 

 scribed species approximating this in size have relatively shorter 

 tails, while the blackish back distinguishes it from all those species 

 available for comparison. 



"Several specimens of this mouse were secured above the Casa 

 ■Garzon, along the trail from that Hacienda to the summit of Mount 

 Pichincha. The elevation was a few hundred feet above the valley, 

 where the marsupial Ccenolestes was secured, approximately 10,500 feet 

 ^nd probably this is their lowest range, as much trapping was done 

 200 to 300 feet farther down without securing any. Their habitat 

 ■was on the rocky wooded slopes, where they had burrows similar 

 to those of our North American Microtine rodents, from one to 

 three inches below the surface of the soil and debris. 



" I was interested to notice, when skinning these mice, that all of 

 them, or possibly only the males, were supplied with a remarkable 

 prolongation of the anus, that organ being extended, or rather, 

 extensible, beyond the thighs for half an inch or more, as indicated 

 in the memoranda on the labels of the specimens. This prolongation 

 was not an internal extension, but external, being hairy throughout."

Nine specimens of this mouse were obtained on the paramo of 

 Pichincha or near Hacienda Garzon, a little lower down. 



Externally they are almost exactly like Thoniasomys paramorum, 

 averaging perhaps a little darker or duller, biit are easily recognized 

 by the shorter tail.

One specimen (12,725, Coll. A. X. S. Phila.), male, procured in the

 though no suitable material is available for comparison.

"Squirrels were reported by the natives to be in the forests about 

 Huigra from 4,000 feet and upwards, but we saw none until we 

 penetrated the Pagma forest above Hacienda Jalancay, 6,000 to 

 7,000 feet. They were exceetlingly rjire, however, even in this 

 forest. I saw one, after the specimen secured was taken, in an orange 

 grove near the Casa, 1,500 feet lower down. I can state nothing 

 about their habits, not having jiersonally observed them in life. 

 No other species of squirrels were ob.served in our wanderings."

These specimens no doubt represent S. a. chimbnnus Cabrera 

 (Trans. Mus. Cien. Nat. Madrid] Zool. Series, No. 9, 1913), but as 

 I am unable to appreciate the difference between the two forms and 

 have no typical material of either for comparison, I jjrefer to refer 

 the specimens to Thomas's S. andinus. 



"These cottontails were found, as we rose from the Chimbo River 

 valley up the slopes, 500 to 1,000 feet above the town of Chambo. 

 They f recfuented the brush-grown pastures in similar situations to those 

 frequented by our cottontails of the United States, only they kept more 

 closely to the bushes and were not found in the open pastures. They 

 seemed to range from that point no lower, but to reach up the slopes 

 into the paramo, at an elevation of 12,000 to 13,000 feet, but we 

 secured none in the paramo region, abundant as they evidently 

 were by their tracks and droppings in the thick tussock grass. We 

 also saw several on the paramo of Mount Pichincha, above Hacienda 

 Garzon, but were fated to secure no specimens. None were seen in 

 this locality below the paramo, viz., 11,000 feet, approximately. 

 It is quite possible that the paramo rabbit is distinct from the 

 animal of the templada, at least subspecifically, or that there are 

 two species, not di,stinguishable at a distance by a field observer."

While there is an earlier Mustela aurivenlcr Hodgs, 1841, which in 

 my opinion would invalidate Gray's name, yet it does not seem 

 desirable to propose a substitute until the relationship of the Ecuador 

 species to those described from Colombia and Peru is definitely 

 ■settletl. At present I am unable to secure any of the material 

 necessary for comparison. 



"The only weasel seen on the expedition was shot by Mr. Lenuuon,

Eight specimens of a Blarina were ol)tained at Hacienda Carzon 

 on Mt. Pichincha at an altitude of 10,500 ft. and on the paramo 

 1,500 ft. higher. Four of these were prepared as skins and tlie 

 other.-s preserved in spirits. 



So far as 1 am aware, no Blarina has previously been found south 

 •of Colombia {B. thojnasi Merriam and B. squamipes Allen) and Merida, 

 \'enezuela (M. meridensis Thomas) ; and as the Ecuador specimens 

 differ from all of these, I propose to'name them Blarina osijoodi for 

 Mr. W. II. Osgood, of the Field Museum of Natural History, whose 

 expeditions to South America have done so much to enrich our 

 knowledge of its mammals and birds.

I am not prepared to say how good a character the squamation 

 of the feet may prove to be, but B. osgoodi exhibits scaly plate.s on 

 the hind feet similar to, but smaller than, those of B. squamipes. 

 They abe not apparent on the fore feet nor on any of the feet of 

 B. thomasi which has the feet much more thickly haired than either 

 B. osgoodi or B. squamipes: 



In general size, color, and length of tail B. meriderisis and B. 

 squamipes appear to be very .similar, and it would be interesting to 

 know whether the former exhibits the marked squamation. 



"These shrews were first taken at the Hacienda Garzon on the 

 southern slope of Mount Pichincha, about on the level with the Casa. 

 They were trapped in runways aloi^g the banks of a deeply cut arti- 

 ficial ditch, the kind used in that country in lieu of a fence against 

 cattle. The location was wooded clearing and brush land, at that 

 point deeply shaded upland. The runways in location and character 

 were precisely like those made and used by Blarinas in the United 

 States." (S. X. Rhoads.)

Mr. Osgood has compared the Cayambe specimen with true 

 marsupialis of Guiana and Venezuela and finds but little difference 

 except that it is somewhat larger. It may'possibly be referable to 

 D. m. colombica Allen, type locality Santa Marta. 



19. Caenolestes fnliginosus (Tomes). 



^TEcuador"!"^'^""""' '^"""'''' ^'"'- ^°°'- ^°''- L°n^'°"' 1863, p. 51. 



Two female specimens of this little known marsupial were obtained 

 by Mr. Rhoads at Hacienda Garzon, near the paramo of Mt. Pichincha, 

 May 12, 1911, about three months after Mr. Osgood had rediscovered 

 the very closely allied C. obscurus on the Paramo de Tama on the 

 borderland of Colombia and ^'enezuela. 



So far as I am aware, no specunen of this interesting animal has 

 been obtained in Ecuador since the type was taken by Eraser about 




18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



1859 (see Tomes, P. Z. S., 1860, p. 213). Eraser's specimen was sup- 

 posed to have come from Pallatanga, but this was not certain as the 

 collection had been mixed up, and it is quite as likely, in view of 

 Mr. Rhoads' discovery, that ho got it on Mt. Pichincha. 



As given by Tomes in descril)ing the animal in 1863, the measure- 

 ments of the type (reduced to millimeters) are: head and body 97 mm., 

 tail 97, head 31. 



In his description of C. obficurus Thomas gives the measurements 

 as head and body 151, tail 144, hind foot 23, ear 12 x 11.5, and bases 

 the species as distinct from C. fuliginosus on the fact that it is " double 

 the size."

Total length 223 mm., head and body 107.0, tail vertebra; 115.4, 

 hind foot 22.5. 



It will be readily seen, therefore, that his specimens and those of 

 Mr. Rhoads are practically identical in measurements, while a com- 

 parison of the skins made by Mr. Osgood shows "no appreciable 

 difference." Unless it is maintaijied that there arc two species in 

 Ecuador, it looks very much as if C. obscurus Thomas might become a 

 synonym of C. fuliginosus Tomes. Such a view, involving the 

 assumption that Tomes' measurements were quite erroneous or that 

 his specimen was a young one, seems to me much more rational 

 than to suppose that two species of quite dififerentsize occur in Ecuador. 



" The two specimens were secured in swampy ground, the edge of a 

 large jia-sture on the Hacienda Garzon, within a few feet of a swiftly 

 flowing stream of considerable size. They were caught in small 

 cj'^clone mouse traps set in underground runways among the thick 

 grass, these runways being ai)out on the level with the waterline 

 of the swamp. They were caught on the same day, soon after 

 placing the traps in tliat locality, but although I continued to 

 trap there for a week longer, having as many as 40 or 50 traps in 

 that place, I secured no more specimens there, nor in any other 

 similar localities where trajiping was done. The stream alluded to

THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GENUS CYCLOPS IN THE VICINITY OF 

 HAVEEFORD, PENNSYLVANIA. 



BY REYNOLD A. SPAETH. 



TIk; orif^inal purpose of this paper was, after the notes and obser- 

 \'ations of t^vo year.s had been collected, to prove that by a careful 

 and regular study of the water from a single locality, many of the 

 forms of the Cyclopidce which are now considered rare would be 

 found to be quite abundant, at least at certain .seasons of the year. 

 Owing to unforeseen circumstances, this purpose had to be abandoned 

 in part, and although all the forms recorded in this paper have been 

 taken from a single small pond in the vicinity of Haverford College, 

 the records of monthly abundance or rarity of the different species 

 are not complete. Certain species, notably C. varicans, C. fimbriatiis 

 var. poppei, and C. phaleratus, appear far more abundantly in the 

 spring from the middle of March to the end of May. C. prasinus 

 I have found in the greatest numbers in September and early October 

 collections. C. albidus, C. viridis var. i'nsectus, and C. serrulatus do 

 not vary so noticeabl}'^ in the collections, while C. fuscus is the most 

 unvarying species of the genus, a few being found in the water taken 

 the year round. 



In his paper of '97, E. B. Forbes has made a most excellent revis- 

 ional study of the North American Cydopidcc. His work has sim- 

 plified investigation for all future workers in this field, and his very 

 careful anil excellent observations can hardly be overestimated. 

 I have followed his sy.stem of subgenera to avoid confusion. 



Cragin's paper of '83 has scarcely received due credit from the 

 investigators who have followed him. His drawings show con- 

 siderable accuracy of detail and very few of the important structural 

 features have escaped his notice. 



Marsh's work has been rather more of a plankton study than one 

 of individual structure. Brewer's paper of '98 lays considerable 

 emphasis on feet-armature, which is now generally considered a 

 variable feature and not a reliable character for specific distinction. 



Miss Byrnes' recent paper of '09 is somewhat confusing. Rather 

 unfortunately .she has reverted to Herrick's varietal names of C. 

 sigiHitus. has credited Forbes with both C. bicuspidatus Claus and 

 C. serrulatus Fischer in her list of species studied, and ha.s confused 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 21 



C. bicolor Sars with C. varicans Sars. Many of her drawings, however, 

 are excellent, and she has furthermore presented all figures on the* 

 same scale, which is of value in a comparative study of the species. 

 Her chief source of information has apparently been Herrick, whose 

 work, while remarkable, considering the number of species described, 

 is, owing to its large field, often misleading and at times quite incor- 

 rect. She has neglected both Schmeil and Forbes — the most com- 

 plete modern works on the sul)ject. Her most careful study has 

 been on 'the armatures of the four pairs of swimming feet, which, 

 while interesting in showing the variations that occur, are not 

 sufficiently constant characters to warrant a deduction of general 

 conclusions. 



E. B. Forbes was the first American investigator to lay much 

 stress on the importance of the shape of the receptaculum set^iinis. 

 He was convinced by Schmeil's work of '92 that it was the most 

 important character for specific distinction. Its shape, while often 

 somewhat obscure, varies very little, and the same general outline 

 is preserved in all members of the same species. This outline is 

 effected largel.y b.y the nuhiber of spermatozoa contained in the 

 receptaculum. Other important distinguishing characters are the 

 number of female antennal segments, the length of the first female 

 antennse, hyaline plates and sensory hairs and clulas, armature of 

 the stylets (variable in some species), and the shape and armature 

 of the fifth foot. 



The number of female antennal segments is usually quite constant. 

 Of the specimens from this locality, C. phalemtiis and C. varicans 

 were the only exceptions to the rule. The former may have either 

 ten or eleven joints and the latter eleven or twelve. In the plate of 

 C varicans I have shown only the eleven-jointed form of the first 

 antennae, as this seems to be a winter transitional stage, though such 

 individuals were all sexually mature. The twelve-jointed form did 

 not appear until the April collections. The length of the female 

 first antennse varies remarkably in C serrulatus, but in all species 

 having antennse of less than twelve segments, it is quite constant. 

 Hyaline plates vary very slightly as to their edges. Minute serra- 

 tions occasionally appear or are absent, notably in C. prasinus. 

 Sense-clubs anil hairs are constant features. 



The armature of the stylets and their proportions are constant in 

 some species, as C. modeslus, C. varicans, and C. phaleratus. In 

 others, as C. bicuspidatus and especially in C. sen-ulatus, the variation 

 is very great. 




22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Forbes considers the armature of the swinnning feet "of con- 

 siderable value in certain cases, and constant as a rule;" that "the 

 general character with regard to strength, etc., may usually be relied 

 upon; Init I have often seen in a single specimen al! the gradations 

 between spines and setae, and it would be impossible from this 

 character to say which of the two names should be applied." The 

 more I have worked out the armature of the swimming feet, the more 

 I am convinced that a constant standard cannot be obtained for 

 such an armature for all members of the same species. The following 

 table is an illustration of the confusing results obtained in attempting 

 to establish a standard swimming-feet armature for C. phalemtus. 



Case Number 1. 



First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setse; inner ramus, one 



spine, four setae. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, four setse: inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, four spines, five sctte; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, two setae. 



Case Number 2. 



First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four .^etae. 

 Second i)air — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, four .spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, two setae. 



Case Number 3. 



First pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



spine, four setae. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Fourth pair — (right) three spines, five setae: inner ramus, one seta, 



two sjjines, two setae. 

 Fourth pair — (left) four spines, four seta;; inner ramus, one seta, 



two spines, two setae. 



The above cases show a variation in both outer and inner ramus 

 of the first pair, in the outer ramus of the second pair, and the outer 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 23 



ramus of the fourth pair. The case of a spine becoming a seta as 

 in the outer ramus of the fourth foot of Number 3 right and Number 

 3 left is not as unusual as the appearance of an extra spine, as on the 

 outer ramus of the first pair of Number 3 compared with the cor- 

 responding ramus of 1 and 2. In some species the armature is 

 considerably more constant. In C. modestus, for example, it rarely 

 varies at all, specimens from widely separated localities showing an 

 iilentical arrangement of both spines and setiE. After the examina- 

 tion of 'a great many specimens of a number of species, I have con- 

 cluded that unless there are very distinct differences in some of the 

 other important distinguishing characters, a slight variation in 

 swimming-feet armature is not sufficient proof for establishing a new 

 species or even a variety. 



The fifth foot, both in armature and shape, is constant as a rule. 

 There are slight variations occasionally in the shape of the segments 

 and comparative lengths of spines and setae. In a single case I have 

 found a mature female of C. riridis var. insedus with an extra com- 

 pletely developed seta on the distal segments of both fifth feet. 

 This very unusual form is now in the collection of C. D. Marsh. 



The receptaculum seminis has already been mentioned. In pre- 

 serving specimens it is advisable to use a 1 per cent, solution of 

 formalin to avoid contraction and distortion of this organ. 



All of the plates have been drawn from life. The movements of 

 the living animals may be readily overcome by the use of a 1-1000 

 parts solution of chlorotone. This I have found to be very con- 

 venient and all danger of flattening and distorting the outline of 

 specimens may be thus avoided. By this method the same individual 

 may be repeatedly used, as the animal recovers a few moments after 

 having been replaced in fresh water. Care must be taken that the 

 solution of chlorotone does not become concentrated by evaporation, 

 in which case the animals are killed by its too violent effects. 



The work in this paper covers a period of three years. All of the 

 species described herein have been taken from a single pond of less 

 than one acre area. The Copepoda having been largely neglected 

 in this part of the country, it is interesting to note the presence of 

 some of the more unusual forms, as C. varicans, C. fimbriatus var. 

 poppei, and several others. I am greatly indebted to Dr. C. D. 

 Marsh for his identification of specimens and his general interest and 

 assistance throughout the period of study. My thanks are also due 

 Mr. E. B. Forbes and Dr. H. S. Pratt. The latter, through his 

 unfailing personal interest and encouragement and by placing the

very best of the laboratory equipment at my disposal, is largely 

 responsible for the existence of this paper. I gladly take this oppor- 

 tunity to acknowledge also the assistance of Mr. J. Ashbrook in 

 collecting material.

Synonymy and Distribution. — In his discussion of the synonymy 

 of this very variable and widely distributed species, Forbes has 

 cleared up the question of C. thomasi Forbes, C. navies Herrick, 

 C. ■minnilus Forbes, and C. serratus Forbes = C'. forbesi Herrick. He 

 finds, after a careful comparative study, that they should all be 

 considered as slight variations of the type C. bicuspidatus, V)ut the 

 differences are not sufficient to warrant the varietal names. Schmeil 

 has also discussed the question at great length. He does not consider 

 C. thomasi Forbes nor C. navus Herrick of specific value, since the 

 latter is only a variety of C. thomasi Forbes. Brewer has d(scril)etl, 

 as C. navus Herrick and C. pulchellus Koch, two species of cyclops 

 from the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska. His descriptions of the 

 rudimentary and swimming feet show that he was dealing with 

 slightly different specimens of C. bicuspidatus Claus. As C. pul- 

 chellus Herrick and C. bicuspidatus Forbes, IMiss Byrnes has described 

 examples of ('. bicuspidatus Claus from Long Island. Her descrip- 

 tions of the swimming feet and her drawings of the receptaculum 

 seminis show very conclusively that the two forms both belong under 

 this .specific name. The variation of the single seta on the fifth 

 foot is frequently encountered in the species. The form of the fifth 

 foot in what she describes as C. hlcus])ldatus Forbes is very interesting, 

 for Forbes has found it but once and on that occasion from Wooils 

 Hole, Mass. It corresponds exactly with the European forms and 

 with the representatives of this sjx'cies from this locality. 



C. bicuspidatus Claus is very widely distributed over the United 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 25- 



States. Forbes states that "it has been fountl in Mas.sachusett.-; 

 and Wyoming and in all the intervening territory, " and further that 

 "it is the commonest Cyclops in the Great Lakes." Miss Byrnes 

 has recently found it to be a coimnon form in the Long Island waters. 

 I have noted that it occurs very abundantly in one of the large 

 streams in this vicinity, l)ut in the small pond from which I have, 

 taken every other species described in this paper I have found but a 

 single specimen.' 



Specific Description. — In the specimens of C. bicuspidatiis Claus 

 from this vicinity, the lateral angles of the cephalothorax are very 

 prominent, as in the "specimens from the far west" (Forbes). The 

 first thoracic segment is a little more than half the length of the 

 entire cephalothorax (PI. II, fig. 1); The posterior borders of all 

 the thoracic segments are smooth. 



The first abdominal segment (PI. II, figs. 1 and 5) is unusually 

 expanded, laterally, on the anterior side of the suture. It is about 

 as long as the remaining three abdominal segments. The posterior 

 margins of the first three abdominal segments are finely serrated 

 (PI. II, fig. 5). The fourth .segment has the usual row of spinules 

 on its posterior margin (PI. II, figs. 1 and 2). 



The stylets (PI. II, fig. 2) are more than twice as long as the last 

 two abdominal segments. Their length is about six times their 

 width ami they are frequently slightly out-curved. The above 

 proportions hold good only in the cases of the specimens examined. 

 They vary considerably in different localities. The lateral spine is 

 inserted at the beginning of the posterior third of the ramus, and at 

 a distance of aliout one-quarter of the length of the stylet from its 

 insertion point there is always present a minute lateral coml) of 

 spinules (PI. II, fig. 2). Of the apical sets, the outermost is heavy, 

 finely plumose, and about as long as the delicate inner seta. The 

 longer of the two prominently developed setae is atiout equal in 

 length to the abdomen and twice that of the shorter seta. The\- 

 are both delicately plmnose. 



The first antennae of the female (PI. II, fig. 1) are seventeen- 

 jointed and terminate at the end of the first thoracic segment. At 

 the distal end of the twelfth segment there is borne an unusually 

 long, spear-shaped sense-club (PI. II, fig. 3). The setse are all quite 

 short and plumose for the most part. The terminal segments bear 



1 In late March and April, 1910, collections in the vicinity of Cambridge, 

 Mass., this was by far the most abundant form. 




26 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



no hyaline plates and the last three gradually increase in length to 

 the end. 



The armature of the swimming feet is as follows : 



First pair — outer ramus, two spines, four sets; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four sets. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, three spines, four setee; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setse. 

 Third pair — like second. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, four sets; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, two setae. 



The fifth foot (PI. II, fig. 4) is two-segmented, the basal .segment 

 being about as long as broad and bearing a plumose seta on its outer 

 distal angle. The distal segment is cylindrical, about twice as long 

 as wide, and bears a long plumose seta and a short, thick spine. 

 For this spine is often substituted a longer seta-like form, though 

 that is not the regular armature in the local specimens. 



The receptaculum seminis (PI. II, fig. 5) consists of two divisions. 

 The anterior portion extends as a low arch across the segment. The 

 posterior division is bag-shaped and reaches a point half-way to the 

 l^osterior margin of the first aladominal segment. Its anterior border 

 branches out abruptl.v on either side along the suture. The porus 

 is situated on the median line, between the lateral angles on the 

 suture. 



The egg-sacs are unusually large and are carried at a considerable 

 angle from the body. Forbes gives the size of this species as 1-1.4 

 mm. Schmcil gives 1..3-2 mm. for the European forms. The 

 specimens from this locality average about l.r> nun. 



The color of C. bicuspidaius is generally a very pale shade of 

 yellow. Often individuals appear to bo quite colorless. The tlorsal 

 surface of the thorax, especially the anterior portion, usually has a 

 peculiarly shiny appearance. 



Tlie last characters for the distinction of this species are its slim 

 form, the shajie of the fifth feet and the receptaculum seminis, and 

 especially the small lateral combs of spinules on the outer sides of 

 the stylets.

Synonymy and Distribution. — In his discus.sion of the differences 

 between this species and the closely related Cyclops albidus Jurine, 

 Dr. Schmeil has proven not only that we are dealing with two 

 distinct species, but also that Jurine was the first investigator to 

 ■distinguish these two. It is only right, then, that Jurine's names 

 should stand and that Koch's Cyclops signatus give way to (1) C. 

 Juscus and (2).f . albidus Jurine. In spite of Sehmeil's careful proof, 

 several of our American investigators have clung to Herrick's varieties 

 ienuicomis and coronatus of C. signatus Koch. C. D. Marsh accepted 

 Sehmeil's proof in his paper of '95. Even after the publication of 

 Forbes' paper of '97, in which he abandoned Herrick's terms for 

 those of Jurine, Brewer in '98 and Miss Byrnes in '06 and again in 

 '09, have reverted to Herrick's varietal names. 



In speaking of the "two varieties," coronatus and tenuicornis, 

 Brewer states that "the real differences between them are confined 

 to the seventeenth joint of the antenna and the caudal setae." He 

 then continues: "The difference between their first cephalothoracic 

 segments and their furcse is hardly distinguishable." On p. 1.36 of 

 Sehmeil's monograph there is a table of "the most important dis- 

 tinguishing characters" of the two species in question. Of the 

 eleven "important characters" mentioned, Brewer has noted four, 

 and no mention is made of such important features as the receptacu- 

 luni setninis and the sense-club (present or absent) on the twelfth 

 antennal segment. 



It is quite evident that Miss Byrnes has overlooked the more 

 important distinguishing differences between the two species. In 

 Jier recent paper. The Fresh Water Cyclops of Long Island ('09), 

 in spite of the carefully tabulated proofs of Schmeil in Germany 

 and the acceptance of his views by both Marsh ('9.5) and Forbes 

 ('97), Miss Byrnes has clung to the obsolete name of C. signatus 

 Koch and attempts to revive Herrick's varietal name coronatus and 

 Kichard's(?) annulicornis. In a foot-note (on p. 9) she states : 

 " I have used the more recent name C. signatus var. coronatus instead 

 of the older name ('. fuscus Jurine, because it expresses more clearly 

 the evidently close relationship that exists between C. signatus var. 




28 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



coronatus and the allied form C. signatus var. a?uudicornis, called 

 C. albidus by Jurine. " 



It is quite evident that Miss BjTnes has not had Dr. Schmeil's 

 exhaustive work on the Cijclopidx of Germany at hantl. He has 

 shown conclusively (129, 130 and 137-140) that by right of priority 

 Jurine's names should stand. Xo matter how "close" the "relation- 

 ship" between the two forms in question, Miss Byrnes is hardly 

 justified in using "the more recent" name. In her description of 

 Cyclops signatus var. coronatus (p. 9) she states that this form has 

 "serrations in the hj-aline plate on the two distal segments of the 

 antennae" and, furthermore, that "the notches in the hyaline plate 

 of the antennte form gradually and maj' or may not be present. 

 In fig. 4 they are seen on the last segment only. " The first statement 

 I am unable to verify, nor do any of the investigators mention a 

 serration of the "two distal segments of the antennae." They are 

 always present in the hyaline plate of the distal segment in adult 

 forms. In the imiyature forms the plate on the distal segment of 

 the antennae is often exactly as in C. albidus Jurine. The serrations 

 do not "form gradually." I have .several times observed a youn<>- 

 specimen of C. fuscus just before the last ecdysis. In such ca^e< 

 there was a finely serrated hyaline plate on the last segment, but the 

 coarsely serrated [)late of the adult form could be distinctly oliserved 

 below the transpar3nt chitin folded Hat down alon^ the segment. 

 In every case the serrations of the coming plate were complete. 

 In her conclusion Miss Byrnes states that "there are wide ranges 

 of variability in the reduced seta on the inner ramus of the fourth 

 foot of annulicornis and in the hyaline plate of the antenme of both 

 varieties — in short, in the most important differential charact?rs 

 of the two varieties." It is not at all surprising that Miss Byrnes 

 considers the "two varieties" so closely related when we find that 

 half of (to her) the "most important differential characters" are 

 concerned with a single seta on the inner ramus of the fourth foot. 

 In her description of this species, as well as all the other.s described 

 by her. Miss Byrnes obviously neither considers the receptacuban 

 seminis a most important feature, nor does she mention the presence 

 of sense-club or hair in a single species. 



Miss liyrnes has added very little to the evidence of the close rela- 

 tion that may exist between these two species. She gives but one- 

 quarter of the observations in Herrick's "diagnosis," which is 

 inci)niplete even in its full form, and "then draws her conclusion 

 mainly from her own notes on the differen-e in the single seta of the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 29 



inner ramus of the fourth foot, already mentioned. I quote from 

 her paper once more. "He (Herrick) state; that the two varieties 

 have similar armature of the swimming feet, but that tenuicornis 

 differs from coronatus in the absence of serrations on the antennal 

 lamellae and in the divarication of the ovisac.?." Here follows the 

 original description of Herrick's "Cyclops signatus var. tenuicornis. 

 First segment of thorax shorter, its length to that of the entire thorax 

 as 1 : 1.9. Last segment of antenniE with unserrated lamella. 

 Caudal stylets longer, length to width as 2.1 : 1, inner aspect not 

 ciliatetl. Outer apical seta half as long as inner. Second segment 

 of antcnnules longer. Color variable, but always banded or 

 splotched. It is also generally true that the ovisacs in the present 

 variety are more strongly divaricate- than in the variety coronatus." 

 Miss Byrnes now concludes that since "the antennal lamella of 

 annulicornis sometimes bears serrations and coronatus sometimes 

 bears its egg masses in a divaricate position, as I have found in 

 attempting to distinguish the two forms by this character, .... 

 consequently Herrick's diagnosis is untenable." This gives Herrick 

 absolutelj' no credit for six of his eight points of difference noted. 

 Herrick's diagnosis should not be considered untenable, but merely 

 incomplete. 



This species, while not as common as Cyclops albidus, ajDpears to 

 be quite generally distributed over the United States. Forbes 

 reports it from the "ponds and lakes of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, 

 and Massachusetts," where it "occurs sparingly." Brewer found 

 it with C. albidus Jurine ( = C. signatus var. tenuicornis Herrick) in 

 the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska, but "always in small numbers." 

 Miss Byrnes has studied the species at Cold Spring Harbor, Long 

 Island. Kofoid does not mention it in his studies of the "Plankton 

 of the Illinois River." I have found it in this locality; rather more 

 abundantly in September, October, and April than during the winter 

 months. I have never found it in very great numbers. During 

 the summer and fall of 1909, it occurred sparingly in collections 

 from Lake Winnepesaukee, N. H., and in a small pond adjoining 

 "Fresh Pond" at Cambridge, Mass. 



Specific Description. — The cephalothorax (PI. I, fig. 1) in this spe- 

 cies is a little more than twice as long as the abdomen. They are to 

 each other as 21 : 10. The first segment is to the entire cephalothorax 

 as 7 : 11. The length of the thorax to its width is as 11: 6. In the 

 living animal none of the lateral angles of the thoracic segments are 

 prominent. The posterior borders of the thoracic segments are all 




30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.VDEMY OF [Jan.> 



unserrated. The fifth segment has a row of minute chitinous teeth 

 extending transversely across the ventral side between the fifth feet. 

 This same segment has on its lateral sides a row of fine spinules as 

 well as a minute fringe of hairs, as in C. prasinus. 



The abdomen tapers but little towards its posterior end. The 

 first segment is about as long as the three following ones. The po.s- 

 terior edges of the first three abdominal segments are smooth. 

 Occasionally there are very slight and uneven serrations present 

 (PI. I, fig. 3). The ventral posterior border of the fourth segment 

 has a prominent fringe of spines which do not extend to the edge of 

 the anal opening, as is the case in C. albidus. I find no mention of 

 this characteristic in any descriptions of C. fuscus that I have at hand. 



The stylets (PI. I, fig. 3) are short; the branches often slightly 

 out-curved. The length is three times the width. Schmeil states 

 that the inner border is "densely" set with hairs. In the specimens 

 from this localitj- these hairs are often very irregular, rarely "dense," 

 but always present. The apical setse are well developed and densely 

 plumose. The outer is to the inner as 4 : 7. The longest is to the 

 next in length as 7 : 5. 



The first antenniE of the female (PI. I, figs. 1 and 9) reach to the 

 anterior border of the first abdominal segment. They are seventeen- 

 jointed and bear a minute sensory hair upon the twelfth segment 

 in place of the sense-club found in C. albidus (PI. I, fig. 9). On 

 their anterior edges at the point of juncture with the following seg- 

 ments, the eightli, ninth, tenth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth 

 segments are ornamented with a row of prominent, obliciuely set 

 spinules. These rows of spinules form almost a quarter circle on 

 the eighth, ninth, and tenth segments. On the twelfth and thirteenth 

 segments they are not so closely set and are fewer in number. It is 

 interesting to note that where Schmeil found six spinules on these 

 segments in European forms, I have found but four or five, and on 

 the fourteenth segment where he records four, I iuive noted five in 

 every case. I have never seen more than seven of these spinules 

 on the eighth, ninth and tenth segments, and the eighth and tenth 

 usually have but five. Besides these regular rows of spinules, there 

 are smaller transverse and longitudinal rows and irregular groups of 

 verj- minute spinules (PI. 1, fig. 9) on the ventral side of the first 

 fourteen antennal segments. The longitudinal rows mark the 

 boundary between the .smooth portion of the segment and that on 

 which tlie spinules occur. 



The three terminal segments bear transparent hyaline plates. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 31 



These plates are smooth on the fifteenth and sixteenth segments, 

 but on the seventeenth (PL I, fig. 7) the plate is coarsely serrate 

 from the base of the segment to the insertion point of the middle 

 seta; from thence to the end minutely serrated as in C. alhidus. 

 This plate projects somewhat beyond the end of the seventeenth 

 segment. 



The second antennse (PI. I, fig. 5) are unusually long. The third 

 segment is the longest of the four— a distinguishing difference between 

 this and the following form. The swimming feet are armed as follows : 



■First pair — outer ramus, four spines, four setee; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setse. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Third pair — like second. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, 



three spines, two setae. 



Marsh has noted that "the larger of the two terminal spines of the 

 endopodite of the fourth foot, instead of being serrated on its edges 

 as is customary in all the spines of the swimming feet, is beset on its 

 inner margin with long, rather irregular teeth. " I find this character 

 present in the local specimens, though the "irregvilar teeth" do not 

 extend to the tip of the spine on its inner margin. There are but 

 five or six of these long serrations at the middle of the inner margin, 

 thence to the tip of the spine the serrations are normal. Schmeil 

 notes that the lamella which connects the basal segments of the 

 fourth pair of swimming feet is ornamented by a fringe of long hairs. 

 This is found also in C. alhidus, and is therefore hardly a distinctive 

 character of C. fuscus. In all the specimens that I have examined, 

 these "hairs" are very coarse, resembling rather long serrations. 

 There is a very noticeable characteristic in the lamella between the 

 basal joints of the third pair of swimming feet. There are two very 

 minute rows of blunt spinules extending transversely across the 

 lamella. The upper row is broken in the middle. In the following 

 species this character is very different. 



The fifth foot is practically identical with that of the following 

 species. Miss Byrnes states that the basal segment of the rudiment- 

 ary fifth foot in "coronatus" (= C. fuscus) is conspicuously short. 

 Schmeil fintls no such difference. Among all the representatives 

 of C. fuscus that I have compared with C. albidus, I have found 

 only very slight differences in the lengths of the basal segments of 

 the fifth feet. The apparent difference in length may pften be 




32 PROCEEOraGS OF THE ACADEMY OP [Jan., 



accDuntcil for by the strongly arched cephalothorax of C. albidus, 

 which enables the animal to place the fifth feet close upon the first 

 abdominal segment. In C. fuscus the shorter basal segment is 

 frequently only a foreshortening because of the angle at which the 

 feet are held. The arrangement of the spinules, the spines and the 

 setae are exactly as in C. albidus (PI. I, fig. 13). 



The receptaculum seminis (PI. I, fig. 11) consists of two main 

 divisions. The anterior portion is wide, shaped very much like the 

 corresponding portion of the receptaculum in C. albidus, but with a 

 very distinct indentation on its anterior border. The posterior 

 l)art appears as a pair of slightly elongated reniform divisions sepa- 

 rated by a median line and fusing at the porus. The color of the 

 reccptaculuui is always a deep reddish-brown which frequently makes 

 it difficult to distinguish its outline. 



The egg-sacs are carried very close to the abdomen. The eggs 

 are dark; in the living animal they look quite black, but in reality 

 they are a deep shade of brown. This applies only to freshly de- 

 posited eggs, as all Cyclops eggs from which the young arc about to 

 rincrgo show a characteristic salmon tinge due to the color of the 

 bodies of the nauplius. 



The length of the female varies but little. The following five 

 measurements give an approximate average for C. fuscus from_this 

 locality. All measurements include the caudal setae. 



No. 1 3.75 mm. 



No. 2 3.2 mm. 



No. 3 3.4 mm. 



No. 4 3.4 mm. 



No. 5 3.58 mm. 



Average 3.46 mm. 



Schmeil gives 3.4 mm. Brewer's figures are much smaller — 1.4 mm.- 

 1.8 nun. The males are often only half as long as the females. An 

 average length is 1.75 mm. 



The color of the fir.st four thoracic segments and the abdomen 

 from the posterior half of the first segment to the furca is usually a 

 dark green. The fifth thoracic segment, the stylets, and the fourth, 

 fifth, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth segments of the first antennae 

 are Ijlue. The anterior half of the first abdominal segment is reddish- 

 brown. Occasionally there are irregular blotches and streaks of 

 blue on the posterior borders of the first four thoracic segments. 

 The remaining segments are a dirty yellow color, deeper on the 

 anterior border.

C. fusats may be readily distinguished from all other members 

 of the genus by its size, dark color, and closely lying dark egg-sacs. 

 The absence of the sense-club of the twelfth antennal segment, the 

 coarsely serrated hyaline plate of the seventeenth antennal segment, 

 the form of the receptaculmn seminis. and the ciliated inner border 

 of the stylets are the most easily distinguishal^le characteristics of 

 this species. In order to simplify the comparison of C. fuscus with 

 C. albidus, I have arranged the following tabulated form for the 

 characters of the two species: 



Schmeil notes differences in the form of the spermatozoa and 

 their position in the spermatophore. The twelve points of difference 

 noted above should enable anyone to distinguish the two forms 

 positively.

Specific Description. — The first segment of the strongly arched 

 elHptical cephalothorax (PI. I, fig. 2), is in the proportion of 3 : 4 

 compared with the entire length of the cephalothorax. The lateral 

 angles of the segments are not prominent. The fifth segment is 

 rarely visible from above, owing to the arched form of the cephalo- 

 thorax. The fir.st three segments are smooth along their posterior 

 borders. I find in all of the specimens examined from this locality 

 that the fourth segment has on its posterior border, laterally and 

 not extending to the median line, a row of very minute chitinous 

 serrations. These are only visible when the animal is turned on its 

 side. I find no mention of these serrations in any of the descriptions 

 of this s])ecies to which I have access. The fifth segment bears, 

 dorsally .situated, three transverse rows of spinulos. The last of 

 these is the only complete one and borders the segment posteriorly. 

 The second row does not extend to the median line. The first row 

 is ciuite short, lateral in position, and the spinules are considerably 

 larger than in the other two. Sciimeil states in his note number 

 three, p. 130, that, with two exceptions, these rows of spinules have 

 "never been ob.served." In Cragin's paper of '83 in his description 

 of Cyclopn (cnuicornis Claus {= Cyclops albidus Jurine), he says: 

 "Either side of the fifth thoracic segment is furnished with three 

 transverse rows of serrulations, of which the posterior one is mar- 

 ginal." Furthermore, he illustrates the point in his PI. II, fig. 13. 

 His drawing is inconsistent, however, ^\^th his description, as it doe- 

 not show the marginal row extending the entire width of the segment. 

 Forbes, very properly, does not mention the row of blunt spinules 

 between the insertion points of the fifth feet. This is not a "char- 

 acteristic," as it is found in Cyclops fuscus Jurine. 



The width of the cephalothorax is to its length as 1 : 2. Its 

 length to that of the abdomen is as 7 : 4. (Schmeil rever.-sps these 

 figures and gives abd. : ceph. : : 9 : 5, obviously an oversight). 



The aiidomen is heavy; the first segment tapers only slightly, 

 but the enlargement at the anterior end extends beyond the width 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 35 



of the last thoracic segment. The second and third segments are 

 cylindrical and their posterior margins are very slightly and unevenly 

 serrated, largely on the under side. The fourth segment has the 

 usual fringe of spines on its posterior edge, and tapers suddenly to 

 the insertion point of the stylets. The stylets (PI. I, fig. 4) are 

 short, but slightly divergent and smooth on their inner sides. This 

 is an important character which Forbes does not note in his descrip- 

 tion. The proportion of the length to the breadth of each ramus 

 is 3 : 1 . There are four well-developed apical bristles. The longest 

 is to the second in length as 7 : 5; the outer to the inner as 1 : 3. 

 They are all plumose, but not as densely so as in Cyclops fuscus 

 Jurine. 



The first antennae vary very little in length. In the female they 

 usually reach to the middle or posterior border of the last thoracic 

 segment. They are seventeen-jointed, the terminal joints attenuated, 

 the last three being each armed Avith an hyaline plate. The edges 

 of these plates on the fifteenth and sixteenth segments are for the 

 most part entire, but I have repeatedly seen them, especially at the 

 base of the fifteenth segmental plate, minutely serrated. More 

 rarely these serrations extend along the entire edges of all three 

 plates. The plate of the last segment is always finely serrated on 

 its distal half. The point where these serrations, cease and the 

 smooth edge begins is sharply defined by a much deeper notch or 

 indentation (see PI. I, fig. 8). The twelfth segment bears a well- 

 developed sense-club (PI. I, fig. 10). Its length is about equal to 

 that of the thirteenth segment. All of the segments, except the 

 three terminal ones, bear an irregularly broken, longitudinal row of 

 minute spinules on their under side. The eighth, ninth, tenth, 

 twelfth and thirteenth segments have each a short row of small 

 cone-shaped serrations at the point of juncture with the following 

 segments, as in Cyclops fuscus. The twelfth segment (PI. I, fig. 10) 

 has, in addition, several (usually two) rows of smaller spinules 

 extending parallel to the marginal semicircular row. 



Mar.sh ('95) failed to find these "cro\ATis of spines" on the antennae 

 of "a large number of mature females" of C. albidns which he 

 "examined with great care." He concludes that this peculiar 

 character "seems to be rarely true in our forms." Forbes has 

 found it in the specimens examined by him from many parts of the 

 country. I have never failed to find it in the local specimens. 



The third segment of the second antennae (PI. I, fig. 6) is short 

 and somewhat pear-shaped. The armature of the swimming feet is 

 as follows: 




36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



First pair — outer ramus, four spines, four setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four sets. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setse; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setse. 

 Third pair — like second. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setse; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines (inner smooth-edged), two setse (distal one 



reduced) (see PI. I, fig. 14). 



The lower row of spinules on the lamella connecting the basal 

 segments of the third pair of swimming feet is verj' large and well 

 developed (about twelve coarse spinules). 



The fifth foot (PI. I, fig. 13) is essentially like that of C. fuscus 

 Jurine. Lilljeborg, in his PI. Ill, fig. 21, shows the fifth foot differing 

 from that of C. fuscus (fig. 13) on the same plate by the absence of 

 the rows of spinules on the two segments. The fifth foot consists 

 of two segments. The basal segment is slightly convex on its outer 

 margin, while the inner margin is correspondingly concave (see 

 PI. I, fig. 13). Toward the inner lateral surface of this same segment 

 there are several, usually three, rows of well-developed spinules. 

 At the outer distal corner it bears a long seta, plumo.se on its distal 

 half. The distal segment is set well towards the inner side of the 

 lower segment and at the point of juncture is ornamented with a 

 f circle of small spines. It bears on its tip two heavy spines and a 

 slender seta. The inner spine is slightlj^ longer than the outer. 

 At its base there is a semicircle of quite prominent spinules. Both 

 of these spines are more densely plumose on their inner edges. Be- 

 tween them and borne at the end of a truncated cone-shaped projec- 

 tion is the long middle seta. It is only slightly plumose at its distal 

 end, and these hairs (8-10 on each side) are placed at regularly 

 diminishing intervals. 



The shape of the receptaculum seminis (PI. I, fig. 12) can he readily 

 noted. The anterior division is almost elliptical when fully dis- 

 tended. The posterior portion is two-lobed and has the form of a 

 low, widely spread letter w. This organ is practically colorless, and 

 for this reason its form can be unmistakably observed. 



The egg-sacs (PI. I, fig. 2), carried at a considerable angle from the 

 alxlonien, are nearly as long as the abdomen. In a 9 in which the 

 alxlomen measured .6 mm. the egg-sacs were .57 mm. long. 



In discussing the size of this species, Forbes states that "the 

 usual length of the female in America is from 1.2(3-1.4 mm., but it 

 seems to be much greater (2. ."3 nun.) in the European representatives 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 37 



of this species." It is interesting to note the measurement of the 

 f ollo\ving five females taken at random : 



No. 1 2.5 mm. 



No. 2 2.51 mm. 



No. 3 2.21 mm. 



No. 4 2.50 mm. 



No. 5 2.47 mm. 



This gives an average measurement of 2.43 mn^. for representatives 

 of the species from this locaHty — less than .1 mm. difference in size 

 from European forms. Taking Forbes' figures and the above 

 together, we get an average measurement of 1.88 mm. 



The color, a blue-gray, occasionally nearly black, is most prominent 

 in the stylets and last abdominal segment, the second, third, first 

 half of the fourth, ninth and tenth segments of the first antennse 

 ( 9 ) and in irregular transverse bands, usually four, on the oephalo- 

 thorax. The remaining portions of the animal are nearly colorless 

 or a pale shade of yellow, though I have. frequently noted individuals 

 in which they were a bright blue-green. 



The species seems to be one of the commonest not only in America, 

 but all over the world. Forbes found it " in all localities examined. " 

 In nearly all the lists of crustaceans to which I have access it is 

 recorded as a common but rarely abundant variety. 



Kofoid records it as "numerically the least imi)ortant of the 

 dominant members of the genus in our plankton" (Illinois River). 

 I have found it to be one of the commonest of the Cijdopidce. 



Miss Walker has studied the species in Todd's Pond, Oregon, 

 where she found it to be, with Cyclops serrulatus, second in abundance 

 after Cijdops prasiyius. 



In collections made during the summer of 1909, at Lake Winne- 

 jiesaukee and in the vicinity of Cambridge, Mass., in March and 

 April, 1910, C. albidus was a common but not an abundant fomi.

Specific Description. — The shape of the cepKalothorax is very 

 characteristic in this species (P). II, fig. 6). The first segment reaches 




38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



its maximum width considerably in front of the posterior border, 

 and the anterior border line is somewhat straight er than usual, 

 resembling C. prasinus in this respect. This segment is to the 

 entire thora.x as 5 : 8. The fourth segment is regularly, semicircu- 

 larly excavate on its posterior margin. Forbes finds the posterior 

 edges of the first three segments irregularly notched, but the fourth 

 smooth. I am unable to verify this observation' all the thoracic 

 segments of specimens examined by me had smooth posterior edges. 

 The thorax is about twice as long as wide and one-third as long again 

 as the abdomen. 



In the male the cephalothorax (PI. 11, fig. 7) tapers only a very 

 little. The first segment is distinctly concave on its anterior border. 

 It expand- abruptly in its anterior third, but its middle does not 

 attain the width of the preceding thoracic segment. The first three 

 segments have smooth or faintly uneven posterior margins. The 

 last segment Forlies notes to be "peculiar in lacking the u-^ual fringe 

 of spines on the posterior edge." I have noted on either side of the 

 anal opening peculiar, out-curving, hook-like projection-^ of the 

 chitin (PI. II, fig. 8) on the posterior border of the fourth abdominal 

 segment. Otherwise its edge is smooth. It is interesting to note 

 thit half-way between the anterior border of the anal opening and 

 the posterior margin of the third abdominal segment there are 

 I)resent in this, as in all the Cyclopidx, two peculiar button-like 

 projections whose function may be sensory (PI. II, fig. 8). 



The stylets (PI. II, fig. 8) are rather slim an 1 abjut twice as long 

 as the fourth abdominal segment. Their length is four times their 

 width. The lateral spine is inserted slightly beyond the middle of 

 each ramu< and from this point half-way to the posterior margin 

 of the stylets, they are in the female peculiarly excavate. Along 

 the curving line that marks this character there is a very minute 

 row of spinules. The outer apical seta is rather short and finely 

 plumose. The other three apical set£E are all well developed. The 

 outer is to the inner as 4 : 3. The middle is the longest and is to the 

 next in length as 3 : 2. Though Forbes has shown the inner borders 

 of the stylets to t)e densely and coarsely plumose in his fig. 4 of 

 PI. XV, he fails to mention this character in his des(*ription. I have 

 never seen a specimen of C. modestus with the stylets as densely 

 plumose as he shows them to be. All of the specimens examined 

 from this locality showed very fine and often unevenly distributed 

 hairs on the inner surfaces of the stylets (PI. II, fig. 8). They are 

 only visible under a high power. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 39 



The female first antennse consist of sixteen segments. Herrick 

 notes a similar form with seventeen joints, but this again I am unable 

 to verify. They extend a little beyond the posterior margin of the 

 first thoracic segment. The second, third, tenth, and thirteenth 

 segments bear unusually long, heavy, plumose setse. In the males 

 these spines, which correspond to those of the third segment in the 

 female antennae, are verj^ conspicuous (PI II, fig. 7). When the 

 first antennse are folded under the body they protrude as shown in 

 the figure. This also occurs when the female aiueuiia^ are folded 

 uniler the cephalothorax. The female antennae show an unusual 

 change of direction between the third and fourth segments, giving 

 the animal a characteristic appearance and making the females 

 resemble the males to the naked eye. ■ On the fourteenth and fifteenth 

 segments of the first female antennse occur several characters that 

 may be sensory in function. The fourteenth segment bears a minute 

 sensory hair and a very inconspicuous, transparent, hj'aline plate 

 that contains about twelve coarse serrations (PI. II, fig. 11). The 

 fifteenth segment bears a smooth-edged hyaline plate of which the 

 distal end is club-shaped and protrudes considerably beyond the 

 anterior end of the segment. Forbes ('97) indicated the position 

 of this plate in his fig. 1, PI. XYI, of the first female antenuis, but he 

 seems to have overlooked the character of the organ. In the figure, 

 the positions of the large setae of the fourteenth and fifteenth segments 

 are indicated. 



The armature of the three segmented swimming feet is very 

 constant. The setae and the apical spines are long and slender. 

 Forbes notes that "the distal segments of the third and fourth pairs 

 of legs turn inward in a way peculiar to this species." The inner 

 border of the distal segment of the inner ramus of all four pairs is 

 finely plumose. The feet armature is as follows: 



First pair — outer ramus, four spines, four setae; inner ramus, six 



setae. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, six 



setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, six 



setae. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, two setae. 



The lamellae connecting the swimming feet have a peculiar form. 

 PI. II, fig. 10, shows this feature in the third pair.' In the fourth pair 

 the place of the seta on the basal joint is taken by a short chitinous 




40 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



point. The lamella of the second pair is similar to that of the third, 

 while in the first pair the chitin points have become quite roundeti 

 and smooth. 



The fifth foot (PI. II, fig. 9) is generally considered as having three 

 joints. Forbes states that it "has three freely movable segments, 

 though the basal one is small." Miss Byrnes simply states that 

 "the fifth foot is very distinctly three-jointed, and not 'ob.scurely' as 

 Herrick observed. " The basal segment is certainly very short, 

 though its presence is no longer a matter of conjecture. Whether 

 it is "freely movable" I am unable to say. The second segment 

 is almost square and bears a short seta on its outer side. Thej- are 

 both plumose and the larger is borne at the end of a slight projection 

 of the segment. The shorter of these seta- is usually folded untler the 

 longer, as shown in the figure. The rudimentary feet in this species 

 are unusually large. 



The recrptaculiim seminis is very much like that of C. hicuspidiitus 

 Claus. The anterior division is very low, extending but a little 

 beyond the porus. The posterior, bag-shaped portion reaches half- 

 M'ay to the po.sterior margin of the alxlominal segment. 



The egg-sacs are narrow and extend a little beyond the ends of 

 the .stylets. They usually contain from 10-12 dark ovse. 



Forbes gives 1.2 mm. for the length of C. inodeMus. I find it 

 slightly larger, 1 .3 mm. being an average length for females. 



The color of this species is most beautiful, violet and lavender 

 shades predominating. It is evenly distributed in the chitin and 

 persists in preserved material. There are usually a number of 

 large, orange-colored globules below the chitin. These are specially 

 numerous in the ccphalothorax and the swimming feet. 



C. modeslus can be readily distinguished from all other species by 

 the sixteen-jointed first antenna, the three-jointeil fifth foot, the 

 very characteristic stylets, and the receptncidum seminis. 



While nowhere an abundant species, ('. modeslus appears to be 

 very- generally distributed over the United States. Forbes reports 

 it from several localities in Illinois and from Grebe Lake in the 

 Yellowstone Park. Marsh found it in Rush Lake, Wisconsin, and 

 Herrick in Cullman County, Alabama. Miss Byrnes has recently 

 studied the species from the Long Island waters. I have found it, 

 always in small numbers, one of the rarer species of the genus from 

 this locality. 



In a collcH'tion from "Fresh Pond," Cambridge, Mass., made in 

 the fall of IDO'J, this form outnumbered all other species. It occurs 




1914.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 4! 



also in collections from Lake Winnepesaukee made during July and 

 August, 1909.

Synonymy and Distribution. — Though I am unable to translate 

 Lilljeborg's Swedish description of his new species C. rubellus, I am 

 convinced from the Latin synopsis as well as his drawings of the 

 receptaculum seminis and abdomen that this species is synonj^mous 

 with C. varicans Sars. His drawing of the receptaculum seminis- 

 shows this organ to have the form of that pictured by Schmeil (Taf. 

 VI, fig. 3) with a slightly greater e.xpansion of the "wings" of the 

 anterior division. By a careful study of this organ in a number of 

 specimens, I have concluded that what Lilljeborg pictures as the- 

 receptaculum seminis of the typo C. varicans (see Taf. IV, fig. 24, of 

 his paper of '01) is the extreme form of narrow anterior portion, 

 Schmeil's drawing showing a slightly greater expansion of this same 

 division. Lilljeborg's drawing of the receptaculum of C rubellus and 

 my own (PI. Ill, fig. 10) of this organ in C. varicans are examples of 

 the extremely wide and wing-like form. The proportional lengths 

 of the caudal setae, as shown by Lilljeborg, are identical with those- 

 of the typical varicans (PI. Ill, figs. 6 and 7). 



Miss Byrnes in her recent paper (March, '09) has described a species 

 of Cyclops under the name of C. bicolor. Her description of the- 

 antennse, which she .states "contain each twelve segments," at once 

 suggests C. varicans, for nowhere do I find a record of C. bicolor with 

 more than eleven joints in the first female antennee. Schmeil gives 

 eleven, Lilljeborg 10-11, and Marsh has noted a form with ten- 

 segmented antennse, though he finds the usual numl)er is eleven. 

 Herrick, with whose description she seems to have compared liei- 

 own, also gives eleven as the number of female antennal segments. 

 Miss Byrnes' formula for the swimming feet agrees exactly with that 

 of specimens examined from this locality. In speaking of the 

 variation of this species, she says: "The sjjecies C. bicolor is usually 

 placed {e.g., by Marsh) among Cyclops having ten or eleven segments. 

 The occurrence, therefore, of a twelve-jointed antenna shows that 

 considerable variation may occur in this organ. Except in this 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



respect, the form from Cold Spring Harbor agrees with Professor 

 Marsh's description." The above extract needs no comment. 

 Herrick assigns C. varicans a place among the twelve-jointed-antennte 

 forms having a too-segmented fifth foot. This may account for 

 Miss Byrnes' error, for Herrick's drawing of the fifth foot of C. varica7is 

 is quite incorrect. 



C. varicans is one of the rarer species of the genus. Schmcil 

 found it sparingly in the vicinity of Halle. Lilljeborg reports it and 

 describes it from Sweden. Herrick found it but once, and Mi.ss 

 Byrnes also collected it in a single instance from a pond on Long 

 Island, describing it as a twelve-jointed variation of C. bicolor. In 

 his summary of species Forbes records it as "a fairly common species 

 throughout the range of Cyclops in North America." I have found 

 it in small numbers in the March and April, 1909, collections in this 

 locality and sparingly in the vicinity of Cambridge, Mass., and 

 from Lake Winnepesaukee collections taken in July and August, 1909. 

 Specijic Description. — The first segment of the almost elliptical 

 cephalothorax (PI. Ill, fig. 6) is about as long as wide and a little 

 over half as long as the entire thorax (3 : 5). The lateral angles of 

 the third, fourth, and especially the fifth thoracic segments arc 

 ]n-ominent. The proportion of cephalothorax and abdomen is as 

 10 : 7. The posterior borders of all the thoracic segments are 

 smooth. The fifth .segment is somewhat flattened and extended 

 laterally. Its lateral edges protrude considerably beyond the first 

 abdominal segment. At the ends, of these wing-like projections of 

 the fifth thoracic segment are inserted long, curving, plumose setae, 

 which are usuallj^ considered homologous to the outer setae of the 

 basal segments of the two-jointed rudimentary fifth feet. The 

 fifth feet are inserted at the inner corners of the lateral projections 

 of the fifth thoracic segment on its posterior edge (PI. Ill, fig. 9). 



The first abdominal segment is considerably expanded in its 

 anterior half (PI. Ill, figs. 6 and 10). The entire abdomen, which 

 is rather slim, tapers gradually to the furca. The posterior borders 

 of the first three segments are smooth. On the posterior edge of 

 the fourth abdominal segment, ventrally placed and rarely extending 

 half way around tiie circumference of the segment, there is present 

 a short row of long serrations. 



The stylets (PI. Ill, fig. 7) taper slightly and are carried very 

 close together. They are slightly shorter than the last two abdominal 

 segments taken together. The outer apical bristle is rather heavy, 

 sparsely plumose, and nearly as long as the delicate inner one. Of 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



the two developed apical setae, the mner longer one is to the outer 

 as 10 : 7. Schmeil shows both of these setae to be evenly plumose 

 on their distal seven-eighths. This character is rarely present in the 

 specimens from this vicinity. The anterior plumose portion is 

 replaced by a short row of delicate spines on either side of the setae 

 (PI. Ill, fig. 7). These do not merge into the hair-like forms gradually, 

 but end abruptly at the beginning of the plumes as in the long 

 median caudal seta of C. phaleratus. The lateral spine is inserted 

 two-thirds of the length of the stylets from their anterior border. 

 It is usually delicately plumose, although the bare form is not rare. 



The female first antennae may have either eleven or twelve seg- 

 ments. The number given by Schmeil is twelve, but I have frequently 

 found eleven-jointed sexually mature forms, bearing eggs. Such 

 forms occur more freciuently in late winter and the twelve-jointed- 

 . antennae forms in April and May (PI. Ill, figs. 6 and 8). The antennae 

 are a little over two-thirds as long as the first thoracic segment. 

 The division from eleven to twelve joints takes place in the third 

 joint. The fourtli, fifth and sixth joints are often narrower than 

 the seventh and eighth. ]\Iost of the antennal bristles are not 

 plumose. Schmeil notes the presence of a well-developed, closely 

 lying sense-club on the ninth segment. This I cannot discover on 

 the specimens that have come under my observation. In its place 

 there is a minute sensory (?) hair. 



The first antennae of the male are peculiar in the unusual develop- 

 ment of the sensorj' structures of the first division. These are 

 larger than in any other species of the genus and may be readily 

 noted even under a slight magnification as long blue, semi-transparent, 

 narrow bag-shaped structures on the posterior side of the antennae. 

 The swunming feet are all two-jointed. The outer ramus of the 

 fourth pair is generally visible from above in life. This is due to 

 the unusually large lamella connecting these feet which makes them 

 protrude at a greater lateral angle. Schmeil notes that the fourth 

 pair of swimming feet is less fully developed than the other three 

 pairs. In fig. 11 of PI. Ill I have shown a foot of the third pair. 

 It is interesting to note an indication of the third segment; a row of 

 short hairs at the middle of the distal segment of the outer ramus 

 and a group of longer hairs on the corresponding segment of the 

 inner ramus. This character is always present in the first three 

 pairs of swimming feet. 



The armature of the swimming feet is as follows: 

 First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 

 seta, one spine, four setae. 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setse; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, five setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, five setse. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setse; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, three setae. 



The above armature is quite constant. Herrick states the fifth 

 foot is two-jointed. Since he has only collecte<.l the species in a 

 single instance, this must he considered an error. There is often a 

 very inconspicuous indication of a former large basal segment 

 (PI. Ill, fig. 9), but the movable fifth foot consists of a single cylin- 

 drical joint. At the middle of its distal end there is borne a long, 

 delicately plumose seta (PI. Ill, fig. 9). 



The shape of the receptaculuin seitiinis has already been discussed. 

 Fig. 5 of PI. Ill shows what is probal)ly the extreme "wing-like" 

 formation of the anterior division. The ]X)sterior portion is about 

 a.s long as the anterior and has the form of a short bag. The porus 

 is situated immediately between the two portions on the narrow 

 transverse division that extends entirely across the first alidoniitial 

 segment. 



The egg-sacs contain from ten to twelve ovac and are carrietl at a 

 slight angle from the abdomen. 



The following measurements of six females taken at different 

 times give an average length of .867 mn\. 



Total length = .895 nun. 

 " = .841 mm. 

 ■' '' = .9()G mm. 



" = .90 mm. 

 " = .89 mm. 

 " = .89 mm. 



The females average .21 mm. in width. The males are somewhat 

 smaller than the females — .69 mm. being an average length. Schmeil 

 gives .8-.92 nun. for the .size of the females and "about" .7 mm. for 

 the males. Sars' figures are somewhat greater — 1 mm. Herrick 

 gives .8 mm. 



The color of C. varicans is ordinarily very i)ale. A faint shade of 

 yellow is noticeable throughout the body, making the animal un- 

 usually inconspicuous. It may be readily distinguished from all 

 other species of the genus by it'^ short, twelve-jointed anteuna'. the 

 very characteristic receplaculum ncminia, and the two-jointed swim- 

 ming feet.

Specific Description. — The form of the cephalothorax in this, the 

 smallest species found in this locality, is that of an ellipse slightly 

 flattened at the ends. The first segment is to the total length of the 

 cephalothorax as 5:7. Its length is to its width as 5:4. The 

 lateral angles of all the thoracic segments are obscure. Their 

 posterior borders arc unserrated. The lateral edges of the last 

 segment bear each a fringe of very minute hairs (PI. Ill, fig. 5). 



The abdomen, which is to the cephalothorax as 5 : 9, is rather 

 slender and tapers only slightly towards its posterior end. The 

 fir.st segment is enlarged at its anterior end and about as wide as the 

 last cephalothoracic segment. The posterior borders of all the 

 abdominal segments arc unevenly and minutely serrated. 



The short stylets (PI. Ill, figs. 1 and 2) stand well apart in the 

 living animal. The lateral spines are situated | of the length of the 

 .stylets from their anterior end. Of the apical seta; only two are 

 well developed. The inner and outer bristles are small. Of these 

 the outer is much heavier and is slightly shorter than the inner. 

 Neither attains the length of the stylets. Of the large middle pair 

 the inner is to the outer as 5 : 3. Brewer gives 4 :5 "or equal." 

 The larger of the two is four times, the shorter about three times, as 

 long as the stylets. Both are delicately plumose. 



The first pair of (twelve-jointed) anteimaj (PI. Ill, fig. 1) reach in 

 the female to the posterior border of the third thoracic segment. 

 Forbes finds them often reaching "quite to the first abdominal 

 segment. " The eighth joint is the longest, exceeding that of the two 

 preceding segments. Dr. Schmeil finds on the ninth segment a 

 "well-developed sense-club," and, in his foot-note, states that 

 Richard "even denied the presence of a sense-club." All of my 

 specimens agree with Forbes' description in the absence of the 

 sense-club, but "minute sensory bristle" on the tenth segment. 

 This seems, then, to be undoubtedly a characteristic point of differ- 




46 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



eiice from the European forms. The three terminal joints are 

 slightlj' curved and each bears a well-developed hyaline plate. The 

 edges of these plates, which Forbes found to be entire, seem to vary. 

 I have frequently found them finely serrated on the distal third of 

 the terminal segmental plate. Again I have noted a very distinct 

 notch or indentation at the posterior end of the serrations. This 

 resembles somewhat the characteristic "notch" in the corresponding 

 plate of Cyclops kuckarti Claus, though it is not .so deep nor con- 

 spicuous. Occasionally I have observed a specimen in which all 

 three hyaline plates w-ere finely serrated. The commonest form ha-< 

 two of the plates with smooth edges, though the plate of the la*t 

 segment invariably has the slight notch mentioned above (PI. III. 



fig. 3). 



The very long and strong sette on the first and fourth antennal 

 segments and the change of direction of the remaining segments 

 beyond the fourth, as well as the short caudal stylets, suggest a 

 superficial resemblance to Cyclops modestus Herrick. . 



The four pairs of swimming feet are armed as follows: 



First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five sette; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, six 



seta?. 

 Third pair — like second. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, three setae. 



Both the spines and setae of these feet 'are peculiarly long and 

 slender. 



The rudimentary fifth foot (PI. Ill, fig. 4) consists of a single .seg- 

 ment, armed with a spine and two setae. The spine is inserted 

 immediately above the characteristic bulge of the minutely plumose 

 inner side. The longer of the tv/o setee is borne at the end of a cone- 

 shaped projection of the distal end of the ."segment. The remaining 

 seta is inserted on the outer siilc of the segment at the base of iIk- 

 cone-like process. Its length is two-thirds that of the ai)ical seta 

 and slightly greater than that of the spine. Both the sette are 

 delicately jilumose; the spine is more coarsely so. Brewer notes that 

 the "three setae" are bare in his specimens. 



The form of the rcccptaculum seminis (PI. Ill, fig. 5) is the most 

 characteristic feature of this species, though it is freciucntly cjuite 

 difficult to distinguish owing to the density of the pigment matter 

 in the first abdominal segment. It consists of two very distinct 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 47 



divisions. The anterior portion has a central arm extending half- 

 way to the upper edge of the first abdominal segment, which branches 

 into two wing-like projections at right angles to the central arm and 

 extending transversely across the abdomen on either side of the 

 median line. The outer ends of these projections are often slightly 

 enlarged. Forbes and Schmeil both find that these side arms are 

 "S-shaped." Among all the specimens that I have examined from 

 this locality, I have noted the "S shape" in only one instance. In 

 many cases the outer ends of the wing-forms tend to turn up slightly, 

 but the "8-shaped" canals are certainly the exception and not the 

 rule among the local representatives of this species. Consequently, 

 in my drawing (PI. Ill, fig. 5) I have shown what I consider a rather 

 more characteristic form of the receptaculum seminis for C. prasinus. 

 This somewhat insignificant detail shows that the receptaculum 

 seminis may be a variable character. 



The portion of the receptaculum behind the suture consists of two 

 lateral sacs connected by a narrow transverse canal lying close under 

 the suture. In the middle of the anterior edge of this lower con- 

 necting arm is the porus. The anterior division of the receptaculum 

 fuses with the posterior at this same point. 



The contents of the upper and lower portions differ in appearance 

 only. Dr. Schmeil has proved that the spermatozoa in the upper 

 portion are simply more densely packed together than in the lower. 



The egg-sacs contain only a few ova. I have never noted more 

 than ten; seven is an average number. They adhere closely to the 

 abdomen, often covering two-thirds of its dorsal area. 



An average length for the female from this locality is .82 mm. 

 Forbes gives .48-.7 mm. Some of the European measurements 

 are as follows: 



Vosseler 1-0 mm. 



Richard -9 mm. (after Schmeil). 



Vernet .88 mm. 



Schmeil -S-.Q mm. 



The males average .62 mm. long and .14 wide. They have a very 

 long setae at the distal end of the first division of the first antennae. 



The color seems to be quite constant. The first thoracic segment 

 is a pale yellowish-brown with irregular patches of blue-green along 

 its posterior border. The remaining thoracic segments are a deep 

 shade of blue-green. The first abdominal segment is brown, more 

 dense in the anterior half. The remaining segments are irregularly 

 l>lotched with the thoracic shade of green which becomes solid in 




48 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.UDEMY OF [Jan., 



the stylets. The first pair of antennae are a brownish-yellow; their 

 anterior border is often tinged with green. Forbes has "seen both 

 blue and pink individuals." Herrick found that the color varies 

 "from deep indigo to greenish-brown." Cragin states: "Animal 

 ilirty blue-green, antenns lighter. Dark green pigment masses are 

 scattered beneath the integument in various places, particularly 

 along the anterior side of the first antennae. " 



This species is quite generally distributed over the eastern and 

 central United States. Herrick found it in Lake Minnetonka, Minn. 

 Marsh reports the species from Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, and some 

 of the smaller lakes of Michigan and "Wisconsin. Forbes has found 

 it in collections from Sister Lake, Fla., and many localities in the 

 State of Illinois. As C. fluviatilis Herrick, Brewer reports it from 

 the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska, and Miss Byrnes from Long 

 Island. Miss E. R. Walker reports it as the most abundant form 

 from Todd's Pond, Oregon. It is one of the most abundant forms 

 in September and October dredgings, but I have noted only a few 

 .individuals during the winter months. 



It is easily distinguished by its small size, its hal)it of swimming 

 near the surface, its dark color (it frequently appears to lie black 

 to the naked eye), and, under thp micro.scope, by the very charac- 

 teristic form of the receptaculum seminis and short caudal setae.

Specific Description. — The first .segment of the unusually broad 

 cephalothorax is a little longer than the other four thoracic segments. 

 Its width is slightly greater than its length. The posterior borders 

 of the first three thoracic segments are smooth. The fourth segment 

 is ornamented with a minute fringe of short serrations. The chitinous 

 covering of the fifth thoracic segment is composed of a continuous 

 cylinder like the abdominal segments, and not of a dorsal and ventral 

 plate, as is the case in the corresponding segment of other species of 

 this genus. This segment is armed ventrally along its posterior 

 margin by a row of heavy, cone-shaped teeth (PI. I\'. fig. 4) which 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 49 



e.xtend at a slight angle and not parallel to the body. This row is, 

 furthermore, not continuous, but generally interrupted in the middle 

 for a short distance on either side of the median line. Occasionally, 

 however, I have noted specimens in which this row of spinules is 

 practically continuous, though there is always a slight break. The 

 length of the entire cephalothorax to that of the abdomen is as 7 : 5. 

 The first abdominal segment is very slightly smaller than the 

 fifth thoracic segment, and the whole abdomen tapers but little. 

 Ht)w small this taper is may be readily seen from the following pro- 

 portional width of each segment at its posterior border. 



First segment 27 



Second segment 26 



Third segment 24 



Fourth segment 21 



The proportional lengths of the four abdominal segments beginning 

 with first are 11 :7 :6 : 2. All the segments are cylindrical. The 

 posterior borders of the first, second, and third segments are minutely 

 serrated (PI. IV, fig. 2). The last abdominal segment is less than one- 

 fifth as long as the first segment and bears on its posterior border a 

 fringe of unusually long and heavy .spines (PI. IV, fig. 2). 



The stylets are short (PI. IV, fig. 2). Their length and width are 

 to each other as 4 : 3 — a proportion that shows them to be very wide. 

 Below the point of insertion of the short lateral spine, which may or 

 may not be plumose, the stylets taper rapidly. In addition to this 

 lateral spine, there is a row of slightly shorter spinules (usually from- 

 four to six) extending from the lateral spine, ventrally, slightly below 

 the middle of the side of each stylet. Forbes mentions "a row of 

 long spinules on the ventral side of each ramus, extending from the 

 middle line of the anterior border to the point of insertion of the 

 lateral spine." I have never noted such a row of spinules in an.y of 

 my specimens, though this entire minutely spinose armament of the 

 stylets must l)e considered a variable feature. There are two or 

 three rows of minute hairs extending obliquely from the middle of 

 the anterior border of each stylet towards the posterior border. 

 The interior border of the stylets is often plumose (Schmeil found 

 an "unbehaarten Innenrande") and the inner and posterior dorsal 

 surfaces are armed with irregular groups and rows of short, blunt 

 spines (PI. IV, fig. 2). Forbes and Schmeil both note that the 

 outermost apical bristle "is placed high up on the side of the stylet. " 

 In his fig. 1 on pi. VIII, Schmeil has shown this to be the case, but 

 in fig. 2 of the same plate he shows this spine inserted directly beside 

 4 




50 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the shorter of the two developed caudal setiB. I have found it only 

 as he shows in fig. 2 (PI. IV, fig. 2). This spine is often quite blunt 

 and always densely plumose on both sides. At the point of insertion 

 there are several long, dorsally placed serrations extending a third 

 of the distance about the base of the spine. The innermost bristle 

 is very delicate, about as long as the outer, and plumose on its outer 

 side onlj'. Of the two well-developed median bristles, the inner is 

 from two and one-half to three times as long as the outer. Its first 

 third is bare, the middle portion fringed with small spines, and the 

 last third finely plumose. It is longer than the abdomen and un- 

 usually wide at its insertion point. The smaller of the two developed 

 caudal setae is bare for one-quapf-er of its length, thence to its tip it 

 is fringed with a row of small spines on the outside and delicately 

 plumose on the inner. Between the insertion point and the beginning 

 of the outside row of spines there is often a minute fringe of hairs. 

 The dorsal median seta is quite slender, a little longer than the outer 

 apical spine, and not plumos(\ 



The first antennae of the female (PI. I\', fig. 3) arc eleven-jointed 

 in most cases, though the ten-jointed form appears occasionally. 

 Sehmeil records only the ten-jointed form from Germany, and 

 Lilljeborg the same from Sweden in his paper of 1901. Forbes 

 states that they "may be either ten- or eleven-segmented," and 

 Miss Byrn(>s has noted a single individual in which the left antenna 

 had eleven, the right but ten segments. I have noted a similar 

 individual in a single case. Herrick found that "the antenna is 

 usually ten-jointed, but frequently is eleven-jointed (?), and is much 

 shorter than the first thoracic segment." The question-mark .seems 

 to indicate some doubt as to the existence of the eleven-jointed form, 

 though subsequent workers have verified his observation in the ca.'^e 

 of the American representatives of this species. It is interesting to 

 note here that the eleven-jointed form has, as far as I am able to 

 ascertain, been recorded only by the .Vmerican investigators. In 

 the eleven-jointed form there is borne at the distal end of the eighth 

 segment, in place of a sense-club, a minute sensory l)ri.stle. The 

 antenna- taper but little in the first nine joints, the last two being 

 consideral)ly narrower than the others. The last joint bears an 

 unusually strongly developed seta. The armature of the other 

 antennal joints is quite uniform. The length of the female first 

 antennse is a little more than half that of the first cephalothoracie 

 .segment. 



Sehmeil states the first antennie of the male are normal. I have 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 51 



noted that there is on the last division an unusually large spine, set 

 well towards the distal end. There is also a small blunt spine with' a 

 large comb-like fringe on its outer margin, placed about in the 

 middle of the second large division of the male antennae. The re- 

 maining spines are rather smaller than in other species. On the 

 joints of the first division there are present, on the under side, the 

 usual long, blunt, finely plumose sensory structures. 



The second antenna are very short and broad. The long curving 

 seta of the basal segment I have never found to be evenly plumose 

 as Schmeil shows it. It is usually armed with a row of short spinules 

 on each side of its distal three quarters, while the first quarter bears, 

 only on its upper side, an uneven row of longer spinules. The 

 second segment bears on its outer side a double row of delicate spines, 

 and on its upper sitle a fringe of spinules and near its distal end a 

 peculiar spine. The distal half of this spine is curved and bears on 

 its upper side a comb-like fringe of fine spinules. The smaller spine 

 on the distal end of the third segment has this same peculiar curve 

 and fringe. The curved setse at the top of the fourth segment are 

 short and very broad. 



The four pairs of swimming feet are all three-segmented, both 

 spines and setae are well developed, and the outer edges of the first 

 and second segments of each ramus bear rows of heavy spinules. 

 The armature is most variable. For example, I have found on the 

 outer ramus of the first pair either three or four spines and five setae. 

 Again in the second pair on the corresponding ramus I have found 

 four spines with either four or five setce. In another case I have found 

 on the outer ramus of the fourth foot of the right side, three spines 

 and five setae and on the same ramus of the opposite side four spines 

 and four setae. Furthermore, the armature of the inner ramus of 

 the second and third pairs of swimming feet differs consistently from 

 that given by Forbes, in the presence of an extra seta on the inner 

 side. This seta is very obscure and may be overlooked on account 

 of the long spinules on the same side of the ramus, but its existence 

 can be positively identified by its position and by the fact that, 

 though it is -often not much larger than the accompanying spinules, 

 it is the only one that is plumose. I give this rather lengthy dis- 

 cussion of the swimming feet merely as an example of the armature 

 not being constant nor reliable as a point of differentiation of species. 

 (See Introduction.) The following is an average armature for the 

 local specimens : 



First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 

 seta, one spine, four setae. 




52 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five seta; inner ramus, one 



seta, one spine, four setae. 

 Third pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, one .spine, four setae. 

 Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 



seta, two spines, two setae. 



The fifth feet (PI. IV, fig. 4) are merely flange-like projections of 

 the fifth thoracic segment. They are more lateral than ventral, and 

 the^e is ordinarily no line marking the position of a former segment. 

 Occasionallj', however, I have noted a faint indication of a possible 

 segment, extending from the base of the outer spine obliqueh' to a 

 point below the inner spine where the large row. of serrations con- 

 necting the two fifth feet ceases (see description of cephalothora.x 

 and fig. 4, PI. IV). The fifth foot is armed with three nearly equal 

 spines, of which the inner is coarsely plumose, the middle one more 

 finely plumose, and the outer bare or finely and sparingly plumose 

 on its outer side. Schmcil's criticism of Bradj^'s "otherwise excellent 

 drawing, " in which he shows all three spines to be plumose, is hardly 

 justifiable (see note 2, p. 176, of Schmeil's monograph). In addition 

 to the three large spines there are several small serrations about the 

 base of the inner spine and an uneven mass of similar small serrations 

 laterally below the outer spine. 



The receptaculum seimnis consists of two nearly equal divisions 

 extending as narrow bands transversely across the entire first 

 abdominal segment. The porus is situated in the middle of the 

 short, meilian, common portion. Owing to the dark color of this 

 species, the structure of the receptaculum is extremely difficult to 

 ol)serve. 



The egg-sacs are borne close to the abdomen and frequently extend 

 quite beyond the end of the stylets. They usually contain from ten 

 to twenty largo dark eggs. The oviducts arc of unusual interest in this 

 si)ecies. While in all other species they terminate within the cephalo- 

 thorax, in C. phaleratus they extend as a blind duct to the anterior 

 border of the fourth abdominal segment (PI. IV, fig. 1). 



The following measurements of six females covering collections 

 from the same spot during two years, give an average length of 

 1.73 mm. 



No. 1 Total length = 1 .6 



No. 2 ., " " = 1.95 



No. 3 „ " " = 1.88 



No. 4 " " = 1.78 



No. 5 ..„ " " =1.61 



No. 6 " " = 1.6 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



The males are only a little smaller — 1.6 mm. being an average length 

 for local specimens. The coloring of C. phaleratus is most brilliant. 

 The ground-colopj which in this species is directly in the chitin, is a 

 brick-red. The second thoracic segment, the last abdominal segment, 

 the stylets and the caudal setse and spines, the swimming feet, tke 

 mouth parts, second antennae, and the last segment of the first antennae 

 are sky-blue, which varies in intensity. Often these parts appear 

 quite colorless. The egg-sacs are dark blue or lavender in the first 

 stages of development. 



C. phaleratus Is a pelagic species. In aquaria it may often be 

 found a little above the water line, where it sometimes crawls even 

 beyond the upper margin of the meniscus line. Its swimming 

 • motion is a rapidly darting one. The easiest way of distinguishing 

 it from all other members ®f the genus is by its superficial resemblance 

 to the genus Canthocarnptus. The short, eleven-jointed antennae, 

 and form of the rudimentary fifth feet, are certain microscopic points 

 of identification. 



This species seems to be very widely distributed in America, though 

 nowhere is it particularly abundant. Forbes reports it from several 

 localities in Illinois and Wisconsin and from Portage La Prairie, 

 Manitoba. Marsh has found it in several of the Michigan lakes 

 and Cragin reports it from Cambridge, Mass., as Cyclops perarmatus. 

 Miss Byrnes has studied the species on Long Island, where she found 

 it in "shallow, fresli-water ponds." I have noted it rather more 

 abundantly in the spring collections, but never in great numbers from 

 the vicinity of Haverford, Pa., and from a small spring-water pond 

 near Gillette, Wyoming, as well as in collections from Lake Winne- 

 pesaukee and the vicinity of Cambridge, Mass.

Synonymy and Distribution. — In his Beitrdge zur Kenntniss, etc., 

 of '91, Schmeil considered Cyclops poppei Rehberg, .synonymous 

 with the typical C. fimbriatus. The following. year, however, after 

 a more careful study of the species, though he still claimed the 

 differences to be too few to warrant a new species, he granted that 




54 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



there should be a variety of C. fimbriatus, which he named C. fimbriatus 

 var. poppei Rehberg. 



All of Herrick's drawings of the stylets of what he describes as 

 C. fimbriatus Fischer show that his specimens belonged to the var. 

 poppei, and not to the typical form. Forbes recognizes the varietj' 

 poppei, but gives no description or figures in connection with his 

 note of the occurrence of the species. Miss Byrnes, following 

 Herrick's mistake, has described this variety as the typical C. fim- 

 briatus from Long Island. Her fig. 5, pi. XY, of the stylets with 

 their characteristic armature of a longitudinal row of spines proves 

 that the animal examined by her was not fimbriatus, but the variety 

 poppei of Rehberg. There has been not a little confusion of the 

 above-mentioned two forms. I cannot find a single description of 

 the typical C. fimbriatus Fischer by aiij' American investigator. 

 The speciies seems to be represented in this country Ijy the variety 

 only. This has been described at least twice under the name of the 

 type form. 



Cyclops fimbriatus var. poppei seems to be one of the rarer species 

 of the genus. Several of the investigators have failed to find it. 

 Kofoid states in his Plankton of the Illinois River, "E. B. Forbes 

 ('97) records in May, September, 189G, C. varicans Sars as common, 

 and C. fimbriatus var. poppei Rehberg and C. bicolor Sars as rare." 

 Forties states that this is "a rare species in Manitolia, Alabama, 

 and the north central States." Brewer does not record it from the 

 waters about Lincoln, Nebraska. jV^arsh, in '95, names "fimbriatus'' 

 in his Key to Species of Cyclops, but givo^; no dcscrijition. Mi.ss 

 Byrnes has studied the species from Long Island waters, where she 

 states thai "Cyclops fimbriatus has been taken in great numbers — 

 especially in the collections made in the early spring." This ob.ser- 

 vation agrees very closely with my own regarding the varietj- poppei 

 in this vicinity. In a collection made in the spring (March) of 1907 

 if was the most abundant form. I have never recorded it from 

 September to January. In February, 1909, I found a few egg-bearing 

 ftsmales. I consider it one of the rarest of the members of the genus 

 found in this locality. 



Specific Description. — The somewhat slim cephalothora.x (PI. I\', 

 fig. 5) tapers only slightly posteriorly. The first segment is half as 

 long as the entire thorax. The dorso-ventral diameter is short in 

 proportion to the length of the animal. In a .specimen measuring 

 1.13 mm. it was but .14 mm. The width of the three posterior 

 thoracic segments diminishes but a little. The lateral angles of the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



thoracic segments are not prominent. Both Herrick and Miss 

 Byrnes have obviously drawn their specimens under pressure, when, 

 as I have repeatedly observed, the thoracic outline is entirely changed. 

 Fig. 5, PI. IV, shows the form of cephalothorax in life. The third 

 .segment is finely serrated along its entire posterior margin (fig. 10, 

 PI. IV). These serrations often are slightly larger at the end of the 

 marginal row. The fourth thoracic segment bears, laterally, a short 

 row of minute but rather coarse "hairs" (fig. 11, PI. IV). On the 

 corresponding portions of the fifth segment there are present similar 

 short rows of coarse hairs, but on this segment they are much larger 

 (fig. 8, PI. IV). The entire cephalothorax is to the abdomen as 7 : 5. 

 Its length to its width is as 2 : 1. 



■ The abdomen is wide, the first segment being but a little narrower 

 than the fifth segment of the thorax. In my drawing of the living 

 animal (fig. 5, PI. IV) the first abdominal segment is foreshortened 

 owing to the curve of the entire dorsal surface. This fact, taken 

 together with the short first antennae and the method of locomotion, 

 .suggests a strong resemblance to members of the genus Cantho- 

 camptus. The first three abdominal segments are finely serrate on 

 their posterior margins. These serrations in the fourth segment, 

 instead of stopping at the sides of the anal opening, turn anteriorly 

 and extend a short distance along either side of this opening. There 

 are, furthermore, between the upturned portion of the posterior row 

 of serrations and the side of the anal opening, two very minute rows 

 of what Schmeil calls "button-like projections" (fig. 6, PI. IV). 

 Neither Herrick's nor Miss Byrnes' drawings give an accurate view 

 of this armature, though the former evidently noticed this detail 

 from his fig. 11, PI. 21, of his report of '95. Miss Byrnes' drawing 

 shows the marginal row of serrations of the fourth abdominal segment 

 extending across the anal opening. All the abdominal segments 

 -bear transverse rows of minute indentations of the form of the 

 marginal serrations, but not projections of the cuticula. This may 

 easily be proved by turning the animal on its side, when the dorsal 

 and ventral lines of the abdominal segments will appear as unbroken 

 lines. I find this character quite constant in specimens of the 

 variety poppei, though Schmeil notes that it is often missing in the 

 type fimbriatus. 



The stylets (fig. 6, PI. IV) differ from those of the typical fimbriatus. 

 They are only as long as the last two abdominal segments. Their 

 length is three times their width and their inner margins almost meet 

 at the point of insertion in the abdomen. One of the main differences 




56 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



between this form and the type lies in the characteristic armature 

 of the dorsal surface of the stylets. The lateral spine is inserted 

 well towards the median line. On the outer lateral surfaces ami a 

 little below the position usually occupied by the lateral spine there 

 is a row of prominent serrations. The position and course of this 

 row of serrations may be seen in fig. 6 of PI. IV. There are two well- 

 developed apical setee which are carried prominently divaricate. Of 

 these two, the outer is a little over half as long as the inner and is 

 ornamented on its outer surface with minute spines, its inner surface 

 bearing the usual hairs. Herrick's statement, "inner two-thirds as 

 long as the outer," is undoubtedly another case of reversed propor- 

 tions. The longer seta is plumose. The delicate innermost seta? 

 are as long as the outer and generally curved as in fig. 6, PI. IV. 

 The outermost setse are very heavy, rather blunt and delicately 

 plumose on their inner surface onlj'. About the Ijase of each there 

 is a f circle of long serrations. 



The first antennse of the female (fig. 7, PL IV) are eight-jointed. 

 They are only half as long as the first thoracic segment antl arc 

 carried at right angles to the median line, as is the case with practically 

 all of the Cyclopidw. The segments taper rapidly, the distal one 

 being but one-quarter as wide as the first at its line of juncture with 

 the second. The fourth segment is the longest. The two distal 

 segments are slightly bent forward in life (fig. .5, PI. IV). Herrick 

 states: "The basal joint with a small semicircular .series of fine 

 bristles." This is not a characteristic of this species, but of the 

 entire genus. Miss Byrnes' tlescrijjtion is this: "The antcnme 

 contain but eight segments; they are short and are characterized 

 bj' two well-developed setse." The fifth segment bears a wcll- 

 develo])('d sensr-club (fig. 7, PI. IV). This is somewhat diffen-nt, 

 from Schmeil's figure of this organ for the type form. In the speci- 

 mens that I have examined I find it to be rather more slim and 

 spear-shajjod than "club-shaped" as in the type. It suggests the 

 form of the corresponding organ in C. bicuspidatus CJlaus (PI. II, 

 fig. 5). Many of the seta; of the first seven segments are delicately 

 plumose, l)Ut those of the terminal segment are, as far a'^ I have l)een 

 able to observe, quite bare. Along the line of the distal thinl of the 

 third segment (fig. 7, PI. IV) I have repeatedly noted what appears 

 to be the i)eginning of the segmentation of another antennal joint. 

 However, I have never observed a specimen of "var. poppei" with 

 nine-jointed first antenna. The semicircle of fine bristles at the 

 base of the first joint is unusually prominent. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



The antennules are characterized by the two very short terminal 

 segments. 

 The armature of the three-jointed swimming feet is as follows: 



First pair — outer ramus, three spines, five- setae; inner ramus, one- 

 seta, one spine, four setae. 



Second pair — outer ramus, four spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 

 .seta, one spine, four setae. 



Third pair — like the second pair. 



Fourth pair — outer ramus, three spines, five setae; inner ramus, one 

 seta, two spines, two setae. 



The inner margins of all the branches of the swimmmg feet are 

 ornamented with rows of bristles. This is especially the case in the 

 second, third, and fourth pairs. In her description of the variations 

 of this species, Miss Byrnes says: "The most striking variation in 

 C. fimbriatus is a tendency toward a reduction in the armature of 

 the inner ramus of the first swimming feet, where in the apical 

 position, for exami^le, a single large spine replaced two setae or a 

 spine and a seta, which is the typical armature of the organ. " She- 

 does not give the "typical armature" in her table, and the small seta 

 on the inner side of the imier ramus of the first pair of swimming, 

 feet she has probably overlooked. 



The fifth foot (fig. 8, PI. IV), which is one-jointed, I find bearing 

 the following armature: On the inner side of the distal end of the 

 single segment there is &, heavy spine, serrate on its inner surface 

 and finely but not densely plumose on its outer margin. The row of 

 minute serrations which Schmeil shows to be present in the type 

 form at the base of the corresponding spine (see his Taf. VII, fig. 12) 

 I do not find at all after a careful examination of a number of speci- 

 mens. There is a single spine-like projection at the base of the 

 inner spine, but no indication of a row. On the outer distal corner 

 of the fifth foot there is a very coarse spine-like seta that is denselj' 

 plumose on its inner and outer side. These two "spines" (the 

 outer is more nearly a spine than a seta) are of equal length. Between 

 them and borne at the end of a button-like process is the middle 

 seta, slightly longer than the two spines and plumose on its distal 

 half. Rehberg noted that "das rudimentare Fiisschen ist mit zwel 

 gleichlangen Dornen und einem klirzeren Haar besetzt, wahrend 

 sich bei Cycl. fimbriatus nur ein kurzer Dorn und zwei lange Haarea 

 befinden. " Schmeil admits that Rehberg's description and drawing, 

 is quite accurate, states, however, that the fifth feet in type and 

 variety are identical. I am inclined to agree with Rehberg that 




58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



the outer seta of the type form is replaced in his variety Ijy a spine. 

 There has been much confusion over this point. Herrick states 

 that the fifth foot has "three spines." Miss Byrnes agrees m her 

 ■description with Schmeil, for she finds "a coarse inner spine and two 

 setae." This is undoubtedly one of those details of .structure which 

 may vary considerably, and I merely give the observations of the 

 investigators to show their opinions on this point. 



The reccptacuhun seminis (fig. 4, PI. IV) is of a very characteristic 

 form. It consists of two portions. These are in the shape of long, 

 closelj' lying narrow ellipses. The upper portion has a slight inden- 

 tation in the middle of its anterior margin and the ends are slightly 

 upturned. The porus is situated in the middle of the short common 

 portion which connects the two divisions of this organ. The struc- 

 ture of the receptaculum seminis has never before been observed in 

 the American representatives of this variety. The egg-sacs contain 

 but a few dark ovse, 7-lX), and are carried close to the abdomen in 

 life. 



I have found that 1.17 mm. is an average length for females of the 

 variety poppei. Schmeil gives .86 mm. and Herrick .8 mm. Tiic 

 former states that "die Varietat ist ctwas kleiner als die typische 

 Form." For the "typische Form" Schmeil gives for the female 

 ^'0.92-1 mm." The smallest mature female that I have measured 

 was 1.13 mm. long — longer than the typical European form. 

 Schmcil's observations on the size of this species does not seem to 

 liold good, then, for the American .forms. In fact, the reverse is 

 true of specimens from this vicinity. Further study of the species 

 will undoubtedly show that type and variety are of a size. 



The variety poppei is practically colorless. Irregular chains 

 (fig. 5, PI. IV) of ro.se-colored globules are scattered occasionally 

 throughout botii cephalothora.x and alxlomen, and the ovaries, when 

 distended, api)ear a deep shade of lavender. 



The most readily distinguished characters of this variety are the 

 short eight-ji)intcil antenna' (which show that it belongs either to the 

 type or variety) and the verj' characteristic armature of the dorsal 

 surfaces of the caudal stylets. 



The following table illustrates the main points of difference between 

 type and variety:

N. B. — Since the compilation of the above table I have had occasion to examine 

 collections from Lake \\'innepesaukee, N. H., in which a form occurs which 

 bridges over the gap between type and variety as regards character No. 4. In 

 these forms the transverse row of serrations on stylets is exactly as in the type 

 form as figiu-ed by Schmeil, but the proportional length of stylets agrees with var. 

 poppei and not with the type form.

 Fischer are not given in this paper. The latter form is perhaps the 

 commonest one of the genus and will not he mistaken for any other 

 since no other American form approaches it in morpholtjgical details. 

 Forbes has di.scussed the synonymy in his paper of 1)7, but since 

 that time several European investigators have established new 

 species and varieties all intimately related with the type form. A 

 careful comparative study of these new forms will be necessary before 

 the description of C. serrulatus Fischer can be i)rought up to date. 

 It is known to be a most variable form. Size and stylet proportions 

 are rarely constant in intlividuals- taken at the same locality and 

 even in the same collection.

A STUDY OF THE SPECIES OF THE GENUS DICHOPETALA (ORTHOPTEHA: 



TETTIGONIIDa:). 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN \SD MORGAN HEBARD. 



The possession of the extensive series of this genus secured l)y us 

 in the southwestern United States in the summers of 1910 and 1912, 

 Tvith the acquisition by the junior author of the very important 

 jepresentation of the same group contained in the Bruner Collec- 

 tion, prompted us to make a detailed study of this interesting but 

 previously little-kno^\Ti genus of long-horned grasshoppers. The 

 •scope of our work became so extended that practically all the material 

 of the genus in American collections was finally examined. The 

 few tj^pes contained in European collections were relatively unimpor- 

 tant. Our work has required the description of a number of new 

 forms and the synonymizing of several old ones. 



The color description-; have been based on Ridgway's recent set 

 of color standards.'

Classification. — From a systematic standpoint, the characters of 

 greatest value in the differentiation of the species are: in both sexes, 

 general form of the body antl shape of the eyes; in the male, form of 

 the pronotum, form of the tegmina, form of the cerci and subgenital 

 plate; in the female, form of the pronotum, form of the tegmina,

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Jan., 



relative size and width of space between the tegmina, form of the 

 ovipositor and that of the subgenital plate.- The general form is 

 much more robust in some species than in others, the females almost 

 always more robust than the males, in falcata and pollicifcra less 

 different in this respect than in the other forms. The outline of the 

 eye is, in a few cases, of assistance in distinguishing females of closely 

 allied forms, as castanea and brevihastata. The pronotum ranges 

 from not at all constricted, to decidedly constricted mesad in both 

 sexes. In the male sex the tegmina show modifications in the form 

 of the margins and the width of the fields, tlie prominence of the 

 stridulating vein and the projection of the sutural margin at the apex 

 of the same vein. The tegmina of the female are as diagnostic as 

 the more complex appendages of the male, their relative position and 

 the interspace between the same, as well as the form of their margins, 

 being of importance. The characters of the genitalia of the two sexes 

 are discussed in detail below. 



Morphological Notes on Male Genitalia. — The variation in struc- 

 tural form in the cerei of the male covers a number of types which 

 show six different lines of development, relatively as follows: 



mexicana 



I falcata 



durangensis 



f castanea 

 ( brevihastala 



D 



[ gladiator 

 \ emarginata 



forea:ca 

 ratinata 



{caudelli 

 Iridaclyla 



E — taurijormix 



C — pollieifera 



B — aerrijera 



The position of durangensis is more or less problematical, as we have 

 only nymphal males. 




Group D 



1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 67 



The extremes in structural variation in the form of the cerci are a 

 simple incurved falciform type, found in the group A, and one with 

 a median tooth and an accessory lobe from the base, found in group 

 F. The general cereal structure of the various groups can be pre- 

 sented best in tabular form. 



[ mexicana ] 

 . GroupA jy^;^^^„ j Simple, falciform. 



Group B (serrifera). — Simple, dorsal margin serrato-dentate. 



Group C {pollicifera). — With an external median tooth. 



Incertse sedis (durangensis). — With evidence of a dorsal median 



tooth. 



( castanea t 



brevihastata j With a dorsal median fork, developing 

 gladiator from a simple tooth to a large flattened 



emarginata I lobe covering the greater portion of the 

 orececa I distal section of the cereal shaft. 



catinata I 



Group E {tauriformis) . — With a greatly developed lobiform median 

 tooth arising from the external margin of the shaft, the distal portion 

 of the latter peculiarly modified. A transverse proximal lamella 

 present dorsad on the shaft. 



f tridadyla 1 With a dorsal median tooth and an accessory 

 Group r j (.Qy^^gin digitiform lobe from the base of the shaft. 



The species in group D exhibit a regular development in the form 

 of the dorsal median fork from a simple median tooth which becomes 

 depressed and flattened, spreading laterad until it is as wide as the 

 proximal portion of the shaft, to the other extreme which has it 

 modified into a great inverted spoon-like plate covering the greater 

 portion of the cereal shaft. The peculiar digitiform accessory 

 appendage of tridadyla and caudelli springs from a proximal trans- 

 verse ridge, which is apparently homologous with the more decided 

 transverse lamella found in the same region in tauriformis. 



From the evidence of eighteen immature males, belonging to six 

 species {durangensis, brevihastata, gladiator, orececa, catinata, and 

 pollicifera), it is evident that the separation of the median fork of 

 the cercus is never accomplished before the mature condition. Of 

 brevihastata and pollicifera we have material representing two con- 

 secutive instars, one preceding the mature condition, the other 

 species being represented by this stage alone. In the forms of 

 which we have two stages no indication of the lobe is apparent in 




68 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the earlier instar, while in the other stage, in all of the species repre- 

 sented in this condition, there is a more or less distinct indication of 

 an incipient lobe or tooth, this being most pronounced in durangensis 

 and catinala. In the latter this embryonic lobe is more definitely 

 formed than in duranyensls, consisting of an ovate vertical area of 

 relatively large size. In the closely related oreoeca, the incipient lobe 

 is not vertical, but horizontal in position. 



The male subgenital plate is very varied in form, the distal margin 

 ranging from truncate with lateral styliform processes to obomegoid 

 emarginate; the general form broad with the distal portion little 

 produced and narrowed, the lateral angles more or less Ijlunted, to 

 an opposite extreme, elongate, narrow, concave laterad with the 

 lateral angles acute, between which extremes are a number of modifi- 

 cations of one or the other. Quite curiously, there exists no correla- 

 tion between certain forms of cerci and certain forms of the subgenital 

 plate, forms nearly related in cereal structure, as orececa and catinata, 

 having very different subgenital plates. 



Morphological Notes on Female Genitalia. — The ovipositor ranges 

 in general form from the elongate, very slender, decidedly arcuate 

 type seen in gladiator, and the elongate robust type with a more or 

 less straight ventral margin as found in a numlier of species, to a 

 short, moderately arcuate form seen in castanea and brcvihastata. 

 It is evident that there is considerable individual variation in the 

 depth of the ovipositor, this being very apparent in those species 

 represented by consiclerable series, so much so that the extremes have 

 difl'ercnt facies, but the major portions of such scries always Ijridge 

 the ai)parent gaps. In ovipositor length there is marked variation 

 in gladiator and brcvihastata, this being most apparent in the former 

 species, the extremes of which are quite different in appearance. 

 We have before us ten female nymphs which we can positively refer 

 to five species {durangensis, brevihaslala, gladiator, orececa, and polli- 

 cifera). Of durangensis we have represented the second instar 

 preceding maturity, of breviliastata the two preceding maturity, and 

 of the other three species the instar preceding maturity. From this 

 material it is evident that the development of the ovipositor is very 

 rapid, l)ut in no ca.se do the external margins acquire distal teeth until 

 the mature condition is reached. In one specimen which is appar- 

 ently on the eve of the la.st ecdysis (the type of l(evis) the teeth of 

 the enclosed ovipositor can be seen tiirough the sheath when it is 

 held to the light. 



The subgenital plate of the female presents great diversity in 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 60 



development, which in its details are not always correlative with 

 apparent affinities. These diversities can be placed in two categories, 

 one {mexicana, falcata, durangensis, castanea, and brevihastata) with 

 the plate entire, the other (comprising the remaining species) with it 

 divided completely in two, at least as far as the chitinous portion is 

 concerned. In the first section we have from an extreme which is 

 very broad and short, with the distal margin emarginato-truncate, 

 to one gf a similar general form with the margin bisinuate to arcuato- 

 emarginate. In the second section we have even greater diversity, 

 the paired lobes varying from broad to very narrow, blunted to 

 aciculate, the general form of the margins differing to a lesser degree. 

 In the forms with an entire subgenital plate, the distal margin has a 

 different appearance when the plate is flat or when it is compressed", 

 which factor should always be considered in determining the character 

 of this margin. For the sake of uniformity, we have endeavored to 

 give thetharacter of this margin from the plate were it flattened out. 



Notes on Tegminal Structure. — In the male the tegmina are more 

 ample in oreoeca and more reduced in size in tridactyla than in the 

 other species. The angle of the sutur3l margin is very greatly pro- 

 duced in tridactyla and on the other hand almost imperceptible 

 .in catinata. The stridulating vein is apparent in all the forms 

 of the genus, but variable in strength and curvature, while the 

 tympanum is also of variable form and definition. In the female 

 the considerable variation in form and position indicated in the 

 generic description is not correlated wdth the general relationship 

 of the forms, as certain species with overlapping quadrate tegmina 

 and others with nearly contiguous similarly shaped tegmina occur 

 in sections of the genus which on sum total of characters are well 

 removed from one another. The reduction of the female tegmina 

 has proceeded further in emarginata than in any other form of the 

 genus, as there they are decidedly lateral and very small, while the 

 development of the tegmina in the same sex is most marked in falcata, 

 where they are overlapping, covering all of the metanotum and the 

 greater portion of the proximal dorsal aljdominal segment. The 

 venation in the female tegmina is always generalized, being more 

 complex in falcata than in any of the other forms. 



Color Pattern. — The color pattern of all of the forms of this genus 

 is similar in several respects; first, in the possession of pale paired 

 lines extending from the eye caudad to the apex of the abdomen and, 

 second, in the general uniformity of the lateral and ventral color. 

 In the majority of the forms the color of the dorsum between the pale 




70 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



lines is more or less uniform and, for convenience in describing the 

 extent and character of the pattern, we have referred to this as the 

 dorsal color, the ventral and lateral tones as the lateral color, and the 

 pale paired lines and their developments as the pale pattern. The 

 range of tone in all three of these principal components of the colora- 

 tion is very considerable, the extreme on one hand having the pattern 

 intense, the contrasts decided and the tones darker and richer, while 

 in the other extreme the pattern is dilute, the contrasts poor and the 

 tones paler and weaker. To facilitate reference to these extremes 

 we have termed them the intensive and recessive extremes. In the 

 recessive condition the pale pattern is frequently much restricted as 

 well as weakened, while the dorsal color is often but little, in part 

 only, or not at all different from the lateral color. 



Distribution. — Extending from north-central Texas (Dallas), 

 southern New Mexico (Dry Canyon and Mesilla Valley) and central 

 southern .\rizona (Tunuimoc Hill and Sycamore Canyon), .^outh 

 to the upper Rio Balsas Valley in (luerrero, Mexico, on the west 

 reaching Tejiic and on the east the vicinity of the coast at Corpus 

 ChrLsti and Brownsville, Texas, and Tamos, Vera Cruz, Mexico. 

 Vertically the genus ranges up to at least 6500 feet (in the Davis 

 Mountains, Texas). It reaches its greatest diversity in southern' 

 Texas antl the northern and central parts of the Mexican taljlelaud. 



History. — In 1878, Brunner- erected the genus for two species then 

 described, viz., ine-riainn (froni Mexico) and cmarginnto (from Texas). 

 In 1880, Bormans' described a .species from Sciioa, .\l)yssinia, as 

 Dichopetaln massaiw, which has since been placed in the genus 

 Peropyrrhicia. which is exclusively African. Scudder, in 1000, 

 described' a Dichopetala brericauda from California, which we now 

 know to l)e an Arethcea and not at all related to Dichopetala. In 

 1901. Rehn'' described a new form from IMexico as D. pulchra, basing 

 it on material which he had previously recorded as mexicana. Scud- 

 der, in 1902. in Scudder and Cockerell's list of New Mexican Orthop- 

 tera* described as new a species of the genus from New Mexico, 

 calling it Dichopetala brevicauda, but as that name wa-s preoccupied, 

 Morse, at Scudder's suggestion, renamed the species D. brevihastata.'' 

 In 1907, Rehn described a species from Arizona as D. tern.*

The entire series of the genus examined by us numbers' 362 speci- 

 mens. The great majority of these (239) were taken by the authors 

 on recent trips and are located in the Hebard Collection and that 

 of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Of the 

 remainder of the representation we have had before us, 37 specimens 

 were from the Hebard Collection ex Brunner; 27, comprising the 

 entire series of the genus in the United States National Museum, 

 were examined through the kindness of Mr. A. N. Caudell; 50, 

 forming the entire series in the Scudder Collection, were either 

 loaned or made accessible to us by Dr. Samuel Henshaw, of the 

 Museum of Comparative Zoology, and a few specimens each were 

 loaned by the authorities of the Field Museum and the American 

 Museum of Natural History. To the above-mentioned gentlemen 

 and the authorities of these museums we wish to express our hearty 

 thanks for their assistance in the work. We have, with their co- 

 operation, been able to examine almost all of the material in America 

 on which the records of the genus were based. Aside from the 

 typical material of the two original species of the genus, no recorded 

 specimens of the group exist in other collections.

The two females before us show considerable color variation which 

 the following description covers. 



General color of the face, gense, lateral lobes of the pronotum, 

 pleura, and greater portion of the lateral aspect of the abdomen honey 

 yellow to dull green yellow, ventral aspect of the body similar but 

 inclining toward wax yellow. Dorsal aspect of pronotum, fastigium, 

 occiput, dorsum of abdomen, and dorsal portion of lateral aspects of 

 the latter brick red to claret red. Eyes buckthorn brown to raw 

 sienna, crossed obliquely by a fine seal brown line; antennje with the 

 two proximal joints largely morocco red to claret brown, remaining 

 joints of dorsal color; ventral portion of infra-ocular region, at base 

 of mandibles, with a more or less distinct blotch of claret browTi. 

 Pronotum with a pair of narrow discal lines varying from honey 

 yellow to light viridine yellow, these bordered more or less distinctly 

 on one or both (dorsal and lateral) margins by blackish lines, the pale 

 lines regularly diverging cephalad and caudad from the middle of 

 the pronotum; cephalic and caudal margins of the disk more or less 

 distinctly beaded with blackish. Tegmina with the discoidal 

 section of the color of the dorsum of the abdomen, occasionallj- washetl 

 in part with blackish; marginal field of lateral color; distal margin 

 in one specimen edged narrowly with the green of the limbs, sutural 

 region approaching the lateral color in the other .specimen. Abdomen 

 with traces of a seal brown pattern tjordering the lateral section of 

 the dorsal color, the pattern sometimes enclosing areas of the clear 

 dorsal color and again merely a line of seal brown; marginal beading 

 of segments distinct dorsad, more or less distinct laterad. Ovi- 

 positor of lateral color, more or less washed with parrot green, the 

 rufous margining e.xtending to the base on the dorsal margin' and 

 little proximad of the armed section on the ventral margin, dorso- 

 proximal section with the sulcus more or less blackish. Limbs 

 absinthe green to claret bro\\-n, proximal portion of the cephalic and 

 median femora washed with chestnut when the general color of the 




78 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



femora is green; apices of all the femora, or only the caudal femora 

 and the adjacent portion of the tibiae blackish; caudal femora proxi- 

 mad with a reticulate pattern of blackish brown on the lateral face, 

 a central line of which pattern is more or less decidedly indicated; 

 distal portion of the caudal tibiae and tarsi blackish. 



Distribuiion. — The present species is known only from two localities 

 on the slopes of the upper Rio Balsas ^'a!ley in the states of ]\Iorelos 

 and Guerrero, Mexico. The species ajjparently has a range in 

 vertical distribution extending from aljout 1900 to 5440 feet, from 

 the evidence of the two localities from which it is now kno\ra. 



Morphological Noks. — The ovipositor, as is usual in species of the 

 genus, varies somewhat in length. The subgenital plate of the 

 female shows considerable variation in the form of the distal margin, 

 ranging from the truncate type originally described, through the 

 moderately arcuato-emarginate condition found in our Cuernavaca 

 topotype, to the moderately decided and distinct obtuse-angulate 

 emarginate condition found in the Rio Cocula specimen. The 

 tegmina of the female have a certain amount of variation in the distal 

 margin of the same, this being more truncate in one of our specimen^ 

 than in the other. There is also .some little variation in the wiclth 

 of the interspace between the tegmina in the same sex. 



Si/nojiymy. — The senior author is responsible for the only synonym 

 of the present species — D. pulchra. TJic female s])ecunen on wiiich 

 that synonjTn was based was first recorded correctly- by him as 

 D. mexicana. l)ut later differences in the subgenital plate were noticed 

 which seemed of specific value, and the individual was separated as 

 D. pulchra, its closest relationship being supposed to be with I), 

 emnrginata. The apparent difference on which this separation was 

 made we now know to be untrustwortliy, ;\s the amount of com- 

 pression of the plate produces a different form in the margins of the 

 same. A certain amount of individual variation in the einargination 

 of this plate is also evident from the form of it in the three known 

 individuals of that sex. 



Remarks. — Owing to our lack of male individuals of this species, 

 the type of that .sex being unique as far as known, we have placed 

 the .species in the male key from the evidence of the original descrip- 

 tion.

Diohopetala faloata n. sp. 



This species belongs to the same section of the genus as mexicana, 

 but differs in the greater general size, the shorter limbs of the male, 

 in the tegmina being overlapping in the female, the male subgenital 

 plate being without exserted lobes, in the same portion in the female 

 being distinctly emarginate and in the greater length of the ovipositor. 

 Type: cf ; Tepic, Mexico. (Eisen.) [Hebard Collection.] 

 Description of Type. — Size quite large (for the genus); form 

 comparatively robust. Head with its greatest width contained about 

 one and one-half times in the depth; occiput well inflated, steeply 

 declivent to the very short, compressed, and sublamellate fastigium, 

 the apex of which is very bluntly recurved, very slightly separated 

 from the apex of the facial fastigium; eyes small, elliptical in outline.

 to give a few notes on the same. Caudal portion of the occiput, 

 which area is usually covered b\- the pronotum, seal brown, a very 

 fine jKistocular line of the same and sometimes a similar weak 

 medio-longitudinal line on the occiput present, the post-ocular

 proximal segments in the male narrowly edged cephalad with seal 

 brown, this portion like that similarly colored on the occiput probably 

 normally concealed; the dorsum of the abihjmen separated from the 

 •sides by a more or less distinct line, which in position is continuous 

 with the po.stocular line of the head and pronotum; caudal margin 

 of the dorsal segments in the female more or less distinctly and 

 broadly edged with darker color. Limlis more or less decidedly 

 washed with matkler brown, a slight edging of the same color on the 

 dorsal margin of the ovipositor, the terminal teeth of the same tipped 

 with seal brown.

Description of Allotype.— The following characters are solely those 

 of difference from the above description of the type, features not 

 mentioned are essentially as in the male sex. 



Size large (for the genus); form robust. Head noticeably 



broad, the greatest width nearly equal to the depth of the 



head as far as the clypeal suture; fastigium very brief, slightly 



efevated at the extreinity; eyes moderately prominent, slightly 



compressed, ovoid, their depth contained slightly more than 



one and one-half times in the depth of the infra-ocular portion 



of the gens; antennae about one and one-half times the length 



of the body. Pronotum heavy, the dorsum more arcuate in 



section than in the opposite sex, caudal

no apprecial)le callous bounding lines present on the disk, which 



rounds into the lateral lobes; transverse sulcus weakly indicated, 



placed mesad and on the middle of the disk impressed in a broad, 



\'-shaped figure; lateral lobes with the greatest depth contained 



one and two-thirds times in the dorsal length of the same, margins

 narrowly to the sutural margin. Supra-anal j^late very broad 

 trigonal, apex very blunt; cerci short, conical, distal portion slightly

In size the type represents what is the average of the entire male 

 paratypic series, practically none but the extremes measured above 

 varj'ing appreciably from the more general size. The allotype is in 

 most measurements the maximum extreme for the female sex, from 

 which the series grades rather evenly to the minimum measurements 

 given for that sex. The length of the body is an uncertain measure- 

 m^it, as it depends so largely on the stuffing of the abdomen, and, 

 while the present series was stuffed in its entirety by the authors, 

 a certain amount of variation in bulk is impossible to prevent. The 

 length of the cephalic femora, particularly in the female sex, shows 

 appreciable variation — in females of approximately the same bulk 

 measuring 7.8 and 9.2 mm. This variation is also noticed in the 

 median femora, while the tibise of the respective limbs vary propor- 

 tionately. Such variation in the length of the caudal femora as is 

 evident is of a far less degree and not disproportionate to the general 

 bulk variation. The tegmina of the male show some variation in 

 length, never being shorter than the i^ronotal length, but occasionally 

 surpassing the same. 



Color Notes — The general pattern of the male sex consists of a 

 dorsal shade covering the dorsum of the head, disk of the pronotum; 

 another covering the tegmina (aside from the marginal field and 

 region of the principal veins) ; a paler lateral color involving the face, 

 sides of head, lateral lobes of the pronotum, and sides of the abdomen; 

 an area covering the dorsal surface of the abdomen either concolorous 

 with or darker than the dorsal shade of head, pronotum and tegmina, 

 and a pair of pale, narrow postocular lines extending along the angle 



" Owing to the poor definition of the dorsum of the pronotum in the female, 

 this measurement is of less vahie than in the male, but it is here given to eover 

 relatively the same portion as that measiu-ed in the other se.K. 




94 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan.. 



of the tegmina, involving the whole marginal field of the tegmina and 

 dividing the dorsal and lateral colors of the abtlomen. The female 

 sex is so unicolorous that it has no pattern distinctive enough to 

 describe. The color of the dorsum of the head, pronotum, discoidal 

 and anal fields of the tegmina and the limbs of the male ranges from 

 yellowish oil green to cosse green," occasionally lined along the 

 internal margin of the pale lateral pronotal lines with maroon, and in 

 all thickly and more or less regularly sprinkled with very minute 

 points or stipples of the same color. Discoidal and anal fields of the 

 male tegmina varying from lettuce green to serpentine green;"'' 

 area of the principal veins (i.e., humeral trunk) more or less broadly 

 and strongly linetl with a shade varying from morocco red to maroon. 

 Paired pale lines in the male (also covering the marginal field of the 

 tegmina) varying from cream-white to light green-yellow, le.ss 

 prominent on the abdomen in some specimens than in others. Dorsal 

 color of the abdomen sometimes the same as the dorsal color of the 

 ])ron()tum, again as dark as the major portion of the tegmina, and 

 in a fair proportion ranging througii pompeian red to madder brown, 

 such broAvnish tones being due to a great increase in number of the 

 overlying stipple points of those colors, similar to the condiiion found 

 on the dorsum of the pronotum. These points are also present in 

 individuals having an apparentlj- uniform greenish dorsal tone on 

 the abdomen, but they are so few that they do not affect the general 

 shade. Lateral color in the male ranging from javel green to cosse 

 green, sulphine yellow in a single individual,"^ deneral color of 

 female varying from uniform lettuce green to snuff brown dorsad, 

 all finely and more or less thickly stippled with garnet brown to 

 maroon (one specimen), paling into court gray on the sides of head, 

 pronotum, and pleura; tegmina of the dorsal color with marginal 

 field pale and a line of maroon present on the principal veins. Pale 

 lines indicated but weakly in a few specimens on head and pronotum, 

 not present on abdomen. Limbs unicolorous with the dorsum of 

 the pronotum in both sexes. Eyes in both sexes varying from russet 

 brown to hazel, crossed obliquely dorsad of the middle by a fine line 

 of chestnut brown, which touches the caudal margin of the eye at 

 the ventral margin of the pale postocular line. Antennae in both

 apparently (hie to the stuffing and (hying, .-^o that no importance is here attached 

 to such fluctuation in the color of the dorsum of the pronotum.

" The latter shade may be due to drying, as it is found in but a single specimen.

sexes ranging from olive ochre to lime green, the proximal joints 

 more or less speckled with maroon. Tibial spines tipped with 

 black. Ovipositor of the general color tone and usually of the dorsal 

 shade, finely stippled with garnet brown and dorsal margin more or 

 less washed with same. 



Distribution. — The present species is known only from three locali- 

 ties in the arid tropical Tamaulipan region of southern Texas, 

 Brownsville, Piper Plantation (along the Rio Grande about ten 

 miles southeast by east of Brownsville), and Lyford (in the same 

 county about forty-seven miles north of Brownsville). It doubtless 

 ranges over an adjacent section of Mexico. 



Biological Notes. — At Brownisville and Piper Plantation the 

 present species was scarce and local, occurring in tangles of Clematis 

 (probably C. reticulata) growing over the ground and on low mesquite 

 and huisache. Individuals, when disturbed, endeavored to hop, 

 crawl, or drop into recesses of these vines, where they are so well 

 protected by their coloration that beating was the best method of 

 securing them. At Lyford the single specimen was taken with 

 D. gladiator in a weedy field which had a low cover of sand spur 

 {Cenchrus sp.) and grasses. This species was found to be by far the 

 least active of any of the forms of the genus taken by the authors. 



Morphological Notes. — In the female sex the interspace between 

 the tegmina varies from one extreme, in which the sutural margins 

 are touching, to one in which the space separating them is nearly 

 half of the width of a single tegmen. 



Remarks. — The possibility of confounding this very peculiar species 

 with any other form of the genus is very remote. It is interesting 

 that in a region which has been examined as often as the Brownsville 

 section, as striking a species as this should have been overlooked, for 

 which the character of its habitat is probably responsible.

100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



The variation in size appears to be purely individual aside from the 

 possible presence of a larger race at the southern extreme of the. 

 range of the species. The individuals from Victoria, Tamaulipas, 

 are of peculiar interest in this connection, the pronotum in both 

 sexes being shorter and broader than in the other specimens of the 

 species, while the legs are somewhat thicker and more robust than in 

 by far the greater portion of the Texas series, but their length pro- 

 portions are matched in other individuals. The tegmina in the 

 Victoria male are shorter and broader than in any other individual 

 of the same sex seen, the distal portion being much less produced 

 with the margin decidedly truncate. The size of the tegmina is seen 

 to vary somewhat in the female sex, the width of the interspace 

 between the two also fluctuating, but the latter is never wide enough 

 to cause any difficulty in determining the species. The Tamos 

 female is unique in its great dimensions, aside from which it is per- 

 fectly t>iiical of the species. We doubtless have here parallelism 

 to the condition of sporadic giantism found in the next species, under 

 which the matter is discussed. It is possilile that in this case the 

 variation is geographic, but our material from Mexico is too meager 

 to make any definite assertions. 



Color Xotes. — The following color notes are all based on stuffed 

 specimens, all of which, with the exception of two individuals, were 

 prepared by the authors and have retained in practically its entirety 

 the original coloration." 



The general pattern of the "male has the dorsum of the head, 

 pronotum, and abdomen dark and generally uniform, paired pale 

 lines extending from the caudal margin of the eye, marking the 

 boundaries of the disk of the i)ronotum, involving the wiiole marginal 

 field of the tegmina and present as broader lateral bars on the abdo- 

 men. The abdominal segments have pale beaded margins caudad, 

 these rarely outlined proximad with blackish. In the male the 

 general color of the venter and of the lateral aspects of the pronotum, 

 pleura, abdomen and proximal portions of the femora vary from 

 honej' yellow to jiarrot green in shade and also considerably in 

 intensity. The color of tiu' dorsum of the head, i)ronotum, and 

 abdomen in the same sex ranges from clear mahogany red through 

 nrKMs brown to nearly clear ])yrite yellow. This color is usually

purest on the disk of the pronotum, on the dorsum of the abdomen 

 being solid, bounded by the pale marginal lines on the segments, 

 frequently bisected by an adventitious pale medio-longitudinal line 

 or divided by a broad median area of the lateral color and in the 

 extreme condition only present laterad in the neighborhood of the 

 pale lines. Head of the male with the cephalic and lateral aspects 

 slightly paler than the lateral color, varying from baryta yellow to 

 chalcedony yellow, an infra-ocular bar of Indian red frequently 

 present, rarely observed, and then but faintly, in the paler specimens; 

 eyes varying from light buff to seal brown, this apparently due in 

 part to the drj'ing of the insect; antennae varying from raw sienna to 

 kaiser brown, the proximal joint in greater part of the color of the 

 face. Pronotum of male with the pale lateral lines ^'arying from 

 nearly pure white to buff yellow in one extreme and viridine yellow 

 in the other, always broader cephalad and caudad than mesad, 

 generally severed once and sometimes twice at the point of greatest 

 constriction; lateral lobes of pronotum with a trace of the dorsal 

 color present cephalad and caudad contiguous to the pale bars. 

 Tegmina of the male with the underlying color varj'ing from bay to 

 maroon, the venation and marginal field similar to the pale lateral 

 bars of the pronotum in color; base of the narrow discoidal field 

 entirely suffused with weak mahogany red or bright chestnut, the 

 pale veins of the distal portion of the same field sharply contrasted. 

 Disto-dorsal abdominal segment of the male washed with yellow, 

 varying from pale cadmium to mars yellow, the cerci wholly of the 

 same color. Cephalic and median femora of the male with more or 

 less of their length ochraceous-orange, occasionally green without 

 any of the former color; cephalic and median tibiae with green the 

 underlying color, more or less suffused with ochraceous-orange or 

 occasionally (Victoria, Tamaulipas, specimens only) almost wholly 

 blackish, the region of the tj'mpanum almost invariablj^ (but a single 

 exception) touched dorsad with blackish. Caudal femora of male 

 with the proximal three-fifths parrot green'* with a medio-lateral 

 stippled pattern of blackish; distal extremity of femora blackish 

 brown of variable intensity, rarely very weak, remainder of distal 

 two-fifths of the femora varying, with the general tone, from mustard 

 yellow to zinc orange. Caudal tibiae of male with their ventral color 

 agreeing with the yellowish distal portion of the femora, but dorsad 



1' Even in the specimens with honey-yellow lateral aspects (Victoria, Tamauli- 

 pas) the femora are parrot green, which would lead one to the conclusion that 

 green was the natural coloration of the greater portion of the whole insect.

more or less washed with blackish brown, verj- strongly and decidedly 

 so in the Victoria, Tamaulipas, pair. The type is of a well-contrasted 

 color form only surpassed in intensity by the Victoria individuals. 



The stuffed Victoria, Tamaulipas, female is practically a color 

 tluplicate of the male from that locality, the following comments 

 being based on the remainder of the stuffed females. 



The general pattern of coloration of the females differs from the 

 pattern of th(> male only in that the pale lateral lines are not indicated 

 on the tegmiua and the beaded character of the marginal coloration 

 (if the dorsal alxlominal segments is less frecjuent. The lateral and 

 ventral color of the females is, in the stuffed individuals, always 

 green, varying from light yellow-green to parrot green. The dorsal 

 color as indicated in the male is rarely develojied at all in the female, 

 and then mostly indicated only on part of the pronotum and (>xtreme 

 lateral sections of the dorsum of the abdomen. .\ narrow medio- 

 limgitudinal line varying from victoria lake to english red is indicated 

 more or less distinctly on a part or all of the ])r(inotum in a portion 

 of the females, while in One six'cinicn tiie dorsum of the i)ronotum is 

 weakly suffused with tin' last-mentioned color. Head of the female 

 colored as in the opposite se.\, but antenna' ranging from oil yellow 

 to mars yellow. Pronotum of the female with the lateral lobes 

 colored as in the male; the usual i)al(' lateral lines of the pronotum 

 are subobsolete in about half of the specimens, being indicated on 

 the head in several which have them almost lacking on the pronotum. 

 Tegmina of the female varying from cream white to baryta yellow- 

 the interstices of the dorsal section occasionally slate color, the median 

 section jiroximad with a variable but always weak narrow line of 

 hay's russet. Abdomen of the female with the lateral pale lines 

 washed with the lateral color as in the male, occasionally very weak, 

 sometimes relatively broad antl frequently with the portion on each 

 individual segment roughly elongate trigonal. Ovipositor passing 

 from courge green at the iiase to ivy green at the apex, wa.shed along 

 tiie dorsal margin with the color of the median line of the dorsum of 

 the pronotum when that line is present; teeth of the ovipositor 

 pitch brown. Limbs of the female varying from a tyi)e like that of 

 the majority of the males to one in which they are practically course 

 or light bice green, the pattern of the external face of the caudal 

 femora always, although often very faintly, indicated. The presence 

 of the blackish near the tymi)anum of the cephalic tibiip is exceptional 

 and not the rule in the female. 



The allotype is about midway iu'twecn the extremes here de- 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 103 



scribed, having a short median line on the pronotum, very weak 

 incomplete pale pronotal lines and practically uniform limbs, without 

 blackish near the tympanum of the cephalic tibiae. 



The Victoria, Tamaulipas, individuals stand apart from the other 

 specimens, having an intensified pattern surpassing in contrast 

 anything else belonging to the species seen by us. Certain structural 

 peculiarities may compel the separation of these, as a distinct race, 

 at a later date when more Mexican material is accessible, so that the 

 following comments do not include them. The female from Maverick 

 County has a very intensive coloration, with the dorsum of the 

 pronotum and lateral portions of the dorsum of the abdomen suffused 

 with garnet brown. The Laguna del Gato series is as a rule weaker 

 in color contrasts than Uvalde, Del Rio and Mission individuals of 

 both sexes, the type alone excepted. San Antonio specimens stand 

 about intermediate in color intensity. That color is of little geo- 

 graphic significance is sho^vn by the fact that the two lots taken 

 closest together (about eighteen miles apart), i.e., Laguna del Gato 

 and Mission, arc nearly as widely divergent as any examined. 



Distribution. — The range of this species extends from an undeter- 

 mined point on the Pecos River, probably near the New Mexican 

 line,'^ east to the vicinity of Corpus Christi and south as far as 

 Tamos, Vera Cruz, Mexico. Aside from the uncertain Pecos record 

 and that from Tamos, the range of the species is approximately 

 co-extensive with the area called the Rio Grande Plain by Bray.^ 

 While the Pecos locality is more elevated, the highest points at which 

 we have noted the species (Del Rio and Uvalde) are at an elevation 

 of 1,100 feet, while the Corpus Christi and Tamos individuals were 

 taken almost at sea-level. It is probable that the Victoria, Tamauli- 

 pas, specimens were taken at a higher elevation than 1,100 feet, but 

 we have no definite information to this effect, the general region, 

 however, being near the 500 meter (approximately 1,640 feet) con- 

 tour. At ^Mission the species was taken just below the line of gravel 

 hills, while the Laguna del Gato series was taken in these hills. . At 

 Del Rio and Uvalde it occurred on the rolling plateau country, while 



^' The data with this specimen is "Pecos, Aug. 18." As the specimen came 

 to Scudder through Uhler, we can, judging by analogy with other specimens 

 similarly credited bj' Scudder, probably consider it one of Capt. Pope's collecting. 

 Capt. Pope's camps along the Pecos reached from above the New Mexican line 

 to considerably below the .same, but the dates were all in March. The specimen 

 is in pOor shape, having been dried from a liquid preseri'ative. It is possible, 

 however, that the specimen was taken much later near the present town of 

 Pecos, Texas. 



■'oBottin. Gazeile, XXXII, p. 116, fig. 6. 




104 • PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



at San Antonio it was taken in the hilly country immediately north 

 of the city. Tamos, the southern limit of the species, is near Tampico, 

 on the Rio Panuco, in the extreme northern part of Vera Cruz. 



Biological Notes. — At Laguiia del tJato the jiresent species was 

 taken on a low, very green rhamnaceous shruli (prol)ab]y Condalia 

 obovata), where it was common locally. At JMi.ssion five individuals 

 were heard at night in bushes, several as much as five feet from the 

 ground. At San Antonio the species was very local, not at all 

 common and hard to find in a low, stout, green rhamnaceous bush. 

 On the hill slopes at Uvalde it occurred on the low Acacia berlan- 

 landieri, which there replaced the ubiquitous mesquitc, while at the 

 foot of the hills it was taken on tall rank green weeds. On tlie 

 Del Rio hills, which were clothed with low Acacia, numerous other 

 thorny bushes, occasional arborescent yuccas, and several species of 

 Opunlia, the present species was .secured in catclaw {Mimosa sp.) 

 and other thorny bushes. The specimens taken by Pratt at San 

 Antonio were from Opantia lindheimeri, while at Corpus Christi and 

 in Maverick County it occurred on plants of the same genus. 

 . Synonymy. — The erroneous determination of the species as breri- 

 haslata by Hunter, Pratt and Mitchell, we have correct etl i)y an ex- 

 amination of the original material. 



Remarks. — The most striking diagnostic characters of this species 

 are, the abbreviate subgenital plate of the male and the combinatiou 

 of a short ovipositor ami the narrow interspace l)etwceii the tegmiiia 

 in the female. The latter space iiever equals tiie width, and rarely 

 as much as half the width, of a single tegmen. The male subgenital 

 plate is seen, when compared with that of brerihnslatn. to be broader, 

 not at all produced inesad, except tliat the plate is in general narrowed 

 in that direction, the distal margin is \'-emarginate iiies:td with 

 slight subtruncate .sections laterad, which are flanked at the angles 

 with very short blunt subobsolete tul)ercles. The cercus has (lie 

 extremity more acute than in brevihasfata, also more elongate, with 

 the character of the median tooth slightly different. The ovipositor 

 has tlie ventral margin striiighter, »he ]iroxiiual depth less in propor- 

 tion to that of the apex and the apex slightly more acute. The more 

 ovate eye is immediately apparent on coiiijiarison.

probably due to the same being taken from diflferent pointa, that of the cephalic 

 femur on account of hLs measurement including the coxa, but the pronotal 

 difference is incomprehen-siblo to us. The only explanation which .scema at all 

 likely is that the length wa-s taken along the lateral angles of the disk instead of 

 along the median line, iis we are accustomed to take the latter measurement to- 

 get the maximum.

From the above measurements it is evident that considerable 

 variation, both geographic and individual, is present in this species. 

 The geographic evidence shows that material from southern Arizona 

 and the elevated portions of western Texas averages smaller than 

 the series from southern Texas (Laguna del Gato) and Coahuila,. 

 Mexico, jiarticularly in the femoral length. The Jaral, Coahuila, 

 females are not, however, of the same general proportions as the 

 Montelovez, Coahuila, specimens of that sex, and, although we are 

 unable to locate the latter locality, (lossilily altitude may be respon- 

 sible, Jaral Ix'ing near the four-thousand-foot contour line. It is 

 possible that the character of cover and richness of same may i)c a 

 factor in determining the amount of geographic variation. The 

 individual variation is considerable in all of the series, i)Ut the only 

 really puzzling feature is the occurrence of large females with heavy 

 pronoti. In the Montelovez series these are more numerous (thnn- 

 out of four) than elsewhere, but th? ])aratypic female from Mcsilla 

 Park and to a lesser degree the Uvalde specimen are of this type. 

 This point is treated in greater detail under Remarks.

amount of variation in intensity of color pattern and color tone. 

 The pattern is considerably recessive and intensive in the male, but 

 m the female the recessive extreme is even greater than in the male, 

 although the intensive is not as decided. The normal pattern aJ 

 found in both sexes is as follows: a dorsal color involving the occiput^ 

 fastigium, dorsum of pronotum, and dorsal surface of the abdomen! 

 pale postocular bars extending to the dorsal base of the cerci; a 

 lateral and ventral color involving face, gense, lateral lobes of prono- 

 tum, pleura, and lateral and ventral aspects of abdomen. In intensive 

 individuals the dorsal color is decidedly darker than the lateral and 

 ventral color, in average individuals in part at least so, in recessive 

 mdividuals nearly (cT) or quite (9) similar in tone. Strongly 

 intensive individuals generally have the distal extremity of the caudal 

 femora infuscate, but this is not a rule, as occasionally average and 

 rarely moderately recessive individuals have this marking present. 



Male. Dorsal color ranging from ochraceous tawny and sudan 

 brown to claret lirown and maroon, solid and uniform on head and 

 pronotum, generally restricted to the lateral sections of the dorsum 

 of the abdomen and in intensive individuals blackish next to the 

 pale lateral lines, the distal margins of the abdominal segments edged 

 with the pale color of the lateral bars, this edging subobsolete in the 

 recessive specimens and narrowing mesad in all, a more or less 

 distinct dark beading characterizing the same margins. Pale lateral 

 bars ranging from cream white to very pale orange yellow always 

 indicated in the male. Lateral and ventral color ranging from cream 

 buff and pinkish buff to brownish olive, the green complimentary 

 phase ranging to civette green. Face in the extreme green condition 

 with broad paired vertical bars of tha pale color of the lateral bars 

 placed ventrad of the eyes and antennal bases, the median pair weakly • 

 continued to the clypeus; eyes varying from cameo brown to bay; 

 antennae varying from raw sienna and mars yellow to madder brown,' 

 weaker distad. Lateral lobes of the pronotum with a broad margin 

 of the pale lateral color on the ventral and greater portion of the 

 caudal margin, the dorsal section of the lateral lobes washed more or 

 less with the dorsal color; pale paired lines more or less severed at 

 the median sulcus. Tegmina with the marginal field of the color of 

 the pale lines; region of the humeral trunk varying from orange 

 rufous to morocco red; remainder of tegmina with the base color 

 blackish brown, the venation of the same tones as the pale lines. 

 Limbs of the lateral color more or less washed with the dorsal color, 

 in intensive individuals decidedly so, the blackish-brown infuscation 




112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



of the distal extremity of the caudal femora (when present) being 

 generally correlated with a similar infuscation of the dorsal face of 

 the caudal tibis, the caudal femora, which are infuscate distad. 

 having the adjacent section of the distal half more or less inclined 

 toward tawny or yellow ochre. Pattern of caudal femora always 

 present. 



Female. Dorsal surface varying from being concolorous with 

 the lateral color through buffy citrine to russet, the intensive type 

 having the abdominal coloration largely produced by stipplings. 

 The segments of the abdomen in these contrasted specimens are 

 marked as in the male, but with decided blackish lateral i^atches 

 which extend more or less toward the median line proximad on each 

 segment. Color of the pale lines (when present) varying from 

 cream white to pale lumiere green and warm buff. Lateral color 

 varying from clay color (in this specimen jiale chalcedony yellow on 

 head and pronotum) through course green to hellebore green, the 

 extreme recessive green condition being without distinct pale margins 

 to the lateral lobes and having the whole coloration uniform except 

 for a darkening of the di.stal margins of the ovipositor. Eyes and 

 antenniB as in tiie male. Limbs varying as in the male, but in the 

 recessive green type uniform with the general coloration and with 

 the paginal pattern weak. Tegmina varying from a type nearly 

 uniform with the lateral color, to one with the costal and distal 

 margins of the color of the pale lines, humeral trunk claret Itrown 

 and remainder blackish browji with pale venation. Ovipositor 

 varying from uniform with mass color' (recessive green and brown 

 types) with margin^: edged distad with clove brown to lila<'kish brown 

 to elm green washed dorsad with hazel and teeth blackish (extreme 

 intensive typ(>). 



(ieograi)hically considered, the coloration of the species shows 

 plasticity in some localities and constaney in (it hers. The .\rizona 

 and New Mexico individuals arc all more or less recessive, the large 

 Laguna del (lato series decidedly so, while the ^hirathon series is 

 about evenly divided (recessive, intermediate, and intensive). The 

 .five Garden Sjirings adults are eliiefly intensive, as are four of the 

 five .Kent individuals. The I'valde and I.,aredo specimens are 

 recessive, while the Beeville and Gregory representatives are average. 

 The Montelovez and Jaral individuals are almost all intensively 

 colored. 



From the ba.sis of the .\rizona, Marathon, Kent, Garden Springs, 

 and Laguna del (Jato series it seems possible that direct and reflected 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 113 



light may be a factor in determining the intensity of the color pat- 

 tern, the percentage of intensive specimens being greatest from those 

 localities known to u.s where the cover is densest, more light resistant 

 and the surface conditions less favorable for reflecting light. 



Distribution. — This species has the widest distribution of any in 

 the genus, its range extending from southern New Mexico (Sacra- 

 mento Mts.), south to .southern Coahuila, Mexico (Jaral), west to 

 the Baboquivari Mts., central southern Arizona, and east to the 

 Texas coast at Gregory (San Patricio Co.). Its vertical range is 

 from practically sea-level at the last-mentioned locality to as high 

 as 4,800 feet in the Sacramento Mountains. Its zonal range appears 

 to be entirely Lower Sonoran. As far as known, it does not extend 

 into the region of the Edwards Plateau in central Texas and does 

 not occur in the mountains of Trans-Pecos, Texas. Scudder in his 

 original description stated that he had specimens from Mexico, this 

 proliably referring to the Montelovez specimens examined by us, as 

 these were contained in his collection. 



Biological Notes. — The present species was fairly numerous on 

 creosote-bush {Covillea tridentata) at Dry Canyon, Sacramento 

 Mountains, New Mexico, and occurred on the same plant onTumamoc 

 Hill, Arizona, while at the latter locality it was also found on the 

 grountl in short, dry, yellow grass. On the slopes of Sycamore Canyon, 

 Baboquivari Mountains, Arizona, it also occurred in grasses and was 

 taken from Acacia sp. At Marathon, Texas, it was generally common 

 in various low bushes and grasses, the males, particularly, often 

 sprawled out in a loose manner somewhat reminding one of phalangids 

 or harvest-men, while at Kent and Garden Springs it occurred in 

 similar situations. At Beeville and Uvalde it was taken from green 

 weedy plants, at Gregory it was found in the green tangle about a 

 mesquite clump, while it was beaten from a low bush on a sandy 

 slope at Laredo. At Laguna del Gato it was taken rather commonly 

 with D. castanea on a low, very green rhamnaceous shrub (probably 

 Condalia obovata). 



A correlation of the dates on the present series brings out some 

 very interesting points on the time of maturity of the species. The 

 earliest dates on which adults were secured are July 28 at Beeville, 

 July 30 at Gregory, August 6 at Laguna del Gato, August 7 at Mesilla, 

 August 10-12 at Laredo, and August 16 at Mesilla. At Dry Canyon, 

 New Mexico (elevation 4,800 feet), on July 13 nymphs not more than 

 half grown were riot uncommon, while at Marathon and Garden 

 Springs on August 26-27 and September 2, respectively, nothing but 

 8 




114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



nymphs were seen, while on September 11 both nymphs and adults 

 were taken at Garden Springs, and adults outnumbered the nymphs 

 at Marathon on September 12-13. From this it is apparent that 

 in the low, warmer Rio Grande Plain and interior valleys (Mesilla) 

 the species matures at least a month earlier than in the higher regions 

 of the plateau. The latest date is November 1-3 at Jaral, Coahuila. 



Morphological A'otes. — The subgenital plate of the male varies in 

 the depth of the emargination of the distal margin and also in the 

 degree of acuteness of the flanking angles of the same, in some exam- 

 ples these latter being quite acute and in others apprecialily rounded. 

 The ovipositor varies slightly, almost inappreciably, in general 

 curvature of the margins and little in length, but the relative depth 

 varies very decidedly, particularlj- in all of the [Mexican specimens, 

 which, however, are almost or quite equalled in this respect by 

 individuals of the sex from Kent and Garden Springs. The lateral 

 angles of the subgenital plate of the female vary in the degree of 

 angulation, in one extreme being practically rectangulate, in the 

 other with subspiniform extremities. While this latter variation 

 is frequently correlated with that in the depth of the ovipositor, the 

 rectangulate type with the deeper ovipositor, the more spiniform 

 type with the narrower ovipositor, this relationship is not at all 

 absolute. 



Synonymy. — By an unfortunate lapse, Scudder, when originally 

 describing this species, applied to it the same name (Dichopetala 

 brevicauda) that he had given two years previously to a species now 

 known to belong to the genus Arethwa, as explained by Morse who 

 renamed the present form. The name brerihastata, jiroposed by 

 Morse to replace the preoccupied brcricatida, cannot, in our opinion, 

 be credited to Scudder, notwithstanding Morse's statement that the 

 name was suggested by him, as the note is entirely by Morse without 

 a direct quotation from Scudder. The naming of a species by proxy 

 does not seem possible under present-day rules. In the same paper 

 in which the last D. brevicauda was described, Scudder and Cockerell 

 recorded D. cmnrginnta from Mesilla Park on Atriplcx. a locality and 

 situation from whicli they, a few lines lielow, described brevicauda. 

 There are no sjjecimens in the Scudder Collection labelled emarginala 

 from Mesilla Park or in the National Museum, and Prof. Cockerell 

 can give me no ad<litional information. In view of the.se facts and 

 also that true emarginala is not found within hundreds of miles of 

 that locality, as far as known only brcribastalfi occurring in that 

 region, it seems perfectly logical to a-ssume that tlie determination 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



of Mesilla material as belonging to two species is due to a compilation 

 of determinations made at different times, one before the recognition 

 of brevihastata , and that both records relate to the same species. 



The species D. hcvis, erected by the senior author on a single 

 female, is a sj-nonym of the present species. The peculiarities of the 

 ovipositor of the type of Icevis, the unarmed margins of which sug- 

 gested the specific name, we now know are due to the immaturity 

 of the individual. The latter is in the stage immediately preceding 

 maturity and its proper relationship to the other material now in 

 hand is very evident. The more robust character of the limbs and 

 smaller size of the type of Icevis are similarly explained. 



Remarks. — The variation in the length of the pronotum as found 

 in certain females has been touched upon above under the measure- 

 ments, this being the most decided fluctuation from the more general 

 type found in the species. After considerable study and considera- 

 tion from different view points, we have concluded that this phase 

 cannot be separated from the more typical one of brevihastata, that 

 it is a fluctuation occurring anj'where in the range of the species, 

 although more numerous in certain regions than in others, and is 

 approached by a few specimens not tj^pical of the same and again 

 not exactly similar to the type of brevihastata. There is, of course, 

 a possibility that future work may show the advisability of recogl^izing 

 the larger pronotum type as distinct, but we do not feel that the 

 necessary evidence will be forthcoming.

The present form is closely related to the following species, D. 

 emnrginata Brunner, from which, however, it can easily be separated 

 by the more ample tegmina of the male, the more longitudinal 

 lateral lobes of the pronotum of the same sex, the less crassate tooth 

 to the male cercus, the less deeply and sharply angulato-emarginate 

 apex of the suligenital plate of the same sex, the proportionatelj' 

 longer limbs of both sexes and the much longer, slenderer, and more 

 arcuate ovipositor.

Males from Wades, Cotulla,and Carrizo Springs have^the pronotum 

 slightly longer, tegmina slightly shorter, and femora very slightly 

 shorter than Lyford males. Females from Carrizo Springs have the 

 general size slightly less, the pronotum appreciably longer and 

 ovipositor distinctly longer than in Lyford individuals of the same 

 sex. The most striking variation in measurements is in the length 

 of the ovipositor, which varies geographically more than individually, 

 the Carrizo Springs females having this actually and proportionately 

 far exceeding the measurement of the Lyford specimens. 



Color Xotes. — The following notes have been based wholly on 

 material which was stuffed in the field or which we have every reason 

 to believe has retained its original coloration. The recessive and 

 intensive extremes are considerably different— in fact, decidedly 

 different in the male sex. Instead of describing a dorsal and lateral 

 color, it seems best in the present species to speak of the tones as a 

 general color, a pronotal wash, a pale pattern, and an abdominal 

 infuscation. 



General color of male varying from cinnamon buff to yellow ochre, 

 passing in certain individuals to apple green. The pronotal wash 

 varies from uniform with the general color through sanford's brown 

 to claret brown, the area covered by the same consisting of the 

 occiput, disk of the pronotum, more or less of the dorso-cephalic and 

 dorso-caudal portions of the lateral lobes of the same, the tegminal 

 humeral trunk and more or less of the discoidal field and vicinity 

 of the anal vein of the tegmina. The pale pattern consists of the 

 usual postocular bars outlining the disk of the pronotum, the greater 

 portion of the margins of the lateral lobes, the marginal field of the 

 tegmina, paired lateral bars on the abdomen, transverse edgings on 




122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



the segments of the same, and an adventitious mecho-longitudinal 

 abdominal thread. The tone of this pattern varies from barita 

 yellow (in the recessive extreme where it is very poorly contrasted) 

 to l:)uff yellow, in the generally greenish individuals running to 

 Avhitish with the transverse edgings of the abdominal segments cendre 

 green. The abdominal infuscation varies in intensity with the 

 general condition of the coloration, in the extreme recessive condition 

 being absent and in the other extreme covering the entire dorsum of 

 the abdomen (except for the medio-longitudinal thread) and the 

 dorsal portion of the lateral faces of the same, between which types 

 are regular graduations in the dorsal width of this shade, the lateral 

 patches decreasing in size toward the average and recessive condition. 

 The tone of this infuscation is always blackish. Eyes varying from 

 terra cotta to vandyke brown; antennic lightly more intense than 

 the general color. Pronotum with the pale borders of the lateral 

 lobes somewhat variable in widtli. Tegmina with the greater portion 

 of the anal field and much of the discoidal field with the base color 

 varying from wood browai to seal bro\\ii. the venation and a large 

 ])r()ximal patch on the anal field varying from sul])hinc yellow to raw 

 sienna, frequently more or less washed with greenish. Abdomen 

 with a dorsal medio-longitudinal bar of from sulphine yellow to 

 anti(]ue lirown in those six'cimens apjjroaching the intensive extreme 

 which have the dorsum of the abdomen not .solidly infumate, the 

 lucdio-longitudinal thread of the pale pattern of course dividing this 

 bar; segments witli the i)ale pattern edging narrowing mesad, 

 luuailrst where they bisect the lateral liars of the same pattern, in 

 the intensive extreme a suggestion of beading of the same margin 

 is due to the breaking of the pigment into regular though subeon- 

 tiguous patches; disto-dorsal abdominal segment varying from deep 

 <-hrome to sanford's brown; cerci and subgenital jilate ranging from 

 dec]) chrome to orange rufous. C'e])lKilic and median limbs of the 

 general color, more or less suffused with orange rufous distad on the 

 femora and all of the tibi;e, the latter in the int<'nsive condition 

 becoming blackish iirown distad. In one of the recessive specimens 

 the cephalic and median femora are dusky olive green distad. Caudal 

 femora of the general color, pattern always distinctly indicated, 

 the distal extremity always with a blackish area occupying al)OUt 

 one-.seventh the femoral length, the di.stal half otherwise varying 

 from light orange yellow to mars yellow, passing into the color of 

 the i)roximal half; caudal tibia? more or less lieeply and almost wholly 

 suffused with l)lackish brown, with a brief genicular section of the 

 general color. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 123 



Female with the general color varying from suli:)hine yellow to 

 ■cosse green, the dorsum of the abdomen in intensive individuals 

 ranging to dilute raw sienna. The pronotal wash is only indicated 

 in the extreme intensive condition, never as extensive as in the male 

 and only solid on the occiput and the cephalic half of the pronotal 

 disk. Pale pattern in the extreme recessive type but faintly indicated 

 on the head and pronotum, in the extreme intensive condition much 

 as in the male, but the transverse edgings to the abdominal segments 

 are narrower and decidedly beaded by blackish intervals. Marginal 

 field of tegmina always solidly whitish. Abdominal infuscation 

 represented only in intensive specimens by blackish areas of variable 

 size placed dorso-laterad at the bases of the segments. Antennae 

 varying from apricot yellow to ochraceous orange. Ovipositor of 

 the general color, strongly olive green distad, edged there with 

 Ijlackish brown, the dorsal margin of proximal half washed with 

 raw sienna. Limbs of general color, in the intensive extreme ap- 

 proaching viridian green proximad on caudal femora, distad on same 

 sulphine yellow, distal infuscation usually present only in the inten- 

 sive individuals;-^ tibiae of the general color, distal extremity of the 

 same and tarsi touched with buffy brown. 



The type is an average male, while the allotype is an extremely 

 intensive female. In the Lyford series we have both extremes in 

 both sexes and every intermediate, so it is evident that the color 

 variation has no geographic significance. 



Distribution. — This large species is known from seven localities 

 in the Rio Grande Plain of Texas {vide Bray), its range extending 

 east to Corpus Christi, south to Lyford, north to Wades and CotuUa, 

 and northwest to Carrizo Springs. Its distribution probably 

 extends south of the Rio Grande into Mexico, but we have no material 

 from that country. Its vertical distribution is limited, extending 

 from or near sea-level at Corpus Christi and Lyford to about seven 

 hundred and fifty feet at Carrizo Springs. 



Biolocjicfd Notes. — The present .species, from data on the specimens, 

 was taken on cotton at San Diego (nymphal individuals) and on 

 prickly pear {Opuntia) at Hebbronville and Alice. At Lyford we 

 found the species fairly common but somewhat local in fields of high 

 weeds, which had a low cover of sand spur (Cenchrus) and grasses. 

 Its stridulation, which was heard at night and with the aid of which 

 specimens were taken, is very faint. 



-5 One exception, a recessive female from Lyford has them indicated. 




124 PROCEEDINSS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JaU.,. 



The material from San Diego taken April 30 is all nymphal, while 

 at Carrizo Springs nymphs were taken in ]May and adults only in. 

 June. At Wades and CotuUa adults were taken May 21 and 12, 

 respectively, while at Lyford, August 6-7, but a few nymphs were 

 secured, although the adults were numerous. At Hebbronville the 

 species was pairing Augu.st 29. 



Morphological Xotes. — In the male there is some variation in the 

 relative size of the tegmina and some slight differences in the character 

 of the margin of the median lobe of the cerci, but the variation in the 

 genitalia of that sex, including the distal margin of the subgenital 

 plate, is extremely slight. The really noteworthy feature in the 

 form variation is that of the ovipositor, as it varies some in form as 

 well as dimensions. The even curve of the latter is appreciably 

 flattened mesad in certain individuals. This latter condition, how- 

 ever, is never decided enough to cause the ventral margin to appear 

 wholly or in part straight. The caudal margin of the disk of the 

 pronotum varies in the female from truncate to sliglitly but dis- 

 tinctly arcuate. 



Synonymy. — The misidentifications of this species, first as D. 

 emarginnta by Rehn in 1901, and second by Hunter, Pratt and 

 Mitchell in 1912 as D. emarginata and in part as hrcvihastnta, we art' 

 able to correct, having the material before us. The first error can 

 be explained by the absence of any material for comparison of tiie 

 closely allied cmarginuUi, while the same roa^on was (loul>tless respon- 

 sible for its determination as brmihastata, only fcinaie intlividuais 

 having been at hand, aside from an alcohoHc male from llclibronviile. 



Remarks. There exists a ixissihility that the ac(|uisiti()n of more 

 material from the western i)art of the range of the s]ieci(-; may make 

 desirable the separation of a western race based on the more elongate 

 ovipositor, but our present representation is too limited to convince 

 us of the desirability of that action. This form is complemental to 

 D. emarginata, living in the main in a (JlfTcrent region althougii in 

 much the same situations.

therein. It is quite evident tJiat considerable individual variation 

 is present in the species, this being pronouncetl in the Dallas repre- 

 sentation, which is the only series of any size. Too little material 

 is available to consider possible geographic variation in size. 



Color Notes. — But two of the specimens before us have been stuffed, 

 these (both males) forming the basis of most of the following notes. 

 As usual there is a dorsal color, a lateral color, and paired pale lateral 

 lines in the male, while in the female the dorsal and lateral colors are 

 nearly or quite uniform and the pale lines hardly or but weakly 

 indicated. 



Lateral and ventral color of male ranging from lumiere green to 

 apple green, in unstuffed specimens ranging to old gold. Dorsal 

 color consisting of an overlying tint ninning from chestnut through 

 burnt sienna to orange rufous (in unstuffed specimens), covering the 

 lateral portions of occiput, all or nearly all of disk of pronotum and 

 lateral portions of dorsum of abdomen. Pale paired lines in male 

 e.xtendiug from eye to base of cercus, ranging from pale viridine 

 yellow to creamy white. Head with fastigium and occiput bearing 

 a narrow medio-longitudinal line of the color of the pale lines, finely 

 bordered with lines of the dorsal color; eyes ochraceous tawny to liver 

 brown, crossed obliquely by an irregular slightly darker line. Prono- 

 tum in some specimens with the color dilute caudo-laterad, in tone 

 ajiproaching the lateral color, the pure dorsal color being restricted 

 to a median band; lateral lobes more or less suffused dorso-caudad 

 with the dorsal color; ventral margins edged with the color of the 

 pale lateral lines. Tegmina with the marginal field of the color of 

 the pale lateral lines, humeral trunk chestnut, discoidal field and 

 large jmrt of the anal field l)lackish brown, the venation varying 

 from buff yellow to neva green, the latter tone only present on the 

 discoidal field, the venation of the proximal half of anal field in all 

 specimens approaching buff yellow. Dorsum of abdomen with the 

 median section very close to the lateral color, the margins of all the 

 segments finely and closely beaded with the dorsal color on an 

 edging of the tone of the pale lateral bars. Limbs with the femora of 

 the lateral color, distad becoming infuscate with ochraceous-orange, 

 the tibiae entirely of the latter color; cephalic tibite with the vicinrty 

 of the foramina narrowly lined with blackish, a disto-genicular area 

 on the median tWnse more or less marked with the same, tarsi of the 

 same limbs more or less clouded with bone brown.. Caudal femora 

 with distal eighth more or less solidly blackish brown, pattern on 

 external face more or le-ss distinct in all, medio-longitudinal in 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



position; caudal tilnse more or less completely infuscate with bone 

 brown. 



General color of female (unstuffed specimens) olive ochre to honey 

 yellow, finely punctulate with maroon, these punctulations thickest 

 on the dorsmii of the abdomen and practically absent from the face, 

 gense, and lateral lobes of the pronotum. Limbs varying from 

 uniform apple green to the general color, more or less suffused with 

 Vandyke l)rown. Pale lateral bars hardly indicated or weak in the 

 female, tegmina almost wholly of the same tone. Ovipositor of the 

 general color, suffused distad with sepia to browTiish black. 



Distribution. — The range of this species covers a considerable area 

 of Texa-s south and east of the Edwards Plateau and plateau plains, 

 being known from four localities, viz., Dallas, Gregory, Beeville, and 

 Uvalde. Dallas constitutes the northern and ea.stern limit of its 

 knowTi range, Gregory the southern, and Uvakle the western. The 

 vertical range of the species is from practically sea-level at Gregory 

 to eleven hundred feet elevation at Uvalde. 



Biological Notes. — All we know regarding the habits, etc., can be 

 taken from our own notes, based on the capture of three specimens. 

 At Gregory we obtained the species from a green tangle about a 

 mcsquite clump, where D. brevihastata was also secured; at Beeville 

 it occurred in weeds near a tangle of low vine-covered bushes, while 

 at Uvalde it occurred with D. castanea on Acacia berlandieri growing 

 on the low hill slopes. . 



Morphological Notes, — The^male cerci seem to be very constant in 

 form, but the distal margin of the male subgenital plate shows 

 considerable variation, in .some specimens (Dallas) considerably 

 approximating D. gladiator in this respect, from which species, 

 however, cereal and other characters readily separate them. This 

 variation is due to a certain amount of pla-sticity in the shape of this 

 margin, which ranges from distinctly rectangulate emarginate (a.s It 

 is in the majority of specimens) to a tj^ie which has the angulation 

 obtuse with the lateral angles much more roundeii than in the 

 typical form. 



In the female the ovipositor shows some variation in the straight- 

 ne.ss of the ventral margin, this being slightly arcuate in three Dallas 

 individuals, but this arcuation is not as decided a.s in gladiator, the 

 general form and robustness of the ovipositor being different from 

 that found in the latter. In two Dallas females the tegmina are 

 hardly visible Ijeyond the pronotum, but the specimens are unques- 

 tionably adult. The tegmina project .slightly caudad of the adjacent 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 131 



(lateral) margins, but not (or hardly) caudacl of the dorsal margin 

 of the pronotum (caiulal margin of disk). 



Remarks. — There can be little doubt of the correctness of associ- 

 ating Brunner's name with this species, as apparent discrepancies 

 between the description and present material seem to be entirely 

 color differences or else due to a different conception of terms and the 

 relativity of such. The evidence we have of the probable source of 

 the original material and locality of the same assists one consideralily 

 in locating the species, as but one form of the genus is, so far as 

 known, found in the Dallas region.

Closely related to but a single species — D. catinata {vide infra) — 

 from which it can immediately be separated by the lobe of the male 

 cercus having the margins converging distad, by the ventral margin 

 of the same with a distinctly indicated longitudinal cingulum, the 

 narrower subgenital plate of the male, which has the lateral margins 

 subparallel distad, and by the more ample tegmina in the same sex, 

 while in the female sex the ventral margin of the lateral lobes are 

 straighter in, the present species, the ovipositor is more elongate, 

 with the dorsal margin more regularly arcuate and the distal teeth 

 of same more numerous, and the apices of the subgenital plate 

 spiniform, while in both sexes the eyes are less prominent in oreaeca.

From the very small size of the Montelovez female it would seem 

 that at the southern end of its known range the species is quite under 

 the proportions of Texan specimens, although it is best to make such 

 a statement guardedly, as it would appear from the evidence of the 

 Texan material that size variation is, in large part at least, individual. 

 In the Texan series our individual lots are not of sufficient size to be 

 really comparable, although the Marathon female appreciably exceeds 

 individuals of the same sex taken at higher elevations, while in the 

 male sex the measurements so overlap in the Chisos and Davis series 

 +hat the differences appear to be purely individual. Probably a 

 series from Marathon would show as much size variation as similar 

 representations from other localities. 



Color Notes. — The intensive and recessive extremes of this species 

 are considerably different, the latter being more decided in the 

 female than in the male. The components of the pattern are the 

 usual dorsal latero-ventral, and pale pattern colors, the first two 

 being wholly or in large part indistinguishable in the recessive females, 

 the pale pattern almost completely lacking in the same and weaker 

 than usual in recessive males. In the more or less intensive males 

 and females the pale pattern is very broad, in fact broader than in 

 any of the other forms of the genus. 



Dorsal color in recessive males limited to the sides of the dorsum 

 of the head, cephalic two-thirds of the disk of the pronotum, humeral 




136 PROCEEBINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



trunk, vicinity of the anal vein and part of the anal fiekl of the 

 tegmina, indicated on the ahdon^pn only by a lineation margining 

 the pale lines dorsad; in the intensive males coloring the occiput, the 

 dorsum of the pronotum, greater portion of the tegmina and geiuT- 

 ally the dorsum of the abdomen except mesad. The tone of the tlorsal 

 color varies from claret brown to maroon, in the intensive extreme 

 blackish laterad on the abdomen. Lateral color in the male varying 

 from lettuce green to oil green, in the recessive extreme coloring the 

 middle of the occiput and the greater portion of the dorsum of the 

 abdomen with oil green, in the intensive extreme the latter is repre- 

 sented by a median section of oil yellow, occasional individuals 

 having this mars yellow and antique brown. The pale pattern 

 varies in tone from flat white to pale orange-yellow (on the abdomen 

 only), occasionally tinged with greenish, the pattern coloring the 

 usual areas and in the intensive individuals almost as wide on the 

 pronotum as on the tegmina, the ventral margin of tht^ lateral lobes 

 edged with the same in intensive specimens. Head with a medio- 

 longitudiual occipito-fastigial thread of the pale color, faintly tinged 

 with the encompassing color; broad vertical infra-ocular and infra- 

 antennal bars of the pale pattern rather strongly (intensive) or weakly 

 (recessive) contrasted; antennae of the dorsal color (intensive) or 

 orange (recessive); eyes varying from auburn to l)ay. Tegmina 

 with the ground color of the discoidal field and much of. the anal 

 field blackish brown, the overlying venation anil solid paler section 

 of the anal field of the lateral cdor (recessive) or mars yellow (inten- 

 sive). Abdomen with the dorsal section of the segments more or 

 less decidedly edged distad with the paU^ pattern; disto-dorsal 

 abdominal segment largely of the dorsal color; cerci varying from 

 greenish proximad and weak mahogany red distad to entirely orange 

 rufous. Limbs of the lateral color, not at all (recessive) or more or 

 less (intensive) washed with burnt sienna on the tibiae and the 

 distal extremities of the femora; genicular region of the cauilal femora 

 blackish in intensive individuals; jjattern of the pagina of the caudal 

 femora restricted, decided in intensive and weak in recessive indi- 

 viduals, ventro-lateral face of caiidal femora flat white in inten-iive 

 specimens; foramina of cephalic tibia' whitish with a seal i)rown 

 figure. 



The recessive females are nearly uniform old gold to liiscay green, 

 pa.s.sing into civctte green on the limbs, the head pale green yellow 

 with no markings except a faint postocular pale bar and an edging 

 of claret b^o^vn dorsad to the same; pronotum more or less parrot

green caudad, the pale lines weak; tegmina claret brown me.sad. 

 marginal field of the pale pattern ; abdomen with weak narrow paired 

 pale lines, more or less distinctly edged dorsad by a line of claret 

 ■ brown; ovipositor touched with pinkish proximad, the teeth black 

 tipped. Intensive females with the dorsal color covering most of the 

 occiput (not mcsad), the cephalic and at least part of the caudal 

 section of the disk of the pronotum, in tone varying from claret 

 brown to mahogany red. The lateral color varies, in intensive 

 individuals (stuffed specimens) from olive green to ochraceous-tawny, 

 passing into variscite green on the pleura and coxse of ochraceous- 

 tawny specimens, the lateral color covering the dorsum of the abdo- 

 men and limbs as well as the lateral and ventral aspects. Pale 

 pattern in intensive specimens broad, very broad on abdomen. Head 

 in intensive specimens with the vertical bars described in the male 

 rather weakly indicated, otherwise as in that sex. Pronotum with 

 the color of the caudal portion of the disk passing; from the dorsal 

 color into that of the lateral regions, the pale bars outlined dorsad 

 more or less distinctly with blackish; lateral lobes occasionall.y 

 washed with hoary white. Tegmina of intensive females with the 

 base color of the discoitlal field blackish. Abdomen with the lateral 

 coloration more or less sprinkled with claret brown stipplings; 

 lateral pale bars more or less washed with flesh pink to rose pink, 

 sharply outlined dorsad on each segment by semi-lunate edgings of 

 black, which form continuous series conforming in arcuation to the 

 form of the abdomen; ovipositor in intensive specimens strongly 

 garnet brown to victoria lake on proximal two-thirds of dorsal 

 margin. All limbs with the genicular region more or less strongly 

 antl sharply suffused with claret brown; all tarsi blackish. Caudal 

 limbs with the pattern as in intensive males, in one individual the 

 dorsal section of the proximal half of the femora is largely whitish. 



Both the type and allotype are intensive individuals. With a 

 single exception, all of the nymphs seen are in or approaching the 

 intensive condition, the exception being about midway between the 

 two extremes. 



' Distribution. — The present species has a very limited range, being 

 found so far as known only at certain elevations in western Texas 

 and at an unlocated point in Coahuila, Mexico. Aside from Mara- 

 thon, Texas, the species is known only in that State from the Davis 

 and Chisos Mountains, the former range beginning about forty miles 

 northwest of Marathon, the latter lying seventy-five miles due south 

 from the same point. At Marathon (where it was very infrequent 




138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



and occurred with D. brerihastata) it was taken between 3,900 and 

 4,160 feet, while in the Davis Mountains it occurred in Lower Limpia 

 Canyon at 4,900 feet, at Maguires Ranch in Upper Limpia Canyon 

 at 5,600 feet and on the slopes of Pine Mountain at 6,500 feet. In 

 the Chisos Mountains it was secured at Moss Well at 4,500-5,300 

 feet, in the canyon behind PuUiam Bluff at 4,600-5,000 feet and on 

 the slopes of Lost Mine Peak at 6,000 feet. The vertical range of 

 the species is thus seen, at least in Texas, to extend from about 3,900 

 to 6,500 feet. 



Biological Notes. — This peculiar species has been found in a number 

 ■of situations, on bare rock, in grasses and weeds, in a number of 

 sjjecies of shrubby plants and in low trees, once in a nogal or walnut 

 tree {Juglans rupestris). In such places thej' climb gingerly about, 

 at night giving occasionally a very faint lisping stridulation, of a 

 tinkling, sibilant character, which can be represented by zip-a zip-u 

 zip-a zip-ip-ip-ip, the last portion being given infrequently and then 

 very rapidly. This note can scarcely be heard at a distance greater 

 than .six feet. 



Morphological Notes. — In the male the greatest morphological 

 variation ai)pears to be that in the angulation of the distal margin 

 ■of the subgonital i)late, this being more broadly obtuse-angulate in 

 many specimens than in the type, while the bottom Of the emargina- 

 tion is nearly rounded in one individual. The male tegniina vary 

 somewhat in Imlk, this causing t\w disto-sutural margin to appear 

 nearly straight in those having tlie longest tegmina and more or less 

 arcuate (or subangulate) at the apex of the anal vein in those with 

 shorter tegmina. The caudal margin of the disk of the pronotum 

 is truncate in some and feebly emarginate in other specimens, but 

 ■weakly arcuate (as in the type) in the majority. The female tegmina 

 vary considerably in proportionate size, and the interspace between 

 the same consequently shows an equal amount of variation, ranging 

 from but little over half to that of a whole tegmen width. The oviposi- 

 tor exhibits similar variation in depth to that seen in certain other 

 species of the genus, in the majority of .specimens the distal half being 

 subequal in depth and tapering only in the proximal half, although 

 the form of the margins remains practically the same. The sjiines 

 at the distal extremity of the ovipositor vary in number from seven 

 to nine dorsad and seven to ten ventrad. 



Jiemarks. — The peculiar characters of the male of this form imme- 

 • liately separate it from all of its congeners except catinata, from which 

 it can readily be distinguished liy the lobe of the cercus not being 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 139 



sulitruncate at the apex and having the margins of the same con- 

 verging distad. The female is not so readily scjiarated, but it is 

 hardly likely to be confused with anything but catinata, the charac- 

 ters of difference from which are given in the diagnosis. This is 

 peculiarly a mountain form, the Marathon locality being very close 

 to the foot of mountains in conditions not at all desert-like. The 

 last-mentioned locality was the only place in Texas where it was found 

 associated with another species of the genus (D. brevihastata), which 

 there far outnumbered the present form. The large tegmina of the 

 male are quite characteristic, of oreaca, which in the male sex and in 

 the intensively colored female is remarkably pretty.

Color Notes. — As but the type and allotype" of cutinata have fully 

 retained their original coloration, the following notes are based en- 

 tirely on them. 



Male (Type). General pattern consisting of a dorsal color, a 

 latero-ventral color and a pale pattern, the first covering the occiput, 

 the dorsum of the pronotum, hiuneral trunk, discoidal and greater 

 portion of anal fields of the tegmina and greater portion of the dorsum 

 of the abdomen. The tone of this color is between burnt sienna and 

 ■chestnut, that of the latero-ventral color cosse green, while the pale 

 pattern runs from creamy on the head to white on the tegmina and 




142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACUJEMY OF [Jaa., 



pinard yellow on the abdomen, the latter pattern limited to a medio- 

 longitudinal occiiiital and fastigial thread, and paireil bai-s extending 

 caudad from the eyes along the lateral margins of the disk anxi 

 margining laterad the dorsal color of the abdomen. Head wth the 

 face, mouth-parts, gense, and much of the postocular region maize 

 yellow; eyes bay; antennae of the dorsal color proximad, parsing into 

 antique browm •\\'ith a few well-spaced moderately broad annuli of 

 seal brown. Pronotum nith the pale bars slightly tinged with 

 greenish, in the vicinity of the aiigle the caudal margin of the disk 

 and of the lobes is blackish. Tegmina ^\^th the marginal field wholly 

 of the pale color, the distal portion of the discoidal field with the 

 base color blackish brown and the vein pattern of the general dorsal 

 color, anal field with the vicinity. of the proximal two-thirds of the 

 anal vein broadly blackish browii, the proximal portion of the sutural 

 margin edged with same, median section of the anal field washed 

 with barita yellow. Dorsum of the abdomen with the median 

 portion of the segments having the base color weak and each segment 

 with a proximal area of pinard yellow (most decided proximad), 

 laterad the dorsal color is outlined with blackish, this latter oblique 

 and independent on each segment, the contiguous yellowish portion 

 of the pale pattern broken up in consequence. Disto-dorsal abdomi- 

 nal segment of the dorsal color, cerci mars yellow. Cephalic limbs 

 mars yellow, passnig into the latero-vcntral color proximad, the tarsi 

 clove brown. Median femora largely of the lateral color passing 

 into mars yellow, tarsi clove brown. Caudal femora of the lateral 

 color, passing distad into mars yellow ■with a decided genicular area 

 of blackish, pattern of pagina pronounced, but not extensive; caudal 

 tibiae seal hrowni dorsad, honey yellow ventrad, caudal tarsi .seal 

 brown. 



Female (Allotype). Nearly uniform light yellowish olive (probably 

 more vivid in life), passing into light bice green on the limbs, ap- 

 proaching forest green on the medio-longitudinal portion of the 

 caudal femora, the ventral carina of the same whitish. Pale lines 

 feebly indicated on the head and the cephalic portion of the pronotum; 

 caudal margin of the pronotum with blackish a-* in the male; disk 

 of the pronotum with a faint medio-longitudinal thread of aul)urn, 

 which is intersected by a black spot at the crossing of the transverse 

 sulcus; eyes auburn; antenme aniline yellow pa,-ising into pyrite 

 yellow distad with a few scattered weak annulations. Tegmina 

 weakly suffused with antique brown mesad. Abtlomen with the 

 tegmina covering a Ijlackish blotch.

Distribution. — The present species is only known from the vicinity 

 of Brownsville in the arid tropical Tamaulipan section of the lower 

 Rio Grande Valley, Texas. The range of the species unquestionably 

 extends south into Mexico. 



Biological Notes. — This form was numerous in vine-covered hedges 

 and tangles near old Fort Brown, Brownsville, where they were 

 heard stridulating at numerous points about dusk, but they were 

 extremely difficult to secure, owing to their surroundings, as they 

 always sought refuge within the tangled hedges when approached. 

 The stridulation is a faint t.'iikh, repeated at intervals of about twice 

 the length of the note. 



Morphological Notes. — From the evidence of the two males, the 

 median width of the disk of the pronotum is seen to vary somewhat, 

 in the paratype this being as much as two-thirds the caudal width 

 of the disk.

Dichopetala tauriformis n. sp. 



This is a very peculiar and distinct species having no close relation- 

 ship to any other form in the genus, in the female sex showing some 

 affinity to falcata and in the male sex approximating poUicifera more 

 nearly than anything else. The peculiar appendage of the supra-anal 

 plate of the male, the anomalous cerci, the strongly depressed median 

 section of which, together ^vith the elongate aciculate tooth which is 

 peculiarly curved, and the unusual structure of the distal section of 

 the shaft, as well as the very decided peculiarities of the subgenital 

 ' plate at once distinguish the male sex, while in the female the ovi- 

 positor is proportionately the longest and heaviest in the genus, the 

 subgenital plate with its lateral trigonal lobes also being quite 

 different from that found in falcata.

Color Notes. — This species has the usual intensive and recessive 

 extremes, the former of which has a dorsal color much darker than 

 the lateral one, in the recessive extreme there being almost no differ- 

 ence in tone between the lateral and dorsal colors. As far as present 

 material goes, the extremes are almost equally marked in the two 

 sexes and the tones are very similar in both. We here give the 

 colors as found in the material, but as none of it has been stuffed 

 there is a strong probability that the greens, at least, have lost much 

 of their intensity. Dorsal color varying from sulphine yellow 

 (extreme in the females alone) to dull maroon (intensive of both 

 sexes), traces of the latter being present in the reces.sive males,-' 

 while this color is solid and pure on the head and disk of the pronotum 

 of intensive individuals of both sexes. On the dorsum of the abdomen

-' Possibly the recessive condition in the male is wholly due to desiccation, 

 the original dorsal color being 'left in patches. We, however, do not feel con- 

 vinced that this is the case, as the general tonal correlation of what we consider 

 the recessive male is essentially the same as in the undoubtedly recessive females. 




148 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



this intensive color is only pure laterad, mesad the tone being aniline 

 yellow to sulphine yellow, thickly and closely stippled with maroon. 

 The lateral maroon bordering lines are narrowly present in even the 

 recessive males as well as faintly indicated in the recessive females. 

 Lateral color varying from sulphine yellow to buffy citrine, the males 

 being almost all sulphine yellow, particularly pure in the intensive 

 males. Pale lateral lines very narrow, more or less indicated in all, 

 varying from creamy white to maize yellow, rarely touched with 

 orange pink, extending "from the caudal margin of the eye to the base 

 of the cercus. Eyes varying from chamois (recessive male) and buffy 

 citrine (recessive female) to old gold (intensive male) and cinnamon 

 brown (intensive female). Antennae varying much the same as the 

 dorsal color. Tegmina of male largely oil green, the proximal 

 portion of the humeral trunk blackish, large jiortion of anal field 

 washed with warm sepia, marginal fiekl shell pink; temina of female 

 with discoidal field oil green, anal field vsimilar, occasionally (intensive 

 female [allotype]) washetl with inaroon, marginal field shell ]Mnk to 

 ochre red. Ovipositor varying with the dorsal color. Limbs varying 

 from pois green to grape green, occasionally washed with purplish 

 vinaceous on median and cephalic pair in recessive specimens, of the 

 same greatly suffused, lined and spotted with maroon in intensive 

 individuals. The latter condition is very decided in its extreme, the 

 femora having nearly solid pr(>genicular patches dorsad, while the 

 distal extremities of the tibiie and all of the tarsi are suffused with 

 maroon. The type and allotype are in the extreme intensive con- 

 dition, which is shared or approximated by several other specimens. 



Distribution. — The present species is known only from three locali- 

 ties in the state of San Luis Potosi in the east-central portion of the 

 Mexican tableland: Sierra de San Miguelito, mountains twelve 

 leagues east of San Luis Potosi city, and mountains at .\lvarez. The 

 first-mentioned locality we are unable to locate, so its altitude cannot 

 be given, but it probably ha.s much the same elevation as the other 

 localities, which range between five and sbc thousand feet. Alvarez 

 is on the ui)])er course of tiie Ilio \'erde, a head triinitary of the 

 Rio Panuco, east of the city of San Luis Potosi. 



Morphohvjicnl Xotc.i. — The tegmina of the male show variation in 

 the angulation of the sutural margin and in the character of the 

 distal margin. The latter is more arcuate in one specimen than in 

 the type and in one iiarat>iiic male it is more truncate. The curve 

 of the striduluting vein also varies somewhat. TIk- stalked process 

 on the male subgenital plate in onv jiaratype is similar to that of 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 1-19 



the type, while in the others the head of the process is more 

 or less expanded ^\^th the distal margin arcuate. The anomalous 

 cerci seem to vary little or not at all, while the subgenital plate varies 

 only in that the quadrate emargination of the distal margin is re- 

 placed by a ^-shaped emargination in one paratype. The female 

 shows variation chiefly in the robustness of the ovipositor, although 

 this is not as pronounced as in some other species of the genus. 



Remarks.— The structure of the apex of the alxlomen in the male 

 of this species and the very heavy ovipositor of the female are char- 

 acters which serve to easily distinguish the present peculiar form. 

 There is no approach to the genital structure of the male in any of 

 the other forms of the genus, except that the tooth springs from the 

 external margin of the shaft of the cercus in this and in pollidfera, 

 which similarity is somewhat augmented by the general form of the 

 pronotum and tegmina, but there the analogy ceases, as the details of 

 the abdominal appendages and of the tegmina are quite different. 

 The female sex, however, shows no close affinity to pollidfera, while it 

 does have much in common with falcata, to which the male sex shows 

 no affinity.

Dichopetala tridactyla n. sp. 



This species can be immediately separated in the male sex from all 

 of the species of the genus, except D. aiudelli, by the peculiar appen- 

 diculate character of the cercus, while from caudelli it can be separated 

 in the male sex by the shorter tegmina, the very brief distal portion 

 of the anal field of the same, by the sutural margin of the tegmina 

 being strongly produced at the apex of the stridulating vein and by 

 the more elongate median tooth of the cercus. In the female sex 

 tridactyla can be separated from caudelli by the shorter ovipositor 

 and blunter apices to the lobes of the subgenital plate.

From these measurements it is evident that the type is distinctly 

 under the average in size, while the allotype is considerably over the 

 average for the female sex, both sho\ving in certain proportions the 

 minimum and maximum proportions, respectively, for their sexes. 

 The selection of the type and allotype was based solely on the con- 

 dition of the specimens, so no size factors were considered in the 

 matter. It is apparent from the above evidence that there is con- 

 siderable individual variation in size in the species. 



Color Notes. — As none of the material belonging to this species 

 has been stuffed, we are compelled to take the colors found at their 

 face value, although doubtless some have altered very materially. 

 The pattern of both sexes consists of a more or less uniform dorsal 

 color involving a variable portion of the occiput, dorsum of the 

 pronotum, dorsal portion of the lateral lobes of the pronotum and 

 dorsum of the abdomen, and a pale lateral color which involves the 

 face, gense, ventral portion of the lateral lobes, and lateral aspect of 

 the abdomen, the latter color always ( cf ) or frequently ( 9 ) modi- 

 fied in extent and tint. 



Male. Dorsal color varying from prout's brown .to clove browoi, 

 most decided near its lateral borders on the abdomen. Lateral color 

 varying from buckthorn brown to di'esden brown, the ventral half 




lo-l PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



■of the lateral lobes of the abdomen and the marguial field of the 

 tegmina creamy white in intensive specimens; paired lateral lines 

 on the abdomen (in the usual position of pale lines in the genus) 

 contrasted wnth a wash of the dorsal color on the proximo-ventral 

 portion of the abdomen. Head with narrow postocular lines and a 

 medio-longitudinal thread on the occiput and fastigiura creamy 

 ■white, in intensive individuals the dorsal color covering much of the 

 postocular portion of the genae; eyes varying from dresden bro^\ai to 

 cinnamon brown: antennte ferruginous dorsad, ventral surface 

 mahogany red to chestnut. Pronotum with th(> caudal .section of 

 the disk washed with auburn, continuations of the postocular lines, 

 converging to the transverse sulcus and diverging caudad of the same, 

 subobsolete near the caudal margin, varying from creamy white 

 to buff yellow; dorsal color more or less strongly clouding an obliquely 

 delimited dorsal section of the lateral lobes, ventral section of same 

 ■creamy white. Tegmina with the discoidul and anal fields with a 

 blackish-brown base, over which the veins are outlined in ochraceous 

 orange, the greater portion of the.sutural margin washed with hay's 

 russet. Di.stal half of the appendiculate lol)(> of the ccrci infuscatc 

 with the dorsal color in intensive indiviiluals. Linib.s varying from 

 old gold to olive lake, more or less generally infuscate with chestnut 

 brown, most decided ventrad and there linear in pattern; caudal 

 femora with a pair of fine blackish lines on the ventral portion of the 

 lateral face] tibiae more or less lime green. 



Female. Dorsal color ranging from argus brown to dark mununy 

 brown; lateral color ranging from creamy white to dresden brown, 

 the latter in recessive individuals and there very poorly separated 

 from the dorsal shade. Head with pale lines less tlistinctiy indicated, 

 than in the male se.\, the extreme intensive individual having the 

 greater portion of the head opaline green. Irtthe average individuals 

 the abdomen has no decidedly indicated lateral bars dorsad margining 

 the dorsal color, but in the intensive specimens the.se bars are decided 

 creamy white, of variable width and the lateral base of the abdomen 

 is fontra.stingly washed with the dorsal color. Pronotum a.s in the 

 male, but nearly uniform in recessive individuals. Tegmina varying 

 from nearly uniform with the lateral color to blackish browii, with the 

 venation of the lateral color, in the intensive extreme having the 

 costal portion of the latter color. Ovipositor varying from citrine 

 to nrange-citrine, distal ])ortion infuscate in .some specimens. Limbs 

 varying from viridine green (in this the femora pale bluish white 

 proximad) to cosse green, marked much as in the male, but with the

infuscatioii more or less tessellate or marmorate, linear and punctate 

 in character. 



Distribution. — The present species is only known from two localities 

 in the central portion of the Mexican tableland — Camacho, Zacatecas, 

 and Jimulco, Coahuila. Its vertical distribution is apparently from 

 somewhat below five thousand to about six thousand feet. 



Morphological Notes. — In the male sex the only morphological 

 variation worth noting is that of the degree of arcuation of the 

 margins of the distal excision of the subgenital plate. In the type 

 these margins are straighter than in the others of the sex, but in all 

 they are more or less arcuate toward the angles. In the female sex 

 the ovipositor varies appreciably in robustness without correlation 

 with the general size. 



Remarks. — The present species and D. caudelli constitute a very 

 distinct section of the genus, having no close relationship to any of 

 the other forms. 



Specimens Examined. — 21; 5 males, 16 females.

This species is close to D. tridactyla, but can be readily separated 

 in the male sex by the distinctly longer tegmina, the more normal 

 distal portion of the anal field of the same, the sutural margin of which 

 is but little produced at the apex of the stridulating vein and by 

 the shorter median tooth of the cercus, while in the female the 

 slightly longer ovipositor and acute apices to the lobes of the sub- 

 genital plate enable one to distinguish the present form. The 

 species is similar to tridactyla in the majority of the characters, so 

 we have made our description in large part comparativef When not 

 mentioned specifically, the structure is understood to be similar to 

 that in tridactyla.

Color Notes. — In recessive individuals this species is unicolorous, 

 while in intensive individuals the dorsal color is distinctly darker 

 than the lateral, and pale paired bars arc more or less decidedly indi- 

 cated in all l)ut the extreme recessive specimens. The extreme 

 recessive condition is represented by one female, closely approached 

 by another of the same sex and less closely by a male. The extreme 

 intensive condition is rei)re.';ented by one male and one female and 

 approached by three other females. The tjTie is nearly intermediate 

 between the extremes, but slightly nearer the intensive condition: 

 the allotype approaches the intensive condition, but is not typical 

 of it. The extreme recessive condition ( 9 ) is uniform light brownish 

 olive except for the tegmina. The extreme intensive condition in 

 the male has the dorsal color maroon along the lateral margins of the 

 area on the head, disk of pronotum, and abdomen, paling to cedar 

 green and weak bufi' yellow (on abdoriien only) mesad, while in the 

 female the general tone of the dorsum is tawny, washed with claret 

 brown caudad on each abdominal segment and margined laterad 

 by the same. The suffusing color of the dorsum is largely produc«d 

 by stippling and the extreme margins of the pronotum and abdominal 

 segments are of the color of the pale lateral lines beaded with the 

 suffusing tone. The dorsal color of the male ranges through old 

 gold with wi'akly indicated blackish lateral margins, of the female 

 through kildare green finely sprinkled with maroon. Pale lateral 

 lines varying from chalk white to weak orange pink (in part only and 

 in the intensive male), narrow in the female and broad in the male, 

 cover the entire marginal field of the tegmina in both .sexes. 

 In the male these lines are crenulate on the abdomen, while in the 

 female they are more or less obliquely off.set on each segment . Lateral 

 color of male varying from yellowish olive green (intensive extreme) 

 to chamois (recessive extreme), in the female from the reces.sive 

 extreme with it uniform with the dorsum to the intensive extreme 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 159 



which has it sayal bro^vn, the segments of the abdomen stippled and 

 beaded as on the dorsum, the lateral lobes of the pronotum touched 

 with mignonette green in this type. Head with the eyes varying 

 from cinnamon buff to snuff brown. Pronotum with the lateral 

 lobes edged with the color of the pale bars in all but the recessive 

 females, in one of the intensive females there being a considerable 

 area of chalky white on the ventral portion of the lobes. Tegmina 

 of male with the humeral trunk claret brown to bay, discoidal field 

 varying from yellowish olive green to cosse green, anal field sharing 

 the same tone, but more or less oil green mesad with the proximal 

 portion more or less mahogany red. Tegmina of the female divided 

 between the dorsal and lateral color with the region of the humeral 

 trunk claret brown to bay. Limbs almost wholly of the lateral color, 

 occasionally more greenish in tone, in intensive individuals more or 

 less washed, lined and stippled (particularly on cephalic and median 

 pair) with claret brown. Dorsal aspect of the cerci of male washed 

 with claret brown. Ovipositor with teeth blackish. 



Distribution. — This species, as far as known, has a limited range in 

 the east-central portion of the Mexican tableland, occurring at three 

 localities in the state of San Luis Potosi: San Luis Potosi City and 

 hills near the same, mountains twelve leagues east of San Luis Potosi 

 and mountains at Alvarez. The latter locality is south of the upper 

 ■ course of the Rio Verde, a tributary of the Rio Panuco which empties 

 into the Gulf of Mexico near Tampico. As far as we are able to 

 determine from several topographic maps, the localities are situated 

 between five thousand and six thousand two hundred feet elevation. 

 • Morphological Notes. — In the female sex there is some little varia- 

 tion in the shape of the caudal ^margin of the disk of the pronotum, 

 this ranging from gently arcuate to sinuato-truncate. The inter- 

 space between the tegmina also varies considerably in width in the 

 same sex, in the greatest extreme lieing subequal in width to a single 

 tegmen. The ovipositor varies slightly but appreciably in depth 

 and in the number of teeth on the dorsal margin (6 to 8). 



Renuirks. — We take pleasure in dedicating this species to Mr. 

 A. N. Caudell, of the United States National Museum, who called 

 our attention to the peculiar cerci of the male sex.

12. Similar Environmental Conditions versus Mimicry as an Interpreta-

Certain criticisms of the theories of mimicry and warning colors 

 have recently appeared in the publications of The Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and it is, I think, a convenience 

 that the controversy should be continued in the same channel. 

 The occasion also enables me to contribute in, I hope, an appropriate 

 way to the publications of the great and learned society with which I 

 have the honor and pleasure of being specially associated. 



In the present paper I propose to deal with the friendly criticisms 

 contained in Dr. Henry Skinner's paper (33). It will be most 

 convenient, I think, to consider the author's arguments under 

 separate heads, which I have arranged as far as possible in the same 

 order as that adopted in his memoir. 



1. The Attacks of Birds on Butterflies and the Theories of 



Mimicry. 



The believers in these theories, both Batesian and Miillerian, will 

 cordially agree with Dr. Skinner as to the paramount importance 

 11 




162 . PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



of showing "that birds are in the habit of eating butterflies and that 

 some butterflies are poisonous or nauseous to them and others not." 

 (33, p. 121.) It must be admitted also that we require vastly more 

 evidence than we at present possess. But evidence is accumulating 

 steadily, and some of the best has been forthcoming in recent years. 

 I may refer especially to Mr. S. A. Neave's observation (30) on 

 January 12, 1912, of a Wagtail devouring Lycaniid and Pierine 

 butterflies, but rejecting an Acraea, in the bed of a forest stream near 

 Entebbe, Uganda. 



Dr. Skinner, in a more recent paper (34, p. 25) refers to the fact that 

 the Biological Survey of the United States examined fifty thousand 

 bird stomachs and only found butterflies in five of them. Mr. 

 C. F. M. Swynnerton has quite lately thrown nuich light on this 

 method of investigation (33). He is convinced, as the result of 

 recent work at Chirinda, Gazaland, southeast Rhodesia, "that 

 conclusions based on stomach-examination are likely to be fallacious, 

 unless that examination has been so thorough and minute that even 

 such small objects as the scales of Lepidoptera must have been 

 detected if present, even in small numbers, in either stomach or 

 intestines, unless a very large series has been so examined for each 

 species, and unless, finally, a note had been made at the time of the 

 shooting of each specimen as to the probable proportions in which 

 insects of various kinds were present at the moment." Mr. Swyn- 

 nerton's paper was especially intended as a reply to Mr. G. L. Bates 

 (25), whose statements are quoted l)y Dr. Skinner (33, p. 122). 

 I have treated this subject very briefly and inadequately because 

 I hope to return to it in a later paper dealing with the attacks made 

 by Mr. W. L. McAfee in a memoir (38) written in a very different 

 spirit from that of Dr. Skinner. 



2. Haase's Name "PnARMACOpnA(iis" and his Hypothesis that 



Mimicked Butterflies (Models) dp;uivk Nauseous 



Qualities from the Larval Food-plants. 



Dr. Skinner, influenced by my use of Haase's term " Pharmaco- 

 phagiis," is apparently under the impression that I am a convinced 

 follower of hi-; hyi)otiiesis. This is by no means the case. In a 

 review (14) of Haase's work (13) I expressed the opinion, to which 

 I still adhere, that the hypothesis is probably true — although as yet 

 ()uite unproved — for .some distasteful siiecics, Ijut that it is certainly 

 not true of others. Rothschild and Jordan (30, 433^), following 

 Horsfield (l) and Haaso (9), have shf)wn that the Papilionina are 




1914. 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 163 



divisible into three well-marked .sections differing in larval, pupal 

 and imaginal characters. They give descriptive titles to each of the 

 sections, but do not suggest names which can be used at any rate 

 provisionally as genera. In the meantime, it is highly inconvenient 

 to include in the genus Papilio the species of all three group.s. For 

 this reason, and for this reason alone, I provisionally adopted Haase's 

 Pharmacophagus for the " Ari.stolochia swallowtails," his Papilio 

 for the "Fluted swallowtails," and his Cosmodesmus for the "Kite 

 swallowtails." 



I am quite ready to al^andon any or all of these when it is proved 

 that the three groups may be referred to by other names with a 

 prior claim, and, under any circumstances, Haase's terms cannot, 

 with their present meaning, permanently stand for genera, because, 

 as I learn from Dr. Jordan, each of the three sections is a much 

 larger group which must itself be split up into genera. Furthermore, 

 I do not, as Dr. Skinner states on p. 124, accept any conclusions or 

 use any argument based on the meaning of the word when I pro- 

 visionally employ "Pharmacophagus" as the name of a genus of the 

 Papilios, and I do not think that any words of mine can be quoted 

 which will bear out Dr. Skinner's interpretation. 



Inasmuch as Haase's hji^othesis occupies so large a place in 

 Dr. Skinner's memoir, I venture to offer a few remarks upon the idea 

 itself as well as upon some of the author's criticisms. 



The great majority of the pigments possessed by plant-eating 

 insects are built up in the laboratory of the living organism, in spite 

 of the fact that the larval food is rich in chlorophyll. Nevertheless, 

 this color exists ready-made, and certain insects have been specially 

 adapted to avail themselves of it and thus to gain certain pigiiients. 

 I proved this many years ago by spectroscopic examination as well 

 as in other ways (3, 4), including experiments in which larva were fed 

 upon parts of leaves devoid of chlorophyll (lO) — experiments recently 

 repeated with confirmatory results upon different species by Prof. 

 W. Garstang (24). I think it probable that nauseous or poisonous 

 substances, when they exist in a plant or in a group of allied plants, 

 may be employed by certain species which are restricted to it or 

 them; but as yet the proof is wanting. Among the most probable 

 instances, and those which should first be tested by chemical means, 

 are the Danaince feeding on the Asclepiads and the "Pharmacophagus'" 

 swallowtails feeding on Aristolochia and its allies. I may here 

 remark that Dr. Skinner is mistaken in supposing that Haase in his 

 hypothesis drew any distinction between the Danaince and the 




164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



section of the Papilios to which he gave the name Phannacophagus. 

 He maintained that both of them, and the Ithomiince audAcraince as 

 well, derived their distasteful qualities direct from the larval food- 

 plants. I refer to the following passage in which Dr. Skinner is 

 speaking of Danaida plexippus (32, p. 126): 



"The protective idea in this case is the same as in the so-called 

 pharmacophagus butterfly, the imago of plexippus which is said to 

 be repugnant to birds but the repugance is not Ijased on the idea of 

 the butterfly feeding on a poisonous plant {Asclepias) in the larval 

 stage." 



As regards the specially protected and much-mimicked group of 

 the Acrwinw, the recent hitherto impublished researches of my 

 friend IMr. W. A. Lamborn upon their larva; in the Lagos district 

 strongly suggest that the butterflies do not derive the nauseous 

 cjualities, which they undouljtedly possess, in the manner assumed by 

 Haase: for the fooil-plants belong to varied groups. In a letter 

 written July 16, 1913, and received as I am preparing this paper, 

 Mr. Lamborn states: "By far the most common Acrmi here [the 

 neighborhood of Ibadan, S. Nigeria, W. Africa] is terpsichore. Its 

 larv£E abound, and seem, like so many other distasteful caterpillars, 

 to have a wide range of food-]ilants." 



The facts lirougiit forward by Dr. Skinner do not ajjpear to me to 

 affect the ])robability of Haase's hypothesis. It is well knowTi that 

 insects feeding on a great variety of plants commonly include among 

 these species with poisonous qualities. Haase's hypothesis only 

 refers to certain insects confined to poisonous or acrid food-plants. 

 I say "certain" insects, for the power of utilizing the poisonous 

 quality, if it exist at all, is undoubtedly a special adaptation by no 

 means necessarily jiresent in any larva which feeds on the plant 

 ])ossessing the cjuality. The other fact alluded to by the author, 

 that the acrid principle may be present in very small quantity, is, 

 I think, equally devoid of bearing on the hj-^pothesis. If the adapta- 

 tion exist at all. we should expect small ([uantities to be stored up and 

 concentrated. The percentage of lime in a leaf is very small, yet the 

 larva of Clisiocampn neustria reserves enough to render its cocoon 

 ojiaciue with minute crystals of the carbonate in the form of aragonite 

 (5) and Eriogasler laneslris enough to make its eggshell-like cocoon 

 out of the oxalate (8). • 



Haase's hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved by discussion. 

 It is the work of the chemist that is needed. The most appropriate 

 field in the world for this work is North America with its hundreds 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 165 



of skilled chemists and its well-equipped laboratories, and with two 

 abundant species — Danaida (Anosia) plexippus feetling on Asclepiads 

 and Pharmacophagus (Papilio) philenor feeding on Aristolochias — 

 by which to test the validity of Haase's hypothesis. 



3. Indirect Evidence that Pharmacophagus philenor is a 

 Model possessing Distasteful Qualities. 



I have myself only seen this insect alive on one or two occasions, 

 and have certainly never had the opportunity of observing it in 

 relation to its natural enemies, nor do I know of any such observa- 

 tions. Scudder states (6, 1248-9) that the larva? are gregarious 

 when young and semigregarious in later life, that the perfect insect 

 is very tenacious of life, and he quotes Edwards for the observation 

 that it has a strong and disagreeable scent. These qualities, espe- 

 cially the two latter, are generally characteristic of distasteful species; 

 but Skinner states (32, p. 124) that later specially directed observa- 

 tions have failed to confirm Edwards. Skinner also records (p. 125) 

 the fact that the larvge are attacked by parasites, but this is commonly 

 true of Danaince, Acrccince, and other distasteful much-mimicked 

 groups. Haase is, so far as I am aware, the only writer on the 

 subject who has supposed that the immunity of models is complete, 

 and probably in all cases protection from insectivorous vertebrates 

 is to a large extent balanced by exceptional exposure to the attacks 

 of parasites and certain other insect enemies, such as Asilid flies and 

 Hemiptera (19). 



I quite agree with Skinner (p. 125) that the principal attacks are 

 made during the earlier stages of an insect's life — and think of the 

 elaborate protective adaptations which are common in these stages — 

 yet I do not doubt that the imago is subject to severe persecution 

 from enemies of many kinds. Furthermore, it must be remembered 

 that each imago, the heir of all the other stages, and especially each 

 female, is of far greater value to the species than a single pupa or 

 larva and often hundreds of times as valuable as an ovum. 



Although I must admit that there is no direct evidence to prove 

 that P. philenor is nauseous to birds (p. 123), I believe that much 

 might be learned if American naturalists would offer large numbers 

 of this swallowtail to many species of insectivorous birds in confine- 

 ment, offering at the same time other Initterflies with a prociyptic 

 under-sUrface, such as Vanessa milberti or species of Grapta {Engonia). 

 The North American Danaine models might be tested at the same 

 time. Although the records of fiekl observations are greatly to be 




16G PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



preferred to this method of experiment, yet in the absence of such 

 oliservation much may be learned by comparing the behavior of the 

 same individual bird with different species of insects. 



The indirect evidence that Ph. philenor acts as a model and pos- 

 sesses the qualities of a model seems to me extremely strong. On 

 this hypothesis many facts receive their interpretation; without it 

 they .are unexplained and meaningless. Philenor is one of the 

 '■ Aristolochia swallo\\1;ails," a section which is abundantly repre- 

 sented in tropical America and in the Oriental Region, but, with the 

 exception of Ph. antenor in Madagascar, absent from the Ethiopian 

 Region. The mimi'cry we observe in North America is not only 

 rejieated in both Regions where these swallowtails are abundant, 

 but repeated in a more convincing manner, because the patterns 

 are often far more elaborate, and because an "Aristolochia swallow- 

 tail" may break up into numerous geographical races with distinctly 

 different patterns which are mimicked in each locality by corresi)onil- 

 ing races of the " Fluted swallowtails " and, in the Neotropical Region, 

 of the '"Kite swallowtails." A good example is the Oriental Ph. 

 aristolochicB with its subspecies mimicked by the females of Pap. 

 polyles. Furthermore, there is in this case experimental evidence 

 that aristolochuv is distasteful, and its slower, more flaunting flight 

 has often been remarked upon. In the Oriental Region species of> 

 Pharmacophagus arc also sometimes mimicked by tlay-fljang moths, 

 and. in the Neotropical Region, not only by these, but by "Kite 

 swallowtails" {Cosmodemnus) and Pierlncs. Throughout the whole 

 range, as in North America, the niiinirking "Fluted swallowtails" 

 are as a rule fenuiles, while on the other hand the " Kite swallowtails" 

 are mimetic in both sexes (33). Ju-;t a-< the other much-mimicked 

 groups^ — the Danainw, Ithomiince, Heliconinw, and Acrceiiice — are 

 themselves sjiecially subject to mimicry — the genera or sections of 

 the same subfamily superficially reseml)ling each other and also 

 resembling those of the other subfamilies — so is it in both respects 

 with the South American ".\ristolochia swallowtails." In every 

 way these butterHies behave like the great dista.steful groups sujijily- 

 ing the best known models for mimicry. If we hat! no experimental 

 or other evidence that the Dunnintr are uni^alatable, the indirect 

 evidence is strong enough to warrant at any rate a provisional accejit- 

 ance of the hypothesis that the>' possess some peculiar means of 

 defence which renders them six'ciaily advantageous a-s motleh;. For 

 wherever they are indigenous in the Old World they are mimicked 

 by butterflies of other groups, and even in North America, where 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 167 



there are only three forms, each one of them is mimicked. It is not 

 as if the models for mimicry were distributed indiscriminately 

 among the butterflies. They are furnished by a few genera here and 

 there among the NymphalincB, Pierince, etc., but the vast majority 

 of them are concentrated in the four subfamilies mentioned above 

 and in the "Aristolochia swallowtails." Until these remarkable 

 and very numerous facts are explained by some other hypothesis 

 or until something stronger than negative evidence is forthcoming, 

 we are justified in accepting the hypothesis of advantageous resem- 

 blance to a specially defended model. I should be the last to rest 

 content with indirect evidence, however strong, and for many years 

 I have urged naturalists, and especially those in the tropics, tS make 

 observations and to undertake experiments. As a result of much 

 work, a considerable body of direct evidence, which cannot be ignored 

 by any fair-minded opponent, has been steadily accumulating, 

 especially from Africa; liut I freely admit that more is greatly needed., 

 and I shall continue to urge my friends to seek for it. 



4. The Attempt to explain Mimetic Resemblance as due to 

 Affinity between Model and Mimic. 



Dr. Skinner appears to adopt the above interpretation of the 

 likeness between the Papilios and Phannaco-phagus when he says 

 " The three species, glaucus, astenus, and troilus, do bear a resemblance 

 to philenor but this happens in any aggregation of species in a genus. " 

 (32, p. 125.) This interpretation does not bear inspection. In the 

 first place, the butterflies do not in any real sense belong to the same 

 genus, and it is for this very reason that I have provisionally adopted 

 Haase's Pharmacophagus for philenor. In the second place, the three 

 mimetic species are placed by Rothschild and Jordan in three different 

 groups of the section " Papilio" ("Fluted swallowtails"). In the 

 third place, it is clear that the true affinity is shown by the non- 

 mimetic patterns rather than by the mimetic ones— by the upper 

 surface of the male asterius and by the males and glaucus females of 

 glaucus. 



Darwin suggested that mimicry began "long ago between forms 

 not widely dissimilar in color, " and Scudder adopts the same hypothe- 

 sis in the following passage : 



"The process has been a long one, so that . . . . , we may readily 



presume far less difference between mocker and mocked when the 



■^limicry between them first began, than now exists between the 



mocked and the normal relatives of the mocker. " (6, p. 715). It is 




168 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jail., 



obvious that this interpretation of the resemblances borne by other 

 insects to the stinging Hymenoptcra cannot be thus explained, 

 and, within the Lepidoptera themselves, the study of detail has 

 often furnished a refutation. Thus Prof. Gowlaiul Hopkins (Vi, 

 p. 680) writes: "The mimicking Pierid retains the characteristic 

 pigments of its grouj), while those of the mimicked Helicouid are 

 quite distinct. This would seem wholly to refute the argument 

 that in such cases the likeness may spring from a real affinity between 

 the two insects." (See p. 176.) 



5. Sexual Dimorphism (Antigeny of Scudder) and Mimk ry. 



The mimetic butterflies of North America, as in other parts of the 

 world, are in large part mimetic in the female sex only, forming a 

 special subsection of the far wider group of sexually dimorphic or 

 antigenetic species. Dr. Skinner seeks to explain the special sub- 

 section and the inclusive group by an appeal to the same general 

 law. Thus, speaking of the mimetic females of North American 

 Papilios, he says on p. 125: "These differences [between the sexes] 

 occur in numerous species and it seems logical to consider that they 

 are governed by a general law rather than that a few of them are 

 caused by jirotective resemblance." He uses the same argument 

 concerning the female Anjynnis diana, which Scudder maintains in 

 the most positive terms to l)e a mimic of Lrnwuitls (B) astijaiiiix. 

 (6, I, pp. 266, 287, 718; III. p. 1802). Comparing this Argynnid with 

 five other sexually dimorjihic sjiecies of the genus in Nortli America, 

 Skinner says on p. 126: "It does not seem consistent to pick out one 

 species (diana) and say that its antigeny is due to tertiary mimicry. 

 How can the dimorphism of the other species be explained?" Rut 

 the female diana is, according to two eminent North American 

 entomologists, Scudder and Edwards, picked out by nature and 

 distinguished among the other antigenetic females by the fact that 

 it resembles a sjjecies of a very different Nymjjhaline genus. I agree 

 with them — although my opinion is worth very little as compared 

 with theirs, for I have never seen the species alive and I was seeking 

 to place a resemblance which jjuzzled Scudder, in its true position 

 among the mimetic butterflies of the Region. The far wider ques- 

 tion of sexual dimorphism in general did not fall within tiie scope of 

 my paper. Again, referring to the mimetic female Fapilio, I do not 

 know why it is specially logical to seek to explain by the same general 

 law two very different categories, viz., the .sexuailj- dimorphic 

 females that closely resemble other species and. those that bear no 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 169^ 



guch resemblance. I doubt whether Dr. Skinner would venture to. 

 apply the same argument to the polymorphic mimetic females of 

 the Ethiopian Papilio dardanus or to many other examples that 

 could be cited. The North American females are not nearly so 

 striking as these, but their patterns are explained by .the theories of 

 mimicry and by no other theories as yet suggested. 



There are doubtless certain general principles which underlie the 

 whole phenomenon of sexual dimorphism. One of these is obvious — 

 the linking of color, pattern ami structure (as we see in the shape 

 of the wings or in the forefeet of so many butterflies) with sex — 

 a linking which is so apt to occur in insects as well as in several other 

 groups, and is so specially conspicuous in the Lepidoptera Rhopalo- 

 cera. To this principle I think another may be -added, at any rate 

 so far as the butterflies are concerned— the greater variability of 

 .sex-limited patterns in the female (23). But these general principles 

 do not explain the different categories of antigenetic females, although 

 they may, and I think do, explain the fact that there is material out 

 of which these categories have l)een liuilt by selection. They would 

 also, of cour.se, account for any antigenetic characters, if such there 

 be, that have not been subject to selection. They are the nearest 

 approach to a general law governing antigeny as a whole that can be 

 ofTered in the present state of our knowledge. 



Beyond these principles we have, I submit, to look for special 

 explanations rather than for general laws. 



(1) The mimetic females are probably to be explained, as Wallace 

 suggested (2, p. 22), by the special needs and special habits of the- 

 sex, but also by the fact that the difference in pattern varial/ility 

 may be such that the evolution of mimicry is initiated in one sex 

 and prevented in the other (23, p. 132). 



(2) A second class of female patterns is procryptic, meeting the 

 special needs of the sex by promoting concealment. 



(3) In a third class the whole or a certain proportion of the females 

 of a species retains ancestral patterns (or structures like the fore 

 feet mentioned above) which have been lost or become more degener- 

 ate in the males. 



(4) Finally the fact that males are so often distinguished from their 

 females by brilliant tints which are pigmentary in some species and 

 structural in others and by scent-producing organs of many kinds 

 strongly suggests anjimportant fourth class due to the operation of 

 sexual selection. 



The summary briefly set forth in the last paragraphs will, I think. 




170 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



show the hopelessness of any attempt to Ijrhig all the examples of 

 sexual dimorphism under any single law except one which expresses 

 the two principles explained on p. 169. The complexity of the 

 suhject is still further increased by the fact that different elements 

 in the pattern of a species will often fall into more than one class. 

 Thus Dixey has maintained that the female of Argynnis diana 

 Ijelongs to the thirtl of the above classes except as regards "the 

 large expanse of blue ground colour." which is mimetic and belongs 

 to the first class (7, p. 106, footnote). 



In his later paper (34) Dr. Skinner has still further developed 

 his objections to any special interpretation of the various classes 

 of sexual dimorphism in butterflies. He speaks of velvety patches 

 on the fore wings of male Satyrincv and brands on the wings of male 

 Hesperidm. The researches of Fritz Miiller (29) show that these 

 -structures are scent-producing organs, and there is no doubt that 

 they are of use in courtshij), or epigamic. The law that would l)e so 

 •comprehensive as to explain at once an epigamic scent-patch, the 

 more rudimentary anterior foot of a male Nymjjhalid and the mimetic 

 pattern of its female, woukl be so very general that it would not 

 -carry us any distance in the attempt to untlerstand each of these 

 different facts. 



Concerning PnpiUo glduriis (jlaucus and its dark titrims female 

 (I adopt Rothschild and Jordan's synonymy, 30, p. 582), which some 

 naturalists at least regard as mimetic of Ph. philenor, Skinner sa^'s 

 (34, p. 25) in criticism of Edwards: "Ther(> is also an assumption 

 "to which I take exception. Does anyone know which onc»[the dark 

 or the male-like female] appeared first and why?" With regard 

 to the last word "why," Edwards had expressly disclaimed know- 

 ledge, for he speaks of "some unknown influence" causing the appear- 

 ;ancc of the black female, and we can say no more than this to-day. 

 With regard to the other part of the question, I think it may be 

 shown that Edwards took the reasonable view in suppt)sing that the 

 dark female appeared later than the male-like one. The male 

 liattern is shown to l)e ancestral, i, "cause it bears an intimate relation- 

 shi)) to the pattern of other allied Papilios. 



This is the argmnent used by Scudder (6, p. 534) in the following 

 ijjassage: "In Jaxoniadcs (jlaiirus, where we .sometimes have a 

 .black female, it is more difficult to decide what shouUl i)e considered 

 the normal color, owing to diversit>' of \iew upon the relationship 

 of many of the swallowtails; but, to judge only from those agreed 

 by all to be most nearly allied to it, there can be no question whatever 

 .that the striped character prevails." 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 171 



The turnus female is a partially melanic variety, but the lines of 

 the male pattern can be detected beneath the overspreading pigment. 

 It also exhibits many features in its pattern which have received no 

 interpretation except that they are mimetic of philenor or secondarily 

 mimetic of the other Papilionine mimics of philenor (21, 467-471). 

 No doubt there are examples in which it is probal)le that melanic 

 females preserve something of an ancestral pattern, as in Argynnis 

 <liana or the valeftin.a form of our British .4. paphia (7, 103-5, 119-21), 

 liut I do not think that anyone has maintained that this is true of 

 the melanic females of Papilios. It is, I submit, unreasonable to 

 suppose that the male-like pattern first appeared almost hidden 

 ■under the melanism of the turnuti female, and that the full jjattern 

 became evident by the clearing up of the dark pigment; whereas 

 the opposite view, that the partial melanism appeared later, obscuring 

 l)ut not completely hiding a pre-existing male-like pattern, seems to 

 me entirely probable. Such partial melanism, in my opinion, 

 provided the foundation on which the details of tlie mimetic resem- 

 blance were gradually built. 



As regard this same species. Dr. Skinner's final conclusions (34, 

 p. 26) are comprised in the following statement: "The evidence in 

 favor of glaucus being brought about by mimicry is almost nil, while 

 the evidence against it is very considerable. The species swarms 

 in countless thousands in the north where glaucus does not exist." 

 When we add to these last words the fact that the model P. philenor 

 is also non-existent in the north. Dr. Skinner's argument seems to 

 .support the view he is attacking. P. philenor only enters New 

 England and Southern Canada as a straggler and barely overlaps 

 the range of the northern subspecies of P. glaucus glaucus, which 

 Rothschild and Jordan distinguish under the name of P. glaucus 

 ■canadensis (30, p. 586). As regards the closely allied P. rutulus, the 

 same great authorities give reasons for considering it a distinct 

 sjiecies. The whole range of glaucus glaucus — Florida to New 

 England and westward to the ■ Mississippi basin — lies within that 

 of P. philenor, and over this whole range the dark turnus female 

 occurs intermingled with male-like females — the latter preponderating 

 in the north, the former in the south. The evidence based on geo- 

 graphical distribution seems to me strongly to support Edwards' 

 ■conclusions. And we may add that there are, as I have already said, 

 <letails in the pattern of the dark females which are not explained 

 V)y any other hypothesis. Objections based on the great abundance 

 •of the non-mimetic ancestor are considered on pages 178, 179.

6. The Female of Neophasia terlooti, .«i other North American 

 Mimic of Danaida plexippus. 



Dr. Skinner remarks (34, p. 27): "What is the cause of the ex- 

 traordinary antigeny seen in Neophasia terlooti? The male in thi.s 

 species is white and the female orang(>. The female of the species 

 was once sent to me as a 'little Danais' and it really looks like one- 

 Here would be a good opportunity to build up a mimicry theorj'. " ' 

 At the time when I read these words I had never seen the species, 

 but Dr. Skinner has now very kindly sent me a male and female 

 from Reef, Arizona (Nov. 2, 1903: Biederman). There can be no 

 doubt that the female is a mimic of D. plexippus. The comparison 

 between the yellow of the under surface exposed in the position of 

 rest and the orange of the upper surface, the blackening of the veins 

 on the upper surface of the hind wing antl other details to be de- 

 scribed below arc quite inexplicable on any other hypothesis. The 

 mimicry is rather rough and there is no approximation in the shape 

 of the wings. In both respects this female stands in about the same 

 position as the females of the Neotropical Pcrrhi/bris C'Mylothris"). 

 I am greatly indel)te(l to my friend for this opportunity of examining 

 and writing on what is to me an {-ntirely new example of butterfly 

 mimicry in North America- -another result of its invasion by the 

 Old World genus Danaida. ^ly friend ("onnnander J. .). Walker, 

 who has had an intimate experience of the allied Neophasia menapia 

 in Vancouver Island, tells me th^it during flight the latter is one of the 

 feeblest of Pierines and that it suddenly appears upon the wing in 

 immense numbers. He, has kindly permitted me to make use of the 

 following un])ublished extracts from his journal, on H. M. S. "King- 

 fisher" at Esquimalt, Vancouver Island: 



1882, August 7: "Day still, hot, and cloudless. During the 

 forenoon I was agreeably surprised l\v the ajiiiearance of a good 

 number of specimens of a very pretty "White" butterfly. . . . 

 It seems to come very near to Lencophasia, by the elongate shape 

 and delicate texture of its wings, as well as by the rather short antenna' 

 and hairy palpi. . . . They were flying sluggishly in the .sunshine 

 over the water, and the signalman and I caught 15 on the poop in a 

 very short time (the ship being about 300 yards off shore]. . . . 

 Landed at 4 P. M.; the Leucophasia"! was still on the wing, and I 



'Dr. F. A. Dixpy remarked of N. leitonli in lOO.i {P roceeiUng.i of the Entomn- 

 logicnl Soridy of Lomlon. p. x.\) : "Thi.s lalli-r bullerfly is especially interest iii(r 

 ius po.s.se.s,sinK a female whieh rlosely ri-sembles some of the mimetie forms of 

 E liter jK."

caught 15 or 16 (at flowens of Matricaria), all in the most exquisite 

 •condition, like those taken on board ship. They all appeared to 

 Tiave emerged from the pupa on that day, as I had been on the 

 lookout for some days past, and certainly did not see one on the 

 -vving yesterday." 



August 8: "Went on shore this forenoon at 11.30, to get a few 

 more of the Leuco-phasia [Xeophasia] while it remained in good 



condition I had no difficulty in getting as many as I wanted 



.... a day, however, had made a perceptible difference in its 

 condition, as a good many were getting somewhat worn and chipped. 

 They were very easy to catch, flitting from flower to flower in the 

 open places [among the pines] and of very weak and sluggish flight." 



August 14: The first 9 was taken on this date. "I beat it out 

 of a fir-tree." 



The fact that the only Pierine mimic in the Nearctic Region 

 belongs to a genus with the characteristics described by J. J. Walker 

 ■suggests an interpretation on the lines of Fritz Muller's hypothesis. 



I now propose to institute a detailed comparison between the 

 colored pigments of Neophasia menapia and ierlooti. 



The Female of Neophasia menapia. — Under surface of hind 

 wing.— A colored spot, roughly triangular in shape, is found in the 

 black marginal band of areas 2, 3, 4, ,5, and 6. The spots, as well as the 

 other markings described below, were orange in 4 females, orange-red 

 in 2, and a rather pale vermilion in one. The tint in some individuals 

 tends to deepen towards the base of the wing — especially along the 

 costa. Beyond vein 7, viz., in areas 7 and 8, the pigment is continued 

 at first as a narrow marginal line, which filling area 8 except at its 

 very base, broadens with it toward the base of the wing. In the 

 opposite direction, .beyond vein 2, area Ic bears two spots, of which 

 the upper is sometimes roughly diamond-shaped. These spots 

 are placed one on each side of the dark line, representing a lost vein, 

 which divides the area longitudinally into two sections. Below 

 vein 11) a narrow marginal orange line extends over about | of the 

 l)readth of area lb. 



In addition to these marginal orange markings, there is also an 

 internervular development of the same pigment starting from the 

 base of the wing, especially distinct in the lower or inner marginal 

 section of area Ic, which in favorable examples is highly colored 

 over more .than half its length starting from the base. In strongly 

 marked females a few scattered orange scales are also seen in area 7 

 and in the upper section of area Ic, and they could probably be found 

 in other areas of certain individuals. 




174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Upper surface of hind wing. Most of the al)ovo-described mar- 

 ginal features appear, but far more faintly, on the upper surface. 

 The other orange marks are not represented on the upper surface of 

 those females that I have examined, nor did they appear anywhere 

 upon either surface of the fore wing. 



The Male of Neophasi.^ menapia. — Under surface of hind icing. — 

 Sixteen examples were examined and of these about half had a 

 comparatively few dull orange or sometimes yellow scales in one or 

 more of areas 6, 7, and 8. When present they are precisely in the 

 position of the marginal markings of the female. 



Since writing the above I have had the opportunity of examining 

 6 beautiful specimens from Esquimalt, in Commander J. J. Walker's 

 collection. Well-developed marginal markings appeared on all 

 females: on- (1) a beautiful cinnabar red; on (2) a pale cinnabar 

 red, a little deepened at the anal angle, apex, and costa; on (3) 

 orange, becoming orange-red in the same positions. Of the 3 males, 

 two possessed pale cinnabar scales at the apex and along the costa,. 

 one of them bearing a few at the margin of the upper section of area 

 Ic and still fewer — only 2 or 3 scales — in the lower section. The 

 third male had pale yellow marginal scales at the; apex and costa, 

 a few becoming faintly reddish, especially at the apex. 



Commander Walker tells mo that these butterflies were all "set" 

 immediately after capture, antl that they have never been "relaxed" 

 and "reset. " . Inasmuch as Prof. Gowland Hopkins has shown (ll, 12) 

 that the iiigments of Pierince ace solulile in water, it is jirobable that 

 Walker's specimens more truly represent the colors of the living 

 insect than do any of the others here described, for all of these have 

 been "rela.xed" at least once. 



The Male of Neoph.\.si.^terlooti. — Under surface of hind wing. — 

 The marginal markings of the female menapia are represented on the 

 male of tcrlooti, smaller indeed, but with a far richer color, being of a 

 bright, rich vermilion tint. In the single specimen I have hail the 

 opportunity of examining these markings are solely marginal. They 

 are wanting from area 4 and so slightly develoyx'd in all areas except 

 6, 7, and 8 (where they are ])urely linear and do not fill the last-named 

 area as in the 9 nwnapia) that it would be easy to count the con- 

 stituent scales with a leas. In the specimen before me there are 

 only 3 vermilion scales in area 5 on the left side and only 5 on the 

 right, but they are more numerous and usually far more numerous 

 in all the other markings, .\lthough the dark pigment is com- 

 paratively weakly devclopi'd in the male, area Ic i-: divided very 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 175- 



distinctly by a strongly marked linear streak, and the 2 orange spots 

 of the female menapia are represented by 2 marginal groups of 

 vermilion scales, one in each section of the area. Vermilion scales 

 occur nowhere else on the specimen, although those described above- 

 can be distinctly seen through the translucent scales of the upper 

 surface. 



The Female of Neophasia terlooti. — Under surface of hind 

 wing. — The vermilion markings are developed almost precisely in 

 the positions of the orange markings of the female menapia — more 

 strongly at the margin aiiil the extreme base of the wing, but much 

 less so elsewhere. The lower section of area Ic is, however, richly 

 marked \vith vermilion for | of its length from the liase. The rest 

 of the colored markings are light yellow of an ochreish tint, rather 

 distinctly different from that seen elsewhere on the wings. 



Under surface of fore wing. — The marginal markings and the 

 marginal part of the chief orange patch are also light yellow, but of a 

 lemon tinge. The orange of the chief marking and of scattered 

 .scales forming a linear mark in the cell is very rich and deep in tint: 

 the mark in the cell is in fact better described as orange-red. The 

 two marks at the end of the cell, in areas 5 and 6, are transitional in 

 tint between the yellow marginal and the more central orange 

 markings, and there is transition to be observed between the yellow 

 margin in areas la and lb and the rest of the chief orange marking. 

 These changes in color are effected by a gradual increase in the 

 number of orange scales and not by any real transition between the 

 yellow and orange pigments, although if we study the wings as a 

 whole we find several tints of orange and yellow. 



Upper surface of hind wing. — The vermilion markings are repre- 

 sented by comparatively few scales. Within these markings the 

 submarginal spots and the ground-color of the rest of the wing are 

 deep orange, but of a duller tint than that of the fore wing. The 

 submarginal spots of the outer (hind) margin are slightly less deep 

 in tint, while along the costa, where the surface is concealed beneath 

 the fore wing, the orange scales are gradually replaced by yellow, and 

 again, at the extreme margin, by black, with perhaps a trace of the 

 vermilion which is so distinct on the opposite surface. The vermilion 

 scales could not be properly investigated because of the overlap of 

 the wings. 



Upper surface of the fore wing. — The colors are nearly as on the 

 under surface, but, except at the apex, the submarginal spots and 

 the margin of the principal marking are distinctly less pale and 




176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



therefore much nearer to the tint of the orange ground-color of the 

 Test of the wing. The transition here does not appear to be effected 

 by a gradually increasing number of deep orange scales, but by a 

 gradual increase in the depth of the tint. The two marks at the 

 end of the cell are nearly as rich an orange as in the expanse be- 

 low t4ie cell, and the transition towards yellow is, on the upper 

 surface as compared with the lower, shifted towards the costal 

 margin, occurring in the two spots of the same series placed above 

 the end of the cell in areas 10 and 11. The linear spot in area 11 is 

 yellow with thinly scattered orange scales, which are far mon- thickly 

 placed on the spot in area 10. 



7. The Colored Pigments of the Pierin.e as Illustrated by 



Neophasia. 



Professor F. Gowland Hopkins has shown (11, 13) that the white 

 pigment of Pierines is an impure uric acid, and that the yellow 

 orange and probably the red pigments are a derivative of uric acid 

 which he calls "lepidotic acid. " No pigments of similar constitution 

 were found in any other Ijutterflies. Therefore, when a Pierine 

 mimics an Ithoniiine or, a* in N. tcrluoti. a Dauaine, the resemblance 

 is effected 1)\' tlic jiroduction of an entirely different coloring matter. 

 Clowland Hopkins Ix'iieves that the yellow, orange, and red Pierine 

 pigments are chemically nearly allied and may pass one into the other 

 by slight changes perhaps in the degree of oxidation. He observed 

 that one tint was represented by another in corresponding markings 

 of ojjposite sexes or allietl species. Thus he remarks (Vi, p. G78) : 



"It is interesting to note, by comparing various allied species of 

 Delias, that the red marginal spot may become more yellow, while 

 the yellow area usually found at the root of the wing may l)ecome 

 more red, till both may exhibit a uniform orange colour, or the 

 change may go farther antl red and yellow change ]ilaces without 

 the general color-plan of the wing being altered." 



These conclusions are strongly supported by a careful study of 

 Xcophasin, where it has been shown that in different individuals of 

 the same sex of mcnapia the same markings may be either orange, 

 orange-red, or pale vermilion, while in the opposite sex they may be 

 a!)sent or feebly re])resented in dull orange or yellow. Again in the 

 allied tcrlooti the corresponding markings are a rich deep vermilion 

 in both sexes. We are led to realize that it is very easy for \eophasia 

 to produce any shade between a pale lemon-yellow and a rich ver- 

 milion. The colored markings of meimpia cannot be regarded as 




1-'14.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 177 



mimetic, and, if Danaida plexippus liad never entered America, it is 

 highly improbable that anything- more than the corresponding 

 colored markings would have been evolved on the wings of the female 

 terlooti. The range of tints in the markings common to menapia and 

 terlooti gives an indication of the variational material out of which 

 selection built up the mimetic pattern. The peculiar shade of 

 yellow of the under surface of the hind wing, the rich orange of the 

 central parts of the upper surface, the paler tints of the marginal 

 markings, especially at the apex of the fore wing, the emphasis by 

 black pigment of the veins of the hind wing upper surface, are all 

 elements in producing the result— a somewhat rough but at a distance 

 almost certainly a deceptive mimetic likeness to D. plexippus. 



The same considerations help us to' understand the prevalence of 

 Pierine mimicry in tropical America as compared with other parts 

 of the world— because of the predominant Ithomiinw and Danainw 

 wth warning patterns made up of reds, yellows, whites, and blacks 

 Such patterns are mimicked by the Pierine genera Dismorphia 

 (in the broad sense), Perrhybris {'• Mylothris"), Archonias, Hes- 

 pcrocharis, and wc can now add the North American Neophasia. 



8. The Restriction of Sex-limited Inheritance to the Mimetic 

 Pattern of Neophasia terlooti. 



The older colored markings common to the females of menapia 

 and terlooti are only partially sex-limited, being inherited in a very 

 reducetl form by some of the males of the former species and probably 

 by all of the latter. The more modern mimetic pattern of the 

 female terlooti is strictly sex-limited. The facts harmonize with the 

 hypothesis that female mimicry is largely due to the great variability 

 of this sex in Lepidoptera and the freedom with which it offers to 

 selection a wide range of sex-limited colors and markings, but that 

 when a pattern has been long established it tends to be transferred 

 to the opposite sex. 



The older non-mimetic marginal markings suggest that the trans- 

 formation of uric into lepidotic acid is especially easy in this part 

 of the hind wing and invite comparison with the number of mimetic 

 Neotropical Pierines in which marginal or submarginal reds have 

 been developed in the same position, viz., on the under surface of 

 the hind wing— a study that would carry me too far from the subject 

 of the present paper.

9-. The Evolution of Limenitis (Basilarchia) archippus from 



AN Ancestor with a Pattern like that of 



L. (B.) arthemis. 



The origin of archippus, suggested in the title of this section, is 

 due to Scudder (6, 277-8, 714). All I have done is to support the 

 published views of this distinguished naturalist liy making a careful 

 analysis of the markings of archippus and arthemis, by this means 

 demonstrating that the details of the mimetic pattern are accounted 

 for on his hypothesis. I am sorry to find that neither 8c\idder's 

 hypothesis nor the results of my analysis carry any conviction to 

 Dr. Skinner, who uses the following words: "Arthemis and weide- 

 meyeri [with a very similar pattern] have flourished prosperously in 

 the struggle for existence, and it is difficult to understantl why 

 archippus should be so specially favored. The statements attemjit- 

 ing to prove the evolution of archippus from an ancestral form 

 (arthemis) seem to me very inconclusive" (32, p. 127). Dr. Skinner 

 makes no alternative suggestion as to the origin of the mimetic sjiecies. 

 The doctrine of evolution — for it is hardly necessary to tliscuss the 

 ancient belief which would assume that archippus was originally 

 created in its present form — leaves us only two hypotheses. Either 

 archippus was evolved from some form of Limenitis whit;h has 

 entirely disappeared or from one which is more or less closely repre- 

 sented by a species still in existence. The former alternative aban- 

 dons th(> problem as insoluble, and abandoned it nuist be if there is 

 no sufficient evidence that the ancestor can be reconstructed from any 

 existing form. I agree with Scudder in preferring the counsel of 

 hope to the counsel of despair. L. (B.) arthemis and iceidemeyeri 

 present us with an ancestral pattern wide-spread in the genus and 

 found not only in North America, but also with little change in the 

 Old World section of the temperate circumpolar zone. Archippus 

 is so closely related to arthemis that tlie larval and pu])al stages are 

 almost identical, and although the imaginal patterns are so different, 

 Scudder indicated, and I have attempted to trace in detail, the 

 manner in which one pattern may be derived from the otiier. I 

 really think that if Dr. Skinner, with specimens of archippus and 

 arthemis before him, will verify the details of the account in in>- 

 earlier paper ('il. pp. 4.')(i -I5!t), he will find that many minute 

 features on the wings of the mimetic species are interpreted and 

 correlated in a satisfactory manner. .\nd a hypothesis that interprets 

 stands, until replaced by another that interprets better. 



With regard to Skinner's inference that inasmuch a.< arthemis

flourishes prosperously, it is unlikely that a mimetic form would arise 

 from It, this IS an objection which at once arises when mimicry is 

 studied in the original monograph of its founder, published fong 

 before Fritz Mliller had thought of his hypothesis. According to 

 Bates mimicry wa.s a refuge for the destitute, a last means of escape 

 for a hard-pressed and d>-ing species. It was this very conclusion 

 which was Miiller's stumbling-block; for the majority of the mimics 

 in southeast Brazil where he liyed were clearly "successful and 

 abundant species, and the same is true of the majority of mimickiiip- 

 species wherever they are thoroughly known. Nor is there any reason 

 to suppose that these successful forms originally arose from r'are and 

 hard-pressed non-mimetic ancestors. Want of space preyents the dis 

 cussion of more than a single example. I refer to Tirumala (Mehnda) 

 fonnosa, an Oriental inyader into the Ethiopian Region (i8 31) 

 This species, abundant east of the ^-ictoria Nyanza, near Nairobi,' 

 IS there beautifully mumcked by the Ethiopian Papilio rex The 

 inyading Danaine has transformed an indigenous species just as in 

 North America. ^^ est of the great lake T. fonnosa is represented by 

 an equally flourishing daughter species, T. mercedonia, ^^•ith a pattern 

 darker than its parent and one much further removed from the allied 

 Oriental I)ana.«a.. Papilio rex west of the lake becomes P. nnn^eticus 

 as beautiful a mimic of T. mercedonia as rex is oi formosa. The two 

 Danaine models are now distinct species, but their Papilionine 

 mimics, connected by intermediates {P. commixtus) in the interme- 

 diate geographical area northeast of the Victoria Nyanza are 

 certainly a single interbreeding community. Similarly, in North 

 America Danarda PJ^xippusi. a yery distinct species from D. berer^ice 

 and D. str,go.sa, although these latter may be geographical races of 

 one species The three forms of Lirnenitis J, on tie other hancl 

 all probably mimetic modifications of a single species, although 

 L. obsoleta is probably- distinct from archippus and floridensi. To con- 

 tinue the history of the African invading Danaines: Further- 

 westward the flourishing and pro.sperous T. Mercedonia has given rise 

 to a still darker species, T. morgeni, which has altogether lost the 

 appearance of an Oriental Tirumala and has become the most 

 perfect mimic of the African Danaine genus Amauns

 butterfly of a different family. It gives rise to another species and 

 the mimic undergoes corresponding changes. Finally, in spite of

to arckippus, and I do not think that any naturalist who recognized 

 the traces of the pattern of mercedonia still lingering almost invisible 

 on the surface of viorgeni or concealed by the overlap of the wings 

 would doubt that the former is the ancestor of the latter and that the 

 model has become itself a mimic. 



Finally, it must be remembered that L. archippus has a far ^\-ider 

 range than arthemis, and it is reasonable to suppose that this advan- 

 tage has been conferred by its mimetic pattern. Arthemis is confined 

 to Canada east of the Rockies and to the northeastern States, while 

 archippus is "found over very nearly the same area as Anosia plex- 

 ippus" (6, 278). 



10. The Relation of the Pattern of Limenitis obsoleta (hulsti) 

 to that of archippus, arthemis and weidemeyeri. 



When I wrote the paper criticised by Dr. Skinner (22), as well as 

 an earlier paper, in some respects more detailed (21), I had never 

 been given the opportunity of examining a series of the Arizona 

 and Utah mimic, Limenitis obsoleta (hulsli), and my brief account was 

 founded on the excellent fig. 5 on plate ^'II of Dr. W. J. Holland's 

 work (17.) In January, 1909, when I had the honor of repre- 

 senting my country at the Darwin centcnar\- in America, my friend 

 Dr. F. A. Lucas, Director of the American Museum, Central Park, 

 New York, showed me a series of obsoleta together with its model, 

 Danaida strigosa. The specimens were in the Brooklyn Musomn, 

 of which Dr. Lucas was then Curator. I saw at once that the form 

 was very varial)le and that my work required the study and com- 

 parison of a long series of individuals. Dr. Lucas verj'^ kindly 

 obtained a few specimens of the model and mimic for me and put 

 me in communication with Dr. R. E. Kunze, of Phoenix, Arizona, 

 who has generously provided me with a fine mass of material. The 

 following account has been drawai up from the study of 24 males and 

 9 females from Plucnix and 2 males and 1 female from Tucson. 

 Thirty-three specimens bear the precise date of capture, one the 

 month and year, one a month of which the interpretation is uncertain, 

 and one for whicli the month is not recorded. Omitting the.se last 

 two, the dates of capture are given in the following tal>le. The three 

 1896 specimens were captured at Tucson (2,400 feet) in southern 

 Arizona, the remaining 31 at Pha'nix (1,100 feet) in the valley of the 

 Salt River, southern Arizona.

The existence of two broods, one emerging between the end of 

 March and the end of April, the other in September and October, 

 are clearly showai. The two specimens in June and Jul}', respectively, 

 were probably representatives of a third brood. 



The model, Danaida strigosa, appears to be much rarer than its 

 munic at Phoenix — at any rate, in the localities where Dr. Kunze 

 collected. From this place I have only received 2 males, captured 

 July 2 and 6, 1912; from Tucson — 1 female May 26, 1 male June 7, 

 1 female June 9, 1 male August 19, all in 1896; from Prescott (5.400 

 feet), in western Arizona — 2 males and 1 female July 15, 1912. 



Dr. R. E. Kunze, of Phoenix, Arizona, who has had a long and 

 intimate experience of the butterfly fauna of the State, kindly informs 

 me that, in the Phoenix (1,100 feet) and Tucson (2,400 feet) districts 

 and between them, L. obsoleta is almost exclusively found in the 

 valleys, along the river-bottoms, and by the canals, where its larval 

 food-plant, a willow, grows.^ It is commoner in the river-bottoms, 

 especially near the streams, than by the canals. Danaida strigosa 

 flies with it in these situations and is indeed commoner there than 

 elsewhere, but, unlike the mimic, it is also found in other places. 

 It is impossible to state the relative proportions of Danaine and 

 Limenitis, but by the rivers and canals the mimic is the commoner 

 in the ratio of about twelve or fifteen to one. The proportions at 

 Tucson and Phoenix seem to be the same. 



Danaida plexippus occurs, but is scarce in the Salt River valley at 

 Phoenix. Dr. Kunze estimates that it may exist in the ratio of one 

 to fifteen of D. strigosa, but in some seasons he does not meet with 



- The armatures of two of these males were studied by Dr. Eltringham (p. 190) . 



^ Dr. Kunze adds in his letter of August 5, 191.3: "I should say that ohsolda 

 has here [Phcenixl from 3-4 broods in a season, from April 1st up to November 

 1st, in a mild autumn, of course. I think the last brood oviposits on cotton- 

 wood, our Populus fremonti and other species, because its leaves" keep green till 

 latter part of December, whereas willow drops leaves earher. "

it at all. At Prescott, Arizona (5,350 feet), 135 miles north of 

 Phoeni.x, striyom flies in the company of plexippus from July to 

 September, the latter being the commoner of the two. D. strigosa 

 extends as far south as Galveston, Texas, and may also occur in some 

 ]Darts of Mexico, near the northern boundary. Limenitis obsoleta 

 does not occur at Prescott. 



Tlie fine series of L. obsoleta {hulsti) tabulated on p. 180 at once 

 made clear to me that the Arizona form is not, like floridensis (eras) 

 in Florida, a local race of L. archippus transformed by mimicry of 

 the dominant local Danaine, but the bearer of an ancestral pattern 

 which preserves features lost by the two other mimetic races. I 

 therefore desire to correct my former conclusion, founded -on the 

 figure of a single specimen, that obsoleta is a modified form of archippus 

 (21, p. 460, 22, pp. 171-2). At the same time I remarked in the 

 latter paper (p. 172) : "I have not yet had the opportunity of ascer- 

 taining whether this hypothesis is supported by evidence derived 

 from a careful .study of the pattern." 



The hind wing. — The most prominent ancestral features of obsoleta 

 are the traces of the white discal band derived from an ancestor with 

 a pattern like that of arthcmis or weidemeycri. In archippus and 

 floridensis a trace of the white band is found on the under side of the 

 hintl wing in some specimen-^, but so far as my experience goes never 

 on the upper surface. In obsoleta some ti'ace of it is always present 

 on both .surfaces, but when, as in the majority of specimens, there 

 is a difference in the degree of. development, it is stronger upon the 

 under side. It is more strongly developed in the females than the 

 males, and this is the general rule with the ancestral features of the 

 .species, as it appears to be in archippus, of which a certain ]in>i)(irti()ii 

 of the males in the Albany ilistrict, but ni) fenudes, iiavc entirely 

 lost the black discal .stripe from the upper surface of the IiIikI wing 

 (recorded by Mr. John H. Cook, 22, pp. 211-212). Thus the white 

 stripe, together with its black outer bortier, is evanescent on the upper 

 surface of the hind wing of 2 female obsoleta from Phoenix and small 

 in the female from Tucson, whereas the same feature is evanescent 

 in half the males from Phoenix and but slightly develojjed in others. 

 The evanescent feature in both males and females is more strongly 

 represented, generally far more strongly, on the under surface. The 

 degree of development of the black band is generally related to that 

 of the white, the two being usually evanescent together or well 

 develojicd together, but the range of variation is much greater in the 

 white than in the black, corresjjonding with the entire disappearance 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 183 



of the former but not of the latter from the upper surface of the 

 allied archippus. On the other hand, the development on the under 

 as compared with the upper surface is greater in the black than the 

 white. In both sexes there is a tendency, as in mrhippus, to throw 

 the while spots on the under surface of the hind wing into relief by 

 an inner edging — a darkened shade of the ground-color in areas 

 2, 3, 4, and 5, still darker and often black in areas 6 and 7. This 

 feature probably represents the black inner border of the white 

 discal band in the non-mimetic ancestor. 



When the 32 specimens, omitting the 2 taken in June and July, 

 recorded in the table on p. 180, are arranged according to their two 

 broods — the 15 March and April specimens together and the 17 

 September and October together — it is seen that there is a small but 

 distinct seasonal difference in the development of the trace of the 

 white discal band of the hind wing and its black outer border. The . 

 spring brood is in this respect distinctly the more ancestral, bearing 

 on the average stronger traces of the pattern of weidemeyeH and 

 arthemis. This is true of the females as well as the males, as may be 

 inferred from the following statement : 



Females {spring brood = 4-, autjiinn brood = 5). — The only 2 

 specimens with evanescent band and border bear the dates Sept. 11, 

 1911, and Oct. 10, 1910. The most reduced band of the spring brood 

 is seen in the Tucson specimen, April 9, 1896. In all the remaining 

 4 spring females, the band and, in all l)ut one, the border is distinctly 

 stronger than in either of the 2 remaining autumn females. 



Males {spring hrood = 10, autumn brood = IS). — It is extremely 

 difficult to classify the degree of development of the band and border 

 — there is a complete and gradual transition. There is, however, a 

 marked difference at both ends of the scale between the two broods. 

 The most evanescent white bands are seen in 6 autumn males. In 

 all these the feature is more reduced than in any spring male. Very 

 small and reduced bands are found in 3 males of each brood. Beyond 

 these there is the most gradual transition to the highest degree of 

 development found in the sex, and among these we find by far the 

 highest in a specimen captured April 22, 1911, while 2 other spring 

 males are rather beyond an.y of the autumn brood. Considering 

 the black border separately, the difference is even more marked, for 

 this feature is evanescent in 4 of the autumn brood and none of the 

 spring, while the next 4 are equalled and on the whole slightly 

 exceeded by the 4 spring specimens in which the feature is least de- 

 veloped. The black border is more highly developed in 4 of the spring 




184 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



brood than in any of the autiann. This detailed comparison has 

 been extraordinarily difhcult to make, because of the perfect transi- 

 tion and the minute shades of difference. When the attempt was 

 made to express the difference, the specimens grouped themselves 

 into fours in an irritating and unnatural manner. It might perhaps 

 have been wiser to attempt no analysis of so transitional a feature, 

 but to be contented with the statement that a distinct difference 

 exists at both ends of the scale, the band and border of the most 

 strongly marked specimens being decidedly more developed in the 

 spring brood, while the reduction of these features in the least strongly 

 marked specimens was carried distinctly further in the autumn 

 brood. I cannot but think, however, that my attempts at an 

 analytical comparison, whatever faults there may be in the details, 

 are a truer expression of the facts. 



An interesting difference between the upper surface of obsolcta 

 and that of archippus is common to both fore and hind wings, viz., 

 the far more heavily blackened veins gained by the latter in mimicry 

 of D. plexippus. Floridensis here shows its origin from archippus, 

 for it retains the darkening along the veins, although out of place in a 

 mimic of D. berenice. No such evidence of having passed through an 

 archippus stage is to be seen on the upper surface of obsolcta. The 

 veins are heavily blackened on the under surface of the hind wing 

 in all three mimics, in evident likeness to their respective models, 

 although ob.sokta in this respect is less darkened and a less perfect 

 mimic than the other two. 



In certain specimens of obsoletn there is to l)e seen on the hind wing 

 under surface two largish rich brown sharply outlined jjatches, one in 

 the cell and one near the base of area 7. On the basal side of each 

 patch is a white spot and a white suffusion commonly surrounds the 

 projection of the precostal into area 8. These elements tenti to 

 become evanescent together and distinct together, acting like a single 

 feature. Slight traces of these markings can probably be f<tund on 

 every fresh specimen. They were remarkably pronounced in the 

 female taken Sept. 5, 1911 (p. 181). These vestiges, except in one 

 respect, resemble the well-known basal pattern of cirthemis far more 

 closely than that of wcidcmeyeri . The pale elements arc, however, 

 for the most part blue in arlhemis, but nearly white in weidemeyeri, 

 and therefore in this respect nearer to obsolcta. Archippus has 

 advanced further from the ancestral forms than obsolcta, for "the 

 ba.'ial red patches have vanished, but the pale blue mark-s in and on 

 the costal side [area 7] of the base of the cell are retained, and, 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 185 



lightened in tint, represent the two more con.spicuou.s white spot.* 

 occupying nearly the same pasition in Anosia [Danaida]" (31, 456-7). 

 Now that I have had the advantage of studying obsoleta, and have 

 re-examined archippiis in the light of the new experience, I find that 

 a few examples do possess a very faint trace of the reddish patches of 

 arthemis. In these vestiges as in so many other features in the pattern 

 we are led to conclude that obsoleta represents an older stage in the 

 evolution of archippus. 



The fore wing. — The inner edge of the angulated black outer 

 border of the white band of arthemis and weidemeyeri runs from the 

 costa to the inner margin of the wing, near but well within the pos- 

 terior angle, although it is broadened so far that its outer edge enter.* 

 this angle; in most specimens of archippus it ruas to the junction of 

 the middle and posterior third of the outer (hind) margin (31, « 

 p. 457). Some females, however, approach the condition of obsoleta, 

 which is generally far nearer in this respect to the pattern of arthemis 

 and weidemeyeri. In obsoleta the direction of the vestigial black 

 outer border, which, except near the costa, is evanescent on the 

 upper surface, can be easily traced by fixing the attention on the 

 outer ends of the four prominent white spots in areas 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

 With this as guide, the eye is led on to an evanescent white spot nearly 

 always present in area 2, and in certain individuals to the faint 

 continuation of the black line towards the posterior angle. The 

 angle made with the costa is very different from that of archippus. 

 The black line is usually far more distinct on the under surface, and 

 here it may be seen in many specimens that the direction changes 

 abruptly in area lb, becoming parallel with the outer margin and 

 leading to a termination on the inner margin wdthin, and often well 

 within the posterior angle. In well-marked specimens, especially 

 in the females, the black line is seen to lead to the outer end of a white 

 linear mark close to the inner margin in area la (see p. 186). Faint 

 vestiges of the former white band can even be made out in lb on 

 the under surface of a few individuals. There is great variation in 

 the position of the black line in lb. In most males it unites witli 

 and continues as a broadening of the black margin. 



The white spots which represent the costal half of the white band 

 of arthemis and weidemeyeri are far better developed in obsoleta than 

 in archippus. In the latter the spots are 2 to 4 in number, the last 

 being very small. In obsoleta there are always 4 large and distinct 

 spots, especially well developed in the female, while a minute otli 

 spot, already mentioned as placed in area 2, is nearly always present 




186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



and often more strongly marked on the under surface. A trace of it 

 •could be made out on the upper .surface of all the females and on 17 

 of the males; from one or both sides of the remaining males it was 

 .absent, but it is likely that when these were fresh examination with 

 a lens would have led to the detection of a few white scales. It is 

 clear that the trace of the original discal band is more shortened in 

 <irchippus than in the Arizona form, and that the 4th spot in area 3, 

 •or in other individuals the 3rd in area 4, is now in the position of the 

 minute trace of a 5th spot in area 2 of obsoleta. Furthermore, the 

 l^lack di.scal marking retains in obsoleta more of its original appearance 

 as an outer edging to the white band than in archipijus — an appear- 

 ance still more fully sustained upon the hind wing. In the fore wing 

 of archippus it is obviously much developed, es]5ecially at the costal 

 end, in mimicry of the model ])lcxippus. 



The trace, on the costa itself, of the anterior end of the white band 

 of the fore wing, already described as generally to Vie found in archip- 

 pus ('il. y). 4.57), was present in all the females and 19 males of 

 .obsoleta. but in some of these it was barely visible. This feature is 

 a|)])arently more often wanting altogether from archippus. but the 

 two forms have reached nearly the same level, and I think that in 

 both examination with a lens would rcve;d the presence of some 

 trace of the marking in most or ])erhap.s all fresh sii(>cimens. 



I have already incidentally mentioned on p. 18.5 the most inter- 

 esting ancestral feature in the fore-Aving pattern of obsoleta, and one 

 entirely wanting from nrchippii.<<, viz., a <listinct trace in area la of 

 the inner marginal end of a white discal band like that of arthemis 

 or weidemeyeri. This linear mark was present, varying in the 

 degree of its devel()])m<'nt, in all the females and 23 males, and 

 traces might probably have been found on all when fre.sh. The 

 mark is also to be found on the under surface where the fore wing is 

 overla])ped by the hind, but for this rea.-<on it wa-s only examined in 

 a few specimens; in these it did not stand out on the paler ground- 

 color as conspicuously as on the upper surface. It has been already 

 ]iointcd out on j). 18.5 that the outer end of the mark coincides with 

 the point tm the inner margin indicated by the direction of the 

 vestige of the black outer border in some individuals, viz., a point 

 ^^^^'\\ within the posterior angle of the fore wing. In a single female 

 (Apr. 17, 1909), unfortunately rather worn, the mark in la appar- 

 ently extends to the black margin at the posterior angle. The 

 same relationship to a mark st<)i)])ing short of the angle is also 

 ndicated, es|)ecially in fresh s])ccinicn-; of the female, by a distinctly 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 187 



palpr shade of the ground-color outside the discal l)lack stripe on 

 l)oth surfaces of both wings. The change of shade follows the 

 suggested direction of the black line to the inner margin of the fore 

 wing, although near this border it is not sharply demarcated as on 

 the rest of the wing. Such an abrupt change in the depth of the 

 color is very rarely to be seen on the upper surface of archippus. 

 Scudder has looked on the reddish spots of arthemis, occupying the 

 very position of this paler shade in obsoleta, as the foundation from 

 which the mimetic form arose (6, p. 714), and I have followed him 

 (21, 23). If we are right, and the transformation occurred first in 

 this area and only later in the area inside the white discal stripe, it is 

 easy to understand why there should be a difference in the shade of 

 the ground-color for natural selection to seize upon. The Arizona 

 Danaida striyosa is also paler on the outer than it is on the inner part 

 •of the wings, although the transition is gradual and not sharp as in 

 ■obsoleta. On the under surface of the fore wing archippus is, in this 

 very respect, more strikingly ancestral than obsoleta, the pattern of 

 the model having been such as to emphasize the feature. Archippus 

 is also commonly ancestral as compared with obsoleta in the distinct 

 indication by a reddish-brown tint of the red submarginal spots on 

 the under surface of both wings (21, p. 456). 



The white mark in area la of the fore wing has this further interest, 

 that it indicates the point at which the outer edge of the discal 

 liantl of the hind wing met that of the fore, reconstructing for us a 

 pattern like that of weidemeijeri and arthemis in which the band of 

 the hind wing is placed much further from the outer margin than it is 

 in the other wing. The evolution of the marginal pattern of botli 

 surfaces of both wings of obsoleta from a condition like that of arthemis 

 appears to have been the same as in archippus (21, pp. 456-459) and 

 to have reached nearly the same result. The slight differences cor- 

 respond Avith those between the respective models and are doubtless 

 ■due to mimicry. 



The two white spots in the fore wing cell on the under side were 

 present in all the males of obsoleta. The females showed greater 

 variability, the basal spot l^eing sometimes absent, but generally 

 much larger than in the males. On the upper surface of the same 

 wing thedi-stal spot was large, for this feature, in 6 females, small in 3, 

 minute in 1. In 14 males it was sharp and distinct, though small, 

 .and it could be detected in 8 of the others. In the remainder the 

 triangular black mark in which the white .spot lies could be made 

 out by looking carefully for it. White scales were probably origin-

ally present on this mark in some of the worn specimens that do not 

 now possess them. This white spot can be far more frequently 

 detected on the upper surface of obsoleta and archippus than on that 

 of aHhemis and probably more often than in weidermeyeri, although 

 it may attain great relative size in this species (31, PI. XXV, fig. 1), 

 Its frequent appearance in the two mimics points to an origin from 

 an ancestor of the existing North American species that was in 

 this respect nearer in pattern to L. lorquini, in which the spot is 

 almost invariably well developed (31, 479, 480, PI. XXV, figs. 6-8). 

 At the same time the redevelopment of an ancestral feature by means 

 of mimicrj' must not be lost sight of as a probable interpretation. 

 The pattern of D. strigosa is such that the spot in the fore-wing cell 

 of obsoleta probably adds to the likeness, at any rate during flight. 

 The strong development of the feature in the females — in this species 

 the more ancestral sex — favors the former hypothesis. As regard.s 

 the traces of the Limejiilis pattern persisting in the fore-wing cell 

 on the under surface and their transference to the upper surface, 

 obsoleta and archippus have reached nearly the same stage. The 

 most .strongly marked individuals of the former are, however, more 

 ancestral, in that the white spot on the upper surface and the two 

 spots below are larger and more conspicuous than in anj- examples 

 of archippus. 



The seasonal ilifferences on the fore wing were not so well marked 

 as on the hind. Furthermore, the relationship was reversed, the 

 autumn brood being more ancestral than the spring. The difference, 

 however, was barely tletectal)le except In one feature where it was 

 very distinct — the minute white spot in the fore-wing cell. This was 

 sharp and distinct in 11 out of 13 autumn males and only 2 out of 

 10 spring males. It was also on the whole lii-tter tleveloped in the 

 autunm females. 



Temperature experiments on the pupte and, if possible, on the 

 ova and larva> woukl be well worth trying on this form as well as on 

 archippus and jloridensis. Considering what has been done by 

 Dorfmeister, Weismann, Merrifielil, and Standfuss, remembering 

 also that Lamborn has r(>cently brought evidence which suggest*,, 

 although it does not prove, that ve.stiges of "tails" can i)e brought 

 back to the hind wings of the tailless mimetic females of Papilio 

 dardanus (36), it is (luite prol)able that some increase in tiie pattern 

 deriveil from a non-mimetic ancestor might be iniluced by the shock 

 of heat or cold applied to the pupal or both larval and ])ui)al stages. 

 And the fact that there are ccrtainlv some seasonal ditTerences in the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 189 



ancestral elements of L. obsoleta renders such experiments especially 

 hopeful. 



An experiment made by Edwards and quoted by Scudder (6, p. 278) 

 is also encouraging. The black band of the hind wing of archippus 

 was widened in two butterflies which emerged from pupae subjected 

 to cold, being in one specimen, a female, nearly three times the 

 normal width. 



It is necessary, in conclusion, to point out in a few words some 

 .special effects of the Danaine model, D. strigosa. Most prominent 

 among these is the peculiar shade of the ground-color of obsoleta, 

 so different from that of archippus and floridensis and so strikingly 

 like that of the model. The triangular shape of the discal spots of 

 the fore wing, especially pronounced in those of areas 3 and 4, has 

 ■evidently been produced in mimicrj- of the characteristic-looking 

 triangular and diamond-shaped spots of the model. The direction 

 ■of the line of these spots in obsoleta which has been shown on p. 185 

 to be more ancestral, viz., more like that of arthemis and weide- 

 meyeri, than in archippus, has doubtless been stereotyped by the 

 model, in which four of the most conspicuous white spots in areas 

 lb, 2, 3, and 4 are parallel with the outer margin of the fore wing. 

 It is also probable, as suggested in a former paper (21, p. 460), that 

 the retention of the white spots representing the discal band on the 

 liind T\'ing upper surface, and it may be added the linear mark in 

 area la of the fore wing, has been aided by "a general likeness " 

 [during flight] "to the pale-streaked hind-wings of strigosa." Here, 

 too, the relative development of the feature in the female favors 

 a different interpretation; for, as already pointed out (p. 182), 

 the female is slightly the more ancestral and the male the more 

 advanced mimic in this species. The fact that the traces of the 

 black border of the white discal band, which undoubtedly interfere 

 with the mimetic resemblance, on the whole follow the white spots 

 in the degree of development (p. 182) is also in favor of the sup- 

 position that the entire marking is an ancestral feature which has 

 not j'et been got rid of. 



In order to prove that obsoleta is, as its pattern strongly suggests, 

 ancestral as compared with archippus — that it stands in a position 

 intermediate between the latter form atid the non-mimetic species 

 of Limenitis — arthemis and weide7neyeri — it is necessary to seek for 

 .another line of evidence.

11. The Male Genital Armature of the North American- 

 Forms OF Limenitis. 



In former years I have felt, with many other naturalists, some 

 suspicion of the conclusions based on a study of the male genitalia 

 of Lepidoptera. The organs are so complex and in parts so thin- 

 walled, so liable to be deformed by twisting and pressure, that it 

 seemed unlikely that they could escape alteration in the processes of 

 manipulation and mounting. Their shapes are such that a slight 

 difference in the angle at which a drawing is made or a photograj)!! 

 taken makes all the difference to the result. I have, however, bet^n 

 converted by my experience of the work of my friends Dr. Karl 

 Jordan and Dr. H. Eltringham. I have seen the latter naturalist 

 preparing and studying the same parts in different inilividuals again 

 and again until he was able to determine with complete certainty 

 the actual form that is characteristic of the species or race. I there- 

 fore asked him if he would kindly help me by preparing and drawing 

 the genitalia of the North American forms of Limenilis. In asking 

 this favor, I wa.s, all unconsciously, making read}' for a most valuable 

 test of the validity of the method and its results. At the time when 

 Eltringham made his drawings we had no copy of Bcudder's great 

 work (6) available, but, when they were finished, I borrowed the 

 volumes from the library of the Entomological Society of Lonrlon. 

 I turned at once to Plate 33, representing the genitalia of the Canadian 

 and eastern North American .species of Litnenitis, and found that 

 the four figures (9, 11, 12, 15), prepared by Edward Burgess for 

 Scuddcr, might almost have been cojiied from Eltringham's drawings 

 or the drawings from the figures ! Two careful pieces of work carried 

 out independently have led to precisely the same result. It will 

 therefore be admitted that we may safely accept the six figures on 

 the accompanying Plate V as the expression of the true structural 

 relationships in the different species. 



Figures 4, .'), and (i on the right side of Plate V represent the 

 male genital armatures of species, also figvired by Scuddcr, save 

 that his L. astyannx (fig. 1.")) rejjresents the eastern race and Eltring- 

 ham's (fig. 4) that from .Vrizona. Hut the form of the genitalia is 

 nearly the same, as may be .seen by comparing the figures, allowing 

 of course for the difference in magnification. p]ltringham's figures 

 also show witii Scudder's the dose resemblance between nslyannx 

 and arlhemis (fig. 5, Scudder's fig. 9). The two repre.sentations 

 of L. archippus are almost identical, save that Scudder (figs. 11 and 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



12) represents the end of the terminal hook as obliquely truncated, 

 Eltringham (fig. 6) as a simple point. 



Figures 1, 2, and 3 on the left of the plate represent forms of 

 Limenitis from an area outside the limits of Scudiler's monograph. 

 The claspers of L. lorquini (fig. 1) are seen to differ markedly from 

 those of all the other forms. Weidemeyeri (fig. 2), on the other 

 hand, closely resembles arthemis and astyanax, although it is of a 

 stouter build. The main interest of the series of figures is, however, 

 concentrated in obsoleia (fig. 3). Just as the pattern of this species 

 was seen to be intermediate in many details between that of archippus 

 on the one hand and arthemis and weidemeyeri on the other, so is it 

 with the form of its claspers. To make sure that the appearance 

 represented in fig. 3 was not an individual peculiarity, Dr. Eltring- 

 ham made a second preparation, but with precisely the same results. 

 The comparison between figs. 2 and 3 suggests that the mimetic 

 form arose from an ancestral species with claspers more like those of 

 weidemeyeri than arthemis. Looking at these figures, some natural- 

 ists may be inclined to suppose that obsoleta sprang from iveidemeyeri 

 in the southwest, while archippus developed independently from 

 arthemis in the east and north. Such a conclusion seems to me 

 improljable. It is unlikely that independent lines of evolution 

 would have led to structures with the essential similarity that is to 

 be recognized between the forms shown in figs. 3 and 6 — I refer 

 especially to the hook below and the strong teeth above the end of 

 the organ — and still more improbable that such independent evolu- 

 tion would have led to the resemblances in minute detail that have 

 been shown to exist between the patterns of obsoleta and archippus. 



Remembering that these conclusions are founded on small differ- 

 ences between organs that are themselves very variable. Dr. Eltring- 

 ham has confirmed his results by making prepai'ations from 3 indi- 

 viduals of archippus, 2 of obsoleta, 2 of weidemeyeri, and 2 of astyanax 

 arizoiwnsis. He finds that the fine points or teeth are not only 

 variable in different individuals, but that they vary on the two sides 

 of the same individual. This he has shown by the careful drawings 

 reproduced on Plate V, where this want of symmetry is apparent 

 in nearly all the figures. The second specimen of weidemeyeri ha.s 

 rather fewer teeth than the one figured. In a single specimen of 

 archippus floridensis (eros) the organs were somewhat larger than in 

 archippus and the clasper points were a little less acute. In spite of 

 great individual variability and the want of symmetry, the clasper.s 

 of the individuals shown in Plate V exhibit recognizable characters

common to other individuals of each species examined by Eltringham 

 und, as regartls three of them, by Burgess. 



Knowing my own want of experience in the comparative study 

 of these male abdominal appendages, I submitted Dr. Eltringham's 

 drawings to my friend Dr. Jordan, who wrote, Aug. 15, 1913: "Archip- 

 pus appears to be a later modification of obsoleta. as you say. Adyanax 

 orizonensis, tveidemeyeri, and arthemis arc also closely related to one 

 another."' Dr. Eltringham also agrees that the comparative .study 

 of the armatures suj^ports the conclusions arrived at from a study 

 of the patterns. 



Considering together pattern and the structure of the claspers, 

 there are strong reasons for believing that the mimetic forms arose 

 from a North American Limenitis with the pattern of arthemis and 

 iceidemeyeri, but including a white spot in the fore-wing cell upper 

 side now seen most conuuonly in lorquini among North American 

 species, and with claspers like those of weid^meyeri and arthemis, 

 but prol)ably nearer to the former. 



• I trust that Dr. Skinner will coasider that this evolutionary 

 history, if not convincing before, has been rendered so by the fresh 

 evidence now produced. 



12. Similar Environmental Conditions versus IMiMirRV as an 

 Interpretation of Color Resembl.vnces. 



With regard to the resemblance of Limenitis (Basilarchia) flori- 

 densis to Danaida bereriice in Florida and of L. (B.) obsoleta {hulsti) 

 to D. strigosa in Arizona, Skinner suggests (32, p. 127) that ".similar 

 environmental conditions explain these color reseml)lances better 



' The remainder of Dr. Karl Jordan's letter contained an interesting and 

 suggestive {Titici.sin of Scudder's conclusion that proserpina is a hybrid between 

 arthemis and aali/anax. 



"The difTerences in the genitalia between iiMifavaT and nrlhemis might render 

 copulation a little diflirult, but are too insignificant to prevent it. .\ccording 

 to .Scuddcr, iimxtrpina is tlie hybrid between axlyiiKnx and arlhcmix. If that is 

 the ease, the genitalia should be intermediate. As they are identical (te-ste 

 Scudder) with those of the northern insect, I do not believe that proserpina is a 

 hybrid. The offspring of a 9 pmserpina were partly proserpina, partly arthi-mis. 

 This al.so points in the direction that astyanax ha.s no part in the production of 

 jiroscrpina. Scudder appears to rely particularly on this point — proserpina 

 inclini-s towards aslyanax where the latter prevails, and towards arthemin in the 

 places where this in.scci is abundant. But .such an agreement in coloration may 

 simply be due to the two occurring side by side. It is not neces.sarily evidence 

 for hybridization. I have only l<M>ked at Scudder's book, not at the specimens; 

 my opinion is therefore worth very little, but 1 incline to the belief that arthemis 

 a.ssumcs the pattern of nstyanai where it comes into contact with the latter, i.e., 

 that proserpina is a southern modification of arthemis, not a hybrid. It would 

 lie aiivi.sable, however, to examine the genitalia of a series of specimens of all 

 t!iree insects." 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 193 



than the hypothesis of mimicry." He does not venture to suggest 

 this interpretation for the resemblance of L. (B.) archippus to Danaida 

 plexippus; for the great environmental changes endured by both 

 model and mimic in their extensive north and south range make any 

 such suggestion untenable. With regard to the detailed likeness of 

 three forms of Limenitis to three Danaine butterflies in North America, 

 I may fairly retaliate on my friend and point out in his own words, 

 mutatis mutandis, that "it seems logical to consider that they are 

 governed by a general law rather than that two of them, but not the 

 third, are caused by similar environmental conditions." I have 

 already many years ago dealt with this supposed interpretation of 

 mimetic resemblance by an appeal to the forces of the environment, 

 and the arguments then brought forward (15) have, so far as I am 

 aware, never been met. Dr. Skinner does not attempt to meet 

 them, nor does he even allutle to the peculiarly strong evidence 

 furnished by these very North American mimics against the hypothe- 

 sis of enviromnental conditions. Although this evidence is clearly 

 set forth in the paper which Dr. Skinner was discussing (23), as well 

 as in earlier publications of mine (16, 31), I will repeat the substance 

 of it on the present occasion. 



The three Danaines of North America are modern invaders from 

 the Old World, quite isolated and out of place in the New, while the 

 genus Limenitis is an ancestral element in the North American 

 fauna. My own experience of insect systematics is very limited, 

 and I could not with any confidence or authority attempt to weigh 

 the value of characters which have been described as generic. Know- 

 ing these limitations only too well, I applied 'to my friend Dr. K. Jordan, 

 and he, after making fresh investigations into the male genitalia 

 and carefully studying Moore's generic characters, came to the 

 conclusion that the Old World Limnas and Salatura and the New 

 World Anosia and Tasitia could not be sustained as separate genera, 

 but that all four were to be properly included in the single genus 

 Danaida. This genus is nearly related to several much-mimicked 

 groups of Danaince in the Old World, but the two species from which 

 the few American geographical forms have been derived are aliens 

 in the New World. 



Dr. G. B. Longstaff has recently shown that in the gregarious 

 instinct, as manifested by hanging in festoons and clusters from trees, 

 the Old World Danaida genutia (plexippus) resembles its New World 

 representative D. plexippus (37, pp. 7.5, 76), in which the same habit 

 has often been observed (6, pp. 730, 734-7) 

 13 




194 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jan., 



Even in pattern there is but little difference between the most 

 nearlj' allied Asiatic and American species of Danaida, and if, as 

 Dr. Skinner believes, color and pattern are the expression of environ- 

 mental conditions, then they are the expression of an Old World, and 

 not of a New \\'orld environment. On Dr. Skinner's view, the 

 Old World invader, when it became exposed to the new environment, 

 should have come to resemble the New World resident. Instead 

 of this, the resident has come to resemble the invader. 



In concluding the present paper I may quote an opinion expressed 

 to me by Professor Svante Arrhenius. A few years ago I asked my 

 friend whether he thought it possible to explain by the incidence of 

 physico-chemical forces, such as those of the environment, the super- 

 ficial resemblance of one form to another when that resemblance 

 required, as in the development of a complex pattern, the co-opera- 

 tion of many different factors. He replied, as I expected, that he 

 did not consider the explanation possible; for the building up of such a 

 likeness was inconceivable except by the aid of selection. This wa.s the 

 argument I advanced in 1898 (15), after an analysis which showed that 

 mimetic resemblance often requires the co-operation of many different 

 factors; and it was a great satisfaction to find the conclusion con- 

 firmed by an authority with Professor Arrhenius' l)road outlook on 

 the sciences in their relation to one another and to mathematics.

DESCRIPTION OF A TSANTSA IN THE ETHNOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF THE 

 ACADEMY, WITH NOTES ON ANOTHER SPECIMEN. 



BY H. NEWELL W.\RDLE. 



The little raummified human heads, known by their native name 

 of tsantsa, and made by the Jibaro tribes dwelling in the eastern 

 Andean valleys around the head waters of the Amazon, have been 

 known to science for half a century, '■ yet the specimens are still 

 sufficiently rare for each to merit a full description. 



The Academy has recently received a fine tsantsa, as a gift from 

 Dr. Thomas Biddle (Plate VI). It was formerly in the po.ssession of 

 the Museum- Umlauff of Hamburg, and bears the tag of that insti- 

 tution with the inscription, 



"h No. No. 82G 



23182 Equador- ^ 



ivaros. 



The head is in fine condition, the flesh l^eing firm and hard, though 

 apparently not brittle.. 



The skin is devoid of wrinkles, despite the excessive shrinkage it 

 has undergone. It shows that peculiar chocolate-brown tone 

 characteristic of the tsantsa, the portions in relief, .such as lips, 

 nostrils, and zygoma, being highlj' polished and lighter in color, with 

 a distinctly reddish tinge. There are no traces of tattooing observ- 

 able.

possesses the characteristic, narrow, elongated form, with strongly 

 marked prognathism and considerable asymmetrj-. 



Behind the temples is the usual deep depression, which, especially 

 on the right side, almost amounts to a breaking in of the surface, 

 and gives to the forehead a somewhat conical form. The whole 

 facial region also is narrow and flattened laterally. The cheeks, 

 while not sunken, are depressed below the level of the zygomatic 

 arch and of the muscles of the mouth. 



The eyebrows are apparently asj'mmetrical in the arrangement 

 of the hairs — the right supercilium having its inner corner close to 

 the glabella, while that of the left is well round toward the side. 

 The head would seem to have suffered loss at these points during 

 the process of preparation. The hairs are comparatively short — 

 4 to 5 mm. in length. Considering the great contraction of the 

 piliferous tissue, the growth is not heavy. No eyelashes are visible. 



The eyelids have been inverted and stitched together, the stitches 

 from the right eye being continu(>(l to close a gash on the right surface 

 of the root of the nose. The line of the crack is traceable across the 

 root of the nose to a corresponding break on the left side which is 

 not sewed. This is found in other tsantsas and doubtless results 

 from the method of preparation which forces the nose forward and 

 upward. 



The naso-buccal region is strongly projected, which, together 

 with the slightly receding chin, give^ to the lower faci- a snout-like 

 aspect. •' '.. 



The nostrils, which are rudely circular and distended, are directed 

 almost .straight to the front, in a manner suggestive of a double- 

 barreled gun. The orifices show a sufficient supply of vibrissae. 

 The s('])tum has been liroken away in the interior of the nasal passage, 

 whicii extends straight backward into the cavity of the head. The 

 contour of the nose shows a moderate convexity between root and tip. 



The lii)s are proportionately heavy and are pressed forward in a 

 horizontal curve and held together by three vertical stitches of 

 vegetable cord. The holes through which these cords pass are 

 circular, as if made with an awl, or kept open during the shrinkage 

 process by round skewers, such as appear on the Miirato tsantsa 

 of Colini,^ which apjjarently was in process of preparation when 

 collected. The lip decoration of pendant cords attains a length of

30 centimeters. It is composed of three two-strand cords in the 

 natural color, which, doubled in the middle, is passed downward 

 through one of the piercings, whereupon its projecting loop is traversed 

 by the free ends after crossing the lips. This is the simplest form of 

 loop knot. The three cords form individual entities at the lips, 

 and, unlike the labial ornaments figured by Dr. Rivet,^ there are no 

 connecting loops with pendant cords. Twenty-one and a half 

 centimetres below the lips, one of the ends of the left-hand cord has 

 been broken off. All the remaining strands are gathered together 

 at a point 30 cm. belo\\- the lips and, treated as a single strand, tied 

 in a simple knot. Below this they resume their individuality. 

 Both ends of the central cord and the remaining end of that on the 

 left are formed into a kind of uncut tassel by turning Ijack the ends 

 and tying them in a single knot. The other three cord-ends were 

 possibly united by a similar knot, though at present one of the 

 strands is looped back and knotted upon itself. These cords are 

 generally believed to be more than mere decoration, having a mne- 

 monic value, after the manner of the Peruvian quipu (fig. 1).

Castner tsantsa. 



The chin is rounded and slightly receding, though the latter 

 appearance is considerably enhanced by the artificial protraction of 

 the lips. Two incisions have been made in it — one on the left side 

 extending almost vertically downward arid following the curve from 

 the edge of the lower lip to a point corresponding to the gnathion 

 or slightlj' posterior to it, the other extending forward from the 

 severed edge of the neck to a point below the right angle of the 

 mouth, where the gash turns upward.. These cuts were doubtless 

 made to facilitate the extraction of the lower maxillary bone and 

 were then sewed up with twisted fibre. In the lower seam, the 

 stitches remain in place, but those of the downward incision, with

 graphique, L'Anthropologie, t. XIX, p. 79.

the exception of a single stitch, have evidently been cut away from 

 the surface, leaving two parallel rows of stub ends of fibre visible on 

 the opposite sides of the crack. 



The ears, though reduced to a length of 3 cm., are apparently in 

 nowise distorted. The lobule of each is pierced with a round hole, 

 through which passes the soft cord of two twisted strands, which ties 

 on the pendant ear ornament. These are of unequal length, that of 

 the right ear being only 22 cm., while the left one measures 42 cm. 

 from its fibre proximal end to the tip of the hair tuft in which it 

 terminates. These cylindrical ear ornaments are formed of a heavy 

 rope of twisted fibre, coarser and more woody than the cords througli 

 the ears and lips, and tightly bound with fibre at both ends. To the 

 distal end has been attached, partly by gumming and partly by 

 fibre wrapping, first a heavy tuft of hair, apparently human, 10 cm. 

 long on the longer, and 5 cm. on the shorter pendant. Above this, 

 with more gum and more encircling strands, was laid a circle of 

 small yellowish-green feathers, 4 cm. long. Al:)ovc th(!se come the 

 overlapping, iridescent scales which have entirely covereil tiu; 

 foundation and consist of the green elytra of a troj^ic beetle, 

 MaUaspis antennatus, each sewed by a single horizontal stitch of 

 very fine twisted fibre, passing through the two perforations in its 

 proximal end. Occasionally there is t)ut one perforation, but even 

 in that case the stitch is usually horizontal, jiassing over the opposite 

 edge.'' 



The head has been severed at. a point level with the lower line of 

 the chin. The orifice has an oval fonn, being compressed laterally, 

 in conformity with the whole head. At the section, the thickness 

 of the flesh varies from 3 mm. to 9 mm. 



By ordinary day light, the hair is of an ebony-black, but in sun 

 light shows considerable iridescence with a marked reddish cast 

 in the shorter hair of the fore part of the head. In character, it is 

 moderately fine, wavy, and rather stiff. Much of it, upon the top and 

 sides of the head, is short; the longest at the back reaches a length 

 of 40 cm. Probably much has been removed for the scalp-belt — 

 a trophy the Jibaro esteems only second to the tsantsa. 



The scalp is seamed from what was, before distorting in desiccation, 

 the posterior median line of the neck to a point midway to the 

 vertex. 



At the crown of the head, there is a single circular perforation, 



* Dr. Colini {opera cilii, lav. II, figs. 10 and 10 bis) figures car pendants of this 

 type and siscribes them to the Muratos, a division of the Jiburos.

through which passes the doubled suspension cord. The free ends 

 of this cord are knotted within the head around a small stick laid 

 in anterior-posterior position beneath the vertex. Some 8 cm. 

 above the point of issuance, the doubled cord is drawn into an incom- 

 plete knot, i.e., the end is not pulled through, but doubled back upon 

 itself. A centimeter farther and the doubled cord is again knotted. 

 From this point it continues without further interruption, 335 mm., 

 the loop thus formed of 671 mm. being of sufficient size to permit 

 of passage over the head of the former Jibaro omier, when the 

 tsantsa was worn suspended around the neck. 



This suspension cord is not twisted, but woven, or rather plaited, 

 with a fairly uniform width of 4 mm. The cut end within the head 

 shows ten strands, and the techniciue' is uncjuestionably that of the 

 five-loop plaiting described l\v Dr. Roth.^ It possesses the attractive 

 arrangement of strands and the flat under-surface, with slightly 

 convex upper face characteristic of this peculiar process, and a series 

 of experiments in ten-strand cord plaiting failed to reproduce it 

 exactly, until the Warrau five-loop plaiting was tried. The result 

 was more than satisfactory, for rather rapid Work with this method 

 gave all the peculiarities seen in the Jibaro cord — the occasional 

 overlapping of one of the strands of the loop by its mate, thus con- 

 cealing the lower, the consequent thickening and narrowing of the 

 cord with the obscuring of the pattern — points which do not appear 

 in Dr. Roth 's beautifully regular drawing. It is of interest to note 

 the occurrence of this technique — which would seem to be unre- 

 corded elsewhere — in two such widely separated localities as the 

 Amazonian slopes of the Andes in Ecuador and the Pomeroon Dis- 

 trict of British Guiana; employed, in the one case, by the Jibaros, 

 a tribal group of as yet undetermined affinities,* and, in the other, 

 by the Warraus, whose relationships also remain to be fixed; and 

 the question arises as to whether this five-loop plait is made also by 

 the people of the far-flung Carib stock. 



While engaged in the study of the Academy's tsantsa, another of 

 these little mummified heads came under the writer's notice, and 

 it was deemed advisable to include a brief description of it (Plate 



' Dr. Walter E. Roth, Some Technological Xotes from the Pomeroon District, 

 British Guiana. Journal of the R. Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and 

 Ireland, vol. XL, p. 27, Plate VI. figs. 1-5. 



' Dr. Rivet, Journ. citu, t. XVIII, p. 338, footnote, promises a detailed study 

 of the langiiage of the Jibaros, based on vocabularies in his possession. Pre- 

 viously available evidence of its affinities was not sufficient to permit of assigning 

 the tribal group to any stock.

VII, a and b). This trophy is owaied by Mr. Samuel Castner, Jr., 

 of Phihidelphia, and was obtained l)y him in 1903 at a sale of the 

 collection of Arthur H. Little, where it was wronglj' ascribed to 

 Oceanica. It is a typical .Jibaro tsantsa, in excellent condition. 



The skin is' of the same chocolate-brown color, but without the 

 lighter tones which distinguish the proniinences in the one already 

 described. It is smooth and shows no traces of tattooing. 



The measurements follow: 



m. 



Horizontal circumference 200 



Transverse supra-auricular curve ...- 160 



Maximum antero-post. diameter (inion-glabella) 087 



Maximimi occipito-labial diameter .105 



Maximum transverse diameter. 060 



Total length of face : 075 



Maximum bi-zygomatic diameter .045 



Comparing the two specimens, it is evitlent that the gain in both 

 the horizontal circumference and in the transverse supra-auricular 

 curve, of the Castner piece, is due to the greater width of the head, 

 both the longitudinal diameters being actually shorter. The face 

 also is broader and shorter, with very slight prognathism. 



The head is not noticeably asymmetrical and possesses the char- 

 acteristic tleep depressions behind the temjiles. The checks are 

 rounded out, so that the muscles of the mouth and the position of 

 the zygomatic arch are not brought into relief. 



The eyebrows are symmetrical anil fairly heavy, with individual 

 hairs reaching a length of 10 mm. No eyelashes are visible, the 

 eyelids being inverted but not stitchetl. 



There is no break across the root of the nose, l)ut a deep crease, 

 due to the protraction of the bucco-na.sal region. The nasal contour 

 is marked by a moderate curve from tip to root. The nostrils are 

 directed horizontally forward and show numerous vibrLssae. Neither 

 septum nor allie have been perforated. 



The lips, whicii are projjortionatcly heavy, show three vertical 

 piercings, each occupied by a short twisted cord which traverses 

 both lips and is knotted in front, leaving short pendant ends. To 

 these cords, just aiiove the point of issuance from the perforation 

 in the lower lip, a horizontal cord is attached, which, in turn, bears 

 the characteristic liii decoration of long, jiendant cords — twenty-two 

 in number and se]>aratc(l into two groups liy the knotting of the 

 horizontal sustainer around the central vertical cord. The long 

 twisted cords of both groups fall straight to a length of m. .367 (fig. 2). 




191-1.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 203 



The chin is rounded, but not receding; it falls into a vertical line 

 with the lower forehead. No incisions are visible, only a deep 

 furrow from the neck to behind the position of the maxilla on the 

 left side. In this, as in other details, the Castner tsantsa shows the 

 work of a more skilful preparator than was the Jibaro from whose 

 hand the Academy's specimen came. 



The ears are considerably distorted so that an- accurate measure- 

 ment is not possible. Both have been pierced through the lobule, 

 though the right one alone bears an ornament — a section af bird (?) 

 bone, hung by a doubled cord of twisted fibre drawrj. through it, 

 the knotted loop end being pulled back within the hollow bone. 



The head has been severed by a diagonal cut, which passed close 

 to the head on the right, but left a portion of the neck on the left 

 side. The flesh at the section varies from 4 to 2 mm. in thickness. 



The hair is of a beautiful ebony-black, fine and wav.y, and reaches 

 a length of 56 cm. The seaming of the scalp extends from the neck 

 in the posterior median line almost to the vertex, where the single 

 perforation occurs through which the suspension cord is passed. 

 This latter has a length of only .50 cm. from the point of issuance 

 from the perforation to its re-entry therein. The width of the cord 

 is 3 mm., and the technique is evidently the same five-loop plaiting 

 noted in the suspension cord of the Academy's tsantsa. 



Comparison with the table of measurements of the eleven mum- 

 mied heads studied by Dr. Rivet,^ shows that in both the tsantsas 

 here described the horizontal circumference, the transverse supra- 

 auricular curve, and the maximum antero-posterior diameter rise 

 above the average, thougli not reaching the maximum measurements. 

 In maximum transverse diameter, the Academy's piece falls within 

 3 mm. of the minimum, while the Castner head is above the average; 

 in total height of face, the Academy's approaches the maximum, 

 with a bi-zygomatic diameter below the minimum,^ while the height 

 of the Castner specimen is below the minimum and its width at the 

 zygoma somewhat below the mean. 



Reference should be made to the preparation of these trophy 

 heads, because of its relation to the structure and condition of the 

 finished product. Three methods have been described by reliable 

 travellers, and it is probable that all are, in the main, correct, the 

 differences being due to local variation of practice among the Jibaro 

 tribes.

Dr. Rivet,' following Lubbock and other writers, gives the fol- 

 lowing i^rocedure. After the extraction of the cranium through 

 Ihe posterior incision, the skin with adherent flesh is boiled in an 

 herb decoction. Withdrawii from this, it is placed around a spherical 

 stone, superheated, and, after shrinkage, upon a smaller stone, and 

 then ui)on a third yet smaller. Meanwhile, another hot stone is 

 passed back and forth over the surface, thus facilitating the shrinking 

 and drying of the tissue. The lips, and sometimes the eyelids also, 

 had previously been carefully sewed to prevent the retraction in 

 desiccation, causing them to gape. 



According to the engineer Von Hassel,^ after the substitution of 

 the hot .stone for the cranium, the head is hung in the smoke of a 

 palm-root fire, but there is no mention of boiling. The lips are 

 "deformed — by means of a cord and a little piece of chonta" (wood). 



The third description of the method pursued, which was given 

 Lieui. Safford by Senor Tirado'" — an eye-witne.ss — is an interesting 

 blending of the two preceding. According to this statement, imme- 

 diately after the extraction of the skull, the scalp is sewed up. and the 

 hole in the vertex pierced and supplied with its cord. Afterwards 

 the head is dipped in the hot infusion of herlis, "care being taken 

 not to allow the roots of the hair to enter," though how this latter 

 precaution is possible is not readily conceivable. Dried by the 

 introduction of hot stones, it is then smoked over the cooking-tire, 

 the hair Ix'ing wrapped in leaves for jirotection. After three or 

 four months of curing in the smoke, the lips are pierced and the 

 decorations added. 



None of these descriptions makes mention of any lashing or means 

 of holding the cranial envelope in position during the curing process. 

 Yet the Murato tsantsa of Colini," which is evidently a head obtained 

 before the finishing touches had been added, shows a slender spike 

 of wood passed backward through the nostrils and out through the 

 perforation at the vertex. A cord is la-jhed around the ends of this 

 stick and over llu- forehead, thus forcing the ii^i-^trils forwMnI ;iiid

upward, and causing the deep bend at the root of the nose, which is 

 characteristic of all genuine tsantsas, and, in the Academy's example, 

 has resulted in an actual breaking of the integument. 



The three piercings of the lips are also occupied by skewers lashed 

 in place; another stick is thrust into the auditory meatus and the 

 neck is secured to a wooden ring by stitching. 



The lips, then, in this unfinished trophy, are already pierced and 

 held together by skewers, which fix them rigidly in the desired 

 position. Together with the spike through nostril and vertex, they 

 form an essential part of the taxidermy and account for the char- 

 acteristic protraction of the lips. Certainly in both specimens 

 herein described, the perforations of the lips, like those of the lobules, 

 were accomplished while the flesh was comparatively soft. On the 

 other hand, the stick thrust into the auditory meatus would seem not 

 to have been a constant feature of the preparation, as the small hole 

 made by it is found only occasionally. 



Some sort of device must have been in use for keeping open 

 during desiccation the flaccid skin of the neck, and the wooden 

 circle of Colini's tsantsa would have admirably served this purpose. 

 The Academy's specimen shows at the section of the neck certain 

 fine grooves, running from the outer to the inner surface of the 

 fiesh, as if it had been traversed by stitches and had later been cut 

 or broken away along the plane of the piercings, leaving the grooves 

 exposed. 



It seems to be certain that, whether the preparation occupied one 

 day, one week, or several months, whether it was by means of alter- 

 nate steaming and drying or by smoking, or by a combination of 

 both methods — as seems probable — the seaming of the scalp, the 

 piercing of the vertex and of the lips, and the insertion of the wand 

 from nostril to vertex must liave l^een done while the fiesh had not 

 yet hardened; but, apparently, wlien the last of these operations 

 took place, the trophy was already reduced practically to its final 

 dimensions and, in the case of the Academy's tsantsa, had lost some 

 of its flexibility.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW ECHINODEEM. 

 BY HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



Several j'ears ago the Academy received from Mr. Clarence 

 Bloomfield Moore specimens of a fossil sea-urchin, which had been 

 olstained from material dredged from near the mouth of tiie Withla- 

 coochee River, Florida, in an area mapped as Pliocene. The speci- 

 mens represent an undescribed species, which may be called — 

 EupatagTis mooreanU8 n. sp. Plate VIII. 



The outline is broadly ovate, slightly emarginate in front, tajn'ring 

 a little, and abruptly, vertically truncate behind. The upper surface 

 is moderately convex, highest at the posterior third of the length: 

 lower surface nearly flat, slightly concave at the sides and anteriorly 

 close to the peristome, 



The ainbulacral centre is at the anterior six-tenths of the length- 

 Unpaired aml)ulacral area indistinct, without large pores. Paired 

 ambulacral areas petaloid, nearly straight-sided, closed at the distal 

 ends. Those of the posterior pair are a little longer than the anterior. 

 They form an acute angle witii one anotiier and right angles with 

 the areas of tiie anterior pair. ' The poriferous zones are depressed, 

 with (Hiual, circular pores in pairs connected by furrows. The four 

 genital i)ores are equal, round, the anterior \rd\r much closer than the 

 posterior pair. The peripetalous fascicle is distinct, not sinuous. 

 The tul)ercles in the interambulacral areas are very une(iual. The 

 larger ones stand in about five waved concentric series and occupy 

 slight depressions. The posterior interambulacral area is convex 

 and not distinctly tulierculate, having a quite distinct median suture. 



The peristome is in form of a transverse oval, flattened ijosteriorly. 

 It is situated at the anterior third of the length. The periproct 

 ojjens at the summit of the flattened posterior area, is shortly oval, 

 somewhat higher than wide, and a little angular at the ends. The 

 base is closely and strongly tuberculate, the tubercles becoming 

 much smaller at the jieriphery. There is a smooth raised segment 

 from the peristome to the posterior end. 



Length 61, transverse diameter 51, alt. 29 nun. 



This species is about the size of E. devei Cotteau, from which it

differs by the narrower ambulacral petals, the vertically truncate 

 posterior end, wider peristome, equal genital pores, and the different 

 arrangement of the tubercles.

FKESH-WATER MOLLUSKS OF THE OLIGOCENE OF ANTIGUA. 

 BY AMOS P. BROWN AND HENRY A. PILSBRY. 



In a recent paper by one of us' reference has been made to the 

 deposits carrying these fresh-water shells, which were first noted by 

 Nugent.- His collection of Antigua fossils, including, no doubt, speci- 

 mens of these fresh-water moUusks, is still preserved in the collections 

 of the Geological Society of London, now in the British Museum. 

 These deposits were later described by Purves' as his division E, 

 under the name of the "Lacustrine or fresh-water chert." These 

 beds are mapped by Purves as extending completsly across the 

 island, in the central plain from Corbizon Point and Dry Hill in the 

 northwest to near Willoughby Bay and Falmouth Harbor in the 

 southeast. His observations on the fossils appear to have been 

 made at Dry Hill and at Corbizon Point. M. Purves records the 

 following geijera as occurring in these cherts: Melania, Zonites, 

 Nematura or Amnicola, Planorbis, Melampus, Neritina, Truncatdla, 

 Pomatias. He also states that the specific descriptions of these 

 shells will be published later, but this seems never to have been done. 



The species described in this paper were collected from the sea 

 cliffs at Dry Hill, where these flinty beds, carrying fresh-water species, 

 outcrop on the seashore and where they have weathered out by the 

 action of the rains and the salt water dissolving away the calcareous 

 material and leaving the silicified shells intact in a remarkably good 

 state of preservation. When these beds were seen inland at several 

 points, the weathered surfaces of the layers exposing the shells were 

 not so well preserved as at Dry Hill or at Corbizon Point, only 

 sections being found in most cases, as the shells were imbedded in 

 the compact flint. This was, of course, the case at the two localities 

 above noted, likewise; the hard, compact flint layers, varying in 

 thickness from one to four inches, being frequently crowded with 

 these fresh-water shells that showed only in sections' upon the frac-

tured surfaces. Where the sea had been eating into the cliff, and 

 detaching slabs of the hard, flinty layers, the surfaces of these flint 

 slabs were completely covered with the flint pseudomorphs of the 

 shells, these in most cases having the finest sculpture perfectly 

 preserved The relation of these beds to the other members of 

 Brown's division 3 as given in his Notes on the Geology of the Island of 

 Antigua is shown in the section of the rocks at Dry Hill, on page 595,* 

 and there it will be seen that the lacustrine or fresh-water chert layers 

 immediately overlie the Volcanic Sands which form the lower 

 23+ feet of the section. The same sequence of deposits is also 

 seen at Corbizon Point, where the fresh-water chert layers with silicified 

 wood occur along the shore immediately above these same Volcanic 

 Sands that are found at Dry Hill. Near the Botanic Station, just 

 east of St. John's, the flinty layers with fresh-water shells are found, 

 but the shells are imbedded in the flint and only show in sections 

 in the hard, compact rock. The reddish beds of the Volcanic Sands 

 are ab.sent at this locality east of the Botanic Station or are only 

 represented by sandy nodules in the white tuffs. No silicified wood 

 was seen at this place. 



The species described below belong to the genera Heniisinus, 

 Bythinella, and Planorbis. The genus Hemisinus is undoubtedly 

 what Purves has called Melanin and indeed he mentions Hemisinus 

 as being found living in Cuba. These species of Hemisinus are 

 described below. The Bythinella is probably what Purvcs referred 

 to Nematura or Amnicola; we-have described one species. The one 

 Planorbis which we describe is the only representative of this genus 

 in the collection. We found no representatives of Melampus, Trun- 

 catella, Fomatias, Zonites, and Neritina, mentioned b\- Purve-.

 with many rounded ribs, as wide as their intervals, somewhat curved, 

 th? concavity forward an 1 sjinewhat protractive. There are about 

 25 ribs on a whorl. Above the lower suture of each whorl there are 

 two or thre? spiral cjrd;, the lower one strongest. On the last whorl

 to be somewhat effuse at the base of the columella. 



Length 16.5, diam. 6 mm., 8 whorls remaining. 

 " 19.5, " 6.4 " 8 " 



The sculpture of longitudinal ribs with basal spirals is charac- 

 teristic. The same type of sculpture occurs in various South Ameri- 

 can species of Hemisinus. It could readily be matched also in 

 Melanin and related forms or in the Pleuroceratidae. 



There seems to be variation in the development of the spirals. 

 Many specimens show weak traces of impressed spirals over the 

 ribs throughout, and this seems to be the normal condition; but in 

 some examples the ribs appear to be smooth except near their lower 

 ends. 



This species, like the associated forms, has the basal sinus or 

 notch obsolete, as in part of the recent species. 

 Hemisinus siliceus n. sp. Pl. IX, fig. 2. 



The shell is Melaniiform, regularly tapering, the diameter of last 

 whorl containefl about 2\ times in the total length. The whorls 

 are convex, and apparently without any sculpture except growth- 

 lines. The last whorl has fine, reversed sigmoid growth stria;, which 

 retract soipewhat below the suture, then advance, as in H. cuhaniana. 

 In the type specimen a former peristome, indicating a period of 

 growth arrest, appears as a sigmoid varix on the last whorl. This 

 indicates a more strongly sigmoid outer lip than in the recent Antil- 

 lean species. 



Length 26 mm., about 6 whorls remaining, the summit lost; diam 

 10.8 mm. 



No entirely perfect aperture was found on the slabs collected, 

 but so far as we can judge, it seems to be much like that of Hemisinus 

 cubanianus (Orb.). It is not unlikely that H. siliceus is ancestral, 

 or at least a collateral species not far removed from the ancestral 

 stock of the smooth Antillean species of Hemisinus. 



There is, of course, a possilnlity that this Antigua species belongs 

 to the genus Pachycheilus, which is represented in the recent fauna 

 of Cuba by P. conicus (Orb.) and P. violaceus Prest.; but the 

 straighter columella does not, in our opinion, favor this view. 



The type has lost the shell from the spire by conversion into flint, 

 but the surface has been preserved in perfection on.the last whorl. 



Hemisinus latus n. sp. Pl. IX. fig. 4. 



This form is represented by somewhat numerous internal casts, 

 of which the largest has been selected for illustration. It differs 




212 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



from the associated species by its decidedly broader figure. The 

 diameter of last whorl is contained about 2| times in the estimated 

 total length. The whorls, of which somewhat over 5 are preserved 

 in the type, are shorter and broader than in H. siliceus. Very little 

 of the shell is preserved and the sculpture is unkno\\ni. It is proba- 

 bly smooth. The aperture is largely concealed by another shell, 

 the thin, arcuate, outer lip alone remaining visible.

The shell is olilong, pupiform, smooth; outlines of the spire 

 convex, the apex conspicuously obtuse. Whorls 4, very convex, 

 aperture vertical, shortly ovate, its length contained 2^ 

 times in that of the shell; peristome in one plane, thin. 

 Length 1.8, diam. 1.1, length of ajierture 0.7 mm. 

 This very minute form is not rare. It has the very 

 obtuse smnmit and the pupiform shape of the species 

 usually referred to Bythinella, rather than the shape 

 of Pahtdestrina, if, indeed, the two groups are distinct. 

 Of course, any generic reference of a minute fossil 

 Amnicoloid shell of this sort is purely provisional, unless it is from 

 a region where the recent fauna and its antecedents are well known.

This is a species of the section Tropicorbis.^ The shell is rather

 The last whorl is rounded on this side. On the left side the la.st 

 whorl is subangular and the cavity is less infumlibuliform.

The species of Hemisinus, ais of related genera, arc river snails. 

 They do not inhabit intennittent streams, ponds, or lakes, except as 

 the latter nuiy form part of a stream system; and they are equally 

 unknown in brackish water. The occurrence of several well-differen- 

 tiated species therefore implies the presence of rivers or permanent

streams. Melanians are not likely to be distributed by adventitious 

 means from stream to stream, as Physa, Anodonta, and some other 

 fresh-water moUusks are. Their egg capsules are not gelatinous or 

 likely to adhere to the feet of water fowl, but are firmly fixed to 

 stones, shells, or the like. Wherever their distribution has been 

 studied in detail, it has been found remarkably consistent and 

 explicable by actual stream connections or such as have probably 

 existed within the life of the species or group in question. As the 

 relationships of the Antiguan species are with South America {H. 

 antiguensis) and with Cuba {H. siliceus), it seems probable that (1) 

 at the stage of the Oligocene when this bed was formed, a consider- 

 able land surface existed in the Antiguan area, and (2) that this area 

 was, or had been, connected with the South American main. 



It seems likely that the present Hemisinus species of Cuba and 

 Jamaica are descendants of the same South American stock. There 

 is in Cuba, however, another totally distinct genus of Melanians, 

 Pachycheilus, represented by P. nigrata (Poey) and P. violaceus 

 Prest. of the recent fauna, which are apparently traceable to a 

 Central American coimection. 



The other fresh-water snails of the silex bed are not significant. 

 The Planorbis belongs to a group widely spread in the recent Neotropi- 

 cal fauna and the " Bythinella" is an ambiguous form of unknown 

 relationships.^

TWO NEW SARCOSPOBIDIA. 



BY HOWARD CRAWLEY. 



Sarcooystis leporum sp. n. 



The material on which the present study is based consists of the 

 arm and shoulder of a very old male rabbit shot at Bowie, Md., 

 on December 13, 1913. The presence of Sarcosporidia in rabbits has 

 been recorded from time to time in the literature, and there are four 

 specimens of this parasite in the collection of the Zoological Division 

 of the Bureau of Animal Industry, the localities of which were 

 Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois. No descrip- 

 tion of the organism has ever been published, nor has it received a 

 name. With regard to this latter point certain authors have of late 

 assumed that the Sarcosporidia, like other parasites, are in the case 

 of each species capable of dwelling in any one of several hosts, and 

 there is a certain amount of experimental evidence that this is true. 

 Nevertheless, in the event of a duplication of names, it is very easy 

 to relegate one of them to synonymy, whereas it is extremely awkward 

 to be obliged to refer to a parasite as the sarcosporidian found by a 

 certain author in a certain animal from a certain hn-ality on a ('ortain 

 date. Hence it seems best to make a new species, and I propose 

 to call this parasite Sarcocijfitis leporum'. 



In the fresh tissue the parasitic cysts were visible as short, delicate 

 threads or rods lying in the muscles. They were about two milli- 

 meters long, and the diameter measured in j)arafiin sections was 

 from 200 to 250 microns. It may incidentally be mentioned, how- 

 ever, that the size of a sarcosporidian cyst is of no diagnostic value, 

 since it is wholly a function of the age, and the cysts of this j)articular 

 specimen were probably much under the possible maximum size. 



Compared with the infestations seen in rats, mice, and ducks, that 

 of the rabbit here under con-;ideration was verj' slight, and a casual 

 glance at the flesh would j)robably not have revealed anything amiss. 

 Data as to how heavily rabbits may become infested arc, however, 

 wholly lacking. 



The cysts, in paraffin sections, showed nothing noteworthy. The 

 cyst wall was from 5 to G microns thick, and seen under low powers 

 presented the typical striated appearance. Under high magnifica- 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 215 



tion, however (500 to 1000), it was easy to see that the wall was 

 composed of a great number of papilliform processes, standing closely 

 packed together upon a sort of basement membrane and with their 

 outer ends wholly free. That is, the cyst wall, at least in this case, 

 does not consist of a memlirane pierced by pores, nor of a congeries 

 of rods bounded both without and within by a membrane, but of 

 rods or papilliB projecting freely from a basement membrane. 

 Furthermore, in this case, there was nothing to show that any part 

 of the cyst wall was derived from the surrounding host tissue. 



As already stated, the papillae rested upon a basement membrane 

 with which they were apparently continuous. Within there was 

 to be seen the structure usual for sarcosporidian cysts; that is, a 

 division of the central space into compartments, the walls of which 

 were a continuation of the membrane inclosing the cyst. Finally, 

 in the central portions of the cysts there was a small area free of 

 spores, and here the coarsely alveolar structure of the frame work 

 could readily be seen. This is in itself an indication that these cysts 

 were young rather than old, since it is a matter of common obser- 

 vation that in old cysts there is always present a central space of 

 considcral)le extent in which there are no spores. 



As is usual, the cysts were closely packed with spores which 

 showed a certain disposition to be arranged in files, radiating from 

 the centre to the periphery. 



A study of the spores themselves revealed data of considerably 

 greater interest. Several mounts were prepared by smearing out the 

 contents of the cysts on slides, drying, fixing in absolute alcohol and 

 staining in Giemsa. As thus prepared, the spores measured about 

 13/'- long by 5/^ wide, the precise figures for the average of 20 specimens 

 measured being 13.14,'^- long by 5.16/^ broad. The longest spore 

 measured was 16,'>. long, the broadest 6," wide. The figure given for 

 the length, however, is a trifle too small, since the measurement was 

 tsricen in a straight line, no allowance being made for the curvature. 

 Furthermore, it is not unlikely that the fixed spores are too wide, 

 since they are quite large enough to be flattened in the process of 

 fixation. 



The spores, although possessing the typical banana shape, are not 

 cjuite symmetrical, it being generally possible to distinguish between 

 a narrower, more pointed anfl a broader, more rounded end. This 

 narrower end, which may be regarded as anterior, is occupied by a 

 very solid mass of homogeneous cytoplasm, which has but little 

 affinity for the stain and contrasts very sharply with the deeply 




216 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



staining cytoplasm of tlie remainder of the spore. Thus, when 

 viewed with powers of only 200 to 300, the spores show two very 

 clear-cut oval areas, the nucleus in the posterior half and the differ- 

 entiated area in front, and this latter is sometimes so faintly stained 

 that the complete outline of the spore cannot be followed. 



The clear region is sometimes oval, sometimes truncated behind, 

 as shown in the figure. It may be spoken of as the rostrum of the 

 spore. Behind it, the cytoplasm abruptly assumes the character 

 which it possesses in the remaining portion of the spore where it is 

 densely staining and conspicuously alveolar. It. is to be noted, how- 



Spores ot Sarcocystisleporum. X 3.500. 



ever, that the cytoplasm nearest the rostrum shows the coarsest 

 alveoli, while backward the alveoli become smaller and smaller, so 

 that in many cases the cytoplasm in the posterior half of the spore 

 becomes very dense, on account of the excessive minuteness of the 

 alveoli. In other cases, however, the alveoli are distinctly visible 

 throughout the entire extent of the dense spongiojjla-im of the cell. 

 At times, also, the spongioplasm encroaches .somewhat upon the 

 homogeneous cytoplasm of the rostrum, there being here visible 

 one or more alveoli or one or more strands of spongioplasm. There 

 is, finally, often to be seen one or two clearer regions in the cj'toplasm 

 between the rostrum and nucleus, but it is not believed that these 

 represent morphological entities. 



Following the rule for the spores of Sarcosporidia, there is no mem- 

 brane, the spores l)eing naked ma^sses of protoplasm. 



The nucleus may occupy nearly any position in the cell, but it is 

 usually placed near the posterior end. Although, as already stated, 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 217 



it stands out very clearly when the spores are viewed with rather 

 low powers, it seems for the most part to be no more than a clear 

 space in the cytoplasm, and it is only occasionally that a definitive 

 nuclear membrane can be demonstrated. Within it is normally 

 provided with a number of chromatin granules. These granules 

 vary a good deal in size. At times they are quite minute and occur 

 in clusters and chains. More frequently, however, they are quite 

 large, round, or elongated, and appear to be wholly free in the nuclear 

 sap. At times, also, there is a more or less typical chrjnatin net. 

 Whereas these differences may have some significance, it is perhaps 

 best to regard them merely as variants of some fundamental plan. 



The spores of certain species of the Sarcosporidia which attack 

 mammals are described and figured as being liberally provided with 

 rather densely staining granules, concerning which there has been a 

 good deal of theoretical discussion. Frequently, also, such spores 

 have been described as showing a differentiated area at one end, and 

 attempts have been made to correlate this area with the polar cap- 

 sules of the spores of the Myxosporidia. In the case in hand, the 

 spores of Sarcocystis leporum, there is at least no question about the 

 structure, which is remarkably clear cut and perfectly obvious. 

 And the rostrum of this spore, whatever may be its homologies, is 

 clearly the analogue of the rostra of the sporozoites and merozoites 

 of Coccidia. Moreover, it seems an entirely safe assumption 

 that its function is to enable the spore to drill its way into the intes- 

 tinal epithelium of its host, without prejudice as to whether this 

 host be an invertebrate, another rabbit, or some carnivorous mammal 

 or bird which preys upon the rabbit. 

 Sarcocystis setophagse sp. n. 



Stiles (1895c)' notes that Dr. Hassall, of the Bureau of Animal 

 Industry, discovered a sarcosporidian in the muscles of a redstart 

 {Setophaga ruticilla), and a description of this parasite was promised 

 at the time. This description, however, was never published, and the 

 material, consisting of two cysts embedded in paraffin, was recently 

 given to me by Dr. Hassall. 



Based upon the number of sections yielded by the cysts, their 

 length was about 2.5 mm., while the largest cross sections measured 

 about 1 mm. in diameter. Hence the cysts are thick in proportion 

 to their length, which seems characteristic for Sarcosporidia of birds. 

 The cysts were divided into the usual compartments.

218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



Unfortunately, the material was not in good condition forcytological 

 study, and very little could be mads out as to the structure of the 

 spores. As well, however, as could be determined, the form was 

 that shown by the spore of Sarcocystis rileyi, that is, one end was 

 rounded, the other pointed. The spores were sometimes straight, 

 sometimes curved, but in the latter case the curvature was .slight, 

 which also seems characteristic for avian Sarcosporidia. AVithin, 

 in a few of the better preserved specimens, it was possible to make 

 out a vacuole in which was a chromatin granule. This structure is 

 probably to be interpreted as a vesicular nucleus. 



The spores were small, measuring from 4 to 5 microns long by 

 .75 to 1.00 micron broad.

A NEW DIATOM. 



BY CHARLES S. BOYER, A.M. 



Chaetoceros elmorei n. sp. Plate X. 



Prof. C. J. Elmore, of Grand Island College, Nebraska, sent me 

 recently a slide containing a form of Chcetoceros. On first examina- 

 tion, the species appeared to resemble C. imghaniii Br. On receipt, 

 however, of material which was sulijected to a closer examination, 

 I have concluded that the species is new. The material had been 

 dried upon blotting paper and it was necessary to soak it for a long 

 while to secure filaments of- the proper size, it being impossible, of 

 course, to resort to the proper methods of cleaning. The character 

 of the chromatophores is not known. I have, however, succeeded in 

 mounting a number of slides which show quite clearly the structure 

 of the valves and spores. 



All species of the genus Chcetoceros have heretofore been considered 

 as marine, and have not been fouml inland except in the Caspian 

 Sea. The species about to be described is found in Devils Lake, 

 North Dakota. 



It may be of interest to give a brief description of the locality 

 from the Second and the Sixth Biennial Reports of the State Geological 

 Survey of Xorfh Dakota, of the years 190.3 and 1912, respectively. 

 In the Report for 1903, from an article bj- Air. E. J. Babcock, Water 

 Resources of the Devils Lake Region (p. 208), and also from an article 

 by Mr. Howard E. Simpson, The Physiography of the Devils-Stump 

 Lake Region, in the Report for 1912 (p. 105), the following information 

 is obtained: 



Devils Lake is in Lat. 48° N., Long. 99° W. It is a glacial lake and 

 "occupies a basin formed largely by morainic ridges." Its length 

 is "about twenty-four miles, and the width averages, perhaps, 

 between four and seven miles." It lies at an elevation of about 

 fourteen hundred feet, and its greatest depth is not more than 

 twenty-nine feet. No streams of any size enter the lake, its chief 

 source of supply being the annual rainfall from the surrounding 

 ridges, and it has no outlet. Although originally a large fresh- 

 water lake, it is now much reduced in size, and its waters "may be 

 termed alkaline and brackish, since they show a salinity of about 




220 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Mar., 



one per cent., of which magnesium and sodium salts constitute a 

 considerable portion." 



The following is the diagnosis of the form: 



Filaments straight, 2Z!i wide. 



Cells rectangular with sharp angles; valves slightly convex; 

 foramina narrowly line.ar, irregular, bipartite. 



Setae straight, hollow, approaching each other at an acute angle 

 and crossing at a right angle near the corners of the valves, about 

 ten times the length of the valve. In valve view they diverge from 

 each other at an angle of about 80°. 



Terminal seta; shorter than the others, somewhat curved in the 

 direction of the filament. 



Spores with the primary valve arcuat3, secondan,' valve produced 

 into a subconical frustum. Rarely in free spores the primary valve 

 is covered with minute spines. 



The valves are joined together near one side by a tubular com- 

 missure, from six-tenths to eight-tenths of a micron in thickness, 

 situated near the edge of the valve, usually at unequal distances 

 from each end, and, so far as noticed, is found near the margin on 

 the same side of all valves in the filament. 



The presence of the connecting tube and the unusual locality 

 combine to render this form a unique species, which I take pleasure 

 in naming after Prof. Elmore. 



An examination of fig. II, i and k, in Plate III, in Schutt's article 

 (Ueber die DiatotneengaUung Vhcetoceros, Bot. Zeitung, 1888) offers 

 an interesting suggestion as to the origin of the commissure. In 

 the genus Thalassiosira the cells are connected by mucilaginous 

 threads which are central. In the present species of Chcetoceros the 

 commissure is eccentric and appears to be tubular. In C. simile the 

 valves touch each other, and in several species, such as compadum, 

 the centre of the valve is produced or coasiderably elevated, but 

 in no previously described form has the union of the frustules been 

 consummated, except by the interlacing of the awns. 



The other diatoms sparingly fuund in the waters of the lake include 

 species of Fragilaria, Gomphonema, Epilhemia, and Surirella. Owing 

 to the presence of great quantities of small Crustacea, the material 

 is mounted with difficulty.

Fig. 1- — A short filanicnt con.sistinp of seven cells. The filaments usually contain

Fig. 2 shows the accidental separation of two adjacent cells and the division 

 of the commissure. 



Fig. .3 is a diagrammatic representation of the position of the commissure 

 near one side of the cell. The valves are frequently in close contact in the 

 middle, making the foramen bipartite. 



Fig. -1. — Represents the usual position of the commissure, although the dis- 

 tance from the edge of the valve is somewhat variable. Sometimes the com- 

 missure is in the middle of the side, but more frequently nearer one end. 



Fig. 5 is a valve view of the secondaiy valve as seen in the cell. 



Fig. 6 shows a form rarely found of a free spore much more developed than 

 the others and having the surface of the primary valve partly covered with 

 spines, somewhat as in C. unghamii Br. Specimens of the latter in my 

 collection, however, show spores which are smaller, more cu-cular, and with 

 the surface more evenly covered with spines.

 with their secondary valves opposed.

 Ernest Comly Dercum, April 10, 1914. 



The Council reported that Messrs. John Cadwalader, Charles B. 

 Penrose, Witmer Stone, and J. Percy Moore had been appointed 

 to constitute the Standing Committee on By-Laws. 



On the unanimous nomination of the Committee on the Hayden 

 Memorial Geological Award, the gold Hayden Memorial Medal 

 was conferred on Hem-y Fairfield Osborn, Sc.D., LL.D., in recog- 

 nition of his distinguished work in vertebrate palaeontology. 



Henry Fairfield Osborn was born at Fairfield, Conn., August 8, 1857. 

 Ho was educated at Princeton College (1877, 1880), Cambridge University 

 under Balfour (1879), and the Royal College of Science under Huxley (1879-80). 

 He has received the following degrees: Princeton A.H. 1877, Sc.D. 1880; 

 Hon. LL.D. Trinity College 1901, Princeton 1902, Columbia 1907; Hon. D.Sc. 

 Cambridge 1904; Hon. Ph.D. Christiania 1911, Upsala 1913. 



Dr. Osborn began his palwontological explorations in Wyoming in 1877, and 

 has continued them to the present time in various parts of the United States, 

 in Europe and Egj'pt. From 1877 to 1890 he was connected with the Princeton 

 University expeditions and the Museimi of Geology, and between 1891 and 1914 

 he has directed the .\merican Museum e.\plorations in vertebTate paleontology. 



His own researches and those of his students fill five volumes of papers from 

 the American Museum Memoir and Bulletin. His publications and papers in 



la 




228 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



vertebrate palffontology embrace 197 titles, including Euoluliou of Mummaluin 

 Molar Teeth, published in 1907, and The Age of Mammals, published in 1910, 

 beside the American Museum volumes above referreil, to. They cover contribu- 

 tions to the history of the e.xtinct fishes, reptiles, and mammals. Dr. Osborn 

 succeeded Edward D. Cope as Vertebrate Palaeontologist of the (ieological 

 Survey of Canada between the years 1900-1904. In 1900 he was appointed 

 succes.sor to Othniol C. Marsh as Vertebrate PaliEontologist of the United States 

 Geological Survey, and is still engaged on the series of pateontological mono- 

 graphs which were left unfinished by Marsh, especially those on the titanolheres 

 and the Sauropoda. 



Among the most important of his investigations are the following: the evolu- 

 tion of the ungulate foot, the evolution of the types of molar teeth of the mam- 

 mals, the evolution of the peri.ssodactyl ungulates, especially the rhinoceroses, 

 horses, and titanotheres, the correlation of the Tertiary geological liorizoix? of 

 Europe and North .\meriea, the principles of the evolution of the .skull in mam- 

 mals, and the laws of evolution as ob.served in paheontology. 



Dr. Csborn's administration of the Department of Vertebrate Paheontology 

 in the .\merican Museum of Natural History has been instrumental in assembling 

 the most extensive collection of vertebrate fo.s.sils in existence, including the 

 complete vertebrate fauna of more than half of the Tertiary horizons of the \\ est 

 and the complete phyletic evolution of matiy of the most important types of 

 mammals. This administration has been notable also ii\ establishing the 

 American Museum as a training school in vertebrate paheontology from which 

 have issued many of the leading vertebrate paUeontologists of the younger 

 generation in this country and abroad. There have been corresponding advances 

 in pateontological technique and the educational methods of pateoiilology, so 

 that the fossil collections in the .\merican Museum have become a standard for 

 the same work in other institutions. 



In addition to these palxontological and geological activities Dr. Osborn ha.s 

 held many educational and administrative ])ositions, including the profe.H.sor.ship 

 of comparative anatomy at Princeton (1XS3-1900) and the profes.sorship of 

 zo(>logy at Columbia University (1891-1914). Since 1890 he ha.s been instru- 

 n)entai in the develoijment of the .\merican Museum of Natural History and 

 the founding and development of the New York Zoological Park. His contribu- 

 tions on the administration of the Museum and the Zoological Park number 

 twenty-six titles. 



His total contributions to science cover a broad field, embracing in the 390 

 titles beside vertebrate palaeontology researches and addresse.s on zoolog}', 

 embryology, neurology, psychology, odontology, zoogeography, geology, biology, 

 a"nlroi)ology, biography, and education.

FISHES FROM THE RUPUNtJNI RIVEK, BRITISH GUIANA. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



In the fall of 1912 the Academy received a collection of fresh- 

 water fishes from the Rupununi River, in the highlands of British 

 Guiana. The specimens were purchased from ^Nlr. J. Ogilvie, 

 who collected them during the same year and in 1911. Mr. Ogilvie 

 informs me, in lieu of the name of any settlement or to\\'n, they were 

 approximately secured in North Latitude 2° to 3°, and West Longi- 

 tude 50° 20'. A number are apparently new or undespribed, while 

 others are not only new records for the Rupunmii, but also for Guiana 

 as well. The figures are all drawii to scale, each number over the 

 accompanying line signifying millimeters. 



SELACHII.

 Potamotrygon hystrix (MuUer and Troschel). 



One young foetal example. Color pale uniform l^rown. . Six pa-

 Osteoglossum bicirrhosum .A.gassiz. Fig. 1 (young). 



One 273 mm. Also three young with yolk-sacs still adherent. 

 According to Mr. Ogilvie, this fish carries its young in its mouth 

 until they wholly absorb the yolk and they are able to fend for 

 themselves.

forai, as I overlooked Oken, though he wrongly identifies' the exam- 

 ples I recorded as Psectrogaster ciliatus within the genus Curityiatus. 

 They are undoubtedly members of the genus Psedrogaster, as their 

 spinescent scales show, and cannot be identified with the diagnosis 

 he gives for the species Curimatus ciliatus, and this after he had 

 examined the type of Anodus ciliatus Miiller and Troschel in Berlin. 

 If this Species is found identical with Curimatus cyprinoides (Lin- 

 njeus), this latter name will, of course, supersede. Contrary to my 

 arrangement in 1906, 1 now believe my Ambj-iacu and Upper Amazon 

 specimens to belong to Psectrogaster amazonicus Eigennaann and 

 Eigenraann. 



Subgenus CYPHOCHARAX Fowler. 



Back not elevated, but upper profile nearly straight from above 

 eye to near dorsal. Scales large, 36 or less in lateral line, and in

and posterior exposed as crescent. Interorbital broad, flattened. 

 Infraorbital large, covers most of cheek, surface with radiating 

 striae. Opercle striate, and subopercle projects moderately pos- 

 teriorly, both with striate surfaces. Occipital fontanel well devel- 

 oped, extends forward nearly to front of eyes. 



Gill-opening extends forward for last third in head. Gill-rakers 

 about 10 -\- 20 weak flexible filaments, about g length of gill-filaments, 

 and outer series separated by high cutaneous or cartilaginous parti- 

 tion. Gill-filaments about 2 in eye. Isthmus broad. Branchioste- 

 gals with inner shortest and outer longest. 



Scales large, firm, well exposed, in regular horizontal series, entire, 

 and more or less uniform except smaller ones on caudal base. Surface 

 of exposure of each scale pitted or with variously shaped shallow 

 cavities, not interfering with general smoothness to touch. Long 

 pointed free scaly flap in axil of ventral. Lateral line complete, 

 midway along side, of simple lubes and each opening by pore at 

 middle of scale exposure. 



Dorsal origin midway between that of adipose fin and snout tip, 

 first branched ray longest with fourth simple but slightlj- shorter, 

 anil fin depressed slightly more than half way to caudal base. Adi- 

 pose fin inserted about midway between elepressed dorsal tij) and 

 caudal base, fin small. Anal inserted slightly before adipose fin, 

 first branched ray longest, lower edge of fin slightly emarginated, 

 and when depressed reaches caudal base. Caudal well forked, hjbes 

 broad, apparently (damaged) eqtial. Pectoral low, pointed, reaches 

 about x'f) to ventral, and latter inserted behind second branched 

 dorsal ray base, readies f to anal. Vent close before anal. 



Color in alcohol largely pale browiiish, groundcolor mostly 

 uniform. Above lateral line four lengthwise deejier brownish bands;

HEMIODOXTIX.E. 

 Hemiodus semitseniatus Kner. 



One example 83 mm. long (caudal tips damaged), agrees with 

 Kner's account. The depth (4^) is probablj- due to age, as all the 

 other characters are in accord. The scales (according to the pockets) 

 are 55 in 1. 1. to caudal base and 3 more on latter, besides 9 above 

 I. 1. Eigenmann identifies examples from Konawaruk and Gluck 

 Island with this species,^ though they are likely wrongly so called, 

 as they show the depth 4 to 45 and the scales 44 or 45 in 1. 1., with 

 only 7 above.

Two examples, one 195 mm. and the other 126 mm. Compared

 scales: snout 2^ in head; eye 5 to 6; maxillary 3 to 3|. In color 

 these examples show a dark or dusky spot on each scale of sides and 

 back. Dark spots on head large and irregular on front and snout, 

 .small and less numerous on check and opcrde. Dorsal with large 

 broad distal l)lackish blotch, and another blackish streak transversely 

 subbasally. Broad dark lateral band includes 1. 1. and extends out

Chalceus macrolepidotns Cuvipr. 



Two examples, 150 to 157 ram. The>- differ slightly from Pelle- 



grinina hrternlepift Fowler.'* The latter has shorter pectorals, a 



broader snout, dusky fins, nearlj* even jaws, pectoral reaches beyond 



ventral origin, and adipose eyelid absent, etc. The erroneous 



locality was doulitless due to the mixing of collections in the Academy 



from West Africa and Surinam or some other part of South America. 



I .shall therefore admit the nominal Pcllegrinina as identical, following 



Regan.

 Amazon.'* It differs, however, in having the light predorsal streak 

 continuous from the head to the origin of the dorsal fin. The 

 Rupununi examples show it only for the first quarter or third of this 

 region. They also show the following: Head 5§ to 6|; depth 5^ 

 to 5|; A. 150? to 160?; scales about 72 to 90 in 1. 1. according to 

 tubes and pores; 15 to 18 scales above 1. 1., opposite pectoral tip, 

 counted to median line of back; 3 or 4 scales above 1. 1. to dorsal

 1. 1. at greatest body depth; snout 2| to 2| in head; interorbital 

 45; maxillary If to If in snout; eye 3| to 5^; gill-rakers 2 + 5 or 6. 

 These two examples also differ from one another in respect to color, 

 the larger having a black and rather long slender caudal peduncle. 

 The smaller has a very constricted caudal peduncle, marked by a 

 dusky blotch, and the caudal dusky, while in the larger example 

 the caudal is white.

This species is closely related to Slurisotna rostruta (Spix) and, 

 as compared with the specimen Cope recorded from the Peruvian 

 Amazon as Lnricaria roslmtnp differs in the coloration. Cope's 

 exami)le also shows the fins less produced and two plates each side 

 imposing between plate containing vent and preanal.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANATOMY OF THE. ILYSIID.a:. 



BY JOSEPH C. THOMPSON, SURGEON, U. S. N. 



Three specie.s of thi.s family have recently been the subjects of an 

 autopsy. A few additional secondarj^ characters have been learned, 

 but none were of the primary importance of those already knowai, 

 and which have been employed by Mr. Boulenger to maintain the 

 group as a family. 



The salient character found to be common to the three species 

 studied, was the comparatively large diameter of the segment of the 

 posterior vena cava that is just caudad to the heart. A generic 

 character of rather ^n unusual nature was found in Cylindrophis, 

 consisting of a bridge of connective tissue in the floor of the mouth, 

 that extends between the sheath of the tongue and the lip. 

 Ilysia scytale (LinnKus). • 



This species has been made the subject of several pages by Dr. 

 Beddard.' The characters of an example just studied conform with 

 those touched on in the article, with the exception of the position 

 of the liver. By Dr. Beddard, this organ was found to commence 

 "just at the heart as in Vipers. " In the present example the anterior 

 tip of the liver was 37 mm. posterior to the apex of the heart. 



A comparison of the measurements brings out the point that the 

 only difference between the two specimens is in the position of the 

 liver. '"

 total length 480, tail 20 mm. 



Squnmation. — The number of scale row.s, the sequence in which 

 they are added, suppressed, and the gastrostege level at which these 

 changes occur, are as follows: 



19 rows, VI row added, right .55th, loft 53d gastrostege, making: 

 21 rows, V row ends, right 2()()lh, left 202d gastrostege, leaving: 

 19 rows, VI row ends, right 22()th, left 221.st gastrostege, leaving: 

 17 rows, which are continued to the vent. 



Gastrosteges 236; anal divided; urosteges 12 and a terminal 

 scute, the first and second paired,, the remainder entire. Frontal 

 barely touching the occijiital; supraocular larger than the i^arietal; 

 supralabials 5, the third and fourth touching the ocular shield; 

 infralal)ials 5, the first pair the deepest and in contact behind the 

 long mental; a single pair of large geneials which are not in contact; 

 three azygos gular shields. 



Anatomy. — The tracheal cartilages terminate at the level of the 

 61st gastrostege. The tracheal membrane is narrow and is not lined 

 with i)ulmonary tissue. The right lung extends from the 57th to 

 the 135th gastro.stege; it is 152 mm. long, and lined throughout with 

 pulmonary tissue. There is a small free apex, 2.5 mm. long, that 

 extends to the 57th gastrostege; it is in relation with the right side 

 of the trachea, and the lumen is continuous with that of tlic lung. 

 Tiie lung terminates in a hhmt end which is 3.3 mm. in diameter. 

 The left lung, 5.5 mm. long, extemls from the 58th to the 61st gastro- 

 stege. It is in relation above with the end of the trachea and the 

 right lung, to the right with the apex of the heiftt and the inferior 

 vena cava, below with the v<'ntral wall of tlie pleural cavity, and to 

 the left with the stomach. It is lineti with jiulmunary tissue through- 

 out. The left bronchu.i opens from the ventral side of the trachea 

 opposite the 60th gastrostege. It enters the lung at the junction 

 of the middle and the posterior one-third. The liver in this species 

 and in Cylindrophis rufus Is peculiar in that macroscopically it 

 appears finely reticulate, with lines composed of minute l>lack dots. 



The anterior ]iortion of the liver from the tip to the level of the 

 r26th gastro.stege is comjKxsed of the left lobe, along tlie right side 

 of which courses the large inferior vena cava. At the r26tii ga.stro- 

 stege this ves.sel begins to furrow the ventral and left side of the 

 liver and divides the organ into right and left ioljcs. These lobes 

 continue posteriorly; the right, which is 6 mm. the longer, ter- 

 minating at the 147th, ami the left at the 144th ga-^trostego.

The coiled portion of the ileum terminates at the 209th gastro- 

 stege; the remainder, 9 mm. in length, is straight. 



The ileo-coecal valve is at the 214th gastrostege. 



The cwcal pouch, 8.5 mm. long, extends from the 214th to the 

 209th gastrostege; it lies between the right oyiduct and the terminal 

 straight portion of the ileum. 



The junction of the ileum and cfficum, and the csecal pouch are 

 subject to a wide range of variation in different species, and are 

 worthy of being recorded in detail. 



The posterior vena cava is anomalous owing to its large diameter, 

 which is 2.5 mm. Upon opening the coelum, just caudad to the 

 heart, this vessel appears as if it svere the liver. The illusion is 

 increased as just posterior to the apex of the heart this vein is sharply 

 flexed towards the dorsal wall, and from below, this bend looks 

 exactly like the blunt tip of a liver. 



The external landmarks of the principal viscera in terms of gastro- 

 steges are as follows:

The scale formula in this specimen is abnormal. It will be noted 

 that the first row to be added was the VI, and the first to be sup- 

 pressed was the V, and the next to be dropped was the VI. 'The 

 normal condition would have been for the VI to be the first sup- 

 pressed followed by the V. 



Over five hundred specimens of various species have recently been 

 investigated for this scale formula character. In the normal state, 

 when a certain scale row is added anteriorly and further along the 

 body begins to tai^er and a reduced count occurs, this reduced coimt 

 is regularly brought about by the suppression posteriorly of the same 

 scale row that was added. Where several rows are added and later 

 these are suppressed, the sequence of suppression is regularly in an 

 inverse order to that in which they appeared. 



The scale formula of a different specimen having 226 gastrosteges 

 was as follows :

CYLINDKOPHIS Wagler. 



Since the publication of the Catalogue of the Snakes in the British 

 Museum, there have been described two new^ species belonging to 

 the Ilysiidoe. Both of these new forms arc in the genus Cylindrophis, 

 the species of which maj' be distinguished as follows: 



I — Diameter of the eye about half its distance from the nostril. 



Interocular width more than the length of the snout r.ufus. 



Interocular width ecjual to the length of the snout isolepis. 



II — Diameter of the eye one-third to one-fourth its distance from' 

 the nostril. 

 A — Ventrals not twice as large as the contiguous scales. 



Scales in 23 rows opisthorhodits. 



Scales in 21 to 19 rows niaculatus. 



B — Ventrals nearly twice as large as the contiguous scales. 

 Scales in 21 rows linentus. 



Cylindrophis rufus (Laurenti). 



Specimen. — California Acad. Sci., No. 33,054. Sarawak, Borneo. 

 Male; total length 4.54, tail 11 mm. 



Squamation. — The number of scale-rows on the body, the sequence 

 in which they become suppressed, and the gastrostege level at which 

 they terminate arc as follows: 



Neck: 

 21 rows, I\"r()w ends, right 8th, teft 8th gastrostege, leaving: 



Body: 

 19 rows, \' row ends, right 19oth, left 190th gastrostege, leaving: 

 17 rows, which are continued to the vent. 



Gastrosteges 202; anal divided; urosteges G, second and fourth 

 dividcil, the remainder entire. Priefrontal enters the' eye; frontal 

 larger than the supraocular, larger than the parietal, longer than its 

 distance from the rostral: a small post ocular: supralabials ti, the 

 third and fourth entering the eye; infralabials 0; a single pair of 

 geneials; one pair and two azygos gular shields. 



Anatomy. — The tracheal membrane is narrow and is not lined with 

 pulmonary tissue. The trachea terminates just caudad to the left 

 bronchus. The right intra pulmotiary bronchus terminates at the 

 61st gastrostege. It appears as the narrowed continuation of the

trachea. At first it is a gutter of bronchial tissue, from tlie edges of 

 which the ends of the cartilages project into the lumen of the lung 

 for a distance of .3 mm. 



The right lung extends from the 54:th to the 114th gastrostege. 

 • It is lined with pulmonary tissue to about the 100th gastrostege; 

 the terminal portion ends as a blunt and stout-walled anangious 

 air-sac. There is an apex, 2.5 mm. long, and adherent to the right 

 side of the trachea. The wall between tiie apex and the trachea is 

 formed of pulmonarj- tissue alone, there being no fibrous tissue 

 dividing the two structures. The lumen of the apex opens into the 

 lung by a simple tube that is pentagonal in shape and appears to be 

 a single air-cell that is deeper than the rest. 



The left lung, 6 mm. long, is lined with air-cells. The bronchus, 

 at the level of the o8th gastrostege, is a minute opening from the 

 ventral wall of the trachea. 



The left lobe of the liver extends from the 73d to the 111th gastro- 

 stege. At this point the posterior vena cava begins to furrow the 

 organ and to form the right lobe. Posteriorly the two lobes end 

 nearly at the same level, the right being but 1.5 mm. the longer. 



The gall-bladder is 6 mm. long. The cystic duct flows forward for 

 1.5 mm., and is composed of several tubes. The hepatic duct divides 

 into several branches; these anastomose with the cystic duct to form 

 a complex rete which is 7 mm. long and flows anteriorly to enter the 

 pancreas. The usual condition in serpents is for the hepatic and 

 cystic ducts to join posteriorly to the gall-bladder. 



The ileum is lined with fine longitudinal folds. The last loop is 

 at the 172d gastrostege; from this point it is nearly straight. At 

 the 176th gastrostege there is a sacculated dilatation 3 mm. long and 

 about one-half again the diameter of the gut. The walls are thin 

 and pellucid and the lining is smooth. 



The ccecum is lined with deep longitudinal plicae and there are no 

 transverse septal folds. The ileo-ccecal valve is at the 193d gastro- 

 stege. The caecal pouch is small, being 2.5 mm. long and of about 

 the same diameter; it lies dorsad to the ileum. 



The intercostal arteries are regular, being one for each space. 

 Each arises as a single artery that bifucates below the median line, 

 one fork entering on either side. 



The teeth are of moderate size; the maxillary bears 11, the palatine 

 6, the pterygoid 5, and the dentary bone 12 teeth. 



The floor of the mouth presents unusual conditions. The mandible 

 bends towards the median line, and the anterior tip of the dentary 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



bone protrudes through the floor of the mouth for a distance of 1 mm. 

 The tip is covered with pad of fibrous tissue and the mucous mem- 

 brane. The opening of the sheath of the tongue is 3 mm. from the 

 lip. A tough band of fibrous tissue, which is furrowed above for the 

 tongue, extends between this opening and the lip. This band is 

 attached anteriorly and posteriorly; beneath it is free and forms a 

 bridge under which an instrument may be passed. Between the 

 anterior attachment of this bridge ami the tip of each dontary bone, 

 is an opening into a pouch which lies on either side of the median 

 line. Each pouch is covered above by the mucous membrane of 

 the mouth, and extends posteriorly to the level of the opening of the 

 sheath of the tongue. These pouches are in communication with 

 each other beneath the bridge of connective tissue that extends 

 from the opening of the sheath of the tongue to the lip. 



The external landmarks of the principal viscera in terms of gastro- 

 steges are as follows:

In this species it will be noted that the scale-row count of 21 

 terminaft>s well forward on the neck, and that the count of 19 per- 

 sists nearly to the vent. 



A uniform scale-row count over the entire body i.s found in two 

 types of serpents. It occurs in those with cylindrical bodies in which 

 there is no reduction of the diameter posteriorly and also in those 

 in which the body tapers posteriorly. The majority of those in the 

 latter category arc in widelj' separated genera belonging to the 

 Colubridae. These genera with tapering Inxlies have one character 

 in common and that is the scale-row count is regularly a low one, 

 being usually 17, 15, or 13 row.s throughout. In these serpents the 

 scales accommodate themselves to the narrowing of the Ixxly l)y 

 becoming smaller. 



In the majority of species the tapering of the Ijody is associated 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENXES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



with a reduced scale count posteriorly. In each species this reduced 

 scale count is brought about by the loss of definite scale rows. The 

 discovery of this phenomenon was made l)y Mr. Ruthven while 

 studying the genus Thamnophis.^ 



Two additional characters bearing on this subject may be entered 

 into. If a series of one species is critically recorded, it will be found 

 that not only is there a definite sequence of suppression, but that a 

 given scale row terminates at aVjout the same relative position on 

 the spinal column in each specimen. Also, that the suppression of 

 a scale row is in fairly definite relation to the posterior end of an 

 underlying organ. 



It is to be understood that these two characters are stated in 

 general terms. Barring individual variation, for which no allowance 

 can be made, they will be found to hold with satisfactory constancy. 



Bibliography. — The original description of this species is contained 

 on page 71 of the Synopmn ReptiUum by Laurenti, published in 1768. 

 In this work the serpent was named Anguis ruffa. Throughout 

 literature it has been referred to by the emended name of rufa. It 

 is probably only a question of time before some philologist will 

 insist that the current term be again emcntled ami that the original 

 incongruous spelling be perpetuated.

air-cells. The right lung extends from the 58th to the 98th gastro- 

 stege and is lined throughout with respiratory tissue. The apex 

 is adherent at the trachea. The left lung is 5 mm. long and contains 

 air-cells; anteriorly it is narrow and posteriorly broad and truncate. 

 The left bronchus is at the 60th gastrostege and enters at the middle 

 of the lung. 



The liver begins at the 78th gastrostege. At the 91st gastrostege 

 there is an S-shapcd kink in the organ, the recurrent limb of which 

 is 6 mm. long, and lies to the right and above the anterior portion. 

 The liver reaches to the 113th gastrostege; at this point the end 

 bends downwartl and forward for a distance of 3 mm. Whatever 

 may have been the cause of the kink in the liver, it apparently in no 

 way affected the right lung. The liver from the anterior tip to the 

 first bend in the kink lies to the left and below the lung; the recur- 

 rent limb of the kink is ventrad to the lung; the liver posterior to 

 the second bend in the kink lies to the right and below the lung. 

 In other words, the lung is perfectly straight and lies at first to the 

 right side, then above the kink, and finally to the left side of the 

 liver. A similar flexure of the liver has been observed in a female 

 Tropiclonotus vibakari Boie, containing embryos that were nearly 

 mature. 



The (Tsophagus at the 9Gth gastrostege makes a Z-shaped bend: 

 the recurrent limb of whicii is 4 m. long, and is directed forwards 

 and to the left. This bend is in the horizontal plane and is just 

 caudad to the S-shaped kink in the liver. 



The posterior vena cava is of large calibre; it has two kinks, one 

 just caudad to the left lung, and the other 8 mm. anterior to tlic 

 tij) of the liver. 



Wlutiier these kinks in the various organs are deformities or are 

 part of the displacement of the viscera during the latter weeks of 

 pregnancy is not certain. 



The ileo-carnl valve is at the 182d gastrostege. The co'cal pouch 

 is (i mm. long and the apex is at the 177th gastro.stege. It is of the 

 same diameter as the ciccum and lies between the ileum and the 

 right ovary. 



The teeth are less in number than in C. rufu.i. The maxiUary 

 bears 8, the jialatine 7, the pterygoid 4, and the dentarj" bone 11 

 teeth. 



The floor of the mouth has the protruding tips of the maxillary 

 bones and the two pouches on cither side of the median line quite 

 as described in ('. rufus. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 293 



There are three embryos; these extend from the 118th to the 

 178th gastrostege. The growth of the anterior one has been aborted, 

 evidently owing to pressure. The middle one has a j-olk sac 25 mm. 

 long, on the dorsal and anterior surface of which is coiled the embryo. 

 The head is free, being beneath and anterior to the coils. The pre- 

 vailing condition is for the head to be in the centre of the coils, where 

 it is more protected. The total length of the embryo, when uncoiled, 

 is about 45 mm. The tail measures 2 mm., which is longer propor- 

 tionately than in the adult. Each rudimentary hind limb is free; 

 it is held at right angles to the body and measures .5 mm. in length. 

 The yolk sac of the posterior embryo measures 36 mm. 



A well-nourished fat-body lies between the bend in the oesophagus 

 and the first embryo. 



The external landmarks of the principal viscera in terms of gastro- 



steges are as follows:

 is noted. This number is then divided by the total number of 

 gastrosteges in the specimen, thereby giving the position in terms 

 of percentage.

Introduction and Methods. 



In the invfstitration lioro rccordeil tlircc ohjccts have been kept 



in view: (1) To determine pliy.siologically llie relative sensitivene.-i.s 



of ants and hornets to different odors, so tliat it may lie expre.s.sed 



niimeriealiy for comparison luider different conditions; (2) to locate 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHrLADELPHIA. 295 



the olfactory organs; and (3) to determine morphologically the 

 relative sensitiveness of different species of Hymenoptera to odors. 

 The study of the behavior of normal ants and hornets under experi- 

 mental conditions is used as a basis for correctly interpreting the 

 observations on these insects made abnormal for the purpose of 

 obtaining data which concern the first two objects in view. 



Many entomologists have had something to say about the seat of 

 the organs of sm?ll in insects, but most of the views are purely 

 speculative. A few have done extensive and thorough experimental 

 work to determine the location of this sense. However, since they 

 have failed to study sufficiently the behavior of the insects investi- 

 gated, the responses observed have misled them in determining the 

 seat of the olfactory organs. It is now generally believed that the 

 antennae bear the organs of smell, but as all the antennal organs are 

 covered with a hard ifcembrane the objection has been raised that 

 such organs cannot receive olfactory stimuli. Hicks (1857) dis- 

 covered some peculiar organs on the bases of the wings and on the 

 legs of insects and suggested that they have an olfactory function. 

 The writer (1914) made a comprehensive study of these organs in 

 the honey bee. He experimentally proved that they have an olfac- 

 tory function and for this reason called them olfactory pores. The 

 present paper embodies the results of a comparative study on 

 Hymenoptera in much the same manner as pursued on the honey bee. 



To obtain material for the study of the disposition of the organs 

 described by Hicks, adult specimens were used. The legs and wings 

 were pulled off at their articulations, and the thoraces and abdomens 

 were slit open. These parts were put into a cold saturated solution 

 of caustic potash, where they remained one to three days, depending 

 on the size of the material. When removed from this solution the 

 material was washed thoroughly in water and then was decolorized 

 with chlorine gas in the following manner: A small quantity of 

 potassium chlorate was put into a small wide-mouthed liottle. All 

 the parts belonging to a specimen were loosely wrappefl in a small 

 piece of cheesecloth which was suspended in the neck of the bottle. 

 Then a pipettcful of hydrochloric acid was dropped upon the 

 potassium chlorate in the bottom of the bottle. At once chlorine 

 gas was liberated which soon bleached the dark colored specimen. 



To obtain material for the study of the internal anatomy of the 

 organs herein discussed, pupal insects were mostly used. The 

 appendages and bodies of the pupae were cut into small pieces, which 

 were immediately dropped into Carnoy's fluid (equal parts of abso- 




296 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



lute alcohol, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid, with corrosive 

 sublimate to excess). For embedding, the double method of cel- 

 loidin and paraffin was employed. Serial sections cut six and ten 

 microns thick w'ere stained with Ehrich's hamatoxylin and oesin. 

 For further details in regard to technique the reader is referred to 

 the writer's work on the honey bee. 



The writer is indebted to the following persons: to Messrs. J. ('. 

 Crawford, H. L. Viereck and S. A. Rohwer of the U. S. National 

 Museum and the Bureau of Entomology for all the dried specimens 

 used; to ]Mr. Rohwer the writer is particularly grateful for the 

 systematic arrangement and names of most of the specimens inchuled 

 in the table, pages 330 to 334; to Mr. Theo. Pergande for identifying 

 the ants used; to Miss Mabel Colcord for assistance in obtaining 

 references; and to Emma Pabst Mclndoo, the writer'.s wife, for 

 translating some of the foreign works. , 



A. THE OLFACTORY SENSE OF ANTS AND HORNETS. 



In order to keep ants in the laboratory, several mollified Fielde 

 ant nests were constructed. Colonies of various species were con- 

 fined in these nests. The behavior of the ants in the nests was 

 carefully studied and this behavior was used as a standard for 

 judging the behavior of all the ants used singly in the various experi- 

 ments. Many females of Camponotus^ were found in rotten stumps 

 and logs in the w'oods. Some of them had no eggs, some had only a 

 few eggs, while others had several eggs, a few larvi=e, and a few pupa;. 

 Each female with her own brood, if IjtoocI w-as found in her nest, 

 was put into a honey-bee queen cage. This cage is 31 inches long, 

 22 inches wide and J inch deep. 



To study the behavior of one colony of Formica obscuriventris 

 Forel in surroundings more natural than those afforded by using Fielde 

 nests, a large glass cage with four compartments was constructed. 

 The nest portion of the cage was 10 inches long, 10 inches wide and 

 16 inches tall. The entrance of the nest was 10 inches long, 10 inches 

 wide and 8 inches tall. This compartment was raised 8 inches above 

 the table so that one end of it cunnected with the upper half of one 

 side of the nest. The run-way was 8 inches long, 4 inches wide and 

 1 inch dee]). This was also supported 8 inches above the table. 

 One end of it connected with the distal end of tiie nest entrance and 

 the other end connected with the fourth compartment, the manger. 



' Here as elsewhere in thi.s paper unle.'w otherwise indicated is meant the 

 large brownish variety of Canqtonotus jwnasylvanicua Say. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 



The manger, or feeding compartment, was 10 inches long, 8 inches 

 wide and 8 inches tall. It and the nest were not elevated above 

 the top of the table. The tops and bottoms of all four compart- 

 ments were glass, except the bottom of the run-way, which was 

 perforated tin. To make the bottoms of the nest and manger water- 

 tight an additional bottom made of plaster of Paris was added to 

 each of these compartments. The joints of the cage were so securely 

 covered with adhesive cloth and the tops fitteil so snugly that 

 vapor collected on the tops and was transformed into large drops of 

 water. A large colony of Formica was found in a rotten log. A 

 half-bushel of the rotten wood and perhajjs a quart of the ants with 

 brootl of all stages were placed into. the nest of the cage. 



A large flat piece of cotton wet with water was constantly kept 

 in each Fielde nest. A small piece of cotton was kept in each queen 

 cage, and a small amount of water was occasionally poured upon 

 the wood in the nest and twice a week water was put into the manger. 

 Honey, sugar syrup, queen-cage candy, live insects, and larvae of 

 various insects served as food. 



I. Experiments on Normal Ants and Hornets. 



To determine the relative sensitiveness of females, males, and 

 workers to various odors, under conditions which permitted of their 

 close observation, triangular experimental cases were used. These 

 were made of three narrow wooden strips, two of which were 5 and 

 the third 4 inches long, each strip being half an inch thick. Wire 

 screen served as a bottom and glass as a top for the case. The 

 apices and bases of these cases rested on two supports above a rigid 

 table and the table legs rested on a concrete floor, near a window. 

 Cheesecloth was spread across both supports, thus making a double 

 bottom for the cases. No screen was used to prevent the ants from 

 seeing the observer because they never showed any responses to the 

 movements made by the observer. 



The following sources of odor were used for determining the 

 reactions of the ants in the observation cases: Chemically pure 

 essential oils of peppermint, thyme, and wintergreen ; food — honey 

 and comb, parts of plant leaves, and bits of the stem of pennyroyal 

 [Hedonia pulegioides ?); ant secretion — formic acid. All these 

 substances except the last were kept in stoppered vials of the same 

 shape and size. The leaves and bits of the stem of the pennyroyal 

 were dried, but they still gave off a strong odor when the vial was 

 uncorked. The formic acid was obtained by squeezing the abdomen 




298 PROCEEDIXGS OF THE ACADEMY OF. [Apr.. 



of a larg(> worker of Formica or of Camponoluf<. This caused the 

 ant to discharge all of the formic acid stored up and some of it. lodged 

 on the tip end of the abdomen. The licjuid on the abdomen gave off 

 a penetrating odor wliich lasted four or five minutes. 



An ant or hornet was carefully removed from its nest or cage and 

 was placed into one of the experimental cases. When first put into 

 the case the insect usually wandered about for several minutes, but 

 finally became iiuiet. The insect was tested with each of the above 

 odors only when it became perfectly quiet, without even the antennae 

 being moved in the least. The stopper of a vial was quickly removed 

 and the vial was gently and slowly placed under the experimental 

 case directly beneath and within one-half inch of the individual 

 being tested. Occasionally the vial was placed a few inches in front 

 of the specimen, to test its ability of smelling for a short distance. 

 When using the odor from the formic acid, the ant whose abdomen 

 carried some of this acid was held by a pair of forceps under the 

 experimental case in the same position in which a via! was held. 

 When all of these precautions were taken, a normal ant or hornet 

 responds to anyone of these odors witliout failure. As a control, 

 an empty and odorless vial was now ami then placed under the 

 insects in the same manner. If by chance an ant or hornet moved 

 while the control test was being made, its behavior was quite different 

 from that ob.served when odors were vised. Only the first responses 

 have been recorded and in all cases where there was the least doubt 

 as to whether the insect moved forTiny reason other than the olfactory 

 stimulus, such movements were never recorded. The reaction time 

 was counted in .seconds. With an ordinary watch the minimum time 

 which can be definitely recorded is two seconds, although most of 

 the individuals resiionded to some of the odors much more promptly. 

 Owing to this source of error, the average recorded time is probably 

 double what it sliould be in the cases when the response was prompt. 

 An intermission of 10 minutes elapsed between any two tests in the 

 same experimental case. A few individuals were tested twice with 

 the same odor, but most of them were tested only once. 



In the following paragraphs are given the responses of the tiiree 

 castes of ants and oi work 'r hornets to the odors of the six different 

 substances and the average reaction times in seconds. In recording 

 the responses the term "vibrated" is uscfl to describe tiie rapid 

 movement of the antenn-v up and down or from side to side. Whi-n 

 this movement is slow they are descril)ed simi)ly as liaving "moved. " 

 Quite often an ant or hornet lies flat on it-^ tliorax and abdomen. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 299 



SO the word "arose" is to be interpreted as meaning that the insect 

 gets up and stands on its feet. In the averages of reaction times 

 the prol^able error is presumably high. It has not been calculated 

 since slight differences in reaction time are not considered as signifi- 

 cant in the discussion of results. All anthropomorphic terms are 

 put in quotation marks.

 was spent while waiting for them to become quiet. These females 

 and 23 more normal ones, making 48 in all, were put into a small 

 wooden box half full of rotten wood. An equal number of sister 

 females with their funiculi cut off were also put into the box at the 

 same time. They were given food and water. The normal ants 

 lived from 1 to 23 days with an average of 14 days and 10 hours.

The average reaction time of all six odors for the 25 large workers 

 tested is 3.22 seconds. These ants were kept in a Fielde nest with 

 many more workers and males. Between May 24 and July 5, 19 

 workers of various sizes had died. These 19 liveil from 47 to 72 

 days, with 26 days and 8 hours as an average. 



5. Minor Workers of Camponotus. 



To ascertain if the smallest workers of a colony of ants respond 

 as quickly to odor stimuli as do the largest workers of the same 

 colony, 25 small workers were tested. These were sisters to the 

 large workers just described and were taken from the same colony. 

 The responses of the small workers to the six odors were similar to 

 those of the large workers. In two instances when the ant was 

 tested with honey and comb, it tried to get at the source of the odor. 

 In one instance when the ant was tested with formic acid, it turned 

 around quickly and turned uji the abdomen as if going to discharge 

 its own formic acitl. 



The reaction times for the 25 small workers are: oil of peppermint, 

 2-3 seconds, average 2.12 seconds; oil of thjine, 2-3 seconds, average 

 2.08 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2^ .seconds, average 2.00 seconds; 

 honey and comb, 2-10 seconds, average 4.84 seconds; leaves and 

 stems of pennyroyal. 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seccmds; formic 

 acid, 2-8 seff)nds, average 3.72 .seconds. The average reaction time 

 of all six odors for the 25 small workers tested is 3.09 seconds. 



Only 2 soldiers were tested. They were si.sters to the workers 

 just described. Their reaction times are similar to tho.se of the 

 other workers. 



6. /'Vwirt/fs of Vespula fiwculata . 



A large hornets' (Vcspida rnaculatn) nest, cimtaining many adult 

 hornets and all stages of young, was susjiemlol insi<le a large wire- 

 screen cage. Twenty-five of the adult worker hornets were removed 

 from the cage, and they were then placed singly into the experimental 




ISl'i-] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 305 



cases. A piece of queen-cage candy and a piece of cotton wet with 

 water were also placed into each case. The hornets were not "at 

 home " at all in these cases. They were extremely restless, wandered 

 about inside the case for some time, and with their powerful mandi- 

 bles tore the large piece of candy into many bits, but ate very little 

 of it. All of those that failed to become quiet after such a confine- 

 ment for a few hours were discarded and others were used. When 

 tested with the three essential oils, they responded promptly. Most 

 of the responses were similar to those of normal ants, but one charac- 

 teristic response not observed, when experimenting with ants, was 

 that the hornets seemed to notice the odor; this means that the hornet 

 turned its head toward the floor of. the case as if watching from 

 whence the odor was coming, and sometimes it grabbed a wire in 

 the l)ottom just above the top of the vial. If the hornets saw the 

 vial during these tests they were compelled to see through both the 

 wire-screen bottom and the cheesecloth bottom. It was also neces- 

 sary to place a cheesecloth screen between them and the observer 

 to prevent them from noticing the observer's movements. They 

 were confined singly in these cases until they died. They lived 

 from^ie hours to 17 days and 21 hours, with an average of 9 days 

 and 7 hours. The reaction times are : oil of peppermint, 2-3 seconds, 

 average 2.12 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-4 seconds, average 2.56 seconds- 

 oil of wintergreen, 2-4 seconds, average 2.60 seconds. These give a 

 general average of 2.43 seconds. 



II. Experiments on Ants and Hornets with Mutilated 



Antenna. 



Since it is now generally believed that the olfactory organs of 

 insects are located in the antenna?, and to determine whether the 

 olfactory organs of ants and hornets are located in these appendages, 

 the antenniB were mutilated, the l^ehavior of the mutilated insects 

 was then studied, and later these insects were tested with odors as 

 usual. 



1. Funiculi of ants cut off. 



The funiculi of 12 workers of Formica were cut off with a small 

 pair of sharp scissors and these mutilated ants with 12 umnutilated 

 normal sisters were placed into a Fieldc nest. When a funiculus 

 M-as cut off, a small drop of yellowish blood exuded from the wound. 

 The mutilated ants when put into the nest cleaned, off the exuded 

 blood. They were slightly hostile to each other and to their unmu- 

 tilated sisters. When a bee and a fly were put into the nest, the 




306 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OK . [Ajjr., 



mutilated ants did not offer to catch the strange insects, but the 

 unmutihited sisters lost no time in catching them. Onlj' one of 

 the 12 mutilated ants ate food, the other 11 stood quietly In- the 

 food as if ready to attack an enemy. All of the 12 unmutilatcd ants 

 greedily ate the food. 



Fifty workers of Formica were removed one at a time from the 

 large glass cage. The funiculi of each were cut off and then the 

 in.sect was returned to the cage. A small drop of yellowish blood 

 exuded from every wound. Each mutilated ant was iiuite irritai)lc 

 and invarialily attacked one or more sisters, and as a result several 

 ants were killed. 



The funiculi of 2 soldiers, 10 large workers, and 7 small workers 

 of Camponotu.-i were cut off. These mutilated sister ants were then 

 put into a Fielde nest. For three hours thereafter they were (piite 

 irritable and fought each other, then they became very inactive and 

 when tested with oil of ])epi)erniint, they responded slowly by 

 moving away. The next day lliey were still (juite inactive and 

 "paid no attention" to anything, excijit when they came in contact 

 with each other, they still fought one another. When testeil with 

 odors they failed to respond. At no lime did they eat or drink. 



The funiculi of 30 winged virgin females of Formiai were cut ofY. 

 AVhen each ant(>nna was severed a small jiencil brush wet with 95 

 per cent, alcohol was a]ii)lied to the wound for several secontls. 

 This seemed to check the flow of bhuid.iiut iliil not sto)) it (Mvlirely. 

 .V half-hour after the funiculi had been cut off tiicse ants were placed 

 singly into the experimental cases. They wandered about inside 

 the cases considerably, and when they stopped wandering they 

 stroked th(> stubs of the antenna" incessantly and as a rule were very 

 inactive. When tested with the three essential oils — jjeiipermint, 

 thyme, anfl wintergreen — their responses were less pronounced 

 than were those of umnutilated ants. .\s a whole, their resjionses 

 were uncertain, but were of the same nature as those of unnmtilated 

 ants. Sometimes, instead of giving the usual response, they moved 

 or vibrated one or more legs. Sometimes an ant grabbed a wire in 

 the bottom of the ca.><e and held on to it tenai-iously and did not 

 react at all to odors. Five of them failed to resjiond to odors and 

 scarcely moved when touched with a jjencil. These ants were dLs-r 

 carded from the ex])eriments. The other 25 were tested with the 

 three essential oils. Their reaction times are: oil of pepjjermint, 

 2-10 seconds, average 3.08 seconds; oil of thyme, 2 15 seconds, 

 average 4.48 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2 20 seconds, average 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 



5.60 seconds. These give a general average of 4.38 seconds, while 

 the same average for unmutilated sister females is 2.12 seconds. 

 Confined in a Fielde nest, these mutilated ants lived from 4 to 22 hours, 

 with only 19 hours as an average. Since these ants were abnormal, 

 it is reasonable to attribute the difference of 2.26 seconds in reaction 

 time to the inactiveness of the insects, and it is certain that the 

 inactiveness was brought al^out by the operation. 



2. Funiculi of a)its covered icith glue. 



Thirty winged virgin females of Formica from the lar^e glass cage 

 were fastened to a pine board with pins. One pair of pins was 

 placed x-wise over the petiole and another pair was stuck into the 

 board in the same manner between the head and the thorax. With 

 a small pencil brush the entire surfaces of both funiculi were covered 

 with a thin coat of liquid glue. After an interval of 1.5 minutes the 

 glue had become perfectly dry, the ant was unpinned and was put 

 into an experimental case. When unpinned from the board the 

 ants ran rapidly, but for a few moments thereafter when placed 

 into the cases they moved about more or less "crazily" and then 

 became so quiet that it was not necessary to wait on them to come to 

 rest. Five failed to respond to odors and when touched lightly 

 with a pencil they scarcely moved, but when touched harder they 

 jumped up quickly and ran about "crazily." These five were 

 discarded from the experiments with odors. All the ants with 

 glued antennae were quite abnormal, because they did not move when 

 mechanically irritated unless really compelled to move. When 

 tested with the three essential oils some responded promptly while 

 others hesitated to respond. As a whole their responses were about 

 as pronounced as, and were similar to, those of unmutilated sister 

 females. Often instead of responding in the usual manner they 

 moved or vil^rated one or more legs. Their reaction times are: 

 oil of peppermint, 2-15 seconds, average 6.08 seconds; oil of thyme, 

 3-15 seconds, average 6.40 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2-10 seconds, 

 average 4.88 seconds. These give a general average of 5.78 seconds. 

 Since the behavior of these mutilated ants was abnormal and since 

 they lived from 1 to 12 days, \\ath only an average of 6 days, the 

 injury caused by the glue must certainly have brought about the 

 slow reaction time. 



3. Flagella of hornets cut off. 



The flagella of 25 Vespula rnaculata were cut off with a pair of sharp 

 scissors. A small drop of blood exuded from each wound. When 

 •21 




308 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF (Apr., 



these mutilated hornets were placed into the experimental cases, 

 they were at first extremely restless, then they became "sullen" 

 and inactive. 



Some of these mutilated hornets responded promptly when tested 

 with the three essential oils; some responded slowly, and a few 

 failed to respond at all. All of those which failed to respond to 

 odors scarcely moved when touched with a pencil. These were 

 discarded and the flagella of others were cut off. In behavior, hornets 

 with the flagella cut off are abnormal, and these lived from 3 hours 

 to 3 days and 20 hours with 1 day and 13 hours as an average. The 

 reaction times are: oil of peppermint, 2-.5 .-seconds, average 2.84 

 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-5 seconds, average 2.92 seconds; oil of 

 wintergreen 2-5 seconds, average 3.52 seconds. These give a 

 general average of 3.09 seconds which is 0.60 second greater than the 

 same average for normal hornets. We can certainly attribute this 

 small difference in reaction time to the inaetiveness of the mutilated 

 insects. 



III. Summary. 



The common response of all the normal ants tested to each of the 

 six odors used is as follows: (1) if lying flat on the thorax and 

 abdomen, they arose either slowly or (luickly ; (2) if standing on their 

 feet, they movetl away either slowly or cjuickly. The more conunon 

 response is — they vibrated the antenna and moved away either 

 slowly or ciuickly. The most- conunon response is — they vibrated 

 the antennje more or less vigorously. Many of the ants turned 

 around over the odors. While testing with honey and formic acid, 

 many of the ants tried to get through the bottoms ()f the cases to 

 the sources of the odors. In one instance while testing with formic 

 acid, the ant turned up its abdomen in the same position in which 

 the abdomen is held when the ant attacks an enemy. Tiie average 

 reaction times of all six odors for all the normal ants tested in any 

 one set of experiments are as follows: females of Formica 2.45 .seconds, 

 males of Formica 2.63 seconds, males of Camponolus 2.74 seconds, 

 major workers of Camponotus 3.22 .seconds, and minor workers of 

 Camponotus 3.09 seconds. The average reaction time of the three 

 essential oils for all the normal hornets tested is 2.43 seconds. From 

 these figures, it is evident that the olfactorj- sense in the ants and 

 hornets tested is quite acute. Judging from the reaction times of 

 the females and males of Formica, the olfactory sense in both sexes 

 is equally developed. The slightly slower reaction time of the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 



males may be due, however, to the fact that these males were young 

 and because they were not very active. The olfactory sense of the 

 males of Formica and of Camponotus seems to be about equalh' devel- 

 oped in both. The olfactory sense in the males of Camponotus seems 

 to be more highly developed than it is in the workers of the same 

 genus. There seems to be practically no difference in the ability 

 of the large and small workers of Camponotus to receive odor stimuli. 



Ants with the funiculi either cut off or covered with glue are not 

 normal and they do not live long. They soon become inactive and 

 sorne of them can hardly be mechanically irritated. Those which 

 almost fail to respond to mechanical stimuli never respond to odor 

 stimuli. These were discarded from the experiments in which 

 odors were used and all the others were tested with odors. The 

 average reaction times of the mutilated ants are about double those 

 of unmutilated sisters. The slowness in responding to odors is 

 probably due to the inactiveness of the mutilated insects. If the 

 slow reaction times indicate that some of the olfactory organs were 

 prevented from receiving odor stimuli, then the olfactory organs 

 that brought about the responses must be looked for elsewhere than 

 on the antennae. 



Hornets witli the antennae cut off are not normal and never live 

 long. The reaction time of hornets thus mutilated is only 0.66 

 second more than that of unmutilated hornets. ]\Iost of the olfac- 

 tory organs, if not all, of hornets must be looked for elsewhere than 

 on the antennae. 



IV. Morphology of the Olfactory Pores. 



Since the organs in the antennae of ants and hornets fail to receive 

 most, if not all, of the odor stimuli used in the preceding experiments, 

 and because the writer proved experimentally that the pores first 

 described by Hicks (1857) do receive odor stimuli in the honey bee, 

 these pores in ants and hornets will now be discussed. 



1. Disposition. 



In making a study of the disposition of the olfactory pores of ants 

 and hornets the following were used: five specimens each of winged 

 females, winged males, and major workers of Formica; five specimens 

 each of deiilated females, winged males, major and minor workers 

 of Camponotus; and one specimen of Vespula maculata. All the 

 wings and legs of all 36 specimens were examined carefully for pores. 

 Since the winged female of Formica is typical, its olfactory pores 




310

[Apr., 



will be described in detail and then the variations found in the other 

 above-enumerated individuals will be stated. 



(a) Winged Female of Formica. — The wings have dorsal and ventral 

 surfaces, and the legs may be divided for description into four sur- 

 faces. The inner surface faces the ant's bodj' and the outer surface 

 is directed from the body. The anterior surface faces the head,

while the jjosterior surface is directed backward. There are always 

 three groups of pores on the front wing, two on the hind wing, 

 three on the trochanter, and one on the femur of each leg. There 

 are also two groups of isolated pores on each trochanter and on each 

 til)ia. The groujjs are located as follows: Xos. 1 to n inclusive lie 

 on the i)ases of the wings, Xos. 1 and 2 (text fig. 1) being on the

ventral surface of the front wing and Xo. 3 (text fig. 2) on the dorsal 

 surface of the same wing; No. 4 (text fig. 2) lies on the dorsal sur- 

 face of the hind wing, and No. 5 (text fig. 1) lies on the ventral sur- 

 face of the same wing; Nos. 6 to 8 inclu.sive, always lie on the 

 trochanter at the distal end, Nos. 6 and 7 (text fig. 1) being on the 

 anterior surface, while No. 8 (text fig. 2) lies on the inner surface. 

 No. 9 (text fig. 2) always lies at the proximal end of the femur on 

 the posterior surface. Groups a and b of the isolated pores lie on 

 the trochanter, while groups c and d lie on the tibia. The groups 

 of isolated pores are not always constant in position, but are 

 usually located as follows: Group a (text fig. 1) lies on the outer 

 surface near the distal end of the trochanter and group b (text fig. 2) 

 is found near the proximal end of the same segment on the inner 

 surface. Groups c and d (text figs. 1 and 2) combined form a 

 horseshoe-shaped row of pores with the toe of the horseshoe lying 

 on the posterior surface at the proximal end of the segment, and the 

 sides of the horseshoe pass around the tibia in opposite directions 

 and end with the two heels lying on the anterior surface. In the 

 female of Formica, as well as in most ants, all the groups are quite 

 constant in number on all the legs ami wings and the positions of 

 those on the legs vary only slightly Ijy them rotating around the 

 segments. Those on the wings never vary in position. In fact, the 

 numljer of groups and their respective positions are almost identical 

 to those of the worker honey bee. 



For all five females of Formica examined, the groups of pores on 

 the wings and tliird pair of legs vary in regard to the number of pores 

 as follows: No. 1, 11 to 18, average 13; No. 2, 70 to 86, average 78; 

 No. 3, 60 to 74, average 69; No. 4, 9 to 13, average 12; No. 5, 35 to 

 39, average 37; No. 6, 4 to 8, average 5; No. 7, 17 to 19, average 

 18; No. 8, 6 to 9, average 8; No. 9, 9 to 11, average 9; group a, 

 3 to 6, average 5; group b, 3 to 5, average 4; group c, 1 to 6, average 

 3; group d, 4 to 5, average 5. The numbers of pores in the groups 

 on the first and second pairs of legs vary slightly more than those. on 

 the third pair of legs. On the first pair of legs there is a total average 

 number of 112 pores; on the second pair 116 pores; and on the 

 third pair 114 pores, making a total of 342 pores as an average for 

 all six legs of a female of Formica. The front pair of wings has 320 

 pores, while the hind pair has only 98 pores, making 418 pores for 

 all four wings. It is thus evident that an average female of Formica 

 has only 760 pores, while by referring to the table page 333 it is seen 

 that a worker honey bee has 2,204 pores. 




312 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OK [Apr., 



(6) Other A7its and Hornets Examined. — The groups of pores in the 

 other specimens of Formica and Camponotus examined are tolerably 

 constant in number and position. They are .so similar to those of 

 the females of Formica, that onlj- the total number of pores will be 

 given. Counting the pores for all five individuals in each set, the 

 total average number of pores is as follows: males of Formica — legs 

 356, legs and wings 892; major workers of Formica — legs 332; 

 dealated females of Camponotus — legs 317; males of Camponotus — 

 legs 322, legs and wings 1,090; major workers of Camponotus — legs 

 331; minor workers of Camponotus — legs 314. In regard to the 

 total number of pores on the legs, it is thus seen that there is practi- 

 cally no difference between the number on the legs of workers and 

 queens and only a few more on the legs of males, but the wings of 

 males have many more than do the wings of females. (For more 

 details see table, page 331.) 



The groups of pores in the worker hornet (Vcspula ludciilata) are 

 also quite constant in number and jiosition and reseml)le those of the 

 worker honey bee more than those of an ant. The group on the 

 femur is always double, consisting of two rows of jiores widely divided, 

 and for tliis r(>a>;<)n each row is regarded as a separate group. ( .roups 

 Nos. 7 and 9 on the leg of an ant also each consist of two rows of 

 pores, but since the two rows lie side by side th?y may be regarded 

 as only one group. Cirouj) No. (i of an ant is a straight row, while 

 the pores of the same group of a hornet are bunched, 'i'he other 

 groups of the hornet are quite -similar to those of the honey i)ee. 

 The total number of pores for the hornet examined is 1,9.^7. (See 

 table, page 333, for details.) 



The ]iores of an ant vary more in siz(> than do those of the hornet 

 or honey bee. Group No. 8 (Plate XI, fig. 3j- on the trochanters well 

 illustrates this. Here the largest pore is at least five times the size of 

 the smallest one. Those on the tibiff (fig. 4) also vary much. Tliose 

 on the wings (fig. 5) vary only slightly in size. In jiroportion to the 

 sizes of an ant and of a worker honey bee, the pores of the ant are 

 much larger. The ]iores of a hornet are jiroportionately as large 

 as those of the honey bee. 



2. Structure. 



(a) External Structure. — When examined under a low-power lens, 

 the olfactory pores may be easily mistaken for hair sockets from 



'.Ml fiKuro.-i, except text figures 1, 2, and 3, are numbered consecutivelv on 

 PLites XI and XII. 




1914.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 



which the hairs have been removed. When more carefully observed 

 under a high-power lens, a striking difference in external form is 

 seen. The pores appear as small bright spots when a strong trans- 

 mitted light is used. Each bright spot has a dark boundary or pore 

 wall (fig. 3, PorW). Near the centre of this boundary is a trans- 

 parent spot, the pore aperture, which may be round, oblong, or 

 slit-like. On the wings the pore apertures are always round or oblong 

 (fig. 5, PorAp) and never slit-like as on the legs (fig. 3, PorAp). At 

 the lowest focusing level any pore aperture, however, is perfectly 

 round. The boundary (fig. 3, PorB) of the pore is usually bordered 

 by a band of darker chitin. 



(6) Internal Structure. — All the olfactory pores studied are inverted 

 flask-shaped structures in which the bottoms of the flasks are chitin- 

 ous layers (fig. 6, ChL). These layers of chitin contain the pore 

 apertures and they form external coverings for the pores. In a 

 typical pore as found in the tibia of Formica, the neck [NkFl) of the 

 flask is wide and the mouth (Mo) is flaring. About two-thirds of 

 the space at the bottom of the flask is occupied by a chitinous cone 

 (Con). The cone generally stains less deeply than the surrounding 

 chitin (C7i), but is not separated from it. The apex of the cone is 

 hollow and extends to the neck of the flask. The sense cell (SC) 

 lies beneath the mouth of the flask. It is bipolar, long, and slender, 

 and comparatively large. The sense fiber (SF) of this cell is en- 

 larged at the apex of. the cone. Its peripheral end runs into the 

 hollow of the cone, pierces the bottom of the cone, and enters the 

 lowest portion of the pore aperture. The nerve fiber (fig. 13, NF) 

 of the sense cell joins a nerve cord. The nucleus (SCNuc) with its 

 nucleoli (SCAhicI) is always conspicuous. 



Now since the anatomy of a pore is understood, the external 

 appearance of a pore may be explained. The dark border of chitin 

 (fig. 3, PorB) around the boundary of the pore is due to the thick 

 chitin (fig. 13, aa) at the mouth of the flask. The boundary (fig. 3, 

 PorW) is the same as the greatest width of the flask. The bright 

 area inside the boundary is caused by the light having to pass through 

 only the chitinous cone (fig. 13, Con) and-the chitinous layer (fig. 13, 

 ChL). The aperture appears transparent because the sense fiber 

 (fig. 13, SF) and all the other tissues have been removed by the 

 caustic potash treatment. 



Sections through the tibia; of pupal nmddobbers throw some light 

 on the origin of the anatomy of a pore. Quite often very large cells 

 (Plate XII, fig. 38, SC) may be seen among the small hypodermal cells 




314 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



(HypS). This indicates that the sense cells are modified hypodermal 

 cells. It appears that the cone {Con) is formed after the surrounding 

 chitin is almost completed. In figure 38 the hjT^odermis (Hyp) has 

 shrunk a short distance from the chitin (Ch) drawing the hypodermal 

 strand (HypSt) an ecjual distance from the base of the cone (Con). 

 This strand probabl.y served as a passage-way for conveying a 

 hypodermal secretion which formed the cone. With Ehrlich's 

 hamatoxylin and oesin the outer margin (a) of the cone stains a 

 faint purple. The inner margin (6) is pink, having the same color 

 as that of the lowest strata (c) of the surrounding chitin. The 

 chitin at d is light yellow; at e, dark yellow, and ;it /, it is semi- 

 transparent. At these last three places it failed to stain. 



Judging from what can be gleaned from all the sections studied, 

 including those of the honey bee, the origin of these organ-; is probably 

 about as follows. In the early pupal stage, the hypodermis is thick, 

 no chitin is yet formed, and all the hypodermal cells have about the 

 same size. In the 10-day-old worker i)upu; of the honey bee neither 

 pores nor sense cells are found, but many large hypodermal cells 

 occur where the sense cells later appear. At this age the chitin and 

 hairs are being rapidly formed. A day later pores and sense cells 

 are found. The sense cells and flasks including the pore apertures 

 are then simultaneously formetl, while the cone and sense fiber are 

 later formations. Both jiok^s of the sense cell are formed as growing 

 processes. The peripheral pole unites with the pore aperture and 

 the inner one joins the nerve branch while the cone is being formed 

 by the hypodermal strand. 



The flasks vary much in diameter and length. The length always 

 depends on the thickness of the chitin. Figures 6 and 7 represent 

 the largest and smallest pores in the tibiaj of the pujial females of 

 Formica. Figures 8 to 11 represent the flasks as found in the wings 

 of the same iasect. Figure 8 is from group No. 2, and figure 9 is 

 from group No. 3 on the front wing. Figure 10 is from group No. 4, 

 and figure 11 is from group No. 5 on the hind wing. Figure 12 from 

 group No. 2 on the front wing shows the slight variations in size 

 of the flasks and also the bunch of sense cells (SC). Here none of 

 the pore apertures were discernible. Figures 13 and 14 show how the 

 pores, sense cells (<S'C'), ami hypodermis (Hyp) actually appear in 

 sections through the trochanters of the same insect. Figure 13 is 

 from group No. 7 and figure 14 is from group No. 8. Quite often 

 the sense cells (fig. 14, SC) lie among the hypodermal cells (HypS), 

 and hypodermal strands (HypSt) may be seen running toward and 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 31-5 



into the cones, again indicating that the sense cells are modified 

 hypodennal cells and that the hypodermis forms the cones about the 

 time when the other chitin is completed. Hair-mother cells (HrMS) 

 forming the hairs are also common. Figure 15 is a pore from group 

 No. 6 and figiu'e 16 is an isolated pore from group b on the trochanter. 



Sections through the trochanters of adult dealated females of 

 C. pennsijlvanicus and through the front wings of adult females and 

 males of C. mela were made. The pores (figs. 17 to 22) fouinl in these 

 sections are like those already described for the females of Formica. 



To ascertain if the nerves running to the wings and the sense cells 

 in the stubs of the wings of old dealated female ants are present, the 

 thorax of a dealated female of Camponotus was cut transversely into 

 sections 25 microns thick. This female had been kept in captivity 

 eight months and had reared a small family. On account of the 

 broken conditions of the sections, nerves cannot be traced into the 

 stubs of the wings, but the thoracic ganglia give off branches, and 

 some of these run toward the bases of the wings. Pores and sense 

 cells are easily found in the stubs of the wings. The sense cells 

 appear to be normal in all respects. Figure 23, SC, represents a few 

 of them taken from one wing. It thus seems that the nerves and 

 sense cells do not degenerate, as do most of the muscles in the thorax 

 of a dealated female ant, but the organs in the bases of the wings 

 appear to function throughout the life of the ant. 



Text fig. 3 is a diagram representing a transverse-longitudinal view 

 of a small portion of the femur {F) and about two-thirds of the 

 trochanter {Tr) from the third leg of a female of Formica. Groups 

 Nos. 7, 8, 9, and h are shown as marked by these characters. The 

 anatomy of the leg and the innervation of these groups are also shown. 

 At this articulation the nerve (.V) runs near the centre of the leg and 

 nerve branches (NB) are given off which run to the groups of sense 

 cells (SC). The sense cells are so located that the muscles (M) are 

 not near them, and a trachea runs near each group of sense cells. 



Plate XI, fig. 25, and Plate XII, fig. 26, are semidiagrams repre- 

 senting the innervation of the groups of pores (marked 2, 3, 4, and 5) 

 as found in the wings of Formica. Each wing arises from a niche 

 {Nic) in the thorax. The hard chitin of the wing is represented by 

 solid black, the soft articular chitin of the wing by dots, and the hard 

 chitin of the thorax by broken lines. 



Sections through the wings and legs of pup® of the hornet {Vespula 

 maculata) and the muddobber {Sceliphron cementarius) were also 

 made. The pores of the hornet (figs. 27 to 32) are the largest ones 




316

[Apr., 



studied, and this insect is also the largest one examined. Tlie pore 

 apertures are actually visible in only four of the pores drawn (figs. 

 29 and 31). The pores of the muddobber (figs. 33 to 41) are the 

 second largest ones studied. Four pores (fig. 41) were found on the 

 thorax at the base of the niche of the front wing. 



All the pores of the ant, hornet, and muddobber described in the 

 preceding pages may be compared with a tyjiical pore (fig. 42) from

\'. Physiology of the Olfactory Pores. 



To a.scertain whether the pores, which have been studied, are 

 actually the organs in ants and hornets that receive odor stinmli, 

 the wings and legs of many individuals wore mutilated. The beiiavior 

 of these nuitilated insects was carefully .-studied and they were te-^ted 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 



with the various odors in the same manner as described on pages 

 297 to 305. 



1. Dedlated females of Formica. 



May 31, four dealated females and several workers were removed 

 from a small colony of Formica. They were placed into a Fielde 

 nest. Later the four females were put singly into experimental 

 cases and were tested with the six odors. Their reaction times are: 

 oil of peppermint 2-3 seconds, average 2.50 seconds; oil of thyme 

 2-3 seconds, average 2.25 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-3 seconds, 

 average 2.75 seconds; honey and coml) 2-5 seconds, average 3.25 

 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-4 seconds, average 3.00 

 seconds; formic acid 3-4 seconds,' average 3.50 seconds. These 

 give a general avefage of 2.89 seconds, while the same average for 

 winged females of the same species is 2.45 seconds. The wing 

 niches of the four dealated females were examined. In seven of the 

 eight niches, pores were seen. One of these females lived 38 days. 

 The other three and all the workers died Novemlier 25th. They had 

 been neglected and had not been given water for more than a week. 



2. Wings of females of Formica pulled off. 



All 4 wings of each of 25 virgin females of Formica were pulled off. 

 This is accomplished by pinning the ant to the board as described 

 on page 307. Seize awing with the thumb and index-finger and pull 

 gently with the wing .standing at right angles to the thorax. A half- 

 hour after the wings had been pulled off, these wingless females were 

 tested with the six odors. In behavior they appeared normal in 

 every respect except they responded to odors slightly more slowly. 

 Confined in a Fielde nest alone, they lived from 4 to 16 days with 

 10 clays as an average, whereas their winged sisters lived 14 days 

 and 10 hours as an average. Their reaction times are: oil of pepper- 

 mint 2-4 seconds, average 2.20 seconds; oil of thyme 2-3 seconds, 

 average 2.44 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-4 seconds, average 2.32 

 seconds; honey and comb 3-6 seconds, average 3.84 seconds; leaves 

 and stems of pennyroyal 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seconds; formic 

 acid 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seconds. These give a general average 

 of 2.85 seconds, while the same average for sister females with wings 

 is 2.45. All the wings of these 25 females were examined micro- 

 scopically after they had been pulled off. Of the front wings 14 

 carried pores and 36 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings 24 

 carried pores and 26 were devoid of pores. Thus when tested with 




318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



odors these ants carried jiores on only G2 per cent, of the bases of 

 their wings. Might not the dift'erence of 0.40 second in reaction 

 time between the reaction time of these wingless ants and that of 

 the winged sisters be due to tiie fact that the pores on 38 per cent, 

 of the wings were prevented from functioning? 



To ascertain if a greater percentage of wings including the jjores 

 could l)c pulled off artificially, the wings of 37 more winged females 

 were pulled off. This time greater care in pulling off the wings was 

 taken. These wings were also examined microscopically. Counting 

 all the wings from both lots of ants, G2 ants in all, 50 per cent, of the 

 wings pulled off bore pores. Of the front wings ])ulle(l off .52 bore 

 pores and 72 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings pulled off 

 72 liore pores anrl 52 were devoid of pores. 



To ascertain the percentage of wings including the i)ores actually 

 lost by the natural method, many detached wings from the virgin 

 fcMuales were removed from the large glass cage. These wings were 

 certainly shed in the same manner in which the wings of female ants 

 are shed in nature. The worker ants had carried great numbers of 

 these detached wings out of the ne.st and had laid them on the 

 refuse pile. Of the 786 detached wings of females examined micro- 

 scopically only 18 per cent, of them bore {)ores. Of the front wings 

 120 bore pores and 365 did not bear pores. Of the hind wings 21 

 bore pores and 280 did not carry pores. Thus one-third of the front 

 wings bore pores, while only one-thirteenth of the hind wings bore 

 them. As stated on page 311, the average number of pores for both 

 front wings of one of these females is 320, and the average number 

 of i)ores for both hind wings of the same female is !)8. With these 

 females it is, therefore, evident that when the wings are shed only 

 21 per cent, of the pores as an average arc lost, while 79 jier cent, 

 are not prevented from functioning, l)ecause the wings devoid of 

 pores always break off at a weak place (text fig. 1 and Plate XI, fig. 

 25, XX, yij) in the chitin just distal to the grou])s of i)ores. The 

 wound made by the wing i)reaking off at this ]>hicc cannot affect the 

 sense cells in the least because a thick layer of cliitin separates the.se 

 cells from the outside air. 



One of the virgin females wiiich had recently sheil her wings, was 

 examined. .Ml four of the bases of the wings of this female were 

 left intact. 



3. ]r/«</.s ()/ iiiahs of Formica pulled off. 



The wings of 7 males of Formica were pulled off and the nnitilated 

 males were tested with odors as usual. They aiiiicared normal in 



J 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 



every respect except they responded more slowly to odors than thev 

 did before the wings were pulled off. Confined in a Fielde ne.t 

 with several sister workers, they lived from 3 to 9 days, with an 

 average of 5 days. Their reaction times are: oil of peppermint 2-5 

 seconds, average 3 14 seconds; oil of thjine 2-5 seconds, average 

 3.00 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-A seconds, average 2.86 seconds- 

 honey and comb 3-10 seconds, average 4.86 seconds; leaves and 

 stems of pennyroyal, 2-5 seconds, average 3.71 seconds; formic acid 

 3-5 seconds, average 3.43 seconds. These give a general average 

 of 3.O0 seconds, whereas the same average for the same ants before 

 the wmgs were pulled off is 2.63 seconds. The detached wings of 

 these 7 males and those from other brother ants were examined 

 microscopically. Of the 56 detached wings examined, 87§ per cent 

 bore^pores. Of the front wings 29 bore pores and one' had no ^L 

 Of the hmd wings 20 bore pores and 6 had no pores. On page 331 

 It IS stated that the average number of pores for both front wings o

4. Bases of icings glued and legs of females of Formica covered with 



vaseline. 



With a small pencil brush the bases of all 4 wings of each of 25 

 winged females of Formica were covered vnih liquid glue. When 

 he glue was dry another small pencil brush was employed in covering 

 the surface of each leg with a vaseline-beeswax mixture. Since 

 yellow commercial vaseline spreads too much when used alone a 

 mixture was made by using three parts of vaseline and one part' of 



thTnSxtur; ''^'*' °^ *''' ''^ '''''^'' '^'' '""'"^ '''''' "'"''''^ ^'th 

 As soon as this double operation was completed, the ant was put 

 mto an experimental case. When unpinned from the board the ant 

 was as active as usual and when placed inside the experimental case 

 It was slightly more restless than ordinarily. Confined singly thev 



'^ZlTr *'r ^^'u' '™" *'^ ""^-■^' '^^^t they begin at once to 

 Clean off the vaseline-beeswax mixture. They pulled the front legs 




320 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



between the mandibles and licked them with the mouth parts. 

 Then they rubbed the front legs on the other two pairs and again 

 put the front legs to the mouth parts. Sometimes they also stand 

 still and stroke the antennae with the front legs. As a result of all 

 these cleaning processes, they smear the vaseline-beeswax mixture 

 over the greater part of the body and some of it covers the spiracles. 

 Except for the slight restlessness caused by the double operation 

 and for the slowness in responding to odors, they appeared normal 

 in all other respects. They lived from 1 to .5 days, with 3 days as 

 an average. Their deaths were probably due to the vaseline- 

 beeswax mixture being spread over the spiracles. Their responses 

 to odors were similar to those of intact ants, but more often than 

 with immutilated ants they vibrated one or more legs. The reaction 

 times are: oil of peppermint 3-12 seconds, average 5.16 seconds; 

 oil of thyme 3-10 seconds, average 4.48 seconds; oil of wintergreen 

 3-10 seconds, average 4.56 seconds; honey and comb 4-25 seconds, 

 average 6.32 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 3-10 seconds, 

 average 4.92 seconds; formic acid 3-15 seconds, average 5.80 seconds. 

 These give a general average of 5.21 seconds, which is slightly more 

 than twice the same average for unmutilated sister females. May 

 not this slow reaction time be attributed to the fact that manj- of 

 the pores were prevented from functioning? 



5. Dedlated females of Camponotus. 



During May and June, 1913, 26 deiilated females of Camponotus 

 were caught in the woods, either with colonics or just b(>ginning to 

 found colonies. When brought to the lal)oratory they were put into 

 Fielde nests and queen cages as already described on page 296. 

 Twenty-five of these females were placed singly into the experimental 

 eases. Each one soon became cjuiet. and then it was testeil with the 

 six odors. Their responses were similar to those already described 

 for unmutilated workers of the same species. The reaction times are: 

 oil of peppermint 2-3 seconds, average 2.24 secontls; oil of thyme 

 2-4 seconds, average 2.28 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-3 seconds, 

 average 2.44 seconds: honey and comb 3-20 seconds, average 6.00 

 seconds; leaves and stems of permyroyal 2—4 seconds, average 3.00 

 seconds; formic acid 2-12 seconds, average 3.52 seconds. These 

 give a general average of 3.25 seconds. The longi-vity of these 

 females cannot be given. Only 4 of tho.se confined in queen cages 

 have died up to the time of this writing, May 20, 1914. Tiiese 

 4 lived from 3 to 56 days. Not a single one kept in the Fielde 

 nests has vet died.

6. Glue in wing niches and legs of dedlated females of Camponotus 

 covered with vaseline. 



During October the 22 remaining live dealated females of Cam- 

 ponotus were tested with the six odors after the niches from which 

 their wings arise had been filled with liquid glue and the legs had 

 been covered with the vaseline-beeswax mixture. When put into 

 the experimental cases they were as quiet as before they were thus 

 mutilated and seemingly removed but little of the vaseline. They 

 appeared normal in all respects except that they responded to odors 

 more slowly than they did before the glue and vaseline were used. 

 The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 3-15 seconds, average 

 5.64 seconds; oil of thyme 3-15 seconds, average 6.32 seconds; oil 

 of wintergreen 3-10 seconds, average 5.14 seconds; honey and comb 

 3-60 seconds, average 19.00 seconds; five times they failed to respond 

 to the honey odor when the vial was held under them for 60 seconds ; 

 leaves and stems of pennyroyal 4-15 seconds, average 6.32 seconds; 

 formic acid 3-10 seconds, average 5.23 seconds. These give a 

 general average of 7.94 seconds, which is more than twice the reac- 

 tion time obtained by using the same ants before glue was put into 

 the wing niches and vaseline was put on the legs. At the present 

 writing (May 20, 1914) the longevity of these mutilated females 

 cannot be given, for as yet only 5 of them have died. These 5 lived 

 from 7 to 44 days. After being tested, each female was returned 

 to her own nest or cage. Those put back into Fielde nests were at 

 first accepted hostilely by their offspring. This hostility was probably 

 due to the presence of the glue and vaseline. All of those that had 

 workers were sooner or later cleaned, and thus they became normal 

 again. Four of the five that died had no workers and the vaseline 

 spread over the greater portion of the ant's body. Cannot the slow 

 reaction time obtained by using the mutilated females be attributed 

 to the fact that many of the pores were prevented from receiving 

 odor stimuli on account of these pores being covered with glue and 

 vaseline? 



7. Wings of males of Camponotus pulled off. 



The wings of 25 males of Camponotus were pulled off. Usually 

 a small drop of blood exuded f ram the wound when a wing was pulled 

 off. They were quite restful and were easily tested. They appeared 

 normal in all respects except that they responded to odors more 

 slowly than did their brothers with intact wings. The reaction 

 times are: oil of peppermint 2-5 seconds, average 2.72 seconds; oil 




322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



of thyme 2-4 seconds, average 2.88 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-5 

 seconds, average 3.12 seconds; honey and comb 3-10 seconds, average 

 4.56 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-6 seconds, average 

 3.64 seconds; formic acid 3-7 seconds, average 4.00 seconds. The.se 

 give a general average of 3.49 seconds, which is one and a fourth times 

 the reaction time of unmutilated males. These mutilated males 

 lived from 1 to 24 days, with 7 days and 2 hours as an average. 



The detached wings of these males were examined microscopically. 

 Of the front wings pulled off 45 bore pores and 5 were devoid of 

 pores. Of the hind wings pulled off 4 had pores and 9 were devoid 

 of pores. As stated, the average number of pores for the front 

 wings of the males of this species is 595 and for the liintl wings the 

 average number of pores is 173. It is, therefore, evident that 88 

 per cent, of the pores belonging to the wings were prevented from 

 functioning. May not this fact be used to explain (lie slow reaction 

 time of these wingless males? 



8. Wings of Vespida niacuUila pulled off. 



The wings of 21 workers of Vcspiila mnculaUi were pulled off. 

 Only occasionally did a small drop of blood exude from the w(nnuls. 

 When placed into the experimental cases, they were as restless as 

 were their sister winged hornets and they appeared normal in all 

 respects except that they responded more slowlj' to odors than did 

 the ones with wings. They lived in .these cases from 2 days to 

 6 days and 12 hours, with 4 days, and 8 hours as an average. The 

 reaction times are: oil of peppermint 3 20 seconds, average 6.57 

 seconds; oil of thyme 3-15 seconds, average 6.19 seconds; oil of 

 wintergreen 3-15 seconds, average 6.29 seconds. These give a general 

 average of 6.35 seconds, which is almost three times the same average 

 for sister hornets with the wings intact. 



The detached wings of these mutilated hornets were examined 

 microscopically. Of the front wings pulled off 29 l)ore pores and 

 13 were devoid of pores. Of thf hind wings pulled off 41 bore pores 

 and 1 was devoid of pores. As stated, the average luunber of 

 pores for the front wings of these hornets is 1,036 and the average 

 number of jiores for the hind wings is 4i8. It is, therefore, evident 

 that 78 i)er cent, of the pores belonging to the wings were pre- 

 vented from functioning. May not this fact again be used to 

 explain the slow reaction time of these wingless hornets?

9. Summary. 



From the preceding pages it is seen that probably not more than 

 21 per cent, of the pores on the wings of female ants are lost at the 

 time the wings are shed and that the remaining 79 per cent, of the 

 pores are not prevented from functioning because the wings break 

 off at a weak place (text fig. 1 and Plate XI, fig. 25, xx, yy) in the 

 chitin just distal to the groups of pores. The wound caused by the 

 wings breaking ofT cannot affect the sense cells connected with the 

 pores, because a heavy layer of chitin separates them from the external 

 air. Sections through the thorax of an old dealated female ant show 

 that most of the muscles in the thorax have degenerated, but the nerves 

 running to the wings are still present and the pores iii the stulis of the 

 wings are still connected with sense cells. This indicates that the 

 sense organs in the stubs of the wings function throughout the life 

 of the ant. 



All of the results obtained in the experiments on normal and 

 mutilated insects are summarized in the following table. To make 

 the table complete for Hymenoptera and for comparison, the data 

 from the writer's former paper concerning the worker honey bee are 

 appended. The "three odors" used are those from oil of pepper- 

 mint, oil of thyme, and oil of wintergreen. The "six odors" used 

 are those from oil of peppermint, oil of thyme, oil of wintergreen, 

 honey and comb, leaves and stems of pennyroyal, and formic acid. 

 It will be noted that when the antennse of any of the insects listed 

 in the table are mutilated, the insects are abnormal in behavior; 

 but when the pores on the legs and wings are covered, the insects 

 are normal in beha\'ior. The reaction times obtained by using 

 insects with mutilated antennae are slower than those obtained when 

 unmutilated individuals are used, bvit it is quite possible that the 

 slower reaction times are caused by the aljnormal liehavior of the 

 insects and are not due to the theory that some of the olfactory 

 organs are prevented from functioning. When the wings' are pulled 

 off artificially, al)out three-fourths of the pores on these appendages 

 are lost and the reaction times are slightly slower. When the pores 

 on the legs and wings are covered, the reaction times are more than 

 doubled, while in the honey bee the reaction time is increased twelve 

 times. It was impossible to prevent the ants from removing most 

 of the vaseline from the legs.

B. DISPOSITION OF THE OLFACTORY PORES OF OTHER 

 HYMENOPTERA. 



In making a comparative study of tlie olfactory pores of Hymenop- 

 tera, 29 species representing 22 families have been used (those of 

 ants and hornets already described included). Since the pores of 

 only one specimen for each species were counted, the total number 

 of pores recorded certainly cannot be a fair average. Besides this 

 error, there is also a probable error of not less than 10 per cent, on an 

 average for all the specimens. In the smaller individuals, particu- 

 larly ants, the probable error is perhaps not more than 2 or 3 per 

 cent., but in the larger specimens, . especially the hairy ones, this 

 error is perhaps more than 10 per cent. The pores on only the wings 

 and legs have been included in the total numbers. On all the stings 

 examined, pores have been found. The mouth parts of a few of the 

 specimens were hurriedly examined; all of them bear pores. A few 

 antennae were also hurriedly examined. None of the pores first 

 described by Hicks were found on these appendages, but this can be 

 definitely decided only after a critical study of the antennte has been 

 completed. No pores were found on the petiole or other parts of 

 the ant not already named. 



I. Distribution. 



Since all the variations relative to distribution are slight, only 

 the most important ones will be mentioned. In all the species 

 having two segments in the trochanter, the groups of pores ordi- 

 narily found on the femur occur on the second segment of the tro- 

 chanter. Sometimes groups Nos. 1 and 2 on the front wing are 

 united. At other times group No. 2 is almost divided into two 

 separate groups. The groups of pores are usually located in areas 

 devoid of hairs, but occasionally the groups are closely bordered by 

 hairs. Sometimes a group is surrounded by clear chitin caused 

 by the group lying in an area of thin chitin. In short, the distri- 

 bution of pores of those species placed below the ants in the scheme 

 of classification is similar to the distribution of the pores in ants; 

 the distribution of those species placed above the ants in the scheme 

 of classification is more like to the distribution of pores in the 

 honey bee. 



II. Number. 



In regard to the number of groups and the total number of pores 

 found in the different species, the variations are great. Cinibex, 




326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



regarded as the lowest hymenopteron, has the leaf^t numlDer of 

 groups of all the species examined, but it stands fourth in regard to 

 the number of isolated pores. Its total number of pores is larger 

 than those of many of the higher forms. Among ants the variations 

 are also great. For the legs of ants the number of pores varies from 

 211 to 356 and for the winged ants the total number varies from 

 463 to 1,090. The smallest specimen among the ants and the seconil 

 smallest one of all the Hyraenoptera examined is a female with 463 

 pores as the lowest number. The drone honey bee with 2.608 pores 

 has the highest number. The smallest specimen examined is a wasp 

 with 688 pores. (For further details see table, p. 332.) ' 



III. Relative Sensitiveness of Species Examined to Odors. 



It was impossible to obtain a sufficient number of live insects of 

 each species examined so that their relative .sensitiveness to odors 

 could be experimentally determined. If such had been possible, 

 the reaction times obtained would probably not represent the true 

 relative sensitiveness better than the method described below, 

 becau.se the reaction times depend not only upon the ability to 

 receive odors, but also upon the agility and sluggishness of the 

 insects used. Using only the grand total number of pores of each 

 species examined (see tal)le, pp. 330 to 334) a.s a l)asis, it is also impos- 

 sil)le to ascertain the relative sensitiveness because the numbers are 

 too variable. Moreover, it ma>' be generally said that the smaller 

 the species the fewer and proportionately larger are the pores. 



The method adopted for determining the relative sensitivene.ss to 

 odors is: (1) determine the relative sizes of the prepared insects; 

 (2) divide the total area of cytoplasm exposed to the air in all the 

 pores of a given insect by the total area of cytoplasm exposed to the 

 air in all the pores of ^ficro(|ask'r, used as a standard; (3) divide the 

 quotient obtained in (,2) by the relative size of the given insect. 

 The number resulting by this division is called the relative sensi- 

 tiveness of the given insect. 



Since it seems reasonal)le that as a general rule the sizes of two 

 hymenopterous insects are proportional to the respective diameters 

 of their femurs at the extreme i)r()ximal ends, tlie fciinir of the hind 

 leg of each prepared specimen was measured with the aid of a camera 

 lucida. The.se mea.surements may be called the relative sizes of the 

 insects and the diameter of the extreme proximal end of the femur 

 belonging to Microgastcr maj' be calleil 1.00, as a standard i>y which 

 to calculate the diameters of the other femurs. It wa.s thus ascer- 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



tained that the relative sizes of a few of the specimens were less 

 than 1.00, while most of them were greater than 1.00. 



A study of the anatomy of the pores shows that the diameters 

 of the peripheral sense fibers are proportional to the diameters of 

 the flasks. Of course, the greater the diameters of the peripheral 

 sense fibers, the more cytoplasm is exposed to the external air. The 

 diameters of the ends of the sense fibers cannot be measured, but 

 the diameters of the flasks can be accurately measured. To facilitate 

 matters, the largest pore on the femur of the leg measured and the 

 largest one on the front wing of each individual insect were draw^l 

 with the aid of a camera lucida. Figures 43 to 79 represent these 

 pores. The larger pore in each case is from the femur and the 

 smaller one is from the front wing. For our purpose each pore may 

 be regarded as a circle having for its diameter the shorter diameter 

 of the pore as shown in the drawings. To obtain the relative sensi- 

 tiveness of all the pores on the legs of a given insect, the diameter 

 of the largest pore on the femur, the total number of pores on the 

 legs and the relative size of the given insect were used. To obtain 

 the relative sensitiveness of all the pores on the legs and wings 

 combined, the diameters of both pores, the grand total number of 

 pores, and the relative size of the given insect were used. 



By this system of calculating it was determined that Cimhex with 

 its 1,216 pores smells 0.87 times as well as Microgaster which has 

 only 622 pores, and only 0.85 times as well as the smallest ant with 

 463 pores. In speaking of the relative sensitiveness obtained by 

 this system of calculating, a large probable error must always be 

 allowed and the figures only approximately represent the truth. 

 Allo^ving for the probable error, all the winged individuals, except 

 three, placed between Cimhex and Ceropales in the table seem to 

 have the olfactory sense about equally developed. The three 

 exceptions are the ichneumon-fly (Megarhyssa), the female ant of 

 Ayhaenogaster, and the male ant of Camponotus, all three of which 

 seem to smell slightly better than the others. The males of Campo- 

 notus probably smell slightly better than the females of the same 

 genus and considerably better than the winged forms of Formica. 

 The small workers of Camponotus seem to smell slightly better than 

 their large sisters and considerably better than the large workers 

 of Formica and of C. mela. According to the reaction times obtained 

 in determining the relative sensitiveness to odors of ants, the males 

 of Camponotus receive odor stimuli considerably better than the 

 workers and females of the same genus, but about as well as do the 




328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



winged forms of Formica. The quicker reaction time of Formica is 

 probably due to the fact that Formica is more agile than Camponotus. 

 Based on reaction times, the small workers of Camponotus smell 

 slightly better than their large sisters. Judging from the total 

 number of pores, the winged forms of any species of ants smell 

 considerably better than the workers of the same species. 



Among the wasps the relative sensitiveness is tolerably well 

 graduated from the lowest to the highest species as listed in the 

 table. Instead of the two social wasps, PoUstes and Vespula, having 

 the highest relative sensitiveness, they seem to take second place, 

 while the first place is held by the guest wa.sp, Psemlomasaris, and 

 the solitary wasp, Monobia. 



Among the bees the relative sensitiveness is also tolerably well 

 graduated from Andrena, the lowest examined, to Apis, the highest. 

 This system of calculating shows that the worker honey bee smells 

 considerably better than the queen and equally as well as the drone. 

 Reaction times show that drones smell slightly better than workers 

 and consiilerably better than queens. It is thus seen that the honey 

 bee has the most highly developed olfactory sense of the Hymenop- 

 tera, while that of ants is considerably inferior. 



Based upon reaction times, the relative sensitiveness to odors of 

 insects depends not only upon their aVnlity to receive odor stimuli, 

 but also upon their agility and sluggishness in responding when the 

 olfactory organs are stimulated. To illustrate this point, the 

 workers of Camponotusi are more agile than the workers of Apis, and 

 for this rea.son probably alone they respond more quickly to odors. 

 Judging from only their reaction times, the former smell better than 

 the latter, but in all probability the reverse is the truth. The ability 

 to receive odor stimuli depends upon the development of the entire 

 nervous system, including the olfactory apparatus, and upon the 

 physiological state of the in.sect being tested. .\t the mating time 

 the winged females of ants ceitainly smell as well and ]irobably much 

 better than the workers of the same species. As long a.s the recently 

 fertilized females perform all duties necessary in bringing their first 

 brood to maturity, they certainly retain almost the same degree of 

 acuteness in smelling a.s before; but when they become a mere egg- 

 laying machine and jierform none of the nest duties, their ability to 

 receive odor stimuli is probably less acute. It is thus seen that the 

 physiological state is an important factor when the relative sensi- 

 tiveness is considered, and we have little means of knowing just 

 what physiological condition a given insect is in when it is being 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 329 



tested. To decide definitely about the relative sensitiveness to 

 odors of insects, it is, therefore, necessary to consider (1) the degree 

 of agility or sluggishness in responding when stimulated; (2) the 

 degree of development of the entire nervous system, including the 

 olfactory apparatus; and (3) the physiological state or condition 

 in which the insects are in when being tested.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



[Apr. 



In regard to the location of the olfactory organs in insects several 

 views have been held. Lehmann (1799) tries to analogize the 

 spiracles of insects with the noses of vertebrates. Comparetti 

 (1800) places the scat of smell in different parts for different families 

 as follows: The club of the antenna; in lamellicorn beetles, the 

 proboscis in Lepido])tera and certain frontal cells in Orthoptera. 

 Ramdohr (1811) mistakes the Salivary glands in the head for the 

 olfactory apparatus. Rosenthal (181 1) regards a folded skin beneath 

 the antennffi as the seat of the olfactory organs. Huber (1814) 

 considers the mouth cavity of the honey bee as the seat of olfaction. 

 Treviranus (1816) thinks that the oesophagus is the seat of the 

 olfactorj' apparatus. Kirby and Spence (1826) regard the rhinarium 

 or nostril-piece as the seat of the organs of smell. Burmcister 

 (1836) considers that insects smell with what he calls the "internal 

 superior surface." Paasch (1873) claims tliat a i)late between the 

 eyes and beneath the antennae is the seat of the olfactory organs. 

 Wolff (1875) calls the hairlike organs on the epipharynx of the honey 

 bee the olfactory a])iiara1us. Joseph (1877) claims to have found 

 an olfactory region near the spiracles wliich communicates with tlie 

 trachea;. 



.\ftcr having cut off the antenna; of two male moths, Dugds (1838) 

 says that the insects were unable to find a female that they had 

 previously been al)le to locate while their antennae were intact. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



Blow-flies with the antennae cut off fail to find putrid meat as 

 before. 



Lefebvre (1838) experimented with bees and wasps with mutilated 

 antennae. He thinks that the olfactory organs are located at the 

 extremities of the antennae. 



Perris (1850) says: (1) In amputating the extremity of the 

 antennae the olfactory sense is not destroyed, but it is weakened, and 

 by cutting them off at the base the sense of smell is totally or par- 

 tially destroyed; (2) covering the antennae with a layer of india 

 rubber renders these organs insensible; (3) sometimes a little sensi- 

 bility is shown when the palpi are amputated. 



Cornalia (1856) experimented with mutilated male moths. He 

 thinks that the seat of olfaction lies in both the antennse and palpi. 



Garnier (1860) denies that the antennae of Necrophagus are the 

 seat of the olfactory organs, because these beetles returned imme- 

 diately to the body of a mole from which they had been removed. 



Balbiani (1866) says that male butterflies with the antennae cut 

 off fail to respond, as do unmutilated males, to females in any manner. 



Grimm (1869) after many experiments concludes that the antennae 

 of beetles do not function as olfactory organs. 



Forel (1874, 1885) says that ants when deprived of their antennae 

 cannot guide themselves and are not able to distinguish companions 

 from enemies or to discover food placed at their sides. When 

 deprived of the anterior part of the head and of the entire abdomen 

 they preserve all their faculties. The same author (1878) found that 

 a wasp with the anterior part of the head cut off responded to a needle 

 dipped in honey, while a wasp with both antennte cut ofl: failed to 

 respond. Forel (1908) says that carrion-feeding beetles with the 

 antennae cut off cannot find putrid meat as before the antennae are 

 mutilated. 



Hauser (1880) studied the behavior of various insects before and 

 after the removal of the antennae. When the antennae were cut off, 

 many individuals soon became sick and died, although some of them 

 lived thereafter for many days. In insects with their antennae 

 dipped into melted paraffin, the behavior was similar to that of those 

 with the antennae amputated. After performing many expermients 

 with Philonthus ceneus, he concludes that these insects lose the 

 olfactory sense by the removal of the antennae. Experiments with 

 species of several other genera gave the same results, but those with 

 beetles of the genera Carabus, Melolonlha, and Silpha were less 

 satisfactory. These never completely failed to respond to strong- 

 smelling substances. Experiments with Hetniptera gave a still less 




336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



favorable result. After the loss of the antennae, these insects reacted 

 almost as well as they did with their antennae intact. 



Porter '(1883) thinks that the antennae of butterflies and some 

 other insects have nothing to do with olfaction. Some insects are 

 affected little, if at all, by the extirpation of the antennae, while 

 others become very sick after the loss of these appendages. 



Graber (1885) contends that ants {Formica rufa) and flies (Lxicilm 

 ccesar) and beetles (Silpha thoracica) without their antennae still 

 possess the sense of smell. He is inclined to the view that insects 

 do not^have any special olfactory organ, and that when the odorifer- 

 ous emanations are intense they may be perceived by the surfaces 

 of the body whidi are covered with thin chit in and which are provided 

 with terminal excitable nerves. 



Plateau (1886) says that in Blatta the antennae are the olfactory 

 organs. Graber (1887) repeated Plateau's experiments by using 

 many cockroaches, and declares that in these insects the antennae 

 actually function as olfactory organs, but this is nut true for all 

 insects. 



Fielde (1901, 1903, 1907) claims that the eleventh or distal segment 

 of the antennae of ants perceives the nest odor; the tenth segment, 

 the colony odor; the ninth segment, the individual track; the eighth 

 and seventh, the inert young; and the sixtli and fifth, the odor of 

 enemies. Miss Fielde clipped the antennae with sharp scissors, and 

 15 days after the operation about 40 per cent, of the ants recovered 

 from the effect of the shock. "Before their recovery the ants were 

 listless and abnormally irritable; and they attacked with self- 

 destructive violence any moving thing that touched them." She 

 also found that queen ants deprived of their antennic did not iwiiave 

 normally. 



Parrows (1907) says that gum on the antennie of Drosophila 

 anipclophiln does not keep out odors, nor could tiie antenna' l)e 

 burnt off without considerable injury to the flies. He etherized some 

 flies and cut off the terminal segment bearing sense cones with fine 

 scissors, and he declares that the etiier did nf)t affect the resiilts of the 

 experiments witli odors. He says: "It therefore seems certain 

 that the sense of smell is absent, or at least greatly reduced in flies 

 that have lost the terminal joints of the antenna\" 



Kellogg (1907) informs us that male silkworm moths with extir- 

 pate(l antennic are unable to finil the females unless by accident. 



From the foregoing it is seen that about one-fourth of all the 

 writers who have experimented on insects with mutilated antennae 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 



assert that these appendages do not carry the olfactory organs. 

 Most of the observers have failed to state whether or not the insects 

 used were normal. The inactivity of most of their insects indicates 

 abnormality. With Miss Fielde's ants, only 40 per cent, recovered 

 from the effect of the shock, and in all probability all of these were 

 more or less abnormal. The writer has found that when the antennae 

 of ants, wasps, and bees are mutilated in the slightest degree the 

 insects are always more or less abnormal in behavior. 



Hicks (1857, 1859, 1860) first discovered the organs called the 

 olfactory pores in this paper on the halteres and on the bases of the 

 wings of all Dtptera examined; on the bases of all four wings of the 

 four-winged tribes; on the trochanter and femur of all insects, and 

 occasionally on the tibia. He examined many species representing 

 various insect orders and found these pores even on the lower insects, 

 such as the earwig. In such wingless insects as the worker and 

 soldier ants, he infers that these pores are much more abundant on 

 the legs than they are on these appendages in the winged insects. 

 Hicks suggested an olfactory function for all of these pores, whether 

 on the legs or wings, but he performed no experiments of any kind. 

 His drawings represent only the superficial appearance of the pores. 



Janet (1904, 1907) found porelike sense organs in large numbers 

 in all the ants that he examined. They occur on the mouth parts, 

 legs, and he saw a few on the thorax at the base of the wing of a queen 

 ant. His drawings of the superficial aspects of all these pores are 

 very similar to those seen by the writer, but he has failed to under- 

 stand the internal anatomy. He calls the chitinous cone an umbel, 

 which is always separated from the surrounding chitin by a chamber. 

 The chamber communicates with the exterior by means of a pore. 

 The sense fiber, or his manubrium, runs into the umbel, and he 

 thinks that it spreads out over the inner surface of the umbel and 

 does not open into the chamber. Thus the umbel forms a thin 

 layer of chitin which separates the end of the sense fiber from the 

 external air. 



In conclusion, it seems that the organs called the olfactory pores 

 in this paper are the true olfactory apparatus in Hymenoptera and 

 that the antennae play no part in receiving odor stimuli.

DESCRIPTION OF A NEW BLENNY FROM NEW JERSEY, WITH NOTES ON 

 OTHER FISHES FROM THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. 



BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



During 1912 and the past year, a number of local collections have 

 been acquired by the Academy. Many afford new or interesting 

 localities, which are grouped according to the several States. Though 

 multitudes of the commoner species were examined at the fisheries, 

 usually small collections ami small .specimens were obtained where 

 possible. 



New Jersey. 



Dasyatis say (I-e Sufur). 



Exumincd a large one on the beach at Corson's Inlet, June 20, 1913. 

 At this localitj' on June 19 saw Fundulus heteroclitus jnacrolepidotus, 

 PoroHotnn triacnnthufi, Cijno.'^cion regalin, Chilomyderux schapfi, and 

 Lophius piscatorius. On June 20 and 21, saw Anguilla chrisypa, 

 Fundulus heteroclitus macrolepidotus, Fistularia tabacaria, Hippo- 

 campus hudsonius, Cynnscion regnlis, BairdieUa chrysuru, Sci(enops 

 ocellatus, Menticirrhus saxatilis, Pogonias cromis, Monacanthus hispi- 

 dus, and Paralichthys dentatus. The Fistularia was preserved, having 

 been taken in the summer of 1912, and was about 15 inches long. 



Several selachians have been reported to me on apparently trust- 

 worthy authority. They are: 

 Alopias vulpes. 



One 1() feet long, taken in the jiounds at Sea Isle City in May, 

 1900. T. Kiipfer. 

 Scoliodon terrae-noTS. 



One about 3 feet long, examined by Mr. W. J. Fox, was para- 

 sitized with numerous female copepods [I'dndnrus siniuitus), which 

 were preserved. This shark was secured May 31, 1913, and the 

 fishermen reported several more shortly afterward. 

 Sqnatina squatina. 



One reported at Ocean City on December 31, 1912, and another in 

 the same month at Stone Harbor, credited with being four feet long. 

 Sorosoma cepedianum i I.c Suour). 



Dr. !{. J. Phillips secured an adult at Corson's Inlet, October 16, 

 1913, taken in a mullet-net. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 343 



Synodus foetens (Linnaeusi. 



One received from Dr. Phillip.'^, taken in the summer of 1912, at 

 Corson's Inlet, with Atopichthys, Gasterosteu-s acideatus, and Lagodon 

 rhomboides. Mr. D. ^IcCadden secured an example at Ocean City 

 on September 17, 1912. 



Felichthys marinus (Mitchill). 



An adult from Corson's Inlet, secured on August 19, 1912, by 

 Air. Fox. 

 Tylosurus marinus (Walbaum). 



Many examples, about ten inches long, obtained by Mr. McCadden, 

 on August 11, 1912, at Ocean City. August 30, 1913, at the same 

 locality, he obtained a young Prionotus ei'olans slrigatus, and found 

 Seriola zonata abundant. 



Tylosurus raphidoma (Ranzaiii). 



Dr. Phillips secured a large example on August 15, 1913, taken in 

 the pounds at Sea Isle City. Several other examples were also 

 taken. The species appears to be frequent off our coast in the 

 svmimer. 

 Sphyraena borealis De Kay. 



A small one was secured in the bay at Corson's Inlet, on August 

 2, 1913, by Dr. Phillips. 

 Trichiurus lepturus Linnajus. 



Mr. Fox reported one at Sea Isle City on July 5, 1912, and another 

 on July 16, which last contained numerous small whitish eggs. A 

 third example was taken in Great Egg Harbor Bay at Ocean City, 

 July 30, 1913, and notice sent to me by Mr. W. B. Davis. 



Caranx hippos (Linnaeus). 



A small example was obtained at Corson's Inlet on Septemljer 7, 

 1913, and another a little larger on September 8, by Dr. Phillips. 

 Rachycentron oanadus (LinnsBus). 



Air. Fox secured an example, 30 inches long, at Sea Isle City, 

 on August 12, 1912. 

 Orthopristis chrysopterus (Linnaeus). 



Five small ones were caught at Corson's Inlet on September 20, 

 1913, and forwarded by Dr. Phillips. When caught, they grunted. 



Sciaenops OOeUatUS (Linnaeus). 



Dr. Phillips secured a small one at Corson's Inlet on September 

 8, 1913, and about the same time Air. AlcCadden got a large one at 

 Ocean City. Both these specimens were infested with lerneans.

Type, No. 39,440, A. N. S. P. Sea Isle City, Cape May County, 

 New Jersey. September 5, 1913. Edward Nolan Fox. 



Only the type kno^\Ti. It was secured in a little slough formed 

 about the pilings of the pier, and left by the tides. The specimen 

 was alive when found, swimming actively about, though it died shortly 

 after its capture, when confined in a small vessel. 



The species falls within the subgenus Blennius Linnseus. It is 

 related to Blennius J ucorum Valenciennes, though that species has a 

 smaller and obtuse head, its orbital cirrus bifid at tip and fringed at 




MQ PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., 



its base, more teeth (24 in each jaw), and a different coloration. 

 It is said to be olivaceous, spotted with brown, and the spinous 

 dorsal edged with paler. De Kay figures an example secured between 

 New York and Constantinople, and it is therefore uncertain if he 

 really obtained it in our limits. 



Blennius stearnsi Jordan and Gilbert also differs in the coloration, 

 more slender body, longer maxillary, and more numerous teeth 

 (24 to 26). 



(Named for Master Edward Nolan Fox, who secured the type.) 



Urophycis regius (Walbaum). 



Air. AlcCadden secured one in Great Egg Harl)or Bay, at Ocean 

 City, on July 6, 1913, with Bairdiella chrysura, and a large prawn 

 {Peneus seliferus). The Bairdiella was infested with a lernean 

 parasite. On July 20, he found several more examples of Urophycis. 



TJrophyois tenuis (Mitchiin. 



A small example in the; Academy was obtained many years ago 

 at Cape May. This is the first I have seen. 



On Alay 26, 1912, I visited the Dutch Neck Fishery, between 

 Florence and Burlington, on the Delaware River shores, and found 

 Abramis crysoleucas, Ameiurus nebulosus, Fundulus heteroditus 

 macrolepidotus, F. diaphanus, and Eupomotis gibbosns abundant. 

 On June 1, 1913, I found Poniolobus pseudoharengus, Anguilla cliris- 

 ypa, Catosiomus commersonnii, Abramis, Schilbeodes gyrinus, F. 

 heteroditus macrolepidotus, F. diaphanus, Apdtes quadracus, Eupomo- 

 tis, and Boleosoma nigrum olmstedi. 



Air. J. T. Nichols informs me he found an example of Lobotes 

 surinamensis on September 20, 1913 at Galilee (Seabright), N. J. 

 Scomber colias, Pdamys alleterata, and Chwtodipterus faber were also 

 noted at the same time. Another Lobotes, with a large example of 

 Fistularia tabacaria, was also forwarded from .\nglesea, X. J., 

 October 21, 1913, through Mr. W. J. Fox.

During the spring of 1912, and again in 1913, a great number of 

 fishes were studied at Lovett's Fishery, situuteil at the mouth of 

 TuUytown Creek on the Delaware Hiver. A small spring-fed stn.ain,

also flowing into the river close below this point, was thoroughly 

 explore.l and yielded interesting material. Though unnamed, tl 

 here referred to as "TuIlyto\vn Brook " 



In June, 1912, 1 visited Mr. F. J. Meyers at Bethlehem, in North- 

 ampton County, and made a number of collections from the streams 

 flowmg mto the Lehigh River in that vicinity. Mr. Meyers agaTn 

 invited me to join him in this region in late Mav of 191.3, when we 

 al^so made a few more collections. We then continued this excursion 

 to Pocono Smnmit and explored various streams in Monroe County. 



M . R. W. Wehrle sent several collections from Indiana and 

 Huntingdon Counties. 



In late July I spent a week in. the lower Susquehanna region 



Mr'n I'tTT' '^ ^"' ''°""^-^'' '''' ^^-'^^'he assistance o/ 

 Mr. H. L. Mather, Jr., secured several interesting collections. 



\anous other collections of lesser interest, though some quite 

 extensive, have also been received during the past two years.

A young bluish example, taken in the shad-net at Tullytown. 

 lampetra aepytera (Abbott). 



Mr. Wehrle sent three small ones, though mature, from Hoffman's 

 Run m Indiana County. He writes: "There were a lot of them 

 sticking to stones m the riffles, and I think they were spawning. When 

 scared down stream they remained quiet a while, but soon returned 

 to stick to the same stones.." Two others were also received from 

 him, taken m Brick Pond. All taken in April, 1913.

In a collection of fish-bones from a kingfisher's nest, taken May 

 20, 1913, at Bustleton, sent to me by Mr. R. F. Miller, I did not 

 find the remains of this fish, as in a previous nest I reported. It

 to be pale or whitish, besides being silvery tinted. ^Vhen opened 

 it contained a large cestode measuring i530 nnn. in length. The 

 parasite was submitted to Dr. .1. P. Moore, who kindly informs me 

 that it is the larval stage of Dibothrium liyuhi Donnadieu. He says 

 it also occurs, in the larval form, in many birds, and in the mature 

 stage, in fish-eating birds. The parasite was wouncl in several 

 coils loo.sely tlu-ough the liver and about the aiidominal cavity.

FISHES COLLECTED BY THE PEARY BELIEF EXPEDITION OF 1899. 

 BY HENRY W. FOWLER. 



Mr. C. F. Silvester kindly placed this collection of fishes in my 

 hands for determination. In some cases the specimens represent 

 localities not given by previous writers. Two species are apparently 

 new. The collection is small, though fairly representative of the 

 meagre fish-fauna of such high latitudes in Greenland. At present 

 it is contained in the Museum of Princeton University, with the 

 exception of a series of duplicates presented to the Academy. The 

 writer is indebted to Princeton University and to Mr. Silvester, for 

 assistance and favors in framing the report.

fleshy, front edge free. Upper and lower buccal membranes well 

 developed. Nostrils near together, anterior in slight cutaneous 

 tube, and posterior simple pore with simple cutaneous rim. In 

 position anterior nostril about opposite middle of eye and posterior 

 about opposite upper rim of eye. Interorbital broad and slightly 

 convex. 



Gill-opening high, mostly above upper level of eye, and small, 

 its aperture not more than half of eye. Downwards and below to 

 disk skin forms slight fold. 



Skin perfectly smooth and without any conspicuous or evident 

 pores, also without spines. 



Dorsals separated by a deep notch, though their fleshy bases at 

 least continuous. First dorsal smaller and more rounded than 

 second, edge also slightly notched and of quite fleshy texture. Its 

 insertion about over front of gill-opening. Second dorsal with 

 rays more free or defined, though simple, and more uniform. Anal 

 like second dorsal. Caudal moderate, rounded. Pectoral moderate, 

 with long and moderately inclined base and composed of simple 

 rays. Pectoral extends as far posteriorly as disk. Latter quite 

 large, circular, and not ensheathed anteriorly by lower pectoral 

 rays. Edge of disk entire. Vent close behind disk. 



Color in alcohol largely pale brownish, fins paler or more or less 

 whitish. Under a lens, head and trunk almost everywhere finely 

 dotted with minute specks of darker shade. They also completely 

 cover first dorsal, together with upper and lower regions of pectoral. 

 On posterior ventral region darker dots quite sparse or inconspicuous. 

 Iris pale slaty. 



Length 21 mm. 



Type, No. 2,950, Museum of Princeton University. Though the 

 precise locality in Greenland is lost, Mr. Silvester thinks the specimen 

 was probably taken in Ulriks Bay. 



Only the type known. It is very similar to Lcthotrennis jnuticus 

 Gilbert, from the Aleutian Islands, differing in the narrow notch 

 between the dorsal fins, fewer dorsal rays, larger vertical fins, larger 

 ventral disk, uniformly dotted coloration, etc. It agrees, however, 

 in the smooth skin and dorsal spines. Gilbert gives the eye as 

 very large, 2^ to 2\ in head, though his figure indicates that at the 

 very least it is 4. His largest example was 30 nun. long.-

MONTANA SHELLS. 



BY E. G. VANATTA. 



Mr. L. E. Daniels collected the following species of shells in the 

 Bitter Root Mountains, Montana: 

 Hemphillia danielsi n. sp. Figs. 1, 2. 



Animal sluglike, with the shell partly exposed, and the mantle 

 elevated into a visceral hump, as usual in this genus. The color 

 in formaline is yellowish-gray with bluish-black markings, but in 

 alcohol it is white with black maculations. The shell pore is about 

 § the length of the mantle. The posterior part of the foot is narrow, 

 with a dorsal median groove and a tail pore. The ovo-testis, fig. 2, 

 has a grayish color with black pigment where the ends of the follicles 



are in contact; albumen gland is yellow; thevas deferens is narrow, 

 enlarged near the uterus; epiphallus long, narrow, and coiled where 

 it joins the vas deferens, and at the insertion of the penis retractor 

 which is as usual attached to the retensor muscle; penis long, conical, 

 tapering towards the atrium, where there is a broad gland; penis 

 papilla short and conical; spermatheca globular on a broad duct 

 which is attached to the body wall in its lower part. Length 34 mm. 

 Types in the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences 110,052, 

 from Camas Creek in the Bitter Root ^Mountains, Montana, collected 

 by Mr. L. E. Daniels, in whose honor I take pleasure in naming 

 the species. Another specunen used to figure the external form is 

 from Medicine Hot Springs, ]\Iont.

This species differs from H. camelus P. and V. by liaving a caudal 

 mucous pore, a narrow tail, and the penis is narrower, with a gland 

 at the base. The mantle is papillose like H. glandulosa B. and B., 

 but it does not have the "horn" on the tail.

ON THE ORTHOPTERA FOUND ON THE FLORIDA KEYS AND IN EXTREME 

 SOUTHERN FLORIDA. II. 



BY JAMES A. G. REHN AND MORGAN HEBARD. 



During the month of July, 1912, the authors undertook a careful 

 field examination of the Florida Keys and the adjacent mainland in 

 order to complete their studies in the Orthoptera of the subtropical 

 area of southern Florida. Material procured by field work under- 

 taken by the junior author in January and February, 1903 and 1904, 

 and in INIarch, 1910, as well as small collections made at Miami 

 during the summer of 1903 and at that locality and Key West in 

 November, 1911, have already been studied.' The supplementary 

 results obtained from the present collection, when compared mth 

 the material of the two previous papers noted alcove, afford a very 

 complete knowledge of all but the scarcest species of the Orthoptera 

 of this region. A number of species of tropical origin are there so 

 scarce and so difficult to find that our knowledge of them is based 

 on the single or very few specimens taken; such species can only 

 be fully studied by a resident or through definite search for these 

 forms alone. We feel satisfied, however, that the present paper 

 gives the final results of a very careful general examination of the 

 region under consideration. 



The recent summer work indicates several important facts. The 

 families Mantidae, Acrididse, and Tettigoniidse are shouni to be 

 severely affected in winter by the cold, the Acrididse the least of the 

 three families. Almost all of the fairly plentiful or abundant species 

 are to be found in greatly increased numbers in the summer, but the 

 scarce or very rare species are in the great majority of cases quite as 

 difficult to find in the summer as during the winter. Certain species, 

 particularly some of those belonging to the Acrididse and Tetti- 

 goniidse, which are numerous or very abundant during the summer, 

 are wholly absent in the winter. The following table- will indicate 

 the comparative abundance of forms as found in midsummer.

- This table should be compared with that ah'eady fjiven (Proc. Ac.\d. N.\t. 

 Sci. Phila., 1912, p. 235) which .shows the comparative abundance of forms a.i 

 found just before the appearance of the spring forms.

The number of specimens taken on the trip of July, 1912, is 

 seventeen hundred and seventy-five (there are seventeen hundred 

 and eighty specimens recorded in this paper) and eighty-nine species 

 are represented. Of these species three are new, while one circum- 

 tropical species is recorded from the United States for the first time 

 and the definite establishment of five tropical species within the 

 United States is fir.st demonstrated. 



Besides the eighty-nine species discussed in tlie present paper, we 

 have alreadj' recorded from this region the following species:

Relative Value of Tropical Element. 



In this region the truly troiiical element is shown l)y the following 

 species : 



Prolabia arachidis (Yersin). *Mantoida maya S. & Z. 



Ischnopfera rufescens (Beauy.). *Aplopus mayeri Caudell. 



Neohlattella detersa (Walk.). *Stilpnochlora marginella (Serv.). 



Supella supellectilium (Sery.). *OUyacanthopus prograptusR. &'ii. 

 *Ceratinoptera diaphana (Fabr.). (hyllodes sigiUatus (Walk.). 



Leurolestes pallida (Brunn.). *Cyrtoxipha gundlachi Sauss. 



Blaberus atropos (StoU). *Orocharis saulcyi^iGuenn). 



Holocompsa nitidula (Fabr.). *Tafalisca lurida Walk. 

 *Plectoptera poeyi (Sauss.). 



The species preceded by an asterisk appear to be the only forms 

 which haye not been accidentally introduced by man. Three of 

 these nine species are known only from the keys, five from the keys 

 and the jungle-like "hammock" land of the subtropical region of 

 Florida, and one from the latter only. This evidence shows that 

 half of the tropical species which have become permanently fixed 

 in this region were, in all probability, accidentally introduced by man, 




376 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



and that outside of these species the tropical element is very weak, 

 equalling but 11.3% of the non-introduced species, and only found 

 in the scrub of the keys and the limited areas of jungle-like "ham- 

 mock" land on the southernmost portion of the Florida peninsula, 

 distinguished particularly by the presence of the gumbo limbo 

 {Bursera simarubra). Of these species the genus Mantoida is tropical 

 American, while Oligacanthopus is known onlj^ from a single specimen 

 from Miami, Fla. All of the other species are West Indian, Plec- 

 toptera poeyi, Stilpnochlora viarginella, and Cyrtoxipha gundlachi 

 being found elsewhere in tropical America as well. One species, 

 Paratettix toltecus (Sauss.), taken at Homestead, Fla., only, alone 

 represents a purely Sonoran and ^Mexican form. 



The following species are tropical intruders in the Lower Austral 

 zone of the southeastern United States which are foimd in the region 

 under discussion: 



Anisolabis annulipes (H. Lucas). Pycnoscelus surinamensis (Linn.). 

 PeripJanela australasire (Fabr.). *Scap(eri.'<cns nhhreriahis Sc. 

 Periplaneta hrunnea (Burm.). *Cryptoptilum antillarum (Redt.). 



The species preceded by an asterisk again appear to be the only 

 forms in this list which have not been accidentally introduced by 

 man. The species Pycnoscelus surinamensis shows, however, very 

 long residence in this region by its widespread abundance. 



Pine trees are found only on Big Pine and the adjacent keys, and 



in the undergro^rth of these forests three species, Radinotatum 



brevipenne peninsulare, Sckistocercn damnifica ccdidior, and Aptenopedes 



aptera, were found, which species were not present elsewhere on the 



keys. In this situation the resemblance of sjiecimens of a number 



of species to mainland individuals of the same was closer than to 



those taken in the keys scrub, the latter .series as a rule differing in 



paler coloration.

Key West, Fla., July 5, 7, 1912; 3 cT, 2 9 . 



The femoral annuli are prominent in all of these specimens, one 

 female from Key West having these markings jjarticularly heavy. 



The specimen from Homestead was taken from under a boaid in a 

 yard. The series from Key West was taken chiefly from under 

 coquina l)oulders about the East Martello tower, while one specimen 

 was captured between boards in the wood shed where Blaherus 

 alropos was found numerous.

Anisolabis maritima (Gen6). 



Key West, Fla., July 5, 1912; 4 cf , 5 Q , 1 n. 



This species was found, as in the winter, swarming under coquina 

 boulders and drift on the beach. Individuals have almost always 

 been found in the proximity of salt water. 

 Labidura bidens (Olivier). 



Key West, Fla., July 7, 1912; 1 cf', 1 9 . 



One of these specimens was taken moving actively across a coquina 

 road after dark. At that hour, with the aid of a flash-lamp, this species 

 was seen in numbers near piles of coquina and about dwellings near the 

 beach. This insect is freciuently found with the preceding species. 

 Labia minor (Linn.).'' 



Key West, Fla., July 7, 1912; 1 9 . 



This specimen, the first record of this cosmopolitan species from 

 Florida, was found between boards in the wood shed where the 

 series of Blaberus atropos was taken. 



Prolabia nnidentata (Beauv.). 



Homestead, Fla., July 10, 1912; 1 cT, 1 9 . 



These two individuals, both lacking wings, were taken under the 

 bark of a dead pine log in the pine woods, where in like situations 

 the species is occasionally fouml throughout the year in this region, 

 though seldom in large numbers. 



Prolabia araohidis (Yersin). 



1876. Labia brunnea Scudder, Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hi.st., XVIII, p. 264. 



Homestead, Fla., July 10-12, 1912; 7 cf , 13 9 , 3 n. 



This cosmopolitan species was found rather numerous in the greasy 

 kitchen of the boarding house at Homestead. After dark the 

 insects would appear in numbers accompanied by swarms of Peri- 

 planeta americana, but the series was secured with difficulty, as the 

 insects were very active and invariably scuttled away into cracks 

 in the walls and tables at the first approach of a light. Imlividuals 

 were greasy and unclean. 



Caudell^ has recently placed Scudder's Labia bninnea correctl^v in 

 the synonymy under the present species. 



Though this species has been found introduced in the United 



■• The species, Labia curvicauda, which was found so plentiful in March, 1910, 

 on Long Key, was not .seen in the summer of 1912. Peeuliar conditions following 

 the hurricane of 1909 afforded the opportunity to take the series on the earlier 

 date, and had dying toi)s of cocoanut palms been present in the summer of 1912 

 there is little doubt but that the species would have been then found abundant.

At Homestead the species was found under boards lying on very 

 wet ground in the prairie-like everglades, while at Detroit and Key 

 West the specimens were taken in debris and leaf mold in heavy 

 jungle-like areas of trees, bushes, and vines. The species had not 

 been previously taken on the keys. 

 Ischnoptera uhleriana fulvescens S. and Z. 



Homestead, Fla., July 10-12, 1912; 2 cf, 1 9. 



The remains of the above recorded males and an additional speci- 

 men of the same sex were found entangled in the webs of spiders 

 at the railroad station, where they had probably been attracted by 

 the lights. 

 Ischnoptera rufescens (Beauv.). 



{Ischnoptera blattoides of authors.) 



Key West, Fla., July 4, 1912; 1 d^. 



This individual, the first United States record of this circumtropical 

 species, was taken in a very greasy cupboard in the Hotel Jefferson 

 in company with swarms of BlatleUa germanica and a few spooimens 

 of Supella supellectilhun. The much paler coloration made this 

 specimen, the only one of the species seen, very conspicuous among 

 the many other darker roaches disclosed by the light of a flash-lamp. 



We follow Saussure in i)lacing this species in the genus Ischnoptera. 

 It is the only species of that genus found within the United States 

 which has the ventro-cephalic margin of the cephalic femora armed 

 with a complete row of spines, the more distal shorter than the more 

 proximal. All of the other NoHh American species of Ischnoptera 

 have this margin armed with .3 to r> strong spines succeeded distad 

 by a close-set row of mimite piliform spinulations.

One specimen of this circuratropical species was taken in a fruit

 Hotel Jefferson in the rooms and kitchen cupboards. The males 

 occasionally appeared in lighted rooms running about with extreme 

 rapidity and often taking flight. The females were all taken in 

 cupboards where Blattella germanica was found in swarms.

The series was taken in a fruit store where the species was common 

 in a pile of old burlap bags and in cracks under the stands which it 

 sharetl with one fairly large colony of Blattella germanica, occasional 

 specimens of Holocompsa nitidida, a few specimens of Periplaneta 

 americana, and one specimen of SiipeUa siipeUectilium. The present 

 species was previously known from the United States from a single 

 female taken on Key Largo, Fla. 



A single female was captured which had just moulted into the 

 adult condition, this specimen v/as uniform pale straw color. 

 Nymphs of this species are above bay in coloration, Ijelow more 

 tawny, especially on the limljs, while that portion of the head from 

 the interantennal space to the clypeal suture is very dark; the 

 entire dorsal surface of these nymphs is rough, much as are the 

 distal abdominal segments in nj-raphs of Pijcnoscelus surinamensis.

The single specimen from Detroit was found concealed in an

 "hammock" land. Two specimens were taken revealed by a 

 flash-lamp at night; an adult climbing on the trunk of a pine at 

 Homestead and a nymph climbing about in a clump of weeds over a 

 foot from the ground at Key West. It appears that this species 

 moves about at night, hiding under bark "of logs and in other recesses 

 during the day. Where pines were present individuals of this 

 species have almost invariably been found liidiug under the liark 

 of dead logs and stumps of this tree.

Adults of this species were found common, nymphs few, between 

 old boards in a wood shed; many nymphs but few adults were also 

 found under boards on the ground near by. This great insect is 

 widely distributed ami well known to the natives about Key West, 

 where it is found in wood piles, under boards and other refuse about 

 the town. The insects, when exposed, either remained motionless 

 or scuttled toward another place of concealment with no great speed. 

 The nymphs were usually found half buried in loose damp earth 

 under boards, where they remained motionless, looking much like 

 lumps of earth (with which they were usually much dusted) until 

 disturbed. Two very small nymjihs were observed which had 

 recently moulted, these individuals were pure white and very soft.

These diminutive roaches were found in the folds of burlap bags 

 under the counter of a fruit store where other interesting roaches 

 were taken, and also with Blaberus atropos between old boards in a 

 wood shed, where nymphs were more numerous than adults. The 

 insects when disturbed ran about with great speed, but did not go 

 far to hide, often stopping in the first bits of refuse to which they 

 came. This is the first time that Holocompsa nitidula has been found 

 established within the United States; the only previous record of 

 the species being fountl in this countrj- is that of Caudell,'- of a 

 single specimen found on cotton batting from the store room of the

 unquestionably accidentally introduced. 



Tlie present series enables us to synonyniize Burmeister's Holo- 

 conipsa cyanea, which was based upon males of the species, wliile his 

 Holocampsa collaris was described from individuals of the opposite 

 sex. The latter species was first recognizetl as a .synonym of Holo- 

 compsa nitidula by Kirby in 1904. '^ Previous authors have failed 

 to recognize cyanea and collaris as sexes of the same species owing, 

 apparently, to their lack of sufficient material. The males are 

 rather slender and almost uniformly shining blackish (the antenna 

 have three pale yellowish joints in the distal jiortion and the limbs 

 are very dark brown), while the females are much more robust, the 

 pronotum is strikingly cinnamon-rufous and the tegmina are a ver}- 

 dark metallic blue in the colored portion; in the latter sex somewhat 

 more than the distal half of the antennie is pale yellowish. Such 

 striking differences between the sexes explains their being described 

 as different species in the same paper.

On Big Pine Key the species was beaten from a fringe of tall 

 bushes growing on the edge of a mangrove swamp, where individuals 

 were scarce. The insects were found fairly common on Key West 

 in rather scattered bushes, particularly Ilex cassinc. One nymph 

 was also taken at night at the latter lot-ality, running about on the

Key West, Fla., July 3-7, 1912; 3 o", 4 9 , 9 n. 



The nymphal individuals are in four stages of development, the 

 most immature specimen having the body 8.25 millimeters in length, 

 the same measurement in the largest nymph being 39 mm. The 

 males show but little variation in size, all, ho.wever, equalling or 

 exceeding the maximum measurements given by Caudell for this 

 form.'^ The females show some size variation, the length of the 

 pronotum in all being slightly longer than Caudell's measurements, 

 although the tegminal length is under his maximum in all four 

 individuals. The coloration of both sexes shows no decidetl varia- 

 tions. Specimens from more northern localities in the range of the 

 species apparently average smaller than individuals from the keys, 

 judging from a male from Tarpon Springs, Fla., antl two females from 

 Fort George, Fla., and Thomasville, Ga. 



The present specimens were taken chiefly from gumbo-limbo trees 

 in the heavy key scrub jungle, but the species also occurred on sea 

 grape. The. insects were always on the trunks or branches and 

 generally about six feet from the ground, infrequently higher and 

 very rarely lower. They were perfectly protected when in their 

 resting position, being then closelj' pressed against the bark of the 

 tree. When disturbed they would make off with a rapid scuttling 

 run.

Homestead, Fla., July 10-12, 1912; 3 cf , 1 9 , 1 n. 



Detroit, Fla., July 12, 1912; 1 d', 4 n. 



On careful examination of our Florida series of twenty adults of 

 this genus, two species were found to be present, distinguishable by 

 very good characters in the male and female genitalia and also in the 

 distal abdominal segments. The original description and figure of 

 tenuescens show conclusively that the form with the elongate sub- 

 cylindrical anal segment in the male is that species. 



The two species of Manomera were taken together in tlie same 

 situations; on prairie, in undergrowth of pine woods, and at night on 

 the extremities of the leaves of the saw palmetto (Serenoa) at Home- 

 stead and in pine woods undergrowth on the edge of a hammock at 

 Detroit.

 abbreviate seventh, eighth, and ninth alwloniinal segments and the 

 form of the apex of the male abdomen. In the male the seventh, 

 eighth, and ninth dorsal abdominal segments together are hardly or

 they are half again as long; the eighth dorsal segment in hrnchypyga 

 is transverse insteael of longitudinal: the ninth segment fornicate

 i.s considerably longer than the seventh and eighth segments, while 

 in tenuescens it is less than the seventh and eighth segments in

The present authors have recorded a male of this species, taken 

 at San Pablo, Fla., August 13, 1905, as M. tenuescens, at that writing 

 not recognizing it as distinct from individuals of that species in tlie 

 same series. A series of one adult female and eleven nymphs taken 

 at Miami, Fla., March 28, 1910, have also been recortled as that 

 species. The above-measured five males and one female constitute 

 the kno\ra series of adult specimens of brachypjifia, the San Pablo 

 specimen showing that there is considerable variation in size, regaril- 

 ing which our series is too small for us to say whether it is geographical 

 or individual in character. We consider the two additional Home- 

 stead s])ecim('iis and the single Detroit individual, i)aratyi)es. Tiie 

 differential characters show almost no variation, there being but a 

 slight amount of jiroiwrtional difference in the length of the eighth 

 dorsal segment. The distal margin of the ninth ilorsJil abdominal 

 segment varies from arcuato-emarginate to obtuse-angulate emargi- 

 nate. In coloration the Homestead and Detroit individuals are 




191-4.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 387 



uniform, while the San Pablo specimen is of similar pattern but with 

 the tones paler. 



The new form was found on July 10-12, 1912, under exactly the 

 same conditions at Homestead and Detroit as was tenuescens, the 

 San Pablo specimen having been taken in the undergrowth of pine 

 woodS/

A special trip to secure specimens of this striking species was made 

 to Loggerhead Key, where, with the kind assistance of Dr. Alfred G. 

 Mayer, the Director of the Carnegie Marine Biological Laboratory, 

 we were able to secure the above interesting series. All were taken 

 from bushes of the bay cedar {Suriann maritima), to which, as shown 

 by Stockard in his paper on the habits of this species,"^ the species 

 is there restricted. The adult females show the marked color 

 variations spoken of by Stockard, while the males vary only in the 

 extent to which the greenish of the limbs tinges the thoracic segments; 



Our series shows the following extremes in the length of the body, 

 cf 83.-93. mm., 9 (exclusive of the oviscapt) 114.-127.5. The oviscapt 

 varies considerably in length individually, the exti-emes, which are 

 in .specimens of approximately the same general bulk, being 25.-29.5 

 mm. The Loggerhead Key nymphs represent three stages of 

 development. 



According to Dr. Mayer, the species occurs on Bird Key and Garden 

 Key, the other islands of the Tortugas group. On Long Key the 

 single very immature individual was beaten from heavy key scrub. 

 The nearly half-grown male from Key West was found in the after- 

 noon, climbing uji the trunk of a bush in a heavy tangle.

The larger series was taken in bare spots on semi-liaked marsh

 material, for the species was frecjuent but not al>untlant. All of 

 these specimens are decidedly rugose, the specimens from Homestead 

 recorded above as well as a few of those taken in 1910 in this region 

 are considerably less rugose. All of the specimens from southern 

 Florida before us are very uniform and dark in coloration, with the 

 exception of two of the Jewfish series which individuals have the 

 pronotum a lighter brown except on each side for a short distance 

 caudad of the humeral angles. The extremes of pronotal length in 

 the above series are: cf cf 11.7 to 13.3 mm.; 9 9 13.8 to 15.6 mm.

At Homestead the species was common on the prairie-Uke ever- 

 glades and also in the "pot holes" in the pine woods, but not as 

 numerous as in March, 1910. The specimen from Long Kej' was 

 beaten from tall grasses in an open depressed area where Mermiria

This is the first record for a species of the present genus from the

 rugosus, in bare spots on sun-baked marsh soil, where it was found 

 to be very scarce.

Big Pine Key, Fla., July 6, 1912; 30 cf, 6 9 , 5 cf n., 11 9 n. 



The extensile Homestead and Detroit series of this race are per- 

 fectly typical in character, the Big Pine Key representation also 

 having all the distinguishing features of peninsulare, although of 

 slightly smaller size. There is considerable individual variation 

 in size in all three lots, the extremes in length of body of each being 

 as follows: Homestead, d' 32.2-35.7, 9 42.3-46.7; Detroit, cf 33.3- 

 35.2, 9 45.2-48; Big Pine Key, d' 28.3-33, 9 37.3-40.8 mm. It will 

 be seen that the Big Pine Key maximum measurements no more than 

 touch the minimum of the other lots in the male sex and do not reach 

 the same in the female. The average of the Big Pine Key series is 

 very appreciably less than the maximum dimensions given for the 

 same lot. 



The Homestead series has the brown phase jjredominating, while 

 the Detroit and Big Pine Key lots have the green phase outnumbering 

 the brown in the male sex. 



At all three localities the form was found common in the low 

 undergrowth in the pine woods. The record from Big Pine Key is 

 the first for the genus on the keys. It is doubtless found on all the 




390 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



islands possessing stands of pine, and not elsewhere, as the distri- 

 bution of the forms of this genus is limited by this controlling factor. 



Mermiria intertexta Scudder.

Big Pine Key, Fla., July 6, 1912; 18 cf , 1 9,7 9 n. 



Long Key, Fla.. July 13, 1912; 7 cf, 3 9 . 



The present series has been compared with a male from Georgia, 

 which is one of Scudder's types. In size the present repre- 

 sentation shows no noteworthy difference except that the Long Key 

 females are slightly smaller than the other two of that sex. In color 

 the Homestead and Big Pine Key series are very similar, with the 

 pale base color showing no greenish except in the Big Pine Key 

 female. The Long Key series, on the other hand, has the pale base 

 color greenish-yellow in the males, subochraceous in the females. 

 The three individuals of the latter sex from Long Key have the 

 discoidal area of the tegmina more or less distinctly maculate, 

 superficially somewhat suggesting Bruner's M. inacuU'pennis. In 

 all of the Big Pine Key males the dark medio-longitudinal line is 

 present on the head and pronotum, indicated but incomplete in the 

 accompanying female, indicated more or less distinctly in all of the 

 Homestead males and entirelj' absent in the female, indicated on the 

 head and pronotum in four Long Key males, on the head and as a 

 lining on the pronotal carina in two males and all three females, and 

 present on the head and entirely absent from the jjronotum in one 

 male from the same locality. In two of the seven Big Pine Key 

 nymphs there is no indication of this line and in the others it is only 

 faintly marked. 



At Homestead the species was infrequent in high grasses near the 

 edge of the prairie-like everglade, on Long Key it was not uncommon 

 in places where high grasses grew in an ojien depressed area, wliilc 

 on Big Pine Key it was taken from low plants on the edge of a man- 

 grove swamp, where the males were not infrequent, the females 

 mostly immature and but two adults of that sex seen.

and Boot Key" are proljalDly individual in the main and not geo- 

 graphic. As there stated, however, south Florida material is always 

 larger than Thomasville, Ga., specimens, although occasionally 

 but slightly so. The Big Pine Key series is quite similar in general 

 size to the individuals previously measured from Boot Key and 

 Key Vaca, although a single female is distinctly larger and subequal 

 to the smallest of the Long Key females, while one Homestead male 

 is subequal in proportions to the maximum Long Key males. Ex- 

 tremes of the present Homestead and Big Pine Key series, as well 

 as the Key West female, show the following measurements in milli- 

 meters:

The material from the keys which have scrub cover (Key Biscayne, 

 Long Key, Key Vaca, Boot Key, and Key West) is all either uniformly 

 colored or of the strongly bicolored phase {i.e., dorsum solidly paler 

 than the lateral aspects), while that portion of the material from 

 pine woods (Miami, Homestead, Detroit, and Big Pine Key) contains 

 thirteen specimens distinctly lined wdth black on each side of the 

 median carina of the pronotum, in a number also distinctly punctulate 

 with dark lirownish on the tegmina. The single nymph from Detroit 

 and one of the four from Homestead have the blackish lineatioiLs on 

 the pronotum, showing that this coloration is fixed l^efore the adult 

 condition is reached. 



At Homestead the species was uncommon in the pine woods, 

 nymphs, however, Ijeing abiuidant, while the single nymph from 

 Detroit was in similar surroundings. In the pine woods on Big 

 Pine Key the species occurred in fair numbers, \yhile the Key West 

 female, all seen at that locality, was taken in the scrub.

None of the Big Pine Key series are in the green phase, although 

 five of the seven Key West females and both of the same sex from 

 Homestead are in that phase. The Garden Key specimen is pale 

 rufescent, but in structure normal for the species. 



At Homestead and on Big Pine Key the species occurred in the 

 undergrowth of pine woods, on Garden Key it was very common in 

 short grass growing in the enclosure of Fort Jefferson, on Long Key 

 it was secured in the depressed grassy area where Mermiria intertexta 

 was also taken, and on Key West it was scarce among green heritage 

 and grasses in scattered gumbo-limbo forest. At the latter localitj' 

 nymphs were numerous.

The range of this beautiful form is extended by the present records 

 from the vicinity of Miami to Key West. In size the Homestead 

 and Detroit series average rather large, but disj)lay a considerable 

 amount of individual variation among themselves, the Big Pine 

 Key series averages smaller and is much more uniform in size, while 

 the Key West series is quite large but individually variable. The

The Key West and Big Pine Key series are uniformly short-wingeil, 

 while the Homestead and Detroit representations have a far greater 

 proportion long-winged, abbreviate tegmina l^eing present in five 

 females and the same condition appro.ximated in two males. It is 

 probable that environment is the governing factor in regard to 

 tegminal and wing length in this form. 



All of the color phases known for this race are present in the series 

 in hand, the only lot very uniformly colored being the male series 

 from Key West, which are greenish with the usual postocular bars. 

 The females from Key West, however, show three different color 

 phases. 



At Key West this form was common in green heritage or grasses 

 in or near a gumbo limbo forest in company with Orphidella pelidna, 

 while on Big Pine Key it was taken in pine woods undergrowth.

Cruciform markings on the dorsum of the pronotum are more or 

 less noticeable in five specimens of the present series. The differ- 

 ences in coloration previously noted''* are found in the series before us. 



E.xamination of the material shows that Caudell's record of Arphia 

 sulphurea from Key West is incorrect, the specimens belonging 

 unquestionably to the present species. 



At the first three localities given above the species was scarce in 

 the low undergrowth of the pine woods, but at Key West it was well 

 distributed through the scrub and also in the open gumbo-limbo forest.

 series of this species before us. 



The only situation in whicli this species was found was on the 

 ground under bushes in high jungle gro^\'th of the keys, where a few 

 scattered individuals and one small colony was encountered. The 

 species was very difficult to capture as the brush was too heavy to 

 use a net and the insects flew up hurriedly. Their flight was observed 

 to be usually low and for short distances.

The species was found occasional at Big Pine Key on the edge of a 

 fringe of mangroves in tall bushes and low plants and not scarce 

 locally in the scrub on Key West. It was taken in the same situation 

 as Schistocerca obscura at both Detroit and Long Key, at whi<?h 

 places the latter species was the more numerous.

This series bears out still more clearlv the fact that the size and 




396 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



wing length in the present species is much less in southern Florida 

 individuals than in more northern specimens anil that this is par- 

 ticularlj' emphasized in individuals from the keys. A series of 

 fifteen male specimens from the outermost keys, Key West and the 

 Tortugas, give the following averages: Length of pronotum, 7.7 mm. 

 (7.1-8.4); length of tegmen, 34.9 (32.3-38.).^ The females bear out 

 these facts in like manner. 



In the series from Loggerhead Key, there are three males Remark- 

 able for the fact that the tegmina wholly lack maculations of any 

 kind, which gives the insects a very distinctive appearance. No 

 intermediates between this and the normal color phase were seen, 

 but no characters exist to separate the specimens from typical 

 mnericana, the difference being simply due to a loss of a portion of 

 the color pattern through recession. 



Though only occasional at the majority of localities, this species 

 was very common through the scrub on Key West and quite numerous 

 on Loggerhead Key in open spots where the sandy soil was covered 

 with beach plants, grasses, and prickly pear. •

of the stridulating vein, while in the other this cohjration is decided 

 only in spots, one proximad, one distad, and one immediately distad 

 of the stridulating vein. One male from Homestead is quite brown- 

 ish, two females from the same locality are dull straw colored or 

 washed with brownish, while two Detroit females are much tinged 

 on the pronotum and proximad on the tegmina with pale reddish- 

 brown. A half-grown nymph from Miami, Fla., taken March 28, 

 1910, gives us an idea of the condition of individuals of the species 

 at that time of year. 



At Homestead this species occurred locally on the prairie-like 

 everglades, where they were scarce in the daytime, but plentiful at 

 night, perched on the grasses, .stridulating fearlessly. Their note is 

 an indescribable buzz and click. The Detroit specimens were taken 

 in pine woods on the edge of a hammock, and on Big Pine Key the 

 species was beaten from green bushes in the pine woods. Two 

 specimens were found dead in spider-webs at the railroad station 

 at Homestead on July 10.

When compared with Texan material of this species, the present 

 series is seen to be identical, although the size is much greater than 

 in individuals from New Jersey, which, however, show no specific 

 differences from Texan topotypes. When careful examination of 

 all the available material has been made, it will probably be found 

 that the size regularly decreases northward. All of the males and 

 several of the females have much of the pronotum, pleura, and 

 proximal portion of the tegmina more or less ochraceous. Four of 

 the males have the blackish tympanal maculation decided. The 

 species was fairly common at Homestead, more numerous at night 

 than in the daytime, always in the pine woods and in or near large- 

 leaved small bushes of several species. When search was made for 

 them at night with the aid of a flash-lamp, they proved to be quite 

 shy, flying frec[uently before their exact location could be ascertained. 

 Two specimens were taken from spider-wel)s on the station building 

 at Homestead, July 10.

This striking and peculiar sjiecies was taken in hut one location 

 on Key West, and there it was found at night locally numerous but 

 hard to secure. Individuals were taken only on buttonwood {Coyio- 

 carpus ereda) on the two occasions on which the spot was visited. 

 All the specimens were stalked with flash-lamp by the aid of their 

 song, in consequence none but males being captured. Their note is 

 quite different from that of any of the other species of the family 

 found on the keys, being low and rasping, much like zrrrp-zrrr)), 

 zrrrp. On Long Key the nymphs were taken from buttonwood {Cono- 

 carpus ereda), which there grows on the edge of mangrove swamps. 



As the species was previously known only from the unique type, a 

 female, we have made some notes on the differences of that sex from 

 the original description.'^

 margins slightly arcuate but subregularly converging, tlistal extremity 

 narrow, arcuato-emarginate, styles articulate, slightly tapering, their 

 length not greater than the width of the distal extremity of the plate.

In size the present series shows but little variation. The two

 • A comparison of this interesting series, the largest known of any 

 single species of the genus, with a paratj-pic male from Punta Gorda, 

 kindlj^ presented to us by Mr. Davis, shows that while fully in accord 

 in all the important specific characters the Homestead series uni- 

 formly differs in having the fastigium shorter, though of similar 

 form, while the l)lack marking of the clypeal suture is pronounced 

 only in the brown phase and not always present in that condition. 

 One single green male shows indications of this sutural marking, but 

 in the others the face is unicolorous. The Marathon male has the 

 fastigium more as in the paratype than is true of the Homestead 

 specimens, but the apex is even there less elongate than in the Punta 

 Gorcla specimens, while the clypeal suture has no black. These 

 differences are probably environmental or geographic but hardlj^ 

 specific in character. 



In size there is considerable individual variation, the extremes of 

 the Homestead series presenting the measurements in millimeters 

 given below, with which are placed those of the Marathon male, 

 which apprecialily surpasses in fniild anv from the mainland, and 

 of the Punta Gorda paratype.

At Homestead the species was very common on scrub jialmetto 

 {Serenoa serndaia) in the pine woods, rarely on otlier i^lants (two on 

 sugar cane, one on a pine tree, and one on a low bush) and only found 

 at night, when their stridulations permitted stalking with a flash-

lamp. The song was faint and ceased on an approach of even as 

 much as twenty feet. However, they were easy to capture when 

 located, as they almost invariably made no attempt to escape, but 

 instead merely slipped down the palmetto leaf a few inches or around 

 to the other side and there flattened themselves out with caudal 

 limbs extended backward and cephalic limbs forward. When picked 

 up they would violently attempt to bite their captor, and if successful 

 could inflict a painful bite on a tender portion of the hand. Their 

 jaws are capable of cutting the tough palmetto leaves and in conse- 

 quence are very powerful. Their note is very low and consists of a 

 succession of sounds like zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip.

At Homestead two perfectly typical males of fusco-stn'atus were 

 taken in company with typical specimens of mexicniuis. of which we 

 are thoroughly convinced the former is merely the brown-color pha.se, 

 absolutely no structural differences being found on careful examina- 

 tion. The song of individuals in the different pha.ses was noted as 

 being the same, a krzzzzz-krzzzzz-krzzzzz, each preceded, when one 

 is near enough to detect it, by a- sharp buzz. Individuals were only 

 occasional in the pine woods at Homestead at night and exceedingly 

 shy, although permitting a. near approach until they ceased singing, 

 when, however, they would dart wildly away. At Jewfish many 

 were heard singing in high grasses, from which one was taken. .\11 

 the specimens from Key West were secured in the scrub jungle, both 

 in the daytime and at night, many nymphs Ixnng seen. 



As remarked above, two individuals from Homesteatl are in the 

 brown phase, all the others being in the green phase. The specimens 

 in the latter condition show considerable variation in the blackish 

 fastigial marking, this varying from the faintest possible median 

 indication to quite a broad solid liand crossing the entire fastigium.

After a careful examination of the present specimen, the types 

 of Conocephalus hoplomachus and of Conocephalus malivolans 

 Scudder, we are convinced that hoplomachus represents the female 

 of malivolans. The latter was based on a single male from 

 Cedar Keys, Fla., which remainefl unique until the very cUffei'ent 

 female was described by us as C. hoplomachus. At that time we 

 examined the description of malivolans, but the sexual differences 

 are so great that we could not recognize the female then in hand as 

 the other sex of Scudder's species. The pre.sent specimen enables 

 us to establish the above synonymy, agreeing as the individual does 

 exactly with the original description and clearly being the male sex 

 of the apparently very different hoplomachus. 



The present specimen was taken during the daytime from saw 

 grass growing in knee-high water on the edge of the everglades.

These specimens show that considerable color variation is present 

 in the species, and while in a certain measure geographic, it is chiefly 

 individual. The Homestead series is in general uniformly quite 

 dark, two males, however, being rather pale. The single Detroit 

 individual is pale, as are most of the Jewfish specimens, none of which 

 are as dark as the average Homestead representative. Big Pine 

 Key specimens vary greatly, several having an average degree of 

 marking, while three have the general color pale yellowish. Key 

 West representatives are of the usual pattern in the female sex, but 




408 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



the males are much paler with a weak pattern. The Loggerhead 

 Key series varies greatly in color, three adults and both of the n.ymphs 

 having the pattern more or less distinctly indicated on a pale base 

 color, while the other two adults are uniformly ochraceous without 

 markings. 



The specimens from the keys average slightly larger than the 

 individuals from the mainland, the Key West females having this 

 most apparent. 



At Homestead the species occurretl in potholes and in the prairie- 

 like everglades, at Jewfish it was common in grasses oh the eflge of 

 the everglades, on Key West it was not scarce in grassy tangles 

 scattered through the jungle scrub, while on Loggerhead Key it 

 freciuented grasses growing on open areas among the l)ay-cedar 

 thickets.

high, hurried, shrilling song of the species was to be heard on all

THE VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE FLORIDA ALLIGATOR, 

 BY ALBERT M. REESE. 



The account given by Bronn in his Thierreich is apparently the 

 only published description of the circulatory organs in the Croco- 

 dilia. This account, even when translated, is not very satisfactory, 

 especially because it contains no diagrams of the circulation. It 

 was, therefore, deemed worth while to work out the circulation in 

 the Florida alligator in order that we might have not only a written 

 description, but also a series of more or less accurate diagrams of 

 the veins and arteries. 



A number of departures from the description of Bronn were 

 found, some of which are noted below. 



Most of the work was done upon animals of about 30 inches 

 length, wliicli were obtained alive from the Arkansas Alligator Farm 

 at Hot Springs, Ark. 



The arteries were injected with a colored starch mass by inserting 

 a two-way cannula into the dorsal aorta. With the blood thus 

 forced into them from the arteries, the veins could, in most cases, 

 be traced witliout difficulty. 



In the diagrams the outlines of the more important organs are 

 accurately shown by dotted lines, and the relative diameters of the 

 blood-vessels are shown as accurately as possible liy the solid black 

 lines. 



The Heart. 



In the Crocodilia, as is well known, the heart is four-chambered 

 and has about the same general shape as in the higher vertebrates. 



The venous blood is emptied into a thin-walled sinus venosus on 

 the dorsal side of the heart by three large vessels and one small one. 

 The largest of these, the postcava, empties into the posterior side 

 of the sinus venosus and brings blood from the posterior regions of 

 the body; it is quite wide, but is exposed for a very short distance 

 between the liver and the heart. Two large hepatic veins empty 

 into the postcava so near the sinus venosus that they practically 

 have openings into the sinus, as is shown in a somewhat exaggerated 

 way in Plate XIII, fig. 1. Near the postcaval and hepatic openings 




414 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



is the distinct coronary vein, lying in a slight depression between 

 the right and left ventricles. 



From the anterior regions of the body the blood is brought back 

 through two fairly wide but very thin-walled precaval veins which 

 pass across the dorsal surface of the heart to enter the sinus venosus. 



The arterial blood is brought from the lungs by two wide, thin- 

 walled pulmonary veins, Plate XIII, fig. 4, v.p.d., v.p.s. They 

 leave the lungs somewhat caudad to their middle region, near the 

 point of entrance of the bronchii and the pulmonary arteries, pass 

 mediad in a direction almost at right angles to the long axis of the 

 body, and enter the left auricle at the same point. 



Blood leaves the heart through five large vessels: (1) the ]iul- 

 monary artery, (2) the two aortic arches, (3) the right subclavian. 

 (4) the primary carotid. 



The pulmonary leaves the small right ventricle as a single stem, 

 which soon branches into two arteries that pass cephalad and laterad 

 to the lungs, along with and clpse to the main bronchi. The other 

 arteries that carry blood into the systemic circulation are fused at 

 their base to form a sort of conus arteriosus which may be distended 

 in injected specimen until it is larger than the two ventricles together. 

 When opened this conus is found to contain two chambers that lead 

 into the left ventricle; the larger chamber gives origin to the right 

 systemic arch, the right subclavian, and the primary carotid; the 

 smaller chamber is the basal part of the left systemic arch. 



The two systemic vessels, fig. 4, Ao.s, Ao.d, pass, in the usual 

 manner, as two arches to the dorsal region, just posterior to the 

 ventricles, where they form the dorsal aorta in the manner to be 

 described in connection with the arterial system. 



The further course of the primary carotid and of the right sub- 

 clavian will also be described in connection with the arterial system. 



The auricles are very large in proportion to the ventricles, though 

 their relative sizes will, of course, vary with the amoimt of contained 

 blood. 



The Venqus Sy.stem. 



The Posterior Vena Cava and its Branches. 



The postcava, fig. 1, pc, a.s noted above, is a wide, thin-walled 

 vessel seen extending across the short space between the anterior 

 face of the right lobe of the liver and the sinus venosus. As was 

 also noted above, the hepatic veins, vh — at any rate that from the 

 left lobe of the liver — enter the postcava so close to the heart that 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 415 



they may lie considered to have one or more cHstinct openings into 

 the sinus venosus. Followed caudad, the postcava may be traced 

 through the large right lolie of the liver, from which it receives 

 several branches. Emerging from the posterior border of the liver, 

 it is seen to extend caudad, in the median line, as a rather incon- 

 spicuous vessel that receives blood from the reproductive organs 

 and the kidneys that lie close on either side of it. 



The hepatic portal vein, h, has the usual distril)ution for that 

 vessel. Entering the liver in the neighborhood of the bile duct, it 

 receives first {i.e., nearest the liver) a small branch from the pan- 

 creas, pv; near the pancreatic are one or two branches from the 

 stomach, g, and a branch from the 'spleen, sp. A short distance 

 caudad to these vessels are two or three mesenteric veins, m, leading 

 from the mesentery and small intestine. Gaudad to the mesen- 

 teries, the portal system may be seen as a vein of diminished caliber, 

 i, leading from the posterior part of the small intestine and from the 

 large intestine. 



The connection, mentioned by Bronn, Isetween the rectal ranch 

 of the portal vein and the caudal vein could not be demonstrated. 

 After entering the liver, the portal, of course, breaks up into capil- 

 laries, and the blood thus distributed is recollected by the cap- 

 illaries of the hepatic veins above mentioned. 



The internal epiga.stric veins, ep, are, perhaps, the most conspicuous 

 vessels of the postcaval system. When the ventral abdominal wall 

 of the animal is removed, they may be seen extending forward from 

 the pelvic region, on each side of the body, to enter the posterior 

 edge of the liver. The epigastric of the right side enters the large 

 or right lobe of the liver, where it breaks up into capillaries; the 

 left epigastric sends its main branch into the left lobe of the liver, 

 but also sends a branch over to enter the right lobe. 



Following the epigastrics caudad, they are seen to receive vessels 

 from nearly all parts of the posterior region of the body. The left 

 epigastric, which extends across the ventral side of the stomach, 

 receives from that organ four or five branches, g'; while the farther 

 removed right epigastric receives only one or two branches from the 

 stomach. Posterior to these gastric veins the epigastrics receive 

 one or more veins, b, from the body wall and skin. Posterior, 

 again, to the last-named, veins each epigastric receives, in the pelvic 

 region, a large vein, the iliac, il, which receives, in tiirn, a vein from 

 the pelvis, pi, and continues down the thigh and lower leg to the 

 foot as the femoral, f, the chief vein of the posterior appendage. 




416 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [^lav, 



After receiving small branches from the muscles of the thigh, the 

 femoral receives near the knee a small branch from the posterior 

 surface of the lower leg, fb, and a larger one, t, that leads from the 

 anterior surface of the lower leg and foot. 



The veins of the pes were so small, in the comparatively small 

 animals it was necessarj- to use, that their distribution could not 

 be determined with certainty, though they seemed to parallel very 

 closely their corresponding arteries to be described below. 



A short distance caudad to the iliac veins, each epigastric receives 

 one or two fairly large branches from the pelvic region, called by 

 Bronn the ischiadic veiiis, is. Caudad to the ischiadics and dorsal 

 to the cloaca, each epigastric is united with a short but wide renal 

 portal or renal advehente vein, rp, leading to the posterior border of 

 its respective kidney and receiving, on the way, a short branch 

 from the pelvic region, shown just cephalad to the references lines 

 rt and rp. 



Very close to its junction with the renal portals each epigastric 

 gives off a small branch which unites with its fellow of the opposite 

 side to form a median vein, rt, the rectal leading from the posterior 

 part of the large intestine. A very short distance caudal to these 

 last veins, in the region just dorsal to the anal opening, the epigas- 

 trics are formetl by the division of the caudal vein, cv, which, of 

 course, brings blood from the tail and is, on account of the large size 

 of that organ, of considerable caliber. 



The Anterior Vence Cavce and their Branches. 



The entrance of the precaval veins into the heart was mentioned 

 above; their branches, in order from the heart cephalad, will now 

 be described. Since the two jirecavne are alike, it will be necessary 

 to describe the branches of only one side of the body. After leaving 

 the heart, the precava may be traced forward, for a short distance, 

 at the side of the trachea and oesophagus, as a wide, thin-walled 

 trunk, fig. 2, vca. The first tributaries that It receives arc the 

 internal mannnary and vertebral veins, which join it at the hase of 

 the neck at almost the same place. 



The internal mammari/. fig. 2, im, is a rather small vein, bringing 

 blood from the ventral wall of the thorax. It may be followed 

 along the inner surface of the ribs, near the sternum, in company 

 with its corresponding artery. 



The vertebral nin, fig. 2, v, is also of small diameter and extends 

 to the dorsal body wall near the spinal column, from which region 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. • 417 



it. returns blood to the anterior vena cava; it i.s drawn too large in 

 the figure. 



Just cephalad to the vertel>ral and internal mammary, the internal 

 jugular, j, enter.? the precava. The internal jugular may be followed 

 directly forward, close to the side of the trachea and oesophagus, 

 from which it receives numerous branches. Near its point of entrance 

 to, or rather exit from, the skull, it anastomoses, by two or three 

 short branches, with the external jugular, ej, to be described later. 

 Its distribution in the cranial cavity could not be determined in the 

 available material. At the point of entry of the internal jugular 

 the precava passes laterad for a short distance and then divides into 

 two more or less equal branches, the above-mentioned external 

 jugular, ej, and the subclavian, s, of which the latter will first be 

 described. 



The subclavian, s, of course, returns blood from the regions of the 

 shoulder and arm. On reaching the body wall, where it might be 

 called the axillary, ax, it receives, on its posterior side, a large thoracic 

 vein, t, which returns blood from the thorax, shoulder, and skin. 

 The thoracic receives a Ijranch from the posterior surface of the 

 arm, which might be called the postbrachial, pb; this postbrachial 

 may be traced, as a rather small vessel, to the hand; at the elbow 

 it is connected, by one or more small branches, with the brachial. 



Just distal to the thoracic the axillary vein receives two fairly 

 large vessels, the subscapulars, sc, that return blood from the shoulder 

 and upper arm. After receiving the subscapulars, the axillary may 

 be followed into the upper arm as the brachial, br. As has been said, 

 the brachial and postbrachial anastomose near the elbow, and in this 

 region the former i-eceives a small vessel that extends parallel to it 

 from the manus. 



In the forearm the brachial may be called the radial, fig. 2, A, ra; 

 on the back of the manus the radial receives branches from the various 

 digits and from a rather complex plexus of vessels in the carpal 

 region. 



The external jugular, fig. 2, ej, after separating from the subclavian, 

 may be traced cephalad, close beneath the skin, to the base of the 

 skull, where it is connected with the internal jugular by short 

 branches, as has already been noted. It receives several small 

 branches from the skin and muscles of the neck and shoulder 

 regions. At the region of its anastomosis with the'internal jugular 

 it receives a large branch, the muscular, ms, from the massive muscle 

 at the angle of the jaw and from the skin of that region. 




418 PROCKEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Maj-^, 



A short distance cephalad to the muscular the external jugular 

 receives, on its mesial side, two or three branches from the trachea, 

 larynx, and oesophagus, tr. Anterior to these vessels the external 

 jugular is formed by the union of two chief veins, the Unjual, 1. from 

 the ventro-lateral surface of the tongue, aud the inferior dental, id, 

 from the mesial surface of the lower jaw. The connection of the 

 superior dsntal (extending along the bases of the maxillary teeth) 

 with the jugular could not be determined with certainty, hence 

 that vessel is not shown in the figure. The same is true of the 

 small veins in the region of the cranium. 



The Arterial System. 

 The Abdomiiud Aorta and its Branches. 



The right and left aortic arches, fig. 3, Ao.d, Ao.s, arising from 

 the heart in the manner already described, form a rather long loop 

 and approach each other in the middorsal line. Here they are 

 united by a short, wide connective in such a way that the left arch 

 seems continued into the cceliac artery and the right into the ilorsal 

 aorta proper. Each arch, anterior to the connective, gives off two 

 fairly large branches, oe, to the posterior region of the cesophagus. 



The cceliac artery, fig. 3, c, is the largest branch of the alxlonainal 

 aortic system. After giving off a couple of small branches, oe, to 

 the posterior region of the oesophagus, it gives off a large spleno- 

 intedinal artery, si, to the spleen and small intestine. 



The coeliac then breaks up into thre.e arteries of about the same 

 size: the gastro-hepatico-intestinal, ghi, carrying blood to the stomach, 

 liver, and small intestine; the pancreo-intestinal, pi, leading to the 

 pancreas and small intestine; and the (jastric, ga, to the greater 

 part of the stomach. 



From the dorsal aorta proper, da, which, as has been said, seems 

 to be the direct continuation of the right aortic arch, several arteries 

 are given off; these will be de-cribed a'^ they occur in an anterio- 

 posterior direction. 



At about the point of union of the two aortic arches arises the 

 most anterior of .seven or eight pairs of lumbar arteric's, lu 1-7; 

 this finst lumbar artery is continued cephalad for some distance as a 

 longitutlinal trunk that gives off several lateral branches to the 

 walls of the thoracic region. The other six or .seven lumliars are 

 distributed to the dorsal body wall, and arise, at more or less regular 

 intervals, as far caudad as the sacrum, or even back of that point. 



The first large branch of the aorta is the unpaired mesenteric 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 419 



artery, m', which is given oE in about the region of the fourth pair 

 of lumbars; it carries blood through tlie mesentery to the greater 

 part of the small intestine and also sends a small branch to the 

 large intestine. 



Posterior to the mesenteric, the aorta gives off four or five pairs 

 of short arteries, the urogenitals, u 1-4, that lead to the nearby 

 reproductive organs and kidneys. 



About the middle region of the kidneys, a short distance anterior 

 to the sacrum, is given off a pair of rather large arteries, called by 

 Bronn the iscliiadicce, is'; each ischiadica, after giving off a couple 

 of small branches to the back, passes laterad and divides into three 

 main branches: (P) to the ventral body wall, (3') to the anterior 

 border and deeper region of the thigh, and (2') to the pelvis. 



In the region of the sacrum is given oK a pair of iliac arteries, 11^ 

 Each iliac is of about the same diameter as the ischiadica and gives 

 off, soon after leaving the aorta, an artery, ab, that apparently leads 

 chiefly to the abdominal muscles. Distal to the origin of the abdomi- 

 nal, the iliac gives off a small pelvic artery, pa, which leads, as the 

 name would indicate, to the pelvis. The iliac then passes into the 

 thigh, where it gives off several large branches and may be called 

 the sciatic, sc. At the knee the sciatic gives off two rather small 

 branches, one, the fibular artery, f, extends do«Ti along the posterior . 

 side of the lower leg; the other is parallel to the first and may be 

 called the tibial artery, tb, since it extends along the anterior or 

 tibial side of the shank. These two arteries give off numerous 

 branches to the muscles of the lower leg. After giving off the fibular 

 and tibial arteries, the sciatic passes, as a large vessel, through the 

 lower leg, to which it gives but few branches, and may here be 

 called the crural artery, cr. At the tarsus it divides rather suddenly 

 and, perhaps, variably, into four chief branches, leading to the 

 toes. 



A short distance caudad to the origin of the iliacs the dorsal aorta 

 gives off a pair of small pelvic arteries, pa', going to the muscles of' 

 that region. Caudal to these pelvis arteries is given off the un- 

 paired first hcemorrhoidal artery, he', which divides into a rectal, rt', 

 and a cloacal, cl, branch. 



Caudal to the first hsemorrhoidal arises the second hcemorrhoidal, 

 he^; also unpaired, leading to the cloaca. 



Posterior to the second hsemorrhoidal, the aorta -continues into 

 the tail as the large caudal artery, ca.

420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



The Anterior Arteries. 



The origin of the great arterial trunks — the pulmonary, aortic 

 arches, primary carotid, and right subclavian— has already been 

 given and the distribution of the pulmonary arteries and aortic 

 arches has been described, so that it now remains to describe the 

 distribution of the right subclavian, fig. 4, Sc.d, and the primary 

 carotid, capr. 



The right subclavian, Sc.d., since it has an independent origin 

 from the heart, instead of arising as a branch of the primary carotid, 

 will be described first. After leaving the heart it passes cephalad 

 and laterad and gives off the following branches in order, beginning 

 at the heart: an (esophageal ai'tery, oe, a small, caudally directed 

 vessel carrying blood to the posterior region of the cesophagus. Close 

 to the oesophageal arises another small, caudally directed vessel, 

 the pleural artery, phi, extending to the pleura and possibly to the 

 pericardium. From the same region as the preceding two arteries, 

 but extending cephalad along the trachea and oesophagus, arises the 

 much larger l)ranch of the right subclavian, the right collateralis 

 colli, cc, whose course and distribution will be described later. 



Close to the distal side of the collateralis colli arises the very 

 small thyroid artery, th, leading to the oval thyroid gland that lies 

 against the ventral surface of the trachea a short distance anterior 

 to the heart. 



A short distance distal to the- thyroid artery the subclavian gives 

 off a fairly large artery, the internal mammary, im' (shown too large 

 in the figure), that passes to the inner surface of the ribs near the 

 sternum and lies parallel to the vein of the same name, described 

 above. 



A short distance distal to the internal mammary arises an artery 

 of about the same diameter, the vertebral, v'; it passes dorsad and 

 caudad to the region of the thoracic vertebra". 



After giving off the five vessels just descriljetl, the subclavian 

 artery passes into the shoulder where it divides into three main 

 branches: (a) the subscapular, sc', going to the skin and muscles of 

 the shoulder; (b) the thoracic, V, carrying blood to the posterior 

 muscles of the shoulder and to the posterior region of the upper 

 arm; (c) the brachial, br', which is really th<' continuation of the 

 subclavian and is the chief artery of the anterior appendage. 



After sending several l^ranches to the upper arm the brachial 

 divides, in the region of the elbow, into two main vessels, the radial, 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



ra', and ulnar, ul', arteries, fig. 4, A. The radial arteiy, in the 

 carpal region, divides in a complicated way into five main vessels 

 that extend into the digits. The ulnar arterj* gives off several 

 branches to the forearm, but apparently does not connect directly 

 with the branches to the digits. 



The primary carotid, capr. After leaving the heart, this very 

 large vessel passes ccphalad and laterad for some distance on the 

 left side of the body and then gives off, from its anterior side, the 

 large left subclavian artery, sc.s., to be described later. After 

 giving off the subclavian artery, it makes a short loo]3, still further 

 to the left, and then turns sharply mediae! to pass to the head in the 

 median plane directly dorsal to the oesophagus. Its distribution 

 in the cervical and cephalic region will be described later. The 

 mate to the oesophageal branch, oe (near heart), of the right sub- 

 clavian which was mentioned above is apparently sometimes given 

 off from the primary carotid near its base (as sho'mi in fig. 4) and 

 sometimes as a branch of the left pleural artery. 



The left subclavian artery, sc.s., although it has a different origin, 

 has the same branches as descriljed in connection with the 'right 

 subclavian. The exact order in which the first of these (the thyroid, 

 th; the internal mammary, im' ; the coUateralis colli, cc; the pleural, 

 plu, and the vertebral. vM are given off is, as might be expected, 

 subject to some variation. ■ 



The collateralis colli, cc (following Bronn's nomenclature), whose 

 origin was noted above, will now be discussed; since the two are 

 alike only one need be described. After leaving the subclavian, it 

 passes cephalad, at the side of the trachea and oesophagus, in com- 

 pany with the internal jugular vein, so that in this part of its course 

 it would seem to be the internal carotid artery. It gives numerous 

 small twigs to the trachea and oesophagus, oe. In the region of 

 the posterior part of the huge jaw muscle it is connected directly, x, 

 with the adjacent branch, cm, (called by Bronn the common carotid) 

 of the primary carotid, and indirectly, x', with a complicated group 

 of branches from the common carotid. Cephalad to the connective 

 x', which extends dorsad and is hence foreshortened in the figure, 

 the collateralis colli gives off a small vessel, y (too large in fig 4), 

 to the shoulder and skin; it then sends a fairly large branch, jra, 

 into the large jaw muscle, close to which it now lies. Next a small 

 branch, Ig, is sent to the larynx. Continuing cephalad and laterad 

 (in figure 4 it is drawn further to the side than it actually lies) for a 

 short distance further, it divides into three branches: (1) a short 




422 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



twig, mg, that goes to the musk glaml on the side of the mandible 

 and to the skin of that region; (2) a large branch, the mandibular, 

 md, that enters the large foramen on the mesial side of the mandible, 

 and extends in the cavity of that l)one throughout its entire length; 

 (3) the Ungual artery, 1\ which, in turn, divides, some distance 

 cephalad, into two branches, one extending along the lateral region, 

 the other nearer the mid-ventral surface of the tongue. It is seen, 

 then, that the collateralis colli arteries supply directly the lower side 

 of the head — tongue, mandible etc. — though they may also send 

 blood through the above-mentioned connectives to the lirain and 

 dorsal regions of the skull. 



The primary carotid, capr, as was noted above, makes a curve to 

 the left after leaving the heart and then passes back to the median 

 plane, where it may be seen lying against the ventral side of the neck 

 muscles and dorsal to the cssophagus; in this place it gives off a 

 series of unpaired cervical arteries, fig. 4, ce, each of which almost 

 immediatelj' divides into an anterior and a posterior branch that 

 carry blood to the cervical vertebrae. At the base of the skull, in 

 the region where it is united by the first connective, x, with the 

 collateralis colli, as descriljed above, the primary carotid divides 

 into two similar branches, called by Bronn the common carotids, cm. 

 The distribution of these two vessels is symmetrical, so that only 

 one need be described. While the collateralis colli, as has been said, 

 carry blood chiefly to the tongue and lower jaw, the common carotids 

 supply the cranium and upper jaw. 



Soon after its formation by the division of the primary carotid, 

 the common carotid is joined, as noted above, with the collateralis 

 colli of that side by the connective x; since the common carotid 

 and its branches all lie dorsal to the collateralis colli and its branches, 

 the connectives x and x^ extend in a more or less dorso-ventral 

 direction. The two common carotids, almost complctelj' surrounded 

 by bone, in passing cephalad sweep first lateralad then mediad, so 

 that they together form almost a complete ellipse, as seen in figure 

 4; there is, however, no apparent connection between them at the 

 anterior region where they lie so close together. 



A short distance cephalad to the connective x the common carotid 

 is connected laterally, z, with a rather complicated plexus of vessels 

 lying at the base of the skull; it is through this plexus that the 

 conunon carotid is connected with the collateralis colli l)y the .second 

 connective, x'. 



The short l)ranch z quickly divides into three parts: (1) a small 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 423 



anteriorly tlirected vessel which may be called the internal carotid, 

 ic, since it enters the skull throua;h the most ventral of the three 

 foramina in the exoccipital. and probably supplies the brain, though its 

 further course could not be followed ; (2) a somewhat larger posteriorly 

 directed artery, oc, going to the muscles at the occipital region of 

 the skull; (3) a short laterally directed stem, z^ T-he last-named 

 branch, z', in turn, leads in three directions: (a) to the collateralis 

 colli artery through the connective x'; (b) a short anteriorly directed 

 vessel, e, that passes into the skull, possibly to the ear, through the 

 large foramen that lies between the exoccipital and quadrate bones; 

 it gives off a small twig, q, to the muscles in the region of the jaw 

 articulation (quadrate) ; (c) the main stem of the branch z continues 

 laterad and cephalad as one of the chief arteries, z-, to the anterior 

 region of the skull, giving off a fairly wide branch, jm', to the large 

 jaw muscle, and then two branches, o^ and o-, to the lateral surface 

 of the eyeball and socket; it then anastomoses, just cephalad and 

 laterad to the eye, with the forward continuation, cm', of the cor- 

 responding main stem, cm, of the common carotid, already men- 

 tioned. The vessel cm', after almost meeting its fellow in the- 

 middle line, passes cephalad and laterad across the ventral surface 

 of the eye to the union, above mentioned, with the lateral branch, z-; 

 at the posterior-mesial border of the eye it gives off a branch that 

 divides into two twigs, one, o^, for the posterior eye muscles, and 

 one, e', to the region of the ear and the top of the sRull. 



At the point of union of the branches cm' and z- a sort of simple 

 ])lexus may be formed from which two vessels, n, pass to the pos- 

 terior nasal region, antl two vessels pass forward along the side of the 

 upper jaw. Of the latter two vessels one, which may be called the 

 inferior dental of the maxilla, dm, is very small and extends along 

 the maxilla to its very tip, at the base of the teeth and ventral to 

 the palatine bone; the other, which is larger and may be called 

 the superior dental of the maxilla, dm', extends cephalad along the 

 mesial side of the maxilla, dorsal to the palatine bone; it sends 

 numerous twigs into the maxillary bone among the roots of the 

 teeth. After passing nearly to the end of the snout, the superior 

 dental, dm', suddenly form-! a loop towards the median line and 

 passes as a straight branch, n', directly caudad, near and parallel to 

 the median plane. The branch n' extends along the floor of the 

 nasal cavity and, after giving off twigs to this chamber, ends in a 

 network of vessels, o-", on the anterior surface of the eyelmll and 

 socket.

THE METHOD OF PROGRESSION IN TRUNCATELLA. 

 BY HEXRY A. PILSBRY AXD AMOS P. BROWX. 



Early in August of 1913, when one of us (Brown) was collecting 

 fossils along the shores of Willoughby Bay, Antigua, upon turning 

 over a piece of limestone a few feet above high-water mark, he came 

 across a colony of Truncatella bilabiata Pfr. They were very plentiful 

 under the slab, and those that were not disturbed by the lifting of 

 the stone were seen to be in motion. Others at once retracted the 

 body into the shell along with the operculum and assumed the 

 appearance of dead shells. On observing those that continued to 

 move it was at once noticed that they do not employ the same 

 method as the rapidly moving Colobostylus and Titdora already 

 observed in Jamaica, nor that of the Cistula observed in Antigua, 

 but seem to adopt the method of the "measuring worm" in their 

 progression. A number of the shells with the living animal were 

 collected in a specimen bottle, and upon returning to the town of 

 St. John's they were kept under observation for some time. In 

 fact, upon returning to Philadelphia soTue weeks later, most of them 

 were still quite lively ami moved about activelj'. It was from 

 these survivors that the figures' were .drawn. Before leaving St. 

 John's, notes upon the method of motion were made. These obser- 

 vations were repeated in Philadelphia. 



When disturbed or startled, the animal at once withdraws into the 

 shell and closes the opening by the operculum, which in fact is 

 drawn in beyond the lip. They then resemble pieces of stone or 

 fragments of dead leaves, and without close observation thjey would 

 escape notice. After they are left to themselves for a short time, 

 th& animal protrudes the operculum, with the foot and proboscis, 

 which latter at once begins to feel about until it encounters some 

 firm substance, when the -foot is fully protruded. The foot is a 

 squarish pad of about 1 square millimeter in area. The proboscis 

 may be extended to li mm. or more. It is waved to and fro until 

 it encounters the surface over which the animal moves, bending 

 downward at the same time and presenting in front view a certain 

 ludicrous resemblance to the head of a moose, which resemblance is 

 enhanced by the blunt expanded snout of the proboscis and by the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 427 



tentacles, which are in the position of the ears of the moose. The 

 foot, when fully protruded, is attached firmly to the surface moved 

 over; the proboscis is then raised and waved about again, and crawling 

 commences. The progression begins by a stretching forward of the 

 prol:>osois, its tip is then applied to the surface moved over, and this 

 tip flattens out until nearly the size of the foot. If the proboscis 

 secures a firm attachment, the foot may now he released, and either 

 drawn up to the attached prol^oscis by sliding the edge of the foot 

 along the surface, or the entire animal maj' be supported upon the 

 proboscis and the foot raised clear of the surface and drawm up to 

 the proboscis, when its edge will rest on the surface moved over. 

 Perhaps more often the foot is raised anteriorly ^nd slid forward 

 upon its posterior edge up to the attached proboscis; the position 

 assumed by the bcxly of the animal being now the same as when 

 it is retracted into the shell. Starting from this position, the method 

 of progression may be described as follows: The square pad of 

 the foot is turned down anteriorly until it is firmly attached to the 

 surface moved over, simultaneously the attachment of the proboscis 

 is released and this is moved to find another attachment; as soon 

 as this is found the firm attachment of the proboscis is effected again; 

 then the entire shell is hitched forward as the foot is lifted and 

 brought up in contact with the under side of the proboscis. In 

 case the foot is lifted clear of the surface moved over, the posterior 

 edge of the foot touches the surface first; if not lifted clear of the 

 ground, this edge is slid or dragged over the surface until the foot 

 comes up to the under side of the proboscis. Its posterior edge is 

 then applied to the ground, and, as the proboscis is loosened and 

 raised, the foot turns down until it is firmly in contact with the 

 ground, and the waving about of the proboscis and its final attach- 

 ment proceeds as before. 



The entire cycle of movements comprising the "step" is executed 

 in four seconds or less, so that the animal will make 15 to 17 "steps" 

 in a minute when advancing steadily in one direction; and in these 

 15 to 17 "steps" it will have moved over 20 to 25 mm. of surface. 

 But it frequently happens that the proboscis does not secure a firm 

 attachment, and, when the step is attempted, the proboscis slides 

 back to the foot and the body is not advanced at all. The proboscis 

 is then raised and waved about, another "step" is attempted, and 

 generally succeeds. The animal may thus move forward in a 

 straight line or it may take quite an erratic course. The shell 

 sometimes rests upon the operculum, sometimes it is simply dragged 




428 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



along the ground; and it is jerked forward when the foot is raised, 

 sometimes supported upon the opercuhim, Init quite as often not. 

 The muscles controlling the movement of the foot and of the pro- 

 boscis can evidently act quite independently of each other. 



The e.vternal soft parts of T. bilabiata are very pale cartridge bufT. 

 There is an ill-defined, flesh-tinted spot on the proboscis, caused by 

 some colored body, perhaps the radula and its sack, shining through. 

 The proboscis has faint annular wrinkles. 



Compared with other land operculate snails we have seen alive, 

 Truncatelln is remarkat)le for the small size of the foot and tlie 

 extraordinary development of the proboscis. 



The terrestrial prosobranch gastropods show a good deal of diver- 

 sity in dealing with the problem of progression on a dry surface. 

 The Cydophoridw glide, like aquatic tsenioglossate forms. The 

 Ericiidce move by the forward translation of vertical folds, alternating 

 on the two sides of the foot, while the TruncateUidce step. The 

 gait of Pomatiopsis lapiclaria is intermediate between the step and 

 the glide, and serves to show how the gait of Truncatella was probably 

 evolved. The proboscis and oral disk are used exactly as in Trunca- 

 tella, but the foot moves by gliding or sliding, first the fore part 

 moving forward to the proboscis, then the back part.

though perhaps descending to the ground to deposit eggs. No doubt 



It IS found living among the hills all through the southwestern corner 



of the island; this portion is still fairly well covered with woods and 



affords good cover. While found fossil in the northern and north- 




430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



eastern portions, as at Hodge's Bay on the north shore and at St. 

 George's Church along the eastern shore, the probability is that the 

 species is extinct in this portion of the island, as all the woods have 

 been cut, thus destroying the natural cover. The northwestern por- 

 tion of the island is wooded in the vicinity of Wetherill's Bay, but 

 the woods are probably only of recent growth and no recent specimens 

 of this species were found there. In the southwestern portion, in 

 St. Mary's Parish, living specimens are found mainly on the 

 "loblolly" trees (Pisonia subcaudata); although the woods are suf- 

 ciently dense to afford moist conditions in many places. In the less 

 wooded (and hence arid) parts of St. Mary's the specimens are also 

 found living in the trees. In the region of Willoughby Bay, Parish 

 of St. Philip, the. conditions are still more arid, and living specimens 

 were seen only on the trees. The "wild pines" {Brorneliacece) 

 seem to be the places where the living moUusks are most certainly 

 to be met with. These epiphytes, containing as they do in the 

 axils of their leaves the only water commonly to be found on these 

 dry hills, are evidently resorted to by the moUusks for their supply 

 of moisture; and it is the presence of these "wild pines" with their 

 constant supply of moisture that has tempted the P. formosa to 

 acquire an arboreal habit and pass from ground forms to a more 

 or less arboreal life.

THE EVOLUTION OF SARCOCYSTIS MUEIS IN THE INTESTINAL CELLS OF 



THE MOUSE. 



(Preliminary Note.) 

 BY HOWARD CRAWLEY. 



As long ago as 1903, Minchin (1903, p. 308), speaking of the 

 Sarcosporidia, observes that "there is still much to be made out about 

 these interesting parasites, and the field is one ripe for investigation." 



Since that time it cannot be said that our knowledge of the group 

 has been materially increased. A number of papers on the Sarco- 

 sporidia have indeed been published, but these have been concerned 

 with the character of the spores and cysts rather than with any 

 attempts to elucidate the life history- of this group of the Protozoa. 

 The exception is a contribution l)y Erdmann (1910, p. 377), the 

 results of which are simimed up and commented upon ])y Minchin 

 (1912, pp. 421, 422) as follows: 



"According to Erdmann, the spore germinates in the intestine of 

 the new host, and the first act in the process is the liberation from 

 the spore of its toxin, sarcocystine, which causes the adjacent epithe- 

 lium of the intestine to be thrown off. At the same time an amoebula 

 is set free from the spore: and^ owing to the intestine being denuded 

 of its lining epithelium, the amcebula.is able to penetrate into the 

 lymph-spaces of the sulimucous coat and establish itself there. 

 Before this happens, however, the metachromatinic grains of the 

 spore disappear, and it is suggested that this disappearance is related 

 to the secretion of the sarcocystine, and that the toxin is contained 

 in the metachromatinic grains. If, however, a polar capsule be 

 discharged during the germination of the spore, as in other Cnido- 

 sporidia, it might well be that the toxin is contained in the polar 

 capsule and is set free by it< discharge, like the poison in th(> neinato- 

 cysts of the Ccelentera. However that may be, it would ai^pear as 

 if the sarcocystine were a weapon, as it were, the function of which 

 is to facilitate the inva-^ion of the germ, the anurbula, by destroying 

 the lining epithelium of the gut. 



The liberation of the amoebula from the spore initiates the first 

 period of the development, which is passed in the lymph-spaces of 

 the intestine, and which lasts, according to Erdmann, some twenty- 

 eight to thirty days, .\nalogy with other Xeos]i()ri(lia would lead 

 us to identify this with the jilanont-pha^e. initiated, possibly, by 

 sexual processes between difi'erent ama't)ula' aii<l subseiiuent active 

 multiplication. The second period of the development begins with 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 433 



the penetration of the amcebula into a muscle-fiber, in which the 

 parasite grows uito a .Aliescher's tube and forms spores." 



The present writer has for some time been in possession of material 

 which illustrates the earlier stages of the cycle of Sarcocystis muris 

 in the mouse, but sufficient time has not been available completely 

 to work out this cycle in all of its details. Since, however, Erdmann's 

 conclusions are largely erroneous, and since, moreover, they are 

 becoming incorporated into general works on the Protozoa it has 

 been considered desirable to publish a brief notice giving the essen- 

 tial facts discovered, which are of considerable theoretical interest 

 A short note bearing on this matter was published in Science (1913 

 n. s., v. 37, p. 498) last year, but this did not touch upon the more 

 important of the discoveries made. 



As stated in the note which appeared in Science, the spore when 

 in the lumen of the intestine of the mouse does not set free an amce- 

 bula, since it is itself a naked mass of protoplasm. AVhat actually 

 takes place is that the spore, when in the intestine of the mouse 

 becomes endowed with the ability to display very energetic twisting 

 and boring movements, by virtue of which it forces its way into a 

 cylinder cell of the intestinal epithelium, and there comes to rest 

 This takes place within 2i hours after the infecting feed, and possiblv 

 much earlier. 



The typical spore of Sarcocystis muris, which has been fi-ured a 

 number of tunes in the literature, is a banana-shaped organism about 

 12,a long. Spores of this sort are found both free in the lumen and in 

 the cylinder cells in mice killed and examined at appropriate periods 

 after the inoculative feed. Besides these, however, others occur such 

 as are shown in Plate XV. figs. 1 and 2. These are oval bodies 

 generally about half as long as the typical spore. The cytoplasm 

 has a considerable affinity for chromatin stains and consist^ of a 

 dense spongioplasm. The nucleus is vesicular and more conspicuous 

 than It IS in the typical spores. It apparently always contains either 

 a feebly developed nuclear net (fig. 3) or a karvosome or both but 

 these last-named structures require heavy staining for their demon 

 stration, and in moderately or lightly stained material the appearance 

 IS as shown in figs. 1 and 2. 



Figures 2 and 3 represent conditions found in a mouse killed about 

 2i hours after feeding. Since, however, the spores in the lumen of 

 the intestine of this mouse are in precisely the same state as tho.se 

 illustrated in fig. 2, the presumption is that these latter hav- only 

 been in the cells a very short time. IMoreover, the intracellular 




434 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [May, 



parasites both in 2j- and 3j-hour stages have, at least in a certain 

 proportion of cases, undergone conspicuous changes. These changes 

 consist in a gradual diminution of the quantitj' of cytoplasm, which 

 seems either largely or completely to disappear, while con- 

 commitantly there is an increase in size and complexity of the 

 nucleus. There is in this way produced a parasite such as is shown 

 in fig. 4, which, so far as both its history and appearance go, is 

 only the nucleus of the original spore. The stage here represented 

 is especially characteristic of the period about six hours after feeding. 

 It may, however, be stated that it is not certain that all of the 

 parasites which invade the cells suffer this loss of the cytoplasm. 



In mice killed nine hours after feeding, this same stage (as shown 

 iu fig. 4) may also be found, !)ut it is no longer abundant. This 

 period in the evolution of the parasite, that is, nine hours after 

 feeding, is characterized by a great variety of conditions, uf which 

 the majority are difficult to interpret. But by this time it has 

 become evident that the parasites are separating into two categories, 

 which l)ecome more and more sharply differentiated as time passes, 

 and which reach their full culmination at the end of 18 hours. Ths 

 end products of these two lines of evolution are shown in figs. 

 9 and 11, and the interpretation placed upon them is that they are 

 respectively males and females. 



The male elements appear to arise from forms like that shown in 

 fig. 4. These, which apparently consist of only the nucleus of 

 the original spore, show a karyosome, and a nuclear net which here 

 and there supports little aggregates of chromatin. Later stages 

 (fig. 5) show a greater quantity of chromatin, but the karyo.some has 

 disappeared. Figure 5 is to be taken merely as representing one of 

 a number of forms which, whih' differing greatly in detail, agree in 

 that each possesses a nuclear net which supports a quantity of 

 chromatin. In some cases the chromatin occurs in a much coar.ser 

 form than that shown in fig. 5, whereas in others it is jiresent in 

 very minute granules distributed throughout the entire extent of a 

 finely meshed net. 



Eventually, however, a stage is reached such as is shown in fig. 

 7. This consists of an oval body with a stringy matrix and a row of 

 granular aggregates arranged around the iierijihery. Tliese granular 

 aggregates become more and more compact until finally they come 

 to consist of solid, round balls of deeply staining chromatin (fig. 8). 

 These balls, in their turn, elongate and transform themselves into 

 bodies such as are shown in fig. 9, which can scarcely be other 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 435 



than microgametes. As seen in sectioned material, the microga- 

 metes are from 2 to 2.5 microns long, with both ends pointed, but one 

 noticeably broader than the other. They are characterized by an 

 intense affinity for chromatin stains. Stages such as these may 

 occur as early as nine hours, but it is not until later that they become 

 abundant. They reach their full development at the end of 18 

 hours, and, so far as my studies have yet gone, are no longer present 

 at the end of 24 hours. 



It is only in their later developmental phases that the females can 

 be picked out with any certainty. They are illustrated in figs. 

 10 and 11, which show oval elements containing a vesicle in which 

 is a chromatin body. In the 18-hour stage all of the parasites 

 present, with a certain exception to be noted below, are either in the 

 condition shown in figs. 7, 8, and 9, or that shown in figs. 10 

 and 11. As was stated above, however, the parasites taken to be 

 early male stages were apparently only nuclei, since if any cytoplasm 

 were present it was reduced to an extremely fine peripheral "film. 

 This conclusion was based not only upon the history of these bodies, 

 but also upon their appearance. On the other hand, the bodies 

 shown in figs. 10 and 11 have all the appearance of complete cells, 

 with a considerable bulk of cytoplasm. It may then be that from 

 the very outset some of the parasites retain a part or the whole of 

 their cytoplasm, these being destined to produce the macrogametes. 

 This surmise receives a certain amount of support from what is seen 

 m fig. 6. This parasite appears to have retained at least the 

 greater part of its cytoplasm. But we have here the representative 

 of a condition found nine hours after feeding, whereas the loss of 

 cytoplasm on the part of those parasites which suffer this depriva- 

 tion may be completed as early as 2| to 3 hours. It may then be 

 suggested that fig. 6 represents an early female stage, and if this 

 be so it would follow that the females retain most if not all of their 

 cytoplasm. It may also be noted that in the periods from 9 to 18 

 hours parasites which are clearly females show phenomena which 

 suggest maturation. 



Finally, in the 18-hour period there is to be found the condition 

 illustrated in fig. 12. This shows a parasite in all respects like 

 figs. 10 and 11 except for the presence in the cytoplasm of a 

 sharply staining chromatin body. It does not seem unreasonable 

 to look upon this as a microgamete which has ■ fertilized the 

 macrogamete.

KOTICOr AK.HE "--«,--,^--^DOX ...SZKOSXHIS, 0. TH. 

 BY ROY CHAPMAN ANDREWS. 



The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has been for- 

 tunate in securing the skeleton of a rare Beaked whale, Mesoplodon 

 d.«stroJns (Blainville), taken at Corson's Inlet, N. J., June 18, 

 1913, by Henry W. Fowler and Wm. J. Fox. This specimen 

 makes possible the first positive identification of this animal 

 on the American coast and, since it has hitherto been known only 

 from the seas about Australia and the Indian Ocean, gives important 

 evidence as to the extensive range of the species 



In 1906 Dr Glover M. Allen,^ reported up^n a young female 

 Beaked whale found dead on the coast at Annisquam, Mass in 

 August, 1898, the skeleton of which was secured for the Boston 

 Society of Natural History by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt. Dr Allen 

 referredthis specimen to Mesoplodon bidens (Sowerby) and gave a 

 description of the skeleton and external anatomy so far as the latter 

 was known Some years later Dr. F. W. True= restudied the speci- 

 men, the skull of which is somewhat injured, and decided that it 

 probably represented Mesoplodon densirostris (BlainviUe) In con- 

 cluding his discussion of this specimen. Dr. True remarks- 

 "Altfiough witli such scant material it is not possible to determine 

 satisfactorily the identity of this third species of Mesoplodon in the 

 North Atlantic, represented by the Annisquam specimen I feel 

 convinced that that specimen does not belong to M. bidens and that 

 there is a strong probability that it belongs to M. densirostris It is 

 true that the latter species has been found hitherto onlv in the 

 Indian Ocean and about Australia, but we know so little about the 

 distribution of the ziphioid whales that, in my opinion, that circum- 

 stance by Itself should not be given very great weight." (I.e.,

in the Osleographie des Cetaces, Plate XXV, demonstrates that it 

 is certainly referable to that species. It also shows the distinctive 

 characters of the rostrum and other parts of the skull present in the 

 Massachusetts skeleton and leaves little doubt that Dr. True's 

 identification of the latter with M. densirostris is correct. The 

 New Jersey specimen thus definitely introduces Alesoplodon densi- 

 rostris into the North American fauna. 



I have to thank Mr. Henry W. Fowler for the privilege of examining 

 and reporting upon this specimen and to congratulate the Academy 

 upon its acquisition. 



It is desirable to give a brief description of the exterior and skeleton 

 as well as figures of certain bones since the osteology of the species, 

 other than the skull, is rather imperfectly known. 



Mr. Fowler has furnished the following notes upon the external 

 characters of the specimen: "In color the skin was mostly uniform 

 blackish, smooth and shining. About the head and jaws, below, 

 and irregularly along the ventral surface medianly, were livid pale 

 areas sometimes with very faint bluish tints. Afterward various 

 parts of the body became somewhat reddish in tint due to decom- 

 position going on. The flukes of the tail and the dorsal and pec- 

 toral fins were entirely black. 



"This whale had been dead but a very short time when discovered, 

 and had evidently been struck with some object, possibly a harpoon, 

 on the side of the neck. 



" It has also bled a little at the mouth as may be seen from the 

 photograph (this wrongly suggesting the corner of the mouth). 

 The photograph does not give a good idea of the greatly elevated 



gums of the lower jaw No barnacles or parasites of any 



kind were found in, or on, this specimen. The stomach was full 

 of undetermined organic material. The whale was 14 feet 5 inches 

 long and 4 feet in circumference." 



The skeleton shows that the individual from which it was taken, 

 although not old, was fully adult, for the mesorostral cartilage is 

 thoroughly ossified and all the epiphyses are firmly ankylosed to the 

 vertebral bodies. 



The skulls of the Massachusetts and New Jersey specimens agree 

 closely in all important particulars, the only noticeable difference 

 being in the absence in the former of the maxillary tubercle between 

 the anteorbital notch and the l)ase of the rostrum. This is sup- 

 posedly a character of age, but is even less developed in the adu!t 

 specimen figured in the OsUographie des Citads. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 439 



In both the Massachusetts and New Jersey skulls the large foramina 

 in the maxillae are almost opposite those in the premaxillae, while 

 in the Osteographie figure the former are considerably in advance 

 of the latter. 



The peculiar characters of the skull -which distinguish M. densi- 

 rostris are the deep rostrum and the depth and shape of the rostral 

 portion of the premaxillse; the large, forwardly directed foramina 

 in the maxillae which connect with the grooves on either side of the 

 rostrum ; the appearance of the malar in the bottoms of the anteor- 

 bital notches; the large palatines which entirely surround the 

 pterygoids; the trifoliate foramen magnum and the mandible, each 

 ramus of which is greatly swollen in the region of the single triangular 

 tooth. 



The skeleton has the foUomng vertebral formula: 



C D L Ca 



7 10 11 16 = 44 



Certainly one, and possibly two, of the terminal caudal vertebrae are 

 missing, so that the correct formula should probably be: 



C D L Ca 



7 10 11 18 = 46 



A skeleton of this species from the island of Lord Howe, Australia, 

 has .the following formula, according to Van Beneden and Gervais: 



CD L Ca 



7 10 11 17 = 45 



This whale measured 15 feet 9 inches in length, while the New Jersey 

 specimen was 14 feet 5 inches long. 



Allen gives the number of vertebrae in the Massachusetts skeleton 

 as 45, but says it has only nine pairs of ribs, while both others have 

 ten pairs. It is probable that the terminal pair in Allen's specimen 

 may have been lost, as Cetacean skeletons are so frequently deficient 

 in this respect. 



The first three cervical vertebrae of the New Jersey whale are 

 solidly ankylosed, but the remaining four are free. 



The dorsal and lumbar vertebrae have the thigh, thin spines and 

 short transverse processes so characteristic of the Ziphioid whales. 



Nine chevrons are present, but the first and penultimate members 

 of the series seem to be lacking, and I believe that eleven is the normal 

 number. 



There are ten pairs of ribs, the first seven on each side articulating 




440 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [MaV, 



by means of a neck and head and the posterior three having only 

 the tubercles; the terminal rib is very slender. 



The sternum consists of four segments showing no tendency, as 

 yet, toward ankjdosis. The most anterior is concave above with 

 a well-defined median carina below; the three remaining segments 

 are flat with a median notch in both the anterior and posterior 

 borders. 



The sternum agrees well with that of the Massachusetts specimen 

 figured by Allen except that the first segment of the New Jersey 

 sternum is a little differently shaped and is much more deeply notched 

 than in the former. This difference has no significance. 



The scapula is widely fan-shaped, has a long, thin acromion curved 

 inward and slightly upward, and a straight narrow coracoid directed 

 somewhat upward and almost as long as the acromion. 



The scapula resembles that of Mesoplodon bidens figured in the 

 Ostiographie des Cetaces, PL XXII, fig. 2. 



8everal of the phalanges from each manus have been lost and, 

 consequently, the correct formula cannot be given.

DATA ON THE OKTHOPTERAN FAUNISTICS OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA 

 AND SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY. 



BY HENRY FOX. 



In the period from 1908 to 1912, inclusive, I collected Orthoptera 

 extensively in various parts of the area here under consideration, 

 spending as much time in the field as I could spare from other duties. 

 During that time I accumulated data on the regional and habitat 

 distribution of various species of Acrididce and Locustidoe, which, 

 although admittedly incomplete, suggest at least the general lines 

 along which the study of such problems may ultimately be developed. 

 In this study I endeavored to ascertain, in the first place, the exact 

 areal distrilnition of each species and, secondly, the kind of environ- 

 ment in which it normally or prevailingly occurs. 



The present paper is based upon the results of my own field obser- 

 vations, but to make it as complete as possible I have freely availed 

 myself of all available sources of information and have frequently 

 included data gathered by others, due acknowledgment of which 

 I have endeavored to make in every case. In this connection I have 

 found the distributional data given in the new N. J. State Report on 

 insects^ especially valuable. I am also under obligations to Mr. 

 James A. G. Rehn and Mr. Morgan Hebard for generously placing 

 their local collections and those of the Academy of Natural Sciences 

 of Philadelphia at my disposal antl for permission to use the data 

 so obtained. 



Witmer Stone, in his splendid work on the plants of southern 

 New Jersey,- remarks on the incongruity of finding a southern flora 

 and fauna by going eastward, as may be done in the vicinity of 

 Philadelphia. The same incongruity is exemplified by the Orthop- 

 tera which in southern New Jersey are predominantly of austral 

 aspect, whereas those of eastern Pennsylvania are mostly of transition 

 types. 



As is well known, the region included in the present study includes

parts of two great physiographic provinces, the Piedmont Plateau 

 and the Coastal Plain. These correspond, as Stone has clearly 

 shown in the work already cited, respectively to the Transition and 

 Upper Austral biotic zones of Merriam. The dividing line between 

 two is accordingly the "fall-line" which marks the line along which 

 the hard rocks of the Piedmont Plateau meet the soft and incoherent 

 deposits of the Coastal Plain. 



Without a more detailed knowledge than we actually possess of 

 the life history and of the developmental and growth requirements 

 of Orthoptera, it is impossible at present to give a full causal explana- 

 tion of the observed differences between the Orthopteran faunas of 

 the Piedmont Plateau and Coastal Plain. Merriam regards tem- 

 perature as the controlling factor, and he is probably right if by 

 temperature he means the temperature of the medium in which the 

 organism undergoes its development and growth, and this in a given 

 locality might be very different in one kind of medium from what it 

 is in a different kind, a difference which would not be shown by a 

 record of the atmospheric temperature alone. Some of the Coastal 

 Plain grasshoppers, which in this region are entirely absent from the 

 Piedmont Plateau, exist in much higher latitudes, as in Massachu- 

 setts or Ontario, where the sum of the positive atmospheric tem- 

 peratures for the season of growth and reproduction is much less 

 than in our local Piedmont, but they doubtless exist there under 

 conditions in which they receive a greater amount of heat at the 

 critical time than they would under entirely different conditions in 

 a region which, like our Piedmont, is warmer so far as general atmos- 

 pheric temperatures are concerned. 



Although temperature is proliably the fundamental distributional 

 factor, there are good reasons for questioning if it is the only factor. 

 The environment of any organism or groui) of organism^ i-^ a complex 

 of factors, each of which niayact directlj' on the organism and iniluence 

 its activities. Shelford, for example, has shown that in the case of 

 certain species of tiger-beetles' the distribution depends upon the 

 simultaneous presence of a number of conditions, all of which must 

 be fulfilled if the species is to maintain itself. 



In our region the great contrast between the biotas of the Piedmont 

 and Coastal Plain provinces is at least empirically — and doubtless 

 in some way causally — correlated with well-marked differences in 

 the prevailing types of soil. In the Piedmont the soils are residual,

resulting from the decomposition and disintegration of the underlymg 

 rocks. They are of a loamy texture containing relatively high pro- 

 portions of clay and silt and also holding in most instances a con- 

 siderable amount of available plant food. The Coastal Plain soils, 

 with some exceptions, represent detrital materials originally trans- 

 ported by water and floating ice from the front of the great continental 

 glacier. They consist almost exclusively of coarse gravels and sands 

 which contain extremely low amounts of clay or silt and are very 

 deficient in available plant foods. 



The differences in biota are also correlated with differences in 

 topography. The Piedmont Plateau is a region of considerable 

 relief and consequently of good drainage, so that marshy areas 

 constitute an insignificant feature of the region. The Coastal 

 Plain, with the exception of a portion along its western edge, is a 

 region of extremely low relief and poor drainage, so that marshes 

 form a very prominent feature of the region. 



Faunal Subdivisions.— The map accompanying Smith's report 

 on insects in the 1909 report of the New Jersey State Museum 

 subdivides the State into six faunal districts. This map was largely 

 based upon the results of Stone's studies on the distribution of 

 plants, although no acknowledgment of this fact is made in the text. 

 In the map accompanying Stone's report on plants already cited 

 the southern or Coastal Plain portion of the State is subdivided into 

 five districts. Stone does not consider the region north of the 

 fall-line in detail, but simply refers to it as the Northern District 

 without any attempt at further subdivision. In Smith's report 

 the same region is subdivided into three districts, i.e., the Appalachian, 

 the Highlands, and the Piedmont Plateau. All three of thesS sub- 

 divisions are represented in Pennsylvania. 



The subdivisions of the Coastal Plain recognized by Stone are 

 (a) the Middle District; (b) the Pine Barrens; (c) the Coastal Strip, 

 including the coast islands and a narrow strip of mainland adjoining 

 the salt marshes; (rf) the Cape May Peninsula south of the Great 

 Cedar Swamp, and (e) the Maritime District, embracing the salt 

 marshes. 



In the case of the Orthoptera, these same subdivisions can be 

 readily recognized, but to my mind they are not all of equal faunistic 

 value. As major or primary faunal centres I would class the Appa- 

 lachian, Piedmont, Pine Barren, and Coastal districts, because each 

 of these is definitely characterized by a number of species which are 

 either entirely absent or relatively infrequent in the other districts. 




444 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JunP. 



The remaining subdivisions I am disposed to consider as tension 

 zones in whicli there is more or less intermingling, overlapping, or 

 interdigitation of the faunas from the surrounding primary districts. 

 The faunistic status of the Highlands is still somewhat doubtful, 

 owing to the lack of sufficient data, but the data at hand indicate 

 that its only distinctive feature is the overlapping of Piedmont and 

 Appalachian types. The Middle District does not have a single 

 distinctive species of Orthoptera,'' but represents a zone in which 

 there is an intermingling of characteristic Piedmont, Pine Barren, 

 and Coastal types. The Cape May District has some claim to be 

 regarded as a primary district, since two or three Orthoptera have 

 been taken there which have not as yet been recorded elsewhere, but 

 which future collecting may possibly prove to extend into the Middle 

 and Coastal Districts. The Maritime District is very clearly charac- 

 terized from all the other districts, but I think it preferable to regard 

 it as an ecological subdivision of the Coastal District rather than a 

 separate faunistic region. 



I. The Appalachian District. 



The Ap]5alachian District includes the region between the Blue 

 Ridge and the Alleghany escarpment, thus taking in all of central 

 and northeastern Pennsylvania and extreme northwestern New 

 Jersey. Topographically, the greater part of the region consists, as 

 is well kno\\m, of a succession of roughly parallel ridges and inter- 

 vening valleys. In northeastern Penns.ylvania these merge into a 

 high ])lateau, the Pocono Plateau. The underlying rocks are all 

 thoroughly indurated sedimentaries, which typically are charac- 

 terized by steep dips and sharp folds, but in the Pocono Plateau 

 Region are nearly horizontal or only gently folded. The soils for the 

 most part are residual, and are essentially similar to those of the 

 Piedmont. There is much bare rock on the higher ridges and 

 steeper slopes. In the Pocono Region the soils are largely of glacial 

 origin. 



I have had no direct {>ersona! experience with the Orthopteran 

 fauna of this district and consequently am dependent for information 

 regarding its character upon the reports of other collectors. The 

 chief sources of information are the records included in the New 

 Jersey list and the collection of the Acaderny of Natural Sciences, 

 the latter including collections of Stewardson Brown and Witmer 



* The one exception to this statement, Melanoplus different talis, represents 

 an introduction from the West.

Stone from Wyoming and Sullivan Counties; of Bayard Long from 

 Monroe, Sullivan, Pike, and Wayne Counties; of Rehn from Lehigh 

 Gap, and the official Pennsylvania State Collection, the latter including 

 material from the vicinity of Harrisburg and central Pennsylvania. 

 The Academy collection also includes individual specimens collected 

 by C. W. Johnson, 0. Behr, W. S. Huntington, and Dr. Joseph Leidy. 

 From these sources we have tangible evidence of the occurrence of 

 the following species of Orthoptera in northeastern Pennsylvania, 

 including under this term the counties of Lehigh, Carbon, Wyoming, 

 Sullivan, Monroe, Wayne, and Pike.

446 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JUHC, 



The above lists are doubtless individually incomplete. On the 

 whole, collections made in the Appalachian District are essentially 

 Piedmont in character with the addition of some prevailingly northern 

 species which are absent or rare in the Piedmont. It is probable at 

 least from the data at hand that the following species occur regularly 

 throughout the entire local Appalachian District: OrphulcUa 

 speciosa, ChlaeaUis conspersa, Stenobothrus curtipennis, Arphia 

 sulphurea, A. xanthoptera , Chortophaga viridifasciata, Encoptolophus 

 sordidus, Hippiscus luberculatus, Dissosteira Carolina, Spharagemon 

 bolli, S. saxatile, Melanoplus fasciatus, M. atlanis, M. fernur-rubriim, 

 M. minor, M. femoratus, Scudderia curvicauda, S. furrnta, Ainbly- 

 corypha oblongifolia, A. rotundifolia, Conocephalus triops, C. ensiger, 

 Orchelimum vulgare, Xiphidium fasciatum, X. brevipenne, X. nemorale, 

 and Atlanlicus dorsalis. 



The following have so far been recorded only for the more northern 

 section of the local Appalachian District, to which it is possible that 

 they may be restricted: Mecostethus lineatus, Camnula pellucida, 

 Circotettix verruculatus, Podisma glacialis variegata, Melanoplus 

 mancus,^ M. pundulatus, and Saidderia pistillata.^ 



It is rather surprising that we have no local records of Melanoplus 

 luridus in the Appalachian District, this being a form which is 

 prevailingly northern in distribution and which has been recorded 

 from the mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. 



Another species, Xiphidium^ saltans, probably occurs in the dis- 

 trict, but I know of no actual records of its capture. 



The most distinctive Orthoptera of the Appalachian District are 

 Camnula pellucida, Spharagemon saxatile, Trimerotropis citrina 

 Circotettix verruculatus, Podisma variegata, Melanoplus mancus 

 (probably), and Xiphidium nemorale. These species are either 

 confined to the district or recur only in the Highlands. 



The majority of Appalachian Orthoptera are Piedmont types. 

 These include Orphidella speciosa, Dichromorpha viridis,'' Chlcealtis 

 conspersa, Stenobothrus curtipennis, Arphia sulphurea, A. xanthoptera, 

 Chortophaga viridifasciata, Encoptolophus sordidus, Hippiscus tuber- 

 culatus, Dissosteira Carolina, Spharagemon bolli, Melanoplus atlanis, 

 M. femur-rubrum, M. minor, M. femoratus, Scudderia texensis, S. 



' Recorded from the Highlands of New Jersey, but doubtless occur in the 

 Appalachians. 



' I am not sure whether this .species ought to be ranked as an Appalachian 

 species or not. It is abundant in the Piedmont and has been taken along the 

 edge of the Appalachian, but I know of no records from typical Appalachian 

 countrj-. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 447 



curvicauda, S. furcata, Amblycorypha oblongifolia, A. roiundifolia, 

 Conocephalus triops, Orchelimum vulgare, Xiphidium fasciatum, 

 X. hrevipenne, and Atlanticus dorsalis. 



Some Appalachian Orthoptera are as yet unrecorded for the 

 Piedmont Region, but recur in the Coastal Plain. Among these are 

 Mecostethus lineatus, Melanoplus fascialus, M. pundulalus, Scudderia 

 pistillata, S. septentrionalis, and Conocephalus ensigner. 



No extensive studies of Appalachian Orthopteran habitats have 

 been made, so far as I am aware. Spharagemon saxatile is a saxicolous 

 form and in the New Jersey list is stated to occur on rocky ridges. 

 Doubtle.ss its habitat in this region is like that described by Morse 

 for New England and the Southern States. Podisma variegata 

 appears from data recorded by Rehn* to be constantly associated 

 with hemlock woods, occurring, according to one observer, Mr. Behr, 

 on the branches of the trees, but according to W. S. Huntington 

 occasionally in grass. 



II. The Highlands. 



As already mentioned, I am not inclined to regard the Highlands 

 as of primary faunistic rank, but rather as a sort of tension area 

 where the typical Piedmont fauna meets and intermingles with 

 outlying representatives of the Appalachian fauna. The data from 

 the region are unfortunately very meagre and are almost entirely 

 restricted to the New Jersey section, the Pennsylvania Highlands 

 being unrepresented in any of the publications or collections examined 

 by me. 



The topography of the Highlands is essentially that of the Appa- 

 lachian Region, but the ridges are lower and have less precipitous 

 slopes. The soils are of residual origin and are of the same character 

 as the typical Piedmont soils. 



The grasshopper fauna of the Highlands has never been fully 

 described, but it will probably be found to include the following 

 forms :

' III. The Piedmont District. 



The Piedmont Region of New- Jersey consists of a rather narrow 

 belt of gently to moderately rolling country formed almost entirelj' 

 by the red shales and sandstone of Triassic age, but in Pennsjdvania 

 it widens rapidly and includes rocks of many kinds. All of these 

 are thoroughly consolidated and, with the exception of the Triassic 

 series, are more or less extensively metamorphosed. Topographically, 

 the Piedmont possesses considerable relief, but is less rugged than 

 either the Appalachian or Highland Regions, the highe.st elevations 

 rarely exceeding 600 feet above sea-level. This, however, is sufficient 

 to produce relatively swift-flowing streams and thereby to ensure 

 good drainage. As a result, permanently moist tracts are of limited 

 extent and are largely restricted to soggy patches about spring-heads 

 or to seepage depressions on the level tracts liordering the streams. 



The soils of the Piedmont are residual. They are highly variable 

 in composition and texture in accordance with the varied nature of 

 the underlying rock formations. All agree, however, in having a 

 loamy texture, the silt-clay content never, according to the published

analyses of the U. S. Bureau of Soils, falling below 35%. Most of 

 the Piedmont soils have a sufficiently open texture to permit the 

 ready percolation of water, but their high silt content enables them 

 to readily conserve the supply, so that, except in periods of excep- 

 tional drought, the amount of moisture available for plant growth 

 is considerable. Being derived either directly or indirectly from 

 crystalline rocks, they are in most instances rich in essential plant- 

 foods, especially potash, lime and magnesium. For these reasons 

 the dominant type of vegetation is mesophytic and with this is 

 correlated the presence of a prevailingly mesophilous grasshopper 

 fauna. Originally the whole region was densely forested, the domi- 

 nant tree growth consisting of hardwoods, but at the present time 

 this has been largely removed and the country converted into farm- 

 lands and pastures. 



The grasshopper fauna of the Piedmont, exclusive of tettigids and 

 nocturnal locustids, includes, to my knowledge, the following species : 



Pseudopomala brachyptera Melanoplus femur-rubrum 

 Eritettix carinatus " minor 



Orphulella speciosa " luridus 



" pelidna " femoratus 



Dichromorpha viridis Scudderia texensis 

 ChlaeaUis conspersa " curvicauda 



Stenobolhrus curtipennis " furcata 



Arphia sulphurea Amblycorypha oblongifolia 

 " xanthoptera " rotundifolia 



Chortophaga riridifasciata Microcentrum sp. 



Encoptolophus sordidus Conocephalus triops 



Hippiscus tuberculatus Orchelimum vulgar e 



" rugosus " spmidosum 



Dissosteira Carolina Xiphidiuni fasciatum 

 Spharagemon bolli " brcvipenne 



Melanoplus scudderi " slriclum 



" tribulus Atlanticus dorsalis 



" atlanis 



Of these species those most distinctive of the Piedmont Region 

 are Dichromorpha viridis, Orphulella speciosa, Stenobothrus curti- 

 pennis, Encoptolophus sordidus, Hippiscus tuberculatus, and Mel- 

 anoplus minor. Each of these appears to be either absent, rare or 

 local in the Coastal Plain. 



The most abundant species in the Piedmont, as in the entire eastern 

 section of the continent, is the red-legged grasshopper, Melanoplus 

 femur-rubrimi. This species is present far in excess of any of the 

 other species. Next in point of numbers come such forms as Dichro- 




450 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



morpha viridis, Dissosteira Carolina, Encoptolophiis sordidus, Mel- 

 anoplus fernoratus, Chortophaga viridifasciata and Orchelimuin vulgare. 

 Other common, but somewhat restricted, forms are Steiiobothrus 

 curtipemiis, Arphia xanthoptera , Arphia sidphurea, Orphtdella speciosa, 

 Melanoplus atlams, Melanoplus minor, Melanoplus scudderi, Xiphi- 

 dium brevipenne, Xiphidium fasciatum, Conocephalus triops, Orcheli- 

 mum spinulosum, Scudderia curvicauda, and Scudderia f areata. 



The following are not uncommon in certain localities, but appar- 

 ently are rare or lacking in many parts of the Piedmont: Hippiscus 

 tuberculatus, Hippiscus rugosus, Xiphidium strictum and Amhlii- 

 corypha oblongijolia. 



The following may in general be regarded as rather scarce members 

 of the Piedmont fauna, although in favorable spots they may be 

 represented in considerable numbers: Eritettix carinatus, Ckltsaltis 

 conspersa, Spharagemon belli, Melanoplus luridus, Amblycorypha 

 roiundifoUa and Atlanticus dorsalis. 



Of exceptional occurrence, though in restricted locations some- 

 times present in surprising numbers, are Pseudopornala brachypkra, 

 Orphulella pelidna, Melanoplus tribulus and Scudderia texensis. 

 The first and third of these' have, I believe, been taken only on the 

 Conowingo Barrens of southeastern Pennsylvania. The other two 

 are abundant Coastal Plain forms which only occur in small or 

 moderate numbers in a few Piedmont localities. 



The Orthopteran fauna of the Piedmont is, with some not clearly 

 denned exceptions, monotonously uniform throughout. The only 

 subdivisions that I have in any degree been able to recognize are 

 habitat or ecological groups, and even these are not rigidly circum- 

 scribed, the transitions in environmental factors permitting an 

 extensive intermingling of the forms of one habitat with those of the 

 others. 



With these limitations in mind, I think we can recognize tentatively 

 three primary habitats or societies based upon the relative moisture 

 content of the substratum.'" These societies are respectively 



" In treating of the various epological subdivisions, I have in the main adaf>ted 

 the terminology introduced l)y Morse and Hancock, but have adopted a somewhat 

 different arraUKcment . Hotli of those authors primarily subdivide the Orthoptera 

 into ground-frequenting forms (Geophilous society of Morse, Geodytes of Han- 

 cock) and plant-frequenting types (Phytophiles of Morse, Phytodytes of Han- 

 cock). This subdivision is to me unsatisfactory Ijccause any natural habitat, 

 no matter how dry, will show some vegetation and tvill accordingly contain both 

 ground-frequenting and plant-frequenting types mingled together in hopeless 

 confusion. To me the best practice seems to be to follow that of the plant ecolo- 

 gists by basing our da.ssification of habitats or habitat-groups primarily upon the 

 available moisture content of the substratum. .Xs all collectors of insects know, 

 the fauna of a marsh is strikingly different from that of a dry barren. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 451 



xerophilous, mesophilous and hygrophilous. The xerophilous society 

 is characteristic of relatively dry situations. Morse" recognizes 

 three subdivisions or associations of this group, i.e., saxicolous or 

 rock-frequenting, arenicolous or sand-frequenting and humicolous 

 or those frequenting soils, loams especially, which although dry, 

 contain a larger percentage of moisture than the sands. The last 

 association naturally merges into the typical mesophilous society. 

 In the Piedmont only the humicolous association appears to be 

 represented and this is naturally not always easily separable from 

 the dominant mesophilous society. 



The xerophilous faunule is typically developed in the Piedmont 

 upon the so-called "poor soils." These soils occur on uplands and 

 steep hillsides where, owing to rain wash, the soil is either thin or 

 stony and therefore capable of supporting only a coarse type of 

 vegetation. In some cases the dryness of the ground is due to the 

 texture of soil and underlying rock which allows a relatively rapid 

 percolation of water, as on the ridges formed by the Chickies quartzite 

 and Stockton conglomerates, or to the chemical character of the soil, 

 as on the Conowingo or Serpentine Barrens. Where the woodlands 

 have been removed the vegetation on these areas is of a somewhat 

 open character, numerous bare patches of soil showing between the 

 more or less scattered plants. The dominant plant growth consists 

 of coarse herbaceous types, such as are typical of dry, waste land 

 (bunch-grasses, Andropogon spp., Panicum, etc., cinquefoU, sheep 

 sorrel, Rumex acetosella, blacklierry and wild rose bushes). In such 

 surroundings we normally encounter the following species of grass- 

 hoppers : 



OrphuleUa speciosa Dissosteira Carolina 



Arphia sulphurea Melanoplus atlanis 



" xanthoptera " femur-rubrum 



Chortophaga viridifasciata " minor 



Encoptolophus sordidus " femoratus 



Hippiscus tuberculatus Xiphidium strictum 



" Titgosiis 



Other species of more sporadic occurrence, but typical xerophiles, 

 are Eritettix carinatus, Pseudopomala brachyptera, and OrphuleUa 

 pelidna. 



Of the above species I would tentatively consider the following as 

 the more distinctively xerophilous: OrphuleUa speciosa, Arphia 



" Researches on North American Acridiidae, Carnegie Inst, of Washington, 

 Publication No. 18, 1904, p. 14.

sulphurea, Hippiscus tuberculatus, Hippiscus rugosus, Melanoplus 

 atlanis, Melanoplus minor and Xiphidiuni strictum. All of these 

 may, as I have noticed, occur in reduced numbers in mesophilous 

 habitats, so that they arc only predominantly xerophilous, not 

 absolutely so. 



Where woodlands prevail, in which mmierous small clearings occur, 

 a somewhat different phase of the xerophilous faunule obtains. 

 This, following ]\Iorse, we may call the sj'lvan phase in contradis- 

 tinction from the open country or campestral phase. The tree growth 

 in these relatively xerophytic habitats consists predominantly of 

 oaks (Q. alba. Q. ritbra, Q. velidina, Q. prinus), hickory, chestnut and 

 dogwood, with occasional groves of scrub pine (P. virginiana) and 

 red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). In the cleared portions of the 

 woods, where alone grasshoppers usually occur, a mixed growth of 

 grasses, vines and low shrubbery takes place. In such spots we 

 usually meet with the following Orthoptera: 



Orphulella .s/;ec/o.sa Melanoplus minor 



Arphia sulphurea Scudderia curvicauda 

 Chortophaga viridifasciata " furcata 



Hippi.-icus t uberculatus Amblycorypha oblongifolia 

 Dissosteira carolitia " rotundifolia 



Melanoplus scudderi Mia-ocenirum sp. 



" femur-rubrvm Atlanticus dorsalis 



In addition to these, we occasionally find associated with them, 

 sometimes in considerable numbers, the following species: 



Eritetti.t carinatus Melanoplus luridus 



Spharagemon bolli 



Rarely one meets with the following: 



P.seudopoin(d(i bracfvjptera Melanoplus tribulus 



Orphulella pelidna 



This woodland or sylvan faunuU^ is not always clearly distin- 

 guishable from the adjoining campestral faunule. There are all 

 transitions from the one type of habitat to the other. The clearing 

 away of the forests has extended the habitat of the campestral types. 

 As the trees arc thinned out the latter occupy the habitats originally 

 occupied by the sylvan forms, the latter either becoming extinct or 

 persisting locally where conditions are favoraljle. The more exclu- 

 sively woodland species in this region are Spharagemon bolli and Mel- 

 anoplus luridus. and both of these forms are, at present at least, 

 extremely local in their ilistribution in the Piedmont Region, though 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 453 



where conditions are favorable they are not uncommon. The other 

 woodland types are apparently better able to adapt themselves to 

 certain features of a campestral environment, such as the thicket 

 and scrub formations which tend to overrun waste lands. 



The mesophilous society is the dominant faunal group of the 

 Piedmont Region, especially as represented by its campestral phase. 

 This IS the faunule which one everywhere encounters in the rich 

 farming country, such as is typically found throughout the limestone 

 valleys. The prevailing vegetation consists of bright green succulent 

 grasses that form a firm sod. Roads, paths and plowed fields provide, 

 however, abundance of bare ground suitable for geophilous types. 



The campestral mesophile faunule typically yields the following 

 .species : 



Dichromorpha viridis Melanoplus femur-rubrum 

 Chortophngd viruUfasciata " femoratus 



Encoptolophus sordidus Cnnocephalus triops 



Dissosteira Carolina Orchelimum vidgare 



The sylvan phase of the mesophilous society is not always clearly 

 distinguishable from the campestral for the reason already mentioned. 

 It consists tj'pically of the following: 



Chortophaga viridifasciata Scudderia curvicauda 

 Melanoplus scudderi " furcata 



II fenur-rubrum Xipkidium brevipenne 

 femoratus 



As a sporadic member of this phase we may add Scudderia tcxensis. 



Hygrophilous Orthoptera inhabit areas of damp, moist or wet 

 soils. Of these we may, like Morse, distinguish two categories, 

 namely, humicolous hytlrophiles and paludicolous hydrophiles. The 

 former are frequenters of areas in which the soil, though usually 

 damp, is normally not wet or soggy. The latter inhabit tracts which 

 are actually wet. In the Piedmont there is no hard-and-fast line 

 separating these two groups. As already mentioned, hygrophilous 

 habitats in the Piedmont Region are of extremely restricted extent, 

 owing to the very perfect drainage of the whole region. 



The campestral phase of the humicolous hygrophiles is typically 

 represented by the fauna of the open grassy meadows which in many 

 places liorder the streams. The soil of these meadows is usually 

 a fine, alluvial clay-loam corresponding approximately to the I.ickdale 

 clay-loam of the Bureau of Soils. The vegetation "is dominated bv 

 succulent grasses, which are extensively utilized for pasture. Asso- 




454 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



ciated with the grasses is a large variety of other plants, among 

 which we may mention buttercups {Ranunculus bulbosus), quaker- 

 ladies {Hoiistonia cwrulea), spring-beauty (Claytonia virginica), 

 golden ragwort {Senicio aureus), cynthia (Adopogon virginicum), 

 elder (Sainbucus canadensis), iron-weed (Vernonia noveboracensis)) 

 blue vervain (Verbena hastata), ioe-pye weed (Eupatoriun purpureum, 

 and boneset {Eupaiorium perfoliatum). 



The Orthoptera inhabiting these meadowlands and pastures include 

 regularly the following species: 



Dichromorpha riridis Scudderia furcaia 



CJiortophuga viridifasciata Conocephalus triops 



Melanoplus Jemur-rubrum ' Orchelhnum vulgare 



" femoraius Xiphidium fasciatum 



Scudderia curvicauda " brevipenne 



Scudderia texensis is an occasional member of this faunule. 



This faunule includes no peculiar types, but is chiefly distinguished 

 from the mesophilous by the absence of the more geophihjus forms) 

 and by the proportionately much greater numbers of the hygrophilous 

 species, such as D. viridis, C. triops, 0. vulgare and X. fasciatum. 



A slightly different phase of the humicolous hygrophilous society 

 is found in open woodland occupying damp or slightly moist depres- 

 sions marking usually the head-waters of some rivulet. The Orthop- 

 tera occurring in such places consist of the following species: 



ChlceaUis coJispersa (local) * Scucjderia furcata 

 Melanoplus femur-rubntm Orchelimum vulgare 



" fcntorutus Xiphidium brevipenne 



Scudderia curvicauda 



Paludicolous Orthoptera arc the swamp dwellers. In the Pied- 

 mont swamps are of relati\'cly small extent and are most commonly 

 represented by local depressions in the meadowlands where the 

 water-table is normally so close to the surface that the latter is kept 

 permanently moist or even covered with water. In these swamps the 

 vegetation consists of a inixtui'e of succulent grasses — e.g., Homalo- 

 cenchrus oryzoides — and sedges among which species of Carex are 

 prominent, especially the tussock sedge {C. stricta). Such locations 

 constitute the favorite habitat of such Orthoptera as Stenobothrus 

 rurtipennis and Orchelimum spinidosum, which api)ear to l)e the only 

 ]ialudicolous forms represented in the Piedmont. Owing to the 

 small size of the swamps, Orthoptera from the adjoining drier lands 

 frequently invade them, making it difficult to clearly discriminate 

 this faunule from the meadow faunule.

IV. The Coastal Plain. 



The Coastal Plain includes all of the country south and east of the 

 fall-line. It consists essentially of a low pls-in of very slight relief 

 and hence, for most of its extent, at least, of very imperfect drainage. 

 This is especially true of that portion east and south of the range of 

 low hills marking the divide between the Delaware and Atlantic 

 drainage systems. In this part the seaward slope is exceedingly 

 gradual and consequently the stream flow is very sluggish and the 

 drainage very inadequate, resulting in the formation of extensive 

 bogs. West of the divide the stream gradient is considerably greater, 

 so that this part, constituting the Delaware Valley or Middle Dis- 

 trict of Stone, is on the whole fairly well drained, though in their 

 lower courses the streams are so near tide-level that they become 

 very sluggish and form wide mud-flats through which the streams 

 tortuously meander. 



The all but universal soil of the Coastal Plain is a coarse sand 

 corresponding approximately to the Norfolk sand of the Bureau of 

 Soils. Associated with this are frequent areas of coarse gravel 

 similar to the Sassafras gravelly loam of the same Bureau.'- East 

 of the Delaware-Atlantic divide these sands and gravels form a 

 practically unbroken cover, but west of that line, in the Middle 

 District, they are frequenth^ interrupted by more or less extensive 

 areas of clays and loams, some of which are due to the exposure of 

 the underlying Cretaceous and Miocene deposits consequent upon 

 the removal by erosion of the original capping of sand and gravel. 

 In consequence of this variety of soil types, the Middle District is 

 characterized by a greater diversity of flora and fauna than the 

 remaining subdivisions of the New Jersey Coastal Plain. 



The two general features in which the Coastal Plain most markedly 

 differs from the Piedmont Region are: (1) the almost universal 

 presence of coarse sands, and (2) the development of extensive tracts 

 of permanently wet areas. With these is correlated the prevalence 

 of two widely different types of fauna, a xerophilous fauna charac- 

 teristic of the sandy districts and a hygrophilous fauna characteristic 

 of the bogs and marshes. The mesophilous fauna is of relatively 

 limited extent, being fully represented only on the clay and loamy 

 soils of the Middle District, but tending to spread into the other

As indicated earlier in this ])ai)cr, the Coastal Plain fauna is marie 

 up of representatives of four primary regional faunules, namely, 

 Appalachian, Piedmont, Coastal and Pine Barren. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 457 



The Appalachian faunule is represented by a few types that recur 

 locally or in diminished numbers in the Coastal Plain, such as Scud- 

 deria pistillata, S. septentrionalis, Conocephalus ensiger and Xiphidium 

 saltans. 



The Piedmont faunule include species whose local centre of dis- 

 tribution is in the Piedmont, but which occur in smaller numbers or 

 locally in the Coastal Plain. To this group I would refer the following 

 species : 



Dichromorpha viridis Encoptolophus sordidus 



Orphulella speciosa Melanoplus minor 



Stenobothnis curtipennis 



This faunule is best represented in the Middle District, to which, 

 indeed, two of the species, D. viridis and E. sordidus, appear to be 

 entirely confined, or at most barely enter the other districts. The 

 other three species have been taken throughout, but only in widely 

 separated localities and usually in very small numbers. 



IV (a). The Coastal Subdivision or District. 



The Coastal faunule is typical of the marshes and low forelands 

 bordering the ocean, the lower portions of the Delaware River and 

 all tidal estuaries. Of this faunule we can distinguish several minor 

 components of an ecological nature, each of which is characteristic 

 of some well-defined physiographic feature of the region. 



As is well known, the coast of New Jersey is formed by a succession 

 of long, narrow sand-spits heaped up by wind and wave. These 

 are the coast-islands or Ijarrier-beaches, all of which in New Jersey 

 are fast being transformed into summer resorts. Back of the barrier- 

 beaches come the salt marshes, low grassy flats daily inundated by 

 the tide. Bej'ond these, rising very gradually out of the marshes, 

 comes the mainland. A narrow strip of the mainland immediately 

 bordering the salt marshes has different faunal and floral characteristics 

 from those of the interior — a difference first recognized by Stone, who 

 has called it the Coastal Strip. The Coastal Strip is similar in every 

 essential respect to the low forelands bordering the maritime marshes 

 of the Delaware River and Bay. 



In the Coa.stal District I recognize the following ecological groups: 

 (1) the Subcoastal; (2) the Littoral or Dune; (3) the Submaritime, 

 and (4) the Maritime. 



The Subcoastal group is characteristic of the Coastal Strip, more 

 especially of its drier portions. It is very rich in species, due doubt- 

 less to the diversity of conditions consequent upon the transition 




458 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [JunC, 



from a dry, sandy upland to the low, marshy areas bordering the salt 

 marshes. The soil throughout is a coarse sand similar to the Norfolk 

 type. In the more elevated areas it may be quite dry at the surface, 

 but is usually underlaid at no great depth by the water-table. The 

 sand is very porous, but its proximity to underground water makes 

 it a good corn and truck soil, as a result of which it has been exten- 

 sively cleared and cultivated. Where the surface of the sand ap- 

 proaches within a foot or so of permanent water-level it is often 

 highly impregnated with organic matter, and in such cases assumes 

 the character of a sandy loam. 



Most of the Coastal Strip is of the open campestral type, though 

 groves and thickets of limited extent are frequent in the shallow 

 depressions leading down to the salt marshes. Where the fields are 

 not cultivated they soon become overrun with native and introduced 

 weeds and bushes, among which we may mention such forms as the 

 tall bunch-grasses of the genus Andwpogon, timothy {Phleum 

 pratense), sand-bur {Cetichrus cawJinianus), Juncus tenuis, species of 

 smart-weed {Polygonum), Sclerantlius annuus, bayberry [Myrica 

 caroliniensis, beach plum {Prunus maritima) , wild indigo {Baptisia 

 tindoria), sensitive pea {Cassia nictitans and chama-crista), bush- 

 clovers {Lcspedeza spp.), low evening primrose {CEnothera laciniata), 

 butterfly-weed {Asdepias tuberosa), blue toad-flax {Linaria canaden- 

 sis), horse-mint {Monarda pundata), low cynthia (Adopogon caro- 

 linianum), rag-weed {Ambrosia arlemiifolia), black-eye susan {Ru- 

 bedcia hirta), white boneset {^upatoriwn album, etc.), golden aster 

 {Chrysopis mariaiia), and goldenrods {SoUdago and Euthamnia spp.)- 



This vegetation is evidently of a mild xerophytic t^-pe. The 

 Orthoptera associated with it may therefore be regarded as a xe- 

 rophilous faunule of the humicolous subtype and campestral station. 

 To this faunule I would refer the following species: 



Syrbula admirahilis Melanoplus atlanis 

 Eriteilix cnrinalus " femur-rubruin 



OrphuhUa pelidna " femorutus 



Arphia sulphurea Scudderia texensis 

 " xanthoptera " furcata 



Chortophaga viridifasciata Amblycorypha oblongifolia 

 Hippiscus phcenicopkrus " uhleri 



" rugosus Microcentrum sp. 



Dissosteira Carolina Concephalus robustus 

 Trimerotropis 7naritima " triops 



Psiriidia fenestralis Orchelimum rulgare 



Schistocerca americana Xiphidium stridum 

 " damnifica " saltans 



Melanoplus scudderi 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 459 



The most abundant species is Melanoplus femur-rubrum, which 

 literally swarms in the low, weedy fields and pastures just above the 

 salt meadows, but is somewhat less frequent in the drier uplands, 

 where it is almost equalled in numbers by such forms as Melanoplus 

 atUinis and OrphuleUa pelidna. Other common species of this 

 faunule are Arphia xanthopfera, Chortophaga viridifasciata, Dissos- 

 teira Carolina, Psuiidia fenestralis, Scudderia texensis, Orchelimum 

 vulgare and Xiphidiuni strictum. 



Frequent, but not especially common, species are Syrbida admir- 

 abilis, Hippiscus rugosus, Melanoplus femoratus, Scudderia f areata . 

 both species of Amblycorypha, Conocephalus robustus and triops. 



Frequent locally, particularly in.thicketed areas and along the 

 borders of woodlands, are such species as Arphia sulphurea, Hippiscus 

 phoenicopterus, Sckistocerca damnifica, and Melanoplus scudderi. 

 These seem to be essentially sylvan types, which in the Coastal 

 District succeed in holding their own in the locations mentioned. 



The following members of the Suljcoastal faunule appear to be 

 rare or very exceptional : Erileitix carinatiis, Trimerotropis maritima , 

 Schistoeerca americana and Xiphidimn saltans. 



The Littoral or, more properly. Dune group is characteristic of 

 the higher, drier parts of the beaches. As already mentioned, these 

 beaches are formed of sand heaped up by the combined action of 

 wind, wave and tide. In southern New Jersey, where I am most 

 familiar with them, they all present the same physiographic features. 

 On the ocean side there is the beach or strand, consisting of two 

 portions, a lower beach covered regularly daily by the tide and 

 totally devoid of all vegetation, and an upper beach, which is only 

 covered at intervals, as during severe storms. The upper beach 

 normally consists of dry, white quartz sand. It is largely bare, but 

 supports an open growth of several plants, the most abundant and 

 characteristic of which is the sea-rocket, Cakile edentula, other 

 frequent associates being Salsola kali and Ammodenia peploides. 

 Above the upper beach comes the outer or frontal dune and back of 

 it and extending to the salt meadows stretches a variable series of 

 minor dunes with intervening depressions, many of which are deep 

 enough to reach to and expose the underlying marsh mud. The 

 frontal dune is dominated by a nearly pure growth of the sand-binding 

 grass, Ammophila arenaria, which also constitutes the dominant 

 vegetation for several rods back of the frontal dune, but is gradually 

 replaced on more leeward dune areas by a mixed growth, consisting 

 of such forms as Andropogon littoralis, several species of Panicum, 




460 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



Cenchrus tribuloides, species of Cyperus and Carex, sand-myrtle, 

 Hudsonia tomentosa, and prickly-pear cactus, Opuntia opuntia. Fur- 

 ther back these are replaced by the bayberry, Myrica cai-olinensis, 

 thicket formation. This extends close to the edge of the salt marsh, 

 but is separated from the latter by a usually narrow zone consisting 

 chiefly of Iva oraria and Baccharis halimifolia, the distinctive salt- 

 marsh border plants. The dune depressions harbor a hydrophytic 

 flora similar to that characteristic of the Submaritime zone. 



The chief distinguishing features of the Orthopteran fauna of the 

 beaches are positively the abundance of Trimerotropis maritima, the 

 presence of a peculiar race or possibly species of Schistocerca and the 

 relative frequency of Schistocerca americana; negatively the absence 

 or scarcity of several mainland species. 



The following list gives all the species which to my knowledge 

 have been taken or recorded from the beaches, excepting, however, 

 all forms that I regard as more properly belonging to the Submari- 

 time faunule. 



Orphidella speciosa Schistocerai sp. cf. obscura 



" pelidna Melanoplus femur-rubruin 

 Chortophaga viridifasciata " femoratus 



Hippiscu.'i phaenicopierus Scudderia texensis 

 Dissosteira Carolina " furcata 



Trimerotropis maritima Conocephalus robustus 

 Psinidia fenestralis " triops 



Scirletica marmorata _ Orchelimum vulgare 



Schistocerca americana Xiphidium strictum 



There is a close correspondence between the distribution of Orthop- 

 tera on the beaches and that of the vegetation already referred to. 

 On the outermost dunes in the Ammophila arenaria areas Trimero- 

 tropis maritima abounds to the almost total exclusion of other .species. 

 Further back, where the Ammophila begins to be replaced by a mixed 

 vegetation, the Trimerotropis gradually l)ecomes reduced in numbers, 

 its place being taken by such species as Psinidia fenestralis and 

 Dissosteira Carolina, both of which are abundant on bare sandy spots. 

 The vegetation in this zone is a very open one and consetiuently 

 there are numerous exposed areas of dry sand on which these forms 

 delight to rest. Still further back from the .sea we come to the 

 i)ayberry thickets in which the peculiar maritime species or variety 

 of Schislocei-a is of frequent occurrence. This form of the genus is 

 apparently restricted to the beaches. In coloration it closely resem- 

 bles S. nibiginosa of inland districts, but is always much larger, and, 

 as Mr. Rehn has suggested to me. may represent a non-striped race 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 461 



of iS. obscura just as rubiginosa may be a similar phase of S. alutacea. 

 Where the bayberry formation is more open, the grassy tracts 

 extending about and between the bushes abound in Melanoplus 

 femiir-rubrum and Orphulella pelidna, while associated with them are 

 much smaller, but not inconsiderable numbers of Orchelimum vulgare, 

 Scudderia texensis, Cotiocephalus robustus and, locally at least, 

 Schistocerca americana. Along the edges of the salt meadows and 

 about the dune depressions these forms meet and more or less inter- 

 mingle with the .Submaritime species. 



At the present time it is difficult to decide which of the species 

 given in the above list are indigenous to the islands and which have 

 been secondarily introduced through human agency. There can be 

 no doubt that human occupancy by destroying primitive conditions, 

 introducing artificial conditions and establishing railroads, turnpikes 

 and other avenues of connnunication with the mainland has effected 

 and is still effecting far-reaching changes in the faunal and floral 

 features of the islands. The clearing away of the bayberry thickets 

 over large tracts and the levelling of the dunes into building lots, 

 together with the importation of gravel from the mainland, have 

 resulted in the introduction of the common grasses and weeds of the 

 mainland, with the result that near all thickly populated parts the 

 vegetation is almost exclusively of the weedland type. In such 

 places one regularly meets such Orthoptera as Melanoplus Jemur- 

 rubruin. Chortophaga viridifasciata, Dissosteira Carolina, and Orcheli- 

 mum vulgare. 



Certain species, common on the neighboring mainland, are so 

 rare or exceptional on the beaches that there can l)e little doul)t that 

 they represent quite recent introductions. Among these we may 

 mention Hippiscus phaenicopterus (1 individual taken in a vacant 

 lot at Sea Isle City, apparently the only instance of its occurrence 

 on the beaches), Melanoplus femoratus (a few taken at Anglesea), 

 Conocephalus triops (1 taken on Seven-mile Beach) and Xiphidium 

 slrictum (1 each from Avalon and Cape May). Two additional 

 species apparently very rare on the beaches are Scirtetica marmorata 

 and Scudderia furcata. It is doubtful whether these last two forms 

 are recent introductions or relicts from a time when the islands were 

 more extensively wooded. My own specimens of these forms from 

 the beaches came from Seven- and Five-mile Beaches, both of which 

 were until recently extensively wooded. 



I have never seen Orphulella speciosa on any of the beaches, but 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has several examples 




462 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



from Anglesea, the only knowTi instance, I believe, of the occurrence 

 of this species in the Coastal District. 



The Submaritime group characterizes the narrow zone which 

 marks the transition from salt marsh to sandy upland. The soil of 

 this zone is a silt darkened by organic matter. Normally it is quite 

 damp, but, except in the more depressed areas where the ground is 

 soggy, it forms a firm sod due to the interlacing rootlets of the thick 

 vegetation which covers it. The Submaritime zone evidently marks 

 the line along which the seepage of fresh water takes place from the 

 mainland. Chemical analysis of the water from the same zone at 

 Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, showed it to be entirely fresh,'' 

 though salt water occasionally invades the zone at the highest tides 

 or during severe storms. The dominant vegetation consists of a 

 mixed growth of Spartina patens and Juncus gerardi on the firmer 

 areas and of a nearly pure growth of Scirpus americanus in the wet 

 depressions. Other plants more or less frequent in this zone are 

 Echinochloa ivalteri, Distichlis spicata, Scirpus olneyi and robustus. 

 Dondia maritima, Tissa marina, Kosteletzkya virginica, Ptilimnium 

 capiUaceum, Sabatia stellaris, Asclepias lanceolata, Gerardia purpurea 

 and tnaritima, Pluchea camphorata, Iva oraria and Baccharis halimi- 

 JoUa. 



The Orthopteran faunule of the Submaritime zone is especially 

 distinguished by the abundance of Clinocephalus elegans, which 

 frequents the Spartina patens-Juncus gerardi areas, and of Orcheli- 

 mum herbaceum, which is partial to the patches of Scirpus americanus. 

 The entire faunule includes the following species: 



Tryxalis brevicornis Conocephalus nebrascensis 

 Pseudopomala brachyptera " caudellianus 



Mermiria vigiluns " palustris 



Clinocephalus elegans " fuscostriatus (?) 



Chlwaltis cn7isper,sa Orchelimum herbaceum 

 Melanoplns femur-rubrum " spinulosum 



Paroxya floridiana Xiphidium fasciatum 

 Cunocephalus lyristes " spartince 



" exiliscanorus 



Of these species the most abundant in the Submaritime zone is 

 Melanoplus femur-rubrum. Next to it in point of numbers comes 

 Xiphidium fasciatum. Other abimdant species are Clinocephalus 

 elegans, Paroxya floridiana and Orchelimum herbaceum. Locally 

 Tryxalis brevicornis is common in the Scirpus areas. The remaining

1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 463 



species are much less frequent, though such forms as Conocephalus 

 lyristes and caudellianus and Orchelimum spinulosum are not un- 

 common. Pseudopomala brachyptera and Chlaaltis conspersa are 

 both very exceptional and, when found, are usually in close proximity 

 to Iva oraria thickets. Mermina vujilans has been taken regularly 

 only m the vicmity of Cape May City and rarely in other localities 

 in Cape May County, but not, so far as I am aware, outside of that 

 county. Conocephalus fuscostriatus was taken once by Mr Henry 

 Fowler near Cape Maj- Point. Xiphidium spartince is not infrequent 

 in the Spartina patens areas, but is to be regarded as a stray from 

 the true Maritime faunule rather than as a regular member of the 

 present faunule. 



The Maritime faunule occurs in the true salt marshes. The soil 

 in these marshes is a soft, gelatinous muck or ooze containing a 

 relatively high amount of salt. In spite of its softness, the greater 

 part of the salt marsh is quite firm, owing to the thick covering of 

 coarse grasses, the interlacing roots of which bind the soft material 

 into a tough sod. The vegetation of the salt marsh consists of an 

 almost pure growth of the characteristic salt marsh-grass, Spartina 

 strica { = glabra). Of this there are two varieties easily recognizable 

 in the New Jersey salt marshes. The more common variety is a 

 short form that covers the fiat areas away from and between the 

 waterways; the other a much taller variety that forms reed-like 

 growths along the tidal creeks and ditches which traverse the marshes 

 in every direction. Wet sandy areas not occupied by the grass are 

 frequently characterized by an open growth of salt-worts, Salicornia 

 europa>a, biglovii and ambigua. The only other plant that is at all 

 conspicuous m the salt marsh is the sea-lavender, Limonium caroli- 

 num, which is of frequent .occurrence throughout the flats covered 

 with the short variety of Spartina. 



The Orthoptera of the salt marsh form a very distinct faunule 

 In the short variety of Spartina occur large numbers of Orphulella 

 olwacea and Xipkidiimi spartince, while the tall variety along the 

 waterways is characterized by Orchelimum fididnium and Xiphidium 

 nigropleuroides, both of which occur there in abundance, especially 

 the former. In addition to these, both varieties of the grass harbor 

 moderate numbers of Conocephalus lyristes. 



The Maritime or true salt-marsh faunule thus contains the fol- 

 lowing grasshoppers : 



Orphulella olivacea Xiphidium spartince 



Conocephalus lyristes " nigropleusroide 



Orchelimum jidicinium

IV (b). The Pine Barren District. 



The Pine Barren Faunule is the fourth primary faiinal group 

 represented in the Coastal Plain. It is typically developed in the 

 sandy barrens lying between the Delaware-Atlantic divide and the 

 Coastal Strip. As already mentioned, this is a region of exceedingly 

 slight relief, the surface sloping almost imperceptibly toward the 

 ocean. The surface, however, is not entirely flat, but is more or less 

 gently undulating, the hollows being occupied by the cedar liogs 

 which form a highly characteristic physiographic feature of the 

 district. The all but universal soil is a coarse sand similar in character 

 to the Norfolk and Winsor sands of the Bureau of Soils. In places 

 the sand contains many pebbles and these may become such an 

 important constituent of the soil that it becomes a gravel similar 

 in essential respects to the Sassafras gravelly loam. In very dry 

 situations, where there is very little plant cover, the sand has a 

 decidedly bleached appearance, but the subsoil is always of a deeper 

 color, usually a pale orange or buff tint. In damper spots, where the 

 plant covering is thicker, the sand usually has a dark gray or even 

 black tint, due to the accumulation of organic debris. 



The vegetation of the Pine Barrens is of a decidedly xerophytic 

 aspect, owing to the coarse texture of the sand which allows the ready 

 percolation of water. Most of the region is forested, the dominant 

 trees on the sands and gravels being the pitch pine, Pinns rigida, 

 and several oaks, especially black-jack pak, Quercus marylamiica, 

 scrub oak, Q. ilicifoUa, post oak, Q. steJlaia, and scrub chestnut oak, 

 Q. prinoides. Practically all of the timber at the present time is of 

 secondary growth, the region having been cut over repeatedl>' ami 

 frequently swept by destructive forest fires. The woods are accord- 

 ingly of a rather open character, the taller trees being nmch scattered, 

 but usually with a dense undergrowth of oak and pine saplings, the 

 former predominating. Where this undergrowth is not too thick, 

 there aix* associated with thesevarious smaller shrubs, such as bracken- 

 fern {Pteridium aquilinum), sweet-fern (Comptonia asplenifolia), 

 wild indigo (Bopti.sia tinctoria), mountain laurel (Kulmia latiMla) 

 and blueberries {Vaccinium vaciUans; and (knjlusaacui bacaita). 

 Where clearings have been made varying conditions prevail according 

 to the stage of reforestation reached. In very dry. exposed situations 

 the sand, exposed to wind action, may remain bare for a long time, 

 giving rise to formations similar to the "blow-outs" of the Middle 

 West. Gradually, however, a low, mat-like vegetation, composed 

 of such forms as reindeer-moss {('ladunia s]).), sandwort {Ai'enaria 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 465 



carolimana), wild ipecac {Euphorbia ipecacuanhce) , Hudsonia ericoides 

 sand myrtle {Dendrium buxifolium) , arbutus (Epi-jwa repen.<^) and 

 pyxie iPyxidanihem barbulata), takes possession and following or 

 accompanying these are bunch-grasses, like the Andropogons and 

 rosette grasses mostly of the genus Panicu7n {P. commonsianmn 

 addisoni , columbianum, etc.) . These prepare the way for a low shrub 

 vegetation of blueberries and associated plants. 



The bogs of the Pine Barrens are the results, as already mentioned 

 of the imperfect drainage of the region. The rain-water from the 

 sands passes by seepage into the depressions and there accumulates 

 until It finds an outlet into one of the general tlrainage systems 

 Owmg to the low relief of the country, the water never accumulates 

 to any great depth and is consequently choked by a luxuriant vegeta- 

 tion of a typical peat-bog aspect. Originally, especially in the wetter 

 parts of the bogs, the dominant tree was the white cedar, Chamcecy- 

 paris thyoides, whence the term cedar-bog so frequently applied to 

 the Pme Barren bogs. In many swamps, however, this tree has been 

 largely removed and its place taken by a mixed groAvth, of which the 

 dominant tree is the red maple, Acer rubrum. Along with this are 

 large numbers of sour-gum, Nyssa sylratica, and swamp magnolia 

 M. mrgmiana. Beneath these is usually a dense undergrowth of 

 tall shrubs like clammy azalea, Azalea viscosa, sweet pepper bush 

 Clqthra alnifoUa, high bush-huckleberry, Vaccimum corymbosum 

 and withe-rod. Viburnum nudum. Where the taller vegetation is 

 not too dense there is a lower undergrowth of cinnamon fern (Osmunda 

 cmnaviomea), royal fern {Osmunda regalis), chain fern {Woodwardia 

 virgimca) chokeberry {Aronia arbutifolia) , inkberry {Ilex glabra) 

 and such ericaceous shrubs as leucothoe (L. racemosa), privet 

 andromeda {Xohsma ligudrina) and Cassandra {Chamiedaphne 

 calyculata). In still more open places, where the shrubby growth 

 has been cut away, a varied herbaceous growth prevails consisting 

 predominantly of chain fern {Woodwardia virgimca) and certain tall 

 species of sedges and rushes {Eleocharis spp., Rhynchospora alba, 

 Enophorum mrgimcum, Juncus canadensis, J. dichotomus, J. acumi- 

 natus, J. effusus, etc.). Cushions of bog-moss {Sphagnum spp.) 

 are frequent about the bases of these plants and in these grow se^'eral 

 species of sundew {Drosera). Other plants not infrequent in these 

 places are swamp pink (Helonias bullata), white fringed orchid 

 (Blephangloitis blephariglottis), rosepogonia {Pogonia ophioglossoides) , 

 grass-pink {Limodorum tuberosum) and the cranberry {Oxy coccus 

 macrocarpon) .

 represent the two native Pine Barren types of environment, there 

 is a minor third type consequent upon the operations of man. Where 

 the country is cleared and settled and the land placed under cultiva- 

 tion, conditions are produced which favor a fauna and flora essentially 

 like that prevailing in the Delaware Valley and Coastal districts. 

 In such places a weedy type of vegetation predominates, characterized 

 Ijj' forms common in the low-lying sandy areas of those districts, 

 among which we may mention the following: Syntherisma san- 

 guinalis, Phleuin pratense, Chcetochloa viridis, Cenchrus carolinianus, 

 Sisymbrium officinale, Draba verna, Trifolium arvcnsc, T. -pratense, 

 T. procumbens, Melilotus officinalis, Cassia niditans, Strophostyles 

 helvola, Asclepias tuberosa, Monarda punctata, Verbascum thapsus, 

 Linaria canadensis, Plantago lanceolata, Specularia perfoliata, 

 A mbrosia artemisii folia. 



There are thus three types of habitat characteristic of the Pine 

 Barrens, i.e., (1) the sand barrens; (2) the peat bogs; (3) the cul- 

 tivated areas. Each of these is distinguished by certain peculiarities 

 of flora and fauna. 



The entire grasshopper fauna of the Pine Barrens (exclusive of 

 the groups not considered in this paper) includes, to my knowledge, 

 the following .species. Some of these are referred to this fauna with 

 a query, owing to the fact that all records of their capture are clese 

 to the borders of the Pine Barrens, a fact indicative of the possibility 

 of their being merely stragglers from the adjoining districts.

The species in the following list appear from availal)le records to 

 be of only very infrequent or exceptional occurrence in the Pine 

 Barrens, and are evidently stragglers or invaders from the Delaware 

 Valley, Coastal or Cape May Districts. Certain of these forms, 

 however, may occur in fair numl)ers in places much modified by 

 human angency.

As previously mentioned, we distinguish three types of Pine 

 Barren habitats, each of which is characterized by certain well- 

 defined ])eculiariti('s of moisture, sulistratum and flora. Correlated 

 with these we have e(|ually well-marked differences in the Orthopteran 

 faunule of each habitat. 



The Orthopteran faunule of the Sand Barrens is a markedly 

 xerophilous one, this being especially true of those forms that inhabit 

 bare, open stretches of clear, white sand. In such places the dominant 

 species are the geophilous arenicoles, Sdrtetica mnrmoraln and 

 Psinidia fenestralis, while associateil with them are usually smaller, 

 but considerable, numbers of Spharagemon wyomingianuiii anil very 

 rarely a few examples of Trimerotropis maritima. Where the sand

has become covered with a low open bhieberry scrub, numerous 

 additional species are of frequent occurrence, such as Melanoplus 

 luridus, Spharagemon bolli, Orphiilella pelidna, Hippiscus phaenicop- 

 terus, Dissosteira Carolina, Melanoplus fasciatus, and M. impudicus. 

 In higher and denser scrub, such as is formed by a mixture of blue- 

 berry bushes and oak saplings, the more strictly arenicolous types 

 become infrecjuent, while sylvan types Ijecome dominant. Among 

 these we may mention as especially frequent the following: Melano- 

 plus luridus, Spharagemon bolli, Schistocerca rubiginosa, Melanoplus 

 impudicus, Melanoplus scudderi, Melanoplus fasciatus, Scudderia 

 curvicauda and Scudderia fur cata. The typical Sand Barrens faunule, 

 taken as a whole, consists of the following species: 



Orphulella pelidna Melanoplus scudderi 

 Arphia sulphurea " fasciatus 



Hippiscus phaenicopterus " tribulus 



Dissosteira Carolina " impudicus 



Spharagemon bolli " luridus 



" wyomingianum " femoratus

 Scirtetica marinorata " furcata 



Schistocerca damnifica Amblycorypha oblongifolia 



" rubiginosa '' rotundifolia 



Hesperotettix brevipennis Microcentrum sp. 



Belonging to this faunule, but usually rare and local in distribu- 

 tion, are the following: 



Eritettix carinatus Melanoplus stonei 

 Trimerotropis maritima " punctulatus 



Dendrotettix quercus Orchelimum minor 



Melanoplus minor Xiphidi'um brevipenne 



In the more extensive clearings, such, for example, as the fire- 

 breaks along the railroads, where the scrub growth is short and quite 

 open with considerable grassy areas intermixed, a campestral-like 

 modification of the Sand Barren faunule takes place, characterized 

 by the presence of large numbers of species typical of the Coastal 

 District. The more abundant of these apparently secondary species 

 are Melanoplus atlanis, Arphia xanthoptera, Chortophaga viridifasciata 

 and Melanoplus femoratus. With these are the usual typical Pine 

 Barren species. 



The Peat Bog faunule of the Pine Barrens is usually typified b.y 

 the following species of Orthoptera: Schistocerca aiutacea, Paroxya 

 scudderi, Orchelimum glaberrimum, erythrocephalum and pulchellum. 

 As rare or occasional constituents we may mention Chloealtis conspersa, 




470 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



Sienobothrus curtipennis, Mecostethus lineatus, Clinocephalus elegans, 

 Paroxya floridinna , Orchdimmn vulgare, 0. spinulosum and Xiphidium 

 Jasciatum. Mermiria vigilans I took once in a rather open bog at 

 Belle Plain along the southern edge of the Pine Barrens. All of these 

 species are most frequent in the more open, well-lighted parts of the 

 bogs. In the densely wooded parts they are absent or exceedingly 

 scarce. 



In cleared and cultivated districts a type of faunule occurs which 

 in essential respects resembles the Subcoastal faunule of the Coastal 

 District. This faunule is characterized bj' the dominance of Melano- 

 plus femur-riibrum, a grasshopper that is remarkedly exceptional in 

 the less disturbed portions of the Pine Barrens, as Rehn has pointed 

 out. Common associates of this species in the settled parts of the 

 Barrens are Dissosteira Carolina, OrphuleUa pelidna, Melaunphis 

 atlanis, Arphia xanthoptera, Chortophaga viridijasciata and Melnnoplus 

 femoratus. IVIuch less frequent and, on the whole, rather local forms 

 appear to lie svich species as Conocephohis robuMiis, C. triops. Orcheli- 

 7uum vulgare, Xiphidium stridum, Amblycorypha uhleri and Hippit^cus 

 rugosus. This faunule is most typically represented in old and 

 neglected fields well overrun with weedy vegetation. 



IV (c). The Middle District or Delaware Valley. 



As already mentioned, I am not disposed to consider the Middle 

 District of the Coastal Plain as having the same faunal value as the 

 Coastal and Pine Barren Districfts. It contains no distinctive species 

 of Orthoptora. its claim to recognition as a separate Orthopteran 

 faunal province being based solely upon the intermingling of 

 faunules which in the other districts rarely or never intermingle 

 and the absence of certain of the more distinctive Pine Barren tyi)es. 



The Middle District includes all that part of New Jersey which 

 lies south of the fall-line and west and north of the Delaware-Atlantic 

 Divide, together with the more hilly districts of northern Coastal 

 Plain New Jer.sey and a narrow strip of relatively low land in Penn.syl- 

 vania bordering the Delaware River south of Trenton. As Stone 

 has shown, this part of Pennsylvania has many distinctive Coastal 

 Plain plants. . A similar agreement is to be seen in the Urthoptcra, 

 especially in those inhabiting the marshes. 



This striji of Coastal Plain country in Pennsylvania has so many 

 characteristics differentiating it from the more ty])ical Coastal Plain 

 as exemplified in New Jersey that it requires separate consideration. 

 It represents a series of successive flood-plains of the Delaware River, 




■'^l'*-] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 471 



each of which is separated from the next succeeding one by a low- 

 escarpment or terrace. The youngest of these is practically on a 

 level with the river and forms a strip of marshland varying in width 

 from a fraction of a mile to three or four miles. The most typical 

 representative of this level is the well-known Tinicum Marshes 

 immediately south of Philadelphia. In physiographic and floristic 

 features these marshes bear a close resemblance to the undrained, 

 open bottomlands of the Central States. Except where ditched 

 and diked, these marshes are permanently covered with water backed 

 up by the tide. They support a luxuriant growth of hydrophytic 

 gr isses and sedges. The soil is a rich, dark muck, the dark color 

 being due to the decay of the marsh vegetation. 



Back of these river marshes is a terrace, about forty feet in height, 

 which marks the border of a level tract corresponding to an earlier 

 stage of deposition (Cape May Stage). A still earlier stage is repre- 

 sented by a second terrace a mile or two further away from the river 

 (.Pensauken Stage). This extends back to the escarpment that 

 marks the position of the fall-line. The deposits forming these 

 terraces are alluvial in origin and consist of light-colored gravels and 

 clay loams essentially similar in appearance and texture to the 

 typical Piedmont soils. The soil is quite fertile and is extensively 

 cultivated, so that the region consists mostly of open fields anil 

 pastures. 



The Orthoptera of these upland terraces are, with two e.xceptions, 

 common Piedmont types, so that from the standpoint of their grass- 

 hopper fauna these terraces are a part of' the Piedmont. The two 

 exceptions are Orphulella pelidna and Melanoplus differentialis, the 

 former of which I have found to be locally quite frequent along the 

 edge of the lower terrace, as at Bartram's Gardens, but it is not 

 quite as common or as evenly distributed as its congener, 0. speciosa. 

 which is a typical Piedmont species. Melanoplus differentialis is in 

 a class by itself. It appears to have been introducetl from the West. 

 It is now abundant in the low lands bordering the Delaware River 

 and frequently migrates from them to the neighboring uplands. 



One Piedmont species has never, so far as I am aware, been recorded 

 from these terraces. I refer to Hippiscus iuherculatus. 



In the following list I give the species of grasshoppers, which, so 

 far as known, occur on these terrace lands: 



Dichromorpha viridis Arphia sulphurea 



Orphulella speciosa " xanthopiera 



pelidna Chortophaga viridifasciata

 " minor " brevipenne

This list is doubtless incomplete. Further examination of the 

 country would probably show the presence of other typical or common 

 Piedmont forms not here listed. 



The river marshes are characterized by a fauna which in many 

 respects appro.ximates that typical of the wet lands of the Coastal 

 Plain, but which retains a strong Piedmont cast. In southeastern 

 Pennsylvania these marshes have yielded a rich Orthopteran fauna 

 consisting of the following species: 



Dichromorpha viridis Paroxya Jioridiana

" femoratus 



In this list two minor groups are represented, i.e., that charac- 

 teristic of dry ground, such as occurs on the low elevations which 

 occur here and there on the marshes, and that of the marshes proper. 

 The former includes such sjiecies as Orphulella speciosa, 0. pelidna, 

 Arphia xanthoptera, Chortophaga viridifasciata, Encoptolophus sordidus, 

 Dissosteira Carolina, Melanoplus atlatiis, M. minor, Conocephalus 

 robustus, and Xiphidium stridum. The second group includes 

 Stenobothrus curtipennis, Mecostethus Uiieatus, Paroxya floridiana, 

 Conocephalus nebrascensis, C. palustris and Orchelimum spinulosum. 

 The remaining si^ecies occur indifferently in both kinds of liabitat, 

 though certain of them may exhibit a stronger preference for one 

 of the habitats as compared >vith the other. 



" Apparently very un\i.s\ial, but represented by specimens in the collection 

 of the Academy of Natural ticiences. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 473 



The Coastal Plain affinities of these lowlands is shown in the 

 presence of such Orthoptera as Paroxya Jloridiana, Conocephalus 

 robustus, C. nebrascensis and C. palustris, and in the comparative 

 abundance of such forms as Orphulella pelidna and Scudderia lexensis. 

 On the other hand, the influence of the Piedmont is evidenced by the 

 abundance of species like Dichromorpha viridis, Orphulella speciosa, 

 Stenobothrus curtipennis and Encoplolophus sordidus. 



In this narrow strip of Coastal Plain country the most abundant 

 grasshopper is Melanoplus femxtr-rubrum. It far outnumbers all 

 the other species and is especially abundant in the low humid tracts 

 adjoining the river marshes. Less common, but quite frequent 

 species are Dichromorpha viridis, Stenobothrus curtipennis, Dissosteira 

 Carolina, Chortophaga viridifasciata, Encoptolophus sordidus, Orphu- 

 lella speciosa, Orchelimum vulgare, Melanoplus differentialis, M. 

 femoratus, Xiphidium fasciatum, Orchelimum spimdosum, Xiphidium 

 strictum, X. brevipenne and Arphia xanthoptera. Other forms of 

 not uncommon occurrence are Orphulella pelidna, which in spots 

 may be a close rival of its congener, 0. speciosa, Conocephalus robustus, 

 C. triops, and Scudderia lexensis. The remaining species are more 

 or less infrequent or local in distribution. 



Further south at Newcastle, Delaware, the Coastal Plain com- 

 ponent of the fauna becomes more prominent, due to the influx of 

 the more strictly Coastal types, such as Tryxalis brevicornis, Syrbula 

 admirabilis and Orchelimum herbaceum. My study at this locality 

 was very superficial, but during a few hours' collecting there I noted 

 the following species: 



Tryxalis brevicornis Melanoplus differentialis 

 Syrbula admirabilis " femoratus 



Dichromorpha viridis Paroxya jloridiana 



Orphulella speciosa Scudderia tcxensis

East of the Delaware River in New Jersey the Middle District 

 forms a zone varying l^etween 10 and 25 miles in width. The under- 

 lying geological formations are unconsolidated sediments of sand, 

 clay and glauconitic marls with occasional shell beds belonging to 

 the Cretaceous and Miocene Ages, but, except where they have been 

 exposed by stream erosion, these are everywhere covered by a sheet 

 of Pleistocene sand and gravel. Close to the Delaware-Atlantic 




474 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



divide the land possesses a moderate amount of relief; here the 

 streams have cut ravines of from 50 to 100 feet in depth. Near the 

 Delaware, however, the surface is an almost level plain with the 

 streams meandering sluggishly through wide tidal mud-flats. In 

 their upper courses there is sufficient fall to enable the streams to 

 effect fairlj^ adequate drainage, so that extensive inland bogs com- 

 parable to those at the heads of the Pine Barren streams, are excep- 

 tional. In their lower reaches the streams are so near tide level 

 that drainage is extremely imperfect and, as a result, the low flats 

 bordering the streams are kept in a state of perpetual saturation. 



The soils of the Middle District are much more varied than are 

 those of the other subdivisions of the Coastal Plain. The most 

 frequent is the Norfolk sand which occurs at practically all levels. 

 As a rule, it is thinner than in the Pine Barrens and the resultant 

 proximity to the water-table probably accounts for the somewhat 

 less xerophytic aspect of the vegetation which in West Jersey grows 

 on this type of soil. At higher elevations, where Norfolk sand is 

 naturally drier, it is not readilj' cultivable and is accordingly mostly 

 forested, the dominant tree growth consisting of pines {Pinus 

 virginiana and rigida), oaks {Qnercus alba, stellata, prinus, marylandica 

 and ilicifoUa) and hickories (Hichoria alba and glabra). At lower 

 levels, as in the immediate vicinity of the Delaware River, where the 

 surface of the sand approaches close to tide level, conditions obtain 

 similar to those of the Coastal Strip. The sand here is quite product- 

 ive, and consequently most of-the countrj- is cleared and used for 

 farming purposes. 



Locally there are extensive tracts of loamy soils developed in 

 West Jersey which in many respects closely aiiproach the Piedmont 

 soils. The more im]iortant of these are the Collington sandy loam 

 and the Sassafras loam. The former is derived from the green sand 

 or glauconitic marls of the Cretaceous series. This material is 

 highly retentive of moisture and is ali'o extreincly rich in available 

 plant-foods. The Collington sandy loam is largely confined to the 

 vicinity of the streams along which the greensand layers have been 

 exposed by erosion. Owing to its richness, nearly all areas of this 

 soil are under cultivation; the forests persisting only on the steeper 

 slopes along the streams. Tlic vegetation is decidedly mesophytic 

 in aspect, the usual tree growth consisting of white, black and red 

 oaks, hickories, chestnut, beech, tulip-trees, red cedar, sweet gum, 

 red maple and dogwood. 



The Sassafras loam is typically represented in the vicinity of

men in the upper portions of the district, though, on the whole, 

 considerably less frequent than in the Piedmont Region. Orphulella 

 speciosa has been taken in the Middle District, but appears to be 

 exceedingly scarce, in marked contrast to its abundance on the west 

 shores of the Delaware. During four seasons' collecting I took only 

 two specimens. The Piedmont component of the fauna gradually 

 thins out as one goes southward. Encoptolophus sordidus I have not 

 taken south of Laurel Springs, Camden Comity, while the southern 

 limits of Dichromorpha viridis are, according to my observations, in 

 the vicinity of Bridgeton, Cumberland County. Stenobothrus 

 curtipennis extends into the Cape ^lay Peninsula, but is there of 

 very local occurrence. 



The most abundant grasshopper is Melanoplus femur-rubrum. 

 Other forms which appear to be of common occurrence are Orphu- 

 lella pelidna, Melanoplus atlanis, Dissosteira Carolina, Chortophaga 

 viridifasciata, Arphia xanthoplera, Orchelimum vulgare, Melanoplus 

 femoratus, Psijiidia fenestralis, Xiphidium fascialum. Xiphidium 

 strictmn, Paroxya floridiana, Melanoplus differentialis (locally on the 

 Delaware below Gloucester), Encoptolophus sordidus (in the northern 

 half only), Xiphidium breripenne, and Arpkia sulphurea. Somewhat 

 less frequent, but of not uncommon occurrence, are Syrbula adniira- 

 bilis, Melanoplus scudderi, Scudderia texensis, curvicauda and furcata, 

 Conocephalus robustus, C. triops, Spharagemon bolli, Hippiscus 

 rugosus, Dichromorpha viridis (northern section only) and Steno- 

 bothrus curtipennis (frequent, 'but somewhat local, in northern 

 section, exceptional in southern section). The remaining species 

 are either rare or, if frequent, only under exceptional circumstances. 



Locally, where there are considerable areas of nearly pure sand of 

 moderately high elevation, conditions prevail closely resembling those 

 of the Pine Rarrens. An isolated patch of this kind occurs just west 

 of Jericho, Cumberland County (shown in ]iink on the map accom- 

 panying the State report on insects). In sucli jjlaces the Orthoptera 

 have a strong Pine Barren aspect. The prevailing species are 

 Scirtetica marmorata, Melarioplus luridus, Psinidia fenestralis, Sphar- 

 agemon bolli, Spharagemon wyomingiana, Orphulella pelidna, Arphia 

 sulphurea, Hippisctis phienicopterus and Schistoc^rca rubiginosa. 

 With these are other species, such as Dissosteira Carolina, Melanoplus 

 atlanis, Arphia xanthoplera, Chortophaga viridifasciata, Schistocerca 

 damnifica, Melanoplus scudderi, M. femoratus, M. femur-rubrum (a 

 minor constituent of this association), Syrbida admirabilis, Scudderia 

 curvicauda and furcata and Xiphidium brevipenne. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 477 



On those areas where the dominant soil is a loam, as in the "marl- 

 belt" and the Sassafras loam district, the Orthoptera have a pro- 

 nounced mesophilous aspect, the fauna closely resembling that of 

 the Piedmont Region. This faunule is dominated by Melnnopliis 

 femnr-rubrum, with which are usually associated Dissesteira Carolina, 

 Melanoplus femoratus, Arphia xanthoptera, Orphulella pelidna, 

 Dichromorpha riridis, Choriophaga viridifasdata, Encoptolophus sordi- 

 dus and Orchelinmm indgarc. 



IV (rf). The Cape May District. 



This, according to Stone, includes the Cape May Peninsula south 

 of the Great Cedar Swamp. Floristically, the district is charac- 

 terized by the presence of a considerable number of Lower Austral 

 types which do not extend north of the district. In the Orthopteran 

 fauna this distinction is not so pronounced, the only species which 

 are peculiar to the region or extend but a short distance beyond it 

 being Merniiria vigilans and Conocephalus Juscostriatus. Negatively, 

 the district is characterized by the absence or relative scarcity of 

 certain Middle District and Pine Barren species. Of Middle District 

 species the following are as yet unknown from the Cape May Penin- 

 sula: Dichromorpha viridis, Encoptolophus sordidus, Melanoplus 

 differentialis and Atlanticus dorsalis; Orphidella speciosa and Steno- 

 bothrus curtipennis occur, but are local and usually quite rare. 



Of typical Pine Barren species there appear to be no records of the 

 existence of the following species in the Cape May Peninsula, though 

 some of them may occur as far south as the southern edge of the 

 Great Cedar Swamp, as at Sea Isle Junction, where I have taken 

 several species which I have not been able to find elsewhere in the 

 Peninsula:

In the Cape May Peninsula two subdivisions, each with certain 

 distinctive physiographic and hiotic features, can usually be dis- 

 tinguished. One of these, which in every respect agrees with the 

 Coastal District as already described, includes the salt marshes, the 

 low forelands just inside of the salt marshes and the beaches. The 

 other subdivision we maj^ speak of as the Interior District. This 

 in its general aspect closely resembles the true Pine Barrens, though 

 differing from the latter in some imi)ortant respects. It consists 

 of a flat sandy plain, which, except where cleared by human agency, 

 is covered with a practically continuous stretch of oak and pine 

 forest. 



The characteristics of the Coa.stal District, so far as they come 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 479 



within the scope of this article, have alreadj^ been considered. In 

 the Cape May region the Coastal District is represented by a narrow 

 strip along the ocean, locally known as "The Seaside," and a similar 

 strip along the shore of Delaware Bay, known as "The Bayside." 

 Both are alike in essential respects, although the beaches are absent 

 or exceptional on the bayside. North of Wildwood Junction the 

 seaside and bayside are entirely separated by the wooded interior, 

 but south of that point, as noted by Stone, the two converge and 

 unite to form a continuous belt of Coastal District country extending 

 clear across the lower third of the peninsula. 



The Interior District, as previously mentioned, partakes of the 

 nature of the Pine Barrens. The soil is typically a coarse sand of 

 the Norfolk type. It is similar apparently to the sands of the Pine 

 Barrens, but differs in its usually more humid condition and its 

 higher content of organic matter, a state of affairs doubtless due to 

 the extremely low elevation (rarely over 25 feet above ,sea-level) and 

 consequent proximity of the surface to underground water. The tree 

 growth consists predominantly of pitch pine {Pinus rigida), white 

 oak (Quercus alba), post oak (Q. stellata) and pig-nut hickory (Hichoria 

 glabra); of less frequent occurrence are Jersey pine {P. virginiana), 

 black oak (Q. velutina), Spanish oak {Q. triloba), black-jack (Q. mary- 

 landica), sassafras (Sassafras sassafras) and holly (Ilex opaca). 



The bogs of the Interior in their general appearance closely resemble 

 those of the Pine Barrens, but, with a few exceptions in the northern- 

 most part of the district, differ from the latter in the conspicuous 

 absence of the white cedar (C ha ma'cy parts thyoides). The usual 

 tree growth consists of red maple (Acer rubrum), sour-gum (Nyssa 

 sylvatica), magnolia (M. virginiana), sweet-gmn (Liquidamber 

 styraciflua), Spanish oak (Q. triloba) and willow oak (Q. phellos). 

 The lower scrub growth consists largely of Clethra alnifolia and Azalea 

 viscosa. In clearings the dominant plants are Woodwardia rirginica, 

 Juncus (tall species, probably canadensis) and sedges (Eriophorum 

 virginicum and Rhynchospora alba); with these are associated lesser 

 numbers of such plants, as Lilium superbum, Aletris farinosa, Ble- 

 phariglottis blephariglottis, Pogonia ophioglossoides, Drosera longifolia, 

 Polygala lutea, P. crucinta, Rhexia virginiana, R. mariana, Asclepias 

 pulchra and Oxypolis rigidior. 



South of Wildwood Junction the character of the vegetation under- 

 goes a gradual change, assuming more the aspect of the vegetation 

 which is characteristic of the lowland woods of the Delaware Valley 

 and Coastal District. The pitch pine becomes a less important 




480 _ PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



constituent of the flora, though not uncommon in spots throughout 

 the whole lower part of the peninsula. 



Orthoptera, such as we are concerned with in this article, occur 

 in numbers only in those parts of the Interior District where more or 

 less extensive clearings exist in the otherwise continuous forests. 

 Where the clearings are small and entirely surrounded or bordered 

 by the woods, a sylvan type of fauna obtains similar in facies to that 

 of the Pine Barrens, but lacking some of the more distinctive species 

 of the latter, such as Spharagemon iryomingianum, Melanoplus 

 fasciatus smd impudicus and Orchelimum erylhrocephalum. This 

 faunule is best developed in the northern section of the district : 

 in the southern section it appears to be only locally represented. 



The species usually associated with the dry jjine and oak woods 

 are the following: 



OrphuleUa pelidna Schistocerca i-ubujinosa 



Arphin sulphurea Melanoplus scudderi 

 HippiscHS phocnicopterus " luridus 



Spharagemon bolli Scudderia curvicauda 

 Psinidia fenestralis " furcata 



Scirtetica marmoraki Amblycoryphn oblongifolia 



Schistocerca damnifica Microcenlrum sp. 



The bogs are characterized by the presence of the following: 



Schistocerca alutacea Scudderia furcata 



Scudderia curvicauda 



In the extreme southern pOrtion of the peninsula some of the 

 species here listed are ai)pari'ntly only locally repr(>sented. This 

 is especially the case with the more characteristic Pine Bnrren forms, 

 such as Scirtetica marmorata, Melanoplus luridus and Schistocerca 

 alutacea and rubiginosa, all of which are abundant in the northern 

 section, but are of only exceptional occvirrence in the southern 

 section. Their scarcity is evidently correlated with the absence of 

 typical Pine Barren conditions. 



In the Interior District removal of the forest on any extensive 

 scale and the utilization of the land for agricultural purposes is 

 followed l)y changes in the character of the fauna and flora similar 

 to those taking place under like conditions in the Pine Barrens. 

 The more exclusively sylvan species disappear and their place is taken 

 by campestral types like those of the neighboring Coastal Di-^trict. 

 I have given especial attention to this matter in the viciniij' of South 

 Seaville, where the country adjoining the road connecting the seaside 

 with the bayside^has been largely cleared and placed uiuler cultiva-

tion. In this region neglected fields are occupied by a weed vegeta- 

 tion similar to that occurring in similar situations in the Coastal 

 Strip, and this is correlated with the presence of similar species of 

 Orthoptera, the more important species being the following: 



Syrbula admirabilis Melanoplus femur-rubrum 



OrphideUa pelidna " feinoratus 



Arphia xanthoptera Scudderia curvicauda 



Chortophaga viridifasciata " furcata

Summary. 



1. In the region covered by eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey 

 two strikingly different types of Orthopteran faunas are exemplified, 

 namely, a Transition fauna in eastern Pennsylvania and northern 

 New Jersey and an Upper Austral fauna in southern New JerseJ^ 



2. In this region the Transition fauna coincides in distribution 

 with the Appalachian Mountain System and the Piedmont Plateau; 

 the Upper Austral fauna with the Coastal Plain. 



3. It is not possible with the data at present available to give a 

 complete causal explanation of the observed facts of distribution as 

 exemplified by the Orthoptera of this region. 



4. Atmospheric temperature alone does not afford a satisfactory 

 explanation of the facts of distribution; more pertinent is the tem- 

 perature of the medium in which or on which the organism, or any 

 stage of the organism, dwells. The areal distribution of an organism 

 is probably a resultant of the interaction of a number of factors and 

 not of any one single factor. 



5. In the region includetl in this study the striking differences 

 between the biotas of the Piedmont Plateau and the Coastal Plain 

 are closely correlated with equally striking differences in topography, 

 drainage and soils. 



6. The Piedmont Plateau is a region of considerable elevation and 

 good drainage. Permanently wet areas constitute a relatively insig- 

 nificant feature of the region. 



7. The Coastal Plain is a region of very slight elevation and usually 

 poor drainage. Permanently wet areas constitute highly important 

 physiographic features of the region. 



8. The soils of the Piedmont Plateau are loams of residual origin. 




482 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



They are usually rich in moisture and available plant-food ele- 

 ments. 



9. The soils of the Coastal Plain are prevailingly relatively coarse 

 sands of detrital origin. They are frequently deficient in moisture 

 and available plant-food elements. 



10. From an Orthopteran faunistic standpoint, four primary 

 subdivisions are recognizable in the eastern Pennsylvania-New Jersey 

 region, namely, Appalachian, Piedmont, Coastal and Pine Barren. The 

 first two are subdivisions of the Transition Zone, the last two of the 

 Coastal Plain. Each may be regarded as a local centre of dispersal. 



11. From the same standpoint, the Highlands, the Middle District 

 and the Cape May Peninsula are to be considered as of secondary 

 value, each representing a sort of tension zone in which there is an 

 intermingling, overlapping or interdigitation of species from adjoining 

 primary districts. 



12. The Orthopteran fauna of the Appalachian District has never 

 been adequately studied from a faunistic standpoint. The available 

 data indicate that it is fundamentally Piedmont in type with the 

 addition of a number of distinctively northern (boreal) species. 



13. The Orthopteran fauna of the Highlands has also never been 

 adequately studied. The available evidence indicates that it is 

 thoroughly Piedmont in type with a few stragglers from the Appala- 

 chian District. 



14. The Orthopteran fauna of the Piedmont Plateau is predomi- 

 nantly mesophilous. This is correlated with the presence of a 

 dominant mcsophytic type of vegetation. 



15. The Orthopteran ecological associations of the Piedmont 

 Plateau are usually not clearlj^ delimited. In a general way three 

 such groujjs correlated with the relative moisture content of the 

 habitat may be recognized. These are the mesophilous, xerophilous 

 and hygrophilous associations. Each of these may exhibit an open- 

 country or campestral phase and a woodland or sylvan phase. 



16. The mesophilous association is characteristic of rich loamy 

 soils and a luxuriant vegetation, of which the dominant members are 

 bright green, succulent, sod-forming grasses. 



17. The xeroi)hilous association of the Piedmont Plateau consists 

 exclusively of the humicolous subdivision; arenicolous and saxi- 

 colous species are lacking owing to the absence of pure sand and the 

 scarcity of bare rock surfaces. This a.ssociation typically occurs on 

 u]ilands or hillsides where the soil is unsuited for agricultural jjurposes. 

 The associated vegetation is of a mildly xerophytic tj^pe. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 483 



18. The hygrophilous association of the Piedmont Plateau is of 

 relatively subordinate importance owing to the limited extent of 

 permanently moist lands. It is not sharply separable from the 

 dominant mesophilous association. It occurs in stream meadows 

 and small wet areas about springs or in seepage depressions. The 

 associated vegetation consists of hydrophytes and mesophytes with 

 hydrophytic tendencies. 



19. In each of these associations the dominant phase in the Pied- 

 mont Plateau region is the campestral. The sjdvan constitutes a 

 relatively insignificant part of the fauna. The removal of the forests 

 and the utilization of the land for farming purposes evidently favor 

 the campestral types, while they restrict the more exclusively sylvan 

 types. 



20. The Orthopteran fauna of the Coastal Plain consists of two 

 widely diverse, but important, constituent associations. One of 

 these is a xerophilous association characteristic of the upland, the 

 other a hygrophilous association characteristic of wet or humid areas. 

 Besides these there is a mesophilous association which, however, i.s 

 of relatively minor importance. 



21. In contrast with their indefinite character in the Piedmont, 

 the Orthopteran ecological groups of the Coastal Plain are usuallj' 

 quite clearly defined. 



22. The xerophilous association of the Coastal Plain includes both 

 arenicolous and humicolous species. It is typically developed on 

 dry, sandy soils and is associated with a more or less xeroph}i:ic tj'pe 

 of vegetation. 



23. The hj'grophilous association of the Coastal Plain is highly 

 developed. It shows three different types in accordance with the 

 nature of the respective enviromnents. These are: (1) the fresh- 

 water-marsh type, (2) the maritime or salt-marsh type, and (3) the 

 peat-bog tj'pe. They are associated with hydrophytic (fresh-marsh 

 type) or zerophytic (salt-marsh and peat-bog tj'pes) types of vegetation . 



24. The mesophilous association of the Coastal Plain is typical 

 of rich, loamy soils and is best represented in the productive farming 

 districts of the Middle District. This association tends to invade 

 other districts when these are placed under cultivation. 



25. Primar\' faunistic subdivisions, or centres of dispersal, of the 

 Coastal Plain are the Coastal and Pine Barren districts; .secondary 

 subdivisions, or zones of tension, are the Middle District and Cape 

 May Peninsula. The latter is a minor centre of dispersal for a 

 limited number of southern Orthoptera. 



33 




484 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



26 The Coastal faunule is composed of four associations, namely, 

 (a) Subcoastal, (b) Littoral, (c) Submaritime and (d) Maritnne 



27 The Subcoastal association is characteristic of the upland 

 portions of the Coastal Strip and is associated with a sandy soil, 

 moderate humidity, open campestral country and a mildly xerophytic 

 type of vegetation. The dominant Orthoptera are humicolous 

 xerophiles of the campestral phase, though arenicoles may be locally 

 common. This at the present time appears to be the dommant 

 Orthopteran association of the Coastal Plain. It tends to spread 

 inland with the removal of the forests and there displace the Pine 



Barren types. • . . , u u 



■■>8 Tlie Littoral association is characteristic of the sea-beaches. 

 It 'is associated with wind-drifted sands and a highly xerophj-t.c 

 type of vegetation. A fairly definite zonation in the distribution 

 of the Orthoptera can be recognized, the outer or frontal dunes being 

 characterized by arenicoles, the leeward dunes by humicoles. Open 

 grass formations prevail on the frontal dunes, dense thickets on the 



leeward dunes. . 



29 Human occupation of the beaches is evidently effecting tar- 

 reaching changes in the composition of the beach fauna and flora 

 A number of Subcoastal Orthoptera appear to have been mtroduced 

 directly or indirectly through human agency. 



30 The Submaritime association is a somewhat modihetl repre- 

 sentative of the fresli-water marsh group and is characteristic of the 

 low lands adjoining the salt marshes. -It is associated with a muck 

 soil, abundant moisture and a mixed type of vegetation varying 

 from hydrophytes to xerophytes according to location, but con- 

 sisting mostly of the former. 



31 The Maritime association is characteristic of the salt marshes. 

 It is'associated with a soil saturated with water and ..rganic debris 

 and with a highly halophHic type of vegetation. 



io The Pine Barren faunule is fundamentally a sylvan group, 

 divisible into a Sand Barren ^Pine Barren in the narrower sense) 

 association and a Peat Bog (Cedar Swamp) association. In cultivated 

 areas the sylvicoles are replaced by a campestral association cor- 

 respon.ling in essential features to the Subcoastal association of the 



Coa.stal District. . , ... 



33 The Sand Barren association is a distinctively xerophilou. 

 group and inc^lu-les both arenicoles and humicoles. the former pre- 

 vailing on exposed patches of sand, the latter in the vegetation. 

 It is Lsociated with a sandy soil, low humidity, forested country 

 and a strongly xerophytic type of vegetation. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 485 



34. The Peat Bog association is a hygrophilous group associated 

 with a peaty substratum, abundant moisture, forested surroundings 

 and a prevailingly xerophytic type of vegetation. 



35. The claim of the Middle District to recognition as a distinct 

 Orthopteran faunistic subdivision of the Coastal Plain rests solely 

 upon the intermingling and overlapping of faunules from the adjoin- 

 ing centres of dispersal. Certain characteristic Piedmont species 

 are entirely or almost entirely limited to this part of the Coastal Plain. 



36. The Middle District includes a narrow strip of relatively low 

 land adjoining the Delaware River in southeastern Pennsj'lvania. 

 Faunistically, this shows considerable differences from the typical 

 Middle District as represented in west Jersey. 



37. The Orthopteran faunule of the Pennsylvania subdivision of 

 the Middle District is essentially a Piedmont fauna with which is 

 intermixed a minor constituent of Coastal .Plain origin. The latter 

 is best represented in the river marshes. 



38. In the Middle District of west Jersey the dominant faunule 

 is the Coastal faunule, the Piedmont faunule being a decidedly minor 

 constituent of the Orthopteran fauna. The Pine Barren faunule 

 is only locally represented. 



39. The Piedmont types are frequent in the northern half of the 

 Middle District, but chsappear rapidly in the southern section. 

 They are typically associated with the presence of loam soils, a 

 moderate supply of moisture and mesophytic vegetation. 



40. The Cape May District includes representatives of two 

 faunules. One, corresponding to the Coastal faunule, characterizes 

 the two sides of the Peninsula and its entire lower third; the other, 

 representing a southward extension of part of the Pine Barren 

 faunule, occupies the interior districts of the northern section. 



42. The Interior Orthopteran association of the Cape May Dis- 

 trict is a typical sylvan group. Clearing of the countrj' and its 

 conversion into farm lands is accompanied by a disappearance of 

 the sylvan tj'pes and an invasion of the campestral Subcoastal 

 association.

 range, the normal being vastly in excess of the latter type, which 

 may be regarded as relatively scarce. In addition there is much 

 variability as regards color and markings in different individuals, 

 these occurring indifferently in both the normal and bilineata types. 

 Of the color varieties there are, (a) a form with the ground color a 

 light olivaceous; (b) one in which it is green; (c) a form which may 

 have either of these two ground colors, but has more or less of the 

 upper surface a bright crimson or orange, instead of the usual pale 

 brown. Of the variations in markings there are two forms, one in 

 which the body color is practically uniform, another in which it is 

 conspicuously mottled with darker blotches of black or browii. 

 In our region the most frequent type is the uniformly colored, 

 olivaceous variety, but the others are by no means infrequent.

0. pelidna Burm. 



General Range. — Southern New England, Ontario, Michigan 

 and Minnesota, south to Florida and the Gulf States, west to Colorado 

 and New Mexico; most abundant in the Austral zones, especially 

 near the coast, more or less local in the northern and central States. 



Local Distribution. — Rare or only occasionally' frequent locallj' 

 in the Piedmont Plateau; common locally in the Pennsylvania 

 portion of the Aliddle District; abundant in all parts of the Coastal 

 Plain, including the beaches. 



Ecological Distribution. — Habitat preferences rather variable, 

 but typically a humicolous xerophile. In the Piedmont Region it 

 is associated with 0. speciosa; in the Coastal Plain it usually occurs 

 on dry sands or sandy loams wherever there is at least a moderate 

 amount of plant cover in the form of grass or low herbage; less 

 frequently it occurs in open peat-bogs and meadows.

Remarks. — Only the yellow-winged phase of this species seems to 

 occur in any numbers in our region. The red or orange-winged 

 phase I have never seen in the field, though it is possible that it may 

 occur as a very rare variant. This is in marked contrast to the 

 frequency of the red-winged phase in the Ccnlral Western States 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 497 



where it is nearly or quite as common as the yellow phase. The 

 usual explanation that the red-winged phase is due to greater humidity 

 is difficult to harmonize with the almost exclusive prevalence of the 

 yellow-winged type in our region, which is more humid than the 

 States west of the Appalachians.

 the Pine Barrens, occurring chiefly near human hal^itations. 



Ecological Distribution. — Occurs in a wide range of habitats; 

 most typical apparently of relatively dry, open grasslands, but not 

 infrequent in more humid surroundings, such as meadowlands; 

 avoids locations that are actually wet. Less frequent in sylvan 

 habitats than in campestral. Exceptional on bare sand and in low

 local ea.st of the Alleghanics inihe vicinity of Philadelphia.-- 



LocAL Distribution. — Abundant, at least locally, in the low 

 marshy lands adjoining the lower Delaware River and its tributaries. 



Ecological Distribution. — Characteristic of alluvial lowlands, 

 frequenting the den.se .succulent grasses of the marshes — e.g., liomalo- 

 cenchrus oryzoides — and the rank vegetation about their borders, 

 especially the tall ragweed {Ambrosia Irifida); spreading from such 

 locations to the adjoining upland fields and gardens.

'" In a personal letter Mr. Davis informs me that '"southward the insect gets 

 larger and the female was in consequence described as C. bmneri by Mr. Blatch- 

 ley." If the latter is a synonym of this species it would extend its known range 

 as far west as Indiana at least. C. bruneri has also been recorded from North 

 Carolina (Sherman and Brimley). 




524 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [June, 



Ecological Distribution. — Along the coast occurs both in true 

 salt marsh and in the marginal (Submaritime) zones, though in my 

 experience it is most frequent in true salt marsh, where it chiefly 

 inhabits the tall, reedy growths of Spartina glabra along the tidal 

 streams and ditches. Mr. Davis writes that he found it at Lake- 

 hurst about cranberry bogs.

'^ After examining some specimens of this species kindly sent me by Mr. Davis, 

 I am almost certain that I have taken the same species at Ocean Mew in Cape 

 May County, .it the time I received Mr. Davis' specimens I had already 

 donated my own collections to the Philadelphia Academy and removed to Indiana, 

 and was therefore unable to directly verify my suspicions by comparing my 

 material with determined specimens sent by Mr. Davis. Some of the specimens 

 in my collection which 1 have labelled lyrisies will, I think, prove to be caudellianus.

blance. In Yoldia, Teredo and Ischnochiton, for example, the velum 

 is ultimately discarded, and a study of the diagrams (fig. 1) will 

 serve to show that the differences between the development of the 

 solenogastres and the cliitons are in large measure due to the size 

 of the test or velum. Whether or not this is a fundamental fact 

 depends upon the liistory of the early blastomeres. which is lacking 

 at the present time ; nevertheless, there are many indications that 

 the two classes of animals have descended from a common ancestor. 



Fig. 1. — Diagrams illustrating the development of tlie primary gorin layers in 

 the chitons (A, B) and solenogastres (C, D). b, cells producing the cerebral 

 ganglia; g, archcntcron; si, stomoda"um; (, test cells. Such devices as stip- 

 pling, cross-hatching and parallel diagonal lines indicate homologous regions. 



The egg of Halomenia gravida is a spherical body, densely and 

 uniformly packed with yolk, and is surrounded before it leaves the 

 ovotestis with a distinct vitelline membrane. In the earliest stage 

 represented at least one polar body is distinctly visible, and imme- 

 diately beneath it the female j^ronudeus is clearly defined. Close 

 to the equator of the egg another nucleus, probably the male pro- 

 nucleus, appears with equal distinctness. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 537 



In the next stags segmentation has commenced, resulting in 28 

 cells of approximately eciual size. There is no sign of a blastocele 

 or any signs of differentiation. In the succeeding stage fully 100 cells 

 are present and size differences are apparent, but while a slight 

 elongation defines the antero-posterior axis of the larva, the absence 

 of blastocele and stomodseuni renders it difficult to accurately define 

 the ventral and dorsal surfaces. 



In the following stage the differentiation of the test has com- 

 menced and, judging from two larvae where the polar bodies remain 

 attached, it extends over the greater portion of the dorsal surface and 

 to a considerable extent of the ventral as well (fig. 1, C). The 

 remaining cells, those destined to form the future animal, are thus 

 in large measure enclosed. The cells not included in the test but 

 bordering upon the surface are, generally speaking, of smaller size 

 than those upon the interior (in one specimen this is more marked 

 than in the one figured), but there is up to this time no clear tlifferen- 

 tiation into ectoderm and endoderm. In the mid-ventral line, in 

 immediate contact with the border of the test, are slender elements 

 {st) that represent the first stages in the formation of the stomofUieum. 

 The comparatively thin cells (C, b) in the neighborhood of the polar 

 body (not represented) are a constant feature and evidently furnish 

 the material for the development of the cerebral ganglia. 



In later stages (as in D) the various regions of the body are dis- 

 tincth^ outlined, and to some extent the digestive and nervous 

 systems have been sketched in. The stomodseum is clearly differen- 

 tiated and the mid-gut is outlined, though its constituent cells and 

 cavity are not as yet in an advanced state of development. The 

 cerebral ganglia comprise large masses of cells forming a group 

 anterior to the stomodseum. Posteriorly, these divide, encircle the 

 stomodseum and extend along the ventral surface to the posterior 

 end of the body. At various points in the trunk region between the 

 gut and body wall or test there are a few scattered cells, yolk-laden 

 and accordingly distinguishable from the ganglionic products. They 

 probably are mesoblastic elements. 



At the posterior end of the body is a ring of cells, ciliated in Myzo- 

 menia, that enclose a depressed area bordered in the earliest recog- 

 nizable stage by relatively slender cells. These last-named elements 

 appear to divide repeatedly and become transformed into a group of 

 cells bordering upon the surface and on the other hand passing 

 without a sharp line of demarcation into the ganglionic cords. In 

 the oldest stage represented the nerve cord appears to be completely 




538 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Jul.Y, 



cut off from, though in contact with, a fairly distinct group of cells 

 bordering the surface of the body. It thus appears that the cells 

 enclosed by the ring of larger cells become transformed into a sense 

 organ, perhaps the dorso-terminal sense organ known to occur in 

 many solenogastres. 



In the latest stages the test becomes considerably reduced in size 

 and the trunk gains proportionately in prominence. This increase 

 in the extent of the trunk appears to be wholly due to the division 

 of definite ectoderm trunk cells and not to any products supplied 

 by the test. Measurements show conclusively that the test cells 

 gradually shrink in bulk, probably due to the absorption of their 

 nutritive products, and karyokinetic spindles indicate activity on 

 the part of the trunlv ectoderm. To what extent this proceeds it is 

 impossible to state. In early stages there is one, possibly two cells 

 situated immediately beneath the cells (fig. 1, C, b) that I believe 

 furnish the material for the cerebral ganglia. In later stages there 

 are indications that this tlceper seated cell has undergone a few divis- 

 ions, and the resulting protlucts occupy the space (fig. 1, D) between 

 the alimentary canal, cerebral ganglia and test cells of the head 

 region. They may possibly represent mesoblastic products, but 

 their relatively large size (for the sake of clearness, they are smaller 

 in the diagram than in reality) and their jwsition suggests that they 

 may supply the material for the head epidermis as the test recedes. 



Turning now to the development of the species described by 

 Pruvot, we find that especially in Proneomenia aglaopheniw the early 

 development follows essentially the same ])ath as in Halomenia. 

 In the other species, Mijzomenia banijulensis, there is a decided 

 difference in the size of the cells during the early cleavages, Init in 

 ])oth cases the close of segmentation finds the larvie const ructeil 

 upon the same plan. The test is evidently of greater size than in 

 Halomenia and more completely envelops the remaining cells so 

 that they are hidden in lat(>ral view, but the arrangement of the 

 cells is evidently quite similar to that shown in tliagram C." The 

 enclosed elements are supposed to be endodermal in character, and 

 the region (depressed in the species studied l)y Pruvot) liordered 

 by the test is termed the blastopore. I believe both of these state- 

 ments are incorrect as I shall now attempt to demonstrate. 



Generally speaking, the velum of the trochozoa forms only an 

 insignificant portion of the ectoderm. In the .solcnoga-stres it ha.s 

 expanded to such an extent that it comes in contact with the cells 

 destined to form the cerebral ganglia, ami posteriorly it forms a 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHIL.VDELPHIA. 539 



considerable portion of tlie trunk as well. But the important fact 

 remains that in Halomenia the position of the stomodseum, which 

 marks the position of the blastopore, is uiunistakable and, as the 

 diagrams show, it is located immediately behind the border of the 

 test on the ventral surface. Furthermore, the diagrams illustrate 

 the fact that there remain many other exposed cells bounded by the 

 test, and these become directly transformed into the trunk ectoderm. 

 In other words, diagram C is a gastrula stage just as certainly as 

 diagram A, the main tlifferences in the solenogastres being correlated 

 with an epibolic type of gastrulation and the enormous size of the 

 velum. The accurate details of the process are lacking and close 

 comparisons are not possible at present, but the important fact is 

 certainly clear that the cells enclosed by the test are not all endoderm 

 and the blastopore is small and typically situated. 



In later stages certain developmental processes are described that 

 rest in part upon the assumption that all of the region bounded by 

 the test represents the blastopore. In this depressed area the cells 

 are stated to form, by a species of delamination, the future definitive 

 ectoderm and endoderm. The outer layer, circumscribed by the 

 test, now represents the trunk ectoderm, and in it three invaginations 

 soon appear. One of these remains open and becomes the procto- 

 daeum, while the other two soon close and are transformed into 

 mesoblastic bands. Still later the borders of the proctodeum 

 (evidently the large terminal cells of the trunk that form a ring as in 

 D) are said to develop into a sort of caudal button (bouton caudal) 

 that at first projects into the blastocele. Finally the button becomes 

 evaginated and with the trunk ectoderm protrudes beyond the 

 l)orders of the test. 



In commenting upon these observations it is to be noted that a 

 depression exists in Halomenia within the terminal ring-like group 

 of largo cells, but it is in no way connected with the endoderm. 

 No sign of a proctodseum is evident at this time nor has it put in an 

 appearance in a stage considerably beyond the one represented in 

 diagram D. The caudal button is evidently the group of cells that 

 in Halomenia develops from the cells enclosed by the large cells of 

 the terminal ring. As already noted, these at first project into the 

 blastocele, then flatten out, and exposed to the surface are connected 

 with the ventral ganglionic cords. The mesoblast bands are evi- 

 dently these same cords, as will appear more clearly in connection 

 with the cerebral ganglia. 



In the anterior half of the embryo three invaginations now appear 




540 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [-luly, 



in the test cells on the ventral side. The median one, of a transitory 

 character, is said to represent the stomodieiim, but as a stomodieum 

 exists in Halomenia in the normal position I am strongly of the opinion 

 that Pruvot is in error regarding this point. The lateral invagina- 

 tionus unite, forming a transverse band, and posteriorly are prolonged 

 to meet the mesoblastic bands of the trunk. Some of the more 

 ilorsal elements con.stitute the cerebral ganglia. In addition, the 

 ectoderm of the head appears to arise wholly from these same lateral 

 invaginations. Such an origin of mesoblast elements is certainly 

 unique, and I have only to state that I believe this entire grouji 1- 

 ganglionic. Its posterior union with the ventral cords certainly 

 indicates its nervous character. The anterior enlargements, the 

 future cerebral ganglia, are of unusual size in Halomenia, but there 

 is nothing whatever to indicate that they comprise any mesoblastic 

 elements. Furthermore, there is nothing in Halomenia to suggest 

 the development of head ectoderm from any of these cells; and the 

 counter theory, that at least in part it may arise from one or two 

 large cells located beneath the cells responsible for the development 

 of the cerebral ganglia, has been noted in a preceding paragraph.' 



If on the basis of comparative anatomy it is impossible at tlie 

 present time to definitely place the solenogastrcs in their j^ropcT 

 systematic position, it is obvious that this is more emphatically true 

 w'here scanty embryological data are the sole criterion. However, 

 it is evident that their ilevelopnient is more in accord with what we 

 find among the moUusks than with any other phylum. The resem- 

 blance of the embryo shortly before its metamorphosis is strikingly 

 similar, in several important details, to Yoldia or Den'alium or to 

 the chitons if we neglect size differences with respect to the test. 

 Plate ('92) has shown that there are good reasons for the belief, long 

 ago expressed by Blainvilie ('25), that the scaphopods are most 

 closely related to the prosobranchs rather than to the lamellibranchs. 

 The excessively developed tests encountered in certain species of 

 the first- and last-named cla.sses are therefore not of fundamental 

 importance, and furthermore its small size in the chitons is accord- 

 ingly not a serious obstacle to the theory expressed by several authors 

 that the solenogastrcs and the chitons are derivatives of a common 

 ancestor. Such a conclusion has been based almo.st entirely on

 standpoint of emlDryology can only be decided when our knowledge

THE SCENT-PRODUCING ORGAN OF THE HONEY BEE. 

 BY X. E. McINDOO, PH.D. 



Introduction. 



Bee keepers well know that bees have an odor, Imt they do not 

 know how the odor is produced, nor do they know the role played by 

 the various odors of the honey bee. It is reported that Xassonoff 

 first described the morphology of the scent-producing organ of the 

 honey bee. His original work in Russian cannot be had here, but, 

 according to Zoubaretf (1883), Nassonoff did not describe the struc- 

 ture of this organ as seen by the writer, and he suggested that the 

 gland cells of the organ produce perspiration. 81aden (1902) called 

 this organ a "scent-producing organ," but did nothing more than to 

 <lescribe the articular membrane between the fifth and sixth abdomi- 

 nal terga of worker bees. 



This paper deals entirely with the morphology of the scent- 

 producing organ. The work dealing with the odors produced by 

 this organ and tlie significance of these odors will be reported 

 separately. 



Fresh material was stained slightly wit h a weak solution of methylin 

 green, and the cells were studied while still alive. Material was 

 also fixed in Carnoy's fluid (equal parts of absolute alcohol, chloro- 

 form, and glacial acetic acid, with corrosive sul)limate to excess). 

 The double method of emlicdding in paraffin and celloidin was 

 employed. Sections were cut 10 micra thick and they were stained 

 with Ehrlich's hamatoxylin and eosin, and with safrauin and gentian 

 violet. 



1. Structure. 



Sometimes when a worker honey bee, that is fanning, is carefuUj' 

 observed, a transverse white stripe near the end of the abdomen may 

 be seen. This white stripe (fig. 1, ArtM) is the articular membrane 

 between the fifth and sixth abdominal terga (propodeum not counted). 

 It is visible only when the last alxlominal segment is bent downward. 

 The anterior half of this membrane is folded under the posterior edge 

 of the fifth abdominal tergum, making a pouch or canal (fig. 1, Can). 

 The canal encircles about one half of the abdomen and terminates 

 on either side of the al)domen just above the articulation of the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 543 



tergum and sternum (fig. 1, ECan). The diameter of the canal is 

 greatest at the median line of the abdomen and gradually diminishes 

 to zero at each end. 



Fig. 1. — Diagram of a transveree-longitudinal view of end of abdomen of a 

 worker honey bee, showing the internal anatomy of the fiftli and sixth 

 segnient.s, and also the scent-producing organ composed of the articular 

 membrane (ArtM), the canal (Can), chitinous tubes (Tu) and gland cells 

 (GIC). The last segment is bent downward more than ever seen in the 

 living bee. That is, in the living bee only the part marked ArlM is seen 

 externally and the canal (Cait) is never seen. 




544 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



Fig. 2 is a diagram of the articular membrane, removed from the 

 abdomen and spread out fiat under a low-power lens. This membrane 

 in the living bee is shiny and appears to be covered with a trans- 

 parent liquid. The anterior margin of the membrane is bordered 

 by small barbed hairs (fig. 2, a) on the fifth tergum, and the posterior 

 margin is bordered by smaller spinelike hairs (^fig. 2, b) on the sixth 

 tergum. The chitin of the posterior portion (fig. 2, PostP) of this 

 membrance is thinner than is the chitin of the tergum, but it is 

 strengthened near its centre by a narrow and heavy vein (figs. 1 and 

 2, e), and at its anterior margin there is a heavier and much wider 

 vein (figs. 1 and 2, d). 



The chitin of the anterior portion (fig. 2, AntP) of the memlirane 

 is much thinner than is that of the posterior portion. It is quite 

 flexible and for this reason may be easily folded to form the canal. 

 Instead of it being perfectly smooth, a.s is the posterior portion of 

 the membrane, its surface is covered with innumerable minute, 

 narrow, groovelike indentations. These may be comparatively 

 long or short, bent, tortuous, or straight and seemingly extend half 

 way through the chitin. The small lines in fig. 2, c, represent their 

 arrangement and fig. 3 represents a few of them seen under a high 

 magnification. Of course, they are not slits passing entirely through 

 the chitin, but they are grooves and pass about one half through 

 the membrane. 



Looking through the chitin of the posterior portion (fig. 2, PostP) 

 of the articular membrane, at a deeper focus, may be seen many 

 round cells, each of which has a tube that runs to the surface of the 

 membrane. In fig. 2, llo of these tubes with cells are shown, but 

 in all there are from 500 to 600. The majority of the tubes have 

 exits in the chitin between the two heavy veins (figs. 1, Plate XIX, 

 and 2, d and e), but none of them has an exit in the chitin of the 

 anterior portion {AntP) of the mcmliranc. The place where these 

 tubes empty is best seen in fig. 1, Tu. It is thus seen that the tubes 

 unite with the posterior wall of the canal which is formed by the 

 heavy chitin between (/ and c m figs. 1 and 2. The liottom and 

 anterior wall of the canal are formed by the anterior jiortion of the 

 articular membrane. 



Fig. 4 represents four of the cells and several of the tubes seen 

 under a high-power lens, a represents comparatively thin and almost 

 transparent chitin; 6 is a narrow, thick, and yellow liand of ciiitin; 

 c is a thick, semitransparent band of chitin; d is a wiile, thick, and 

 opaque band of chitin; e is thick, semitransparent chitin. It is 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 545 



thus seen that the cells lie beneath the thinnest portion of the chitin 

 belonging to the posterior part of the articular membrane, and that 

 their exits lie in the thickest portion of this chitin. A transparent 

 area (Plate XIX, fig. 4, Amp) was seen in many of the cells, and a 

 tube (fig. 4, Tu) runs into each of these areas. 



In order to study these cells in a living state more carefully, the 

 articular membranes including the tissues adhering to them were 

 removed from worker bees. This material was placed on , a slide 

 in a weak solution of methylin green. The cells adhering to the 

 chitin were teased apart and a few of them with their tubes were 

 separated from the mass of cells and chitin. Such a treatment, 

 however, almost always pulls the internal ends of the tubes out of 

 the cells, whereupon the transparent areas disappear immediately. 

 The tubes are then attached only at their peripheral ends. 



The cells vary considerably in size. They are either spherical 

 or ovoid in shape. Fig. 5 represents one of the largest ovoid cells. 

 It is typical and was drawn with the aid of a camera lucida while 

 still alive, being stained very slightly with methylin green. The 

 large nucleus has a heavy wall, and it "stands out conspicuouslj'. 

 The nucleoli with heavy walls stain green. The cytoplasm in the 

 centre of the nucleus has a faint green color, while that near the 

 periphery of the nucleus is semitransparent. The wall of the cell 

 is thin. The cytoplasm of the cell is more or less transparent. It 

 is granular and appears to have innumerable minute clear spots 

 (CIS). In the broader end of the cell lies the ovoid, transparent 

 area, which may be called the ampulla (Amp). The tube [Tu) 

 terminates at the. centre of the ampulla. The ampulla seems to have 

 many lines or streaks which radiate from the periphery toward the 

 centre, and these radial streaks {RadStr) stop short of the centre and 

 leave a perfectly transparent, ovoid area (TrA) at the centre of 

 the ampulla. 



Judging from the structure of these cells, we must call them 

 gland cells, but when observed hurriedly they may be mistaken for 

 cenocytes. As a rule, the csnocytes are smaller than the gland cells 

 but nevertheless many of them are as large as many of the gland 

 cells. Only a few csnocytes may be found among the mass of gland 

 . cells, but they are quite abundant on all sides of the gland cells- 

 Fig. 6 represents a typical large oenocyte, still alive and stained 

 slightly with a weak .solution of methylin green. The following 

 may be used to distinguish a gland cell from an cenocyte. An 

 oenocyte is never connected with a tube. It never has an ampulla. 




546 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



Its cytoplasm is less granular. It is always partiallj-, and some- 

 times almost totally, filled with globules (Glo). 



Chiefly on account of its size, a fat cell should never be mistaken 

 for a gland cell. Fat cells are always larger, and sometimes several 

 times larger, than these gland cells. They are found on all sides 

 of the mass of gland cells, but seldom among them. Their structure 

 is similar to that of cenocytes, Init the globules are much larger, 

 more conspicuous and are so abundant that the nucleus is scarcely 

 visible. Fig. 7 represents a small fat cell, still alive and stained 

 slightly -uith a weak solution of methylin green. 



To ascertain if the tubes connecting the gland cells with the chitin 

 are composed of chitin, articular membranes removed from the 

 abdomens of workers were placed a few hours into a saturated solu- 

 tion of caustic potash. When all the adhering tissues had disin- 

 tegrated, the membranes were cleaned with water and a pencil 

 brush. In all cases the tubes were left attached to the membranes. 

 This proves that the^y are chitinous. To determine how they 

 terminate in the articular membrane, one of the membranes treated 

 with caustic potash was sectioned. The sections show that the 

 canal of the tube opens freely to the exterior (fig. 8, CanTu). 



Judged by the morphology, we may reasonably conclude that the 

 gland cells secrete a volatile substance throughout their cytoplasm. 

 This substance collects in the ampulla which serves as a reservoir, 

 and from the ampulla it passes through the chitinous tube to the 

 exterior where it runs into the canal. -The groovelike indentations 

 ' in the chitin forming the canal may serve two purposes — (1) to give 

 more flexibility to the chitin, and (2) to retain the volatile secretion 

 and help prevent a too rapid evaporation of it. As long as the 

 abdomen is straight, the canal is well protected and the liquid cannot 

 evaporate rapidly, but when the abdomen is considerably Ijent, 

 the entire canal is more or less exposed to the outside air. 



2. Origin of Gland Cells. 



The scent-producing organs of several 15-day-old worker puptc 

 (counting from the time the eggs were laiti) were sectioned. At 

 this stage the chitin (fig. 9, Ch) is just beginning to be formed, and 

 the hypodermis (fig. 9, Hyp) is very thick. The fat cells (fig. 9, 

 FC) are also not yet completely differentiated. The hy])odennal 

 cells (fig. 9, HypC) are long ant! slender. Most of them near tlie 

 place where the mde and heavy vein (figs. 2, d, and 9, r) is later 

 formed, Ijreak loose from the hypodermal layer and migrate backward 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 547 



till the majority of them lie posterior to the heavy vein. In fig. 

 9, a, a row of them has broken loose from the hypodermal layer and 

 they are assuming the ovoid shape. At fig. 9, b, they are a little 

 farther advanced. In the 16-day-old stage the gland cells (fig. 10, 

 GIC) are much larger and lie just back of the heavy vein (fig. 10, v). 

 Now the chitinous tubes (fig. 10, Tu) are formed and they are con- 

 nected with the gland cells. 



3. Origin of Chitinous Tubes. 



In the 15-day-old stage may occasionally be seen hypodermal 

 cells having processes. Such cells lie at the place where the chitinous 

 tubes later appear. One of these cells (fig. 11a) has a large and 

 conspicuous nucleus. The growing point of the process appears to 

 have no cell wall. Twelve hours later the hypodermal cells (fig. 1 16) 

 forming the tubes have become much smaller, no doubt because of 

 the formation of long processes. It seems that the more the processes 

 grow in length, the more the cells diminish in size. Each hypodermal 

 coll, therefore, must serve as a storehouse for building a tube. When 

 the process is far advanced, its cytoplasm probably begins secreting 

 a substance which in a short time is transformetl into the chitinous 

 tube. In fig. 116 the tube is developed and it is connected with the 

 exterior, but the cytoplasm surrounding the tube has not yet dis- 

 appeared. In a little later stage (fig. He), the cytoplasm surrounding 

 the tube has all disappeared except a small process of the cell. The 

 tube is now connected with a gland cell. 



4. Development of Gland Cells. 



As already stated, the gland cells were originally hypodermal 

 cells (fig. 9, a and b) which migrated from the hypodermal layer. 

 This migration occurs in worker pupae 15 days old. In 16-day-old 

 worker pupse these cells (fig. 10, GIC) are three or four times as large 

 as they are in the 15-day-old stage and they Ijegin to resemble true 

 gland cells. In the 17-day-old stage they are still larger (fig. 12, 

 QIC). Their nuclei are extremely large and stain less densely than 

 does the cytoplasm with Ehrlich's hamatoxylin and eosin. By the 

 ninteenth day the gland cells (fig. 13, GIC) have enlarged but little 

 since the 17-day-old stage. In 21-day-old worker pupse (age at which 

 they emerge from their cells) the gland cells (fig. 14, GIC) seem to be 

 perfectly developed in all respects, except they are only about two- 

 thirds the size of the gland cells (fig. 15, GIC) in old worker bees. 

 36 




548 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



It is quite possible that the gland cells never function until the 

 bee has emerged. It seems reasonable, therefore, to regard the 

 rapid growth which takes place in these cells after the bees have 

 emerged to the fact that the gland cells suddenly begin to function. 



5. Scent-producing Organ of Queen. 



The articular membrane between the fifth and sixth abdominal 

 terga of a queen honey bee is never visible externally, except at the 

 instant when she bends her alxlomen to sting an object beneath her. 

 Several of these articular membranes of queens were excised and 

 were examined in the same manner as already related for those of 

 workers. Gland cells and chitinous tubes are present in the same 

 position and arrangement as they are in workers. 



All the uther articular membranes between the abdoiniiial terga 

 in queens and workers were examined, but no chitinous tubes nor 

 gland cells were fovuTcl. 



The gland cells (fig. 1(5<() in adult queens are at least one-third 

 larger than are those in adult workers (fig. 15, GIC) and in fixed and 

 stained sections they have the same structure. The gland cells 

 (fig. 16b) in pupae of queens also have the same structure as those in 

 pupae of workers. 



6. Does a Drone have a Scent-producing ()rg.\n? 



All the artic-ular membranes between the abdominal lerga of 

 several drones were excised and carefully examined. At no time did 

 the writer ever find chitinous tubes attached to any one of these 

 membranes and he never saw any cells adhering to the meml>ranes 

 which resemble the gland cells already described. This does not mean 

 that drones do not have any scent-])roducing organs, liecause other 

 parts of the bodj^ ami all the appendages were not examined for 

 glandular structures. Scent-prodvlcing organs in males of .several 

 other insects have been described, so that such an organ may still 

 be found in drones. 



Sometimes when the abdomens of yovmg drones are slightly 

 srjueezed, a very thin and whitish lic]uid may be seen on the alxloiiiinal 

 articular membranes. At other times a clear liquid may be observed 

 on the articular membranes, particularly on those between the 

 fourth and fifth, and fifth and sixth abdominal terga. This clear 

 li(|uid has a saline taste, and in this respect resembles the blood of 

 drones.

7. Discussion. 



A discussion of all the literature available pertaining to the scent- 

 producing organ-! of insects has been prepared, but since such a 

 long discussion cannot be presented here, only a brief outline will 

 be given. 



A review of the literature shows that the substance produced by 

 any scent-producing organ is secreted by unicellular glands which 

 as far as known are modified hypodermal cells. For description, 

 scent-producing organs may be di^^ded into five types based on their 

 devices for disseminating the odor and for storing the secretion as 

 follows: (1) No special device for disseminating the odor or storing 

 the secretion; (2) gland cells associated with hairs and scales as a 

 means of scattering the odor more effectively; (3) "evaginable" 

 sacs lined with hairs connected with gland cells as a device for storing 

 and distributing the odor; (4) articular membranes serving as 

 pouches for storing ami preventing a too rapid evaporation of the 

 secretion; (5) specialized tubes and sacs acting as reservoirs for 

 storing and discharging the secretion. 



The first type is the simplest of all five types. It is best repre- 

 sented as unicellular glantls uniformly distributed over the entire 

 body surface as found in some beetles (Tower, 1903). In the laeetles 

 Dytiscus and Acilius unicellular glands lie just beneath the hypo- 

 dcrmis Ix-tween the heatl and tergite of the prothorax (Plateau, 1876). 

 In the blister beetle, Meloe, are found unicellular glands beneath 

 the hypodermis on both sides of the femoro-tibial articulations 

 (Berlese, 1909). These gland cells are similar in structure to those 

 of the honey bee. Beneath the femoro-tibial articulation in Cam- 

 poiiolKfi and the tihio-tarsal articulation in Formica, Schon (1911) 

 found unicellular glands. Beneath the hypodermis of the caruncles 

 of the Indian roach, Corydia, lie ilnicellular glands, also similar to 

 those of the bee (Klemensiewicz, 1882). In this type of scent- 

 proflucing organ the secretion passes through the chitinous tubes 

 to the exterior where it spreads over the surface of the chitin sur- 

 rounding the exits of the tubes. 



In regard to spreading the secretion over a wider area, the second 

 type is much more highly developed than is the first type. This is 

 accomplished in most cases by the secretion spreading over the 

 surfaces of many large hairs arranged in tufts which may be expanded 

 into a fan-shaped figure. The hind tibiae of the male moth Hepialus 

 hecta are greatly swollen and are almost filled with large unicellular 




550 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Aug., 



glands, each of which communicates with a spatula-shaped hair 

 (Bertkau, 1882). In the male moth Phassus schamyl the hairs are 

 scalelike with the distal end of each scale divided into two or three 

 lobes (Deegener, 1905). The same kind of organ is found in the 

 male moths Syrichthus malum and Pechipogon.barbalis (lUig, 1902). 

 In the latter species, instead of there being a tuft of hairs on each 

 hind tibia, each front tibia bears three tufts. In the male moth 

 Sphinx convolvuli a pair of lateral tufts of scalelike hairs is found at 

 the proximal end of the abdomen (Tozzetti, 1870). In the female 

 moths Taximatopoca pinivora and StUpnotia salids the scent-producing 

 organ is a large paired tuft of hairs on both sides ami above the anus 

 (Freiling, 1909). In many male butterflies, the scent scales on the 

 wings serve as scent-producing organs (Midler, 1877). Each scale 

 is connected with a unicellular gland (Thomas, 1893; Illig, 1902). 

 In the second type of scent-producing organ, the secretion from the 

 gland cells passes into the hairs and scales and then s])reads over 

 their surfaces, whereby the odor from the secretion is more effectively 

 disseminated. 



In regard to storing the odor in an "evaginable" sac, (lie third 

 type is a little farther advanced than the second ty]ie. In the male 

 butterflies Ddnnis and I'Jnphni the scent-])roducing organ consists 

 of two large chitinous invaginated sacs, lined with scaleliU(> hairs. 

 One of these sacs lies on eilher siile of Ihe abdomen and ojiens between 

 the seventh and eighth sterna (lliig, 1902). In tiie female liuttertly 

 Gonopleryx rhamni this organ is a single'invaginated sac, i>ut in tiie 

 female of Euphm it consists of a circle of scalelike hairs around the 

 anus and of a pair of invaginated sacs, lined with hairs as usual 

 (Freiling, 1909). Each hair is connected with a unicellular glaml. 

 The sacs are evaginated by blootl jiressure and retracted l)v muscles. 

 It is thus seen that the oilorous substance may be more or less 

 retained in the invaginated sacs, but when the sacs are evaginated, 

 like the fingers of a glove, all the odor escapes. 



In regard to storing the secretion, the foiu'th tyju' is mori' liighiy 

 organized than any one of the jireceding types of scent-producing 

 organs. In tiie roach Pcriplaiuta orinildliK this organ consists of a 

 pair of shallow pouches in the articular membrane lietween the 

 fifth and sixth abdominal terga. The pouches are covered by the 

 fifth terguni, hut open to the exterior by a pair of slit-shaped open- 

 ' ings. They are lined with hairs, each of which connects with a 

 unicellular gland (Minchin, 1888). In the sexually matured male 

 roach Phyllodromia germanica there are two double pouches, one 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 551 



of which is located in the articular membrane between the fifth and 

 sixth and the other between the sixth and seventh abdominal terga. 

 These pouches are not lined with hairs. The tubes from the uni- 

 cellular glands carry the secretion directly to the pouch where it is 

 forced to the e.xterior by muscles constricting the lumen of the pouch 

 (Oettinger, 1906). In the female moth Orgyia antiqua the scent- 

 producing organ is a shallow pouch in the articular membrane 

 between the eighth and ninth abdominal terga. The unicellular 

 glands lie in groups like several bunches of grapes just beneath the 

 thin membrane. Freiling (1909) saw no tubes connecting the 

 gland cells with this membrane. He thinks that the secretion 

 passes through the membrane by infiltration. In tlie petiole of 

 the worker ant of Myrmicn rubra, Janet (1898) found an invaginated 

 chamber. At the bottom of the chamber may be seen the exits of 

 the tubes which lead to the bunch of unicellular glands. He also 

 found in the same ant two small groups of unicellular glamls l)eneath 

 the articular membrane between the ninth and tenth abdominal 

 terga. These glands are also connected with tubes which run to 

 the exterior. Both of these organs may possibly be scent-producdng 

 organs. The wax glands of young worker bees may also have such 

 a function. Each of these unicellular glands is nothing more than 

 a hypodermal cell modified for secreting a substance which passes 

 through many minute pores in the thick chitin of the abdominal 

 segment. After coming in contact with th(> external air the substance 

 changes to wax. In Apis these glands lie beneath the second, 

 third, fourth, and fifth abdominal sterna, hi McHpona beneath the 

 last four abdominal terga, in Trigona beneath the last five abdominal 

 terga, but in Bombus beneath Ixjth the abdominal sterna and terga 

 (Dreyling, 1906). 



The scent-producing organ of the honey bee belongs to the fourth 

 type, and it is probably the most highly developed organ of this type. 

 Nassonoff thought that the chitinous tubes ran into the bottom of 

 the canal, chiefly formetl by the anterior portion of the articular 

 membrane, instead of them uniting with the posterior wall of the 

 canal. If they vmttcd with the bottom of the canal, they would 

 materially affect the flexilnlity of the memlirane. Zoubareff (1883) 

 imagines that the gland cells in this organ of the bee secrete the 

 little drops of liciuid which bees are said to let fall when flying. He 

 thinks that these drops represent the excess of water contained in 

 freshly gathered nectar over that in ripened honey. 



In regard to storing and discharging the secretion as a means of 




552 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEilY OF [Aug., 



defence, the fifth type of scent-producing organ is the most highly 

 organized of all five types. For storing the secretion, the ear-wig 

 has two pairs of reservoirs in the third antl fourth abdominal terga 

 (Vossler, 1890). Both sexes of walking-.sticks have two straight, 

 rihhonlike blind sacs which lie in the thorax (Scudder, 1876). The 

 electric-light bug has two long ccecal tubes in the metathorax (Leidy, 

 1847) . In another bug, Pijrrhocoris apterus, the scent-producing organ 

 is quite complicated. It has a specialized reservoir ^ath a valve to 

 prevent the escape of the secretion (Mayer, 1874). The male 

 roaches Periplaneta orientalis and P. americana have, besides the scent- 

 jiroducing organ in the articular membrane already mentioned, 

 anal glands which are highly organized (Bordas, 1901). The uni- 

 cellular glands belonging to the anal glands of a beetle, Blaps mortisaga, 

 are very similar in structure to those of the bee (Gilson, 1889). 

 Many species of Carabidae and DytiscidiE have been studied by 

 Dierckx (1899). He finds that all their anal glands are highly 

 organized and that the secretion is produced by many unicellular 

 glands which lie either in tlie tubes leading to the reservoir or lie a 

 short distance from these tubes. All of the gland cells are quite 

 similar in structure to those of the bee. A highly organized anal 

 gland has also been found in a few ants (Forel, 1878). 



From this brief outline, it is seen tliat scent-producing organs 

 have already been found in many insects belonging to five orders. 

 There is a wide variation in organization between the lowest type 

 and the highest type. All of those organ-^ belonging to the first 

 four types are used in all probability for alluring purposes and as a 

 means for recognition, while those of the fifth type are perhaps used 

 onl>' as a mean^ of defence. Of the scent-iiroduciug organ-; used for 

 recognition, that of the honey bee is probatily the most highly 

 organized.

FURTHER NOTES ON METEOR CRATER. ARIZONA. 

 BY DANIEL MOREAU BARRINGER. 



I present this as a supplement to my paper, entitled "Coon 

 Mountain and Its Crater," published in the Proceedings of The 

 Acailemy of Natural Science.s of Philadelphia in December, 1905, 

 and to my more comprehensive and necessarily more accurate paper 

 (owins to the amount of exploration work which has been done), 

 read before the National Academy of Sciences at its autumn meeting 

 at Princeton University, November 16, 1909, with a few additional 

 and apparently conclusive arguments with regard to the correctness 

 of the impact theory of origin of what is now known as the Meteor 

 Crater of Arizona. 



One of the most significant minor facts in connection with this 

 remarkable crater is the discovery by those who have conducted the 

 extensive exploratory work there of quite large quantities of quartz 

 glass, which is undoubtedly fused sandstone and has been so de- 

 scribed by Merrill.' An examination of the specimens now on 

 exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History, New Yoi'k, 

 will immediately convince the most skeptical that this is nothing 

 but fused sandstone. 



It does not appear that those who have written on the interesting 

 suljject of the origin of this crater in Arizona, myself inchuled. have 

 used this fact, and the circumstance that the material is abundantly 

 stained with nickel-iron oxide, as a conclusive argument — for such it 

 is — in favor of the impact theory rather than thv volcanic theory of 

 origin. I am assured by Dr. IMerrill and others that there is no 

 record of a sudden outburst of volcanic action wherein the heat 

 generated was sufficient to fuse crystalline ([uartz. The only ca.se 

 of quartz being fused by a sudden rise in temperature to the necessary 

 degree of heat to effect a result comjiarable to that produced here 

 is that of the more or less familiar action of the lightning striking 

 sandstone or sand and altering it to what is known as fulgurite 

 glass. No volcanic action, however violent or however long con-

 phosed sandstone in my National .\cadeniy paper. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 557 



tinued, has been known to produce such an effect. The only com- 

 parison which occurs to me and which will at all fit the facts is 

 that of the striking of a heavj' armor-piercing projectile upon armor 

 plate. There, I understand, a very high heat is generated moment- 

 arily, as was certainly the case at the Arizona crater. There also 

 the heat of impact is sufficient to not only fuse a small portion of 

 the target, but a small portion of the projectile, since momentarily 

 iron-and-nickel vapor is producetl. That this vapor of iron and 

 nickel was also produced at the crater, being deriveil from the 

 impacting body, is evidenced by the fact that this particular variety 

 of fused sandstone, referred to by me as "Variety B" of metamor- 

 phosed sandstone in my National Academy paper, is nearly always 

 more or less abundantly stained by iron and nickel oxide. The 

 fact that this stain is often found in places where the metamorphosed 

 sandstone has gaped open under the influence of intense heat and 

 then closed again upon cooling, is most significant. 



Now it must not be forgotten that the white or gray saccharoidal 

 sandstone, small portions of which have been fused in this way, 

 does not outcrop anywhere nearer than the Grand Canyon of the 

 Colorado, seventy miles distant, where it is known as the White 

 Wall or Cross-bedded sandstone and overlies, as at Meteor Crater, 

 the Red Wall or Red Beds sandstone. At the crater the upper 

 portion of this sandstone occupies a position about 350 feet below 

 the surface of the plain, being overlaid by about 300 feet of the 

 Aubrey limestone and 40 or 50 feet of the purplish-red sandstone, 

 which, in the form of small buttes, is found all over the surrounding 

 otherwise almost level plain. It must be remembered also that all 

 the strata in this locality are horizontal. Clearly, nickeliferous 

 iron had penetrated into and, as we now have strong reason to 

 believe, through this bed of white or gray sandstone, and we know 

 that nothing terrestrial in this vicinity contains nickel in any form. 

 The only possible source of this stain is, therefore, the meteoric iron, 

 the occurrence of which has been very fully described in my previous 

 papers. (See Plate XXIII, showing the distribution of meteoric 

 iron around the crater.) It seems to me, therefore, that this 

 peculiar vesicular form of metamorphosed sandstone, which was 

 certainly produced by sudden and intense heat and which is so 

 abundantly stained with nickel and iron oxide, in itself furnishes an 

 incontrovertible proof of the impact theory of origin, the opinion 

 of certain members of the United States Geological Survey to the 

 contrary notwithstanding. 




558 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



Professor Elihu Thomson has given me permission to quote a 

 statement which he made to me in a letter written a few claj's after 

 he visited the crater some years ago, as follows: "This Arizona 

 crater bears all the evidences of impact and the evidences of nothing 

 else." This is the complete story told in a few words. It will 

 be in the interest of science if scientific men, and especially those of 

 the United States Geological Survey who deny this theory of origin, 

 will present their reasons for maintaining the hypothesis that the 

 crater was due to some manifestation of volcanic activity. I believe 

 that it will be easy to refute any argument they may advance. No 

 examination of the crater since the exploratory work was done has 

 been made by any members of the Survey, to the best of my knowl- 

 edge and belief. Therefore, unless they can satisfactorily account 

 for the facts which I have stated in this and in my previous papers 

 on the subject on some other theory than that of impact by a great 

 mass of meteoric iron, it would seem that I can fairly claim to have 

 proved the theory that the crater was formed by this agency. 



There is good reason to believe that the meteoric mass was a 

 dense cluster of iron meteorites and possibly was the head of a small 

 comet which was not moving at very high speed, astronomically 

 considered, since there is no evidence, beyond the very slight evi- 

 dence referred to above, of the volatilization of any portion of the 

 mass. Moreover, it is certain that the siliceous limestone bed, which 

 it encountered after passing through the 40 to 50 feet of overlying 

 l)urpli-^li-nil sandstone, woulH have. been readily fused had the 

 ini|)act been such as we can reasonalily suppose it to have been had 

 there been a head-on collision between this small cluster of iron 

 meteorites or cometary body and the earth. Besides this, as anj'one 

 wlio knows anything about l)allistics will at once acknowledge, there 

 would liave lieen no such penetration as we now know took place: 

 nearly, if not fully, 1,200 feet into solid limestone and sandstone 

 strata. It has been inferred, therefore, that the cluster of iron 

 meteorites may have followed after the earth and that the blow de- 

 livered was not such as it would iiave been if there had been a direct 

 head-on collision, ^^'e now know that the mass, j^robably weighing 

 as much as 10,01)0,000 tons, if not more, penetrated through the 

 white or gray sandstone and as far down as the top of the Red Beds 

 sandstone (Red Wall sandstone of the Grand Canyon section). 

 Several cores from this sandstone bed, showing it to be undisturbed 

 and lying in a horizontal position, have been brought up by the 

 drill dircctlv under the centre of the floor of the crater and at a 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 559 



depth of from 900 feet to over 1,000 feet below the floor of the crater. 

 They are to be seen at the American Musemn of Natural History, 

 New York. 



Only a small ami unfortunately the central portion of the crater 

 has been e.xploretl by the drill, not more than yV of the total area of 

 the crater, but undoubted meteoric material (small pieces of "iron 

 shale" or magnetic nickel-iron oxide) have been brought up by the 

 drill, as stated in my jjrevious papers, from a depth of between 700 

 and 800 feet below the level of the floor of the crater, which is 

 about 440 feet, on an average, below the level of the surrounding 

 plain. The drill holes were located there because we did not at the 

 time this drilling was done appreciate the direction from which the 

 meteoric mass approached or properly interpret the evidence which 

 now causes us to believe that it lies under the southern wall of the 

 crater, some 2,000 feet distant from where the drilling was done. 

 We did not take into consideration certain facts now very plain to 

 us and to anyone who may visit the crater or carefully study the 

 maps, once his attention is called to these facts, which should have 

 shown us that it approached at cjuite an angle from tlic north, per- 

 haps as much as 30° from the vertical. 



In the first place, the greatest amount of iron meteorites and 

 especially those of the "shale ball" variety, described in my previous 

 papers, have been found on the northern slope of the crater and on 

 the plain beyond — accurately, slightly to the east of a north and south 

 line passing through the centre of the crater. In this connection it 

 may be of some interest to know that there was found about a mile 

 and a half from the crater in a north-northeast direction three years 

 ago the largest Canyon Diablo iron meteorite which has ever been 

 found. The following are the dimensions of this meteorite, which 

 is of the ordinary Canyon Diablo type, with characteristic pittings, 

 etc.: 



Length .3' 2" 



Width 2' 5" 



Height 1' Zh" 



Greatest circumference 8' 31" 



Least circumference '.. 5' 7" 



Estimated weight Between 1,700 and 2,000 pounds. 



It is to be seen at the musemn- which has been l:)uilt at the crater. 



^ The collection of meteorites, metamorphosed sandstone, specimens of all 

 the strata penetrated, etc., in this museum and in the collection at the American 

 Museum of Natural History, in New York City, which has been loaned to it 

 by Princeton University, should be seen by all those who are interested in the 

 subject. 




560 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [i^ept-, 



Secondly, vastly more of the fragmentary material, including 

 that which came from its greatest depths, which has been expelled 

 from the crater by the force of the impact, lies on the southern rim 

 than anj-where else. 



Other proofs that the meteoric mass which produced the crater 

 by its impact with the earth approached from this direction are 

 that in the south wall of the crater, composed of great limestone and 

 sandstone cliffs, the fact is clearly discernible that this sandstone 

 and limestone have been lifted vertically some 105 feet out of 

 position for a total length of nearly one-half mile. On either 

 side of this great uplift the formations are tilted violently back- 

 ward, a fault separating them from the central uplifted mass (see 

 Plates XXI and XXII). Moreover, a distinct bending or arch can 

 be seen in the lines of stratificaticm of the rocks composing this 

 central mass which has been vertically uplifteil and which proliably 

 weighs in the neighborhood of 50,000,000 tons. The highest point 

 of this curvature is in the exact centre or midway between the point 

 where the strata have been turned backward, as described. This 

 would seem to indicate that something was wedged or intrudetl 

 underneath this great mass of rock and lifted it vertically upward. 

 The central portion of this mass of rock so uplifted is almost due 

 south of the centre of the crater or nearly opposite to that portion of 

 the crater's rim and the ])lain Iseyond on which the greatest number 

 of ordinary Canyon Diablo meteorites and the so-called "shale 

 ball" meteorites have been found. Afeo beginning at the north the 

 strata exposed in the circular wall of the crater increase in the dip 

 representing their backward tilting on each side of tlie crater right 

 around to the faults which mark the east and west .sides of this up- 

 lifted mass (see Plates XXI and XXII). ' When these facts are consid- 

 ered in connection with that of the great fragmentary masses of lime- 

 stone being collected together in what I have heretofore referred to 

 as "fields of limestone boulders," which lie to the east and west of a 

 north and south line passing through the crater, conviction is forced 

 upon the mind that the mass which made the crater, and which 

 according to our present knowledge of physics and chemistry must 

 lie someM'here in its depths, apiM"oached the earth from a northerly 

 direction and held to its course as a rifle bullet would until perhaps 

 it came to the top of the hard Red Beds sandstone stratum, when 

 possibly it may have been deflected somewhat. A]5parently, how- 

 ever, it advanced sufficiently far underneath the white or gray 

 sandstone and the overlying limestone to uplift the portion of the 




1914.] NATURAL .SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 561 



wall of the crater referred to above more than 100 feet out of its 

 proper position. What could be more natural under these conditions 

 than that we would have found nothing in the centre of the crater 

 except some little pieces of iron oxide representing largely sparks 

 or bits of metal which were literally torn off the projectile as it 

 advanced through the rock target? By far the greater portion of it 

 must have held together, as a charge of shot holds together for a 

 short distance after it leaves the muzzle of a shotgun. It is con- 

 sidered extremely likely that the major portion of the mass lies 

 under the southern wall of the crater and particularly under that 

 portion of it which has been uplifted in the manner that I have 

 attempted to describe. 



The theorj' has been advanced that this great crater was par- 

 tially formed by the heating of the water in the moist sandstone 

 converting it almost instantly into steam. I have no doubt that 

 this action contributed in a measure to excavate the crater, but 

 I do not think that it contributed very largely to the general effect. 

 It seems to me that it is hardly necessary to call in any other agency 

 to account for the observed facts than the excavating effect of such 

 a projectile. In short I believe the crater would have been prac- 

 tically as large as it is to-day if there had been no water in the sand- 

 stone. We well know from repeated Ijorings by the Atchison, 

 Topeka & Santa Fe R. R. Company that these strata contain very 

 little water to-day and all the evidence is in favor of the crater's 

 being of recent origin, the Indians of that section having a legend 

 connected with the fall. 



Having once been convinced of the correctness of the impact 

 theory of origin, the size of the meteoric mass which formed the pro- 

 jectile becomes of interest. It is hardly conceivable that its weight 

 was less than five million tons. It may have been 10,000,000 tons, 

 or twice that weight. Admitting that it was a cluster that produced 

 the result, the wonder is that it was as small as we now realize it 

 must have been. These masses of meteoric material we know to be 

 flying through space in the vicinity of our solar system. They pos- 

 sil^ly represent the small remaining portions of the nebula out of 

 which our system was made. Most of them have probably long 

 since been gathered into the sun or into some of the planetary- bocUes. 

 Saturn's rings, I believe, are largely composed of meteorites. They 

 probably present an eai'ly stage of moon-making. The craters on the 

 moon's surface are much more thinkable in size than the Arizona crater. 

 Mo.st of the craters on the moon's surface, which I firmly believe to 




562 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF f^ept., 



be impact craters, are vastly larger than our Arizona crater, and 

 one of them is even 150 miles in diameter. When one who is familiar 

 with the Arizona crater examines the lunar craters through a good tele- 

 scope they are at once seen to show the main features of the former. 

 The relation of width to depth is the same. Most of the ejected 

 material lies close around the lunar craters and forms the so-called 

 rim, as in the case of the Arizona crater. There are spurts or tongues 

 of ejected material in the Arizona crater and presumably in the lunar 

 craters. Even the peculiar conical central hill or mountain which is 

 observed in most of them and which I confidently assert cannot 

 be explained on any theory of volcanic action, has its counter- 

 part in our own Silica Hill at Meteor Crater (see Plates XXI 

 and XXII). It probablj^ exists in all of the lunar craters, but 

 in the very small ones it is not easily discernible on account of 

 the smallness of the crater and because, as in our crater, the effect 

 has been somewhat masked. This hill in the Arizona crater is now 

 somewhat masked by' the overlying lacustrine sediments and by 

 fine material deposited by the action of wind over it. For a long 

 time its origin puzzled us greatly. It now seems to have been a neces- 

 sary feature of the impact. These central conical hills or veritable 

 mountains in the larger lunar craters would seem to be due to the 

 same physical law vvhich we see in operation when we tlrop a stone 

 into water or soft mud, with which solid rock can be com]5ared 

 if the projectile strikes it at sufficient speed. A raindrop falling 

 on still water produces for a moment the same small conical-shape 

 in the centre of the cavity caused by the impact. In the case of 

 water, of course, it soon mingles with the surrounding water; in the 

 case of rock fragments or rather stilif mud it remains. In this connec- 

 tion one should reatl A Stiidy nf Splnshcx, by Professor W. A. Worth- 

 ington, of Dcvonport, England, in which the author has introduced 

 some quite wonderful photographs and arrived at certain conclusions 

 with regard to the Ijchavior and flow of solid substances under great 

 pressure, suddenly a])plied, being analogous to the motion set up 

 in liquids or viscous material Upon impact. These conclusions 

 seem to be fully warranted and also seem to go far toward ex- 

 plaining the presence of the conical-shajied hills in nearly all of 

 the lunar craters. Anyone who will make a careful study of our 

 Arizona crater and will then read Worthington's book, studying the 

 diagrams he has made, and will then turn his attention to the lunar 

 craters, cannot escape the conviction that the lunar craters are im- 

 pact craters. Why the moon should have been so abundantly boni-

l:)arded and the earth so seldom bomlmrded durint)- recent geological 

 history is seemingly difficult to e.xplain, but one nuist not forget that 

 the moon has been without an atmosphere for perhaps a great many 

 million years and all the bombardment to which it has been subjected 

 during this vast period of time is clearly and permanently recorded. 



May it not be possible that when one holds in his hands one of 

 the meteorites that occasionally reach this earth and which reached 

 it on its present surface in far greater numbers at and around Meteor 

 Crater in Arizona than any other locality knowai to us, he is holding 

 in his hands something older than our sun or any of the planets which 

 revolve about it; in fact, that he is holding in his hands something 

 which has literally formed part of the nebula out of which our whole 

 solar sy.stem has been built up? If this, be in accordance with the 

 facts it would help to confirm the more recent theories of the building 

 up of the planetary systems as put forward by Chamberlin and 

 Moulton. 



It seems to me to be not inappropriate to bring this paper to a 

 close by quoting in substance an argument which I recently heard 

 used by Dean W. F. Magie, Professor of Physics at Princeton Uni- 

 versity, in favor of the impact theory of origin of the Arizona crater 

 and as against the steam explosion theory of origin, which has lieen 

 advanced and persisted in notwithstanding all the evidence jire- 

 sented in the many papers which have been written on the suliject 

 since the publication of my first paper read before The Academy of 

 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Dean Magie spent a fortnight 

 at Meteor Crater several years ago studying the various phenomena 

 in connection with the crater and carefully checking the statements 

 of fact made by me in the National Academy paper above referred 

 to. The argument is as follows: 



First, on the doctrine of probabilities, the chances are one in 

 many millions that the greatest known shower of iron meteorites 

 should have fallen on the exact spot, with the Arizona crater as. the 

 centre of its distribution (by consulting Plate XXIII it will be noticed 

 that the meteorites increase in number as one approaches the crater) , 

 at which a single, unprecedented steam explosion on a rapidly 

 revolving earth occurred. 



Secondly, that the chances are one in many more millions that 

 this shower should have fallen on the exact site chosen for such an 

 unprecedented steam exj^losion at the same instant of time that the 

 steam explosion occurred. 



Thirdly, that tlie chances are again one in millions that the steam 




•564 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Sept., 



explosion should have produced not only Huch a peculiarly sym- 

 metrical crater as has been described in the various papers which 

 have been recently written concerning it, but should have produced 

 one which fiu-nishes so much other evidence strongly confirming 

 the theory of impact as against the theorj- of steam explosion. 



Consequently, it is perfectly fair mathematically to multiply these 

 three and for one to sa3', on the theory of probabilities, that the 

 •chances are one in the product of all these millions that the crater 

 was formed by a steam explosion. This of course is negligible.

MORPHOLOGIC SEQUENCES IN THE CANALICULATE FULGUKS. 

 BY BURNETT SMITH. 



Tlie Tertian- and Recent gastropods which are usually assigned 

 to the genus Fulgur or to the genera Fulgur and Sycotypus have been 

 studied on several occasions in the endeavor to clear up the phylo- 

 genetic relationships of the different species. Inexact methods of 

 collecting, poorly preserved material, and uncertainty of stratigraphic 

 relations have perhaps contributed in no small degree to the con- 

 flicting interpretations which have resulted. In spite of tlie attention 

 which these forms have attracted, no detailed morphologic work has, 

 so far, ])een attempted in the group. The purpose of the present 

 paper is to record some of the changes exhibited by the canaliculate 

 division of the genus when traced throughout its geological and 

 geographical range. 



The following notes have been prepared after an examination of 

 well-preserved specimens whose localities and horizons are in most 

 cases known to have been determined with considerable accuracy. 

 Museum sets of individuals falling well within a single specific diagno- 

 sis have been omitted whenever there was a suspicion that they were 

 derived from more than one locality' or from more than one horizon. 

 It is recognized, however, that the amount of collecting necessary 

 for a final settlement of these problems of phylogeny is far beyond 

 the resources and the time of any one individual. Conclusions 

 reached in these notes are therefore submitted with the full realization 

 that they are preliminarj- in character and limited in scope. 



In even so simple a structure as the gastropod shell there are too 

 many features to be taken in and appreciated at a single glance,, and 

 when a number of gradational forms are viewed together it is seldom 

 possible to retain any definite mental image in passing from one 

 extreme to the other of a morphologic sequence. True, it can be 

 seen by the most casual inspection that many species are closely 

 allied, but to say how they are allied is tjy no means an easy matter. 

 The chief obstacles encountered in such work are those presented 

 (1) by multiplicity of morphologic characters, (2) by the inadequacy 

 of words to express the requisite shades of meaning, and (3) bj- the 

 difficulty of representing a transitional ontogenetic stage in a diagram. 




568 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AC.UDEMY OF [Oct., 



In spite of their shortcomings it is believed that diagrams give a 

 closer approximation to the truth than verbal descriptions and can 

 be employed to greater advantage if their limitations are understood. 



Though fully appreciating the necessity for the correct use of 

 systematic terras, the author wishes to emphasize the point that the 

 present study has not for its object the comparison of species as 

 ordinarily understood, but the comparison and correlation of the 

 morphologic combinations exhibited by the majority of individuals 

 of communities or races. 



Wherever practicable, the forms examined have been compared 

 with type specimens. When this could not be done satisfactorily 

 it has been the policy to refer, if possible, to some good figure of a 

 specimen whose horizon and locality are known. Though this latter 

 method may i)erhaps increase the chances of confusion among names, 

 it is believed that it lessens the chances of confusing morphologic 

 units. 



In the group of gastropods under discussion the shell cliaracters 

 most available for comparison are the sutural canal, the nodes on 

 the shoulder angle, and the shoulder-angle keel. Tlie appearance 

 and disappearance, strength or weakness, persistence or the reverse 

 of these characters have been used in comjjaring one race or sj^ecies 

 with another. Decortication in many fossils and mechanical al:)rasion 

 in most recent specimens have usually oliscured the minute details 

 of the first and second whorls. It is therefore not possible to compare 

 here every ontogenetic stage, but it can-'be stated that the sequence 

 of ontogenetic stages for the grou]) apjiears to be (1) a smooth and 

 rounded stage, (2) a short cancellated and rounded stage, (3) an 

 angulated and noded stage, (4) an angulated and keeled stage without 

 nodes, and (5) a final rounded stage in which only the faintest spiral 

 striiE remain. 



In the present study, as mentioned above, the last three stages 

 are, together with the canal, the most useful for comijarative purposes. 

 It is unfortunate that it is not practicable to extend the comparisons 

 in detail to the first and second whorls, but the nodes are usually 

 much obscured on the second whorl, while the cancellated stage is 

 known to the author in only one fossil race. Its presence, though 

 not proved, is suspected nevertheless for the entire group of canalicu- 

 late Fulgurs. 



In order to restrict, as far as pu.ssible, the verbal description of 

 each feature in each whorl of each race, it is deemed advisable to 

 present the diagrams first and allow them to serve as a guide to the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 569- 



explanations that may follow. The purpose of the diagram is to 

 picture the persistence or the reverse of the different characters in 

 passing from the early to the late whorls, that is, throughout the 

 ontogeny of tlie average individual' of a race. The heavy horizontal 

 line of the diagram represents the ontogeny. Tt might be described 

 as a linear representation of that which in the shell is spiral: — the 

 spiral shell unwound, if we may use such an expression. Above 

 this line the ontogenetic stages are marked off as follows: 



A. The smooth and rounded stage.* 



X. The noded stage. 



K. The keeled stage without well defined nodes. 



R. The final rounded stage. 



The ontogenetic range of the sutural canal is shown below the 

 heavy line mentioned. The vertical dotted lines delimit the different 

 whorls and the spaces between them are numbered accordingly. 



It has been found by measurement that (due to ventricose coiling) 

 the length of the shoulder on any one whorl is about twice as great 

 as that on the preceding whorl. This, though not mathematically 

 correct, is believed to be so close an approximation to the truth that 

 the diagrams can be constructed in this manner. Whorl seven is 

 accordingly sho\Mi as twace as long as whorl six, and this proportion. 

 is maintained down to the third whorl. (See tables on p. 570.) 



The Coron.\tum-pyrum Sequence. 



The sutural canal or channel which is such a prominent character 

 in our two Recent species of canaliculate Fulgurs and whicli is 

 usually selected as the chief diagnostic feature of the genus or sub- 

 genus Sycotypus had its beginnings at least as early as the Ballast 

 Point Oligocene. It is here, as pointed out by DalF, more "of an 

 individual than a racial or specific character, Imt it is none the less 

 present, and in any account of the canaliculate Fulgurs one must 

 not fail to mention those Florida specimens which are provided With 

 the shell structure in question.. They are usually assigned (see 

 A. N. S. P., No. 10,514) to Fulgnr spiniger (Conrad), but their rather 

 wide divergence from the type of that species is made evident by a com- 



' It cannot be too .strongly emphasized that the tabulated results are intended 

 to apply only to those specimens which are regarded as average. In every race 

 or species individuals may be selected which e.xhibit either .more or less accelera- 

 tion of shell characters than does the average example. 



- In the diagrams the cancellated stage when known to be present is included 

 with stage A.

parison with tlie figure which accompanies the original description.'' 

 They are without doubt a very primitive expression of the canalicu- 

 late type, but entire individuals of the series are all of small size, and 

 the suspicion that they are not fully grown has prevented the author 

 from including them in the tables with mature examples of other 

 species. It is therefore considered better to begin the discussion of 

 morphologic sequences with a later though perhaps eciually primitive 

 form — Fulgur coronatum Conrad^ — from the St. Mary's Miocene. 



The most striking secjuence starting with this species terminates 

 with a form from the Caloosahatchie Pliocene of Florida, which is 

 usually included in Fulgur pynim (Dilhvj'ii). The steps in the 

 sequence are F. coronatum Conrad (St. Mary's Miocene), F". ragosum 

 Conrad^ (St. Mary's Miocene), F. canaliculatum (L.y (Maryland 

 Pleistocene), F. pyrum (Dillwyn)* (Recent Florida), and F. pyrum 

 (Dillwyn) (Florida Pliocene). These are all showii in Table I. 

 Pleistocene specimens of F. canaliculatum have been selected because 

 their preservation is superior to that of the available Recent speci- 

 mens. It should also be noted that the ontogeny line which has 

 been introduced for the Recent F. pyrum cannot be used to represent 

 all individuals of the species.^ 



On consulting the table it will be seen that the sequence consists 

 (1) in the progressively earlier appearance of the canal in passing 

 from F. coronatum to the Caloosahatchie F. pyrum, (2) the progress- 

 ive shortening of the noded stage through compression of the stage 

 and acceleration of its later part, (3) the introduction and progressive 

 acceleration of the keeled stage and its final compression in the 

 terminal member of the sequence, and (4) the introduction of a final 

 rounded stage in the Caloosahatchie F. pynnn^" accompanied by 

 compression and acceleration of the noded and keeled stages. 



However little this arrangement may conform to geologic order 

 or to one's ideas of phylogenetic relationship, it must be admitted that

these forms just enumerated exhibit actual morphologic gradations. 

 Any one feature is just a little stronger or more accelerated or perlsaps 

 just a little weaker in passing from F. coronatuin to the Pliocene 

 F. pyrum — in other words, the sequence is morphologic. 



That the actual specimens from which these tabulated results 

 were obtained could constitute part of a ])hylogcnetic sequence is, 

 of eour.se, inadmissible. The specimens of F. coronatum and F. 

 rugosum were contemporaries in the Aliocene sea and the two lots 

 of F. pijnoii have their morphologic sequence the reverse of their 

 geologic order. Again, F. canaUculnlnm and F. pi/rnm arc contem- 

 jjoraries in the Recent seas and were probably even so in the Pliocene. 



To interpret such data in terms of the phylogeny, one must decide 

 between two quite diverse courses. In the first the worker may 

 accept the geologic sequence as indicating the phylogeny and modify 

 his ideas about organic evolution. The other cour.se lies in choosing 

 the morphologic sequence as portraying the phylogeny and intro- 

 ducing hypothetical species into the final scheme. In this latter 

 case forms which are morphologically discordant but geologically 

 intermediate must be regarded as intercalated migrants which havo 

 attained a high degree of specialization. 



As an illustration of the difficulties presented by the first method 

 of interpretation, attention is called to the Recent and Pliocene 

 examples of F. pyrum. Those from the Pliocene are according to 

 the morphology at the very limit of the sequence. If the Recent 

 Florida individuals of this species are derived from tlie Caloosahatchie 

 form, then the canal must have gone through a process the reverse 

 of acceleration, and the disappearance or non-appearance of a final 

 rounded stage must be accounted for in what is ])rol)abl}' a majority 

 of Recent examples. When the second method of interpretation is 

 applied to these two assemblages, it is found necessary to derive both 

 Recent and Plioccn(> exami^les from a hypothetical /•'. pyrum ancestor 

 less specializetl than the Pliocene form and not more specialized than 

 the Recent form here tabulated. On this basis the Caloosahatchie 

 F. pyrum is a terminal olTshot which is extinct and not the ancestor 

 of the less specialized Recent forms which are regarded as ]iost- 

 pliocene invaders from some other region. 



At first glance it would appear that the method of interpreting 

 by geologic jjo-iition alone presents fewer difficulties. The study of 

 these closely related sjjecies in this as well as in other grou))s of 

 gastropods has, however, led the author to favor not the first, but 

 the .second method of interpreting. The reasons for choosing such

a course will be more fully discussed later and at present it is suf- 

 ficient to say that the morphologic sequence displayed by F. corona- 

 turn, F. rugosum, F. canaliculaium, and the two assemblages of 

 F. pijrum is believed to be best interpreted in terms of the phylogeny 

 as follows:

writer has been able to learn, F. coronatum has not been found in 

 these earlier beds. Those favoring purely stratigraphic methods 

 will probably argue that, in anj^ phylogenetic scheme, F. coronatum 

 should be represented as derived from F. rugosum. This, however, 

 would require an explanation of the absence of a keeled stage in 

 F. coronatum and the acceptance of a theory that ontogenetic stages 

 do sometimes go through a process the reverse of acceleration. 

 The author inclines to the morphologic method in this case. It is 

 believed that the derivation of F. rugosum from F. coronatum or 

 something very close to it is amplj- justified, in spite of the fact that 

 the latter form has not yet been proved to extend farther back than 

 the St. jMary's Miocene. 



In passing it may be said that the F. pyrum-Wke forms from the 

 Duplin ^Miocene have been omitted purposely from the scheme, 

 because of the suspicion, as yet unverified, that most museum sets 

 are made up of specimens from more than one horizon in the Duplin 

 beds. 



The coeonatum-incile Sequence. 



The second morphologic sequence which commands our attention 

 starts, as before, with F. coronatum, but ends with the late Miocene 

 F. incile Conrad.'- Th(> gradations in this sequence, though not as 

 complete as in the F. coronalum-F. pyrum sequence, are perhaps no 

 less striking. Its members comprise F. coronatum Conrad (St. 

 Mary's Miocene), F. rngosunT Conrad (St. Mary's Miocene), F. 

 canaliculatum. (L.) (Pleistocene and Recent), and F. ■incile Conrad 

 (Burwell Bay Miocene). These are sho^vll in Table II. As before, 

 the sequence consists (1) in the progressively earlier appearance of 

 the canal in passing from F. coronatum to F. incile; (2) the progress- 

 ive shortening of the noded stage through compression of the strage 

 and acceleration of its later part; (3) the introduction and progressive 

 acceleration of the keeled stage and its final compression in the 

 terminal member, and (4) the introduction of a final rounded stage 

 in F. incile. 



In the succession of its ontogenetic stages, F. incile parallels /''. 

 pyrum, btit in other respects it is quite different. In F. pyrum the 

 tendency is for a shortening of the spire and a lengthening of the 

 anterior canal. For F. incile, on the other hand, the reverse is true; 



""Descriptions of Miocene Shells of tlie Atlantic Slope," T. A. Conrad, 

 Am. J. Conch., p. 64, pi. 0, fig. 2, 1868. 

 See also Am. J. Sci., vol. XXIII, p. 343. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 575 



the canal shortening and the spire becoming more .<calar during 

 individual gro\\i:h. Again the shell of F. pyrum tends to become 

 light and thin, that of F. incile thick and heavy with tlie progress 

 of the ontogeny. 



The secjuential relations presented by F. canalicidatum and F. 

 incile are by no means apparent unless one is dealing with well- 

 preserved specimens of the latter species. The average museum 

 specimen of F. incile fails completely in this respect. If, however, 

 the material is illustrative of the entire ontogeny, the similarity in 

 the immature stages of these two species is very striking, and e^'en 

 the late whorls and short anterior siphon of F. incile are occasionally 

 approached in very old and perhaps slightly abnormal individuals 

 of F. canalicidatum. 



When the geologic order of the.se species is considered in relation 

 to their morphologic sequence, we are confronted with the fact that 

 the Pleistocene and Recent (perhaps also Pliocene) F. canalicidatum 

 is morphologically intermediate between F. ruyosum of the St. ]Mary's 

 Miocene and F. incile of the Burwell Bay (James River) ^Miocene. 

 The descent of F. incile from any known race of F. canalicidatum is 

 manifestly impossible, but the derivation of F. canalicidatum from 

 F. incile could only be accomplished by the loss or non-development 

 of acquired characters and a resumption of primitive features only 

 slightly less marked than in F. rugosum. 



Again, a decision mast be made on what course to follow in inter- 

 preting the facts. We must either make the phylogeny agree with 

 the stratigraphic order and modify our conception of the laws of 

 evolution or else introduce a hypothetical common ancestor for 

 both F. canalicidatum and F. incile. On this basis F. incile would be 

 in no sense ancestral, but a terminal radiation of the late ^Miocene, 

 which left no descendants. 



In the case of the present sequence the author again favors the 

 second method of interpretation and believes that the fewer difficul- 

 ties are presented by the following phylogenetic schepie:

(d) Appearing in a very speciaUzed Pliocene form as early as the 

 middle of the third whorl (F. prjrum Caloosahatchie Race). 



(e) Though showing acceleration, its most notable changes are 

 due to exaggeration of its depth or of its width. 



(/) Its changes (variations or mutations) serve in part as a basis 

 for the species of systematists. Its persistence is of generic or 

 group value and serves to differentiate the canaliculate from the 

 non-canaliculate Fulgurs. 



The Noded Stage: 



(a) Oligocene to Recent in this group. 



(6) A declining character for this group, becoming weaker with 

 the progress of time. Accelerating more Ijv compression than by 

 the dropping out of nodes. 



(c) Appearing in all forms at about the beginning of whorl two. 

 Closing the ontogeny of primitive forms of the Miocene {F. corona- 

 turn). 



(d) Disappearing in very specialized forms before the completion 

 of the fourth whorl (F. pyritni). 



(e) Though its termination may show widely different degrees of 

 acceleration, its most notable changes are due to its degeneration. 



(/) Its changes through acceleration and degeneration serve in 

 part as a basis for the species of systematists. Its persistence is of 

 no higher classificatory value, for it is a primitive feature widely 

 distributed among very diverse groups of marine gastropods. 



The Keeled Stage: 



(a) Miocene to Recent in this group. 



(6) An ascendant character in the fairly primitive species (F. 

 rugosum, F. catudiculatum). A declining character in the most 

 specialized (F. pyrian, F. incile). 



(c) Appearing in more primitive forms toward the end of the 

 seventh whorl, in the most specialized toward the end of the fourth 

 whorl. 



(rf) Terminating tlic ontogeny in fairly prunitive forms (F. rugo- 

 sum, F. canaliculatum). Ending early in the si.xth whorl of the most 

 specialized (F. pyrum Caloosahatchie Pliocene). 



(e) Changes due to compression, acceleration; degeneration, and 

 exaggeration are all well marked. 



(/) Its changes through compression, acceleration, degeneration, 




578 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Oct., 



and exaggeration serve as a basis for the species of systematists. 

 It has no higlier classificatory value. 



The Final Rounded Stage: 



(a) Late Miocene to Recent in this group. 



(6) An ascendant character appearing only in the most specialized 

 species {F. pyrum, F. incile). Never a declining character, though it 

 may perhaps be indicative of decadence. 



(c) Never appearing in primitive forms. Appearing early in the 

 sixth whorl of the most specialized form {F. pyrum Caloosahatchie 

 Pliocene). Never, in this group, followed by any other ontogenetic 

 stage. 



(e) Its chief changes are due to its degree of exaggeration. 



(/) Its changes through exaggeration help to serve as a basis for 

 the species of systematists. It has no higher classificatory value.

NEW OR LITTLE-KNOWN CRAJJEFLIES FROM THE UNITED STATES AND 

 CANADA. TIPULID.S;. DIPTERA. 



BY CHARLES P. ALEXANDER. 



During the past few years the various collections of cranefiies in 

 the Eastern United States have been examined by the author and 

 observations made upon the more uncommon and less-known species^ 

 The following paper deals with the new species discovered, the 

 corrections in synonomy and the geographical distribution of insuf- 

 ficiently known forms. The collections examined are those of the 

 United States National Museum through the kindness of Mr. Knab, 

 The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia through Mr. 

 Cresson, the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge through 

 Mr. Henshaw, the Boston Society of Natural History through Mr. 

 Johnson and the private collections of Dr. W. G. Dietz, Mr. C. W. 

 Johnson, and Mr. M. C. Van Duzee. 



The Loew and Osten Sacken types are in the Museum of Com- 

 parative Zoology (excepting Triogma exculpta Osten Sacken, which 

 is in The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia). Cociuillett's 

 types and the Limnobinse described by Doane in his first paper are in 

 the National Museum. The species described by Mr. Johnson are in 

 The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Boston Society 

 of Natural History or in the private collection of the describer.

Related to R. midtiguttata Alexander (Guatemala) and in my key 

 to the species of this genus' it would run down to this form. It 

 differs widely in its wing-pattern which resembles that of certain 

 members of the suhpedinata group (atuudicornis Enderlein, schwarzi 

 Alexander) in the prominent rounded dark spots at the base of the 

 sector and at the stigma. The thoracic pattern, especially the 

 velvety black postnotum, separates this species off from any of the 

 described forms. 



This species is named in honor of INIr. Raj^nond C. Shannon, 

 assistant to ]\Ir. Knab in the Department of Dipterology at \\'ash- 

 ington, who collected the tj'pe and who has reared many interesting 

 cranefiies.

This curious fly was described from a single female taken at

 the generic reference as given above is more nearly correct. The 

 cross-vein r is shown in Dr. Lundbeck 's figure and it is indicated in 

 the material before me; it is probable that this species is an inter- 

 mediate form in the Eriopterine series. The following material was 

 .studied: One female, Signuia, BaflELn Land, Augu.st 2, 1897 (Schu- 

 'chert and White). Several of both sexes, Kokanee Mt., Brit. Col.,

I was unable to detect tibial spurs on this insect. The general 

 appearance is more like that of a Limnophila than any other form 

 known to me and I refer it to Gonoynyia with considerable doubt. 

 The long Sc and cross-vein r are not typical of Gonomyia. 



Genus CLADURA Osten Sackra. 

 18.59. Cladura Osten Sacken; Proc. Acad. Nat. Sei. Phila., p. 229. 

 Cladura delicatula sp. n. 



From the only described American species, C. flavo-ferruginea 0. S. 

 (= indivisa 0. S.), this form differs in its very much smaller .size and 

 pale coloration. The specimensoftnrfmsa mentioned by Osten Sacken,^ 

 where he states "some of the specimens, probably recently excluded, 

 were pale and without spots," may have belonged to this form. There 

 are no brown spots on the pleurae; the extreme lateral margin of the 

 abdominal tergites is dark; the wings are hyaline and lack the dark 

 markings on the cord, origin of the sector and on the outer deflection 

 of cell 1st Ml. I have compared this insect with the extensive 

 series of Cladura studied by Mr. Leonard and myself^ and have no 

 doubt of its .specific distinctness. The wing is figured in PI. XXVII, 

 fig. 27.

 wings uniting Rt^i with Mi. A second female was taken at Sugar 

 Grove, Fairfield Co., O., May 19, 1901, by Prof. J. S. Hine; the 

 female never having been described, I make this specimen the 

 allotype and characterize this sex as follows:

 orange-yellow, the caudal median portion lirown, smallest on segment 

 2, largest on segment 4; segments 5 to the end of the body brownish 

 yellow with a narrow darker median stripe; sternites yellow with a 

 narrow median brown stripe extending the length of the segment; 

 no black band on the middle of the fore femora.

 clearer gray on the vertex adjoining the eyes; first segment of the 

 antennte pale yellow, remainder of the antennse dark brown. 



Mesonotal prtescutmn light fawn-l)rown with an indistinct brownish 

 strips on either side of the middle line and shorter lateral pale brown 

 stripes, these latter continued caudad onto the lobes of the scutum; 

 scutellum grayish; postnotum light yellowish brown with a whitish 

 bloom. Pleurae light yellow. Halteres pale, the knob a little 

 darker. Leg.s yellow, coxae and trochanters brownish yellow, femora 

 yellow darkening into brown on the apical half or more, tibise and 

 tarsi dark brown. AVings light j-ellow, the veins yellow; small 

 brown markings as follows: a rounded spot on Sci continued up into 

 the costal cell; an oval spot at Sci; brown seams at tlie base of Rs, 

 base of R2+3, cross-vein r, tip of S2+3, fork of Ri+s,, cross-vein ?--m; 

 venation (PL XXV, fig. 7) : cell Rt much shorter than cell R3, usually 

 one-half as long; cell Mi very short usually about equal to its i^etiole 

 beyond cross-vein m or a little longer; cell Isl Ah very long, narrow; 

 Cui and M3 fused for a distance obliterating cross-vein m-cu. 



Abdominal tergites with the basal two-thirds brown, apical thirtl 

 yellowish; sternites dull brownish yellow, margined laterally with 

 brown, the apical segments with the margin reduced or lacking;

 brown tips to the femora narrower; abdomen usually with more 

 yellow color, often with a broad median patch of yellowish on the 

 tergites. 



In some of the males the scapal segments of the antennse are dark 

 brown, concolorous with the rest of the antennse. 



There is some variation in venation in the series, the fusion of 

 Mi and Citi is .sometimes lacking, the cross-vein m-cu being present 

 as in vernalis O.sten Sacken; one female lacks cross-vein m in both 

 wings.

 line Moore). 



The type and paratype No. 1 is in the collection of the l^niversity 

 of Toronto. 



This insect is closest to P. replicata Linnseus of Europe, but the 

 wings are darker colored, much more tinged with l)ro\\Ti; the vena- 

 tion, although similar in the persistence of the tip of Ri, shows a 

 tendency to the reduction of the radio-median cross-vein, the base 

 of cell Isf M; more arcuated and other details. Crunberg's figure 

 of the male In'popygium of irplicata'^^ shows differences in the shape 

 of the 9th tergite and the conspicuous appendages of the 9th sternite. 

 The wing venation of the three known species of the genus are figured 

 on PI. XXV, replicata, fig. 9, neoxena, fig. 10, tipulina, fig. 11. 



At this point it may be mentioned that there is a great difference 

 in the interpretation of the venation of the radial field of the wing 

 in this tribe of craneflies. ^lo.st authors have considered the 

 vein i?2 of the CylindrbtominiB to represent a combined fusion of 

 Ri+2+3 from the tip of the wing backward. From a study of the 

 venation of the known species of this tribe, about a dozen in all, 

 it is seen that the above interpretation of a long backward fusion 

 of Ri+-i*3 is impossible and two other possible explanations are here 

 presented. Looking over the series of wings before me, it seems 

 that the vein hitherto considered as Rn-i+a is, in reality, Ra or R,+, 

 alone, Ri becoming atrophietl beyond the radial cross-vein rather 

 than obliterating this cross-vein and fusing with R,. This is proved 

 by the wings of Phalacrocera shown in the plate, in replicata and 

 neoxena, R, being separated from R^+t, wherea-s in tipulina the tip of 

 Ri is atrophied beyond cross-vein r. A second possible interpretation 

 is that of considering the small cross-vein mentioned by Osten 

 Sacken as occurring in the costal cell beyond the tip of Sc and present 

 as a very indistinct vein in many specimens {Liogma) as being the 



'"Susswasserfauna Deutschland.*, vol. 2.\, pt. 1, p. ,33; 1910.

 about one-third way out; palpi brown. Pronotum brown, thorax 

 with lobes at base of \\ings dark; abdomen brownish; legs pale. 

 Wings yellowish hyaline, with pale venation; the forkings of veins, 

 co.stals at base, and some anal veins dark brown, the four gradates 

 dark and bordered with dark brown, the two i)ostcrior disjointed 

 from the two anterior bj^ more than their length; a large dark brown 

 spot in the subcostal area between subcosta and radius near base 

 of wings; behind it the cubital cros.s-vein is heavily dark, and the 

 median and radial cross-veins near base are also dark. The costal 

 area is quite broad, aliout four times as broad as the subcostal area. 

 In tiie hind wings the stigma at tip and .some of the outer forkings 

 are dark; the entire margin of both wings with dots between veins.

connected; the front tibise are plainly banded near base and at tip; 

 the head and thorax with pale median stripe ; the wings very heavily 

 marked with dark on plan of S. modestus, but the wings are about 

 one-fourth longer than in that species, making the cells more elon-

TRICHOPTERA. 



CEcetina pariehi n. sp. 



Yellowish, with yellow and gray hair; palpi densely gray-haired; 

 antennae with tips of joints plainly lilackish. Wings yellowash gray, 

 darker at tip, black along the outer margin, but here interrupted 

 three times with pale, a tuft of black hair on anal margin toward 

 base, surface with about ten black spots or marks; two near base, 

 one above the tuft on anal margin, one on fork of radial sector, two 

 or three at anastomosis, one beyond, one at end of radius, one at end 

 of subcosta and one near arculus. Hind wings with gray fringe, 

 much longer than width of the wings. In fore wings the discal cell 

 is nearly as long as its pedicel, strongly convex above, fork 1 twice 

 as long as its pedicel ; both wings acute at tips. Expanse 12 mm.

 Macronema fragilis n. sp. 



Face yellowish, with whitish hair; antennse pale, faintly marked 

 at tips of the joints; vertex brown; thoracic notum brown, abdomen 

 pale on base, dark at tip; legs pale yellowish, hind tarsi darker; 

 fore wings a nearly uniform brown, veins darker, an elongate pale 

 spot over stigmal area, broader on basal part, reaching to discal cell, 

 apical part usually containing a dark spot, beyond this and half 

 way to tip is a ydlowish white spot extending from costa to fork 2, 

 in base of second apical cell, just beyond discal cell, is a pale spot; 

 hind wings gray, fringe black. In structure extremely similar to 

 M. parvum, and venation practically the same. Expanse 14 mm.

Macronema picteli n. sp. PI. XXVIII, fig. 9. 



Similar to M. lineatum and M. argentilineatuni, and probably the 

 species referred to by Ulmer (Selys, Trich. pt. 2, p. 09) under M. 

 argentilineatum from British Guiana in Leyden Museum. It differs 

 from M. lineatum in small eyes, and longer, more pointed wings, 

 and the apical marks are a little different. It differs from M. argen- 

 tilineatinn, in having fork 1 to hind wings, and in the position of the

costal cross-vein in fore wings, and the apical marks of fore wings. 

 The wings are long, dark brown; there is a transverse band of white 

 in stigmal region, a crescentic white mark over tip of wing, and pale 

 spots on outer margin in the cells. Between the apical and stigmal 

 marks is a large patch of golden hair, which when rubbed shows 

 hyaline streaks in the bases of several apical cells. Expanse 26 mm. 



From Mallali, British Guiana, March (Parish). 

 Phylloicus brevior n. sp. PI. XXVIII, figs. 2. 4. 



Body j-ellowish, with yellow hairs; anterior part of the thorax 

 blackish, and tip of abdomen dark; antennae black-haired, and 

 sometimes a black spot over base of each antenna; a row of black 

 hairs each side of face under the antenn-ae; legs pale, most of fore 

 and mid tarsi, all of hind tarsi and part of tibia black, three spurs 

 on hind tibia, four on mid tibia. Wings nearly evenly dark reddish 

 brown, darker on costal area and on apex; hind wings also dark, 

 more blackish. Fore wings with venation much like that of P. 

 abdominaUs — that is, the first fork extends one-half waj- back on 

 discal cell; in the hind wings, however, the apical forks are longer, 

 and there is no closed median cell; the male genitalia are exposed.

MIOCENE FOSSIL INSECTS. 

 BY T. D. A. COCKERELL. 



The miocene insect beds at Florissant, Colorado, continue to 

 furnish numerous undescribed species, and the time is still distant 

 when it will be approjiriate to bring all the data together in a single 

 monograph. To illustrate the wonderful richness of the Florissant 

 shales, it is sufficient to mention Professor H. F. Wickham's collection 

 made in 1912 at the Wilson Ranch. In an excavation about 20 feet 

 long and 6 feet deep he obtained over 90 species of Coleoptera, of 

 which at least 40 were new. In addition to this. Professor Wickham, 

 my wife, and I secured various species of other groups in this same 

 excavation, so that probably there will be in all not less than ()0 new 

 species. This particular spot had been looked over several times in 

 previous years by University of Colorado expeditions, ijut had 

 yielded nothing of particular value, because only the surface was 

 examined. On digging into the hill, the remarkable collection just 

 mentioned was secured. There can be no doubt that the Florissant 

 shales are practically inexhaustible; but it is unforUmately true that 

 many good fossils, some doubtless of species which will never be 

 found again, have been collected and lost or placed where they are 

 unlikely to fall into the hands of comiJctcMit students. Even in the 

 larger museums there are still many undescribed Florissant species, 

 and it will be some years liefore we have a complete account of the 

 materials already gathered and in safe custody. 



In Europe, the locality which we naturally cuiuijan' witii Florissant 

 is ffiningcn in Baden. The beds, which I have cxaniincd so far as 

 their jireseiit condition permits, are not, strictly speaking. !it (ICningen, 

 but above the village of Wangen, on the Rhine. They are doubtless 

 extensive, and would yield nuich of value if reexcavat(>d, but they 

 have been neglected for many years. \'arious Eurojjeau nmseums 

 contain ffiningen insects, but by far the rirhest collection is that of 

 Heer at Ziirich. Ileer estimated that he knew 844 species of fossil 

 insects from GCningen, but only 4(j4 ever receiveti published seientific 

 names. Of these no less than 250 were Coleoptera, but Professor 

 Wickham records 404 described beetles from Florissant. Eighty 




191-i-] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 635 



Heniiptera are from (Eningfni, but Florissant has about 230. The 

 Hymenoptera from (Eningen number 60, but those of Florissant 

 are about 220, with only one of the many ants as yet published. 

 Thirty Diptera come from CEningen, over 100 from Florissant. 

 CEningen has only one recorded Trichopteron, Florissant 29. The 

 (Eningen list could be consideraljly increased if we added a nunaber 

 of species cited by their generic names or even less exactly, but not 

 described or given specific names. Experience shows that such 

 records are too unreliable to be of much value. (Eningen has more 

 species than Florissant in each of the following groups, as the lists 

 stand at present. (0. = (Eningen; F. = Florissant.) 



Odonata— Libellulidte: 0. 9, F. none. However, the (Eningen 

 species are simply a lot of nymphs;' one, L. perse, is doubtfully from 

 CEningen. Specunens of L. eurynome and L. doris are in the Univer- 

 sity of Colorado Museum. 



Thysanoptera— Thripidie: O. 2, F. none. 



Orthoptera— Gryllotalpinse: 0. l,F.none. The CEningen species 

 is stated to be long and narrow, but we have no other details. 



CoLEOPTERA—Carabidse: O. 35, F. 33. Dytiscida: 0. 9, F. 8. 

 Gyrinida;: 0. 2, F. none. Scaphidiids: O. 2, F. none. Histeridte: 

 0. 9, F. none. Elaterida;: O. 10, F. 4 (but many more Florissant 

 species await description). Buprestids: O. 31, F. 15. Hydrophilids: 

 O. 17, F. 8. Trogositidae: 0. 7, F. 1. Coccinellida?: 0. 7, F. 3. 

 Scarabseidie: O. 34, F. 28. Florissant especially outranks CEningen 

 in Curculionidae (O. 24, F. 95) and Staphylinida? (O. 7, F. 45). The 

 most striking feature is the absence of Histerida; at Florissant. It 

 is curious that the lists contain no Cicindelida;. 



Hymenoptera— Cephida;: 0. 2, F. 1. Sphecida;: O. 4, F. 2. 

 CEningen has 34 described species of ants, Florissant only one, but 

 very numerous ants from the latter place await description bv 

 Dr. Wheeler. 



Lepidoptera — Psychidse: O. 1 (a case), F. none. 

 Diptera— Bibionidie: 0. 14, F. 4. ChinonomidEe : O. 3, F. none 

 good enough to describe. Tachinida;: O. 1, F. none. 



Hemiptera— Reduviidse: O. 11, F. 3. Naucorida;: O. 2, F. none. 

 Belostomatida?: 0. 2, F. 1. Nepidaj; 0. 1, F. none. 



This enumeration is of interest mainly as a statement of the present 

 condition of our knowledge, but some of the features indicated 

 probably will be confirmed or amplified by fuller data. 



The new species described below have, with few exceptions, been 

 collected by Professor Wickham.

636 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



ORTHOPTERA. 



Amblycorypha (1) perdita n. sp. (Locustidaj). 



Tegmen 30.5 mm. long, 12 mm. broad, the broadest part about 

 11 mm. from the very broadly rounded and obtuse apex; costal 

 region not enlarged, the subcostal nervure about equally distant 



from costa and stem of 

 radius until 5 or 6 mm. 

 from base, where it is nearer 

 costa than radius, and so 

 continues; radius straight, 

 the radial sector coming off 

 at a rather wide angle near 

 Amblycorypha {?) perdita. the middle of the tegmen; 



apical field irregularh' retic- 

 ulated throughout. The lower margin of the tegmen can be dis- 

 tinctly followed to nea,r the base, and there appears to be no anal 

 lobe, but it seems exceedingly probable that this is illusory, the 

 apparent margin near the base being the sharp line of demarcation 

 found in the modern species, limiting the anal area above. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch {Wickh(wi). I have 

 wondered whether this could be Scudder's Orchelinntm plncidum, 

 but it is certainly not an Orchelimum, and beyond a general similaritj^ 

 there is nothing definite to indicate its identity with Scudder's species. 

 It is provisionally placed in Amblycorypha, to which it is jjresumably 

 allied, and from which, without better "preserved materials, it does 

 not seem worth while to separate it. Mr. J. A. G. Rchn kindly 

 examined my sketch of the venation, and reported that it was not 

 quite like any modern genus; as he observed, if the anal area is truly 

 absent, the tegmen is quite peculiar; but if it is present, the insect 

 is not very remarkable. Except for the shape of the tegmen, there 

 is a rather close resemblance in structure to Pycnophlehia speciosa 

 (Gcrmar) from the lithographic stone of Solenhofen. 



HEMIPTERA. 



PSYLLITES n. gen. (Psyllidffi). 



The distinctive characters are in the venation, a.s follows: 



(1) The radius leaves the radial sector a little before the middle 

 of the wing, and passes obliquely to the costa, where it ends, as in 

 Psylla asligmata. 



(2) The stem of the radius is in a straight line vnth the radial 




1914.1 



NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



637 



sector, which is nearly straight, with only a slight curvature, prac- 

 tically as in Psylla caudata. 



(3) The mediocubital fork is some distance basad of the separation 

 of the radius from its sector, as in Psylla. 



(4) The separation of the radius from the radial sector is at prac- 

 tically the same level as the separation of the branches of the cubitus, 

 the cell between the cubital branches being long, the arrangement 

 herein practically as in Pachypsylla venusta. The cell in the forks 

 of the media is, however, as in Psylla. 



Except for the shape of the cell in the forks of the cubitus, the 

 insect could go in Psylla; herein it is less specialized than Psylla. 

 The outline of the wing, as figured, is only approximate. 

 Psyllites crawfordi n. sp. 



Length about 2 mm., anterior wng less than 1.5 mm.; wings clear, 

 without markings. The following measurements are in microns: 

 length of upper wing, about 

 1,440; radial fork to base of 

 wing, about 690 ; radial fork to 

 end of radial sector, about 

 752; medio-cubital fork to 

 branching of cubitus, 224; 

 medio-cubital fork to branch- 

 ing of media, 624; cell between 

 cubital ):)ranches on wing-mar- 

 gin, 320; fork of media to level of radial and cubital forks, about 416; 

 fork of media to nearest point on anterior branch of cubitus, 208. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch {Wickham). On the 

 same piece of shale as the type of Heteromyiella miocenica and very 

 close to it. Dedicated to Mr. David L. Crawford, whose monograph 

 of the Psyllidffi of the New World has been of great use in the study 

 of the fossil species. 



HYMENOPTERA. 



PAL^OTELEIA n. gen. (SceUonidse). 



Elongate, ^vith the same form as Chromoteleia semicyanea Ashmead, 

 except that the abdomen is broader, fully twice as broad at base, 

 broadest about the end of the second segment, and Math the apical 

 1 mm. or more conspicuously narrower than the part before. An- 

 tennae iaserted very close to the middle (vertical) line of face, perhaps 

 on a frontal prominence; scape apparently short; flagellum rather 

 long and of uniform width, not at all moniliform. Head broad. 



Psylliles crawfordi, wing. 




638 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DcC, 



eyes prominent. Thorax long and narrow, the parts indistinct, but 

 there is a cordiform metatlioracic area or depression, and just in front 

 of this a transverse series of little ridges or pleats, presumably on the 

 postscutellum (compare Macroteleia) . Hind femora unusually stout. 

 Wings with a very well developed submarginal vein, but no marginal 

 at all; stigmal vein short but distinct, ending in a round knob; 

 postmarginal vein long; a shadowy oblique vein going from the 

 postmarginal toward the stigmal knob, as in Chromoteleia. 



Palaeoteleia oxyura n. sp. 



Length nearlj- 7 mm.; anterior wing nearlj' 4 mm.-, the stigmatal 

 knob 2.25 from base. Elongate, narrow, black, antennae and legs 

 ferruginous; thora.x narrow, about .75 mm. in length anterior to 

 wings; abdomen narrow and tapering, sessile, rather broad at base, 

 its length a little over 4.5 nmi., its width a very little over 1 mm.; 

 thorax same width as abdomen. A\'ings ample, clear, faintly reddish, 

 with a small ferruginous cloud in stigmatal region. 



The following measurements are in microns: length of post- 

 marginal vein, about 640; length of stigmal vein, including knob, 

 256, without knob, 192; diameter of fiagellum, 128; width of hind 

 femur, 352; length of hind tibia, about 1,120. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch (Wickham). 



This is fully as specialized as the modern genera. 



Polistes kirbyanus n sp. 



Osmia kirbyaria Hoer Mii. 

 Stout bodied, with rather short abdomen, the basal two segments 

 of which are pallid and the other parts dark brown. Wings ample, 

 dusky. Length of body 13 mm., of wings about 11 mm.; first 

 discoidal cell almost 5.5 mm. long. Most of the venation of the 

 anterior wing's can be made out, showing that it is nearly normal for 

 Policies, except that the first t.c, instead of being straiglit, has a 

 double curve like the second. The third s.m. is much broader above 

 than the second. As in Polistes, the b.n. goes basad of t.m.; the 

 second s.m. receives both recurrent nervuros (the cell is very broad, 

 broader than in modern Polistes); the fir.st discoidal cell is very 

 oblique at end; the marginal cell has an elongated triangular form. 

 The great width of the second s.m. and the long very oblique ajjical 

 end of the first discoidal agree better with Monobia {M. qitadridens L., 

 Rito de los Friioles, New Mexico, 11'. W. Robbins; det. Rohwer) 

 than with Polistes. On the other hand, the third s.m. agrees with 

 Polistes, not with Monobia. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 639 



Miocene of Wangen, Baden; described from Heer's type specimen 

 in the University Museum at Ziiricli. Heer named a Polistes prinii- 

 iiva from ffiningen (Wangen), but as no description appeared, it 

 cannot be recognized. 



It may be useful to add that Heer's Vespa atavina from Moudon 

 is not the same species as his much earlier Vespa attavina from 

 Parschlug; Handlirsch treats them as identical, spelling the name 

 atavina. 



Odynerus percontusus n. sp. 



Length about 8 mm.; black, including legs; wings hyaline, the 

 nervures pallid, darker liasally; length of anterior wing about 5 mm.,, 

 reaching at least to end of thnd abdominal segment; head and thorax 

 strongly but irregularly punctured; abdomen very broad at base, 

 second segment large, about 1.65 mm. long and 2.40 broad; apex of 

 stigma broad and obtuse, only moderatelj' oblique; end of marginal 

 cell squarely (not obliquely) truncate; second s.m. not narrowed to 

 a point above. 



The following measurements are in microns: basal nervure on first 

 discoidal, 1,472; first submarginal (s.m.) on first discoidal, 928; 

 first s.m. on marginal, 528; second s.m. on marginal, 128; third s.m. 

 on marginal, 368; wdth of truncate end of marginal, about 128; 

 second s.m. on first discoidal, 192; distance between ends of recurrent 

 nervures on second s.m., 272; end of second r.n. to lower end of 

 second t.c, 80; lower side of third s.m., 448. 



The general structure is essentially as in the living 0. tuberculo- 

 cephalus Sauss. (Boulder, Colo., W. P. Cockerell; det. Rohwer); 

 but the abdomen is more as in 0. capra Sauss. (Colorado Springs, 

 Colo., T. and W. Cockerell, at flowers of Ribes aureum; det. Rohwer). 

 The measurements readily distinguish this from the other species 

 fossil at Florissant. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch (Wickham). 



Odynerus wilmattse n. sp. (Eumenidje). 



Black, apparently vnth light bands on abdomen; length of head 

 and thorax 3 mm., of abdomen about 4.5 mm. in bent position, but 

 would be about 6.5 straightened out, of anterior A\'ings 4.5 mm.; 

 first abdominal segment rather small, in lateral profile only about 

 1 mm. deep, whereas the abdomen in middle is fully 2 mm.; wings 

 dusky reddish, venation ordinary, marginal cell very narrowly 

 obliquely truncate at end; third t.c. arched inward; second s.m. 

 greatly narrowed above, receiving first r.n. a little before middle 




640 PHOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



and second very near end (very much nearer end than in the living 

 0. tuberculiceps, 0. capra and 0. parietum); second r.n. at right angles 

 to lower side of third s.m. 



The following measurements are in microns: second s.m. on mar- 

 ginal cell, 64; third s.m. on marginal, 256; lower side of marginal 

 beyond tliird s.m., 384; lower side of third s.m., 384; end of first 

 r.n. to end of second, 176. 



Station 14, Miocene shales of Florissant {Wiltnatte P. Cockerell). 

 Very easily known from other fossil (as well as living) species by the 

 remarkably short wings. It has also been examined bj' i\Ir. S. A. 

 Rohwer, who cannot find any reason for regarding it as a distinct 

 genus, notwithstanding its peculiar appearance. The anterior wings 

 reach only a little beyond end of second abdominal segment. The 

 wings, as preserved, are not longitudinallj' folded. 



Falseovespa wilsoni n. sp. (Vespidse). 



9. Lengih about 15 mm., anterior wing about or hardh^ 9 mm., 

 first discoidal cell 4 mm.; robust, head and thorax black, abdomen 

 paler, probably yellow in life, as also the legs; wings clear, veins 

 nearly colorless (costo-apical region lost); first discoidal cell slightly 

 oblique at end; second recurrent neiwure ending more than twice 

 as far from first as from end of second s.m. 



The following measurements are in microns: basal nervure on 

 first discoidal cell, 2,550; first discoidal on first submarginal cell, 

 1,760; first discoidal on second submarginal, 144; third discoidal on 

 second submarginal, 48Q; lowcp- side of second s.m. beyond third 

 discoidal; 192; lower side of third discoidal 1,840; lower side of third 

 submarginal, 640; tliird discoidal on second discoidal, 512; outer 

 side of second discoidal below third discoidal, 288. 



Wilson Ranch, Miocene shales of Florissant (//. F. M'ickhairi). 

 Named after the owner of the ranch where the fossils were collected, 

 who did everything in his power to aid the work. Nearest to P. 

 gillettei Ckll., but differing in the venation too much to be regarded 

 as a variation. 



Andrena percontusa n. sp. (.Andrcnids). 



9 . Length 12 mm., anterior wing about 8 mm.; head and thorax 

 black, abdomen pale; antenna; ferruginous; wings clear, venation 

 ferruginous; basal nervure falling short of the very oblique traus- 

 versomedial; stigma large; first r.n. joining second s.m. near end. 



The following measurements are in microns: depth of stigma, 320; 

 first s.m. on basal nervure, 368; lower side of first s.m., 1,040; second 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 641 



s.m. on first discoidal cell, 480; second s.m. on third discoidal, 64; 

 lower side of third s.m., about 800; distance between lower end of 

 l).n. and upper end of t.m., 64. 



Wilson Ranch, Miocene shales of Florissant {H. F. Wickham). 

 Apparently a quite typical Andrena. It is easily known from A. 

 grandipes Ckll. and A. hypolitha Ckll. by the venation. The venation 

 is like that of -4. sepidta Ckll. and A. davula Ckll., but these are much 

 smaller species, and davula is also separated by the form of the 

 al)domen. 



Cladius petrinus n- sp. (TenthredinidEe). 



9 . Length 7.5 mm., robust; antennae 3.65 mm. long, simple, 

 rather slender; width of head 1.85 mm.; head and posterior half of 

 thorax apparently black, rest of thorax and abdomen probably 

 retldish in life ; wings clear, with very pale nervures ; 4.25 mm. from 

 base of wing to middle of stigma. The end of the best wing is lost, 

 so that it is impossible to determine from it whether the marginal cell 

 has a cross-vein. The other wing is over the body and it is hard to 

 see the details, but the marginal nervure is sufficiently plain, and I 

 am confident that there is no cross-nervure. This accords with 

 Cladius, with which the rest of the wing closely agrees. The insect 

 runs in Rohwer's table {Bull. Amer. Mas. N. Hist., XXIV, p. 521) to 

 20, and runs out on account of the character of the lanceolate cell. 

 If it had a marginal cross-nervure, it would run to Hemichroa eophila 

 Ckll., which is larger and otherwise different. There is no particular 

 resemblance to any more recently described species. Compared with 

 MacGillivray's figure of Cladius pedinicornis, the anterior wing 

 differs as follows: first s.m. longer; second t.c. bowed inward; t.m. 

 much beyond middle of second part of lanceolate cell; end of second 

 r.n. only a very short distance beyond second t.c. It agrees in the 

 sides of the first discoidal cell being not at all parallel, the long and 

 narrow second discoidal, the very short upper side of first discoidal, 

 etc. The separation of the two parts of the lanceolate cell by a single 

 (coalesced) nervure is very short indeed, only 128 microns. 



The following measurements are in microns: length of first sub- 

 marginal cell (s.m.), 240; second s.m. on marginal, 928; first discoidal 

 on first s.m., 288 (the thickness of the nervures explains the difference 

 from the inside measurement of first s.m.); second s.m. on first 

 discoidal, 432; second s.m. on third discoidal (not allowing for the 

 strong curve), 1,040; third s.m. on third discoidal, 96; third s.m. 

 from second r.n. to end (apparently, from the oliscurely preserved 

 wing), 656; first discoidal on basal nervure, 1,200; lower end of basal

 of t.m., 480; submedian cell on secoiid part (beyond the interruption) 

 of lanceolate cell, 1,280; second discoidal on lanceolate (anal) cell, 

 768; lower side of second discoidal beyond lanceolate cell, 400.

Eriooampa celata n. sp. (TenthredinidEe). 



Length 8 mm., abdomen 4, anterior wing G mm.: ferruginou.^, with 

 the head, posterior half of thorax and apex of abdomen apparently 

 black; legs ferruginous; anterior wings reddish hyaline, nervures 

 pallid; antenna? ordinary, not clavate, width at about 1,600 microns 

 from base 208 microns; insect, as preserved, so like Cladius petrinus 

 that I assumed it to be the same until I examined the venation. The 

 venation appears to agree well with Eriocanipa. In Rohwer's table 

 the insect does not agree with Eriocanipa because the first r.n. is not 

 parallel with the b.n., the upper end of the r.n. being about 208 

 microns too far apicad; but nearly the same thing is true of E. ovala, 

 as figured by MacGillivraj^ (NortoneUa has the same feature, but is 

 otherwise quite different). Characteristic features of E. celala are 

 the oblique, gentlj' arched cross-vein of marginal cell, whicli joins 

 the stigma 208 microns below tlie costa; the produced lower apical 

 comer of first s.m. ; the two sides of first discoidal cell (on basal and 

 rcciu'rent nervures) nearly equal; the second s.m. receiving only 

 one r.n.; the very narrow (112 microns) top of first discoidal cell. 

 The lanceolate cell is contractedT but not closed; the cross-nervure, 

 which ought to be present, is obliterated, l)ut I think I can see the 

 stump of the upper end (this, however, is not positive). 



The following measurements are in microns: first s.m. on marginal, 

 288; secontl s.m. on uiarginal (not allowing for curve), 800; end of .second 

 t.c. to lower end of marginal cross-vein, 608; lower end of marginal 

 cro.ss-vein to upper end of third t.c, 368; first s.m. diagonally, 448; 

 first discoidal on first s.m., 480; first discoidal on second s.m., 416; 

 basal on first discoidal, 832; first discoidal on third, 800; lower end 

 of b.n. to upper end of t.m., 288 on one side, but 208 on opposite wing; 

 upper end of t.m. to lower end of first r.n., 512. Known from the 

 Florissant species of Eriocampa by the colors and the venation — 

 e.g., from E. synlhelica, pristina and wheeleri by the measurements 

 of the first discoidal cell ; from scudderi and brucn by the compara- 

 tive measurements of the first two submarginals.

DIPTERA. 



Protolomatia antiqua Cockerell (Bombyliidae). 



The reverse of the tjT^e has been found and shows some of the 

 details of the venation better than the original specimen. It shows, 

 in particular, that the upper basal corner of second submarginal cell 

 has a short accessory nervure pointing directh' basad; consequently, 

 in my table in Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXXIII, p. 233, the genus 

 runs straight to Alepidophora. The insect is, however, very distinct 

 from Alepidophora pealei in a variety of ways, such as the more 

 widely open first posterior cell, the quite different shape of the second 

 posterior, and the shape of the end of the marginal cell. The end 

 of the marginal cell in A. pealei is like that of Paracosmus morrisoni, 

 whereas in P. antiqua it is as in Paracosmus insolens. In the original 

 account of ^4. pealei, it appears that the praefurca is practically obso- 

 lete, but a new study of the type shows that this is an error of inter- 

 pretation, owing to the condition of preservation; the praefurca is 

 actually 880 microns long in A. pealei, while the first basal cell on 

 the first submarginal is 2,240 microns. 



In the reverse of P. antiqua the abdomen appears reddish, con- 

 spicuously lighter than the thorax; it is not banded like that of 

 .4. pealei. 



A new and much more complete set of measurements (in microns) 

 of P. antiqua is offered. Length of praefurca, 592; width (depth) 

 of marginal cell near end, 480; first submarginal on wang margin 

 (not allowing for curve), 850; squared basal end of second submargi- 

 nal, 272; second submarginal on first posterior, 1,184; first basal 

 on first submarginal, 1,472; first posterior on first submarginal, 

 1,280; length of anterior cross- vein, 288; discal cell on first basal, 

 1,360; discal on first posterior, 608; width (depth) of discal cell at 

 level of anterior cross-vein, 304; discal cell on second basal, 224; 

 first posterior on wing-margin, 304; second posterior on discal, 280; 

 second posterior on wing-margin, 800; second posterior on third, 

 992; third posterior on ^-ing-margin, 720; fourth posterior on second 

 basal, 128; greatest width of anal cell, 352; anal on wing-margin, 

 400. 

 Geron (1) platysoma n. sp. (BombylUda). 



Length about 10.5 mm.; thorax about 3 mm., the dorsum in 

 lateral profile flat for about 2 mm. ; length of wing, 7.5 mm. ; abdomen 

 with dorsal region alternately banded dark and light, the dark twice 

 as broad as the light (as Becker figures for Heterotropus glaucus). 




64i PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



Wings clear, with light ferruginous nervures; venation as in Geron 

 gibbosus, with anal cell closed well before wing-margin, but the 

 discal cell is produced apically above and the anterior cross-vein is 

 oblique; all the venational characters agree exactly with a Geron 

 from Colorado. 



The following measurements are in microns: first submarginal 

 cell on wino; margin, 608; length of praefurca, 400; first submarginal 

 cell on first posterior, 1,664; first submarginal on first basal, 1,456; 

 second submarginal on first posterior, about 1,920; first basal on 

 discal, 1,184; first posterior on discal, 960; lower side of discal cell 

 (on third posterior), 1,392; discal on second basal, 192; third pos- 

 terior on second basal, 288. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch (Wickhnni). The 

 venation absolutely agrees with that of certain species of Geron, but 

 the long, flattened thorax (perhaps partlj'' distorted by pressure?) 

 is very unlike that genus. The antennsE and proboscis cannot be 

 made out. I suppose that the ancestors of Geron got the venation 

 of the modern flies before they got the abbreviated form and humped 

 thorax. The fossil should probably constitute a distinct genus, 

 but it may provisionally remain in Geron, pending the discovery of 

 better preserved material. 

 Heteromyiella miocenica n, sp. (Holomyzidse). 



Length 5 mm., wing 4.5 mm.; head, thorax and legs black; abdo- 

 men reddish, with scattered coarse bristles; wings reddish hyaline, 

 without markings. Oral vibrissae'very large; anterior (or middle?) 



tibia with straight spur and curved jireapical 

 bristle. Venation normal ; costa with many 

 very short black l)ristlcs ([practically as in 

 Heteromyiella senilis = Heteromyza senilis 

 Scudder), but no long ones; auxiliary vein 

 Ueteromyirw, ^m^rrnuca. ^Ustinct, Complete and Separate: anterior 



cross-vein below end of first vein; first 

 posterior cell broadened in middle, the third vein distinctly arched 

 upward (as in Ileloini/za limbata);. second basal cell minute but 

 distinct, anal cell also distinct. 



The following measurements arc in microns: humeral cross-vein 

 to end of first vein, 1,520; end of auxiliary vein to end of first vein, 

 400; second vein from point below end of first vein to wing-margin, 

 1,920; suljmarginal cell on wing margin (not allowing for curve), 

 592; submarginal cell on first posterior, 2,080; width of first pos- 

 terior cell at level of end of discal, 448; fir.st posterior on discal, 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 64:5 



800; first posterior on second posterior, 1,120; discal cell on second 

 posterior, 544; second posterior on third posterior, 320; first basal 

 on discal, 1,250; second basal on discal, 112; anal on third posterior, 

 208. 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch (Wickhain). It is 

 rather remarkable that the Heteromyiella type, with only short 

 brisi,. s on the costa, should apparently (as shown by fossils from two 

 or three localities) have Ijeen prevalent in North America in Tertiarj" 

 times, whereas in the modern fauna it has given way to the genera 

 with long as well as short bristles. 



Empis miocenica n. sp. (EmpididiE). 



Length 5.5 mm., wing a little over 5.5, middle leg about 5; head 

 about 1 mm. long, beak evident, but its length cannot be ascertained. 

 Whole insect, as preserved, light ferruginous, the abdomen with 

 dusky bands; wings reddish, mth a very dilute stigmatal cloud. 

 Only the upper part of the wing shows the venation clearly, but this 

 appears to be quite normal for the genus. 



The following measurements are in microns : end of first vein from 

 base of wing, about 3,440; end of first vein to second (vertically) at 

 same level, 144; end of first vein to end of second, about 1,600; 

 separation of second and third veins from base of wing, about 1,120; 

 the two branches of third vein are about equally long (1,120), the 

 upper branch almost .straight, ^vith a very faint dowTiward curve. 

 The auxiliary vein can be seen very close to the first, but extremely 

 weak and not reaching costa. The hind femora are large and stout, 

 with a row of short, stiff, black spiniform bristles on the lower side. 

 The anterior legs are lost. 



Wilson Ranch, ^Miocene shales of Florissant {H. F. Wickham). 

 Coasiderably larger and more robust than E. florissantana, with the 

 head much smaller in proportion to the thorax. 



Empis florissantana n. sp. (Empididse). 



9 . Length about 4.50 mm.; wings 3.25, hyaline, except for a brown 

 stigmatic cloud; middle legs about 4 mm. Face not hairy; head in 

 lateral profile broad-oval; proboscis stout and stiff, much longer 

 than head; thoracic dorsum dark; venation orthnary; hind femur 

 reaching end of fifth abdominal segment. 



The following measurements are in microns: length of head, about 

 640; length of proboscis, about 1,040; anterior femur, about 1,040, 

 its tibia about the same; end of second vein to end of anterior branch 

 of third, 272; length of anterior branch of third, 320; length of

posterior or inferior branch of third, G72; apical width of first posterior 

 cell, about 336; apical width of second posterior, about 320. 



Wilson Ranch, Miocene shales of Florissant {H. F. Wickham). 

 This appears to be a quite ordinary species of Empis. These are the 

 first Empididae to be described from Florissant. 



Empis florisnantann. Costo-apical region of wing. 



Empis florissanlana. Discal cell ami udjacenl parts. 

 Flecia axeliana n. sp. (Bibionidse). 



9. Length about 8.5 Inm., wing 9 mm.; thorax black with the 

 mesothorax apparently red; abdomen banded dark and light, the 

 light bands ^\^de^ than the dark; wings reddish hyaline, suffuscdly 

 darker in costal region; head small, al>out 1.2') mm. diameter; 

 venation normal. 



The following measurements arc in microns: dcjith of marginal 

 cell at level of anterior cross-vein, 480; depth of submarginal cell at 

 level of end of second vein (so-called anterior branch of third), 480; 

 distance from end of second vein to end of third, about 1,760; dis- 

 tance in a straight line from base 'of marginal coll to separation of 

 second vein from third, 2,880; length of the rather oblique anterior 

 cross-vein, 272; lower end of anterior cross-vein to fork of fourth, 

 752. 



Wilson Ranch, Miocene shales of Florissant (//. /■'. Wickham). 

 Much larger than P. melanderi Ckll. (cf), with the abdomen quite 

 differently marked; but in view of the sexual dimorphLsm in this 

 family, it may be the female of melanderi. I have given it a name 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 647 



derived from Professor Melander's given name, to serve as an indica- 

 tion of tliis probability. It seems inadvisable to assume identity, 

 as it is improbable that it can be proved, and since the insects appear 

 different, it is desirable to know which is referred to in any particular 

 citation. When describing P. melanderi I remarked on the lengthen- 

 ing of the stem of the fourth vein, between the anterior cross-vein 

 and the fork. In P. plagiala Wied. (det. Knab) from Quirigua, 

 Guatemala (IF. P. Cockerell), it is exactly as long (752 microns) as 

 in P. axeliana. P. plagiata, however, differs radically from P. axeliana 

 and melanderi in having the second vein (or upper branch of third) 

 directed vertically upward, so that it looks like a cross-vein. 



Bibio wickhami n. sp. (Bibionidae). 



9. Length about 12 mm.; wing 6.75; proboscis 2 mm.; hind 

 femur 3 mm.; second posterior cell slightly over 2.5 mm! long. 

 Head, thorax and legs black; abdomen dark broT\Ti, the sutures 

 colorless; wings clear, the costal region slightly bro^^Tiish, veins pale 

 reddish. The stem of third vein, before the cross-vein (following the 

 usual interpretation), is 576 microns long, while the cross-vein is only 

 about 80. The cross-vein leaves the fourth at a slight angle, and is 

 in a straight line with the part of the third (2 + 3) beyond it, the 

 third being abruptly bent at the cross-vein. This is nearly as in the 

 living Bihio alhipennis, Ijut is very different from the Florissant fossil 

 B. atnvus, in which the stem of fourth before the cross-vein is only 

 about 320 microns, while the oblique cross-vein is about 1,040, Ijeing 

 almost as long as the stem of fourth vein between the cross-vein and 

 the fork (basal corner of second posterior cell). 



Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch (Wickham). 



Mycomya lithomendax n. sp. (MycetophilidiE). 



Length nearly 5.5 mm., abdomen 4, wing 4 mm.; anterior tibia 

 about 1.5 mm., its tarsus 2.5; microscopical measurements give the 

 following in microns: anterior tibia, 1,392; its basitarsus, 1,120; 

 length of antenna, 1,920. Dorsum of thorax and abdomen dark 

 brown, the abdominal sutures rather broadly pallid; tibiie and tarsi 

 broT\ai, femora pallid; hind femora with a row of short black bristles 

 on under side; wings reddish hyaline, -without markings. The 

 thorax (seen in lateral profile) is much more elevated or humped than 

 in M. cockerelli Joh. The venation nearly agrees with that of 

 M. cockerelli, but differs in some small details. The subcosta 

 (I follow Johannsen's nomenclature) ends on th6 costa as usual, its 

 upwardly directed end, beyond the cross-vein, is 128 (all measure- 

 ments in microns) long; the cross-vein to radius is 192 beyond base 




648 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



of the small cell Ri, and is about the middle of that cell, which is 

 quite long, as in M. obliqua (Saj')- The apical end of cell R has its 

 upper face (above separation of lower branch of radius from radio- 

 medial cross-vein) 128 microns long, and the lower face (radio- medial 

 cross-vein) 192 and more oblique; this is almost as in M. maxima Job. 

 Miocene shales of Florissant, Wilson Ranch {Wickham). Larger 

 than the fossil M. cockerelli, and differing in coloration, details of the 

 venation, and the proportions of the legs. It appears to be very close 

 to the living M. mendax Joh., a species of the Pacific coast region. 



Asilus wickhami n. sp. (AsilidsD). 



Length 18.5 mm., of which 13.25 is abdomen; wings about 11 mm.; 

 middle femora 3 mm., hind femora 4. Antennae normal; the head 

 and thorax were apparently black, the abdomen paler, somewhat 

 darker dorsally than ventrally; legs without conspicuous bristles, 

 tarsi thick; wnngs clear, nervures ferruginous. Bristles on the legs 

 can be seen with the compound microscope, but they are pale or 

 reddish, not black as in most species, and so are easily overlooked. 



As in A. peritulus Ckll., the veins at the end of the second basal 

 and fourth posterior cells form a cross; but in some other respects 

 the venation differs from that of A. peritulus as follows: 



(1) Marginal cell not so narrow at end. 



(2) Sides of second submarginal beyond base parallel until near 

 apex, when they gradually diverge; in A. peritulus the sides have a 

 gentle double curve. ^ 



(3) Second posterior cell broader at base. 



(4) Anterior cro.ss-vein about middle of discal cell; i.e., 1,440 microns 

 from base and 1,330 from apex.

 Section of the Academy). The Section has also issued 480 pages 

 and 18 plates of the Entomological News. 357 pages and 36 plates 

 have been added to the Manual of Conchology by Dr. Pilsbry. 

 This is an increase of 480 pages and 17 plates over the total output 

 for last year. 



Seven members and eleven correspondents have been elected. 

 The deaths of fifteen members and five correspondents have been 

 announced. Resignations of membership have been accepted from 

 William W. Keen, M.D., Edward Anthony Spitzka, M.D., and 

 C. Hartman Kuhn. Four members were dropped for non-pajanent 

 of dues. 



A final report of the Centenary Celebration was read at the meeting 

 of December 2, 1913. A resolution expressive of the Academy's 

 appreciation of the work of the Committee having charge of the 

 celebration was adopted and duly recorded in the published Pro- 

 ceedings.

The manuscript history of the Academy, prepared by the Record- 

 ing Secretary in connection with the Centenary proceedings and 

 accepted for publication in 1912, has been for some time ready for 

 the printer, but awaits the necessary appropriation for its issue in 

 proper form with desirable illustrations. The requisite amount is 

 believed to be S1800 for an edition of, say, 500 copies. 



The Hayden Memorial medal was presented to Dr. Henry Fair- 

 field Osborn for his distinguished work in palaeontology at a special 

 meeting held November 24. The presentation address was made 

 by the President and responded to by the recipient of the award. 



The lectures delivered to the pupils of the Girls' High School, 

 referred to in the last report, were continued with gratif\'ing results 

 until April 15. During the current season so far two lectures of a 

 similar course have been delivered by Dr. Skinner, two by Dr. 

 Pilsbrj^ and one by Dr. Moore. 



The regular course to the public was delivered on Monday evenings 

 from January 5 to April 27 as follows: Three by Dr. Witmcr Stone,

REPORT OF THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY. 



In the foreign relations of the Academy during the past year the 

 most noteworthv circumstance was the marked decrease in the 




1914.J NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 651 



volume of incoming correspondence as a result of the diminished 

 activities of European scientific institutions since the outbreak of 

 the war. 



Correspondents reported deceased during the year were Albert 

 Guenther, Carl Chun, Edward Suess, Frederick W. True, Theodore 

 Gill, August Weismann and Charles Sedgwick Minot. Those 

 elected were Edgar A. Mearns, Frank M. Chapman, Charles W. 

 Richmond, Edmund Heller, Gerrit S. Miller, Nathaniel C'harles 

 Rothschild, Marie Curie, Charles T. Ramsden, Shibasaburo Kitasato, 

 Frank Dawson Adams and Alfred Werner. 



While a large number of scientific congresses in which the Academy 

 was invited to take part had been scheduled for the year, all of those 

 of an international character were either abandoned or postponed. 

 In those cases in which the Academy was asked to express an opinion 

 upon the advisability of so doing, our vote was cast in favor of 

 postponement, as conditions in Europe seemed likely to preclude the 

 attendance of a representative body of foreign delegates. In cases 

 where delegates had been already appointed they were requested to 

 allow their names to stand as the representatives of the Academ.y 

 until the postponed meetings shall have convened. At the Atlanta 

 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 

 held in the early part of the fiscal year, Dr. Henry Skinner and 

 Dr. Philip P. Calvert were the Academy's delegates. Dr. John 

 Mason Clarke served as a delegate to the exercises inaugurating 

 John Huston Finley as President of the University of the State of 

 New York, and Professor J. G. Hidalgo was appointed to a like 

 position in connection with 150th anniversary of the National 

 Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona.

The decrease in the number of accessions as compared to the 

 growth of last year is partlj' owing to a curtaihnent of appropriations 

 and partly to the interference of the war with the publication and 

 transmission of foreign periodicals. 



The issue of German journals, at first interrupted, has now been 

 resumed, and they, just at present, are being received with tolerable 

 regularity. Scarcely anything, except the Comptes Rendus of the 

 Academy of Sciences and the Society of Biology reaches us from 

 France, and these curtailed in size. ■ Needless to say, nothing has 

 come from Belgium since the invasion. The fine annual package 

 from the Catholic University of Louvain will probably never be 

 received again. 



The amount at the disposal of the Library Committee has per- 

 mitted of the binding of only 218 volumes. 



The Card Catalogue is being thoroughly revised by Mr. Fox and 

 information secured regarding incomplete sets, many of which, 

 it is found, are in their present condition because of the death of 

 the authors or the discontinuance of publication. 



A proposition to amend the By-Laws so as to permit of the loaning 

 of books from the Librarj', on which adverse action had been taken 

 last year, was again referred to the Council and will prol)ably be 

 reported on favorabl3^ Final action on this and other propositions 

 will not be taken by the Academy until the third Tuesday in January. 

 They will be more particularly dealt with in next year's report. 



The Librarian was granted leave of absence to attend the Inter- 

 national Exposition of Book Industries and the Graphic Arts in 

 Leipzig and subsequently the meeting of the British Library Associa- 

 tion at Oxford. On the breaking out of the war all idea of reaching 

 Leipzig had to be abandoned and news of the postponement of the 

 Oxford meeting soon followed. In the intermediate time between 

 the first moliilization of troops and the beginning of actual fighting 

 the journey from Milan to London was made with no disaster and 

 the minimum of inconvenience. Earlier and later efforts to make 

 the passage were much more serious matters. 



During the Librarian's absence the routine business of the library 



was carried on with characteristic efficiency by his assistants, William 



J. Fox and Furman S. Wilde, to whom he is glad to again make 



deserved acknowledgment. 



Edward J. Nolan, Librarian.

IV. REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The year just completed has been marked by important progress 

 in the arrangement and study of the collections and bj- the accession 

 of much valual)le material. 



The IMuseum has lieen TOited by a large number of persons and 

 there has been a constant increase in the schools and classes which 

 have come, under the guidance of teachers, to study the collections. 

 Classes in sketching from the School of Industrial Art have made use 

 of the Museum every week during the winter months, and students 

 from the natural history department of the Girls' High School have 

 studied the collections regularly throughout the school j-ear. The 

 Department of Health of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has 

 continued to occupy the quarters in the building allotted to it by the 

 Academy some years ago. 



The movement of the centre of the city westward has been dis- 

 tinctly noticeable in the increased number of visitors to the Museum, 

 and the completion of the Parkway, which will pass the front of the 

 Academy, will have a still greater influence in this direction. 



In the building, necessary repairs to the roof and heating plant 

 have been made during the year. The marble wainscoting in the 

 entrance hall has been moved out and backed by brick to form a 

 support for the larger Icthyosaurus fossils which have been mounted 

 thereon, adchng greatly to the appearance of the hall. 



A number of large palms in tubs, gift of Mrs. Curwin Stoddart, 

 Jr., have been placed in the entrance halls and t\w minoralogical 

 room. 



Seven plate-glass exhibition cases have been purchased during the 

 year, three for the mammal and four for the archaeological hall, while 

 plate-glass frames have l)een provided for covering the large fossils 

 in the entrance hall. 



Twenty-six metal-covered storage cases have been purchased for 

 the study s^eries of mammftls and shells, a« well as 102 insect boxes 

 and 450 trays. 



Mr. Clarence "B. Moore conducted two explorations among the 

 Indian burial mounds along the Tennessee River, adding some valua- 

 ble material to the Clarence B. Moore Collection in the .\rclupoiogical 

 hall. While the results were not so rich as heretofore in the matter 

 of .specimens, the information obtained is of the greatest importance. 



Leave of absence was granted to several members of the Museum 

 staff during the year for the purpose of conducting collecting expedi- 

 tions in the field. Dr. Henn,' Skinner spent the month of February 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 657 



in Cuba as the guest of Mr. Charles T. Ramsden and collected ex- 

 tensively for the Academj^ receiving valuable assistance from Mr. 

 Ramsden. 



Dr. Witmer Stone spent two weeks in May collecting in central 

 South Carolina, while Air. Stewardson Brown made another trip to 

 Bermuda. Both secured valuable material. Other members of the 

 staff carried on considerable local field work, which yielded valuable 

 results. Details of museum work and important accessions in the 

 • various departments follow. 



Mammals. 



For the exhibition series the taxidermist, Mr. David McCadden, 

 has devoted considerable time to the mounting of a number of East 

 African Antelopes, a Giraffe and an African Forest Pig, collected by 

 Me.ssrs. A. M. Collins and E. M. Scull. A very fine Buffalo bull, 

 obtained a few years ago from the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, 

 was also mounted for exhibition. 



Some time was also devoted to the mounting of the skeleton of the 

 large fin-back AVhale obtained at Ocean City, N. J., in 1891. This 

 specimen has been erected in the north hall of the Museum and 

 presents a very fine appearance. Mr. McCadden was assisted in 

 this work by Mr. Edw. W. Stiicke, whose services were secured for 

 part of the year. 



Seventeen mammals were received from the Zoological Society 

 and have been variously prepared for mounting, skins, or osteological 

 specimens. Most important of these was a skeleton of the Indian 

 Elephant. 



The entirs mammalian osteological collection has been assembled 

 during the year in the mammal room on the fourth floor, where 

 metal-covered cases have been provided for its reception. As soon as 

 the collection is thoroughly rearranged it is thought that it will offer 

 as good facilities for the study of mammalian osteology as can be 

 found in any museum in America. 



Mr. Childs Frick spent considerable time in ' the department 

 studying the Donaldson Smith collection in connection with his 

 report on the material obtained by him in Africa. 



Mr. Vernon Bailey also visited the Museum for the purpose of 

 studj-ing the series of Thomonnjs, and specimens have been loaned 

 for study to Dr. J. A. Allen, Messrs. R. C. Andrews, E. W. Nelson, 

 G. S. Miller, Jr., and W. H. Osgood. 



Dr. Witmer Stone made a critical study of the mammals collected 




658 PKOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



by Mr. S. N. Rhoads in Ecuador and prepared a report on them, 

 which has Iseen pulilished in the Proceedings. 



Birds. 



Additions to the exhilaition series consist of several local specimens 

 received from the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club, a group of 

 Swallow-tailed Kites from Texas, presented by Mr. George B. Benners, 

 and a group of Heath Hens from Marthas Vineyard, the gift of 

 Mr. Frederick H. Kennard, which have been recently mounted. 



A large series of beautifully mounted birds, mainly from Texas 

 and Pennsylvania, has been presented by Mr. Benners, which will 

 be substituted for less desirable specmiens in the general exhibit just 

 as soon as cases can be secured for storing the duplicate material 

 that must bo withdrawn! from exhibition before this collection can 

 be rearrangetl. 



The renovation of the study collection has continued without 

 interruption. Mr. D. E. Culver, student on the Jessup Fund, has 

 proceeded with the relaxing of the old unmounted specimens and 

 has completed all of the Tanagridse, Icteridse, Ploceidae, Dicruridae, 

 Oriolidse and Turdidae. The fronts of the trays have been painted 

 with white enamel and all the cases and trays have been relabelled 

 and lined with sheet cotton, from the Psittacidse to the beginning of 

 the Passeres. 



Dr. Stone has also rearranged 'the Pigeons and Birds of Prey and 

 has reidentified the entire collection of Humming-birds. 



The type specimens iiavc likewise been relaxed and relabelled. A 

 number of spcchnens have l)een identified for the Zoological Society 

 and for correspondents, and a card catalogue of all new species of 

 birds descril)ed since 191 1 has been compiled for use in the stvidy room. 



A valuable series of bird skins from Santa Marta, Coloml)ia, was 

 received by purchase and a small number from West Africa. 



Mr. Gregory M. Mathews sjient two days at the Academy stutiying 

 the Gould t.vpes in connection with his great work on the birds of 

 Australia, and Prof. W. W. Cooke examined the collection for Texan 

 specimens. Many local students have also made use of the study 

 material, and specimens were loancil to Mc>srs. E. \V. Nelson. Frank 

 M. Chapman, Harry C. Oberholser and Dr. E. A. Mearns. 



Reptiles and B.\trachians. 



Mr. Henry W. Fowler ha.s looked after this department during 

 the year and has identified and prepared for preservation all the new 




1914.) NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 659 



material received, numl^cring several hundred specimens, of which 

 about 100 have been catalogued. 



The stuffed reptiles of the old collection, as well as the reptilian 

 osteological material, have been gathered together in a room on the 

 fourth floor, where they are readily accessible. Specimens have 

 been loaned to Dr. L. Stejneger for study. 



Fishes. 



The ichthyological collection has also been under Mr. Fowler's 

 care. He has examined the main alcoholic collection and prepared, 

 identified and labelled all the specimens obtained during the year, 

 cataloguing some 2,600 individuals. ' Numerous local trips that he 

 has taken have added large series of Pennsylvania and New Jersey 

 fishes to the collection. 



He has also studied critically the large group of catfishes and 

 related forms contained in the Museum and has a report on them 

 now in preparation. Papers have been published on Greenland, 

 British Guianan, and local fishes in the Academy's Proceedings. 



MOLLUSKS. 



Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, special curator of this department, reports 

 that accessions have been received during the year from 69 persons 

 and institutions. No small part of his time, as well as that of Mr. 

 E. G. Vanatta, has been taken up in determining specimens for 

 correspondents, and while this work is rendered freely by the 

 Academy, as a service it owes to the public, it is abundantly repaid 

 by the gifts of desired specimens. 



Although no expeditions have been undertaken during the year 

 for this department, Messrs. Ferriss and Daniels have shared the 

 results of their summer's collecting in Arizona, covering a district 

 not before worked for moUusks, and local collecting trips by members 

 of the Museum staff have added some valuable material. 



Considerable progress has been made in determining and labelling 

 the Hawaiian material collected by Dr. Pilsbry in 1913; the assorting 

 of mixed lots having been completed, so that all species not yet 

 determined are available for convenient study. The study and 

 arrangement of the Achatinellidm have been completed. 



The series of American land shells and of land operculates have 

 been cleaned and catalogued by Miss Caroline Ziegler, who has 

 also been occupied with assorting material received from various 

 sources. 




660 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Dec, 



Dr. Pilsbry has completed the pubhcation of a monograph of the 

 Hawaiian tree snails, Achatinellidie, together with a supplement 

 describing new material collected in 1913. The preparation of a 

 monograph of the family Tornatellinidce, also largely Hawaiian, is 

 well advanced. 



Insects. 



Dr. Henry Skinner, head of the department of Entomology, reports 

 that he and Mr. E. T. Cresson, Jr., have rearranged the families 

 GyrinidiB, Hydrophilidie and part of the Scarabseidae among the 

 Coleoptera and the exotic and American Syntomidse, Uranidae and 

 the genus Catagramma among the Lepidoptera. Considerable time 

 has also been devoted to a study of over 8,000 Acalyptrate Diptera. 



Dr. Horn's types of Coleoptera in the families Throscida;, Mala- 

 chidae, Cleridae, Ptinidse, Lucanidse and Scarabseidae have been 

 located and numbered, as well as many of Grote's types of Moths. 



The local collection is being entirely rearranged in cabinets in the 

 Entomological rooms, where it is easily accessible and can be added 

 to from time to time. The arrangement of the Odonata, Orthoptera, 

 Lepidoptera, Rhopalocera, and part of the Heterocera and Coleop- 

 tera has been completed. 



In the Orthoptera Mr. J. A. G. Rehn has rearranged the Blattidae 

 and Dermaptera, the exotic Mantidae and a considerable portion of 

 the North American Tettigoniid.te. He has been engaged more or 

 less regularly throughout the year, in conjunction with Mr. Morgan 

 Hebard, in studying the Orthoptera collected by them in the south- 

 eastern United States, together with material from the same area 

 loaned by Cornell University, the State of Georgia and individual 

 collectors. In this connection six genera were critically revised, 

 and papers on them are in press or in process of comi)letion. 



Mr. Rehn has also made considerable progress in the study of 

 Brazilian Orthoptera received from various sources and has .started 

 upon the determination of .\frican collections suinnitted by the 

 Berlin Museum and German National Entomological Museum, 

 from which the .\cademy will receive a duplicate series. A collec- 

 tion of Phasmidte from New (Juinea, sent by the Royal Zoological 

 Society of Amsterdam, is to lie worked up on the same terms. 



Mr. Hebard, who has spent nmch time studying his private col- 

 lection, which is deposited at the Academy, has ])resented many 

 specimens originally in the Bruiicr colliction and has continued to 

 maintain a preparator whose services have been given liberally to the 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 661 



Academy in connection with the Orthoptera collection. Through 

 his liberality also, Mr. Rehn was enabled to accompany him to 

 Boston and Washington to study type material. 



The Entomological department has received many valuable 

 accessions during the year. A series of 5,296 moths and other 

 insects, the collection of the late Charles S. Welles, was presented by 

 Mrs. Welles, while Mr. C. C. Deam presented 892 Lepidoptera from 

 Florida and Guatemala. Dr. Witmer Stone collected 612 insects 

 in central South Carolina, and Dr. Skinner some 1,500 specimens 

 from eastern Cuba, one-third of which were Lepidoptera. Numerous 

 local specimens were also collected or presented. 



Many specialists have availed thiemselves of the opportunity of 

 studying the collections, among whom were Messrs. A. N. Caudell, 

 W. T. Davis, Charles T. Ramsden, W. P. Comstock, F. E. Lutz, 

 R. A. Leussler, C. T. Alexander. 



Other Invertebrates. 



Dr. H. A. Pilsbry has spent considerable time in the study of the 

 Cirripeds of the Academy and the National Museum Collections, 

 upon which he has prepared a report. With the addition of dupli- 

 cates from the National Museum received in return for this work, 

 the collection of the Academy is now believed to be the third in the 

 number of species represented. 



Mr. Fowler has cared for most of the other alcoholic Crustacea 

 and lower invertebrates received during the year and has been 

 instrumental in securing a large number of local specimens, so that 

 the collection is now fairly representative of the local fauna. He 

 cleansed the entire series of local Arachnida and ^Ij'riapoda, placing 

 them in new vials, which were then arranged in large jars and flooded 

 with alcohol. 



Invertebrate Fossils. 



Mr. E. G. Vanatta has catalogued and labelled the collection of 

 British Crag Fossils. Little has been accomplished in the rearrange- 

 ment of the palaeozoic material which is badly in need of study. 



The recent accessions have been studied, identified, and arranged 

 by Dr. Pilsbry, notably the Vickers-Oberholtzer Collection of Oeland 

 fossils and various small lots of tertiary and cretaceous. Dr. Amos 

 P. Brown has also continued, as opportunity arose, to render generous 

 assistance in this department. A fine group of siliceous sponges 

 from the Upper Devonian of New York has been presented by 

 Dr. John M. Clarke. 




662 proceedings of the academy of [dec, 



Vertebrate Fossils. 



Much progress has lieen made in bringhig the collections in this 

 department into order. Mr. J. A. G. Rehn has cleansed and cata- 

 logued the entire series of mammalian and avian remains and finished 

 the systematic arrangement of all the smaller specimens in trays 

 under the cases on the gallery of the north wing. Mr. Henry W. 

 Fowler has done the same for the fishes which are arranged in drawer 

 cases on the fourth floor. He has also catalogued the entire series 

 of reptiles. Dr. Stone has temporarily arranged the reptiles and 

 larger mammalian specimens in old cases in the north wing which 

 have been renovated for the purpose. This brings the material all 

 together, but new cases will be required before it can be systematically 

 displayed. Material has been loaned during the year to Drs. R. W. 

 Shufeldt and L. Hussakof. 



Herbarium. 



Mr. Stewardson Brown, who has had charge of the coliectioas of 

 plants, was absent for nearly half the year on account of severe 

 illness, but the department was looked after by Messrs. S. S. Van 

 Pelt and Bayard Long, who have generously devoted almost their 

 whole time to the care and development of the local collection of 

 plants. 



The work in the general herbarium has been mainly devoted to 

 caring for the numerous accessions. Miss Ada .\llen has continued 

 to do the mounting and Mr. Brown has labelled, catalogued and 

 distributed the sheets as well as identified many specimens for 

 correspondents. 



Through an arrangement with the trustees of Lafayette College, 

 the herbarium of the late Dr. Thomas C. Porter has been deposited 

 in the Academy. It is conservatively estimated to contain 30,000 

 sheets of plants, among which is the series of the Pennsylvania flora 

 which served as the basis of Dr. Porter's State list. The herbarium 

 of the late Charles S. Williamson; containing some 10,000 sheets, 

 has been presented by his sister. Miss Williamson. Through the 

 assistance of Mrs. Beulah M. Rhoads and the Botanical Section, it 

 was possible to purchase the valuable collection of 1900 ferns and 

 fern allies made by Mr. W. A. Poyscr, which adds greatly to the 

 completeness of this section of the Academy's herbarium. The 

 Botanical Section also presented 800 sheets of California plants. 

 Dr. \Mtmer Stone collected 500 siieets in South Carolina and Mr. 




1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 663 



Brown 200 in Bermuda; 1,300 others were received from various 

 donors. Messrs. Long and Van Pelt have voluiitarily assumed care 

 of the local herbarimn, and some 4,000 specimens were added during 

 the year. Mr. Van Pelt has devoted his time to poisoning and 

 mounting the material, while Mr. Long has done much local field 

 work, critically studied the material and identified and labelled it. 



Dr. Stone spent some time in arranging and sorting the lower 

 orders, in the Porter herbarium preparatory to having the specimens 

 mounted. 



Specimens have been loaned for scientific study to Messrs. K. K. 

 McKenzie, J. K. Small, Harold St. John, C. S. Sargent and M. L. 

 Fernald. 



Minerals and Rocks. 



The Curator of the William S. Vaux Collections, INIr. F. J. Keeley, 

 reports that Mr. Samuel G. Gordon, a student on the Jessup Fund 

 during the year has completed the cataloguing of the minerals. 

 Thirteen additions have been made during the year. The collection 

 now numbers 8,193 specimens. The catalogue of the general Acad- 

 emy collection has also been brought up to date and comprises 

 8, .508 entries. This collection has been rearranged by Mr. Gordon 

 in trays under the cases in the archaeological hall, in accordance 

 with Dana's classification (sixth edition) , and is thus easily accessible 

 for study or consultation. 



The local collection of minerals was thoroughlj- cleansed and 

 ' rearranged geographically. While laclcing a number of local minerals, 

 it is good representative collection. 



All the rocks stored in various parts of the north museum building 

 have been brought together and arranged in temporary cases of 

 drawers by Mr. Gordon, following Rosenbusch's system, so that 

 they may be ea.silj- consulted. 



Archeology and Ethnology. 



In this department the material obtained by Mr. Clarence B. 

 Moore's expeditions has been placed on exhibition under his direction. 



Two cases were procured for the display of portions of the Wm. S. 

 ^'aux Collections, which have been withdraA\ni from exhibition for 

 several years, owing to changes in the hall during alterations. 



Two other cases were installed for exhibiting portions of the 

 Pueblo pottery and basketry contained in the Gottschall Collection. 

 This collection, comprising about 5,000 specimens, was presented 




664 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [DeC, 



by Mr. A. H. Gottschall, of Harrisburg, Pa., who gathered it together 

 from 1871 to 1892. It forms an exceedingly valuable collection of 

 ethnographic and archaeological material, which .strengthens the 

 Academy's department where it was weakest. The greater part 

 of the collection is still of necessitj^ preserved in storage; but beside 

 the exhibit mentioned, Miss H. N. Wardle, who superintended the 

 packing and unpacking of the collection, has picked out, labelled 

 and- catalogued some 350 pieces of Eskimo and northwest coast 

 material. Miss Wardle has had to rearrange a large part of the 

 ethnographic exhibition to make room for these accessions. 



A series of 89 European Stone Age artefacts found among the 

 Fourier Collections of fossils were turned over to Miss Wardle and 

 have been cleansed, catalogued and labelled. 



Another valuable addition to the department has been a gift of 

 numerous pieces of basketry, etc., from Mrs. Curwin Stoddart.

REPORTS OF THE SECTIONS. 



Many of the statements heretofore found in the reports of the 

 Sections are now included in the Curators' Rci)ort. 



Biological and Microscopical Section. — Eight stated meetings 

 have been held during the year. 



The following connnunications were made: 



Mr. F. J. Keeley described various species of diatoms, including 

 specimens he had collected in Florida. 



Mr. T. C. Palmer, besides other communication.s, described 

 species of diatoms he had collected in Yellowstone Park. 



Mr. Hugo Bilgram exhibited c(>rtain varieties of Myxomycetes,
