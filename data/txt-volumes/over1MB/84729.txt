Trautivineite^ a Xeic Mh^eral. — By E. Goldsmith. A mineral on 

 chromite. from California, was given to me for examination by Mr. 

 Trautwine, who requested me to ascertain whether it was chrome- 

 green. The mineral has a green color ; the hardness is between 

 1 and 2. With the naked eve the material appears to be amor- 

 phous, but, observed under high power, it proves to be cr3'stallized ; 

 it is therefore microcrystaliine. The regular forms, which I saw, 

 were short hexagonal pyramids, the infinite pyramid (prism), and 

 triangular slender prisms, which ma^' be one-sixth sections of the 

 hexagonal prism ; I presume that this latter form is sometimes 

 called microlitic. When the substance is moistened on a glass 

 slip, covered and placed between the two crossed nicol prisms, 

 light is transmitted, with the usual phenomena of coloration. In 

 regard to colors, I may note here, that the infinite pyramid shows 

 by transmitted light a red color, but b}- reflected light it is green. 



Under ordinar}' circnmstances the mineral is dull, but when 

 observed under power it aj^pears vitreous. The streak is light 

 green. 



Pyrochemical tests: In the glass tube, closed on one end, when 

 heated to redness it shows a little water, and turns bluish-green. 



In borax, also in microcosmic salt, the material dissolves entirely 




10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



when heated long enough. The glass beads are green after cooling, 

 having been subjected to the oxidizing or the reduction fire. 



Carbonate of soda dissolves it, forming a yellow mass in the 

 oxidizing, and a green one in the reduction flame. In acids the 

 substance is not soluble, except some iron with which it is con- 

 taminated. 



The further qualitative chemical examination indicated the 

 oxides of chromium, iron, and magnesium. 



For want of means the quantitative determination of those ele- 

 ments was not undertaken, but reserved for some future time. 



The mineral known under the name of chrome-ochre must not be 

 confounded with the above, for chrome-ochre is described to be a 

 silicate of alumina, tinged with the sesquioxide of chromium. We 

 are also told that it is amorphous, and its occurrence on por- 

 phyry near Halle, and near Waldenburg in Silesia, or on a conglo- 

 merate, as near Creuzot in France, sliows I think sufficient differ- 

 ences not to consider it to be identical with the California mineral 

 on the chromite. My impression is, that the mineral described 

 is a new species, and if so, I would propose to name it in honor 

 of Mr. John C. Trautwine, the first observer, Trautivineite. 



Prof. Cope remarked, that, through the kindness of Prof. B. F. 

 Mudge, he had an opportunit}- of examining additional specimens 

 of the turtle from the cretaceous of Kansas, described b}' him in 

 the Proceedings of the Academ}' 1872 p. 129. The phalanges in- 

 dicated a large flipper of the type of marine turtles. They are 

 more flattened than in the Propluridfe so far as the latter are 

 known, and are proportionally larger. The genus and species were 

 named Toxochelys latiremis.

Prof. Cope made some observations on the structui'c and sys- 

 tematic position of the genus Eohasileus Cope. Uint cither ium 

 Leidy and Dinoceras Marsli were names applied to allied Mam- 

 mals, so that the same would probably applj^ to them also. 

 They had both been originall}'- referred to the Ferissodacfyla^ by 

 their describers, and subsequently ^Nlarsh had stated (Am. Journ. 

 Sci. Arts, July 18, 1872) that" the species described by him 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 11 



{Titanotherium ?anceps) is a Proboscidian, without giving any 

 reasons therefor. The speaker, in describing the genus EobasUeus 

 (Proc. Amer. Philos. Societ}-. August 20, 1872) referred it to the 

 Proboseidia, giving as reasons the structure of the bones of the 

 leg and foot, and of the posterior part of the skull. Prof. Marsh 

 (1. c. Aug. 24) refers his species again to the Proboseidia. stating 

 as a reason, " that the limbs resemble those of Mastodon,^^ and he 

 refers it to a genus Tinoceras^ Tvithout description. Later (1. c. 

 Sept. 27, 1872), Prof. Marsh refers these animals to a new order, 

 Dinoceria(?Dinocerata),v,-{th(ivayvmg them from the Proboseidia. 

 Lastl}^ he stated, at a meeting of the American Philosophical 

 Society, Dec. 20, 1872), that this order differs from Pi'oboseidia 

 in the presence of canine teeth and horns, and the absence of in- 

 cisors. 



Until further evidence is presented, I adhere to m}'^ original 

 position, that these animals are true Probosridio. and cannot be 

 referred to any other order. The reasons are as follows : — 



1. The malar bone is rod-like, and forms the middle element of 



the zygomatic arch. 



2. The cervical vertebme are exceedingly short and transverse. 



3. In the distallj' expanded ulna supporting much of the carpus, 



and the slender radius crossing it to the outer side. 



4. The femur is without third trochanter. 



5. Its condyles are contracted, and the narrow intercondylar 



fissure is prolonged far forwards. 

 6.- The spine of the tibia is wanting, and the glenoid cavities 

 separated by a longitudinal keel. 



7. The astragalus is not hour-glass shaped above, but with a uni- 



form face. 



8. The short plantigrade calcaneum. 



9. The phalanges are short and stout, and represent several toes. 



To these may be added three external characters which directly 

 result from the osteological, viz. : — 



10. The possession of a proboscis. This is proven by the very 



short cervical vertebra, and b}' the fact that the nasal and pre- 

 maxillary bones are deeply excavated at their extremities, 

 with surrounding osseous eminences, for the origin of the 

 muscles of the trunk, and by the extreme stoutness of the 

 nasal bones. 



11. The extension of the femur below the body, so that the leg 



was extended with the knee below and free from the body, 

 as in elephants, monkey's, and men. 



12. The short plantigrade foot, so different from that seen in other 

 divisions of Ungulata. 



Other characters, common to Proboseidia and some other un- 

 gulates, are: — 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



13. The scapula acuminate in outline above the spine, witli a very 



sliort c'oracoid. 



14. Broad truncate occiput with widely separated temporal fossae. 



15. The greatl}' expanded iliac bones. 



The dentition is not far removed from that of Dinotherium. 

 The presence of canine teeth might not prove a ground of dis- 

 tinction between Elejohantidse and Eobasileui^^ since in both types 

 the tusk is embraced by both the premaxillary and maxillary 

 bones. It thus becomes exceedingly probable that the tusk of 

 Mastodon and Elephant, regarded as an incisor by Cuvier, is 

 really a canine. But should a real peculiarity exist in this point, 

 as does in the presence of horns, the two cannot distinguish the 

 family from this order. Such range of variation is well known 

 to exist in the Artiodactyla, where some Cervidae and Antelopidse 

 are horned and some not ; and where musk-deer have canines and 

 Bovidse none ; or where the omnivorous section have canines and 

 lack horns^ while Bovidae have horns and lack canines. 



The peculiar phj'siognomy of the Elephants is, as is well known, 

 produced by the enormous development of the frontal sinuses. 

 In Dinotherium this structure is greatly reduced, and in Eohasi- 

 leuH exists chiefly in the squamosal region. The physiognomy of 

 the latter is also materially affected by the great prolongation 

 forwards of the nasal bones, which support horns or processes 

 at both extremities, and by the narrowing of the snout, produc- 

 ing a somewhat pig-like expression. The palatal surface of the 

 mouth is thus greatly elongate and narrowed, and must have 

 accommodated a verj" slender tongue. These modifications are 

 but subordinate, and such as we find in ditfereut members of the 

 same order. 



On the Forms of Artificial Oxide of Zinc. By George A. 

 KoENiG, Ph.D. — The specimen under examination is a piece of 

 brick taken from a zinc furnace of Lasalle, 111. It is a gift of 

 Mr. Hegler, proprietor of the works, to C. E. Richter, M. E., 

 from whom I obtained it. I am not aware that any description 

 of its occurrence has been published, and am confirmed in this 

 belief b3' the fact that it was given to Mr. Richter as a curious 

 but unknown substance. 



The surface of the brick is covered bj'- a dirty greenish coating, 

 the nature of which could not be ascertained on account of its 

 extreme thinness. A part of the surface, about one inch square, 

 is covered by a cluster of long hair-like needles of a brilliant 

 white color and glassy lustre. These needles are very nearly 

 posed parallel to each other and to the face of the brick, present- 

 ing somewhat the appearance as if part of a goat's beard had 

 been cut oflT and put on the stone. A number of cavities in the 

 brick contain these needles also, but here they are placed trans- 

 versely like many minerals, for instance millerite. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



In order not to spoil the specimen, I took only 0.1 gramme for 

 analysis, and in this qnantit}' could not obtain any otlier reaction 

 but on zinc. This metal was first precipitated by ammoniac 

 sulphide, then redissolved and precipitated by sodic carbonate. 

 It weigiied, after ignition, 0.095 gramme. This result leaves no 

 doubt of the truth of the assertion, tliat the substance examined 

 is pure oxide of zinc. 



Placed under the microscope, with a magnifjnng power of 250 

 diameters, the needles present a purely prismatical habitus. 

 Moreover, it seems apparent from the form of the basal termina- 

 tion, that the prisms belong to the hexagonal system. 



The natural oxide of zinc, the zincite or red zinc ore, has not 

 been found jet in well-defined crj-stals; but the massiA^e specimens 

 of Sparta, Franklin and Stirling, X. J., show a distinct cleavage 

 after a hexagonal prism and after tlie hexagonal basis. Thus, the 

 identit}'^ of form in the natural oxide of zinc and in the artificial 

 oxide, would seem to be existing. 



On a Boiler Incrustation from New Jersey. By George A. 

 KoEXiG, Ph.D. — Some time ago Mr. Joseph Harrison, Jr., pre- 

 sented to the Academ}^ a specimen of boiler incrustation from 

 Orange Co., N. J. The physical properties of this incrustation 

 were remarkable enough to suggest a chemical examination. It 

 was about half an inch thick, presented a smooth surface, was 

 hard and coherent, of a brownish-flesh-color, and showed on the 

 fracture a distinct prismatic structure, the prisms standing 

 vertically on the surface. It lool<ed very much like the so-called 

 " Sjn'udelstein" from Karlsbad in Bohemia, which is aragonite. 



The analysis gave the following results: — 



Sulphuric acid (SOJ = 



Calcic oxide (CaO) = 



■ Ferric oxide ( Fe.Oj) =: 



Silicic acid (SiOj) = 



Organic substance and water = 



99.57 



57.58 parts of sulphuric acid require, by theory, 40.306 parts of 

 calcic oxide to form calcic sulphate, which latter number corres- 

 ponds perfectly with the one found ; we can sa}'^, hence, that the 

 incrustation is composed of — 



Calcic sulphate = 97.89 

 Ferric hydrate = 0.72 

 Silica 0.05 



Organic matter 0.82 



To my knowledge there has not been described, so far, a boiler 




14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



incrustation wliich is so very near chemically pure calcic sulphate, 

 and none in which this is so perfectly anlu'drous. We know that 

 calcic sulphate occurs in nature in two forms. In one it is com- 

 bined with two equivalents of water, viz.: — 



Calcic sulphate = 79.07 

 Water = 20.93 



crystallizing in oblique rhombic prisms, and is called g3q3sum. 

 Then it is found without water, crystallized in orthorhombic 

 prisms, and is named anhj-drite. 



We know further that gypsum begins to lose "water not much 

 above the boiling point of water, and can be rendered anhj-drous 

 by prolonged heating at about 200° centigrade. Still it seemed 

 of interest to ascertain what changes would take place in a satu- 

 rated solution of gypsum when evaporated under the atmospheric 

 pressure at the boiling point, and also under a higher pressure. 



A saturated solution of gypsum was kept at the boiling point 

 until an ample amount of precipitate had formed. This precipi- 

 tate consisted of minute scales with a marked silky lustre. Under 

 a magnifying power of 60 diameters the scales proved to possess 

 the characteristic tabular forms of gj'psum with the oblique basis. 

 They were perfectly transparent, and many were twins, those 

 swallow-tail shaped forms so well known. 



Upon ignition 20. T per cent, of water was found instead of 

 20.93, as required b}^ the formula. 



A saturated solution of gypsum was now sealed up into a glass 

 tube, and kept in an oil bath for fourteen hours at a temperature 

 of 148° centigrade. This temperature is equal to a pressure of 

 4.4 atmospheres, or 66 pounds to the square inch. 



A slight granular precipitate was found on the glass after re- 

 moving the tube from the l3ath and drawing off the mother liquor. 

 Under a magnifying power of 120 diameters the apparent granules 

 dissolved into stellate groups of needle-shaped crj-stals intei'mixed 

 with single needles of a larger size. Most of the crj'stals had the 

 oblique rhombic basal termination of gypsum ; but some showed 

 an orthorhombic basis. All the crystals had become opaque, 

 apparently by innumerable fissures, as a network could be dis- 

 cerned in many individuals. The presence of prismatic protu- 

 berances on some of the crj^stals standing at right angles to the 

 principal axis of the main crystal seemed very curious. 



The precipitate was now removed from the tube and cai-efuUy 

 washed, then dried over sulphuric acid. After ignition a loss was 

 produced of 3.1 per cent. Taking into consideration that not all 

 of the mother liquor was washed out and crystallized as g.yp- 

 sum, this result may be looked upon as confirmatory that the 

 whole of the precipitate is anhydrite. Professor Genth is of 

 opinion that the opaque stellate crystals are pseudomorphs of 

 anhydrite after gypsum, and there does not seem at present any 

 reason to the contrary. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



In nature we find the anln^drite associated with rock salt. Sup- 

 posing that the deposition of the chlorides of sodium and potas- 

 sium took place under a moderately high column of saturated 

 water, the pressure exercised by this column would give a satis- 

 factorj' explanation for the fact that calcic sulphate cr3'stallized 

 as anhydrite. The presence of gj^psum in the same deposits would 

 suggest a subsequent metamorphosis of the anhydrite into gypsum 

 by taking up water.

Notice of Fossil Vertebrates from the Miocene of Virginia. — 

 Prof. Leidy directed attention to some fossils, part of a small 

 collection recently received. They were found imbedded in blue 

 clay containing an abundance of fossil diatomes, among which 

 Coscinodiscus is especiall}' conspicuous. The fossil vertebrate re- 

 mains consist mainly of vertebrae and teeth of cetaceans, vertebrae 

 of bony fishes, teeth of sharks, and spines of rays. Among them 

 also there is a portion of a humerus of a bird, and several worn 

 teeth of a peccary. Besides these there are specimens which may 

 be regarded as characteristic of the following undescribed species. 



Protocamelus virginiensis. Represented by the lower last 

 premolar, and the first and last molars of an animal about the size 

 of the existing Lama, and intermediate in size to Protocamelus 

 occidentalis and P. gracilis of the tertiary of the Niobrara River, 

 Neliraska. 



Tautoga (Protautoga) conidens. Represented by a premax- 

 illary with teeth, and portion of another with the first tooth. The 

 specimens indicate a much larger species than the living Black 

 Fish Tautoga. The bones and relative position of the teeth ex- 

 hibit some peculiarities. The premaxillar}^ externally is flatter 

 than in the Black Fish, and it appears as if it did not turn 

 down in a hook-like end at its outer extremit3^ The teeth also 

 are separated by comparatively wide intervals, independently of 

 the interspaces provided for successional teeth. The form of the 

 teeth is the same as in the Black Fish. One of the specimens 

 contains the base of the first large tooth and a row behmd of 

 seven other teeth. The other specimen contains the first large 

 tooth, which is nearly half an inch in length, but proportionately 

 more robust than in the Black Fish. 



Acipenser ornatus. Founded on a dorso-lateral plate indi- 

 cating an extinct species of sturgeon of medium size. The length 

 or height of the plate is about 2^ inches ; its breadth along the 

 crest is an inch and three-fourths.

Mr. Thomas Meehan said he had the pleasure of offering to 

 the Acadera}^ some facts in regard to the fertilization of flowers 

 which confirmed the popular view that pollen of one variety had 

 an immediate influence on the structure of the fruit of another 

 variet}', as well as on the progen}' ; and also he thought furnishing 

 some entirelj' new facts in regard to tlie ability of a seed germ to 

 receive impregnation from two distinct sources. He had pre- 

 sented to the Acadeinj^ last year fruit gathered from a pear tree, 

 whicli the members -would remember had the regular seeds and 

 carpels of a pear, but the flesh was fibrous and not granular 

 as in the pear, and the external membranes or rind was that of 

 an apple. An api)le tree had its branches interwoven with that 

 of the pear, and it had been assumed that the pollen of the apple 

 had so influenced the fruit of the pear as to produce an immediate 

 effect in the wa}' presented. 



But it had been urged in some quarters that this assumption 

 was open to objection. It was now fully proved that changes 

 of form occurred through what is now known as hud variations 

 and independent of any seminal action; and it was contended 

 this might have been the case in the pear-apple referred to. That 

 there are these changes is well known. The peach is believed to 

 be a development of this character from the almond — at any rate 

 the nectarine is positively known to have sprung from a bud — 

 not from a seed of the peach. But in case it might still be argued 

 that in some way there was a latent germinal influence in the cells 

 of plants the results of cross breeding many generations past ; in 

 other words, that the new appearance was simply a reversion and 

 not a new creation, there had been some evidence in regard to the 

 sweet potato offered to the Academy a few 3'ears ago, proving 

 bud variation quite independent of any supposed reversionary 

 character derived from seminal influence. There are no closely 

 allied species to the sweet potatoes grow-n. Moreover it does not 

 flower in these northern regions; yet root stocks had been exhib- 

 ited here with tubers of two varieties distinct in color, form, and 

 other characters growing on the same plant. 



But the gentleman who sent the apples to the Academy, Mr. 

 Arnold of Paris, Canada, determined to observe the effect of cross 

 fertilization on Indian corn. He procured a very peculiar variety 

 of which Mr. Meehan exhibited an ear, not known in the vicinity 

 — a brown variety, with a circular dent at the apex — and raised 

 one plant from it. The first set of flowers were permitted to be 

 fertilized by their own pollen in order to test whether there was 

 an}^ reversionary tendenc}' in the plant, or the pollen of any other 

 variety in the vicinity. The ear now produced was the result — 

 every grain being like its parent. The corn plant produces tAvo ears 

 on each stalk. As soon as the " silk" — the pistils of this second 

 ear — appeared, the pollen — in a " tassel" — of the common yellow 

 flint corn was procured, set in a bottle of water tied near the de- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. It 



veloping ear. the plant's own tassel having been cut away some- 

 time previous. After a short time this set of male flowers was 

 removed, and a panicle of male flowers from a white varietj' was 

 introduced to the same bottle in order to afford it the opportunity 

 of operating on the same female flowers. The result was the ear 

 now presented. The base of each grain was of the yellow flint 

 corn, but the upper half of the white variety. 



Those who opposed the facts of evolution by continually cau- 

 tioning its advocates against giving way to ''imagination," and 

 •■ brilliant speculations," he thought might be profitably benefited 

 by their own suggestions. There was comparatively little to sus- 

 tain the idea of reversion, but fancied resemblance — and this re- 

 semblance not the result of a comparison of two facts side by 

 side; but a fact on one hand compared with memorj", and often 

 the distant and vague memory of another long in the past. At 

 any rate, in these experiments of Mr. Arnold, there was the test 

 applied to guard against any objection of either reversion or 

 evolution, which, though not absolutel}' perfect, was as near so as 

 the vast mass of human experience was; and the result was he 

 thought no escape from the couchision. not only that there was 

 an immediate influence on the seed and the whole fruit structure 

 by the application of strange pollen ; but the still more important 

 faet, hardly before more than suspected, that one ovule could re- 

 ceive and be aflected by the pollen of two distinct parents, and 

 tiiis too after some time had elapsed between the first and second 

 impregnation.

MATERIALS FOR THE STUDY OF THE PHYTOPHAGA OF THE UNITED 



STATES. 



BY G. R. CROTCH, M. A. CANTAB. 



The following paper does not profess to be an exhaustive mono- 

 graph upon this group ; for such a work the time is not come, and 

 the species here noticed will be nearlj'^ doubled if they are dili- 

 gently collected and observed in diiTerent States. In particular, 

 I would call attention to the Halticini, as being in almost a com- 

 plete chaos. I have endeavored to diagnose the various genera, 

 adding as few as possible at present, and to give tables, and often 

 diagnoses of all the species ; in some intricate genera, I have, 

 however, abstained from remark. The immediate object of this 

 pul>licatiou is to make known the numerous unnamed species 

 common in collections, in order that they may be inserted in the 

 lorthcoming check list of the Coleoptera of the United States, 

 now printing at Salem. All the species described are from the

For a full description of these species the reader is referred to 

 Leconte's synopsis, in the Proceedings of the Academy for 1852. 

 Several species therein described are here marked as varieties, 

 possibly in some cases incorrectly; but I have included only 

 those species that I could definitel}' tabulate out, and rejected all 

 others. The synonymy thus introduced will stand thus : D. 

 rufescens = pulchella = lucida ; D. congener = alufacea = pisca- 

 trix ; D. con flueyis =fulgens = suht\\is ; D. aurifer ■= dives =i^u- 

 si7/a=cuprea ; D. 5fe?i/i72s=metallica; D. sidcicoUis=zD. Kirbyi. 

 I am unable to add anything about the doubtful species, of which 

 types must be compared ; of species described since, D. Gali- 

 /ornzca =proxima, D. J«(??cz=emarginata, and D. puhescens yi\\\ 

 be found above. 



D. pabicollis, sp. n.

 Illinois. Very distinctly the rounded elytra, simple femora, and 

 pubescent thorax. 



D. texana, sp. n. 



Head and thorax narrow, elytra rather broad, triangular ; be- 

 neath silvery, above dark-green ; eyes prominent, head sulcate, 

 bituberculate in front ; thorax broader than long, alutaceous, 

 hai'dly punctulate ; elytra smooth, interstices flat, broad, the rows 

 of punctures golden-green ; legs and antennae aeneous, base of 

 femora pale. L. .40. Texas. 



The only other genus belonging to this sub-family is Macroplea 

 (Hsemonia), readily recognized by the glabrous testaceous surface, 

 and by its elj^tra produced into a spine at the apex. The only 

 species is ff. Melsheimeri^ which lives in rivers clinging to aquatic 

 plants, and may be found throughout the summer. 



OKSODACHNIDES. 



A. Anterior coxal cavities open, thorax with sides dentate. Syneta. 



B. Coxal cavities closed.

 pubescence. L. .22-.26. Atlantic region. 



This species is extremely variable, the thorax is black or red, 

 and the elytra are black or ochreous, with tlie suture and margins 

 black ; the legs are red or black. From these varieties have been 

 formed the hepatiGa and vittata of Say, the bimttata of Lacordavre, 

 the ruJicoUis and inconstans of jS^ewman, and the arnieniacas of 

 German Abren's name is much older than any of these.

So many species of this genus have been described by Suffrian

 into which he divides the genus are hardlj- satisfactorj', and I 

 have used the J* characters in preference. 



A. First A'entral segment with a large plate produced into two 

 acute diverging points behind; prosternum with an acute tubercle 

 between the coxae. Here belong C. liturahcs, Fabr. (from which 

 I doubt the propriety of separating C. lativittis, S. vittatus)., C. 

 congestus, Fabr., formosus, Mels., detritus, Oliv., sellatus, Suff. ; 

 also C. sidphuripennis, Mels., areolafus, Suff., maminifer, Newm.

In the group of verj^ small species at the end of the genus I 

 have recognized G. catarius, Suff., G. a^iratus, Fab. (with which 

 I unite G. aeneolus, Lee, G. chalcoyiotus, Mann., G. viridis, Hald.) 

 G. atomus, Suff., G. chlorizans, nanus, luscus, pallidicornis, re- 

 main unknown to me. G. gracilis rests on the original Fabrician 

 example of G. parvidus, which is identical with the European 

 species ; as this is the only specimen, and the onlj' species common 

 to the two counti'ies, it seems to me better to omit it. G. leeois

GAIERTJCIDES. 

 Tribe Galerucini. 



The species of this subfamily have been carefull3'^ worked out 

 by Dr. Leconte in the Proceedings of the Academy for 1865. 

 Since then, much Californian and other material has accumulated, 

 and I find it necessary to add a few species and rearrange some 

 of the preceding ones. 



The only additions since Leconte's paper are Luperus luteicoUis, 

 L. varicornis, Phyllechlhrus nigripennis, Diahrotica blandula, 

 D. virgifera, described by Dr. Leconte in the Transactions of 

 the American Entomological Society for 1868, and Andrector 

 (g. n.) %-punctatus^ b}" Dr. Horn, in 1872. Malacosoma, the two 

 species referred by Dr. Leconte to this genus, appear to me to 

 belong to the Halticini. 



Phyllectlirus dorsalis (01 iv ). 



I cannot separate specifically P. atripennis (Say), which differs 

 only in color. 



Pliyllecthrus gentilis, Lee. 



P. nigripennis also differs only in color ; I do not see that these 

 color variations, however constant, are indicative of more than 

 races ; and we are not yet in a position to say much of their con- 

 stancy even. 



Luperus brunneus (Zimm. MSS.), sp. n. 



This species has the third joint of the antennae quite short, as 

 in P. morulus ; but is much larger than that species and of a 

 shining brown color, less pale; antennai long, thorax broader 

 than long, with the el^'tra very finely' and sparingly punctulate ; 

 upper side convex, rather ventricose. L. .16. Xorth Carolina 

 (Zimmerman). 



Luperus morulus, Lee. 



The length of this species is printed .4, in error for .14. 



Luperus rufipes, Lee. 



This name has been in use in Europe since 178Y ; I have there- 

 fore changed it to L. Lecontii. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 55 



Androlyperus (g. n.)- 

 A. fulvus, sp. n. 



Ovate, rather depressed, shining, fulvous ; head, scutellura, 

 metasternura, legs, and antennte black ; thorax rather longer 

 than broad, coarctate behind, sides and base margined, disk 

 smooth ; elytra impunctate. L. .20. Coast Range, S. of San 

 Francisco (Horn). 



J" First ventral segment deepl}^ foveolate, third and fourth 

 concave, each with a long linear process curving laterally over, 

 5-6 black, concave ; elytra with a small brown spot before the 

 apex, margin deeply plicate and distorted at about |; autennte 

 sub-serrate. 



This genus, by its general appearance, its antennae, margined 

 el} tra, etc., belongs in the vicinity of Luperus ; from which it is 

 abundantly distinct by the last joint of the palpi, rather longer 

 than the preceding, acute, and b}- the prosternum distinctly visible 

 between the coxae, a character anomalous in the Galei'ucini, though 

 universal in the Halticini ; the posterior femora are in no way 

 dilated. The remarkable sexual characters have suggested the 

 name employed. 



GrALERUCA — The type of Geoffroy's genus was G. iannceti, and 

 Adimonia is merely a S3'non3'm. I propose to restrict the name 

 Galeruca to Leconte's first group, in which the anterior coxal 

 cavities are closed, and the tibiae setulose. (These characters were 

 first used by Thomson in his Skand. Col.) 



Of the five species described, G. cribrata appears to me certainly 

 to be a variety of G. americana, and G. himltata is somewhat 

 doubtful. 



Galerucella, g. n., difiers from Galeruca bj- the open coxal cavi- 

 ties. It may be divided (as Thomson has done) into groups b}'^ 

 the relative position of the mesocoxK, which are distant in G. nyni- 

 phese and sagittarise, and nearly contiguous in the other species. 



Galeruca cavicollis, Lee. 



Dr. Zimmerman's specimens were from Massachusetts and not X. 

 Carolina. ' A further series shows that it is not to be distinguished 

 from G. hsematica. 



G. marginella, Kirby. 



This certainly is the G. nymphese of Europe; G.punctipennis 

 Mannh., also is not, as far as I can see, specificallj" distinct. 




56 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



MoNOXTA. — The characters derived from the claws appear to 

 me to be certainly sexual ; hence, M. obtiisa, gntfulata, and debilis 

 are not in my opinion separable ; the type of 31. angularis has the 

 angles of the thorax more developed, but that is a character to be 

 used with caution; M. consputa is distinct by the black suture, and 

 M. sordida by the thick pubescence. 



Trihabda. — This genus includes G. viburni, Payk., and was 

 separated b\^ M. Joannis as a subgenus under the name Pyrrhalta 

 in 1866; the species are ver^' hard to define, and the increased 

 material before me leads me to different results from those arrived 

 at b}' Dr. Leconte. Nevertheless, he does not, I believe, coincide 

 in the views here expressed, preferring to retain these species as 

 distinct. 



T. tomeiitosa, canadensis, and virgata, I consider as forming 

 one variable species, with black vittoe and black scutellum; T. 

 JlavoHmbata and T. luteocincfa form another, with blue vittse, to 

 which ma}' ultimately be added T. attennata ; T. convergens ap- 

 pears distinct ; T. nitidicollis and T. breviicoUis have a more or 

 less white scutellum. 



There is still a form brought abundantly from New Mexico by 

 Dr. Lewis, which closely resembles T. nitidicollis in form, and 

 the white scutellum, but is much smaller, and the thorax is dis- 

 tinctly punctate. This variety (or species) I propose to name T. 

 Lewisii ; and it is most interesting on account of the links it 

 affords. The specimens were taken with T. nitidicollis, the vittae 

 vary from metallic green to dull black, and vary slightly in extent.

This genus is established for three small species which have 

 all the facies of a Luperus, but b}' the incrassate femora, entire

 the posterior tarsus is elongate; the anterior coxae are closed be- 

 hind, but ver}' narrowly, the base of the presternum being dilated 

 to meet the epimera; antennas long, basal joint short, claws den- 

 tate at the base.

 punctate interstices, and the posterior tarsi inserted on the side of 

 the tibifB. The species are very difficult to distinguish. P. inter- 

 stitialis and P. convexior, Lee, appear to me to be identical ; and 

 P. parvicollis, Lee., seems to me to be P. piinctulata, Mels. 



Blepharida, Chevr. 



1. B. rhois (Forst.), Cent. Ins. i. 21. 



This species is carefnllj^ described by Mr. Rogers in his paper 

 on Chrysomelidx in the Proceedings for 1856 (p. 29). I cannot, 

 however, consider it as belonging to that sub-family, and no course 

 remains but to place it as a separate group of Halticini distin- 

 guished by its bifid claws. 



CASSIDIDES. 



The number of species here enumerated is eighteen, of which two 

 are unknown to me ; but several other species have been attributed 

 to North America b^^ the earlier authors, and Mannerheim (Bull. 

 Mosc. 1853) records the European C. nobilis, Linn., as occurring 

 in Russian America. Two species of ilesomphalia have been said 

 to occur on the Mexican boundary, but are very doubtful. They 

 are easil}- recognized by the coloration, which is green with large 

 red blotches. 



The other genera are thus arranged by Boheman, in his mono- 

 graph of the group; to which reference should be made for de- 

 tailed descriptions.

NOTES ON THE PECIES OF BTJPRESTID^ FOUND IN THE 

 UNITED STATES. 



BY G. R. CROTCH, M.A., CANTAB. 



Since the revision of this family, by Dr. Leconte, ai^peared in 

 1859, considerable changes have become necessary'-, both by the 

 accretion of new material, and by the more exact determination 

 of Gorj^'s species. Dr. Leconte took with him on his recent visit 

 to Europe t^-pes of all his species ; these -were carefully compared 

 by himself and others, so that we now have a probably accurate 

 idea of the species that Gory intended to represent. This synonymy 

 has been embodied in the present pajjer, together with the results 

 of a detailed examination of all the species by myself; 'which has 

 resulted in the suppression of a certain number as races or even 

 mere varieties. In this I shall probably not be followed by some, 

 and if structural characters that I have overlooked can be pointed 

 out, I shall gladly reverse my decision. The species of Dicerca 

 and Agy'ilus, two of the most troublesome genera, have been 

 tabulated out ; but it has proved impracticable to construct a 

 similar table for Chrysobothris or Acmceodera. A certain number 

 of new species have been described from the cabinets of Drs. 

 Leconte and Horn, but the subject is far from being exhausted. 



Chalcophora. C. lacustris^ Lee, seems to me to be no doubt 

 a variety of C. virginiensis^ from which G. angulicollis can only 

 be separated as a race. Similarly the two species formed from G. 

 liberta do not appear to me to be entitled to specific rank, having 

 in consideration the great changes liable to occur in sculpture in 

 this family. 



G. langeri is certainly only G. campestris. 



PsiLOPTERA. P. Wehbii has been identified with P. Drum- 

 mondi, Gory; and I cannot see that P. Woodhousii differs in 

 any tangible manner from it. 



Dicerca. 



1. D. prolongata, Lee. 1. c. p. 194. 



This agrees well with the description of Stenura tenehrica, 

 Kirby. 



It differs from Z). divaricata \)y the darker color, and the

deeper channel on the thorax ; the % also has the emargination of 

 the last segment partly filled up with an obtuse tooth. 



2. D. divaricata (Say), Lee. p. 195. 



3. D. candata, Lee. I. c. 



I cannot see that this is anything but a smaller, less developed 

 form of the last. 



4. D. pngionata (Germ.), Lee. 1. c. p. 196. 



Yery distinct by the bidentate elytra ; the % has the last seg- 

 ment emarginate with a central tooth. 



6. D. mutica, Lee. 1. e. 



Distinct from any other species by the convex prosternum ; the 

 unique % has the last segment with a broad emargination. 



6. D. obscura (Fab.), Lee. 1. c. 



7. D. baltimorensis (Hbst.), Lee. 1. c. p. 197. 



This species is founded on a single % which I cannot dis- 

 tinguish from D. ohscura. The straight sides of the tiiorax are 

 peculiar to the % . 



8. D. soror, Lee. 1. c. 



Based on a single 9 , D- ohscura. 



9. D. lurida (Fab.), Lee. 1. c. 



After attentively examining about fifty specimens, I cannot 

 separate this species from D. obscura. No character of sculpture 

 is of any importance, and the sexual characters vary within cer- 

 tain limits; thus the emargination in the % has sometimes a 

 short central tooth, and at others is simple, and the 9 has an 

 acute or truncate tooth in the middle. 



10. D. lepida, Lee. 1. e. p. 198. 



Closely allied to D. obscitra, from which it differs b}' having the 

 thorax channelled, and the elytra with smooth reliefs. 



11. D. spreta, t Lee. 1. c. p. 193. 



This is Gory's asperata, according to the types in Mniszech's 

 collection. It has simple % tibite, as in D. lepida, but differs by 

 the short thorax. 



12. D. aiperata, t Lee. 1. c. p. 199. 



This is the D. spreta, Gory, according to the types. The male 

 intermediate tibiae are dentate. 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



13. D. tenebrosa (Kirby), Lee. I. c. 



This is certainly Kirbj-'s species, although Saunders refers it to 

 distinguenda, Lap. ; Kirby describes the apex of the abdomen as 

 tridentate, which is not applicable to D. lacustris, which Saunders 

 has united with it. 



The male intermediate tibiae are dentate. 



14 D. hilaris, Lee. I. e. p. 200. 



This belongs to the section with the abdomen rounded in the 

 female, and is in fact the 9 of D. manca.

Buprestis. Linnaeus' name should be kept for this division of

B.fasciata., Q-jylagiata, and Langii should be placed in the second 

 group with the ^ tibiae simple, and in my opinion must form 

 one species; at any rate B.fasciata and B. G-plagiata are sexes, 

 while B. Langii differs a little in general form, but in no definite 

 way. Leconte's group above is most troublesome, and further 

 observations are still necessary to settle the species. In B. lineata 

 and B. consularis the prosternum is more or less j'ellow, and the 

 elytra bidentate and in the others truncate; B. laeviventris has a 

 less strongly punctate abdomen, though I do not lay great stress 

 on this ; B. aUernans=^Nuttalli ; and all the immaculate species 

 certainly seem to me to form one species under the name B. ma- 

 culivenlris, Say. The species allied to B. st7'iata are equally un- 

 satisfactory. B. radians=lauta J*, which is known from B. striata 

 by the smooth costae ; but all transitions occur between costate 

 and striate examples, as in B. maculiventris. B. adjecta seems 

 to occur with the elytra truncate also, and one or two new inter- 

 mediate species exist in cabinet. 



Cinyra erythopa is recognized as exotic. 



Xenorhipis Brendeli, Lee, will have to be added here. 




NATURAL SCIEXCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 89 



Melanophila opaca is, I consider, a uuicolorous specimen of M. 

 notata. 



M. Drinnmondi and 31. fulvosignata are nsuall}' very distinct, 

 but some specimens from Michigan are \Qvy intermediate in sculp- 

 ture. 



M. prasina, Lee. 



Tliis name being preoccupied is changed hj Leconte in the 

 "List" to M. gentilis. 



Anthaxia. 



After carefiillv comparing all the six species of Leconte's group 

 A., I am unable to separate anj' of them specificallj- ; the glabrous 

 head of A. inornata is merely individual, and probably abraded. 



The sexual differences are very slight, and consist merely of a 

 more concave prosternum in the male. 



A. subaenea, Lee L c. p. 216. 



This I take to be the 9 of ^4. viridifrons, Grory. 



A. quercata (Fab.), Lee. 1. c. p. 217. 



This in like manner is the 9 A. cicneiformis, Gorj-. 



Polycesta. 



P. elcda, cavata, californica^ and oblusa appear to form one 

 variable species; P. obtusa is indeed a very small, probably abnor- 

 mal specimen. P. velasco is very distinct by its short suliscutellar 

 costa. 



Ptosima, gibbicollis, Say {Inctnosa auct.). 



Say's name not being now preoccupied, it must be employed 

 for this species. 



ACM^ODERA. 



Several new species have been added to the list, and four or 

 five remain undescribed, but I am entirely unable to discover anj- 

 characters except the variable ones of color, sculpture, and form ; 

 so that the limits of species appear to be merely opinionative. 



Leconte's groups based on the abdominal crest are not very 

 safe, certainly A. texana has a well-marked crest, and must come 

 next to A. pidchella, of which it is hardly more than a varietj'. 

 1 




90 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



A. culta [tuhulus^ Fab.], A. subbalteata, and A. himttata, Horn, 

 are distinct by the very short setose white erect pubescence; A. 

 gihhula is ver^^ distinct hy the prosternum produced and truncate 

 in front; this is also somewhat the case with A. comata; A. gut- 

 tifera is also very distinct by the last three segments of the abdo- 

 men being closely and densely punctate. 



Chrysobothris. 



This genus, no less than the last, is a trouble to students, but 

 here the sexual characters may be brought in satisfactorily. C. 

 soror^ Leseuri, obscu7'a, semisculjita^ and misella seem to me all 

 referable to the protean C. femorata. G. calcarata, C. cupras- 

 cens, and C. contigua form a little group with the J" tibife den- 

 tate within. C. texana resembles these in sculpture, but has the ^ 

 tibiae as in C. dentij^es. C. californica onl}' differs from C. den- 

 tipes bj'^ the larger size and hairy prosternum in the male ; C. vul- 

 canica resembles C. trinerma xcvy closely, and ma}^ be only a 

 large female of it. G. dehilis and disjuncfa do not appear to me 

 separable. G. deleta has the eyes more widely separated on the 

 vertex. G. analis I refer as a variety to G. (S-aignata. G. Har- 

 risi and G. seneola are distinct by the eyes much less approxi- 

 mate. G. purpurata, Bland, is a color variety of G. seneola. 



Agrilus, Meg. 



The somewhat numerous species of this genus are difficult to 

 determine with accuracy ; if, however, thej' were collected with 

 care, and the sexes carefully determined, the labor would be much 

 reduced. There are three or four species in collections which I 

 have not described for want of sufficient material. The charac. 

 ters are not entirely similar to the European species, especially 

 the sexual ones, which here consist of a hairy prosternum and 

 front, and a more or less distinct channel on the first two seg- 

 ments of the abdomen. These segments are connate, but the suture 

 is visible at the side in one or two species. The dorsal surface of 

 the abdomen varies remarkably in the species, and might very 

 possibly afford good characters ; I have only used it for the keel 

 on the last segment, which occasionall}^ projects. The claws are 

 bifid in some European species, but not in any American ones 

 that I have seen ; nevertheless they differ importantly, as pointed 

 out by Leconte in his paper.

Notice of Remains of Fishes in the Bridge?^ Tertiary Forma- 

 tion of Wyoming. — Prof Leidt remarked that among the multi- 

 tude of fossils which had been collected from the tertiar}- claj's 

 and sandstones of theBridger Group of Wyoming, there were com- 

 parativel}' few pertaining to fishes. Xevertheless the remains of 

 these are not unfrequent, but they are not so complete as one 

 might have expected from the nature of the beds containing them. 

 The}' usual!}' occur as isolated bones, scales and teeth, and mostly 

 indicate fishes related witli our living Gars {Lejyidosteus)., and 

 Mud Fish {Amia). 



Prof. Marsh has already noticed several species of these fishes 

 in the Proceedings of this Academy, 18T1, p. 105, from the Bridger 

 beds. Two of the species belong "to the genus Amia, about the 

 size of the modern A. calva,'^ the others indicate two species of 

 Lepidosteus, "both having smooth'scales and about tlie same size 

 as the modern gar-i)ike." 



The specimens submitted to our examinations from time to time 

 consist of isolated vertebral centra, ganoid scales, fragments of 

 ja>vs with teeth, and portions of spines. Many of these appear to 

 indicate the following extinct species previously undescribed : — 



Lepidosteus atrox. Founded on remains, obtained in Prof. 

 Hayden's expedition of 18T0, at the junction of the Big Sandy and 

 Green Rivers. They indicate a fish larger than the Alligator Gar 

 of the Mississippi. A vertebral centrum from near the middle of 

 the dorsal series is 8i lines long. It is flat beneath and ornate 

 with longitudinal and somewhat reticulate wrinkles. The para- 

 poplyses are proportionately narrower than in the Alligator Gar. 

 The accompanying scales have tlieir ganoid surface perfectly 

 smooth, flat, and without markings, and they are thicker than in 

 the Alligator Gar. 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Lepidosteus. Another species, indicated by remains accom- 

 pan^'ing the preceding, was about the size of the Gar pike, Lepi- 

 dosteus osseus, and is propably one of those named b^'' Prof. 

 Marsh. A posterior dorsal has the centrum about 5f lines in 

 length, and an accompan^'ing caudal centrum is 5 lines in length. 

 This was likewise provided with smooth flat scales. 



Lepidosteus simplex. A species approximating in size the 

 Alligator Gar, is indicated b}*- some remains collected by James 

 Stevenson, of Prof. Hayden's party of 1870, near Washakie Station. 

 The articular cup of the basi-occipital bone is five lines high and 

 ten liu'S wide. The centrum of the atlas is four lines long and 

 ten lines wide. The accompan^'ing scales are flat and smooth. 



Lepidosteus notabilis. Founded on the centrum of an anterior 

 dorsal imbedded in a block of sandstone with casts of fresh-water 

 shells, from near Washakie. The size of the centrum is about 

 equal to a corresponding one of the Alligator Gar, but the para- 

 popl3'ses are proportionately^ short. The under surface of the 

 centrum is broad, flat, and marked with longitudinal furcate 

 ridges. The sides are perpendicular, and not slanting as in the 

 Alligator Gar. The length of the centrum is 8 lines. 



Amia (Protamia) uintaensis. Lidicated by vertebral centra, 

 discovered b}' Dr. J. Yan A. Carter, near Dry Creek Caiion. The 

 fish was proportionately broader in relation with its length than 

 in the living ^lud-fish, and was very much larger. The centrum 

 of an anterior dorsal is about double the length, and four times the 

 breadth of the same bone in Amia calva. The two ridges at the 

 bottom of the centrum in the latter are substituted b}' two oval 

 fossae. The length of the centrum is about 5^ lines, its height an 

 inch and a quarter, and its breadth an inch and three-quarters. 



An atlas, probably belonging to the same species, flat in front 

 and cupped behind, has nearl}' the same size. 



Amia (Protamia) media. Indicated by remains from the junc- 

 tion of the Sandy and Green Rivers, collected in Hayden's expe- 

 dition of 18*70. A vertebral centrum from near the forepart of 

 the dorsal series, indicates a species about twice the size of Amia 

 calva. A pair of fossos at the bottom of the centrum substitute 

 the two ridges in the latter. The length of the centrum is 5^ 

 lines, its height 10 lines, and its breadth 13 lines. 



Amia (Protamia) gracilis. A smaller species than Amia calua^ 

 indicated by a middle dorsal centrum. Its length is 1.18 lines, its 

 height 3.4 lines, and its width 3.8 lines. 



Hypamia elegans. a related genus to Amia is indicated by 

 a vertebral centrum, discovered by Df. Carter on Dry Creek. The 

 specimen from the middle of tlie dorsal series, has its sides con- 

 vergent below in a median prominence excavated into a pair of 

 oval fossffi. The species was rather larger than A. calva. The 

 length of the centrum is 2.2 lines, its depth 6.5 lines, and its 

 breadth 7.G lines. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 99 



PiMELODUS ANTiQL'us. Indicated hy man}' fragments of pec- 

 toral spines and fragments of jaws, found with remains of Le- 

 pidosteus atrox^ etc., at the junction of the Big Sandy and Green 

 Rivers. The size of the species was from a foot to eighteen 

 inches. 



PiiAREODrs ACUTUS. Represented b}- a number of jaw frag- 

 ments with teeth found in association with the remains above 

 noticed, at the junction of the Big Sand}^ and Green Rivers. The 

 dentary bone contains a single closely crowded row of long C3'lin- 

 dro-conical teeth, without any small ones behind. The shaft of the 

 teeth is straight and not curved as in Amia, but tlie short conical 

 points are abruptly bent inwardl}'. The premaxillaries contain a 

 similar row of teeth, but wi{h the points scarcel}' bent. Xine 

 teeth occnp3' a space of seven and a half lines in a fragment of 

 a dentary bone, the longest tooth being 2i lines. Seven teeth 

 occupy a space of seven lines in a fragment of a premaxillary, the 

 first of the series being 3 lines long. 



February 11. 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 

 Thirty-two members present. 



Ml*. Thomas Meehan presented an apple, which was borne by a 

 tree at Kittaning, in Pennsylvania, and which tree never produced 

 an}' flowers in the popular acceptation of the term ; but alwaj'S 

 yielded an abundance of fruit. Mr. M. said there was no novelty 

 in this circumstance, as similar cases had been placed on record ; 

 but the specimen furnished a practical illustration of some mor- 

 phological truths which could not often be demonstrated in the 

 way this afforded the opportunity of doing. 



It was admitted that a fruit was a branch with its accessor}' 

 leaves, transformed. The apple fruit was made up of a series of 

 whorls of leaves comprising five each. Cutting an apple through 

 we found a series of five formed the carpels containing the seeds. 

 Several series of whorls, very much retarded in development, 

 probabl}' formed the stamens, but this could not be well seen in 

 the apple fruit, as tliey seemed to be almost absorbed in the 

 corolla series. This was the next in order that appeared in the 

 divided apple — the green curved fibrous line which we find in all 

 apples raidwa}' between the "core" and the "rind" is the divid- 

 ing line between the series which forms the corolla, and the outer 

 series which forms the cal3-x. In this tree there are no pistils, the 

 series whicli usually goes to make up this part of the fruit struc- 

 ture being either ver}^ rudimentary or entirely wanting. Hence 

 there was no "core" to the fruit. The result of this want of de- 

 velopment was that the usual calyx basin of the apple was in 




100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



this case occupied b}^ a cavity three-quarters of an inch across. 

 There were no petals; but in phice five gland or rather bud-scale- 

 like processes, at regular distances, on the edge of the green 

 fibrous outline before referred to. The outer whorl, which usually 

 forms the calyx, was almost asepalous, as a mere scarious mem- 

 brane marked the place where the calyx segments or sepals 

 should have appeared. It was so easy in tliis specimen to trace 

 the dividing line between the outer or calycine whorl and the 

 inner or corolline whorl, which uniting and becoming succulent 

 formed the popular apple fruit, that it was worth}^ of note in this 

 connection. 



But the most interesting feature in this specimen was what were 

 probably, from their similarity in appearance, cork cells, formed 

 abundantl}' on the outside of the apple. It would seem, that, with 

 the lack of development in the inner series of whorls necessary 

 to the perfect fruit, those which remained were liable to take on 

 somewhat the character of bark structure. 



Dr. Leconte mentioned that he had published in the Proceed- 

 ings for December. 1866, a paper entitled " List of Coleoptera col- 

 lected near Fort Whipple, Arizona, bj' Dr. Elliott Cones, U. S. A., 

 in 1864-65." He had recently received a letter from Dr. Edward 

 Palmer, stating that the specimens had been collected mostly In^ 

 the latter, and in accordance with the desire of Dr. P. the fact was 

 now recorded.

The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the chair. 



Twenty-seven members present. 



The following paper was presented for publication : — 

 "Description of Mexican Ichneumonidee, Part II." B3' E. T. 

 Cresson. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan presented specimens of leaves of a Begonia 

 on which minute folioles appeared as densel}^ as hair all over the 

 upper surface, while the leaf was on the growing plant. The 

 little growths first appeared as succulent hairs, and these hair-like 

 processes subsequently divided or produced the leafy blades from 

 their apices. 



Mr. M. remarked that hairs were at any rate structural!}' but 

 graded thorns, of which bristles were an intermediate stage. 

 Spines often bore leaves, but it was unusual for thorns to do so. 

 It might not be that these leaf-bearing processes were reall}' hairs 

 though they had that appearance. 



He further observed that last year he called the attention of 

 the Academy to the fact that in some Scrophulariaceous plants, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



such as Torenia and 31imulus, the bilobecl flattened stigmas closed 

 when touched, as did tlie leaf of Dionvea muscipula. He had re- 

 centl\' noticed that the divided pistil of Tecoma jasminoides had 

 the same power. When touched witli its own pollen it closed at 

 once, and remained closed ; but if touched with any foreign sub- 

 stance it opened again after the lapse of a short time. The Big- 

 noniaceaj were closely' allied to Scrophulariaceae at any rate, and 

 the plants of each might be expected to possess this power. 



He also said that, as was well known, the violet and the balsam 

 (Impaiiens) produced two distinct forms of flowers — one with a 

 corolla and the other without — the former producing them under- 

 ground. It was remarkable that these secretly produced (cleisto- 

 genous) flowers, in which there was no opportunit}' for anything 

 but self-fertilization, should be more fertile than those which had 

 the most abundant opportunities of aid from wind, insects, and 

 other favoring influences. The Catalonian jasmine of our green- 

 houses was another illustration of this phenomenon. He had ob- 

 served, and no doubt others had often done the same, for many 

 years past, that there was a great tendency to a supposed abor- 

 tion of the flowers in this plant. But this year he had some plants 

 which failed to produce a single perfect flower. To his astonish- 

 ment these plants were covered with developing seed-vessels, while 

 in the plants producing perfect flowers there was no sign of any 

 such teudenc3^ On examining these imperfect flowers he found a 

 miniature corolla was formed, but so closel}- twisted together that 

 it could not open, and always remained inside the calyx-segments. 

 The pistils in these flowers were differentlj' formed from those in 

 the pe'fect ones. The last have the two segments of the bilobed 

 pistil coiled in a spiral manner ; tlie former has no appearance of 

 any division, but seem united into a small cone. In man>' cases 

 the style was somewhat flattened, and there appeared to be a stig- 

 matic surface along each edge. It appeared from his examination 

 that there was ver}' little pollen in the anthers of these flowers, 

 and tlie apex of the pistil was pushed beyond them, and the idea 

 occurred to him that possiblj' fertilization might occur by the way 

 of the stigmatic edge before referred to. 



Mr. Thomas G. Gentry called the attention of the Academ}' to 

 what he considered to be an interesting case of a change of habits 

 which had recentl}' occurred in the life of an ordinar}^ chickaree, 

 the SciiiKs hiidsoniiis of Pallas. During the early part of last 

 autumn, his attention was called to the fact, that the birds in 

 a certain designated locality of Mount Airj', daring the hours 

 of the night, were undergoing a system of wholesale destruction, 

 the work of small animals which were supposed to belong to some 

 species of Carnivore. Laboring under this impression, and being 

 desirous of securing a specimen or two, he started for the scene 

 of slaughter, bent upon discovering the name and character 




102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



of the animal ; 'wheu within a few rods of the place, the almost 

 deafening noise that greeted his ears, from tlie tall trees, led him 

 to suspect that all was not right. After reaching the spot, a few 

 moments of anxious waiting sufficed to reveal to him the cause 

 of the noise and the origin of the sacrifice above alluded to; for, 

 sitting upon a twig just over his head, he observed a chickaree, 

 holding in its paws a bird which it had captured, and from which 

 it was very contentedly sucking the life current. 



It is a well-established fact, he furtlier remarked, as far as he 

 had been able to verif3' it, that the numerous species of Rodents, 

 with but two exceptions at the most, subsist principally or entirelj^ 

 upon vegetable matter, especially the hard parts of plants, such 

 as huts, bark, and roots. 



Tliis habit of imitating the propensities of the Musteliclse, he 

 thought might have arisen from the habit which some squirrels 

 possess, possibly the one under consideration, of sucking the eggs 

 of birds ; the blood-sucking habit, he assumed to be an outgrowth 

 from the otlier. 



This adoption of another's mode of life by S. hudsonhis, he 

 thought a discover}' of some note, as usurpation of habits, lead- 

 ing to functional and structural changes in an animal's economj', 

 is accounted an element of no mean weight in the development 

 hypothesis, according to the testimony of able writers upon 

 Evolution. 



Prof. Cope exhibited the cranium of the horned Proboscidian 

 of Wyoming, Loxolophodon cornutus, and made some remarks on 

 its affinities. The short-footed Ungulates or Proboscidia, are re- 

 presented b}' two very different families in the Eocene formations 

 of Xorth America, the Eobasiliidse and Bathmodontidse. The first 

 embraces four known genera, as follows: — 



1. Xasal bones with flat horizontal horn-cores overhanging their 

 apex. 



Cervical vertebrae short ; malar bone much reduced in front. 



Loxolojjhodon. 



2. Xasal bones with small tuberosities. 



Cervical vertebrte short. Eohasileiis. 



Cervical vertebrae longer; the malar bone reaching maxillar}^ 

 face. Uintatherium. 



B. Xasal bones without the anterior horn-cores. 



Cervicals ? Megaceratops. 



Of the above genera there are five well-determined species, viz.: 

 L. cornidua, Cope; E. pressicornis, Cope; U. robust um, Leidy; 

 U. lacustre, Marsh ; and 31. coloradoensis, Leidy. E. furcatus, 

 Cope, and U. mirabile, Marsli, would, perhaps, have to be added. 



There are two genera of Bathmodontidse, as follows: — 



One posterior molar with two transverse crests. Bathmodon. 



Three posterior cross-crested molars. Metalophodon.

DESCEIPTIONS OF MEXICAN ICHNEUM0NID5:. 

 BY E. T. CRESSON. 



Most of the species described and enumerated in this paper 

 were collected by Prof. F. Sumichrast in the environs of Orizaba 

 and Cordova, and b^^him presented to the American Entomological 

 Societ}-, in whose collection the types are to be found. To the 

 late Dr. Charles Sartorius the Societ}- is also indebted for luanj' 

 new and interesting species collected b}' him in the neighborhood 

 of Mirador. 



The collection is exceedingl}' rich in species, especially of the 

 subfamilies Ichneumonides, Cryptides, Ophionides, and Pimp- 

 lides ; and those belonging to the genera Ichneumon and Mesoa- 

 tenus are very numerous and variable in form, structure, etc. 

 Many of the species are handsome in ornamentation and brilliant 

 iu color. 



Genus ICHNEUMON, Linn. 



Subgenus Patroclls. 



Tliis subgenus is at once distinguished from that of Ichneumon 

 by the ungues being pectinate. The form is rather slender ; the 

 head flat, triangular when viewed in front; the cheeks not at all 

 prominent; the antennre long and slender, and not involute in 9, 

 and the scutellum convex or subconvex; ovipositor scarcelj- or 

 not at all exserted. Onh' three species are known to me, and may 

 be separated as follows : — 



Body entirely blue-black 1. nigroc^ruleus. 



Body yellow, much marked above with black 2. lectus. 



Body Louey-yellow, abdomen fasciate with black 3. toltecus. 



1. Patroclus nigrocaerulens, n. sp. 



9. — Blue-black; thorax deep blue, abdomen tinged with green- 

 ish in certain lights ; antenujE black, with a broad, 3ellowish- 

 white annulus; wings violaceus-black ; anterior tibife yellowish 

 in front. Tiiorax densel}' and strongly punctured ; metathorax 

 densel}' rugulose, the elevated lines not well-defined; wings ample, 

 areolet 5-angular ; legs slender; abdomen elongate, convex, finely 

 and closely punctured ; first segment dilated at tip, which is finely

Subgenus Ichneumon. 



In this subgenus are included a large number of species varj'- 

 ing greatly in form, but with such intermediation that no line to 

 divide them even into subgenera can be drawn. The head in 

 some species is large, broad, and buccate, but is graduallj^ re- 

 duced to a small, flat, triangular form. The antennae vary from 

 robust, involute (9), with very short, almost moniliform, joints, 

 to a ver^' slender form, not at all involute (9), with elongate 

 joints, and sometimes slightly dilated near the apex, as in Jop2^a. 

 The scutellum varies from being perfectly flat, through convex, 

 conical, to spinose, and even bispinose, with all intermediate 

 grades. So also with the metathorax, which varies from being 

 rounded, with no appearance of lateral protuberances, to truncate 

 behind, with long and acute lateral spines. The species having 

 the last character, together with a slender form, were formerly 

 referred to Hoplismenus ; but since the examination of so many 

 intermediate forms, it is quite impossible to draw a dividing line 

 between it and Ichneumon; therefore, no attempt is made here 

 to divide the species into subgenera. 



The following diagnostic table will assist in determining the 

 species : — 



Scutellum flat, subconvex, or convex: 

 Body entirely honey-yellow or ferruginous : 

 Large ; scutellum flat above, lateral margin carinate, sides abrupt ; 

 metathorax without spines ; antennjE black, with white au-

CATALOGUE OF THE EECENT SPECIES OF THE CLASS ERACHIOPODA 



BY W. H. DALL, V. S. COAST SURVEY. 



The following catalogue contains all the species known in a 

 recent state up to the date of writing. The sj-nonymy does not 

 profess to be complete, but onl}' sufficiently so to indicate the 

 history of each species approximate)}', with a reference whenever 

 possible to at least one good figure. 



It is probable that some of the species, especially of the genera 

 Lingula and Discinisca, may be reduced to the rank of s3'non3-ms 

 by a careful comparison of t3'pes. I have thought it best to leave 

 this work, however, to some one who may have the opportunity of 

 comparing the specimens themselves. I feel confident, also, that 

 the number of species of K7-ai(ssi7ia has been exaggerated. With 

 regard to the other groujDS, the}' appear to have been sufficiently 

 reduced, and the species here enumerated appear to be well de- 

 fined. Most of them I have been able to examine critically. 



While deprecating the multiplication of specific names on the 

 one hand, on the other the practice, miscalled conservatism, which 

 leads to the confounding of allied but distinct forms, from care- 

 lessness in comparison or the want of material for critical exami- 

 nation, cannot be too strongly condemned. Such a course leads 

 to the destruction of that critical exactness which is the basis of 

 all science, and only furthers the convenience of the careless or 

 indolent investigator, at the sacrifice of accuracy, and the great 

 increase of labor for the more careful and painstaking student. 



Those who may be led to examine this catalogue carefully will 

 trace the evil effect of both courses in the synonymy of many of 

 the species, and, while absolute accuracy seems unattainable, I 

 may be permitted to hope that herein at least a step has been 

 made in that direction. Great care has been taken with the locali- 

 ties attributed to the several species, and they are believed to be, 

 in the main, correct. 



I am under obligations to Mr. George W. Tryon, Jr., for assist- 

 ance in completing the synonymy.

March 4. 

 Mr. Yaux, Vice-President, in the chair. 

 Twentj'-six members present. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan exhibited a flower of Bletia Tankervillia 

 {Phaiua grandifiora of some authors), in which the dorsal sepal 

 (or, as some authors contend, petal), had united with the column, 

 and had been much retarded in its development accordingly. 

 He said that he had several dozen of flowers produced in this 

 way this winter, all however confined to separate spikes from 

 those which bore the perfect flowers. In some cases flowers were 

 produced which had two of the exterior petals united together 

 perfectly, in which case they formed a hood over the apex of the 

 column. As changes of a similar cliaracter were not uncommon 

 in Orchidaceous plants, it was likely this form of changed struc- 

 ture had been seen before, though not falling within his own 

 observation. It was usual to pass over these appearances as 

 " monstrosities," but in truth the whole Orchid structure was 

 little less than a monstrosit3^ If we except the character of the 

 position of the seeds in the capsule, there was little to divide an 

 Orchid from an Iris, bej^ond the power of combining organs 

 which are free in the Iris — the power which produced the " mon- 

 strosity" we see. The stamens were entirely coherent with the 

 pistil in Orchidaceous plants, and free in the Iridaceous. He 

 had seen in a " monstrous" Habenaria the lip so transformed, 

 that the whole flower had as regular an appearance as a Sisyrin- 

 chium in the Iridacese. 



He did not think as much had been made out of the changes 

 of structure in Orchids in the study of evolution, as miglit be, 

 in consequence of the impression that these abnormal forms, 

 as they were termed, were monstrosities, or the results of culti- 

 vation. There had been already on record accounts of changes 

 in wild Orchids more remarkable than many much dwelt on b^^ 

 many modern writers on development. Sir Richard Schomburg 

 described and figured forty years ago, in the Linnoean Transactions 

 (15th vol.), three distinct genera — Catasetum, Machranthus, and 

 Myanthus — all growing out of one plant in Demerara; and seed 

 which he took from one of these, and scattered on a piece of 

 rotten wood, produced plants with flowers of one of the otlier 

 genera. All these facts showed that the power of cohesion of one 

 organ with another was one of the leading forces at work in 

 forming the Orchidaceous structure ; and, as we saw in the speci- 

 men exhibited to-night, this power could be readily obstructed, 

 so as to produce many variations, it could hardly be said that 

 genera were founded on any absolute law.

He further remarked, that, iu examining closelj" the flowers of 

 Bletia Tankervillia early in the morning, he found on the outside, 

 at the base of the three exterior petals, a liquid exudation from a 

 small gland. It was highh' probable that these glands were rudi- 

 mentary spurs, and that, if the course of nutrition which sus- 

 tained the cohering power of an Orchid could in trny way be 

 diverted before the final direction of form, each of these outer 

 petals might take on some of the labellate character with its at- 

 tendant spur, which gave such a peculiar appearance to so many 

 Orchidaceous plants.

 Description of a new^ variety of Buteo. By Bernard A. Hoopes 



Remarks on the Occurrence of an Extinct Hog in America. — 

 Prof Leidy exhibited the fragment of a lower jaw of a pig which 

 Prof. Hayden had picked up, together with many remains of ex- 

 tinct mammals, in the pliocene sands of the Niobrara River, 

 Nebraska. The specimen contains the temporary molars, and 

 does not differ auatomicall}^ from the corresponding part of the 

 domestic pig. It is heavier than usual, and appears to have un- 

 dergone some alteration, perhaps b}' the partial replacement of a 

 portion of its bone cartilage by mineral matter. The specimen 

 he A'iewed as of recent character, and not as a true indigenous 

 fossil. Prof L. remarked that he had never seen any remains of 

 the hog which he could confidently view as true American fossils. 

 Rafinesque, DeBlainville, Holmes, and Emmons had reported and 

 represented specimens as American fossils, but he doubted their 

 character as such. He had seen the specimens of Emmons, re- 

 puted to be from the miocene of N. Carolina, and those of Holmes, 

 from the shores of the Ashley River, S. C., and felt convinced 

 they were of recent date. Prof. Cope has recently reported the 

 discovery of the tooth of a hog in New Jersey, which he has re- 

 ferred to an extinct species with the name of Sus vagrans. He 

 had not seen the specimen, but was inclined to suspect it would 

 turn out to belong to the same category as the former ones. 



Prof Cope mentioned that Prof W. C. Kerr, State G-eologist 

 of North Carolina, had suljmitted to his examination an entire 

 cranium with other bones of a hog said to have been taken from 

 the Miocene marl of Wilson Count^^, North Carolina, at a depth 

 of ten feet from its surface, or sixteen feet from the surface of the 

 ground. The skull was partiallj^, at least, filled with this matrix. 

 The bone was not silicified, and though there were but two pre- 

 maxillary teeth, and the canines were small, he thought that it 

 belonged to a sow Sus scropha. 



Prof Cope further stated that Dr. Hayden handed to him for 

 determination some bones on a fragment of the Green River shale 

 of the Eocene of Wj'oming. They indicated a species of Anou- 

 rous Batrachian, but, as the indiAaduals were not fully developed, 

 he was not prepared to identify the genus. The}"- constituted the

first indication of this order in time; those previously kno^-n from 

 Europe and India being all of Miocene age.

Odostomia yitkea, Garr., pi. 3, fig. 52. 



Shell elongate, subulate, thin, vitreous, smooth, shining, pellucid, 

 white ; spire verj' long, regularlj- tapering from the body whorl, 

 apex acute, base slightlj- produced, whorls 11, nearly plain; last 

 one rounded, faintly striated by lines of growth ; suture linear 

 and rather widely margined beneath ; aperture, ovate, acutely 

 angular above, with revolving tliin lamellffi deep in the throat, 

 which, as seen through the transparent shell appear like revolving 

 lines; peristome thin, straight, slightly expanded at the base; 

 columella concave, callous, slightly reflexed, forming a small um- 

 bilical fissure, and the spiral fold stout ; parietal region thinly cal- 

 lous.

Animal oblong, smooth, soft, convex on the dorsal region, and 

 the bod}- deep. The mantle is narrow, rounded and somewhat di- 

 lated in front, acutely rounded posteriorly, margins thin and 

 slightly gashed. The dorsal tentacles, which issue from simple 

 cavities, are rather distant from each other, oblong, sub-trigonal 

 in shape, pointed and very finely' lamellated. The branchial star 

 is rather lai'ge, wider than the mantle, and is composed of twenty- 

 four plumes which are more or less forked. Anal tube prominent. 

 Labial appendages small and conical. The large foot is elongate, 

 and projects far behind the mantle. 



Color creamy-white, the mantle and foot margined with violet, 

 and, together with the sides of the body, decorated with a few small, 

 scattered, roundish, deep black ocelli i, encircled with opaque white 

 rings which are shaded off with light umber. The dorsal tentacles 

 are light umber, graduall}' passing into violet aboA'C, and the la- 

 mellae, together with an anterior and posterior vertical line, white. 

 The branchial plumes are pale tawnj^ flesh, edged with light uraber, 

 and the tips violet.

Male. — Bill strong, wide at the base, much curved, blue, darker 

 towards the tip, edges of the upper mandible lobed. Cere blue and 

 large. Xostrils large and roundisli. Entire head and nape pure 

 white, with the exception of a few feathers on eacli side of the 

 forehead at the base of the upper mandible, which are tipped with 

 dark-brown. Lores white, covered with bristly hairs, a faint super- 

 ciliary line of an ochreous tint extends be3^ond the eyes. 



Cheeks white, with several lines of feathers, narrowly- tipped 

 with dark-brown, extending down the sides of the neck and a 

 short distance under the wings. Back brown, largely spotted with 

 white, which is the prevailing color of the base of the feathers, 

 some of them are edged with yellowish-brown ; many of the 

 feathers on the upper part of the back are arrow-shaped, or 

 pointed, faintly edged with white. 



Wings long and wide, of the prevailing color of the back, with 

 lighter tints on the shoulders ; the white of the under side of the 

 wings extending over the edges. 



Primaries dark, first quill shortest, third, fourth, and fifth nearly 

 of a size (fourth rather the longest), of an ashy tint on the outer

 tected beneath by ten large transverse scales. Toes dark lead- 

 color, large. Claws black, and strong. 



The female does not differ much from the male in the general 

 appearance of the plumage, is considerabl}' larger, as usual with 

 tlie birds of prey. The back is rather lighter brown, the white 

 spots larger. 



Tail darker, more of an umber tint on the middle feathers, which 

 are edged and tipped with white. The forehead is white, but the 

 feathers, of the head and neck are tipped with small lanceolate 

 spots of brown. Under parts entirely white, with fewer spots on 

 the flanks than themale, the tarsi and feet more robust, and of a 

 similar color. 



Dimensions. — Male, total length 20h inches, tail 9 inches. Female, total 

 length 224 inches, tail 9i inches. 



The above description is made from two specimens, male and 

 female, collected in Winnebago County, Iowa, by Mr. John Krider 

 of Philadelphia, in September, 1872, and carefull}' prepared bj' 

 that gentleman. 



He mentioned having seen several others, and described them 

 as having the habits and manner of flight common to the buzzard 

 family, and, from their being noticed in the autumn, were possibly 

 migrating from more northern breeding-grounds. During a pre- 

 vious visit to the same localit}', in 1871, he saw a specimen 

 evidenth" similar to tliese, but was unable to secure it. Being 

 informed b^' residents of the country that the appearance of a 

 '• white hawk" there was not an unusual occurrence, he felt con- 

 fident of ultimately procuring one, and has not been disappointed. 



Being convinced that it is undescribed, I have named it in 

 honor of the veteran naturalist to whom we are indebted for the 

 discovery.

ON THE LINGUAL DENTITION AND JAW OF CERTAIN TERRESTRIAL 

 PULMONATA FROM THE UNITED STATES, WITH REMARKS ON THEIR 

 SYSTEMATIC VALUE. 



BY THOMAS BLAND AND W. G. BINNEY. 



The character of the jaw and lingual dentition of tlie A'arious 

 genera and subgenera of our land shells is now so well known, 

 and apparentl}^ so constant, that we have not thought it necessary 

 to give full descriptions in each case. We simply refer to a pub- 

 lished description or figure under each genus or subgenus, unless 

 some unusual feature has been observed. The number of ribs 

 upon the jaw is given approximatel}' when there is a difficulty in 

 deciding whether certain stages of thickening of the material of 

 the jaw shall be counted as rudimentary ribs or not. 



Macroctclis Duranti, Xewcoml). 



Los Angeles, California, Mr. Henry Hemphill. 



On examining the lingual membrane, we find it does not agree 

 with that of Hyalina or Zonites, but with that of Ilacrocyclis 

 Vancouver ensis^ sportella and concava. The species must there- 

 fore be recognized as a Macrocyclifi. 



The jaw was injured in extraction and imperfectly examined. 

 It seems, however, to have the usual characteristics of the genus.

Systema sexuale simplex ;' desuut sagitta, bursa, flagellum, et vesica 

 multifida. Orificium ut iu Helice posituni. 



Externall}', the animal resembles that of Helix. It is bluish- 

 slate colored. 



We have alread}' described and figured the lingual dentition 

 (see Am. Journ. Conch., YII. 190, pi. xvii. fig. .3, 4). The jaw 

 is long, low, slightly arcuate; ends blunt; anterior surface with 

 about sixteen stout, separated ribs, scalloping either margin. 

 The jaw is lower, less arcuate and longer than in Arionla. Its 

 ribs resemble those of that subgenus in projecting far bej-ond and 

 scalloping the margins of the jaw, but thej' are much more 

 numerous. 



This description applies only to the more perfect form of the 

 jaw (fig. 1 of our plate), noticed onh' in one individual. In several 

 other individuals the ribs on the jaw were much more narrow and 

 less projecting at the upper and lower margins. There is more 

 difierence between these than is usually found in different indivi- 

 duals of the same species.

 propose to review our work, to see how nearly our observations 

 agree with the generic descriptions published b}- Albers and von 

 Martens for the various genera. We give below a list of our 

 descriptions published previous to 1873 in other works than the

From the observations we have catalogued above, it appears that 

 the jaw cannot be depended upon as a generic character in the 

 genus Bulimus, SiS constituted in the second edition of DieHeliceen. 

 We have found it stronglj'^ ribbed, with ribs as described below in 

 Bulimulus, ribless, and ribless with a decided median projection 

 to its cutting edge. In Limicolaria the jaw is described with ribs, 

 we find it ribless in one species. In Bulimulus, von Martens 

 describes the jaw as composite. We have shown it to be in one 

 single piece, though divided by delicate ribs into numerous plate- 

 like sections. The jaw is also very thin and transparent. This 

 form of jaw seems constant in Bulimulus. It is also found in 

 Cylindrella, 3Iacroceranius, Amphibulima, Gseotis, and even in 

 Helix {H. turhiniformis). The tendency to an upper^ triangular 

 median plate is more or less seen in this form of jaw — its greatest 

 development being in Cylindrella. 



In the genus Helix as constituted by von Martens, the jaw is 

 said to be ribbed, but we have found every variety of jaw except 

 that with an upper additional plate, and that with free imbricated 

 plates as in Orthalicus. We believe, however, that the form of 

 jaw is constant in all the species of each section or subgenus of 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 253 



Helix. Thus we have found the jaw alike in all the species we 

 have examined of Patula. So of Sagda, Polygyra, Mesodon, 

 Arionta, Stenotrema, Triodopsis^ Plagioptycha, Polymita^ Dentel- 

 laria. 



It appears to us, therefore, that we may hope to find a reliable 

 generic character in the jaw, when the present subgenera, or some 

 of them at least, are recognized as distinct genera. On account 

 of the gradations in the ribs and median projection, we have else- 

 where' suggested that for the purpose of grouping the genera into 

 subfamilies, we may depend only upon the following distinctions 

 in the jaw. 



(a.) Jaw in one piece. 



(6.) Jaw in separated, imbricated pieces. 



(c.) Jaw in one piece with an upper accessory plate. 



As regards the lingual dentition, it appears that the distinction, 

 as far as the central and lateral teeth are concerned, is but slight 

 between the various families and genera. The marginal teeth, 

 however, give us two very distinct types, the aculeate and quadrate. 



The former is found either unaccompanied by a jaw, or by its 

 simplest form. Up to this date no instance is on record of aculeate 

 marginal teeth together with a jaw complicated by anterior ribs, 

 free imbricated plates, or an upper accessory plate. The presence 

 of aculeate marginal teeth is usual!}' (not always) indicated by a 

 smooth, shining shell, with acute peristome. The shell, however, 

 is not always reliable as an indicator of the form of marginal teeth, 

 for we have shown the rough shells of several Mauritius species 

 to have a lingual membrane with aculeate marginal teeth. It 

 appears, therefore, that the shell alone will not indicate the generic 

 position of some species. 



The quadrate marginal teeth are accompanied b}- various forms 

 of jaw. They are usuall}- constant in shape in the various genera. 

 Sometimes, however, we have met with unexpected variation — 

 such as in 3Iacroceramus Gossei, Helix muscarum, and a group 

 of Bulimulus represented by B. lalicinctus. 



The form of jaw with free, imbricated plates seems (excepting 

 in Punctxim) constantlj' accompanied by a peculiar form of quadrate 

 teeth, as in Orthalicus and Liguiis. To our surprise, however, 

 we have detected a somewhat similar form of teeth in Gaeotis, 



' Ann. Lye. N. H. of X. Y., X. 163. 




254 PROOEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



whose jaw is like that of Bulimiilus.^ It seems, therefore, that 

 the lingual dentition is less reliable as a generic character than 

 the jaw, at least in eases where the aculeate marginal teeth are 

 absent. 



Finall}^, we are convinced that most satisfactory results will 

 follow the patient investigation of the jaw and lingual dentition 

 of the Geophila. i^lthough we have in many cases proved the 

 distinctions, which have been based on them, to be unreliable, we 

 believe that a further accumulation of facts will lay the foundation 

 of a natural and generall}'^ acceptable classification.

 page 245. The names of the organs are the same as used by Dr. 

 Leidy in the plates of Yol. I. of Dr. Binney's Terrestrial Air- 

 breathing Mollusks of the United States. 



We failed to detect any accessory gland of the epididj^mis. The 

 epididymis is very long, convoluted in the lower half of its length, 

 straight above. It runs free for a long distance outside the mem- 

 brane which covers the oviduct, Taefore entering into the liver, 

 where it joins the testicle. The latter is imbedded in the liver, 

 near its upper extremity. It is composed of several, apparently 

 six, separated fasciculi of blind tubes. The vas deferens enters 

 the penis about its middle, not at its end. The penis is small, 

 cjdindrical. There is no trace of lobuli in the ovary, but its under, 

 concave surface is reticulated. The genital bladder is oval, its 

 duct is long, free only for a short distance, then attached to the 

 oviduct the whole length of the latter ; at its base it becomes 

 again free, and enters tlie vagina below the terminus of the oviduct. 

 At about the same point, the vagina receives the mouth of a long, 

 broad, rounded organ, (12 of fig. 3). This organ is hollow. Its 

 use is unknown to ns, it maj^ be a dart sac, or a prostate gland. 



1 We are about publishing this in the Ann. N. Y. Lye. of N. H., 1873, 

 X. 251, pi. xi. fig. 5. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 255 



The vagina is very long, the penis enters it at its lower ex- 

 tremity near the exterior opening of the genitalia. 



For the sake of comparison, we have also given figures of the 

 genitalia of two other Pacific subgenera, Arionta and Aglaja. 

 In nelix Toivnsendiana, Lea (Ario7ita), see plate I. fig. 4, we 

 detected the accessory gland of the epididymis (3), composed of 

 several acini of different sizes. The genital bladder is lengthened 

 oval (9), and differs greatly from that of Helix Newherryana in 

 having a very short, stout duct. At the opening of the penis there 

 is a decided enlargement, perhaps of the nature of a prepuce, or 

 prostate. The vas deferens enters the penis below its apex. 

 The retractor muscle is at the apex of the penis. There seems 

 no accessory organ, the genitalia being reduced to their simplest 

 type. 



Of Aglaia we have examined two species, H. fidelis^ Grra3', and 

 H. infumata, Gould. The genitalia of these are almost exactly 

 similar. In neither have we detected any accessory gland to the 

 epididj-mis. In both the penis is extended into a decided fla- 

 gellum (15). The vas deferens (7) enters below the flagellate ex- 

 tension (15). The retractor muscle (6) is attached on the oppo- 

 site side and still lower down. There is a well-marked prepuce 

 (12). Opposite the entrance of the penis on the other side of the 

 vagina, which is here considerably swollen, is a small sac-like 

 organ (14), ending in a smoothly rounded cul-de-sac, of what use 

 in the economy of the animal is unknown to us, unless it be a " 

 rudimentary dart sac. There was no appearance, however, of a 

 dart within it. Just above this organ opens the stout duct of 

 another organ (13), cylindrical, bluntly pointed, hollow, of a 

 reticulated appearance. There is a contraction where this organ 

 joins its duct, which is of about the same size. The two together 

 are about as long as the penis with its flagellum, and stoutei-. No 

 dart was noticed within this organ. It is, no doubt, a form of 

 vaginal prostate, as described by Moquin Tandon. The genital 

 bladder (9) is globular. Its duct is long, free in the upper half 

 of its course. The oviduct, ovarj', genital bladder, testicle, etc., 

 of H. infumata, fig. 2, are not figured by us. They are as in H. 

 Jidelis, fig. 5, excepting the testicle, which is as in H. Newher- 

 ryana.

 " On the Affinities of the Sirenians." By Theo. Gill. 



Dr. Leidt presented an interesting specimen of bituminous 

 coal from the mines of the Westmoreland Coal Company, West- 

 moreland County, Pennsylvania. This specimen is a gift to the 

 museum, from George C. Hewett, Esq., Mining Engineer, who 

 furnishes the following details : The seam from which the speci- 

 men is taken is noted for its regulai'itj' and freedom from faults. 

 Occasional cracks, however, occur sometimes several hundred feet 

 in length. In these cracks incrustations of iron p3-rites are found 

 in various forms, of which an unusual one is shown in the present 

 specimen, viz., in the form of stalactical jjrolongations. The 

 remaining portions of the vein consist of remarkably pure coal 

 especially suited for the manufacture of illuminating gas. 



Prof. Leidy remarked that the rat presented this evening by 

 Mr. L. Fussel was a specimen of the Black Eat, or Mus rattus, 

 which had been caught on board a ship in the vicinity of the city. 

 This rat is exceedingly^ rare, but is said to have once been com- 

 mon enough, and is also said to have been nearly exterminated 

 by the common brown or Norway Rat. 



Prof. Leidy also exhibited a specimen of iron ore, recently 

 sent to him by Dr. George W. Lawrence, of Hot Springs, Ark. It 

 was the mineral Dufreynite, and was found in Polk Co., Ark.

Dr. LeConte announced the death, at Davidsburg, York Co., 

 Pa., on the 10th March, of Friedrich Ernest Melsheimer, M.D., a 

 correspondent of the Academy', aged nearlj- ninety-one years. He 

 inherited great taste for entomology from his father, E. F. Mels- 

 heimer, a clergyman, who cultivated natural science with much 

 success, and not only was a highly esteemed correspondent of 

 Knoch and other European entomologists of the end of the past 

 and beginning of the present century, but an active collaborator 




258 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



with Say, tlie founder of descriptive entomology in tlie United 

 States. 



Dr. Melsheimer tlms inheriting the tastes and the collection of 

 his father, lias preserved, for later investigators, the only authen- 

 tic types of many of Mr. Say's species ; and has also contributed 

 no small proportion of the descriptions of Coleoi)tera, which ap- 

 peared up to Februar}', 1847. His memoirs on this subjoct, con- 

 taining notes and descriptions of about four hundred and fifty- 

 seven species, were printed in the 2d and 3d vols, of the proceed- 

 ings of this Academy. 



Entomology also owes to him the catalogue of the described 

 Coleoptera of the United States, which, after revision b^' Prof. S. 

 S. Haldeman and myself, was published by the Smithsonian Insti- 

 tution in 1853. It was the first work of bibliographical import- 

 ance in the modern history of that branch of science, and gave a 

 powerful impetus to its development in the United States, and 

 has greatl\' diminished the labor of those who have continued the 

 study of that department. 



Living an isolated life on his farm, remote from usual lines of 

 travel, dependent almost entirely on letters for the sympathy and 

 counsel of his fellow students, separated from libraries containing 

 the results of modern research, and therefore dependent on the 

 traditional knowledge received from Europe, which constituted 

 in fact most of the intellectual capital of the founders of natural 

 history in the United States, Dr. Melsheimer must be considered 

 as a ver}' remarkable instance of one who, with very limited 

 opportunities, has worked honestly, to the extent of his abilities, 

 to develop the powers of usefulness which were given him. 



Modest, unpretending, aflfectionate to his family, devoted to his 

 friends, industrious to the limit of human usefulness, his death, 

 at such an advanced age, can only leave, with those who have 

 enjo3'ed his acquaintance, a satisfaction that they have known so 

 good a representative of the purer qualities of humanity. 



The following letter, on the introduction of the California 

 Salmon, was read by Prof. Cope : — 



Harrisburg, Pa., March 11, 1878. 



My Dear Sir: Supposing 3-ou might feel some interest in the 

 matter, I propose to give you a short account of the introduction 

 of the California Salmon, which I hope it will be m}^ good fortune 

 to be able years hence to say I effected on the third of this present 

 month. 



Professor Baird, U. S. Com. of Fisheries, employed last summer 

 Mr. Livingston Stone, of Rhode Island, to procure the spawn of 

 some California Salmon, They have been called Sacramento 

 Salmon ; and I believe the spawn were obtained from that stream 

 or one of its branches. 



Dr. Slack obtained just sixty-nine hundred young; they thrived 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 259 



and got on vei\y well in his preserves till about the 18th of Febru- 

 ary, when he found that they could not be preserved in the small 

 space at his disposal for them and they began to die from confine- 

 ment. 



I had previously- arranged with Mr. Baird that these fish should 

 be deposited in the Susquehanna — a gift from the Government to 

 Pennsylvania — so Dr. Slack said I must get ready as soon as 

 possible, as he feared the mortality amongst them might spread. 

 The weather was so warm that we could not move them nntil the 

 3d inst. as stated — by which time the loss had reached to one 

 hundred and fifty individuals. They were transported across 

 from New Jersey, about seven miles from Easton, to Harrisburg 

 on the day named, and I had them placed in the water in an air 

 hole in the ice close to the shore at Harrisburg — about one hun- 

 dred died on the passage — about fifty were much weakened bj'^the 

 journe}' l)ut recovered in a few minutes after reaching the new 

 water. But the balance, the healtliy ones, immediatel}' made for 

 the current, and disappeared under the ice with as much energy 

 as if they were native to our Susquehanna. 



The water, when they entered, was 36° Fahr. at the time, but 

 the river l)ottom is full of springs at which they could warm them- 

 selves. Had I the least idea that there was no description of 

 them, I should have noted their peculiarities in my unscientific 

 wa3' more particularly, but as it is the above is the best descrip- 

 tion I can give 3'ou of them. Dr. Slack, I believe, fed them after 

 they had parted witii their 3^olk sack ; but I concluded, from my 

 own judgment, that the best tiling I could do was to trust tliem to 

 the magnificent Susquehanna. The energy with which the healthy 

 ones put out leads me to hope that they will live if not devoured 

 by enemies ; but should they die we can repeat the experiment 

 with a larger quantity hereafter.

 directed attention to some fossils, which he had borrowed, through 




260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Prof. E. 0. Hove}', from the cabinet of Wabash College, Craw- 

 fordsville, Indiana. They were part of a collection obtained by 

 Dr. Lorenzo G. Yates from a quarternary deposit of California. 

 One of the specimens is the right ramus of the lower jaw of a 

 wolf, probably of the Canis indianensis, previously indicated from 

 a specimen found on the banks of the Ohio, Indiana. 



A second specimen consists of the fore part of a maxillary bone, 

 with the second prenular, and the canine alveolus, of a tiger as 

 large as the largest living Bengal tiger. It probabl}^ indicates a 

 species different from those previously noticed, and might be 

 named Felis imperialis. 



Several specimens consist of upper molar teeth, which ar esup- 

 posed to pertain to Bison latifrons. 



The remaining and most interesting specimens consist of an 

 upper molar and a complete lower molar series of a lama as large 

 as the existing camel. Remains of a still larger species from 

 California have been previously indicated under the name of Au- 

 chenia californica. The present specimens were referred to a 

 species with the name Auchenia hesterna. Prof. Owen has de- 

 scribed some remains of an equally large lama from Mexico, which 

 he refers to an allied genus with the name of Palauchenia magna, 

 and which perhaps ma}' be the same as the Auchenia hesterna. 

 An inspection of Prof. Owen's figures of a series of molar teeth 

 leads to the suspicion that he has inadvertently mistaken the 

 upper series for the lower ones, and has thus been led to refer 

 them to a genus different from Auchenia.

Fungus Parasite on a Mouse — Prof. Leidy exhibited a mouse 

 with several whitish masses adherent to the ears, side of the face, 

 and nose. The mouse had been caught in the children's depart- 

 ment of Blockley Hospital, and was submitted to his exami- 

 nation by one of the attending physicians, Dr. James B. Walker, 

 who had informed him that he had observed a number of mice in 

 the same condition. Dr. Walker had previously informed him of 

 the curious affection of the mice, and it was at his suggestion that 

 the present specimen was caught for examination. The white 

 matter examined beneath the microscope proved to be composed 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 261 



of spoi'ular bodies, single, double, or in short chains of a dozen or 

 more. They measure about the -^l^ of a line in diameter. The 

 fungus is a Torula or Oidium, and resembles that found in Aptha. 

 Perhaps the disease in the mice is the result of feeding upon arti- 

 cles imbued with adherent portions of apthous matter from the 

 mouths of children, and perhaps also the latter ma}' become af- 

 fected from diseased mice contaminating food or drink used by 

 the children. 



Dr. LeConte remarked that he had found in his father's house 

 in New York, several 3'ears ago, a mouse exhibiting the same 

 fungoid disease, and in the fungi were found specimens of a 

 coleopterous insect of the genus Lathridius. The doctor also 

 remarked that in a few days a cutaneous eruption appeared on his 

 own person, which seemed to have been derived from the fungoid 

 disease of the mouse.

2G2 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



ON THE AFFINITIES OF THE SIRENIANS, 

 BY THEODORE GILL, M.D., PH.D. 



There exist, among the placental mammals, several well-defined 

 groups combined together and differentiated from all others by 

 the common character of atroph}^, or entire want, of the posterior 

 members as well as pelvis, a pisciform shape, and adaptation for 

 habitual life in the water. These common co-ordinated characters 

 have been supposed by most zoologists to indicate close affinity. 

 A few, however, have considered them to be an insufficient index, 

 and recognizing that one of these groups was more isolated than 

 the others, and its members provided with a less abnormal skull, 

 and with a dentition and intestinal canal adapted for a vegetable 

 regimen, have approximated that group to the Pachyderm Ungu- 

 lates. Such zoologists seem insensibly to have been influenced 

 more especially by teleological considerations (adaptation for vege- 

 table food and complexity of the intestinal tract), and size. 

 Appreciating the vague (and very vague) similarit}' between the 

 groups in question (the Sirenians) and the hoofed mammals, 

 coincident with a comparatively' large size (and thus contrasting 

 with the other herbivorous mammals), and further struck with 

 the agreement of the Sirenians with the hoofed mammals (Pach}'- 

 derms) distinguished by the negative character of want of a 

 compound stomach, they have combined the two into one order. 

 Unwilling, however, to confess or even admit to self, the influence 

 of such considerations, the d priori conclusion reached has been 

 attempted to be substantiated by a selection of characters sup- 

 posed to be common to forms of the two groups, while no exclu- 

 sive diagnosis has been framed for the common group. But so 

 strong has been the prepossession, in favor of the view of the 

 affinities of the group in question, that it permeates and is felt in 

 sj'stems where it is not avowed, and this influence is evident in 

 works of the latest writers. 



Probability of Common Origin. 



It is far more credible, in the opinion of the author, that the 

 ordinary Cetaceans and the Sirenians are derivatives from a 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 263 



common original stock — a generalized gyrencephalic t3'pe — whose 

 form had already' been modified for continued aquatic life by the 

 reduction or atroph}^ of the hinder members, and that the existing 

 orders represent the extreme specialization in diverse directions 

 from such a common tj'pe, than that the two forms have inde- 

 pendently diverged from two ambulatorial types. Even admit- 

 ting the utmost differences that have been urged between the two 

 forms, and the respective affinities of each to other forms, all such 

 are still so indisputably related, inteT se, as alone to suggest 

 suspicions and doubts as to independent origin. Furthermore, 

 it would appear more probable that such divergence had com- 

 menced from a type whose toes were separated and spreading, 

 than from one whose digits and corneous appendage had already 

 become specialized as hoofs ; the difficulties, indeed, incident to 

 the view of the development from a hoofed mammal of a mutilate 

 form, are so great and obvious that reasons stronger than any 

 yet given will doubtless be required before a general belief in 

 such development, or in the very intimate affinity of the Sireuians 

 and Pachyderms, prevails. 



It must of course be granted that the pisciform mammals are 

 the derivatives from quadrupedal types, for the evidence as to 

 the line of descent from the lowest quadrupedal mammal to the 

 higher, is unassailable; therefore, the terms embryonic^ or syu- 

 thetic are inapplicable to the pisciform mammals ; on the contrary, 

 those mammals must be considered as in the highest degree de- 

 veloped and specialized types, and if the extent of specialization 

 in any direction were a true test of rank, their claims to the first 

 rank would be indisputable. 



Character of Progenitor. 



As to the common progenitor of the Sirenians and Cetaceans, 

 the evidence is by no means as clear as would be desirable. We 

 have, in the Pinnipedia, a type that has been, in a high degree 

 (compared with ordinar}^ quadrupeds), specialized for aquatic life. 

 The characters common to that t^'pe and the Fissipede carnivores, 



' Prof. Agassiz has been able to see in the mutilate mammals "embry- 

 onic" types, cousideriug the Cetaceans to be "embryonic" caruivores, and 

 the Sirenians to be genuine "embryonic" types of Pachyderms. See Proc. 

 Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., iii. p. 209, 1850. 




264 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



and especially such non-adaptive characters as the union of the 

 scaphoid and lunar bones, indicate their communit}- of origin, 

 and point to the derivation of Pinnipedias from a specialized car- 

 nivorous stock. The tendencies of the specialization in the Pin- 

 nipedia, as the great reduction in size of the milk teeth, the 

 decreasing differentiation of the other teeth, and the modifications 

 of the form, are towards the Cete ; the extinct Zeuglodonts, and 

 especially the Basilosaiiridae, even indicate the possibility, if not 

 probabilit}^, of the derivation of the Cete from a Pinniped avus. 

 At the most, however, it can only be claimed that no quadrupedal 

 type now exists, or has left its remains, so far as is yet known, 

 which so nearly fulfils the conditions of intervention between 

 ordinar}'- quadrupeds and mutilates as the Pinnipedia. It is 

 possible, however, that the resemblances in question may be 

 adaptive, and it must not be forgotten that similar tendencies, 

 but in a verj^ minor degree, are exhibited by a specialized lutrine 

 type (Enhydris, or sea otter). A careful comparative study of 

 the detailed anatomy, and especially of the brain, in the general- 

 ized Educabilia,* and the Pinnipeds, Sirenians, and Cetaceans 

 might go far to dissipate the doubts now involving the question, 

 and determine the truth one way or another. 



It appears, however, to be demonstrable, from what is already 

 known of the brain and the organization generally, that the muti- 

 lates are at least the offshoots from the same common progenitor 

 as the carnivores and other Educabilia ; and in view of the near 

 relations, even within the limits of the "super-order," it appears 

 also to be much more probable that the two orders of mutilates 

 have been derived from a common mutilate progenitor, than that 

 they have diverged independently from two different types of 

 quadrupeds within such circumscribed limits. Nor is there any 

 cogent evidence, apparently, against the descent of the Sirenians 

 from a mutilate descendant of a proto-inniped ancestor, either as to 

 adaptation for a vegetable I'egiraen or dentition. 



The author has, therefore, felt obliged, after mature reflection, 

 to adopt the views, current among most of the special students of 

 the mammals, that the Cetaceans and Sirenians are orders more 

 nearly related to each other than is either to any other order, and 



' The author has not access to the material, at present, for such an in- 

 vestisration. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 265 



that consequently the}' should be approximated to each other in 

 contrast with any forms to which they should be next placed, 

 wherever that may be. In this respect, as already- indicated, he is 

 at variance with some most learned and accomplished naturalists, 

 who have expressed decided views to the contrar}^; it being in- 

 sisted by them that the Sirenians are most nearly related to the 

 Paclij'derm Ungulates, and even (b}' some of them) that those 

 forms belong to the same special order as the Proboscideans, 

 H^'racoids, Perissodactyle Ungulates, and Omnivora ; in other 

 words, the Cuverian order Pachydermata modified by the addi- 

 tion to it of the Sirenians. 



Relations of Sirenians. 



The aflSnities of the Sirenians and Ungulates have been urged 

 with special emphasis, the view repeatedl}' reiterated in the United 

 States, and even generally' adopted by all but special students of 

 mammals (and not even excluding all of them), and in one of our 

 latest and most approved text-books on zoology, it is remarked ; 

 "The so-called Herbivorous whales, which Cuvier grouped with 

 the Cetaceans, are now placed with the Pachyderms, with which 

 they undoubtedly belong." It is, therefore, by no means a labor 

 of supererogation to examine into the evidence which has seemed. 

 to men justly celebrated for learning and acuteness, to justify 

 such a combination. 



The best epitome of the arguments (in English) in favor of 

 such collocation, has been published by Dr. S. Kneeland, in a 

 special memoir,* and for that reason it has been subjected to 

 examination and analj'sis, the data classified (no distinction being 

 made as to value or subordination in the memoir), and their value 

 weighed. 



It may be added, before proceeding to this analysis, that Dr. 

 J. F. Brandt has also compared, at much length, the characteris- 

 tics of the Sirenians with those of the Ungulates;- but he has 

 exhibited their diflferences as well as certain resemblances, and 

 has, indeed, been much more successful in the former portion of

his work than the latter. He, nevertheless, regards the Sirenians 

 as most nearly related to the Pachyderms, although entitled to 

 ordinal distinction, and even more distinct from the Pachyderms 

 than are the Cetaceans from the Carnivores, which are connected 

 hy inteinnediate forms {e.g. Zeuglodonts, Seals, and Sea-otters), 

 in this case of value and indicating affinity.' 



The analysis of the cited memoir gives the following results: — 

 \st. Character's supposed to differentiate the 3Ianatee from the 

 Cetaceans. 

 These may be arranged under three categories, viz: — 

 a. Those really differentiating the Manatee from all the Ceta- 

 ceans, to wit: the form of the vertebrae and the absence of ossified 

 epiphyses, the form of the scapula, the structure of the anterior 

 limb, the development of the occipital bone and the position of 

 the condyles, and the form of the lower jaw. 



h. Those not differentiating the Manatee from all the Cetaceans, 

 but from peculiar sub-orders of Cetaceans, viz., the absence of a 

 rostrum, position of the narial apertures, the presence of olfactory 

 nerves, the development of the nasal bones, and " the two bones 

 of the lower jaw [not] separate at the symphysis."

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 2GT 



Certain Zeuglodonts are equally characterized b^^ the absence of 

 a rostrum, and the position of the narial aperture. 



The Denticete alone are characterized hy the absence of olfac- 

 torj' nerves, and the rudimentar^f condition of the nasal bones. 



The Mysticete only are distinguished by the loose connection 

 of the rami of the lower jaw at the symphysis. 



c. Those not differentiating from the Cetaceans, or even from 

 sub-orders, but only from minor types, viz., the non-consolidation 

 of cervical vertebrae, the smaller number of vertebrte (50 to 53 

 against " at least" 60), the articulation of the ribs, the absence of 

 asymmetry of the bones on each side of the head, and the presence 

 of a lachrymal bone. 



The Iniidae, Platanistidse, and others, have as completely sepa- 

 rated cervical vertebrae as the Manatidje. 



The number of vertebra is less in Inia (41), Pontoporia (42), 

 Anarnacus or Sypet'oodon (44 to 45), and others, and is, at the 

 same time, of very slight taxonomic value. 



The articulation of the ribs is only of family value. 



The asymmetry of the cranial bones is most evident in the 

 Plnjaeteridse^ very slight or almost none in many Denticete, and 

 is not greater in the Mysticete than in the Sirenians. 



The lachrj'mal bone is evident in the fomil}^ of Ziphiids, and in 

 the Mysticete. 



Of course, then, only the characters differentiating the Sirenians 

 as a whole from the Cetaceans as a whole can be considered as 

 diagnostic or determinative of differences. The other alleged dis- 

 tinctions decrease in value in ratio to their restriction to subordi- 

 nate groups. 



But in addition to the characters alleged to differentiate the 

 Sirenians from the Cetaceans, others may be found in the modi- 

 fications of the brain, heart, etc., and all together amply support 

 the validity of the distinction of the ordinal separation of the 

 Sirenians from the Cetaceans, but they do not prove the propriety 

 of their ordinal union with any Ungulates. This must be proved 

 by the discovery of at least one character exclusively common to 

 the Sirenians and Ungulates ; we now propose to inquire if there 

 be such. 



2d. Characters common and confined to the Sirenians and the 

 Ungulate animals, or to any of the subordinate groups of Ungulates^ 



These may be examined under several heads. 




2G8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



a. Characters exclusively shared with all Ungulates. 



None. 



6. Characters exclusivel}' shared with all Pacliyderm Ungulates ; 

 that is, with the Suiform Artiodactyle Ungulates, the Perissodac- 

 tyle Ungulates, and the Proboscideans. 



None. 



c. Charactei's exclusively shared with all the Suiform Artiodac- 

 tjde Ungulates. 



None. 



d. Characters exclusively shared with all the Perissodactyle 

 Ungulates. 



None. 



e. Characters exclusively shared with all the Proboscideans. 

 None. 



Thus does it appear that in the wliole argument, no characters 

 have been adduced which are common to all the Sirenians and the 

 Ungulates, or even to them and any of the major subdivisions of 

 the latter group. It is true that it is especially stated that the 

 Manatee agrees with the Pachj^derms and differs from the Ceta- 

 ceans in the articulation of the ribs with the vertebrae, the form 

 of the scapula, the position of the occipital condjdes, and the union 

 above of the parietal bones, and the inference might be justifiable 

 from the context that the characters specified were confined to, as 

 well as common to, the two grou2)s, but such is not the case, for 

 all the characters in question are shared with quadruped mammals 

 generally. Being thus general, the characters are not decisive of 

 immediate relation and must be excluded as common property. 



It remains to examine into the taxonomic A'alue of the other 

 characters enumerated, which are now reduced to types of no more 

 than family, and sometimes of inferior value. 



/. The Manatee is said to resemble the Hippopotamus in the 

 "orbits almost entirely encircled with bone," and in the lower jaw — 

 that is, " in its curved form, descending angle, and symphysis." 



As to the encircled orbits, the nearest allies to the Manatee 

 have them open behind, and the nearest ally of the Hipp)opotamuH 

 {Chceropsis, belonging to the same family and very nearly related) 

 has them also open behind; therefoi'c, the slight taxonomic value 

 of the character becomes at once evident. 



As to the similarity of the lower jaw, the writer is unable to 

 perceive it, and the related forms of Sirenians and Hippopota- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 269 



midse differ miicli in the special characters alluded to. At any 

 rate, any slight superficial resemblance that may be imagined is 

 so completely offset by the fundamental differences between the 

 two types as to the lower jaw, and the superficial differences in 

 each of those t\'pes respectively in the modifications in question, 

 as to deprive it of any taxonomic significance. 



gr. The Manatee is said to reseml>le the Tapir in the humerus, 

 the nasal region, and the molars. 



" The humerus somewhat resembles the human femur in its 

 upper extremity ; in its lower portion, it more nearh' resembles, 

 both in shape and size, the humerus of the Tapir than of an^- other 

 Pachyderm.'" The lilieness is rather confined to size ; the simi- 

 larity in shape is so vague as to make it a matter of opinion 

 whether it is most like the humerus of the Tapir or some other 

 Pachyderm: the statement may be best met by the observation that 

 there is no such definite likeness as there is between the corres- 

 ponding bones of the Tapir, Rhinoceros, and Horse, compared 

 among themselves. 



" In the great length of the nasal opening ... in its hori- 

 zontal plane . . . and in the shortness of the nasal bones 

 (which cover only a small portion of the nasal cavit}'), the skull 

 of the Manatus comes nearest to the Tapir among living Pachy- 

 derms." It is merely in the length of the " nasal opening'' that 

 there is any resemblance between the Manatee and Tapir ; the3' 

 differ in toto in the contiguous bones, and especiall}' in the form 

 and relation of the nasal bones. 



" The molars [of Manatus] resemble, according to Mr. Owen, 

 the teeth of some of the fossil tapiroid Pachydermata.'' So do 

 the}', in the same general waj', resemble the teeth of the Probosci- 

 dean Dinotheriids, and those of the Marsupial Diprotodonts, and 

 they differ strikingly therein from their immediate relatives. "We 

 have, therefore, double evidence of the slight significance of such 

 resemblances, which, it is to be remarked, is also not a close but 

 a superficial one. 



CONCLrSIONS. 



In fine, this analysis of all the characters enumerated as evi- 

 dence of the afllnity of the Manatee and Pachyderms elicits no 

 characters that are at the same time common to and confined to the 




270 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



same types, and therefore diagnostic of the combined t3^pes. All 

 the characters are referable to the following categories: — 



1st. Characters differentiating the Manatee from the Cetaceans, 

 which (after proper restrictions) are granted, and more than 

 granted. 



2d. Characters common to generalized and quadruped mammals, 

 and therefore not distinctive.' 



3d. Characters confined to distant isolated and specialized types 

 of subordinate value, and whose very isolation and specialization 

 are evidence of their slight taxonomic significance. 



There is not a question of alternatives, as might be supposed 

 from the arguments noticed, between the Cetaceans or the Pach}-- 

 derms. Even if all the diflferences urged as distinctive of the 

 Sirenians from the Cetaceans were conceded, the views here 

 advocated — that the Sirenians are a distinct order — would loom 

 forth in proportionately more imposing form, but such differences 

 cannot be cast into the scale of the Pachyderms, as evidences of 

 affinity with them, since the^^ are of either a more generalized or 

 specialized value. 



The Sirenians not Pachyderms. 



In view of these facts, it seems evident that we must answer 

 the question proposed (" From these differences must we not 

 remove the Manatus from Cetacea and place it among Pachy- 

 dermata, where it stands in the same relation as do the seals 

 among the other Carnivora ?") decidedly in the negative as to the 

 latter and capital clause (but affirraativel}' as to the former and 

 subordinate one). This we are more prepared to do after having 

 ascertained that the advocate who has found no characters com- 

 mon and confined to the Manatee and the Pachyderms has found 

 several characters common to and confined to the Manatee and the 

 Cetaceans. 



It ma}- be added, too, that some of the characters which are, in 

 a measure, shared by peculiar forms of Sirenians and Ungulates 

 are adaptive or teleological modifications, having reference, how- 

 ever, to analogous rather than identical ends, and even requiring 

 some efl'ort of the imagination to detect the resemblance supposed 

 to exist. They are special characters gained by highl}' modified 

 forms, whose well-ascertained affinities forbid the idea of their 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 271 



inheritance from a common stock, and "nhich equally forbid the 

 idea of considering them as indications of affinity or likeness even 

 from a metaphj'sical point of view. 



Further Considerations. 



Among other characters supposed by various authors to justifv, 

 or even render "too evident not to be immediately appreciated,"* 

 the relations of the Sirenians and even true Cetaceans to the 

 Pachyderm Ungulates, are the considerable relative size and co- 

 ordinate increase of special parts, "the thick and naked skin," 

 " the variable and irregular teeth," as well as station. The varia- 

 bility and wide range in size and concomitant development within 

 the limits of a strictly natural group is, however, evidence of the 

 little value of the character, the skin is not naked in any Pachy- 

 derms, and it is not obvious how irrelative variability in dentition 

 is indicative of affinity when it presents no other elements of 

 similarity for comparison. Finall}', even conceding the value of 

 station as an element for the determination of ordinal affinities, 

 it is not " obvious" why the horses, the rhinoceroses, and allied 

 tjq^es, should be regarded as pre-eminently frequenters of rivers 

 and marshes. To the writer, at least, the affinities claimed are 

 not evident. 



Genealogy of Sirenians. 



The special relations among themselves of the Sirenians, at least 

 of those whose skeletal remains are in good part known, appear to 

 be tolerably evident, thanks to the labors of various zootomists, 

 but above all of Prof. Brandt.^ In Halitheriiun we have the most 



' " The relationship between the Cetacea [Gete and Sirenia} and the next 

 order [^'■Pachyderma''^] that offers itself to our notice is too evident not to 

 be immediately appreciated. The thick and naked skin, the gigantic body, 

 the massive bones, the bulky head, and even the variable and irregular 

 teeth that arm the ponderous jaws, are all again conspicuous ia the Pacht- 

 DERMATA ; and the river and the marsh, the localities frequented by the 

 latter, as obviously indicate the intermediate position which these animals 

 occupy between the aquatic and the terrestrial mammalia." — Jones's

generalized type, manifested as such by tlie less specialized denti- 

 tion, as well as by such osteological characters, among others, as 

 the greater development of the representative of the pelvis (made 

 known by Kaup) and the larger and more approximated nasal 

 bones. 



The forms to be approximated to Halitherium, as the nearest 

 ally, is, in the present condition of our knowledge, a problem 

 concerning which a reasonable difference of opinion may prevail, 

 Halicore and Ilanatus ( Trichechus) each having claims to such 

 alliances. Brandt has, however, conjoined with it, as a more 

 immediate relation, the genus Halicore (to which naturally suc- 

 ceeds Bhytina), and has associated the three genera mentioned 

 in a single famiij^, to which he has given the name Halicoridae} 

 The differences between those genera are, however, of greater 

 taxonomic value than generic, and appear to well merit the 

 distinction of family rank, which has been alread}'^ conferred 

 on them by several naturalists. With such value, therefore, 

 those genera liave been accredited now, but as they form a 

 natural series they have been combined in a special superfhmily 

 {Halicoroidea). The difierence between the extremes of that 

 superfamily is, at least in some respects, greater than between its 

 most generalized t3-pe and the remaining well-known members of 

 the order — {Trichechidae or 3Ianatidse) — and to mark the limit 

 in a specialized direction of the series, the superfamily is adopted. 



The 3Ianatidse (Trichechidae) succeed then, not as most nearl}'- 

 related to the extreme term of the preceding series, but as so 

 nearly related to the proximal term as to perhaps even merit 

 further examination, whether they are not really more nearl^'^ 

 related to it than the dugongs, and consequently better entitled 

 to be associated with it in contradistinction to the others. The 

 capital character of the Halicoridae of Brandt (the Halicoroidea

of the present arrangement), that is, the depressed caudal vertebrae 

 and the development of transverse processes, has not been con- 

 firmed as to the Halitheriidae, and is applied on the supposition 

 that it is a co-ordinate of the other characters in which it approxi- 

 mates most to the dugongs. It must depend on future discover}* 

 whether the aggregate of common characters and the taxonomic 

 value of those characters confirm the present combinations. 



With respect to the Halicoridse and Bhytinidse, the conditions 

 of a natural sequence are apparentl}* best fulfilled by the approxi- 

 mation of the former to the Halitheriidse. The Rhytinidse exhibits 

 a highly specialized modification in several features, and especiall}^ 

 in the absence of teeth and the length of the intestinal canal ; it, 

 however, affords a more generalized condition than the Halioridae 

 in other respects, and notablj' in the development of the carpal 

 bones, and cannot, therefore, be regarded as a derivative from the 

 Halitheridae family as now limited. But as it exhibits in all 

 respects a less generalized condition than the Halitheridae, it must 

 be regarded as the result of development since the culmination or 

 that tj'pe. The genealogical tree of the order ma}' then be repre- 

 sented as follows : —

Various other extinct forms have been referred with more or

OBSEKVATIONS ON CHANGE IN STRUCTURE OF A LARVA OF DRYOCAMPA 



IMPERIALIS. 



BY THOMAS G. GENTRY. 



I desire to call the attention of the Academj'- to some import- 

 ant structural changes in a larva of Dryocampa imperialis. which 

 came under my observation during the early part of last August, 

 as they show sufficient reasons, in my opinion, for the withdrawal 

 of the imperialis of Drur^', from the new genus of Dryocampa, 

 and its reinstatement in the old one of Ceratocampa. Besides, 

 they afford additional proofs to the many which have already 

 been noticed b}"^ naturalists, of the incompetency of Darwin's 

 theory of natural selection in every case, to account for the origin 

 of species, b}' minute, indefinite, fortuitous variations, without 

 the aid of other and more important causes. 



In this vicinit}^, during the last four j-ears, I have found the 

 larva of Dryocampa imj^erialis feeding principall}' upon the leaves 

 of Juniperus communis and J. Virginiana^ and occasional!}' upon 

 some few species of Pinus ; but prior to the above time, so far as 

 I have been able to determine, it has never been observed feeding 

 upon the various species of Juglans, etc., in company with the 

 larva of C. regalis. 



At the time above mentioned I found the larva of what I 

 supposed to be the G. regalis feeding on an English walnut. I 

 felt no little surprise at the unusual appearance which it pre- 

 sented, and I was at first somewhat dubious, whether to refer it 

 to C regalis or D. imperialism as it contained marked characters 

 of both. If it had been in one of its earliest stages, it would not 

 have excited wonder since the young of the two bear such a close 

 resemblance to each other; but this specimen had attained the 

 period of its final change. In size, color, and the nearly equal 

 development of the spinous projections of the dorsal surface of 

 the tlioracic segments, it agreed with C regalis ; in the diminu- 

 tiveness of the abdominal projections, and in the moderately sized 

 hairs which rather closel}' invested the worm upon the superior 

 and lateral surfaces, it agreed with D. imperialis. I might add 

 that the chrysalis approximates the genus Ceratocampa in general 

 appearance, and in the conformation of the terminal appendage 

 or spine, more nearly than Dryocampa. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 275 



These characters -would seem to imply a case of hj'bridism. but 

 I thiuk differentl}-. Ilaving raised scores of the males and 

 females of both species in the same box, I have never observed a 

 single irregular union — the males of both invariably'' seeking their 

 own kind. So deeply is the sexual instinct implanted in them 

 that the females, rather than submit to copulation with species 

 essentially unlike, deposit their ova unfertilized. I am inclined 

 to the belief that C. rerjalis^ being a higher type of insect than D. 

 impei'ialis had been evolved from the latter in obedience to inter- 

 nal changes bi'ought about through the medium of nutrition; said 

 changes having been moderately sudden instead of slow and 

 gradual. 



That nutrition plaj's such an important part in the evolution of 

 species, may seem to be speculation, without facts to sustain it. 

 If nutrition should be proved to be the means by which the sexes 

 in insects are controlled, as a paper in "The American Naturalist," 

 b}' Mrs. Mary Treat, would indicate, I cannot discern why it should 

 not be applicable to a certain extent to the production of species. 



In the case under consideration, the change from diet contain- 

 ing but a small percentage of nutritive matter, as leaves of 

 conifers possess, to more nutritious food, has, in mj' estimation, 

 been the agent in producing the changes above indicated. That 

 these changes have not been going on for indefinite periods, but 

 have been the work of a short time, I think is evident. 



If, through the medium of nutrition, D. iniperialis is brought 

 to assume many of the prominent characters of C. regalis^ I do 

 not see the propriety of jjlacing the former in a distinct genus 

 from the latter, in consequence of a slight difference in the size of 

 the antennse, and in the position of the posterior wings in a state 

 of rest in the adult state : as the close resemblance which obtains 

 between the two larvas when young, seems to imply a near rela- 

 tionship. Harris, in referring D. iniperialis, of Drur^' to Dr3-o- 

 campa, did so under considerable hesitation. The fact that there 

 is such a near alliance, backed up by those set forth in this paper, 

 if they are rightly interpreted, would seem to warrant its rein- 

 statement in the old genus Ceratocampa.

 Thirty-two members present. 



Double Flowers in Epigeea repens. — Mr. Thomas Meehan ob- 

 served, that on several occasions, during the few past years, it 

 had been noticed among tlie variations in nature, that the ten- 

 dency to produce double flower was, by no means, the special 

 prerogative of the florist to produce. Many of our commonest 

 wild flower, which no one would think of cultivating, had double 

 forms in cultivation which were no doubt originally found wild. 

 Thus we had a double Ranunculus acris, Ranunculus bulbosus, 

 R. Ficaria, R. repens, and some others. He had himself placed 

 on record the discovery, wild on the Wissahickon, of a double 

 Saxifraga Virginica, and this season a fellow member, Dr. James 

 Darrach,had found, in the same location, a double Trailing Arbu- 

 tus, Epigsea repens. There were, in plants, two methods by which 

 a double flower is produced. The axis of a flovver was sirapl}'^ a 

 branch very much retarded in its development, and generally 

 there were, on this arrested branch, many nodes between the 

 series forming the calyx or corolla, and the regular stamens and 

 carpels, which were entirely snppressed. But when a double 

 flower was produced, sometimes these usually suppressed nodes 

 would become developed, in which case there was a great increase 

 in the number of petals, without any disturbance in the staminal 

 characters. But at other times there was no disturbance of the 

 normal character of the axis. The stamens themselves merely 

 became petaloid. This was the case in the Epigaea, now found by 

 Dr. Darrach. He was not alone in calling* attention to these 

 facts in wild flowers. Dr. Gray and others had recorded instances 

 in the American Naturalist. 



Influence of Cohesion on Change of Characters in Orchidese. — 

 Mr. M. also said that in the early part of the winter he had 

 exhibited some flowers of Phaius Tankervillse, in which, by the 

 mere cohesion of one of the dorsal petals with the column, a 

 flower diff'ering very much from the general condition was the 

 result ; and that it was evidently the direction of nutrition 

 towards the production of a spur, which resulted in the formation 

 of the labellate petal which gave such a distinguishing character 

 to the general orchideae flower. At that time he had observed 

 that ver}^ early in the morning a very small secretion, from what 

 appeared to be incipient glands, might be seen at the exterior 

 base of the outer petals, and that there was no improbability that 

 in time an orchid would be produced, Avhich would have, from 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 277 



these glands, three spurs and their petals, giving the flower the 

 appearance of an Aquilegia. Since that time Dr. Maxwell T. 

 Masters, in the April 12th issue of the Gardener's Chronicle, 

 notices the receipt of a Phaius Wallichii in which there had been 

 produced three spurs and regular petals, looking. Dr. M. sajs, 

 rather like those of a gladiolus than of an orchid. This confirma- 

 tion of the views, suggested in the observations referred to. indi- 

 cate that we were on the right track as regards idea of the floral 

 structure. 



Movements in Stigraatic Lohps^. — Mr. Meehan further remarked 

 that at former meetings he had brought to the attention of the 

 Academy', that though it was long known that the flattened lobes 

 of the pistil in Miniulus would close on being touched, as rapidly 

 and in the same manner as the leaves of the Dionsea muscipida, 

 it did not seem to have been noted that the power was possessed 

 by many other genera of Scrophulariacsea., and he had recently 

 recorded the fact that the power extended to Bignoaia in an 

 allied natural order. It would be as well to call the attention of 

 the Academy to the fact that in the current number of the Lon- 

 don Journal of Botany, Mr. Kitchener has a note on the move- 

 ment in Mimulus, regarding it as an arrangement to render the 

 fertilization of the plant, by its own pollen, highly improbable. 

 If it were not for the closing of the lobes on the entrance of an 

 insect, pollen would be deposited when the insect makes its exit ; 

 but the closing of the lobes on the entrance prevents this. On 

 the other hand, when the pollen covered insect enters another 

 flower and touches the open pistil it receives and closes on foreign 

 pollen. As the common trumpet flower of our gardens, Bignonia 

 radicans, is easy of access, he hoped that the members interested 

 in this branch of science would make personal observations the 

 coming season.

This genus is highly interesting as connecting more or less 

 nearly the genus Trionyx ^'it\\ the Chelydrine form Anosfira. It 

 is represented by several species in the Bridger Eocene, all of 

 which have the sculpture of both of the genera named. The 

 plastron is ossified nearly as in Anosfi7-a ; but in the numerous 

 specimens obtained there was not one marginal bone. Never- 

 theless the strong emargination of the proximal end of the second 

 costals proves the presence of a nuchal marginal which does not 

 exist in Trionyx ; if there were other marginals the}"^ must have 

 been small and inclosed in a cartilaginous margin. The first 

 costals were much shorter than the second, and much as in Trio- 

 nyx. A costal process of the first dorsal extends backwards and 

 was attached by suture to the second costal bone, just in front of 

 its ca[)itulum, as in Trionyx, CheJydra, etc. A singular sternal 

 bone accompanies the specimens of P. thomasii and P. triony- 

 choides, but partially fractured in both cases so as to leave its 

 position uncertain. It can be nothing else than the median portion 

 of a hyosternal with the outer extremity wanting. It bounds a 

 fontanelle interiorl}'^, which nearly reaches the hyposternal; ante- 

 riorly it has sutures for both mososternum and clavicle. It is 

 entirely unlike anything in Trionyx ; it is thickened towards the 

 median line and strongly sculptured externally. The hyo or 

 hyposternal in the " bridge" indicates that portion to have been 

 long, and about as wide as is usual in Trionyx. Its free edge is 

 thin ; the sutural union Avith the other component bone complete. 

 The t^'pe of the genus is F. thomasii (Trionyx thomasii. Cope).

Lilium Washingtonianum. — Mr. Thomas Meehan referred to a 

 paper by Prof. Alphonso Wood, entitled a Sketch of the Natural 

 Order of Liliacese of the Pacific coast, published in the volume of 

 the Proceedings for 1868, in which he describes a "new species" 

 of Lilium, as L. Washingtojiianum, giving, as a reason for the 

 name, that it was generallj' known as the " Lady Washington" 

 by the miners. Prof. W. said, in his paper, that it was remarkable 

 so fine a plant had been overlooked b}' other botanists. It so 

 happens that it had not been overlooked, but had been described 

 ten years previoush' by Dr. Kellogg, in the Proceedings of the 

 California Acadeni}' for 1858. Through the unusual circumstance 

 of two authors emplo^'ing the same name, the confusion and 

 trouble which loose and careless habits in describers bring on 

 students, in the present case, will not be great; yet it is but just 

 to Dr. Kellogg that this correction should go into the records of

On a Species of Delphinus. — By Dr. H. C. Chapman. The

 points in the economy of the Cetacea, and of noticing that the 

 structure of the specimen before us offers a good illustration of the 

 descriptions given by Cuvier, Owen, and others, of this order of 

 mammalia. 



Of the external characters the most striking are, the Avell- 

 developed caudal fin, the effective instrument of locomotion ; the 

 dorsal and pectoral fins, the blow hole, the very small external 

 opening of the organ of hearing, and the genital aperture. 



The digestive sj'stem exhibits a highly complex stomach, divided 

 into several cavities, the oesophagus and duodenum being large. 




280 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



There is no demarcation between small and large intestines, but 

 they are of great length. This is as might be expected when one 

 considers the vast amount of nutriment required b}- a lung- 

 breathing animal living under such conditions of existence. 



The circulation of the blood otters us interesting peculiarities 

 in the existence of vast plexuses, the breaking up of the brachial 

 and other arteries into rete mirabile. Of the distribution of the 

 arteries, the intercostals are the most remarkable. They are 

 developed, twisted, interlaced to such an extent, as to give the 

 appearance of a large thoracic gland, formerly in fact described as 

 such. B}' this arrangement of the intercostal and otheu arteries 

 there are formed large reservoirs of arterialized blood, enabling 

 the animal no doubt to remain submerged for long periods of time. 



The dividing of the brachial artery into numerous branches has 

 been explained b}^ reference to the shortness of the pectoral fin or 

 upper extremity, but this distribution has been observed in certain 

 Lemurs and other animals, in which the upper extremity is well 

 developed. 



The lungs were large in the specimen before us, and the trachea 

 gave oft' a third bronchus. 



The kidne}^ was divided into many distinct lobes, each of which 

 was supplied by a branch of the renal artery. 



In conclusion, we take the opportunity of impressing the 

 members with the importance of obtaining as many specimens of 

 the Cetacea as possible. Naturalists have experienced much 

 difliculty in identifying the different members of this order, due 

 no doubt to their want of material.

INFLUENCE OF NTJTEITION ON SEX AMONG THE LEPIDOPTEEA. 

 BY THOMAS G. GENTRY. 



That the sexes among plants are controlled b}' the laio of nu- 

 trition, I think has been demonstrated by Mr. Thomas Meehau,in 

 his communications to the Academj- of Natural Sciences, published 

 in its proceedings, in the American Naturalist, and in other scien- 

 tific journals. The facts which appear in his contributions upon 

 this subject were the results of close research and careful stud3\ 

 To him must be ascribed, not onl}- the credit of having established 

 the existence of the afore-mentioned law, but also the hint of its 

 potency iu animals. 



Mrs. Mary Treat, I believe, is entitled to the credit of first 

 showing its applicability in insects, in a paper which appeared in 

 the American Xaturalist for March, 1813. The facts set forth in 

 her paper were founded on observations upon the larvae of some 

 species of Diurnal Lepidoptera during the summer of 1872. The 

 inferences which she drew from her observations were substantially^ 

 as follows : Whenever the larva? were deprived of food, or were 

 stinted in quantit}-, in the interval between the last two changes, 

 males were produced iu the generality of cases ; but when the 

 food was regularh* supplied, and in bulk necessarv for the wants 

 of the larvce, the opposite sex was almost invariabl\' produced. 



The facts which I have to offer bearing upon the genesis of 

 sexes, date back to the summer of 1871, whilst engaged in the 

 rearing of the larvae of many of our Twiliglit and Xight Fliers, 

 and in the study of their various metamorphoses. The discovery 

 was the result of accident : I had confined a number of the larvae 

 of Attacus cecropia, A. polyphemus, A. prometheus, and Saturnia 

 lo, in a box, and had neglected to supply them with food for four 

 da3's. These larvae had advanced towai'd their final change, 

 possibl}' within a week or ten days. When I opened the box, the 

 greater number, which fell not much short of a score and a half, 

 had concealed themselves within cocoons ; the remainder still 

 wandered about, as if in quest of food, or seeking for some 

 opening through which to escape. These latter I removed from 

 the box to another, where the}' were provided with an abundance of 

 food. They immediately recommenced feeding. After three or 

 19 




282 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



four days they began to assume the chrysalis form. After several 

 weeks I removed the usual silken covering, as has alvvaj's been 

 my custom, from the fact that past experience has shown me that 

 the development proceeds more rapidly, especially when they are 

 kept in a room where the temperature through the cold season of 

 the year falls not short of 70° Fah. I was surprised to find that 

 those which had changed first turned out to be males without ex- 

 ception, while the last batch, consisting of a dozen cocoons, proved 

 with but two exceptions to be females. Here was a problem to 

 solve, and in reflecting upon the subject it occurred to me that 

 possibly Mr. Meehan's law of nutrition would furnish me with an 

 explanation of it. I conducted a series of experiments during the 

 ensuing summer, to test the truth of m}' observations. Accord- 

 ingly in August and September I procured besides specimens of 

 the larvae above mentioned, many of the Ceratocampa regalis, 

 Dryocampa imperialis, Sphinx qimiqiiemacidata, S. Carolina^ 

 Smerinthus excsecata, and others of the Sphinx family. These 

 Avorras were taken while passing through the period intervening 

 between the last and the preceding changes. In nearlj^ every case 

 the worms were selected as shortl}' after the next to tlie last change 

 as was possible. These worms, amounting to three scores, were 

 divided into two equal sets and placed in separate boxes. The 

 one set was deprived of all food ; the other was kept provided 

 with fresh, wholesome fare in abundance. The members of the 

 first set, after the expiration of a few days, began to appear ex- 

 ceedingly restless, as if looking for some convenient place to hang 

 their cocoons, or to deposit their chr3^salides. Those of the second 

 kept on feeding for a week or ten days, and then began to undergo 

 their final transformation. The diflference in the appearance of 

 the two sets was quite perceptible. The former were small, and 

 presented the look of animals that had been ill-fed ; the latter 

 were large and plump, and showed evidence of having fed sumptu- 

 ousl3\ After allowing sufficient time to elapse for the chrysalides 

 to form and harden, I began the work of divesting them of their 

 cocoons. 1 found that the chrysalides of the one, as the greater 

 breadth of the antenna^, which was already mapped out, would 

 seem to indicate, were invariably males, while the other, judging 

 from the narrowness of the antennae, proved with but two excep- 

 tions to be the opposite sex. The chrysalides of the Sphinxes pre- 

 sented a similar state of affairs. The appearance of the perfected 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 283 



moths proved that the sexes had been distinctly indicated by the dif- 

 ference in the breadth of the antennae as observed in the chrysalides. 

 During m}^ observations and experiments the following additional 

 facts came under my notice : Firstly, that males are the inva- 

 riable result when the larvag are fed upon diseased or innutritious 

 food ; secondly', that in the fall of the year, when the leaves have 

 become deprived of their usual amount of sap, males are generally 

 produced ; thirdh\ that more males are produced late in the sea- 

 son than females ; fourtbl}', that the sexes in earl}^ life cannot be 

 distinguished, or in other words, that there would appear to be no 

 such distinction as male and female, the change being brought 

 about late in life through the medium of nutrition.

 to be living except 2 in July and 2 in August. These were each 

 month laid aside and not moistened again until September. At

Meeting of the Conchological Section. 



Dr. RuscHENBERGER, Director, in tlie chair. 



Mr. Tryon called attention to an interesting series of land and 

 fluviatile Mollusca from Utah, presented this evening. 



These shells were collected by the Wheeler Exploring Expedi- 

 tion, acting under authority of the U. S. Engineer Office at 

 Washington. 



The specimens of Helix Htrigosa, Gould, exhibit every variation 

 of form from the typical shells with depressed rounded whorls 

 and smooth surface, to those with several revolving raised lines 

 and a carinated periphery ; in the latter condition they are iden- 

 tical with H. Eemphillii^ Newcomb (Amer. Journ. Conch, v. 165, 

 18G9, "White Pine Mining District"). In others, again, the 

 raised lines are more numerous and sufficiently prominent to be 

 called ribs, and the periphery is not carinated ; in this state they 

 are H. Raydeni, Gabb (Am. Journ. Conch, v. 24, 1869). 



The latter species has been heretofore considered to belong to 

 a new generic t^'pe for America, being the onU' species having 

 revolving ribs: its nearest relationship Avas apparently with a 

 small group of Madeiran Helices. The form of the shell, its 

 external apjiearance, and the closely approaching extremities of 

 the labrum, connected by a callus upon the parietal wall, reminds 

 one of Cydostoma ; but no opercula were obtained with the fifty 

 odd specimens in semi-fossilized condition, collected b}^ Prof. F. 

 y. Haj'den, in Webber Canon, Utah. 



It is extraordinary that any species should be found to var}- so 

 much as does H. strigosa^ in those characters which have hereto- 

 fore been regarded as most persistent and distinctive. It is much 

 easier to imagine the growth lines developed into ribs, than a 

 form in w'hich the growth lines are crossed by revolving ribs. In 

 H. Idahoeiisis, Newcomb (Ibid. ii. 1, 1866), we find the surface 

 raised into sharp ribs parallel with the lines of accretion, and, as 

 in all other respects, this species does not appear to diflfer from 

 strigosa; it is very probable that Idahoensis will also prove to be 

 a variety of this protean species.

Included in the collection are two specimens of the genus 

 Tryonia, Stimpson. This curious little genus was heretofore 

 considered to be restricted to the Colorado Desert of southern 

 California, where, in a fossilized condition, it exists in such num- 

 bers as frequently to cover the surface of the ground. Two 

 species have been described, viz., the type T. (Melania) exigua, 

 Conrad, of which Melania protea, Gould, is a synonj'm, and 

 Tryonia clathroM, Stimpson. The two Utah specimens are 

 probably T. exigua. 



The genus Tryonia is included in a group of very small species

Fertilization of Pedicularis Canadensis. — Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 drew attention to the structure of the flower of Pedicularis Cana- 

 densis^ in which it was evident self-impregnation was impossible, 

 and there seemed to be no special arrangements for fertilization 

 by distinct agency, as there were in so many allied plants. In this 

 case the stamens were included in the closely compressed arch of 

 the corolla, and, with the anthers, were directed retrorsel_7 to the 

 pistil, which at an early stage, and long before the maturity of the 

 pollen, was protruded beyond the corolla, rendering self-fertiliza- 

 tion almost impossible in this flower. But the flowers were al- 

 ways abundantly fertile, and thougli the arrangements were such 

 as seemingh' to aff'ord no chance even for insects to aid in the 

 fertilization, it was also probable that in some way it was accom- 

 plished by them. Both last season and this he had devoted 

 some time to watching the plant, but failed to find any clue to the 

 process. A species of Bombus seemed to have the plant especially- 

 under its charge, visiting the flowers in great numbers ; but they 

 bored through the corolla on the outside of the tube for the saccha- 

 rine matter, and the anthers or pollen did not seem to be in the 

 least disturbed by this. Still it was so highl3' probable that in 

 some wa^- some insect aided in the cross-fertilization of these 

 flowers, that it mig^it serve a useful purpose to direct attention to 

 it, as others with time and opportunity might discover what he 

 had failed to find.

Mr. Gentry made the following remarks : — 



At the last meeting of the Academy, Mr. Meehan made some 

 observations upon the peculiar structure of the flowers of Pedicu- 

 laris canadensis, observing that he had vainly watched them 

 during two seasons with the view of determining the manner in 

 which they were fertilized. He further said that he had noticed 

 that the}' received the attention of a species of bumble-bee, for the 

 sake of their honey, which in order to accomplish its purpose al- 

 ways bored a hole into the side of the tube. 




288 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



On "Wednesday morning last, I A'isited a spot where the plants 

 were growing luxuriantly, affording an interesting field for obser- 

 vation. It was not long before I observed a Bombus terreatris to 

 alight upon the outer side of the tube of a flower, at a distance of 

 three feet from me. At this distance it did seem as if the bee in 

 order to obtain the honey which the flower secretes, produced a 

 slit into the tube, as Mr. Meehan observed. But the movements 

 of the bee being so quick, and the distance too great to judge 

 accurately, I approached the insect b}' degrees, until I was within 

 three inches of it, when the whole process became apparent. The 

 bee, however, was so intent upon its labors, as not to take any 

 notice of me. 



The flower is composed of an erect tube, with a natural cleft 

 running along its lateral walls from above, through one-third its 

 entire length, presenting outwardl}'' apparently a mere crease, 

 from the manner in which the compressed margins of the upper 

 lip fit into the rolled-in edges of the lateral lobes of the under 

 lip. The upper lip is compressed, arched, and beaked, presenting 

 an aperture at the apex, through which passes a curved pistil, the 

 lower lip is reflexed, consisting of three lobes, one median and 

 two lateral, assuming a platform arrangement. Enclosed within 

 the upper li{) are four stamens, did^'namous, with their anthers 

 turning backwards, facing each other ventrally. When ripe these 

 anthers split upon the inner side, thus giving a fancied resemblance 

 to an oval snuff-box, thrown backwards upon its hinges. Each 

 cell is filled with white pollen grains. 



Now when the bee alights upon the tube, by means of its ti'unk, 

 it opens the natural cleft above alluded to, and having thus gained 

 a partial entrance, it would defeat its intention, did not the length 

 of the flower's tube when contrasted with that of the bee's trunk, 

 necessitate the admission of the entire head also. In this opera- 

 tion the lips of the flower are pressed apart, the margins of the 

 upper lip are separated to receive the head, and the pollen grains, 

 alreadj^ I'ipe, by the considerable motion to which they are sub- 

 jected, become dislodged from their cells, and ftill down in a dense 

 shower upon the bee's back and head. Having obtained the 

 coveted sweet, it flies to another flower upon a different stalk, as 

 I observed in a score of cases during two da^ys ; but before renewing 

 the preceding operations, stations itself awhile upon the lower 

 lip, its head coming in contact with the stigma of the pistil. Then, 

 hy means of the hairs that line the inner side of the tarsus of each 

 anterior leg, and the constant rubbing together of the parts com- 

 prising its tropin or instrumenta cibaria, the attached pollen 

 grains are sent flying in every direction, sure to adhei'e to the 

 stigma. 



Whilst observing the above process. I also noticed that after 

 the lips had been pressed apart and were permitted to regain tlieir 

 position, the upper lip, being somewhat elastic, sprung back to 

 its place with considerable force, sending through the aperture. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 289 



through which passes the pistil, a complete cloud of pollen, en- 

 veloping the stigma upon eveiy side. 



This operation can be performed artificially, bj- taking hold of 

 the under lip with the left thumb and fore-fiuger, and pulling the 

 upper lip backward, bj^ the right, and then releasing the hold of 

 the latter: the upper lip springs to its place, spirting the pollen 

 through the aperture upon the left hand. From the above it is to 

 be seen, that the plant has two chances of being fertilized — one by 

 its own pollen, and the other b}- that of another. Although the 

 flower seeds abundantly, j'et I am disposed to think that it is 

 mainly through the pollen of another that the seeds become per- 

 fect. I incline to this opinion because, in an examination of many 

 j)ods, I noticed that a few seeds were found in a rudimentary 

 condition, apparenth^ manifesting a tendency to abort, while the 

 majority were in a vigorous condition ; the former, doubtless, being 

 the effects of self-fertilization in part, which, as is well-known, is a 

 degenerating process. 



I desire also to call attention to an interesting discovery which 

 I was enabled to make recentlj^, whilst engaged in an examination 

 of a double flower of Ranunculus fascicularis. In the genus 

 Ranunculus, the corolla of a normal flower is made up of five 

 petals, each of which on the inner side of its basal part is usually 

 provided with a scale. This scale from its position is denominated 

 the nectariferous scale. 



In the specimen under consideration three of these scales had 

 assumed the character of petals, agreeing with the flower's true 

 petals in every particular except size, being but three-fourths the 

 dimension of the latter. It very frequently happens that we find, 

 in examining flowers, parts which we can refer to no organ with 

 which we have become acquainted. They appear to be distinct 

 from any of the whorls which make up a perfect flower, although 

 located among them and attached perhaps to them. All such 

 parts are designated as appendages. Under this category are 

 placed the scales that are characteristic of some species of Crow- 

 foot. 



Prof. Liudley thinks that these small appendages are barren 

 stamens united to the bases of the petals. This opinion I think 

 is a just one. 



From the facts here indicated it is reasonable to conclude, that 

 the double flowers of the Ranunculus do not alwa^'s originate by 

 true starainal metamorphosis, but sometimes by scale transforma- 

 tion ; also that nectariferous scales when they exist are barren 

 stamens, which favorable conditions may develop into true petals. 



Whilst examining several specimens of Potentilla canadensis 

 lately, I was struck with the variableness displayed in the number 

 of segments which constituted their outer or cahxine whorls. This 

 series in Potentilla^ as is well known, consists of five sepals, with 

 as many intermediate bractlets. 




290 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



In the specimens to which I refer, I counted from seven to ten 

 bractlets. This numerical variation I am confident results from 

 the si)litting, so to speak, of some or all of the primary- bractlets, 

 as specimens were observed which exhibited all the transitional 

 forms, from a slight indentation at the apex to partial and complete 

 division.

LawH of Sex in Juglans nigra. — Mr. Thomas Meehan said he 

 had at various times during the past few years called the attention 

 of the Academ}' to specimens of numerous plants which illustrated 

 the principle that sex in plants was the result of grades of vitality; 

 or, as it had been suggested, viabilit}"^ ; and that this power of life 

 was a mere matter of nutrition; the highest grades of vitality 

 onl}' producing the female sex. Almost au}^ monoecious plants 

 furnished the necessarj' evidence of the truth of this position, 

 and what he had said or written on the subject had always been 

 done more to direct attention, and to lead others to examine plants 

 themselves, than that the facts were exhausted. He believed that 

 in the main the principle had been so generally accepted by natu- 

 ralists, that it seemed unnecessary for him to say any more on the 

 subject, but let it novv work its own way. At the meeting of the 

 American Association, at Dubuque, last 3'ear, which he had not 

 the pleasure of attending, the subject was introduced; and though, 

 as he gathered from the i)ublic papers, the principle was to a cer- 

 tain extent admitted, objection was made that possibl}'^ the weak- 

 ened shoot or axis bearing male flowers was a result of the pro- 

 duction, and if so it would show rather a great expenditure of 

 vital force in their formation, than afibrd a proof of the principle 

 under discussion. He was astonished at the suggestion at the 

 time, exhibiting as it did, he thought, a careless reading of his 

 papers ; as he had stated, and exhibited the facts supporting the 

 statement to the Academy, that, especially in coniferse, the weak- 

 ening process had been going on for several seasons prior to the 

 production of male flowers. In the pine and spruce, for instance, 

 he had distinctly stated, that only those branches the most favorably 

 situated to derive the greatest benefit from nutritive forces bore 

 female flowers. These branches in time naturall}^ became shaded 

 by succeeding growths. The partial shade was injurious to per- 

 fect nutrition. A few years of these circumstances weakened the 

 branch, and after being thus weakened^ the male catkins appeared. 

 There were of course other agencies at work besides shade ; what- 

 ever they were, the result in sex was the same. He did not think 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 291 



it worth while to reiterate, at the time these objections were made; 

 but concluded to wait till this season, and introduce facts from 

 some plant not already named in connection with that sexual law. 

 He now exhibited specimens of the common black walnut. 

 Juglans nigra^ which furnislied excellent illustrations of what had 

 been said on other occasions. Examining the tree at the flowering 

 season, it would be plainly' seen by even a superficial observer 

 that there were three grades of growing buds. The largest buds 

 made the most vigorous shoots. These seemed to be wholly devoted 

 to tlie increase of the wood}- sj'stem of tiie tree. Lower down the 

 strong last 3'ear shoots, were buds not quite so large. These made 

 shoots less vigorous than the other class, and bore the female 

 flowers on their apices. Below these were numerous small weak 

 buds, which either did not push into growth at all, or when they 

 did bore simply the male catkins. Xo one who gave this matter 

 any examination with the tree before him, would for a moment 

 entertain the idea that these branches and these buds had been 

 weakened by the effort to produce male flowers. He was full}' 

 satisfied that any one who would go out into the woods and fields 

 for their own facts fresh from nature, would be abundantly satis- 

 fied that there is not so great expenditure of vital force in the 

 production of male flowers as there is in female flowers, and that 

 all he had advanced on the subject was fully borne out.

OBSERVATIONS ON NESTS OF SAYORNIS FUSCUS. 

 BY THOS. G. GENTRY. 



It is the commonly received opinion that birds of the same 

 species uniforml}- build their nests of the same materials and in 

 the same form and situation though thej'^ inhabit different climates. 

 This, however, is not invariably' the case, as a few observations 

 will show. On the north branch of the Susquehanna, some 

 months since, I procured several nests of our common Phebe 

 bird, Sai/ornis fuscus, Baird, which in size, structure, and ma- 

 terials might be taken as nests of species distinct from the one 

 under consideration. As these nests were found upon the hori- 

 zontal beams of a wagon-shed they would not seem to require 

 such compactness of structure as when built in more exposed 

 situations. 



After a careful examination of several nests from different 

 localities, I find that they are usuall}' circular at the top, with a 

 depth externally, differing but little from the average diameter. 

 By measurement I obtain the following dimensions : Diameter 

 from side to side, 3^ in., depth 3 in. ; diameter of cavity within, 

 2^ in., making the thickness of the lateral walls ^ in.; depth of 

 cavity 1^ in., indicating a thickness at the bottom of 1^ in. These 

 nests are composed of fine roots, grasses, fine mosses, and hairs, 

 which are plastered together, and to the objects upon which the}'- 

 are built, b}- pellets of mud ; within the}' are lined with soft grasses, 

 lint, hairs, and sometimes with wool and feathers. 



Number one of deviation is nearlv circular, with an average 

 diameter of 4 in. and a depth of 2 in., being considerably de- 

 pressed. Diameter of cavity 2Mn., depth 1 in.; thickness of lateral 

 walls I in. ; at the bottom 1 in. The nest is constructed wholly 

 of the silk of corn, with a few strings and hairs on the inside for 

 a lining; the absence of moss and claj' pellets being a noticeable 

 feature of the nest ; such ordinarily indispensable materials evi- 

 dently not being requisite, if the site of the nest affords any cri- 

 terion of judging. 



Number two of these anomalous forms is circular, with a 

 diameter of 5 in., and a depth of 2^ in. on the outside ; within 2^ 

 in. in diameter, and 2 in. in depth ; lateral walls 1^ in. in thick- 

 ness ; inferior ^ in. The entire nest is composed of the inner 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 293 



bark of the chestnut, plucked, doubtless, from fence mils, and 

 reduced to verj' fine strips for the inner part of the nest, and 

 graduall}' attaining a width of nearly one-fourth of an inch on 

 the exterior. 



In an intermediate form between the ordinary- form and the first 

 deviation therefrom, I find the diameter 4^ in. externally', depth 

 2 in. ; cavity 2^ in., and depth 1^ in.; lateral walls each 1 in.; in- 

 ferior i in. This nest is formed of fine grasses, hair, wool, and 

 an abundance of moss externally ; within it is lined b^^ fine grasses 

 and hairs ; the absence of clay would seem to impl}' an unexposed 

 place for its site, to which theory the looseness of its structure 

 most assuredly* adds weight. 



That a species which has always been known to build a nest 

 so characteristic as the pewee should deviate so considerably, 

 and suddenly, as it seems to be, from its ordinary habit 

 of nest-building, is remarkable. But such is the fact, as the 

 mother-bird was discovered in the act of incubation. It has been 

 suggested that possibly these nests were stolen property, and not 

 the work of the bird in question. But this I am satisfied is not 

 the case. The individuals of some species do take forcible pos- 

 session of the abodes of others, or tlie cavities in which such are 

 secreted, but I have never known the intruders to occupy the 

 same, except in the case of Molothrus pecoris, Seo., of America, 

 and Cuculus canorus of England. As these birds never build, 

 but deposit their eggs in the nests of other birds, I am hardly 

 disposed to grant the propriety of considering them in this 

 light. It is well known that Troglodytes sedon, of Yerrill, does, 

 when prompted by a mischievous spirit, drive awa^"" Icterus Balti- 

 more, Daud., and Sayornis fuscus., Baird, from their rightful pro- 

 perty, and take up her abode therein, but not without having 

 previously constructed her rude nest of coarse sticks, well lined 

 with feathers and down. 



So strong is the attachment of birds to the nests of their own 

 construction, that the parental instinct is often lost sight of. 

 Proofs could be cited to sustain this assertion. One, however, 

 will suffice. Two years ago in Atlantic Count}', Xew Jersey, I 

 came across a nest of the robin, which on account of its curious 

 arrangement, I desired to possess. Unable to wait until the un- 

 fledged brood had taken their departure, I conceived the plan of 

 removing them to another nest of the same species, not so neatly 




294 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



constrncted and tastefully arranged. But, as I had anticipated, 

 the mother deserted her offspring ; the love for home predomi- 

 nating over every other feeling. . 



These deviations from the usual style of nest building b3^ the 

 pewee would seem to argue against the belief generally enter- 

 tained, that instinct, being a positive determination given to the 

 minds of animals for certain purposes, must necessarily be perfect, 

 when viewed in connection with those purposes; but to saj-^ that 

 the}' doubtless implj' a change of instinct is to perplex the under- 

 standing b}'' a perversion of language. But to ascribe these 

 changes to the operations of reason influenced b}^ motives, does 

 seem to be the most rational view to take of the subject. That 

 reason does enter into the inferior creatures, and dictate manj^ of 

 the changes of habit which mark their career, has been shown in 

 man}' instances ; but I cannot forbear to record one which came 

 under my observation in the spring of 1871. TThile watching a 

 pair of Ampelis cedrorum, Baird, engaged in the building of a 

 nest on a branch of an apple tree, it occurred to me, that by sup- 

 plying them with materials I might secure a nest neater and more 

 compact than those usually made. The birds entered into the 

 project with readiness, and carried away every piece of colored 

 string and cotton fabric with which I supplied them. After I had 

 ceased to furnish the materials they would fly repeatedly to the 

 branch where the articles were deposited, as if imploring my ser- 

 vices. The result was a nest firmer, more symmetrical, and more 

 elegant in proportions than any I had ever observed. If instinct 

 had been the controlling principle in this case, the birds would 

 not have given my labors so much attention; but admitting that 

 they had been actuated by reasoning faculties in their selection, 

 the whole thing is perfectly plausible. Instinct is always the same 

 thing ; it never advances, never retrogrades ; but reason tends to 

 improvement, when it can serve a good purpose. 



As the nests which form the subject-matter of this paper were 

 found within a short distance of each other, it would seem that 

 circumstances peculiar to the neighborhood had rendered a de- 

 viation from the common form necessary. Observation teaches 

 us that when danger or any other circumstance renders a change 

 in the character of the nest necessary, that deviation is made in 

 an equal degree and in the same manner by all the birds of one 

 species, and that it does not extend beyond the limits of the region 

 where alone it can serve a good purpose.

 the hind femora do not have the black points on the upper margin 

 of the disk ; it does not have the black dots on the ventral seg- 

 ments ; it is also a larger and more robust species, being one of the 

 largest of this genus found in the United States. I should also 

 state that the cerci of the male, though broad as usual with the 

 section of the genus to which this belongs, instead of extending 

 horizontal]}- along the sides, are curved over the apex ; and the 

 sub-anal plate is more than usually elongate, with the apical notch 

 slight!}' rounded. 



The collection was made chiefly b}- Dr. Yarrow, who informs me 

 that the specimens are mostly from southeast Xevada and south- 

 west Utah. There are some other interesting and new species in 

 the collection, which will be described in Lieut. Wheeler's report of

OBSERVATIONS ON THE HABITS OF THE NEUTERS OF FORMICA 

 SANGUINEA. 



BY THOMAS G. GENTRY. 



A few days ago, while engaged in the collection of Coleoptera 

 underneath stones and decaj-ed logs, m}- attention was attracted 

 by a nest of Formica sanguinea. Scattered over the ground to 

 receive the warmth of the sun, were numberless larvae of the ant, 

 in diverse stages of development. Some had apparently just es- 

 caped from the ova, while others were nearly ready to pass into 

 the condition of pupa?. 



Two external apertures of the nest were all that could be dis- 

 cerned leading to chambers below. Many neuters — working ants 

 — were observed performing the duties of nurses to the offspring. 

 On close examination they appeared to be divided into two classes : 

 one having the exclusive charge of the almost mature larvae; the 

 other, the care of the more feeble. 



As is customarj^ with ants in an invasion of their territories, 

 the larvae were removed to places of security. The larger grubs 

 were conveyed to a separate apartment by workers whose special 

 duty it seemed to be ; while the less vigorous were taken posses- 

 sion of by another set, and hidden away in another chamber of 

 the habitation. After the last individual of the former had been 

 cared for, I expected to see the first set come out and assist in the 

 removal of their more tender offspring, that were still Ij'ing pro- 

 fuseh' about. But I was disappointed. With a view to test my 

 observations, I dropped several of these last into the mouth of the 

 first passage-wa}', thinking that possibly the sight of these would 

 stimulate them to furtlier exertions. But all my attempts to draw 

 them out were in vain. These larvae remained where I had placed 

 them, until their own properl}' constituted nurses observed them, 

 when they were immediately seized and carried to appropriate 

 quarters. 



After the tumult had subsided, I opened the horizontal channel 

 that led to the first chamber. It was about two inches in length 

 and half an inch beneath the surface. Here, packed awa}' in a 

 commodious chamber, were a score or more of ants, each with the 

 object of its solicitude by its side. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 299 



Alarmed still more by this second intrusion, eacli seized a larva, 

 studiously avoiding the entrance to the main chamber, and hurried 

 it awaj'' to places of security among the adjoining leaves and 

 grasses. I am confident that the main nest was shunned, as the 

 parties passed within an eighth of an inch of it, and could readily 

 have entered, had there been anj^ such intention. 



The conclusions I have to draw fi'om these facts are the follow- 

 ing: 1st. The colony is divided into two sets of neuters, one 

 whose care it is to provide for the wants and securit^'^ of the abler 

 and more mature, the other to look after the more helpless. 2d. 

 That the more vigorous are necessarily confined to superficial 

 cavities, since they need less care and attention, and in order to 

 avoid the time and trouble of constant removals in consequence 

 of the varied conditions of weather and surrounding circumstances 

 to which they are subjected, said removals seeming to be impracti- 

 cable in view of the weight and size of the fully-grown larvae. 3d. 

 That the young and tender are conveyed to deeper-seated chambers, 

 less likeh" to be assailed by an enemy, thus aftbrding a better means 

 of continuing the species.

Sex in Rhus cotinus. — Mr. Thomas Meehan said Rhus cotinus, 

 the common mist tree, was described as having perfect flowers. 

 In a large quantity of seedlings growing on his grounds he found 

 they were dioecious. There was not mucli novelt}^ in this, as it 

 was now generally conceded that most if not all plants called 

 b}' old botanists pol3'gamons, were practically dioecioiis, for what 

 appeared to be perfect flowers had either the male or female 

 flowers entirely inoperative. But in this case the distinction had 

 a practical value to ornamental planters, for he had found that 

 except in very rare instances only the female plants produced the 

 hairy pedicles known as mist. Occasionally a male panicle of extra 

 viabilit}'' would produce a few short hairs. In general the panicle 

 of male flowers died away as soon as the flowers faded. This 

 fact also illustrated his view of the relative viability of the sexes. 

 One might say of this, as has been said of other illustrations, that 

 of course things die when their work is done. The male having 

 nothing more to do does not need so much vitality as the female, 

 which has to live on, as it has much more work to do. But this 

 reasoning he thought favors his own views, and seems so unanswer- 

 able, that it ought, years ago, to have suggested to some mind 

 the true law of vitality in its relation to sex as it had done to his 

 own. It was enough for him that his facts were self-evident, that 

 there was not as much force spent on the production of male as 

 of female flowers. 



In the production of seed in Rhus cotinus, he also noted that 

 often two carpels were fullj- developed, and in some few cases three, 

 thus forming a three-celled capsule.

 Mr. Gentry made the following remarks : — 



In some genera of Composite plants with ligulate ray and 

 tubular disk florets, the discoid tj'pe has been occasionallj' ob- 

 served in abnormal developments. A case of the kind came 

 under my notice recently, while examining a plant of Ruclheckia 

 hirta, iu which the ray florets were all tubular. The structure of 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 301 



each corolla was found to be identical with those of the disk, dif- 

 fering immaterially in size and color. Fully one-half of these 

 irregular forms were perfect and fertile, whilst the opposite con- 

 dition of affairs prevails in the normal flower. 



On the same day in which the preceding obserTations were 

 made, I noticed other plants of the same species, in which the 

 disk florets had grown to twice the usual magnitude, and had 

 doffed their natural .-hade of brown for the beautiful golden hue 

 so eminentl}' characteristic of the outer circle of florets. Here 

 the essential organs of reproduction had, in a measure, aborted. 

 Upon the principle that excess of growth force has transformed 

 the sterile ray into fertile florets, and the same deficiency has 

 been instrumental in reducing the fertile disk florets alluded to, 

 to a partial state of abortion — a principle so abh' maintained in 

 the writings of Mr. Thomas Meehan — the foregoing facts receive 

 a clear and comprehensive solution. 



Subsequeutl}' I was so fortunate as to find three specimens of 

 fully developed flowers growing upon the same plant, in each of 

 which there was a double series of ray florets having the regular 

 number of florets in each series. These were without exception 

 ligulate and neutral. These secondary series, I think, are the 

 result of the want of vigor necessary to develop fertile florets.

THE PTEROSTICHI OF THE UNITED STATES. 

 BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M.D. 



Since the publication of my synopsis of the species of Pteros- 

 tichus and allied genera inhabiting temperate North America,' 

 the additions to our fauna have been quite appreciable, but what 

 is of greater importance, by the kindness of friends in Europe, 

 authentic specimens have been procured of most of the species 

 which at that time were unknown to me. It has, therefore, ap- 

 peared to me useful to place in a condensed form the results of a 

 more recent study of the species in my collection, in order to 

 facilitate the recognition of the numerous forms in this somewhat 

 difficult genus. 



I have, with greater material and more careful studj^, been 

 obliged to modifj' the generic table given in the work just cited, 

 to such an extent as to place Pcecilus as a minor group of Pteros- 

 tichus, and to elevate Piesmus, on account of its absolutely simple 

 mentum tooth, to the rank of a genus. 



I would, therefore, propose this new scheme of arrangement. 



Mandibles striate ; elytra with one dorsal puncture. Evakthrus. 



Mandibles not striate : 

 jMcutum tooth emarginate : 

 Ligula carinate : 

 Metathoracic episterna long. Lophoglossus. 



Metathoracic episterna short. Holciophorus. 



Ligula not carinate : 

 Front tarsi of % normally dilated. Pterostichus. 



Front tarsi of % obliquely dilated. Loxandkus, 



Mentum tooth entire, rounded at tip. Piesmus. 



It is worthy of remark, that while in Europe manj^ species occur 

 in which the last ventral segment of the % is crested or impressed, 

 four have thus far been found in America. On the Pacific slope 

 Holciophorus ater is the only example, and in the higher parts of 

 the Alleghanies P. mancus, diligendus, and luby^icus.

 wider than long, rounded on the sides, which are strougl}^ margined 

 and towards the base widely depressed ; base a little wider than 

 the apex, straight, margined towards the hind angles, which are 

 obtuse and slightly rounded, basal fovea? short, deep, marked 

 with a few punctures ; elj^tra scarcely sinuate towards the tip, 

 humeri not dentiform, striae deep, punctured, scutellar wanting, 

 but indicated by the usual puncture ; dorsal punctures 3, the 1st 

 on the od, the others on the 2d stria, and less separated than 

 usual; sides of trunk and abdomen punctured ; tarsi not grooved. 

 Long. 10 mm. 



Georgia. A very remarkable species of which I have seen onl}' 

 the specimen kindly communicated b}^ Dr. Horn. 



62. P. LUSTRANs Lee. The specimens of this species from Van- 

 couver Island, "Washington Territory, are larger than those from 

 California, but do not otherwise differ. 



63. P. PENSYLVANicus, vcry shining black in both sexes, pro- 

 thorax with the side margin a little wider towards the base, hind 

 angles dentiform prominent ; elytra with the striae deep, inter- 

 spaces slightlj' convex, 3d with 5 large punctures. Long. 11 mm. 



Mountains of Pennsylvania. This species is closely related to 

 the others of the group, and especially to F. vitreus ; it is, how- 

 ever, rather narrower, more shining in both sexes, and the hind 

 angles of the prothorax are more prominent and dentiform. 



69. P. coRRUscuLUS, elongate, shining black, antennae and legs 

 ferruginous; prothorax a little wider than long, equally narrowed 

 at tip and base, rounded on the sides, hind angles obtuse, not pro- 

 minent, transverse impressions obsolete, basal impressions long 

 and deep, base finely margined each side ; elytra with deep nearly 

 impunctured strife, scutellar distinct, 3d interspace with 3 dorsal 

 punctures. Long. 5 mm. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 



Massachusetts. Mr. P. S. Sprague. Smaller and narrower 

 than P. femoralis^ with the legs entirely ferruginous. In one 

 specimen there is a very faint and small outer basal impression. 



70. Argutor hicolor Kirby, ih. The type agrees with P. patrue- 

 Lis, except that the outer elytral striae are less impressed, and the 

 basal fovese of the prothorax less deep. These differences seem 

 to be individual. 



73. P. viNDiCATUS Mann. As exhibiting the uncertain and opin- 

 ionative character of the species of the Crjobius group, I will give 

 a list of the specimens upon which I have based the table above 

 printed, and the sources from which thej' have been derived. 



86. A. hrevicornis Kirb}', ih. The type seems not distinct from 

 one sjoecimen of A. mandihularis ; the other specimen of the latter 

 is more elongate, more bi'onzed, less convex, with the elytral stri« 

 deeper, and dorsal punctures less evident. These differences do not 

 seem to me specific. P. fastidiosus Mann, is a smaller and stouter 

 race, with the hind angles of the prothorax less defined, and P. 

 ochoHcus an equally small and stout race, with the hind angles 

 more prominent.

SYNONYMICAL REMARKS UPON NORTH AMERICAN COLEOPTERA. 



BY JOHN L. LE CONTE, M.D, 



In tlie Annals and Magazine of Natural History, November, 

 1870, I publislied some notes made during a rapid examination of 

 various collections in London and Paris ; subsequent opportuni- 

 ties enabled me to make some additional notes, and more careful 

 studies of the species which I had not time to investigate on my 

 first visits. These are contained in the present paper, with such 

 corrections of my former notes as seem to be necessary at the pre- 

 sent time. 



1. CiciNDELA LONGiLABRis Say. A specimen labelled Bermuda 

 in the Oxford Museum. 



2. C. Magdalen.^. Marked like cinctipennis Lee, but the pro- 

 thorax is more rugose, the elytra more strongly punctured, and 

 distinctly serrate at tip ; in addition to the usual markings, dilated 

 and connected at the margin, there is a basal white spot (as in 

 macra), and a subsutural white vitta. Oxford Museum ; found 

 in turpentine barrels brought to London, supposed to be from 

 North Carolina. 



I have named this species in friendly recollection of Magdalen 

 College, Oxford, the genial influence of which has been experi- 

 enced by many scientific pilgrims to the University. 



3. C. lacerata Chaud. from Louisiana, scarcely differs from the 

 Mexican C. hamata. 



4. C. pamphila Chaud. An undescribed species from Texas, 

 of stout form, allied to pallifera. Elytra with the dark ^^^^ 

 spaces strongly punctured, tip very finely almost obso- |^PI 

 letely serrate ; last ventral segment 9 longitudinall}' ira- H9H 

 pressed and marked with white spots. I tSI B 



5. Elaphrus americanus Dej. The type in the col- l^nl 

 lection of Baron Chaudoir is evidently the common species H^^l 

 afterwards described by me as piinctatissimus. There 



are many other synonj-ms for the various races which occur in its 

 wide distribution from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and northwards 

 nearly to the Arctic circle. 



6. Notiophilus aquaticus\ Kirby. The tj'pe in the British 

 Museum does not resemble the European species ; it is more brassy 




322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



than siBiRicus, with the stripe of the eh^tra more strongly punc- 

 tured ; the inner rows are less impressed behind ; the dorsal fovea 

 is deep ; the scutellar stria is deep, and there are four or five small 

 punctures between it and the sutural stria. It seems therefore to 

 be N. SEMiSTRiATUS Say. 



t. Xebria (Helobia) castanipes Kirby, afterwards described 

 as N. moesta Lee, and previousl}' as N. Sahlbergi Dej. 



8. Calosoma peregrinator Guerin, Rev. Zool, 1844, p. 255; 

 angulatum Lee, 2^'>^ominens\\ Lee. Resembles lugubre, but is 

 less shining and not so coarsely' punctured. 



9. C. angulatum Chevr. Col. Mex. 1, No. 44. Resembles ex- 

 ternum in form, but differs in the prothorax being angulated at the 

 sides. Mexico. 



10. C. ai-matinn Lap. Etudes Entom. 156 ; C. alternans Fabr. 

 fide Chaudoir. Antilles. 



11. C.fulgidus Gebler, coll. Mnizsech. A varietj' of vieting- 

 Hovii, with the elytra more coarsely reticulate. Alaska. 



12. C. meander Fischer; ia29i7a?/t Lap. ; 2'a^u?7u" Motsch. Ex- 

 tends from North America through Kamtschatka to Siberia. 



13. G. ligatus % Kirby, the type is C. serratus Say. 



14. Cychrus interruptus Men. (coll. Chaudoir) is C. constric- 

 tus Lee. 



15. C. alternatus Motsch. (ibid.) is as large as C. sfriato- 

 ininctatiis Chaud., but the elj^tra are broader, and the prothorax 

 a trifle narrower, with the hind angles more distinctly margined 

 behind ; the specimens are 9, and they seem to belong to the large 

 one having only two joints of the % fi'ont tarsi spongy beneath. 



16. Cymindis marginata Kirby; refiexa Lee; cribricollis 

 Dej.! 



17. C. unicolor Kirby is a small immature specimen of C. hud- 

 sonica Lee. ; the sides of the prothorax are more widely margined 

 than in pilosa, distinctly sinuate behind, and the hind angles are 

 prominent. 



18. C. VENATOR Dej., according to Baron Chaudoir differs from 

 AMERICANA Dej. M}' scrics is not sufliciently large to decide this 

 point. 



19. A specimen of Trichothorax cyaneus Montr., from New 

 Caledonia, in the collection of Mr. Perroud at Lyons, is very simi- 

 lar to the variety of our Rhombodera pallipes in which the pro- 

 thorax and legs are yellow. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 326 



20. Anchovienus angusficoUis'l Kirby agrees with the common 

 race of Platynl's sixuatus, except that the basal augles of the 

 prothorax are less promhient, the basal impressions and the eljtral 

 striae less punctured. The specimen of P. stygicus Lee. shown 

 me on a former visit to the British Museum was erroneously 

 labelled, but was not Kirbj^'s type; the S3-non3'm given in Annals 

 and Magazine of Xat. History, Xov. 1870, p. Xo. 5, is therefore 

 incorrect. 



21. A. extensicollis. Mr. Kii'by's specimens belong to the 

 elongate bluish-green race, without any elevation in the basal im- 

 pressions of the prothorax. 



22. Agonum affine Kirby is Eart-isii Lee. 



23. A. picipexne Kirby. Yar. (a) is a species as large as P. RU- 

 FicoRNis Lee, with the prothorax equally elongate, and the sides 

 not explanate or reflexed ; it seems to be lutulentus Lee. 



24. A. picijyenne, vars. (c and d) are ruficornis Lec. 



25. A. sordens Kirby, (a) could not be found ; (b) seems to be 

 fuscescens Chaud. 



26. A. SEMiNiTiDL'M Kirby. I learn from Mr. 0. 0. Waterhouse 

 that this species differs from P. chalceus Lec. by the elytra being 

 shorter, more shining, and less parallel at the sides. 



2T. Stereocerus similis Kirby, is the species of Amara described 



as FeRONIA HiEMATOPUS Dej. 



28. Cyrtonotus rufimanus Kirby has the sides of the prothorax 

 distinctl}' sinuate behind, and the hind angles prominent. It 

 seems (without comparison) to be J. lacustris Lec. C. brevila- 

 6?'is Kirby is a specimen of the same species with the labrum 

 retracted under the epistoma. 



29. C.convexiuscidus X Kirby is A. laticollis Lec. The Euro- 

 pean species is narrower, with the prothorax much more narrowed 

 behind and more sinuate on the sides, as in A. Jacobins Lee. 



30. C. latior Kirbj' is A. libera Lec., = lasvisfriata Putzej's, 

 a Bradj'tus with sides of prothorax rounded, hind angles obtuse 

 and not rounded. 



31. Amara iMPrxcTicoLLis Sa}-. Mr. Kirby's specimens have 

 the sides of the prothorax more oblique and less rounded, and the 

 basal foveae more distinct than in the specimens sent b}^ Mr. 

 Sprague for comparison, but I do not think that it is a different 

 species. 



82. A. vulgaris | Kirby, is a rather elongate flattened species 




324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



with the basal foveve of the prothorax double, distinct, and well 

 separated, veiy feebly punctured ; elytra strongly sinuate towards 

 the tip; hind tibia % slightly curved, not pubescent on the inner 

 face. It is of the size of interstitialis, and very nearly related to 

 it, but more depressed, and with deeper prothoracic basal foveie, 

 and seems to be what I incorrectly determined as l^evipennis 

 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 1855, 353. 



33. A. discoi^s Kirby = chalcea Dej., has the hind angles of the 

 prothorax sharply defined, the base of the prothorax is not punc- 

 tured, and the sides not explanate ; it seems therefore to be A. 

 CHALCEA Dej. 



34. A. L^viPENNis Kirby is a small species of bright bronze 

 color, with the sides of the prothorax not explanate, basal foveae 

 distinct, strife of elytra fine, not deeper behind ; antennae appa- 

 rently entirely black, hind tibiae 9 not pubescent on inner side. 

 Size of European A. oommunIs, but quite distinct. I have de- 

 scribed this species as erratica Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. 1855, 353. 



35. A. PALLiPES Kirby. Correctly determined in ray cabinet. 

 Narrower and more convex than angustata Say, with the basal 

 fovese \Q,ry distinct. 



36. Isopleurus nitidus \\ Kirby is Amara sub^nea Lee. The 

 mentum tooth is not emarginate and but slightly impressed at tip. 



37. I. MACLEAYi Kirby is a Selenophorus allied to S. stigmosus 

 but with the basal angles of prothorax rectangular. Probably 

 from the Antilles, certainly not East Indian. 



38. MiscoDERA AMERICANA Mann. (coll. Chaudoir) is very simi- 

 lar to M. Hardyi Chaud., but is smaller, more bronzed, with more 

 globose and narrower prothorax, and elytral strise still more 

 obliterated. 



39. Dictelus scijlptilis Say. The more convex and shining 

 northern race of this species has been named intricatus by Baron 

 Chaudoir. 



40. D. ambiguus Ferte, not different from opacus Ferte, and 

 refiexus Lee. 



41. Badi&ter peltatusXJie]. The insect mentioned as the Ameri- 

 can varietj^ of this species is B. flavipes Lee. 



42. LiciNUs siLPHOiDES. Two specimens of this insect from 

 North American turpentine are in the Oxford Museum. I have 

 seen several which were taken alive in Massachusetts ; so that it 

 must be regarded as fairly introduced into our fauna.

44. G. emarginatus | Kirby, could not be found.

47. C. cordicollis Kirby is G. chlorophanus'l Lee. = C. Le-

48. G. quadricollis Kirby is a green variety of tricolor, and 

 not brevilabris Lee, which is not among Kirby's specimens. 



49. PoLPocHiLE Sol. = J/eZanof us II Dej. = Cra^ocara Lee. :=

50. Earp)alus lalicollis Kirby on comparison proves to be Ani- 

 soDACTYLUs NiGERRiMus Dej., and not A. Harrisii Lee. as incor- 

 rectly stated by me in Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. 



51. H. INTERPUNCTATUS Kirby is the species which I have de- 

 termined (New Species p. 15) as A. nigrita Dej., but which Baron 

 Chaudoir considers different, and has named A. Lecontei. 



52. H. ocHROPTJS Kirby agrees with desertus Lee, except that 

 the hind angles of the prothorax are nearly impunctate. 



.53. H. BASiLLARis Kirby is obesulus Lee. and = Amai^a externa

54. DicHiRUS BRUNNEUS Dej. (coll. Chaudoir) is like piceus in 

 form, but smaller, with the hind angles of the prothorax rectan- 

 gular and slightly prominent. 



55. Trechus similis Kirby is the common Agonoderus, with 

 the hind angles of the prothorax rounded ; comma Fabr. (fide 

 Zimm. pallipes'l Say, Dej.) 



56. T. jiavipes Kirby is Bradycellus rupestris (Say). 



57. T. ruficrus Kirby is B. cognatus, as correctly observed by 

 Baron Chaudoir. 



58. T. immunis Kirby is Stenolophus conjunctus (Sa}-). 



59. Peryphus concolor Kirby. On renewed examination this 

 appears to be Bembidiuvi salebratum Lee. 



60. Peryphus picipes Kirby. The specimen is in bad condi- 

 tion, but seems to be of revy convex form. It is smaller than 

 79-78 Sprague, and has the elytral striae very finely punctured. 



61. P. scopuLiNUS Kirby is B. gelidum Lee. 



62. Notajjhus variegatus\\ Kirby is not versicolor Lee, but a 




326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



smaller species with more convex prothorax more narrowed at the 

 base ; it seems to be B. pictum Lee. 



63. N. iNTERMEDius Kirby of the same size as versicolor, but 

 with the sides of the prothoi'ax distinctly sinuate near the base ; 

 seems to be B. rapidum Lee. 



64. N. NiGRiPES Kirby, very similar to intermedius, but nearly 

 black, with small pale s^jots and dark legs. 



65. Taclnjta picipes Kirby is T. inornatus (Say) =^ T. nanus 

 of Europe, as correctl}^ determined by Schaum, Ins. Deutschl. i. 



66. Haliplus pantherinus Aube. The type in the British Mu- 

 seum is a small siDecies resembling immaculicollis in size and 

 color. 



67. CoLPius INFLATUS IjQQ. = SxipMs Doubledayi B. M. Cat. 



68. SuPHis Forsteri^ B. M. Cat., size of gibbulus, but the 

 elytra are veiy strongly punctured. 



69. Hydrocanthus Harrisii^. B. M. Cat., size of gibbulus, 

 but narrower, with the el^'tra black, finely and obsoletel}' punc- 

 tured. 



70. Colymbetes ph.^opterus Kirb3\ % with the last joint of 

 front tarsi not deformed ; ? sides of prothorax finely margined, 

 very slightly rounded, scarcel}'- forming an angle with the el3'tra, 

 very finely reticulate, somewhat dull ; elytra very finely granulato- 

 reticulate, and sparsel}- punctulate. 



71. C. bicolor Kirby. More regularly elliptical and convex 

 than the preceding, also finel}'' granulato-reticulate, but scarcely 

 punctulate, prothorax similar in form, but not more reticulate in 

 9 than % ; el^'tra pale towards the sides. Both species are allied 

 to Agabus discolor. 



72. C. retigulatus Kirby is allied to Agabus arcticus of 

 Europe. 



73. Colymbetes sinuatus Lee. should be compared with the 

 European C. Graph, which it closely resembles. 



74. Acilius llaccullochii Kirby is mediatus Say. 



75. Hydroporus exiguus Aube. Nothing like this is in our 

 collections. 



76. Xecrophorus melsheimeri Kirb}', evidently the form 

 named infodiens Mann. The prothorax is as in niaritimus of 

 which it is a variety ; antennae with the base of the club black, 

 remaining joints red ; el3'tra with two bands and epipleurae red. 



77. N. Hallii Kirby is orbicollis Say. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 



TS. N. Jiebes Kirby is a variet}^ of vespilloides ; the protborax 

 is as in maritimus, club of antennae entirel}^ black, elytra with two 

 bands, the front one extending forwards on the epipleurse to the 

 humeri, leaving a black portion behind the humerus on the upper 

 side of the epipleura. 



79. Leiodes punctostriatus Kirby has the hind tarsi 4-jointed, 

 and is therefore an Anisotoma, and not Hydnobius, as incorrectly 

 stated by Erichson. The punctures of the rows are very large, 

 and those of the alternate spaces also large. 



80. Pselaphodes Westwood is allied to Tmesiphorus, but 

 differs in form of palpi. 



81. Sintectus Westwood equals Tmesiphorus Lee. The Aus- 

 tralian species closely resembles T. costalis Lee. 



82. Aleochara pallitarsis Kirby is a rather large black Ho- 

 malota, with the prothorax broadly impressed near the base, and 

 feebly channelled ; elytra brownish, a little wider than prothorax, 

 finely not densely punctulate and pubescent; abdomen dorsal 

 surface shining, not strongl}'' punctured ; antenn£E heavy, black, 

 2d and 3d joints each more than ^ longer than 4th ; scape stouter 

 and a little longer than the 2d. A common species. 



83. Tachyporus acuductus Kirby is ventriculus Say ; the right 

 elytron is striated and rugose towards the tip, but the left is uni- 

 formly finely punctulate. 



84. T. AFFiNis Kirby is nearly of the same form, but less con- 

 vex; the prothorax very finely, and the elytra very strougl}^ punc- 

 tulate. 



85. Omalium planipenne Miiklin is 0. 2^inefi Thomson. 



86. DiSTEMMUS ARGUS is vcry similar to and perhaps identical 

 with a European species of Omalium. 



87. Omalium marginatum Kirby is an Olophrum with the pro- 

 thorax sparsely and coarsely punctured, slightlj' narrowed behind, 

 hind angles obtuse but distinct, disk moderately convex; elytra 

 very strongly punctured, nearly as long as the abdomen. De- 

 scribed bj' Maeklin under the same name. 



88. 0. sanguineuni and 2oerocellatum\. B. M., from Hudson Bay, 

 are allied to 0. convexicolle Lee. 



89. Acidota seriata Lee. is crenata (Fabr.) according to Miiklin,

 continent. 



90. N. DiscoiDEA Fabr., Kirby seems to be the Californian 

 Omosita inversa Lee, but the northern specimens are smaller. 



91. Epur^a BOREELLAEr., a small narrow black species similar 

 to NIGRA Maklin, common to Europe and North America. 



92. EuROPS Wollaston is KomojMoeus Lee. 



93. Hesperob^nus testaceus| Motsch. is a species of Bactri- 

 dium, broader than B. nanum and uniformlj^ testaceous. 



94. Atomaria atra\ Kirby is a small convex shining coarsely 

 punctured species; eljtra testaceous, legs and abdomen pale 3'el- 

 low. Probabl}' a dark variety of A. l^tula Lee, and not at all 

 like the European A. atra. 



95. Anchomma Lee. Compare with Microtelus Sol. Ann. Ent. 

 Tr., 1838, pi. 1, f. 3. 



96. Corticaria denticulata Kirby is quite different from C. 

 Serrata of the same collection ; it is smaller, nearly black, pro- 

 thorax broadly and deeply foveate near the base, sides much 

 rounded, regularly and less coarselj' serrate. 



97. LoBERUS Lee. ; a species of this genus from Chili is in the 

 British Museum. 



98. Catogenus PUNCicoLLisNewm. is not in the British Museum. 



99. Penthelispa Pascoe (Oct. 1860) is Endectus Lee. (Maj-, 

 1861). 



100. Minthea Pascoe seems allied to Trogoxylon Lee. 



101. Hemipeplus marginipennis Lee. seems to be Oclirosanis 

 Dohrnii Pascoe, 1866. 



102. Elacatis\\ Pascoe (1860), is Othnius Lee. (1861.) The 

 geographical distribution of this genus is very remarkable ; Borneo 

 and United States. 



103. Thorictus; I saw in Mr. Salle's collection the onl}^ repre- 

 sentative of this family thus far found in America ; a small species 

 collected in San Domingo. 



104. Byrrhus picipes Kirb}-, a rather large species with a trans- 

 verse submarginal black spot on the elytra behind the middle. It 

 is correct!}^ determined in my synopsis. 



105. Dichelonycha virescens Kirby is the common northern 

 species with the prothorax tolerably densely punctured, thinly 

 pubescent, feebly channelled ; the lateral angles are distinct, the

 of my sj'nopsis, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sc, 2d. ser. iii. 279. 



106. Melolontha paradoxa Beauvois, according to Salle, is 

 RhilJidandrus fiahellicornis (Sturm). 



lOT. The Australian genera Phtllotocus and Macrothops Mc- 

 Leay are related to Oncerus Lee. in form and b}- the double 

 epistoma. 



108. Cheiragra McLeay from Australia is allied to Chnaunan- 

 THUS Burm. and Acratus Horn. The position of the spii-acles 

 must be observed in these genera to determine their true affinities. 



109. Liogenys, Homalochilus, and Hilarianus have the proj)}-- 

 gidium connate with the fifth ventral as in Diplotaxis, which the}* 

 resemble in form and sculpture. 



110. Htpotrichia Lee. and Plectrodes Horn agree in form and 

 general characters with Clavipalpus, but the last diflers in having 

 the ungues alike, and armed with a broad acute tooth. The pro- 

 P3-gidium is connate with the fifth ventral and the spiracle is placed 

 on the connecting suture; the fifth ventral is elongated. 



111. LErRETRA Er. resembles Clavipalpus by the fifth ventral 

 being elongated, but the mouth organs are less developed, as in 

 other Pachj'podidaB, with which the three genera mentioned in 110 

 must probably be associated. 



112. Diplotaxis Georgia Blanchard (Paris Museum) is similar 

 to D. SUBCOSTATA Blauch. but larger, with the prothorax more 

 sparsely and coarsely punctured, and the interspaces of the elytra 

 flatter and not subcostate behind. D. moesta of the same collec- 

 tion seems only an individual variation of subcostata, larger 

 than usual, with the punctures of the occiput and prothorax more 

 feeble. 



113. D. Harperi Blanch, is allied to excavata, but is ferrugi- 

 nous, with the epistoma rounded, not at all truncate, and frontal 

 carina impressed at the middle. 



114. D. ffondicola | Blanch, is also allied to excavata. black, 

 with the elytra a little more rugoseh' punctured ; seems onh- an 

 individual variety. 



115. D. ininctato-rugosa Blanch, is excavata Lee. The form 

 is not "bre%'iter ovata" as described, and the upper tooth of the 

 front tlbice is feeble. The description being erroneous, the name 

 should be dropped into synonym}'.

131. A. jnlosicolis Knoch, is the race of L. tristis (Fabr.), with 

 the pubescence of the elytra longer than usual. 



132. Cremastochilus Harrisii Kirby (Mus. Oxon.) has the 

 prolhorax shining, the front angles are rounded and auriculate, the 

 sides are deepl}' impressed behind the front angles ; the hind angles 

 are not much retracted, surrounded b}* a deep sulcus; there is a 

 patch of hair on the disk each side in front of the hind angles ; the 

 mentum is deeply notched behind. 



133. Mj' notes on Buprestidae from the types of Gory and 

 Laporte, now in the collection of Count Mniszech in Paris, have 

 been partly utilized b}' Mr. Crotch in his "Notes on the species 

 of Buprestidae found in the United States" (Proc. Acad. Nat. 

 Sc. Phil. 1873, p. 84). But it remains for me hei'e to express the 

 great obligations I am under to Count Mniszech, and to the other 

 possessors of types which I had occasion to study, for the facilities

for comparison and the great personal kindness extended to me 

 during m3' short visits to the larger cities of Europe. 



134. DiCERCA OBSCURA (Fab?'.) Lee. is B. lurida and consimilis 

 Gory and Laporte. 



I3.^. D. hilaris Lee. 9 ; manca Lee. % , is tuberculata G. and L. 



136. D. distinguexda G. and L. is colored like hilaris, but 

 stouter, with the hind angles of prothorax less prolonged ; pro- 

 babh' a bright % specimen of D. tenebrosa Kirby. 



137. D. PRUixosA G. and L. resembles lurida, but the prothorax

 L. and G. from Caj'enne, and is probably from South America. 



153. C. Alabamse Gory is similar to the ordinary race of femo- 

 rata, but the prothorax is more narrowed behind and more deepl}' 

 channelled ; G. nigritula Gory is similar but more deeply punctured". 




332 PROOEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



C. difficilis Gory is also similar, but with the hinder impression of 

 the elytra more sinuated, and is = rugoHiceps Mels. 



154. C. ignipes Gory is sexsignata (Say). 



155. G. Germari Gory seems to be a variet}^ of the Mexican C. 

 SoLiERi, and has not occurred thus far in the United States. 



156. C. FEMORATA (Fabr.) coll. Dej. is viridiceps Mels. 



15Y. G. viridipunctata Gory is a variety of hybernata in which 

 the metallic green spot at the base of the elytra extends bej'ond

 and G. 



159. G. rugosula Gory is Actenodes acornis (Say). 



160. Actenodes bella Lee. does not differ from aureonotata 

 Gor^^, found in Cuba and South America ; the locality of the 

 specimen collected in Georgia is absolutely correct. 



161. G. basalis Lee. is atabalipa Gory and Golobagaster multi. 

 stigmosa Mann. 



162. C. Lesueurt Gory is soro7^ Lee. 



163. G.fastidiosa Gory is Lesueu7'i J Lee. 



164. G. quodriipressa Gory misella Lee. is a small variety of 

 this species. 



165. G. nigrofasciata J Lee, Tr. Am. Phil. Soc, xi., 240, is quite 

 difierent from the Mexican species, and from melazona Gory ; it 

 may therefore be named atripasciata. 



166. Polycesta obtusa Lee. seems to be velasco L. and G. ; there 

 is an error iu the reference to the plate in my paper, it should be 

 fig. 6, not 7. 



167. AcM^ODERA MIMA Gory is semimttata Lee. 



168. A. PULCHELLA (Hcrbst.) Gory and dispar Gory are A.

173. CoR^EBUS CALiGiNOSus Gory is a South American species. 



174. Agrilus nigricans Gory, size of ruficollis, finely punc- 

 tured, hind angles of thorax scarcely carinate. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 333 



1T5. A. prLCHELLUs Bland; I sa-^v a specimen of this species 

 from Texas, in the collection of Mr. Perroud, at Lj'ons ; and in 

 the same collection I saw two new species: 1, larger than acuti- 

 PENNis, bronzed, coarsel}' punctnred, hind angles of prothorax 

 acutely carinated ; 2, larger and stouter than muticus Lee, more 

 shining, bright green.

180. B. PR^TEXTA Gory is the small black species resembling 



TESSELATA. 



181. Phlegon HERCULEANrs Lacordaire is South American, and 

 must therefore be stricken from the List. 



182. Adelocera sparsa Cand., quite distinct; not uncommon 

 in California. 



183. A. PROFUSA Cand., is cavicoUis Lee. 



184. Meristhus scobinula Cand. The Chinese specimens have 

 the scutellum ver}- strongly and acutely carinate ; in the Mexican 

 it is finel}^ carinate, and in both the sides of the prothorax and 

 the basal edge are not serrate. 



185. Alans gorgops Lee. is El. ltjsciosus Hope, Griff. An. Kingd., 

 363. pi. 31. 



186. Perimecus similis Kirby, size of M. communis, but a little 

 narrower ; prothorax more coarsely and sparsely punctured, 

 scarcely impressed behind ; third joint of antennae narrower and 

 shorter than fourtli, about twice as long, but scarcely wider than 

 second ; hind angles of prothorax bicarinate. 



187. Melanactes piceus. In the Oxford Museum I saw two 

 specimens from the Lee collection labelled E. aterrimus Fabr. and 

 one E. lacunosus Fabr. 



188. Odontonyx. There is a beautiful species of this genus 

 from China in the Oxford Museum, in which the % has the anten-

189. Telephorus mandibularis Kirby, is the smaller black 

 species, with the prothorax more convex and feebh^ channelled, 

 and the lustre obscured by verv fine hairs. T. fraxini Say is 

 larger and has the prothorax more polished, and more deeplj- 

 impressed. 



190. Dasttes foveicollis Kirby belongs to Psilothrix. 




334 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



191. Tillus picipennis White, B. M. Cat., from India, is the cos- 

 mopolitan Tarsostenus univittatus. 



192. Hydnocera rufipes Newm. is a beautiful blue species, of 

 the same form as humeralis, with, the elytra ver}-^ coarsely- but 

 not densel}- punctured, mouth, antennae, and legs bright reddish- 

 yellow. 



193. H. ^GRA Newm. Quite distinct from any species in our 

 collections. The prothorax is narrowed behind, constricted at 

 each end ; eljtra shining, strongly' punctured. 



194. Driamerus Solier from Chili resembles stronglj^ and is 

 perhaps congeneric with Melyris cribratus Lee. 



195. The Australian genus Omma Newm. is evidently allied to 

 CxjPES, especially to C- serrata Lee, and is one of those curious 

 examples of geographical distribution, of which we have already 

 instances in Derataphrus, Nyctoports, and Tmesiphorus. A 

 species of Cupes occurs in Japan, wiiich, on the other hand, re- 

 sembles C. CONCOLOR from the Atlantic States. 



196. Stagetus Wollaston should be compared with Protheca 

 Lee. The resemblances between the Coleopterous fauna of North 

 America and the Atlantic Islands are neither few nor unim- 

 portant. 



197. Lebasiella pallipes King is nigripennis Lee, a Mexican 

 species to be stricken from the list. 



198. Nyctipetus. One of the most extraordinary instances that 

 I have noticed, of resemblance which, if connected by geographi- 

 cal coincidence, would be termed mimicr}', is between a Chilian 

 species of this genus, living in arid plains, and Amphizoa Le- 

 CONTEI Matthews, a subaquatic adephage found in Vancouver and 

 Utah. 



199. Emeax sculpturatus Pascoe, from Australia, is a species 

 of Nyctoporis, barely- different from N. galeata Lee, which is 

 found at San Diego, California, b}' the humeri hemg not dentiform^ 

 though the hind angles of the prothorax are rectangular and

204. E. conjuncta and conveocicollis Walker are obscura (Saj^). 

 206. Exerestus Bates is Rhinandrus Lee. (1862): E. Jansoni 



Bates is R. elongatus Horn, from Nicaragua. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 



206. Polijpleuriis geminatus 4-Dej. according to the types iu 

 Mr. F. Bates's collectiou, is the smaller species with narrower 

 prothorax. 



207. According to Mr. F.Bates the genera Calcar, Zolodinus, 

 and Centorus are exceptions to the ordinary structure of the ventral 

 segments in the allied genera, the hind margin of the segments 

 not being membranous, but entirely corneous, as in Asididje. 



208. Tenebrio castaneus, as pointed out to me b}' Mr. Bates, 

 agrees with the genera just named in the ventral segments being 

 entirely corneous, but is peculiar in having the e^es complete!}' 

 divided by the eyes as in Blapstinus. It evidently' indicates a new 

 genus, to be associated with the others as a distinct tribe, Cal- 



CARINI. 



209. Pachyurous ^reus (Mels.) seems to be Encyalesthes 

 hrevicornis Motsch., found in Java, Gilola, Mala^'sia ; it is there- 

 fore to be stricken from the list. 



210. Ephalus Lee. does not in the least resemble Leichenum, 

 with which it is united by Gemminger and Harold. 



211. Rhipidandrus Lee. I have seen a species from Guada- 

 loupe in the collection of Mr. Salle, to whom I am indebted for 

 the remark that Melolontha paradoxa Beauv. is the same as 

 R. jiabellicornis. Vide Xo. lOG. 



212. IcTiSTYGMA Pascoe, froiu Australia, seems hardly different 

 from Eurygenius. 



213. IscHALiA Pascoe (1860) is Eupleurida Lee. (1862). The 

 Korth American species diflers from the Bornean one chiefly in 

 color, the latter being of a uniform indigo color, while the former 

 is black and yellow. 



214. llacratria linearis Newra. The base of the prothorax is 

 not narrower than the widest part in front of the middle, and the 

 species does not seem to differ from the common M. murina. 



215. EusTROPHUS BicOLOR. The proper authority for this species 

 is Saj', the first describer; Mycetopho.gus bicolor Fabr. is probabl}' 

 a Platydema. 



215a. ScRAPTiA. Several allied foreign genera have the eyes 

 hairy like Xjdophilus, Stereopalpus, etc. 



216. Anaspis collaris Lee. should be compared with the Euro- 

 pean A. RUFICOLLIS. 



217. Toposcopus Lee. I saw in the collection of Mr. Fry an 

 Austi'alian species of this genus, and also a new genus having

like it divided eyes, but of broader form, with the ramus of third 

 antennal joint as long as the others. 



218. Meloe impressa Kirb}-; the prothorax is a little longer 

 than broad, dull, sparsely jjunctured, elytra deeply rugose; color 

 dark blue ; % with the antennae irregular. 



219. M. NIGRA Kirb}'. Quite different, prothorax shorter, more 

 convex, more punctured, head also more punctured, elj'^tra less 

 deeply rugose, abdomen extremel}'^ finely rugose ; color nearly 

 black. 



220. Apate (Lepisomus) rufipennis and nigriceps Kirby are 

 specimens of Poh^graphus. 



221. A. {L.) hrevicornis Kirby is in such bad condition as to 

 be not recognizable. 



222. Cerambycid^. My notes on this family have been em- 

 ployed in the parts of the classification, New Species, and List 

 of Xorth America Coleoptera relating to this family, with the ex-

ON TWO NEW SPECIES OF SAURODONTIDai. 

 • BY E. D. COPE, A.M. 



POETHEUS LESTRIO, Cope. 



Represented by a portion of the cranium, including both man- 

 dibular rami, and the maxillarj'' and premaxillar}^ bones of one 

 side, all with dentition nearly complete. The size of these parts 

 considerably exceeds that of corresponding ones in tlie two other 

 species of the genus, and indicates a large and powerful fish. It 

 differs from the P. violossus and P. thaumas,^ in having three pre- 

 maxillary teeth instead of two, and in the relative positions, num- 

 bers, and sizes of the other teeth ; also in the prominent edentulous 

 superior distal extremity of the dentar^^ bone. 



The first premaxillary is very large, the two others of moderate 

 size. These are followed by a long rugose diastema before the 

 maxillary teeth begin; these are, one small, five large, twenty-two 

 small, and eleven or twelve very small. The mandibular teeth 

 are, one very large, one immense, one small, one medium, four 

 small, eight large, and two small; total eighteen. The teeth are 

 all simply round or oval in section, and the external, probablj'- 

 cementum la^'er, is smooth. The maxillary bone has two large 

 superior proximal cond3-les, separated by a space ; the anterior is 

 the narrower, and is directly behind the premaxillary condyle. 

 The anterior margin of the latter bone is very rugose.

338 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



If of the same proportions as the P. molossus, the vertical 

 diameter of the head of this fish would be twentj'-three inches. 



A complete cranium of a Portheus^ probably the P. molossus, 

 for which I am indebted to my friend Professor Merrill, of Lincoln 

 Universit}', at Topeka, Kansas, furnishes several points of interest 

 previously unknown. The mouth is nearly vertical, somewhat as 

 in Osmeroides, while the vertex is surmounted b}' an elevated crest. 

 Hence the superior and inferior facial outlines meet at a right angle 

 at the muzzle. The orbit is small, and there is a suborbital chain 

 of laminiform bones. The elevation of the skull is 16.75 inches, 

 while the length is onlj^ 12.75 inches. 



The specimen of P. Jesti^is was procured by Professor B. F. 

 Mudge, of Manhattan, Kansas, during his survej' of 1872, near 

 the Solomon River. Prof. Merrill's specimen was obtained from 

 the same region. 



PORTHETJS GLADIUS, Cope. 



Established on a spine of the kind which I have supposed to be 

 pectoral, and which resembles one I have described (loc. cit., p. 

 332) as from P. molossus or P. thaumas. It is, however, relatively 

 much thicker than that one, and absolutely much larger, and might 

 pertain to the P. lesh-is, but there is no evidence to that eftcct. 



When complete, the spine measured, according to Professor 

 Mudge, fortj'-one inches in length ; the portion now before me 

 measures thirty-one inches. The margin is exceedingh* acute and 

 is coated with an enamel-like layer, which conceals the rods of 

 which the spine is composed. Xear the middle of its length these 

 rods number thirty, but whether the entire width is preserved is 

 uncertain. The transverse section is a crescent from the base to 

 beyond the middle, the surface being thus somewhat trough-like. 

 The spine has been somewhat distorted by pressure, but I cannot 

 discover that the form in question is entirel}' due to that cause. 

 The edge is excavated and notched at irregular points, indicating 

 the frequent use to which this formidable weapon was put during 

 the life of its possessor.

DAPTINUS, Cope, gen. nov. 



This genus is proposed for the Samocephalus phlebotomies, Cope. 



The form of the crowns of the teeth is that of SamocejjJialus and 

 Erisichthe, but it differs from the latter in their perfect equality of 

 size. It diflers from the former in the position of the nutritious 

 foramina of the inner side«of the dentary bone, for instead of form- 

 ing an independent series as in that genus, they only appear as 

 notches on the inner margins of the alveoli. But one species is 

 known as above, which is from the Xiobrara cretaceous of Kansas.

ON SOME NEW BATRACHIA AND FISHES FROM THE COAL MEASURES 

 OF LINTON, OHIO. 



BY E. D. COPE, A.M. 



The following descriptions of sonae interesting forms are pub- 

 lished by permission of Prof. John S. Newberr}*, who procured the 

 specimens in the course of the geological surve3^ of Ohio, of which 

 he is director. 



LEPTOPHRACTXJS, Cope, gen. nov. 



Established on various portions of the cranium of a large Ba- 

 trachian allied to the Lahyrinthodontia. The top of the head is 

 covered with angular plates or scuta arranged in the following 

 manner on the region preserved. Two symmetrical scuta occupy 

 the median line, one in front of the other. One of these is a 

 longish or coffin-shaped hexagonal, with the suture with the other 

 concave. The latter is more ovoid, broad and convex next the 

 first mentioned, and somewhat more contracted at the opposite 

 extremit}'. Beyond this are two shields joining by a straight 

 suture on the middle line; besides this one,- they have two con- 

 cave sutures for scuta, at the farther end two concave lateral 

 sutures, and a straight one to the adjoining median scutum, whose 

 suture is also concave. On each side of this median plate is a 

 large area surrounded before, outwards, and behind hy smaller 

 scuta, three in front, two at the side, and two behind. Commenc- 

 ing with the first, No. 1 has been already described ; No. 2 is small, 

 oval, and antero-posterior ; No. 3 is an antero-posterior pentagon 

 with the uarrow'est side inwards; No. 4 is a similar transverse 

 pentagon ; No. 6 is an antero-posterior pentagon which presents its 

 shorter lateral facet inwards; No. 6 has a similar character, but is 

 smaller and with more definite angles. Another series of scuta is 

 seen outside of these at one end of the series. Three of this set 

 bound the front and side of each of the median pair above men- 

 tioned, leaving a short facet next its fellow unaccounted for. 



The sculpture consists of radiating ridges and tubercles which 

 are most broken near the centres of the scuta. 



The teeth are rather distantly grooved for some distance above 

 the base. They are of different sizes ; the smaller are compressed 

 and with fore and aft cutting edges. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 3-41 



This type is weaker and more slender than Labj-riuthodon, and 

 the cranial scuta appear to be very thin. It is possible that this 

 part of the specimen may only be a cast, but I am not satisfied of 

 this. 



LEPTOPHRACTTJS OBSOLETTJS, Cope, spec. nov. 



The tubercles and ridges of the cranium are obtuse and low, and 

 the latter do not inosculate. An angular depression commences 

 at the middle of each lateral area and extends across the middle 

 line at the point of junction of the paired and single median scuta. 



The external surface of the dentary bone is marked with short 

 oblique grooves along its middle region ; above these are grooves 

 which inosculate, forming a figure like an open net dragged in the 

 long direction. Excepting the grooves the teeth are smooth. The 

 smaller ones are close together, and their crowns are curved back- 

 wards; the larger ones are at more remote intervals; both have 

 enlarged bases ; whether both forms are in the same series I can- 

 not determine. There are from four to five of the smaller in an 

 inch.

Some vertebras were found at the same localit}', but there is no 

 evidence as to the species to which the}^ ma}'' have pertained. They 

 are short, concave on one end and probabl^^ so on tlie other. The 

 centrum of one is .012 in. in diameter; neural arches injured. 



The Leptophr actus was about as large as a medium sized 

 alligator. 



CONCHIOPSIS, Cope. 



This genus is represented by specimens of several species which 

 all agree in the structure of the scales. These resemble those of 

 the Gyroptychius of McCoy, in having longitudinal curved ridges, 

 which converge to the posterior margin round an imaginar}"^ axis. 

 A rather complete specimen which may be regarded as tj-^je, has 

 two dorsal fins and one anal ; neither these nor the ventrals are 

 clearly lobate. The caudal fin is equally developed above and 




342 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



below the tapering vertebral column. It is broken off in the tj-pe, 

 but in another specimen is evidently quite elongate, and of the 

 protocercal or isocercal type. There are two liuge oval gular 

 plates, as I suppose them to be, which are well separated from each 

 other and of a broadly oval form. 



In another specimen the dentition of one of the jaws is exhibited 

 as a douV)le series of small, subcqual, subconical crowns. In still 

 another the pectoral fin is displayed as broadly and obtusely 

 lobate. Whether these all belong to the same genus may be un- 

 certain, but their resemblance is ver^' close. Size not large. The 

 genus is evidently allied to the Cyclodipieridse. 



CONCHIOPSIS FILIFERUS, Cope. 



About twelve rows of scales between the dorsal and ventral fins, 

 which stand opposed to each other, and half way between the gular 

 shields and the line of the equally opposite second dorsal and ven- 

 tral. Sculpture of the gular plates, a longitudinal thread-like rib- 

 bing parallel to the inner borders.

CONCHIOPSIS ANGTJLIFERTJS, Cope. 



Established on a specimen of larger size thau the last species, 

 but in which the scales are similar and therefore relativel}'^ smaller. 

 The gular plates have a band of delicate ridges around their outer 

 margins, and numerous ridges which diverge from the middle of 

 the scale to the band. These ridges are undulate. Posterior to 

 the plates on each side is a long incurved bone, perhaps the man- 

 dibular angle. The pectoral fin contains about thirteen radii.

CONCHIOPSIS EXANTHEMATICUS, Cope. 



Established on a cranium entirely preserved as to its outline, 

 with adjacent portion of space for chorda dorsalis and osseous

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW MARINE SHELLS FROM THE WEST COAST OF 



FLORIDA. 



BY ROBERT E. C. STEARNS. 



Anachis semiplicata, Steams. 



Shell small, solid, elongated-ovate ; spire elevated, pointed ; 

 whorls 7-8; slightly convex, with iucouspicuons revolving grooves, 

 which latter become prominent on the lower portion 

 ^ig- 1- of the bod^^-whorl; upper portion of the basal, and a 

 portion of the contiguous volution marked by 9-12 

 modei^tely sharp longitudinal ribs, which become 

 obsolete on the lower part of the basal whorl, and 

 inconspicuous or extinct on the upper whorls, vary- 

 ing in prominence in different specimens ; suture dis- 

 tinct; aperture about half the length of the shell, 

 white, narrow, widest and angulated -above ; outer lip 

 simple, thickened near the middle, somewhat thickened, shoul- 

 dered, and curved at its junction with the body-whorl, and uo- 

 dosely ribbed within ; inner lip calloused, callous thin, elevated, 

 and finely tuberculated on its inner edge ; canal short, moderately 

 recurved. Number of specimens examined fifteen, of which the 

 largest and smallest measure as follows : — 



Most of the specimens were so coated as not to show the color ; 

 when cleansed the surface is of a light sienna-yellow, closely 

 covered with white rounded spots, which frequently coalesce ; apex 

 generally eroded. 



Habitat. — West Coast of Florida; most abundant at Charlotte 

 Harbor, where Col. E. Jewett collected many specimens, also 

 collected by myself at various points on the shores of Tampa 

 Bay. 



The species described herein belongs to a group of Anachids of 

 the same general aspect, of which A. {Columbella) avara, Say, is 

 an illustration. A. semi2:)licata differs from Mr. Saj-'s shell in 

 having a greater number of whorls, fewer longitudinal ribs, as 

 well as iu color markings, and other minor differences. Through 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 345 



an insufficient comparative examination, specimens have been dis- 

 tributed with Mr, Sa3''s name attached. 



Anachis ACUTA, Stearns. 



Shell small, slender, acutely fusiform; spire elevated, pointed, 

 nucleus rounded, number of whorls eight; in some specimens 

 slighly convex and traversed longitudinall}^ by about 

 fifteen nearly equidistant prominent rounded ribs, which Fig. 3. 

 are absent on the apex and adjoining whorl, and become 

 obsolete just below the peripher}' of the basal volution, 

 which is somewhat angulated below and at its anterior 

 portion marked distinctly with transverse costae ; in some ./ 



specimens the longitudinal ribs show a tendenc}' to nn- ;'. 



dulation, and terminate rather abruptly upon the peri- ^^ 

 pherj' of the body-whorl; suture profound, cutting the 

 ribs abruptl}' ; aperture one-third of the length of the shell, 

 whitish, narrowly ovate, augulate above ; outer lip simple, mode- 

 ratel}^ thickened ; slightly shouldered and curved above, with 5-7 

 denticles within, which regularly decrease in size anteriorly ; inner 

 lip showing a thin polished callus, ,with, in some specimens, a 

 slightly produced edge ; anterior canal short, moderately curved. 

 The shells of this species are quite variable in color, some indi- 

 viduals being of a porcellanous white, with transverse sienna lines 

 and lighter or darker blotches of the same color; others are of a 

 light sienna-yellow, with whitish blotches and brown linear mark- 

 ings. The following are the dimensions of the largest and smallest 

 specimens : — 



Length .26. Length of aperture .09. Breadth .08. 



" .23. " " .08. " .09. 



Habitat — West Coast of Florida, at Egmont Key, where several 

 specimens were collected by my friend E. Jewett, Esq. It seems 

 to be rather restricted in its distribution, and much less numerous 

 than A. avara or A. simplicata ; while the number of ribs is the 

 same as in A. avara, the shell being much slenderer, these ribs are 

 much nearer to each other, and the surface is destitute of the re- 

 volving grooves which characterize that species. 



NiTiDELLA FiLOSA, Steams. 



Shell small, acutelj' conic, spire elevated, apex rounded ; whorls 

 five, convex ; suture distinct ; surface white, traversed by nume- 

 rous equidistant fine revolving grooves ; body-whorl one-half to

 shell ; mouth ovate, outer lip simple, internally ribbed, thickened 

 at its upper part, turned and reflected upon the body-whorl, 



forming a callus on the upper portion of the columella, 

 Fig. 3. which latter is rather abruptly shortened and slightlj'' 



twisted anteriorly. 



Length .16. Length of aperture .06. Breadth .06. 



Habitat. — West Coast of Florida, on the shores of 

 Tampa Bay, collected by Col. E. Jewett. Only a few 

 specimens were obtained, of which three are in my 

 cabinet. All the specimens examined by me were beach shells, 

 without opercula, consequently the generic position is somewhat 

 doubtful. This species has apparently i-elations with NitideUa 

 (N. cribraria or N. guttata), also with Truncayia (T.eiwytoides)^ 

 but as these genera at present include many incongruous species, 

 a revision is necessary before this and similar forms can be satis- 

 factorily placed. The genus NitideUa was made by Swainson 

 {vide "Treatise on Malacology," pp. 15I-L53-313) on the Colum- 

 hella nitida, a West Indian shell, with a short spire, long bodj'- 

 whorl, and a plait on the columella, a markedly diflerent form from 

 N. guttata or N. cribraria, which are generall}^ included with it. 

 There are numerous allied forms in this connection, which approx- 

 imate so close!}' that an examination of tlie opercula is indispen- 

 sable to generic determination. ( Vide remarks of Mr. Dall in 

 Am. Journ. Conch., vol. vii. p. 115.) 



Clathurella Jewetti, Stearns. 



Sliell small, abbreviated fusiform, turreted, of a dull ashen-red- 

 dish color when dry, dark-reddish to purplish when wet; number 

 of whorls six or seven, convex and somewhat flattened 

 Fig. 4. above, sculptured with eleven or twelve prominent lon- 

 gitudinal ribs, which extend nearly or quite to the base of 

 the body-whorl ; longitudinal ribs crossed b}' ten to twelve 

 strong thread-like lateral costae, which at the points of 

 crossing are in some specimens produced into rounded 

 nodules ; the upper whorls show three to four of the 

 lateral costae, generally three ; aperture narrow, about 

 half the length of the shell, of a purplish-black or dark-chocolate 

 color; outer lip thickened and deeply notched above ; columella 

 nearly straight, calloused ; terminal canal short. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 347 



Measurements of four specimens as follows : — 



Habitat. — Rock\' Point, Tampa Ba}', West Coast of Florida, 

 where I collected four living specimens from oflf the underside of 

 clumps of oysters ; also at other points along the shores of said 

 bay and the adjacent keys, by Col. E. Jewett, who obtained many 

 specimens. It is perhaps the most common of the pleurotomoid 

 forms of the above region.

The Composition of Trautioinite. ^y E. Goldsmith. — The 

 very small quantity of the substance I had for the first examina- 

 tion of the above-named mineral (see Proceedings of the Academy, 

 Jan. 1, 1873) caused me to overlook a few important elements, 

 namely, silica and lime. 



John C. Trautwine, to whom my thanks are due for procuring 

 more of the substance, has ascertained that the locality of it is 

 Monterey Countj-, California. The mechanical separation of the 

 Trautwinite from the chromite is a difficult and tedious ope- 

 ration ; however, I succeeded so far, that with the lens no black 

 particles of chromite could be discerned. 



As the substance is insoluble in acids, I brought it into the 

 soluble condition by fusing it in a mixture of carbonate of soda 

 and saltpetre, treating the fused mass with water until all the 

 soluble parts were exhausted, and tlie insoluble part with hj'dro- 

 chloric acid. What the acid had not dissolved was again fused 

 with soda and saltpetre, and the obtained mass treated the same 

 as before. From the alkaline solution, after acidulation and re- 

 ducing the chromic acid to sesquichloride of chromium by hydro- 

 chloric acid and alcohol, I separated first silica, then the ses(iui- 

 oxide of chromium. 



The other solution, containing the bases as chlorides, was 

 evaporated to dryness, moistened with hj'drochloric acid, water 

 added, and thus I found another small quantity of silica. The 

 alumina and iron were then separated from the lime and magnesia 

 by ammonia; but the iron and alumina were again dissolved and 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



U9 



precipitated as before to insure a perfect separation from the lime 

 anil magnesia. From tlie mixed liquor containing the alkaline 

 earths tlie lime "was removed as oxalate; the magnesia fin all}' — 

 after expelling the ammoniacal salts — as ammonio-magnesia phos- 

 phate. The iron and alumina were separated by caustic potassa. 

 The iron also in this case was redissolved, and again thrown 

 down with an excess of caustic potassa to render the separation 

 of the alumina as complete as possible. After carefully washing 

 the iron, etc., the alumina was separated from the alkali in the 

 usual way. 



The result of the analysis is as follows : — 



Silica .... 



Sesquioxide of chromium 

 " iron 



" aluminum 



Lime .... 



Magnesia 



Loss on ignition 



(Si) =21.78f^. 

 (<rT) =38.39 " 

 (¥e) =13.29 " 

 (Al) = .81 " 

 (Cat = 18.58 " 

 (ilir) = 7.88 " 

 = .11 " 



100.84 



By comparison between the silica and the other oxides, I found 

 the ratio to be as 1 : 2.4 nearly' ; that is, when the sesquioxides and 

 the monoxides are added together in their respective equivalent 

 quotients. But if the quotients of the added sesquioxides and 

 the quotients of the added monoxides are compared with the 

 equivalent quotient of the silica, then the ratio of the silica to 

 the sesquioxides and to the monoxides is as 1 : .9 : 1.4. 



These figures could be used for a complicated formula, which, 

 however, I omit, because it would not give any more correct idea 

 of the combination. 



Finally, I am aware that this mineral has been erroneously 

 called ouvarovite. which, as is well known, is a variety of garnet. 



To show the diflerence in the composition of the two minerals 

 I give the results of O. L. Erdraan's analysis of ouvarovite and 

 the composition of the new species Trautwinite : — 



That these minerals are widely different from each other is 

 readil}' seen in the two lines of figures ; besides this we have also 

 the difference of form, garnet being isometric and Trautwinite 

 hexagonal. I endeavored repeatedly to project upon paper, 

 through the camera lucida, points for measuring angles of the 

 new mineral, but the results varied so much among themselves 

 that the}'^ were not fit for publication.

Exceptional Conditions in the Vegetation of Forest Seed. — Mr. 

 Thomas Meehan, in reference to the distribution of the Coniferoe 

 of the Rocky Mountains, said, that in an}- forest it must have 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 351 



struck observers that the trees were all pretty much of one age. 

 Here we see a piece of forest in which the trees might be one hun- 

 dred years old ; there another perhaps fifty ; and again young 

 ones of from ten, tn-enty, and so on. They are. however, generally 

 of one age, and though there are some A'ounger trees of various 

 ages scattered through, the great bulk of each forest started from 

 the seed in the same season together. It was remarkable that of 

 the immense amount of seeds annually produced by forest trees, 

 how few of them grew. In the forests we found, as a rule, few 

 seedlings, and though the boundaries of a piece of woodland might 

 not be under cultivation, so as to destro^y any vegetating seeds, 

 the forest boundaries were seldom enlarged in any gradual way. 

 In the woods about Philadelphia, the American white oak was not 

 particularly abundant. Here and there were a few trees in almost 

 every piece of wood ; and though the trees bore acorns only evers' 

 other year as a rule, yet in the bearing season the\' were more 

 abundant than in most other species ; yet young ones were so 

 scarce that if the forests were cut away three years ago, the suc- 

 cession would not be remarkable for Que7-cus alba. But in 1872 — 

 the productive year for the acorns — there was something so favor- 

 able to their vegetation that seedlings now abound in these woods, 

 and if the growing timber were now cut away, so as to give these 

 seedlings a fair chance for life, the future forests of this part of 

 Pennsylvania would be especiallj- of white oak — as distinctly a 

 white oak region as some parts of our country are famous for their 

 pines. "We see, however, from this that it is only at special times 

 and under special circumstances, that seeds grow to an}' great ex- 

 tent in our comparatively favored forest region, and we can un- 

 derstand better the fact referred to, of forests generally having the 

 mass of their timber trees about of one age. 



Carr3'ing these facts with us. we ma}' understand some of the 

 phenomena accompanying tiie forest distribution in the far west. 

 Along the Rock}" Mountain range, as well as in the Wahsatch and 

 Uintas, the prevailing deciduous tree, or rather shrub (for it is 

 scarcely a tree), is what has been supposed to be a variety of Quer- 

 cus alba (var. Gannisonii) by some, and l)y others a variet_y of Q. 

 Douglassii (var. neo-Me.ricaua)^ but which I believe Mr. Watson 

 has recently made a distinct species under the name of Q.polymor- 

 pha, an excellent name when the many varied forms are consid- 

 ered. It is unusual to find it growing in dense thickets. Gene- 

 rally it is in clumps of from five to twenty-five or more feet in dia- 

 meter. Each clump has evidently started from one seed at some 

 one time; and from one stem, underground suckers proceeding a 

 few inches each season, have made the mass of stems as we see 

 tliem. One could almost tell the age of the clump by the graded 

 heights of the mass, the tallest of course being in the middle, and 

 the outside often but a few inches, being the most recent growth. 

 In this wa}- the mass of varied characters becomes very striking.

If the parent plant be cut leaved, of course the whole is a cut- 

 leaved clump. If entire leaved, we have an entire-leaved clump. 

 If not of very vigorous growth, we have a clump of vegetation not 

 more than two or three feet high ; and then we have a mass of 

 vigorous growers ; one of the latter in Chejenne Caiion, south of 

 Pike's Peak, he saw with numerous little trees, perhaps thirt}- feet 

 high, and stems two feet in circumference. There appeared no- 

 where, in his man}- hundred miles of travel, an}- 5'oung seedlings ; 

 indeed no plants anywhere that were probably less than twent}'- 

 five years old ; and 3'et, in both of his visits to tliese regions, the 

 plants were bearing acorns in the greatest abundance, and evi- 

 denth" bore in this way cA-ery year. 



The coniferous trees of this region jDresent the same appearances. 

 Of some species j-ouug ones are rarel}- seen. This is especially 

 true of Pinus ponderosa, which is perhaps more widelj- distributed 

 through the Rocky Mountains than any other. The greater num- 

 ber of these trees are between one and two hundred 3-ears old. A 

 stump of one of the largest cut down in "Williams' Canon, near 

 Colorado Springs, had 216 concentric rings. Young broods of 

 perhaps ten or twenty j'ears old are occasionally seen, but not 

 often. The .young broods throughout the region between Gray's 

 Peak and Pike's Peak are chiefly of Pinus contorta, or, as it ouglit 

 perhaps to be more properh' called, Pinus Balfouriana. Sometimes 

 hundreds of acres of perhaps ten, twent}', or thirty j-ears would be 

 met with, but always of the same age in one district. Of course, 

 where this species follows Populus tremuloides, as it often does 

 when the poplar has been burned off, it is eas}" to understand how 

 the pines raa^' be all of one age ; but the uniformity is the same 

 whether the pines follow a burned district or not. Abies grandis 

 affords the greatest irregularity in ages; but this, so far as his 

 observations went, made no separate forests, but were mostly 

 mixed with other species, chiefly with Abies Douglassii, Abies 

 Mensiesii. or Abies Engelmannii. The general rule was evident 

 everywhere, that only on special occasions, and these apparently 

 often at long intervals, did a crop of young coniferous trees appear. 



These facts being gained, we can understand at least some of the 

 influences at work to prevent the spread of timber on the prairies 

 from the trees growing along the river banks, or on to the low 

 lands from tlie timljcred regions on the heights. If iinder the most 

 favorable conditions in the East, and on the cool slopes of moun- 

 tains, it is but occasionally that the seeds find a conjunction of 

 elements favorable to successful growth, how much more rare must 

 these circumstances be on a dry, hot prairie ? Seeds ma}' fall for 

 ages along the line of a river, and yet not a tree be found a hun- 

 dred yards from the river line. 



He thought, also, the facts would account for what is known as 

 the timber line in the Rocky ^lountains. This was not an arbi- 

 trary division, decided by mere altitude, as was populary supposed ; 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 853 



but depended on the fa Adorable or unfavorable circumstances under 

 which seeds in certain seasons found themselves. The ascent of 

 Gray's Peak by the "waj' of the Clear Creek Canon afforded an 

 illustration. At the base of the mountain, we find Pinus contorta, 

 P. ponderosa, Abies Engelmannii, and a few Abies grandis. As we 

 advance all disappear except Abies Engelmannii, but Pinus aris- 

 tata takes the place of the departed ones. Advancing higher, P. 

 aristata disappears, and only A. Engelmannii is left for the last 

 half mile before reaching the "timber line." The last series of 

 trees appear about fifty yeai-s old, even to the boundary line, and 

 then comes perhaps a half mile of Juniperus alpina, Salix arctica, 

 and other small growing things. But on examining this mass of 

 scrubb}' growth, a large quantity of Abies Engelmannii, not more 

 than a couple of feet high, about twentj' years of age, and seemingly 

 never to be anything more than scrubs, is found growing with it. 

 An examination of the forests at lower altitudes, however, shows 

 that Abies Engelmannii, even at a thousand feet below, made its 

 first twenty or thirty years in a similar scrubbj' condition. It was 

 no uncommon thing to find specimens of this tree perhaps sixty 

 feet or more in height, when clothed with branches to the ground, 

 to have the early branches at the ground still remaining, and in 

 just the same condition as those above the " timber line." The 

 same thing occui's in American nurseries with some firs. Picea 

 pectinata generally remains in this semi-stunted condition for ten 

 or twent}^ 3'ears, losing its leader annuall}^, spreading its side 

 branches, but increasing its trunk at the ground, and its tap-root 

 in length. After that it ascends rapidly, its leading shoot seldom 

 being destroyed afterwards. lie saw no reason, as Grab's Peak 

 was not one of perpetual snow, except perhaps in some of the 

 deepest ravines, wh}' under favorable seasons for germination, 

 Abies Engelmannii might not in time advance towards the top, 

 without regard to any arbitrary "■ timber line." 



The facts he offered were he thought worthy of attention by 

 those interested in the geographical distribution of plants. Most 

 forest trees seeded abundantly' every 3'ear, and 3'et nature seemed to 

 have placed some check on the ultimate perfection of her own great 

 work. And indeed we could see the wisdom of this check ; for if 

 the seeds of these strong forest trees were to grow as readil}^ as 

 the seeds of the smaller annuals, the world, in the absence of man 

 to cultivate, would have its smaller vegetation crowded out, and 

 it would be one vast forest ; and j-et it seemed an enigma that na- 

 ture should produce such an immense amount of seed with one 

 hand, only to be destroj^ed by the other, unless we accept this 

 principle, that seed growth is only occasional and exceptional to 

 any great extent, and then we see how essential it is always to 

 have a large and fresh stock constantly on hand, as a seedsman 

 would sa}", so that advantage could be taken of the exceptional 

 conditions when they occurred.

MaJfoi'med Red Clover. — Mr. Thomas Meehan also presented 

 some specimens of a malformed clover, Trifolium pratense^ handed 

 to him by a fellow member, Mr. Isaac Burk, Avith the request to 

 bring it to the notice of the Academy if of interest. 



The flowers, usually sessile, were in this case elevated on pedi- 

 cels about an inch long, and from these, what should normally be 

 the gj'noecium, was again deA'eloped into a short pedicel bearing a 

 calyx, one of the segments of which, usually little more than a 

 mere cilia, was developed into a complete leaflet. The case af- 

 forded no light on morphological law bej'ond what was already 

 known ; but the fact that the Red Clover grew in this way, had 

 not, he believed, been recorded. 



Mr. Gentry made the following remarks regarding the nest of 

 Yireo solitarius, Yieil. 



Audubon, in describing the nest of Yireo solitarius, Yieil., affirms 

 it " is prettily constructed and fixed in a partially pensile manner 

 between two twigs of a low bush, on a branch running horizon- 

 tall}' from the main stem, and formed externally of gray lichens, 

 slightlj' put together, and lined with hair chiefly from the deer 

 and raccoon." My experience has been quite difterent. Out of 

 the man}' nests which I have seen and examined, I cannot recall 

 a single specimen that will answer to the above description. I 

 have five nests of this species, four of which are perfectly similar 

 in structure; the remaining one formed of the culms of a species 

 of Aira^ constituting an exceptional case, and the onl}- one that 

 has ever fallen under my notice. They are all shallow, loose in 

 texture, scarcely surviving the season for which they were de- 

 signed, and placed between two twigs of a cedar or a maple tree 

 at a considerable elevation from the ground, on a branch nearly 

 horizontal to the main axis. They are built entirely of clusters 

 of male flowers of Quercua palustris, wliich, having performed 

 their allotted function, don their brownish hue at the very period 

 when the}' can be utilized. 



Here is evidently a change within a moderately short period, 

 rendered necessary by external causes. This necessity may have 

 grown out of inability to procure the favorite materials, or a desire 

 for self-preservation. In the case of tlie species under conside- 

 ration, it cannot be denied that the utter inabilit}', without unne- 

 cessary physical effort, to procure the hair of the afore-mentioned 

 animals, particularly in sections where they have been compelled 

 to retreat before the advance of man, may have been one of the 

 causes which have induced the change. 1 am satisfied, however, 

 that it has not been the leading one, but that self-preservation 

 has ojjerated in this case for individual and family good. The 

 adaptation of the colors of the female bird to the tints of sur- 

 rounding objects, during the trying period of incubation, nnd the 

 estal)lishment of certain resemblances to familiar external objects 

 are two of the ways in which it manifests itself.

OBITUARY NOTICE OF ELIAS DURAND. 



In an institution like ours, devoted wholly to the stud}' of the 

 natural sciences, it is meet, when a distinguished member passes 

 away, that we pause to ask ourselves what science has gained by 

 his illustrious career ; and, by reviewing the details of his useful 

 life, dei'ive new encouragement to press onwards in our studies. 

 Thus shall the good which a man doeth live after him ; for surely 

 of all men the scientist liveth not in vain. 



We are proud that in the history of science so many members 

 of our body hold a distinguished place. Among these great 

 names, that of our late associate, Elias Durand, will always be 

 gratefull}- remembered. He was elected a resident member of 

 tlie Academy in 1852, and his whole life has been one of con- 

 tinuous devotion to science. 



Elias Durand (Elie Magloire Durand) was born in Mayenne, 

 France, on the 25th of January, 1794, where his father, Andre 

 Durand, was recorder of deeds, and in which Elias, the youngest 

 of fourteen children, received his education. In 1808, he com- 

 menced a four years' study under M. Chevalier, eminent as a 

 pharmacien and scientist, and to wliose kindl}' interest in his 

 success, Mr. Durand was fond of attributing his successful course 

 in life. In the fall of 1812, he arrived in Paris and attended the 

 scientific lectures of Thinard, Gay-Lussac, Lefevre, and Ginault, 

 and a course on general literature by Andrieux. He received a 

 commission as assistant pharmacien, and after examination, was 

 complimented by M. Parmentier, Inspector-General of the Phar- 

 maceutical Department of the Army, by being placed on the head 

 of the list of applicants, and soon was ordered to join the 5th 

 corps of observation on the Elbe. He presented his commission 




356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



to Field-Marshal Kellerman, and joined the armj' immediately at 

 Magdeburg. He participated in most of the battles -wliicli followed, 

 taking part especially in the bloody one at Leipsic. At the 

 battle of Hanau, he was one of about a dozen who succeeded in 

 crossing a stream, out of some hundreds who were killed or 

 wounded in the attempt, and was cai)turcd by the enenn- ; but 

 the oflScer in charge, in pit}- at the awful dcstructic>n which had 

 left so few, suffered tliem to go free after a short detention. On 

 the downfall of Xapoleon, he resigned his commission, notwith- 

 standing the opposition of his Chief, ^I. Lodibert. Years after- 

 wards, when this distinguished gentleman was President of the 

 Pharmaceutical Societj' of Paris, he remembered the former j-oung 

 man of twenty, but now in the United States, and projiosed his 

 name in a highly complimentar}^ manner for membership in that 

 institution. Leaving the army, he entered the drug store of M. 

 Fretand, at Nantes, directed the chemical manipulations in the 

 apothecaries' garden, and lectured to the students on medical 

 botau}'. On the return of Napoleon he at once rejoined the 

 army, and served during the celebrated one hundred days, as one 

 of the National Guards. On the 15th of June, came Waterloo, 

 and on the 26th, the allies entered Paris. Durand, with his 

 strong Napoleonic tendenc}', was continually under surveillance, 

 to escape which he sailed for the United States, arriving at New 

 York on the 1st of Jul}'^, 1816. Proceeding to Boston, Bishop 

 Chevrus, a distant relative, introduced him to the leading scientists 

 of that city, and he became superintendent of the chemical 

 laboratory of a Mr. Perkins. After a few months, considerations 

 of health led him into a similar position with a Mr. Wesner, at 

 Broad and Race, in Philadelphia, but he found it necessary soon 

 after to abandon this pursuit, and devote himself to pharmacy 

 exclusively. 



After a short residence near Baltimore, he obtained a letter 

 of introduction to Dr. Troost, who at that time was engaged in 

 the manufacture of alum and sulphate of iron, but who lived at 

 Cape Sable, twent\' miles awa}'. Mr. Durand's diary gives a 

 graphic account of this journe}', made on foot, in deep snow, through 

 a dense pine forest, in the depth of winter, and with but two 

 houses on the whole track, one of these a country inn filled with 

 pictures of murders of whites b}' red-skins, and other phases of 

 Indian life. He tells of his subsequent meeting with Indians : his 

 fear of his life, but found kind treatment from them ; his taking 

 the wrong trail in the dark, and finding and stopping over night 

 at a farm-honse, and of the kind treatment he received there, 

 ending in his being sent under care of a slave to Dr. Troost's the 

 next da}-. Notwithstanding what he had formerly been through, 

 this little circumstance seems among the most impressing events 

 of his life. He describes Dr. Troost as a gentleman of very primi- 

 tive appearance, leading a sort of backwoodsman's life, but ex- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 357 



hibiting the most unbounded generosity and kindly feeling. He 

 could not assist him in getting employment, but lie urged him to 

 make his home with him for a'while, as " he Avas much in need of 

 some educated person to talk with." He spent two months with 

 Dr. Troost, and there is little doubt but that this incident tended 

 to confirm his already decided taste for natural history. By the 

 influence of Dr. Troost, he became chief clerk in the establishment 

 of Mr. Ducatel of Baltimore, whose daughter he ultimately married. 

 Mrs. Durand died in 1822; and his daughter, the only child by this 

 marriage, in 1836. 



In 1823 Mr. Ducatel retired from business, leaving it to his son 

 Jules, afterwards professor of chemistry in the Baltimore ^Medical 

 School, and State Geologist of Maryland, and he took Mr. Durand 

 into partnership with him. At the end of the 3'ear he withdrew 

 from the partnership with the view of opening a store in Piiiladel- 

 phia. He went to France, returned to New York in April, 1825, 

 and immediately after opened his store on the southwest corner of 

 Sixth and Che^stnut, in Philadelphia, which ultimately became 

 one of the most distinguished pharmaceutical establishments in 

 this country-. His interest in his business was not merely that 

 of a trader; he carried into it the same love of science which 

 endears his memory to us to-day. The first contribution to the 

 Journal of Pharmacy was from his pen; and the catalogue of the 

 Royal Society of London gives a long list of valuable papers con- 

 tributed b}- him to various magazines and institutions, on matters 

 connected with this branch of science. 



To us he will ever be remembered as a botanist. During all 

 the long 3'ears referred to, his devotion to this department of 

 natural histor}^ never flagged. His store was the resort of the 

 most intelligent ; and botanists sat at his right hand. His purse 

 assisted many a botanical traveller; and thus it was that the collec- 

 tions of Nuttall, and man}' other valuable herbariums fell into his 

 hands. Thej'did not however always come to him in this directway. 

 He loved to tell of his being told of a lot of plants which had been 

 stowed away in a loft for many years, and which he could buy 

 cheap ; and after paying little more than the price of waste paper, 

 he found to his surprise that it was the herbarium of Rafine.sque, 

 which for so long a time had been the home of innumerable rats. 

 His pains-taking accuracy and industr}' had eai'ly gained him a re- 

 putation; and a wealth}^ young gentleman of Ohio, determining to 

 stud}' botan}', and anxious to purchase a herbarium to begin with, 

 was referred to Mr. Durand, who sold his to him at ten cents a 

 species, amounting to about §1000, which will give some idea of 

 the extent of his labors at that time. His own distant collections 

 were not numerous, but in 1837 he made an extended exploration 

 of the Dismal Swamp in Virginia, and in 1862 another through 

 the mountains of Pennsylvania. Shorter excursions with Count 

 Survilliers, Joseph Buonaparte, and other eminent scientific men 

 were numerous. 




358 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



In 18f)2 lie retired from business in order to devote the remain- 

 der of his life to botanical science. His first great work was to 

 add to the berbarium of our Academ}-^ desiderata which his own 

 could supply. In this war we came into possession of a large 

 number of Nuttall's plants, besides numerous others. Indeed, the 

 Nortli American Herbarium of the Academy, as it now stands, is 

 mainly' the work of Mr. Durand. While in Europe in 180)0 he found 

 the herbarium of the Garden of Plants at Paris deficient in Xorth 

 American species, and on his return devoted much of his time to 

 preparing his collection for that institution. He took the major 

 part there in 1868, and left by his will the balance to it, making 

 in all about 15,000 species, in which institution thej' will be pre- 

 served separately as the Herbier Durand. He presented his bo- 

 tanical library to the Acadeni}' of Natural Sciences, and his library 

 of chemical and pharmaceutical works, together with a herbarium 

 of medical plants, to the College of Pharmacy. 



The first great contribution to botanical literature after his re- 

 tirement from business in 1852 was the " Plantse Prattenianse Cali- 

 fornicse,''^ published in the Journal of the Academy- in 1855-58, 

 and about the same time in the same volume " Plantse Knneanas 

 Gi'cenlandicse,^' being the plants of Kane's twovo3'ages to the arctic 

 regions; and also during the same period, in connection with Dr. 

 Hilgard.in the same journal, the " Plantse Heermannianse^^^ being 

 the collections of Dr. Heermann, the naturalist attached to Lieut. 

 "Williamson's surve3- of the Pacific Railroad. In 1860 the botany 

 of the Salt Lake of Utah, in Am. Philos. Transactions. In 1861 

 he gave in the Proceedings of the Acadenn' an account of the Arctic 

 plants of Hayes's expedition; and in 1862 an article in the Bulletin 

 of the Paris Acclimatization Society on the vines and wines of the 

 L'nited States, which attracted much attention in Europe. He is 

 also the author of a memoir of Andre Michaux, and also of his 

 friend Xuttall. which, from his intimacy with this great botanist, 

 he was enabled to make the best one written. 



For two years past age seemed to tell on him rapidly, and his 

 regular attendance on his appointed and much loved duties in the 

 Academy was broken up. During the past year his brain gradually 

 softened, until, on the 14th of August, 1873, he peacefully passed 

 away, in the 79th year of his age, leaving an only son by a second 

 marriage, who has already distinguished himself in one branch of 

 his father's favorite studies; and a memory which we, his asso- 

 ciates in this Academy, will long, gratefull}', and fondly cherish. 



From such a life how much the world maj- learn I Here is a 

 young man surrounded by ditficulties, but who was never appalled 

 or turned aside from the zealous pursuit of knowledge. It did 

 not interfere with his business success, as it is a popular fallacy 

 such studies tend to do, but it aided him to the highest eminence 

 in his profession. It brought him into contact with many kindred 

 spirits in this and similar institutions, which in turu fanned his 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 359 



enthusiasm, and added to the great pleasure he took in life. His 

 benevolent spirit overflowed wberever the wants of man were to 

 be relieved; and in the added facts to science, he knew, as we all 

 know, that he was bequeatliing a legacy to posterit}' which wonld 

 benefit it for all time to come. 



On report of the committee the following paper was ordered 

 to be published : —

ON A NEW AMERICAN SPECIES OF PLEURONECTOID (GLYPTOCEPHALUS 



ACADIANUS). 



BY THEODORE GILL, M.D. 



In the " Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 

 PhiLadelphia" for 1864 (pp. 214-224), was published a "Synopsis 

 of the Pleuronectoids of the eastern coast of Xorth America," in 

 which two generic t3'pes, either entirely new (Euchalarodus) or 

 new to the coast ( Githarichthys)^ were made known. The present 

 article may be regarded as supplementary' to that. 



The onl}'^ known specimen of the new type was obtained from 

 a pond at Eastport, Maine, during the month of August, by an 

 attache (Dr. Edward Palmer) of the Commissioner of Fisheries 

 (Prof. Baird), and, notwithstanding the assiduous attentions of 

 the commissioner and his staff, no other specimens were found; it 

 must, therefore, be actually a very rare fish, or (what is more 

 probable in such cases) peculiar in its habitat, and rarely coming 

 within the range of operations of the fisherman. 



An attentive examination and comparison of this species with 

 the Glyptocephalus cynodlossus, of Europe, indicate that it is 

 congeneric with that species and with the Plafessa elongafa of 

 Yarrell, but more nearly allied to the latter. As the genus is now 

 for the first time introduced into our fauna, a description of the 

 characters common to all the species (generic), as well as distinc- 

 tive of the new form (specific), is given.

Body oblong fusiform, with the caudal peduncle abbreviated. 

 Scales minute, oval, cycloid on the eyed as well as blind side, 

 and regularly imbricated. 



Lateral line straight, with its scales covered on both sides by 

 the adjoining ones. 



Head small, ovate, the profile being slightly decurved, and with 

 the rostral area rhomboid ; covered with minute imbricated scales 

 on the cheeks and opercular bones ; on the blind side exhibiting 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 361 



foveae or pits in the cranium and preoperculum ; orbital ridge 

 prominent, narrow, and curved upwards towards the lateral line 

 (with no bonj' tubercles). 



Eyes moderate, approximated, the upper (in tj-pical species) 

 somewhat further back than the lower, mostly in the anterior third 

 of head. 



Nostrih of the eyed side parallel with the axis of the bod}^ ; 

 the posterior patulous, and above the supraorbital crest ; the an- 

 terior tubular, and near the border of the snout; those of the 

 blind side in an oblique row ; the posterior patulous ; the " ante- 

 rior" tubular. 



3Iouth very small, with the cleft very oblique, deeper and less 

 oblique (the supramaxillary being longer) on the blind side. 

 Lower jaw scarcely prominent, with a declining obtusely- angular 

 (not tuberculated) chin. 



Lips moderate and simple, free all around. 



Tongue small and scarcely free. 



Teeth fixed, uniserial, on the blind side approximated and with 

 compressed squarish crowns; on the ej'ed side (1) similar or (2) 

 more distant and obtusely conic. (Palate unarmed.) 



Branchial apertures closed above the opercula, with the mem- 

 brane free below. 



Branchiostegal rays seven. 



Dorsal fin with its raj's simple, in large number (100-120); with 

 its origin above the middle of the upper orbit, with the foremost 

 and hindmost rays (when at rest) converging, and the rest erect. 



Anal fin with its rays simple, in large number (90-105), with 

 its foremost and hindmost Ya.ys couvei'ging, but the rest erect;, 

 preceded in front by a well-defined spur-like spine curved for- 

 wards. 



Caudal fin convex or angulated behind. 



Pectoral fins small, obliquely rounded behind, and with branched 

 rays. 



Ventral fin subbrachial, normall}^ developed. 



!r?/pe, Pleuronectes cynoglossus, Linn. 



This genus is well distinguished by the elongated and com- 

 pressed body covered by cycloid scales, the straight lateral line, 

 the small head with its well-defined foveae (showing through the 

 seal}' skin) of the cranial and preopereular regions, the numerous 

 dorsal and anal rays, and the preanal sijur-like spine. Three

362 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



species seem now to be referable to the genus: (1) the typical 

 species {G. cynoglossus = Pleuronectes cynoglossus^ Linn); (2) a 

 rare British form (G. elongatiis = Platessa elongata, Yarrell), and 

 (3) an nndescribed species peculiar to the Acodian province of 

 naturalists {G. acadianus. Gill). These appear to represent two 

 sections of the genus; the first species one, and the second and 

 third another. 



GLYPTOCEPHALUS ACADIANUS, Gill. 



The height of the bod}' enters about 2i times in the length, ex- 

 clusive of the caudal (3;^ in the extreme length) ; the height of 

 the caudal peduncle is little more than 1^ of its length. The 

 head enters 5^ times in the length. 



The teeth are decidedl}^ unlike on the respective sides, those of 

 the blind side being close set, with incisorial edges, about 17 in 

 the upper jaw, and 20 in the lower ; those of the eye side distant, 

 obtusely conic, 6 in the upper and Y in the lower jaw. The greatest 

 height of the dorsal equals about half the length of the head, as 

 does also that of the anal. The caudal fin enters about 5^ times 

 in the extreme length. The pectoral fin (of the dark side) is con- 

 siderably more than half tlie head's length, and the ventral con- 

 siderablj- less than half; the base of the ventral is under that of 

 the pectoral (but a little further advanced). 



D. 110, A. 100. 



The color is rufous-brown, immaculate. 



Tlie single specimen, from which the above description was 

 taken, was apparently not full grown, and, as already remarked, 

 was obtained from a net at Eastport, Maine. 



The species is evidently congeneric with, and closel}"^ related 

 to, the G. elongates (Plofessa elongata), of which an incorrect 

 figure is given in Yarrell's work, and (in some respects) a more 

 accurate one in Couch's History of British Fishes; it is, however, 

 less elonofated and the head larger.

Laio of Seed Germination in Swamp Plants Referring to a few 



brief remarks of Mr. Aubrey H. Smith, on a former occasion, in 

 regard to the naturalization of Taxodium distichuni on compara- 

 tively dr}' ground in the Northern States, Mr. Thomas Meehan 

 said that it was an error to suppose that nature placed trees in 

 places the best suited to their growth. Almost all of our swamp 

 trees grew much better when they could get into drj-er places, if 

 in ordinary good land. He referred among others to Magnolia 

 glauca, Acer rubrum. Celtis occidentalis, Ilex opaca. Cupressus 

 chamrecyparis, Cephalanthus occidentalis, Salix bab^-lonica, espe- 

 cially as, within his own repeated observations, growing better out 

 of swamps than in them. Wh}- it was that they grew in swamps 

 was no enigma to those in the habit of raising forest trees from 

 seed. It was found that seeds of these trees would only germinate 

 in damp places, and, of course, in a state of nature the tree had 

 to remain in the place where the seed germinated. 



He thought the principle taught that plants required water to 

 grow well was true only in so far as a humid condition of the soil 

 was concerned. Plants, as a general thing, though they were of the 

 class known especially- as water plants, preferred to grow out of the 

 water, except in those which grew almost entirely beneath the sur- 

 face. He had found such plants as Pol^'gonum ampliibium and 

 some of the water-loving Ranunculi, grow much more Uixuriously 

 in the terrestrial than in the aquatic state. As was well known, 

 the Taxodium distichum in the southern swamps sent up "knees" 

 from various points as the I'oots extended, often as large as old- 

 fashioned bee-hives, and several feet above the surface. He had 

 observed that not onh' were the cypress trees at least as large and 

 luxuriant when growing in good, rather dr\' ground ; but the ten- 

 denc}- to throw up these knees was in a measure lost. They were 

 generally small, but often wholl}* wanting. With the general facts 

 before us of the antipath}- of swamp plants to their watery fate, 

 he thought one might be safe in concluding that these root excres- 

 cences were the result of an effort of the plant to counteract the 

 law which, against its own desires, to speak metaphoricallv, had 

 found itself obliged b}' the necessities of its law of seed germina- 

 tion to be a denizen of a swamp. 



Mr. Aubrey H. Smith said : In connection with the observations 

 of Mr. Meehan. I think it worth recording; that a few vears a^o I 




364 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



collected some plants of Talinum terelifolium Pursh, on the ser- 

 pentine rocks of Chester County, near Westchester, and transferred 

 them to the small garden in the rear of my house in this city. 

 The place chosen for them was close to tlie hydrant, where the 

 very rich soil was constantl}' in a humid condition. The plants 

 throve greatly, producing flowers and perfect fruit in abundance, 

 and extending their tuber-like roots on all sides. In the early 

 spring, observing these roots half-exposed on the surface of the 

 ground, I pressed them down with my finger and covered them 

 with earth. The plants continued to thrive and multiply in this 

 situation for several years, forming a thick mat of considerable 

 extent, with no further care than the occasional covering of their 

 roots in the spring. Subsequently the}' were superseded by Hel- 

 onias bullata, for which their site was the best in my possession. 

 This, however, bloomed but feebly and died in the earl}' heat of 

 the next summer. 



When we consider that Talinum teretifolium grows only on 

 dry rocks and, in Penns^dvania, is confined to the ledges and fis- 

 sures of the serpentine, seeking, as it were by preference, the 

 poorest and dryest soils, it affords a striking illustration of the 

 truth of Mr. Meehau's remark that nature does not alwaj's put 

 plants in places most suitable to their growth. What condition 

 essential to the perpetuation of this plant exists in the arid ser- 

 pentine, I am not able to state. It may concern the germination 

 of its seed or the protection of its fleshy roots. It certainly' does 

 not govern its nutrition and fructification.

On Distoma hepaticum. — Prof. Leidy stated that he had received 

 a letter from Prof. Gross, inclosing one from Dr. J. G. Kerr, of 

 Canton, China, asking information in regard to a worm accompany- 

 ing the letter. Dr. Kerr observes that the worm was vomited by 

 a Chinese boy, aged fifteen years, and was brought to him an hour 

 after its expulsion, when it was still alive. It had the appearance 

 of a leech, was red in color, about an inch and a half long and 

 three-fourths of an inch where widest. Dr. Kerr also states that 

 a girl, of four j-ears, of English parents, living in Canton, passed 

 from the bowels at one time nine of these worms. With these 

 exceptions. Dr. Kerr had not met with an}' one who had ever seen 

 or heard of anything of the kind. 



Prof. Leid}' exhibited the specimen and expressed the opinion 

 that the worm was a Liver-fluke, Distoma hejjaticum, a rare para- 

 site in the human subject, though common enough in cattle, espe- 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. SGo 



cially sheep, in which it caused the disease called "rot." The 

 worm exhibits some differences from D. hepaticum as usually de- 

 scribed, but perhaps not sufficient to characterize it as a distinct 

 species. The specimen ?s preserved in strong alcohol, which no doubt 

 has much contracted and reduced it in size, but it is j'et rather 

 larger than the size assigned to D. hepaticum. It is perfectly 

 smooth throughout, and exhibits no trace of roughness to the in- 

 tegument. It is ovate-lanceolate in form, and gradually widens 

 from the anterior to the posterior rounded extremit}'. The ventral 

 acetabulum is twice the size of the mouth, and is situated about 

 its own diameter behind it. The genital orifice with the exserted 

 spiral penis is placed just in advance of the ventral acetabulum. 

 The measurements of the worm in its present condition are as 

 follows: Length 17 lines, width at the posterior third 7 lines, 

 thickness near centi'e 1 line, diameter of mouth fths of a line, 

 diameter of acetabulum |ths of a line. 



Prof. Leidy further remarked that Dr. Kej'ser, of this city, the 

 evening previously had brought to him for examination a worm, 

 which was stated to have been removed from the cavit}' of the nose 

 of a patient. He recognized the worm as a rat-tail lava, appa- 

 rently of the genus Erisfahs, and inquired of those members in- 

 terested in entomology, if they had ever known this insect to be 

 found as a parasite in the human body. Both Drs. LeConte and 

 Horn said that they had never heard of this genus being parasitic. 



Analysis of Chromite from Ilonterey County, California. By 

 E. Goldsmith. — Xo analysis of chromite from this localitj^, so far 

 as I am aware, has yet been published. Mine was undertaken 

 with the view to ascertain what particular relation it might have 

 to Trautwinite. As the last-named mineral is found on it, I pre- 

 sumed that the latter might have originated from the former. A 

 chemical analysis only could decide the question. The process 

 pursued was in all respects the same as that followed in my pre- 

 vious investigation of Trautwinite; not omitting great care in 

 the preliminary mechanical separation of the two species from 

 each other. The following table gives the result of both anal^'ses 

 and a comparison of the two minerals, together with the differ- 

 ences : — 



The formation of Trautwinite from chromite may be conceived 

 to have taken place in accordance with the neptunian hypothesis, 

 by the combination of silica and lime with the chromite, thus pro- 




366 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



ducing the new compound ; since both the oxides dissolve in water. 

 When under these circumstances none of the constituents of the 

 older mineral separates, it is self-evident tliat they will all present 

 themselves in less quantity in the newly formed combination tlian 

 in tlu\t from which it was derived. If a silicate of lime had simph' 

 been mixed with the Trautwinite, hydroeliloric acid would have 

 affected it. But the acids have no action upon it ; hence it is 

 very probable that the silica and lime combined with the chroraite 

 form the mineral which we call Trautwinite. 



The death of Theodore F. Moss was announced.

Stihiaferrile^ a nev) Mineral from Santa Clara County^ Cali- 

 fornia. By E. Goldsmith — The mineral occurs on Stibnite, and 

 enters the rock on both sides. The Stibnite between the two 

 layers of the new mineral is \^ inch thick; and this appears to 

 be the thiclvuess of tiie vein at the spot wlience the specimen was 

 taken. The layers of the Stihinferrite vary in thickness from a 

 thin coating to about a quarter of an inch. 



Tlie most of it is amorphous. On examining a number of spe- 

 cimens, I observed some small cavities containing, I believe, the 

 same substance in crystals. Tlie crystals, when observed under a 

 power of a f lens, have the habitus of ortho-rhombic prisms. 

 They are generally attached by one end, but a few extend to the 

 other side of the cavity. The termination is the basal plane ; I 

 could not find a crystal having a finite pyramid ; the infinite 

 pyramids were those of the first and second order. The measure- 

 ment of one of the crj'stals, which had a favorable position for 

 oliservation, was performed with a goniometer (Leeson's) belong- 

 ing to Mr. Clarence S. Bement. Although I made several efforts 

 to get the exact angles of the cr^'stals, j'et I wish it to be undei*- 

 stood that the values obtained are only approximate.

The fracture is uneven conchoidal. Opaque in the amorphous, 

 subtranslucent when crystallized. 



The lustre is slightly resinous. 



The color of the crystallized mineral is faint yellow. 



The amorphous is more yellow, and, on some parts, it is even 

 brownish-yellow. 



The streak is dull yellow. The powder of the mineral in a 

 thick layer on a white surface is straw-3'ellow. 



The cohesion is not strong; it yields easily to the point of the 

 knife, producing angular pieces, brittle. 



The hardness is equal to fluorite, or 4. 



Specific gi'avity = 3.598. 



The mineral has no effect on the magnetic needle. 



Pyrochemical test: In the glass tube closed on one end it affords 

 water and a white sublimate. On charcoal, metallic globules and 

 a white incrustation, which deposited far from the test, and on 

 stopping the fire, rising fumes. Borax aflbrds, in tlie oxidizing 

 and in the reducing flames, beads, which are j-ellow while hot and 

 colorless after cooling. 



In nitric acid the substance is not soluble. Hydrochloric acid 

 dissolves it, except quartz, which is an impurity. 



Caustic potassa decomposes the mineral, changing the 3'ellow 

 powder apparently into red. The liquor, however, then contained 

 antimoniate of potassa, which, when poured into a mixture of 

 iodide of potassium and hydrochloric acid, liberated iodine. The 

 red powder I ascertained to be sesquioxide of iron. 



The quantity of the water I determined by the loss on heating 

 the substance to a low red heat. 



For the quantitative determination of the antiraonic acid I 

 fused the substance with carbonate of soda and sulphur ; extracted 

 the black mass wdth water, washed, precipitated the sulphuretted 

 antimon}' with h3'drochloric acid, and, after drying and weigliing 

 tiie mixture of sulphuret of antimony and sulphur, I analyzed an 

 aliquot part of it, according to Bunsen's process. (It appears 

 that the adopted process chosen for the determination of the anti- 

 mony is one of the best known ; 3'et the loss is always greater than 

 it ouglit to be for close work. It would be a good gift if an^-bodj' 

 could present us with a process for the determination of anti- 

 monv in which the weighing of the sulphuret of antimony and 

 sulphur on a dried paper filter could be avoided.) The iron and 

 the quartz were determined in the usual wa^'. 



Tile result of the anal3'sis was — 



Sb 42.96 per cent. 



¥e 31.85 " 



H 15.26 



Quartz 8.84 •' 



Loss 1.09 "

368 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



After deducting the quartz and calculating the remainder to 

 percentage, I obtain for the pure substance : — 



Bb . . . 47.69 per cent. Oxygen . . . 11.77 

 Pe . . . 35.36 " ^" . . . 10.60 



fi: . . . 16.94 " "... 15.0.5 



The equivalent oxygen ratio of Sb : Pe : His as 1.1 : 1 : 1.4, or 

 nearly as 1 : 1 : H, for which I propose the formula 2(§b4- Pe) -{- 3fl. 



The mineral described is therefore a hydrous antimoniate of 

 iron. 



In regard to the Stibnite, from which the Stibiaferrite was pro- 

 bably derived, I have to state a few facts. I made an analysis of 

 it in order to ascertain whether it contained ^uy antimonic acid, 

 or a large amount of iron in any form, but both questions were 

 answered in the negative. The principal difference in the compo- 

 sition of the Stibnite is the large amount of silica with which it 

 is intimatel}^ mixed, besides a little arsenic and lead, probably 

 present as sulphui'ets. The quantitative determination of the 

 latter two I omitted. In all, I ascertained that the antimon}^ Avas 



h\\\j saturated with sulphur to form tlie tersulphuret of antimony.

I have also a specimen of the rock in which the vein of the 

 Stibnite occurs, and into which the Stibiaferrite ramifies. The 

 purest part is white, some is grayish and yellow, caused by the 

 Stibiaferrite. The fracture is rough, uneven, on some parts angu- 

 lar. I observed cracks in all directions, but, when closel}^ examined 

 with the lens, I noticed that they are filled with the Stibiaferrite. 



The rock is perfectl}' dull, and so is the streak. 



The hardness varies between 3 and 5. 



The sjiecific gravity I found to be = 2.7529. 



Pyrochemical test: On charcoal alone no change. With carb. 

 soda, evolution of carbonic acid gas takes place; and the sub- 

 stance dissolves in the soda, forming a dirty green glass. 



In the glass tube closed on one end it affords water and dark- 

 ness. 



Hj'drochloric acid has but little effect on it ; the acid solution 

 contained but a small amount of Sb and Fe. Hydrofluoric acid 

 dissolves it readily on warming, leaving but a little residue after 

 evaporating the liquor. Caustic potassa dissolves it nearl^^ all, 

 the residue left was very little. The qualitative analysis of a very 

 white piece of this rock furnished the result that the principal 

 substance is amorphous silica, mixed with a little of the oxides of 

 antimonj', lead, and iron. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 369 



A quantitative Bausch analysis of this rock I did not undertake, 

 because ever}' specimen has probably a ditferent composition, due 

 to the unequal distribution of the Stihiaferrite. 



As I have not seen the rock in situ, I cannot say whether there 

 occurs more antimony in the form of Stihiaferrite or as Stibnite ; 

 at any rate, it is worth while for the managers of the mine to 

 make this inquiry and let us know. 



Tlie Stibnite had on one spot a cavit}' containing about four 

 cr\'stals of very small size. Viewed under the microscope one 

 white crA'stal had the form of Yalentinite, as figure 179 in Dana's 

 Desc. Min., which crystal was attached to a crj-stal of Stibnite, 

 showing tlie gradual change of the latter into the former. Another 

 crj'stal appeared to be a perfect cul)e, which may be Senarmontite. 



I first saw the specimens in the collection of John C. Traut- 

 wine, C. E. This gentleman called ni}^ attention to the peculiar 

 yellow mineral on the Stil)nite, wiiich he presumed to be new ; the 

 presumption is correct so far as my investigation goes, and I here-

" On the Homologies and Origin of the Types of Molar Teeth 



in Mammalia Educabilia." By E. D. Cope. " Contribution to 



the Ichthyology of Alaska." By E. D. Cope. 



Prof. Cope remarked that he had observed in the Rocky Moun- 

 tain region circles of stones arranged by human hands, in countries 

 not now inhabited b}^ the Indians. One of these is in South-wes- 

 tern Wyoming near South Bitter Creek, inside the horseshoe of 

 the Mammoth Buttes. The locality is a very barren one, being a 

 sage-brush plain of alkaline del)ris from the bad lands of the 

 Bridger Formation. It is nine miles from the nearest spring, 

 which is of indifferent qualit}^ and being in a region where game 

 is very scarce, could hardlj'^ be regarded as a camping-ground. 

 The circle consists of three uninterrupted concentric rings close 

 together, the hole having a diameter of about fifteen feet. The 

 stones are of moderate size, composed of a dark silex, and evi- 

 dently derived from the drift material brought down from the 

 Uinta Mountains, w'hicli is found on the summits of the bad-land 

 mesas. Five or six miles from this place was found a flint factory 

 with numerous implements and cores. 



Two other circles were observed, in Colorado, about one hun- 

 dred miles east of Long's Peak, and about five miles from a spring- 

 in a well grassed country. They are probably similar in character 

 to those described by Mr. Berthoud in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy (1872-46), as having been seen by him on Crow Creek, 

 Col. The circles are formed of a single row of stones each, are 

 situated close together, and are partially overgrown with grass. 

 They lie in low ground behind a line of flat-topped bluff's, and 

 immediatel}' opposite to a narrow gap or opening between two 6i 

 them. No implements were found, and he could form no opinion 

 as to their age. The locality is unsuitable for a camp, in conse- 

 quence of the remoteness of wood and water. The country is not 

 inhabited by Indians, the nearest, a temporary camp, for travelling 

 Cheyennes, Sioux, etc., being fort}' miles distant. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3T1 



Prof. Cope explained the scope of the paper read by him as 

 follows: The types of molar teeth are considered to be four, viz., 

 the simple conic or truncate (Haplodont) ; the sides of the crown 

 vertically plicate (Ptychodont) ; the apex of the crown tuberculate 

 (Bunodont) ; or plicate (Lophodont). The Bunodonts were re- 

 garded as either with opposite or alternate, or few or man}' 

 tubercles. The Lophodonts were considered in respect to their 

 superior and inferior teeth separateh', and are divided into ani- 

 sognathous, having the maxillary teeth developed more exten- 

 sively than the mandibular, and isognathous, where the develop- 

 ment of the molars in the two jaws is identical. With respect to 

 the structure of the upper molars the}' are found to represent 

 opposite and alternate tubercles, and are hence divided into 

 Antiodont and Ama?bodont series. To the former belong the 

 Selenodont (Ruminant), Tapirodont (Tapir), and Trichecodont 

 (Elephant) types ; to the latter, the Palseotheridonf. Symborodonf^ 

 Bathmodont, and Loxolophodont types. The mandibular teeth are 

 in like manner either antiodont or amoebodont. Of the former 

 kind are Selenodonts^ Hyracodonts (Rhinoceros), and Tricheco- 

 donts (Tapir, Elephant. Manatee, etc.) ; of the latter, Symhorodont 

 (Anchitherinn, Paheotherium, Palffiosyops), Hippodonta (Eqnns), 

 and Loxolopliodont (Bathmodou, Eobasileus) types belong. The 

 Ruminantia are biserial in the essential constitution of the crests 

 of the upper molars ; the Proboscidians (including Bathmodon and 

 Eobcifilens) iiniserial, that is, both series of tubercles uniting to 

 form a simple pattern,"while the Perissodactyles are intermediate 

 in this respect, with the exception of the true horse, which is 

 Selenodont above. 



The genetic relations of the Lophodont teeth are believed to be 

 to corresponding types of the Bunodonts, and connecting series 

 from the tyi^ical forms of the latter to corresponding genera of the 

 former are shown to exist in most cases, rendering the i)robability 

 of descent very strong. It results that Bunodonts and Lopho- 

 donts form " homologous groups,"' and are therefore related geneti- 

 cally, as had been pointed out by the writer some years ago. The 

 mandibular dental characters of the Eocene genera Achseiiodon 

 and Hyopsodus are shown to conform to the antiodont and amoebo- 

 dont types of the bunodont pattern respectively. 



The types of extremital structure have nearly similar relations, 

 but are much further reaching in application, each of the divisions 

 Artiodaclyla, Proboscidia, and PerisnodarAyla embracing both Bu- 

 nodonts and Lophodonts. The probable or theoretical ancestral 

 types of Bathmodon and Eobasileus are suggested, as well as that 

 of the whole of the Jlammalia — Educabilia, or Gyre7icephala, in- 

 cluding man. This is necessarily a pentadactyle plantigrade bu- 

 nodont, probably isognathous, and with cerebral convolutions 

 much reduced.

Disposition of the Flexor perforans^ Flexor longus hallucis, and 

 Flexor accessorius in Paradoxurus musanga Gra}'. — Dr. H. C. 

 Chapman made the following remarks : — 



I have pleasure in calling the attention of the members of the 

 Academ}' to the arrangement of the Flexor 

 longus hallucis and Flexor accessorius in the 

 Musanga. For the opportunity of dissecting 

 the animal I am indebted to the Directors of 

 the Zoolosrical Garden. Usually in pentadac- 

 tyle animals tliere is found a muscle, the Flexor 

 longus hallucis, which, rising from the fibula, 

 passes down to the sole of the foot, and after 

 giving a slip to the Flexor perforans is inserted 

 into the hallux. In man and some other ani- 

 mals, there also exists a muscle, the Flexor 

 accessorius, which, rising from the calcaueum, 

 is inserted into the conjoined tendon of the 

 Flexor perforans and Flexor longus hallucis. 

 The names of these muscles indicate their func- 

 tion. In the Musanga, however, the muscle 5, 

 which is homologous with the Flexor longus 

 hallucis of man, etc., simply fuses with the ten- 

 don of the Flexor perforans, A^ while the Flexor 

 accessorius, C, after giving off muscular slips to 

 the Flexor brevis digitornm, terminates in a tendon which is in- 

 serted into the hallux. The Flexor accessorius acts, therefore,

the part of the Flexor longus hallucis, while the latter muscle is

 in question belongs to Lycoi'ina^ I add a description of the form 

 and sculpture.

Fertilization of Yucca. — Mr. Thomas Meehan detailed at length 

 the discoveries of Dr. Engelmann and Prof. Riley in regard to the 

 fertilization of the Yucca by the aid of a small night moth, 

 Fronuba yuccasella of Riley, and observed that in this region the 

 fertilization was effected by this insect every year. In the Rocky 

 Mountains of Colorado in 1871, he saw the Yucca angustifolia, 

 everywhere seeding in great abundance ; but in his journey in 1873, 

 he saw not a solitary seed-vessel in any of the plants, and he sug- 

 gested that perhaps some periodical insect might take the place 

 of the Pronuba in that country. 



Note on a Fungoid Root Parasite. — Mr. Thomas Meehan ex- 

 hibited a small Norway spruce, in which the branches and leaves 

 were all of a golden tint. He explained that when plants had 

 little food, or lost their fibres in wet soil by which they could not 

 make use of food, the yellow tint was generally exhibited in the 

 leaves of plants. The similarity of the appearances suggesting, 

 he examined and found the roots thickly enveloped bj' the my- 

 celia of a fungus, which destroyed the young fibres as fast as they 

 were developed. Onl}^ a few trees had been attacked two years 

 ago ; but last season and this the fungus had spread underground 

 from one plant to another, till now there were over a hundred 

 in the diseased condition of the one exhibited. He had supposed 

 it was one of the small microscopic forms of fungi; but in Oc- 

 tober of the present year, the mycelia developed into a brown agaric 

 with a pileus about two inches broad, but the exact species of which 

 he could not positively determine. The mycelia of some of the 

 larger fungi would destroy the roots of grasses, as in the well- 

 known case of " fairj^ rings;" and he believed the Gardener^s 

 Chronicle had conclusively shown that trees were also injuriously 

 affected by some of them ; but he thought that it had not before 

 been so directly proved in the case of American trees. 



He suggested, that, as the phenomena in the case of the trouble- 

 some disease known to American cultivators as the peach "yellows" 

 were all similar, those who had the opportunity to examine might 

 find the roots affected by a fungus in the same way.

On the Expansion of the Coma in Asclepiadaceae. — Mr. Thomas 

 Meehan exhibited some seed-vessels of Gonolobus obliquus, and re- 

 marked, that, though the hairv appendage to the seed known as the 

 Coma in asclepiadaceous plants was of course well understood, 

 he knew of no one who had placed on record any observation in 

 regard to the suddenness of the expansion after the seed left the 

 capsule. It was indeed so very rapid, that the common expres- 

 sion of "like a stroke of lightning," was scarcely- an exaggeration. 

 It was only with diflScult}- that the eye could follow the motion. 

 In the seed-vessel each set of long silk}' hair was drawn up into a 

 close linear fascicle ; but on the instant of the seed being relieved 

 from its case, the coma expanded into a perfect hemisphere. 

 Some of the hair formed a right angle, and others more or less 

 acute ones, each seeming to have its fixed place to fall back to. 



It was generally supposed that these hairj- appendages and 

 others of a similar character in seeds, were for the express purpose 

 of aiding in seed distribution by wind ; but he had failed in so 

 many instances to see the adA'antages, that it often seemed as 

 if it were the seed profiting bv developed organs, rather than 

 that these were especially" formed for an express purpose. 

 The wings of the linden and maple, for instance, give a peculiar 

 spiral motion to the descent of the seed, without any apparent 

 benefit to the seed from the spiral motion ; while the wing, espe- 

 cialh' in the case of the linden, did not carry the seed far away. 

 But in this case of the Gonolobus, it did seem as if there were 

 better grounds than perhaps in an}' other case for believing that 

 the hairy appendage is designed expressly- to facilitate distribution 

 bj' wind or air currents. The seeds are heavj-, and are borne on 

 the plant but a few feet from the ground : the}' would fall there 

 in a few seconds on the opening of the capsule, if the mass of 

 hair remained long in its closelj' compact condition. It was indeed 

 absolutely essential, to be of an}' use at all as an aid to the wind, 

 the expansion should be immensely rapid. He thought it the most 

 perfect illustration of express design he knew in the vegetable 

 kingdom. 



On Lingula in a Fish of the Susquehanna. — Prof. Leidy re- 

 marked that Dr. Chapman had submitted to his examination 

 several entozoa, together with portions of the stomach and intes- 

 tine, of a yellow Pike-perch, Schizostedion, or Lucioperca ameri- 




416 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



cana. The fish had been caught in the Susquehanna River, at 

 Duncannon, Pa. In the stomach there was found a large shell of 

 Lingula j^yraviidata, which heretofore had not been discovered 

 inhabiting our coast further north than North Carolina. The 

 yellow Pike-perch was generall}' considered to be altogether a 

 fresh-water fish. The presence of the lingula in the stomach 

 would indicate that it was at least a visitor to the sea, and in the 

 case of the present fish, probably as far down as the North Carolina 

 coast.

 Twenty-four members present. 



Remarks on Fossil Elephant Teeth. — Prof. Leidy observed that 

 the fossil elephant teeth, presented this evening by Mr. Richard 

 Peters, were obtained bj' him in Mexico. In appearance the fossils 

 resemble some others, obtained in New Mexico and Chihuahua, 

 referred to in his recent work, " Contributions to the Extinct 

 Vertebrate Fauna of the Western Territories." All appear to have 

 pertained to the coarse-plated variety of molars referred to a 

 species by Dr. Falconer with the name of Elephas Columbi. Some 

 of the specimens had been found in association with remains of 

 the Mastodon, the extinct and near relative of the elephant. 



The two genera were cotemporaneous, and were represented by 

 many species during the middle and later tertiarj" pei'iods, but no 

 remains of either have yet been discovered in the early tertiar}'^ 

 deposits. It is probable that both are successors from a common 

 stock which existed at a period intermediate to that in which were 

 formed the known eocene and miocene deposits. The elephant has 

 survived the mastodon, as represented in the living species of 

 Asia and Africa to-daj'. In this countrv, the comparative abun- 

 dance and excellent state of preservation of remains of the mastodon 

 in post-tertiar}' deposits, would apparenth' indicate that it had 

 survived the elephant. The mastodon had the ontward form and 

 the general construction of the living elephant. Like it, it was a 

 bulky, five-toed animal, with a long prehensile proboscis, and with 

 long tusks to the upper jaw. 



The molar teeth in the two genera diflfer in a striking manner, 

 and so widely, that early observers thought those of the mastodon 

 were adapted to a carnivorous habit. The actual number of 

 molars is the same in both, but generall}' those of the functional 

 series, or those in use at any one time, are more numerous in the 

 mastodon than in the elephant. In this the molars are bulky, 

 laminated masses inserted in the jaws without fangs. In the 

 former the molars have distinct crowns, with prominent transverse 

 lobes, inserted with long, strong fangs. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 417 



Xotwithstanding the difference it is easy to see that one form 

 is the derivative of the other, and it is probable that the elephan- 

 tine form was evolved from the mastodont form, as the teeth of 

 the mastodon are of a more ancient pattern or type, that is to say, 

 the}- accord more nearly with the usual pattern of the molars of 

 ancient pachyderms. 



B3' simple multiplication of the transverse lobes of the molar 

 crowns of the mastodon, contracting these lobes, elongating them 

 so as to encroach on the position of the fangs, and filling the 

 intervals with cementura, we have the elephant molars produced. 

 The miocene stegodons of the Himalayas were elephants with 

 teeth decidedly of intermediate character in these respects, with 

 the true elephants and the mastodons. 



This mode of complication of the molar teeth in the evolution 

 of the elephant pattern from the mastodon pattern was a very 

 common one among the ungulates. Most of the early ruminants, 

 as Oreodon, Agriochoerus, etc., and the solipeds, as Anchitherium, 

 had molars with short crowns and prominent lobes, inserted with 

 fangs. Their successors, as exemplified in most living ruminants 

 and the horses, have molars with long crowns, complicated in the 

 same manner as we observe in the elephant as compared with the 

 mastodon. 



Nearly all our domestic herbivorous ungulates belong to genera 

 having long-crowned, complicated molars, as exemplified in the 

 elephant, horse, camel, ox, sheep, and goat. The deer retains the 

 more ancient pattern of molars. 



That the course of evolution was from the more simple to the 

 more complicated type would appear to be confirmed in the fact 

 that the temporary molars have proportionately shorter crowns 

 and longer roots than in those of the permanent series. 



The death of Prof. Agassiz was announced by the Chair, and a 

 committee consisting of Drs. Le Conte, Carson, and Leidy was

The following paper was presented for publication : — 

 " On Three Xew Species of Unionidae of the United States." 

 By Isaac Lea. 



Prof. Cope made some remarks on fishes from the coal mea- 

 sures at Linton. Ohio. He stated that Prof. Xewberry, Director 

 of the Geological Survey of Ohio, had sent to him numerous 




418 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



specimens of fishes and batrachians for determination and de- 

 scription. Among tiiese he had discovered batrachians {Colos- 

 teus, Cope) which were labelled and had been described as fishes 

 {Pygopterus sciiteUatus, Newb.), and fishes (Conchiopsis and 

 Peplorhina, Cope) some of which were labelled " Amphibian or 

 Reptilian." Having determined the latter to be fishes and de- 

 scribed them, Prof. Cope now called attention to a note of Prof. 

 Newberry on the latter, read at the last meeting of the Academy, 

 in which he states, (1) that Peplorhina anthracina is a batrachian ; 



(2) that it is identical with Conchiopsis exanthematicus^ Cope; 



(3) that G. fiUferus is Coelacanfhus elegans^ Newb. ; (4) that the 

 dentition described by me is not that of Coelacanthus ; and that 

 (5) the genus is the same as that described by Agassiz forty 

 years ago as Coelacanthus. 



To these propositions Prof. Cope replied, that (1) Additional 

 evidence derived from two specimens of Pep)lorhina anthracina^ 

 Cojae, recently studied, confirms the view that it is a fish, which 

 evidence is given below; (2) That neither of the two specimens 

 exhibits in its cranial bones the characters of C. exanthematicus, 

 though both sides are exhibited. Thej' show, however, that the 

 latter should be referred to the genus Peplorhina, since among 

 other points they present the same type of teeth, which I find 

 labelled on one of them "ova?"; (3) Prof. Newberry's identi- 

 fication of the species C. filiferus with Coelacanthus elegans is 

 doubtless correct ;' but (4 and 5) Its reference (with that of similar 

 species) to Agassiz's genus is not warranted, until it is found to 

 possess an osseous natatory bladder (which Prof. N. states in the 

 Geological Surve}' of Ohio that he could not find in any of his 

 five hundred specimens), and osseous ribs and the type of denti- 

 tion are discovered in Coelacanthus granulatus, the tj'pe of the 

 genus. 



One of the new specimens of Peplorhina'^ displays the lower 

 side of the cranium, and on it two large jugular bones, one on 

 each side, on the inner side of the mandible. They are elongate, 

 the posterior border oblique, so as to present an apex on the 

 inner side ; the inner edge is thin, the outer thickened ; the surface 

 smooth, with a very obscure longitudinal striation. Between 

 their anterior extremities is a subround disciform bone in the po- 

 sition of the basi or glosso-hyal. The mandibular rami extend 

 round its anterior margin, and posteriorly nearly to the end of 

 the jugular. The sj'mphysis is a curious interdigitation of three 

 fingers into as many notches, and the dentaries near them are 

 marked with sj'^mmetrical pores, which look like the exits of 

 mucous ducts. Three are on the superior, and two on the in- 

 ferior margin of the bone, and a sixth is immediately between the 



' Though no one could suppose so from his imperfect figure, Geol. Surv. 

 Ohio, PI. 40, Fig. 1.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 419 



upper and lower inner ones. These pores correspond with the 

 mucous ducts of the lateral line observed in the scales of the t^-pe. 

 The teeth are niiraeronsh' placed in a patch on the vomer, or at 

 least the roof of the mouth, and are short, conic, acute, and 

 smooth. They are discoverable as far backwards as the anterior 

 end of the jugular plates. The large opercular bones are smooth, 

 and the head is covered above with nearly smooth, thin scuta. 

 The head is wide behind, and though contracted forwards, the 

 muzzle is broadly obtuse. Irregular masses, perhaps remains 

 of cartilage, follow the skull in which a few ribs are scattered. 



The other specimen displays the smooth operculum patch of 

 vomerine teeth, and several separated scuta of the surface of the 

 cranium. These have rounded angles, one or more convex sides, 

 and very obscure radiating ridges. 



The characters relied on as indicative of the reference of Pep- 

 lorhina to the fishes, are (1) the presence of opercula like those 

 of Conchiopsis ; (2) the presence of jugular bones, and (3) of 

 oval imbricated scales ; (4) the absence of ambulatory limbs. 

 The thin scutiform cranial bones, the dense patch of vomerine 

 teeth, and the mucous ducts of the bones and scales were all 

 ichthyic characters. As no limbs had been discovered in three 

 specimens preserved in the appropriate regions, their nature, if 

 existing, could not be determined at present. 



Prof. Cope brought before the Academy some results derived 

 from study of material obtained hy him during the preceding 

 summer in the miocene formations of Colorado. He announced 

 the discovery of the first fossil monkey of the miocene of America, 

 giving it the name of Menotheriurti lemurinum. He regarded it 

 as allied to the Tomitheriinn of the Bridger Eocene, and as the 

 representative of the more numerous group of the lemuroids, 

 which he had discovered in the latter formation. He stated that 

 there are three tubercular molars and a sectorial-like premolar in 

 front of them ; that this tooth is preceded either by a more elongate 

 premolar with two roots, or by two single-rooted premolars. 

 The molars each support four tubercles in nearly opposite 

 pairs, the inner anterior connected with the outer posterior 

 by a diagonal ridge ; the last premolar compressed with obtuse 

 apex, broad heel, and anterior tubercle. Size that of a domestic 

 cat. Prof. Cope stated that his recent discovery of snakes, 

 lizards, and lemurs of forms allied to those previously discovered 

 by Prof. Marsh and himself in the Eocene of W3'oming. consti- 

 tuted points of aflflnit}' to the fauna of that period not previously 

 suspected. He also observed that he had discovered some addi- 

 tional species of Ruminantia allied to the musk, and to the Lepto- 

 vieryx evansii^ Leidy, which he named Hypisodus minimus, and 

 Hyperfragulufi calcaratus^ and H. tricosiatus. The first was the 

 least of the order, not exceeding a cat-squirrel in size. Hyper- 




420 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



tragidua differs from Leptomeryx in tlie isolation of the first 

 premolar, as in the camels, and in the sectorial character of the 

 penultimate premolar. The temporary premolars had the form 

 of the pennant corresponding teeth in Leptomeryx. 



Prof. Cope also mentioned two interesting observations on 

 Ungulate species of the Western Pliocene formation. He found 

 that the horses of the genus Protohippus were provided with 

 three toes, as in Hippotherium ; skeletons of P. sejanctus, Cope, 

 and P. placidus, Leidy, having furnished the parts in question. 



The other fact ascertained was the existence of a complete 

 series of superior incisor teeth in certain camels of the same period. 

 The observation was made on the cranium of an adult Procamelus 

 hete7'odontus, Cope, sp. nov. The alveoli were completely pi'e- 

 served, but it was thought that their appearance indicated the 

 easy shedding of the teeth. 



On Circulatory Moveinent in Vaucheria. — Prof. Leidy made 

 some remarks on the intra-cellular circulation of plants, as exem- 

 plified in the hairs of the Mullein, the leaf-cells of Yallisneria, etc. 

 The moving streams of protoplasm he likened to amoeboid move- 

 ments, and expressed the opinion that they were of the same 

 character. In the common alga, Vaucheria^ the filaments of which 

 consist of ver}' long cells, comparable to those of Nitella or Chara, 

 he had observed an apparent motion of the cell contents, whicli 

 is somewhat peculiar and, at least, is not generally mentioned by 

 writers. The wall of the cells is invested on the interior with a 

 layer of tenacious protoplasm, containing the thinner liquid cell 

 contents as usui^l. The parietal protoplasm is closely paved with 

 green granules, and these appear very slowl}- but incessantly to 

 change their position in relation with one anothei*. The motion is 

 so slow that it was a question for some time whether it did actually 

 occur, but it appears suflSciently obvious if observed in relation 

 with the lines of a mici'ometer, and its existence was confirmed by 

 several friends whose attention was directed to it. 



In behalf of the committee. Prof. Carson made the following 

 report: — 



In accordance with the resolutions passed at the last meeting of 

 the Academy, upon the announcement by the chairman of the 

 death of Prof. Agassiz, that a committee be appointed to prepare 

 such a testimonial as would express the sentiment of the Academy 

 upon the loss of so distinguished a member, and be proper to be 

 placed upon the minutes as a record of the high appreciation en- 

 tertained by it of his services to science, the committee reports the 

 following: — 



Resolved, That in the death of Professor Louis John Rudolph 

 Agassiz the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has 

 lost one of the most illustrious of the associates whose names have 

 graced the list of members of the institution. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 421 



Resolved, That the Academy fully recognizes the fact that by 

 the death of one whose works and reputation shed lustre upon the 

 l^ursuit of natural science, not only this country, but the intellec- 

 tual world, has sustained a loss which will not easily be replaced. 



Resolved, That, with the grief we would express for his loss as 

 one of the most eminent of modeiTi naturalists, we cannot with- 

 hold the attestation of our gratitude for the course he took of 

 becoming a citizen of the United States, and for his untiring de- 

 votion to the development of the natural history of this continent, 

 thus having identitied himself with American science, of which he 

 was a leading and most successful explorer. 



Resolved, That while his life and career were models to be imi- 

 tated by the student of nature, his genial temper, estimable quali- 

 ties and high honorable motives as a man endeared him to all who 

 came within iiis influence, and have left the most pleasurable rec- 

 ollections of his person and character. 



Resolved, That we deeply sympatliize with those in whose im- 

 mediate behalf and for whose advancement his talents and energy 

 have been expended, and express the hope that the impulse he has 

 given to their labors ma}* be continued, and that the interest he 

 aroused within the immediate circle of his efforts may not be lost, 

 but continue as a tribute to his worth and the perpetuation of his 

 fame. 



Resolved, That we fully appreciate the extent of the bereave- 

 ment which, under Providence, has befallen the famih* and friends 

 of Prof. Agassiz. and beg to express our heartfelt participation iu 

 the sorrow experienced b}' them. 



The resolutions were adopted unanimousl}*, and the President 

 of the Society was instructed to transmit a copy of them to the 

 widow of Prof Asassiz.

NOTES ON THE GENUS CONCHIOPSIS, Cope. 

 BY J. S. NEWBERY. 



In the Proceedings of the Academy of I^atural Sciences 

 (1873, Part II. page 340), I find descriptions by Prof. Cope 

 of some fossil fishes from the Coal Measures of Ohio, which 

 seem to require a word of comment. A large collection of am- 

 phibian remains which I obtained from Ohio, I sent to Prof. Cope 

 for description, informing him that the fossil fislies found with 

 them had been, or would be, described by myself. Among the 

 amphibian remains sent to Prof. Cope a few fishes were accidentallj'' 

 included. These he has described in the place referred to. To 

 receive them he has constructed the new genus Gonchiopsis^ Cope, 

 and describes under it three species ; C Jiiiferus, Cope ; C. angu- 

 liferus. Cope, and G. exanthematicus, Cope. He also describes 

 another genus, Feplorhina, of which he defines one species (P. 

 anthracina^ Cope). Since these descriptions were published, the 

 specimens have been returned to me. On examining them, I find — 



1st. That Prof. Cope's genus Gonchiopsis is identical with 

 Agassiz's Gcelacanthus, described in his Poissons Fossiles, Tom. 

 II., Par. 2, page 170. The genus is still further and more 

 fully illustrated by Huxley in The Memoirs of the Geological 

 Survey of the United Kingdom, Decades X and XII. 



2d. Prof. Cope's species G. filiferus and G. anguUferus, both 

 belong to the species Goelacanthus elegans, described by me in the 

 Proceedings of the Acad, of Nat. Sciences, Philadelphia, April, 

 1856, and more fully illustrated in the first volume of the final 

 report of the Geological Survey of Ohio, Part II., Paleontology, 

 page 337, pi. 40. 



3d. The "gular plates" referred to by Prof. Cope in his descrip- 

 tion of Gonchiopsis, are really the opercula ; the jugular plates 

 — which he has apparently not seen — are long — elliptical, some- 

 times almost linear in outline. 



4th. The dentition which Prof. Cope attributes to Gcelacanthus 

 ( Gonchiopsis, Cope) is not the true dentition of the genus, as he 

 has drawn his inference from the dentition of his G. exanthema- 

 ticus, which is not a Gcelacanthus. 



5th. The species referred to above, Gonchiopsis exanthematicus, 

 28 




426 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



Cope, is identical with his Peplor-hina anthracina. The chief dis- 

 tinction made by him : the ditference in the surfaces of what he 

 calls the " gular shields" — in one case gjnooth, in the other granu- 

 lated or pustular — is due simply to the exposure, in one case, of 

 the inside, and the other, the external and ornamented surface of 

 the cheek plates as they are, and not jugulars as he considers 

 them. 



6th. The material representing Prof. Cope's genus Ppplorhina 

 is too imperfect for satisfactory study, Ijut, in my judgment, it 

 represents an amphibian and not a fish. 



I ought, perhaps, to say in justification of the somewhat posi- 

 tive manner in which the above statements are made, that they 

 are based upon a careful study of an immense amount of material 

 which I have been gathering from Linton during the last twenty 

 years. The richness of this material may be inferred when I say 

 that of the species especially referred to in the above note, Cte/a- 

 canlhus elegans, I have obtained more than 500 specimens.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



THE LIBRARIAN'S REPORT. 



The Librarian respectfully reports that 1336 additions to the 

 library have been made during the j'ear 1878. 



Of these 299 were volumes, 1031 pamphlets and parts of peri- 

 odicals, and 6 maps and charts, etc.; 1052 were octavos, 241 

 quartos, 22 duodecimos, 15 folios, and 6 maps. 



They were derived from the following sources : —

One hundred and eighteen were purchased. The 58 volumes 

 from the late Elias Durand, including a collection of valuable 

 pamphlets in six volumes, were bequeathed to the Academj^: his 

 wish was that the}' should be kept in the Botanical Room, for the 

 convenience of those working in the Herbarium ; and in com- 

 pliance w'ith this intention a separate catalogue of these books 

 has been prepared. 



The additions to the librarj' were distributed to the several 

 departments as follows : —

307 volumes have been bound. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 429 



The catalogues of the works on Geolog}-, Eutomolog}', and 

 General Natural History have been careful!}' revised, and the en- 

 tries in the first named, numbering 1902-titles exclusive of cross- 

 references, have been arranged in alpliabetii-al order, ready for 

 transcribing. 5.S8 Geological pamphlets have been indexed and 

 bound in 31 volumes; and 164 pamphlets on General Natural 

 Histor}' have been arranged in 12 volumes. 



In the department of Journals and Periodicals the cases and 

 shelves have been numbered, and the position of each work indi- 

 cated on a new catalogue, which has been completed and is here- 

 with presented. The numbers are merely provisional, as the 

 amount of shelf room in this section of the librarj'^ is entirely too 

 small to permit of a proper display of the volumes. Whilst the 

 old arrangement in this department has not been altered, it is yet 

 hoped that the reference to the case and shelf will fticilitate the 

 finding of Journals, which, in the mere geographical classification, 

 might readil}' be overlooked. The entries in this catalogue number 

 763. 



The librar}' has been kept open in the evenings until 10 o'clock 

 since the 2d of last April. The attendance of members has been 

 small, but the additional time at the disposal of the librarian has 

 given him an opportunity of finishing much of the work above 

 reported, the greater part of which would be still incomplete had 

 his attendance been confined to the morning hours, as formerly. 

 All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edavard J. Nolan. Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



But little change has been made in the Museum of the Academy 

 towards the arrangement in general of its collections since the 

 presentation of the last annual report. Under the voluntary and 

 assiduous labor of the committee of arrangement of the Concho- 

 logical Section, the conchological cabinet has been completely 

 arranged and labelled, and may now be regarded as in better con- 

 dition than any other collection of the Museum. For a special 

 account of that cabinet, and the additions made to it daring the 

 year, we refer to the Report of the Conservator of the Concho- 

 logical Section. 



The Curators regret to state that several of the collections of 




430 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



the Museum have recently suffered from the depredations of a 

 thief, but are also pleased to add that the latter has been appre- 

 hended, and it is believed that all the stolen articles have been 

 recovered. 



The contributions towards the Museum during the year are as 

 follows : — 



Mammals. — A Porpoise, from the Delaware River, was pre- 

 sented by Dr. H. C. Chapman. An Ant-eater, a Sloth, an Opos- 

 sum, and a Howling Monke}', from Guinea, were presented by 

 Capt. R.. S. Henwood ; and three monkeys from the same country 

 were presented by Mr. Frank Guckert. As a donation from the 

 Smithsonian Institution we received a collection of American 

 Muridae, consisting of a box of skins and two jars of specimens in 

 alcohol. Mr. Nathaniel H. Bishop presented two specimens, 

 male and female, of Spermophilus Franklinii, caught in Ocean 

 Co., New Jerse}- ; and Dr. L. Fussel presented a Black Rat, Mus 

 7'attus, caught near Philadelphia. 



Birds. — Five skins of Toucans, from Guinea, were presented 

 by Mr. F. Guckert. Specimens of a recentl}^ described variety of 

 Buteo borealis, called Krider's Hawk, male and female, were 

 presented by Mi*. John Krider. The nest of the common Hum- 

 ming-bird, was presented by Col. F. M. Etting. 



Beptiles, Bafrachians, and Fishes. — A collection of reptiles and 

 fishes, contained in 21 jars, from the Viti Isles, was presented by 

 Andrew J. Garrett. Another collection, in 12 jars, from Wyo- 

 ming, was presented by Prof. E. D. Coi)e. Others were presented 

 as follows: A collection of reptiles, in 6 jars, from Venezuela, 

 by L. M. Davis ; the skin of a large serpent, two other snakes and 

 a lizard, from Guinea, by F. Guckert ; 3 jars of fishes, from 

 Wyoming, by Dr. Leidj-; 2 fishes and a snake, from Peru, bj- 

 Thomas M. Cleemann ; an Amblystoma, from Utah, by Dr. H. C. 

 Chapman ; and a Gra^'ling, from Michigan, b}' Mr. Thaddeus 

 Norris. 



Osteological Specimens. — Skeletons of a Cap^'bara, a Kangaroo, 

 a Fisher, a Pine Martin, an American Badger, and a Black Si)ider 

 Monkey were purchased for the Museum. Nine skeletons of birds, 

 from St. Paul's Island, Alaska, from the Elliot collection, were 

 donated b}' the Smithsonian Institution. Skulls of a Crocodile 

 and a Tapir, and the hyoid of a Howler, from Guiana, were pre- 

 sented by F. Guckert. A fine large skull of the Rocky Mountain

 Isaac Lea. Numerous remains of Palaeosj'ops, Hyrachyus, Uinta- 

 therium, Erays, Testudo, Trionyx, etc., obtained from the tertiary 

 beds in the vicinity of Fort Bridger, Wyoming, were collected, on 

 account of the Academy, during tlie last summer, by Dr. J. Van 

 A. Carter and Dr. Leidy, part of the expense of the expedition 

 having been defrayed b}^ Joseph Jeanes and Isaac Lea.

REPORT OF RECORDER OF BIOLOGICAL AND 

 MICROSCOPICAL SECTION. 



Adopted Decemhcr 1st, 1873, and forwarded to the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences as the Report of the Section for the current year. 



In presenting our Annual Report for the j'ear 1813, I think we 

 have again great reason to congratulate ourselves upon the amount 

 of original observation and experiments which has been brought 

 forward by our members, placed on record in our proceedings, 

 and given to the world, chiefl3Mn the columns of the Philadelj^hia 

 Medical Times. For whilst it is true that a smaller number of 

 elaborately prepared essays have been laid before us the past 

 twelve months than in former years, there has, undoubtedly, been 

 elicited in our discussions a much larger amount and variety of 

 that individual opinion and experience which form the essential 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 433 



Objects of any such society for the systematic observation of na- 

 tural phenomena as ours, and the expression of wliich constitutes 

 the true life of everj^ similar association. 



The interesting report of Dr. Albert Fricke upon the " Horse 

 Epidemic of October and Xovember. 1872," read before our De- 

 cember meeting of last year, and published in the Medical Times, 

 was followed in January b3- the useful essa}^ of Dr. J. Gibbons 

 Hunt, " On the Preparation and Preservation of Vegetable 

 Tissues," comprising a complete exposition of the method for 

 mounting objects in Damar, which has of late proved so valuable 

 to microscopists. In connection with this communication, Dr. 

 Hunt showed specimens of the common Truffle, discovered grow- 

 ing wild near Philadelphia by himself, for the first time, as far as 

 we are aware, in America. 



The February meeting was occupied with the reading and dis- 

 cussion of Dr. James T^'son's able paper, " On the Microscopic 

 Study of Blood and Epithelium," embodying some of the results 

 of the author's observations in Europe, in the laboratories of 

 Strieker and Klein, and since devek>ped, in accordance with 

 nature's great law of tlie survival of the fittest, into an excellent 

 introduction to practical histology. 



Mr. Danl. S. Holman sul)mitted to us in March his ingenious 

 moist slide for the examination of blood, pus, etc., wliose practical 

 application was admirably sliown the following month, at the veiy 

 satifactoi'y exhibition of microscopes, microscopical apparatus, 

 and specimens, given by the Section in the Hall of the Academy, 

 and attended by a large number of members and citizens, includ- 

 ing many ladies, who apj^eared much interested in the wonders of 

 the microscopic world. 



In May, Dr. J. Gr. Hunt contributed a very practical communi- 

 cation, " On the Use of Hfematoxylon in the Preparation of Stain- 

 ings of both Vegetable and Animal Tissues," and in June exhi- 

 bited a common Stellate Hair, sent to him as an extraordinary 

 ingredient of vomited matter, which gave rise to an interesting 

 and important debate upon Dr. Charlton Bastian's researches in 

 regard to the Beginnings of Life. 



The curious putridity of the water in the reservoir at the Cam- 

 den Water Works, which presented an insoluble problem to vari- 

 ous scientists, was demonstrated during the summer, by Dr. J. G. 

 Hunt, to be due to the growth of a Xostoc, the Trichormus 




434 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Thompsoni, and at the October meeting he exhibited specimens of 

 the plant, and suggested a method of preventing its development, 

 which, if adopted, may economize expenditure to the amount of 

 thousands of dollars, for our own and other municipal authorities. 

 Finally, at our last meeting, several short communications were 

 brought forward, among the most important of which were Dr. 

 Tyson's exhibition and account of Echinococci, and Dr. J. H. 

 McQuillen's observations on a remarkable case of Dilaceration of 

 the Crown of an Incisor Tooth. 



All of which is respectfully submitted, 



Jos. G. Richardson, Recorder. 



REPORT OF CONSERVATOR OF CONCHOLOGICAL 

 SECTION. 



The Conservator of the Conchological Section respectfully re- 

 ports that the donations to the Cabinet, during the past year, have 

 been as follows : —

Lea, Pearson's Creek, Mo. 

 WiLLCox. Jos. Helix albolabris, S. W. Xorth Carolina. 



The work of the Committee on the arrangement of the Cabinet 

 has been prosecuted during the year with extraordinarj- industry, 

 and it affords your Conservator livel}' satisfaction to be able to 

 report the conclusion of the Committee's labors, and the complete 

 arrangement of the collection of shells. At the end of 1873, 

 40,873 specimens of 6893 species had been supplied with 12.067 

 labels, and placed systematicallj^ in the cases. During the past 

 3'ear 85,606 specimens of 7268 species bave been cleansed, oiled, 

 and arranged in trays, and 12,218 labels written, thus showing a 

 larger amount of work done in this one year than had been com- 

 pleted in the six preceding years. The collection is, probablj', in 

 every respect the finest in the world, and represents nearly all the 

 good species described ; a very large synonym^' — amounting to, 

 perhaps, several thousand names — being eliminated during the 

 progress of arrangement. Many of the families and genera are 

 very complete. Among those arranged this year, the Unionidffi 

 may be mentioned, consisting of 783 species and 3592 specimens 

 contained in 1555 trap's. 



Dr. Hassler has continued to arrange the duplicate specimens 

 for sale, and reports the total number of lots placed in the hands 

 of Mr. Kline to December 4, to be 4936, valued at S796. The 

 total amount received from sales is $171. This, together with 

 sundry contributions from members, has been used in procuring 

 144 drawers, which have been placed under the horizontal cases 

 to permit of the extended arrangement of the collection. 




436 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



About SfiS species have been sent to Chicago to assist in replac- 

 ing the collection of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, lately de- 

 stroyed by fire, and upwards of 100 additional species are now 

 ready for transmission. These have all been correctly detei'mined 

 and named. 



In thus announcing the completion of the labor of seven years, 

 this report would not be complete if special mention were not 

 made of the gentlemen who have devoted so much of their time 

 and skill to the work. A bare statement of the fact that every 

 one of the 14,161 species contained in the collection has been 

 separately and carefully' examined by Mr. Trj'on, that he has de- 

 termined nearly all the species not hitherto named, and verified 

 the names already given, will be sufHcient to show how much the 

 Academ}' is indebted to him for his unflagging industry. To the 

 taste and skill of Mr. Parker, who has thus employed most of the 

 time not occupied b}' other duties, is mainly due the admirable 

 manner in which the specimens are so arranged as to exhibit the 

 specific characters without the necessity of handling. Mr. Roberts 

 has also devoted much of his leisure time to the same work, while 

 the report of what has been done b}^ Dr. Hassler in the disposition 

 of the duplicates, bears ample testimony to his industry. 



It is already well known to the members of the Society that this 

 labor has been entirely voluntary. It has been, in truth, a labor 

 of love, and the elegance of the arrangement, no less than' the 

 comparative completeness of the collection, is sufficient evidence 

 of the earnestness with which all concerned have fulfilled their 

 self-imposed task. 



All of which is respectfulh' submitted,
