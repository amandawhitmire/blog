Catalogue of the species of BEMBIDITIM found in the United States and 

 contiguous Northern Kegions. 



BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M. D. 



On revising recently my collection of the species of the genus named above, 

 I regretted to find, that in former years I had been led to describe as distinct 

 species, many which a more practiced eye now leads me to consider as varieties. 

 The number, also, of well-defined species, being very great, I have thought it 

 important to attempt to separate them into definite groups, which, by contain- 

 ing a comparatively small number of species, would facilitate the subsequent 

 labors of the student endeavoring to identify his specimens. 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 3 



With this object in view, I sought the divisions established by Jacquelin Du 

 Val, in his admirable treatise " De Bevibidiis Europacis"* among our own species, 

 but was much disappointed to find them not at all applicable. After repeated 

 trials to reduce a system on the characters of Du Val, which should present a 

 natural series when applied to the species before me, I was at length com- 

 pelled to adopt another method of division, the result of which is presented 

 below. 



But first with regard to the limits of Ochthedromus Lee. and its claims to re- 

 gard as a natural genus. European entomologists have thus far refused to place it 

 in their system, adhering to the view that the subulipalpate Carabica, with few 

 exceptions, (Anillus is received by all, Thalassobius and Tachypus by a few) 

 form but one great genus Bembidium. From this view I ventured to dissent 

 many years ago, but more distinctly in ray notes on the classification of the 

 CarabidiB of the United States,* where the Trechi and Berabidia were widely 

 separated on a difference in the mesothoracic parapleurae ; these in the former 

 are divided by a suture near the posterior margin, and in the latter by a 

 diagonal suture. I also found that in the Trechi the marginal stria of the elytra 

 was interrupted at the middle, while in the Bembidia it was entire. Renewed 

 observation has confirmed the result then obtained, and has induced me still 

 farther to enlarge the group of Trechi, by adding to it not only Tachys, but 

 also Anillus, the form recognized by me as Blemus, (which is probably not 

 genuine Blemus), and Lymnaeum, which has been found on the coast of Cali- 

 fornia, at San Diego. 



Thus of the genera in my table (loc. cit. 39'7) there remains only Pericomp- 

 sus, Bembidium, Octhedromus, Hydrium,''and Patrobus. The last named genus 

 must form a group by itself, or at least separate from Bembidium, and more 

 nearly allied to Pterostichus, or Platynus. Hydrium does not appear to be suf- 

 ficiently definite to be retained. 



Of the three genera thus retained, Pericompsus is known by the antf.rior 

 tarsi of the male being hardly or not at all dilated, by the anterior tibiae being 

 obliquely truncate at tip, and by the elytra being without scutellar strije : the 

 mentum tooth is small and acute. Bembidium and Ochthedromus differ from 

 Pericompsus only by the male having two joints of the anterior tarsi dilated, 

 by the anterior tibise being somewhat rounded at tip, and by the elytra having 

 a short scutellar stria. They differ among themselves by the comparative size 

 of the middle portion of the mentum, which in the species with impressed square 

 spots is longer and broader than in the others, and also in the comparatively 

 larger size of the first dilated joint of the anterior tarsi in the same species. 

 Nevertheless, taking into account the great variations in character, especially of 

 the mentum, in other groups, it seems to me more natural again to unite them 

 into one genus, to be called Bembidium. And with a view of shewing the re- 

 lations between the different groups, the following table may be made use of.

Descriptions of new species. 



28. B. 1 u g ub r e, subdepressum, nigrum obscure virescens, thorace latitu-

 ad basin truncato, angulis posticis subrectis baud rotundatis, fovea utrinque 

 basali profunda parce punctata, elytris striis parum impressis antice punctatis, 

 postice obliteratis, 3ia bipunctata, Vma baud conspicua, ad apicem obsolete 

 piceis ; subtus nigrum, antennarum basi, palpis pedibusque rufis. Long. -28. 



One specimen collected by Mr. Schott in the valley of the Rio Grande. Of the 

 same size as B. transversale, but with the thorax smaller and more narrowed 

 behind ; the stricB of the elytra are less impressed, and the "Zth is altogether 

 wanting. 



45. B. fraternum, depressum, obscure aneo-olivaceum, capite thoraceque 

 subtilissime granulatis, hoc latitudine paulo breviore, postice subangustato, 

 lateribus rotundatis postice breviter sinuatis, angulis rectis carinatis, basi utrin- 

 (^ue bistriato, hand punctato, elytris striis ante medium fere fortiter punctatis, 

 versus apicem subobliteratis, 5ta ad apicem exteusa ; interstitiis planis, 3io bi- 

 punctato ; fasciis duabus undulatis solitis angustis interruptis apicequetestaceis, 

 antennarum articulo Imo pedibusque rufis. Long. -IS. 



One specimen found by me in Habersham County, Georgia. The thorax is 

 formed nearly as in B. viridicolle, and is narrower and more sinuate on the 

 sides than in B. patruele ; from both species it is distinguished by the striaj of 

 the elytra being almost obliterated towards the tip, but tolerably strongly punc- 

 tured at base. 



67. B. pedicellatum, seneo-nigrum, convexum, nitidum, thorace cordato, 

 latitudine breviore, postice maxime angustato, angulis posticis minutis, ad basin 

 pedunculato, marginato, utrinque fovea minuta impresso, elytris punctis majus- 

 culis striatis, pone medium Itevigatis, macula triangulari pallida magna hume- 

 rali utrinque ornatis, antennis palpis pedibusque testaceis. Long. -12. 



One specimen found in Lancaster Co., Pennsylvania, by Mr. S. S. Rathvon. 

 Of the same form and size as B. 4-maculatum, but the elytra are more strongly 

 punctured, and the posterior pale elytral spot (as in B. axillare) is entirely want- 

 ing. Six joints of the antennae that remain, are of a uniform reddish yellow.

BY JOHN L. LECONTE, M. D. 



Having recently procured, after many exertions, a complete copy of the His- 

 toire Naturelle et Iconographie des Insectes Coleopteres, by MM. Laporte and 

 Gory, I have thought that a catalogue of the native species of Buprestidse de- 

 scribed in the work, which has heretofore been inaccessible to the American 

 student, would, perhaps, tend to the more easy recognition of many of our 

 species. In consequence of the confusion which now reigns among the genera 

 of the family mentioned, the time is not yet propitious for a synopsis of all the 

 native species; but with the appearance of the fourth volume of Lacordaire's 

 work on the Genera of Coleoptera, this difficulty will be removed, and the real

characters of the misconceived and wrongly described genera now mentioned in 

 the books will be recognized. In the meantime, however, the synonymical aid 

 to be derived from reference to the monograph of Laporte and Gory must not be 

 overlooked. 



The dates of publication are as follows: vol. 1 ; 1837 ; vols. 2 and 4; 1841.

Becriptions of several new MAMMALS from Western Africa. 



BY JOHN LECONTE. 



Among a large collection of birds sent from Africa by M. du Chaillu, were a 

 few species of Mammals, which have been referred to me for examination. The 

 following is the result of my researches. Some of them appear to be new, at 

 least I cannot find any thing like them described in any book in the possession 

 of the Academy. I have hesitated about naming them, as some of them may be 

 well known in Europe, but imperfectly described. 



Semnopithecus anthracinus. 



Entirely black, hair rather glossy, from two to three inches in length, over 

 the eyes and on the top of the head coarse and bristly. Tragus broad. Thumb 

 of the fore hands a mere oblong tubercle. Nails, except of the hind thumb, long 

 and narrow. Tail very long, slightly tapering towards the point. 



Length 2 feet 2 inches ; tail 2 feet 7 inphes ; arms 1 foot 6 inches ; legs 1 foot 

 9 inches. Seems to resemble the Colobus satanas of Waterhouse, Loud. Mag. 

 for 1838, p. 335, which was brought from the Island of Fernando Po. The length 

 of the hair in the specimen sent to England is stated by the very accurate natu- 

 ralist who describes it to be ten inches, whereas in our animal it rarely in any 

 part exceeds two. 



Cbrcopithecus buccalis. 



Above and on the sides, hair deep cinereous, annulate with rufous beneath, 

 and on the inner parts of the thighs grey. Hair of the head black, annulate like 

 that of the back. Cheeks with a large yellow spot which extends even behind 

 the ear ; behind the eye this spot appears to be bounded above by black. Arms 

 and hands black, the hairs more or less tipped with rufous ; beneath, except 

 near the hands, they are grey. Tail for one-third of its length, above the 

 color of the back, beneath grey ; the rest of the tail is both above and beneath 

 bright rufous, increasing in intensity to the end. Nails long, narrow and com- 

 pressed. No callosities on the rump. 



Length 1 foot 8 inehes ; tail 2 feet 5 inches ; arms 8 inches ; legs 1 foot 2 

 inches. 



MiOROCEBUS ELEGANTULUS. 



Hair soft, dark cinereous, tipped with rufous brown, beneath with grey, the 

 latter color extending somewhat towards the back from the axillae and the groins, 

 and on the forward edge of the legs and thighs; tail longer than the body, cy- 

 lindrical, bushy, the hair tipped with grey, and at its root for about one inch in 

 length with rufous. Nose rather pointed. Ears large, oblong, naked except at the 

 base; lower fore teeth nearly horizontal ; nails of the fore hands round with an 

 acumination ; nail of the hind thumb flat, of the first finger falciform and sharp ; 

 of the other fingers like those on the fore hands. 



Length 8 inches ; tail 12 inches ; head 1 foot 9 inches ; ears I inch. 



Vespertilio pusillus. 



Black, body beneath a little mixed with gray. Head short and small. Upper 

 fore teeth four, distant by pairs, simple ; lower, six, trilobate ; nose not eraarginate. 

 Ears small, oval, orillon lanceolate and rather blunt. Interfemoral membrane 

 naked except at the base; tail projecting a little beyond the membrane. 



Length 1'3 in. ; ears -24; tail -8 ; naked part -05. Extent 6-9. 



[Jan-

SOUBX ODORATUS. 



Dark cinereous brown above inclining to chestnut, beneath slightly paler. 

 Snout proboscidal, deeply emarginate at the point, and furrowed on the under 

 side. Ears large, naked, with two rather large lobes within, the lower one of 

 which appears to be the antitragus ; tail long, triangular. 



Length 5 inches ; head 1-G5 ; tail 2-6 ; ears -2. 



This species has a very strong musky odor. 



SCIURUS SUBVIRIDESCENS. 



Above black, the hair tipped with pale brown, in some positions appearing 

 greenish; beneath pale yellowish cinereous; tail longer tban the body, of the 

 same colors above and beneath, and tipped with black, not distichous. Head 

 small. Ears rounded and very short, not tufted. 



Length 6-7 in. ; tail 1-b in. ; head 1-5 in. ; ears "3. 



SciURUS LEMNISCATU8. 



Above on the head, upper part of the back and legs rufous brown, mixed 

 with darker and black. The back with four black stripes from the shoulders to 

 the hinder parts of the body and two stripes of yellowish, Avith one of rufous 

 (this last sometimes quite indistinct) down the middle of the back. Hair of the 

 head annulate with black, of the sides dark cinereous tipped with pale rufous. 

 Under side of the head, body and legs white. Head roundish : nose pointed ; 

 lower fore teeth slender; ears small round. Tail distichous. 



Varies in having the paler stripes scai'cely apparent. 



Length 7-5 in. ; tail G-5 in. 



SCIDRUS RUFOBRACeiATCS. 



Louis Eraser, Zoologia typica No. 24 ; Waterhouse, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1 842, p. 1 28. 



This animal is figured in Audubon and Bachman's Quadrupeds of North 

 America, under the name of Spermophilus annulatus. The specimen described 

 by Dr. Bachman was purchased in New York from a dealer in preserved birds. 

 It is by no means a native of our continent. 



SCIURUS PUMILIO. 



Hair short and soft, dark cinereous, tipped with reddish brown, on the throat 

 and belly with much paler. Head short roundish ; ears small ; tail shorter than 

 the body, distichous ; hair reddish brown at base and tip, black in the middle, 

 appearing by this disposition of colors to be edged with brown ; four of the toes 

 on each foot equal. 



Length 5-4 ; head -I . ear -2 ; tail 2-3 ; fore leg -9 ; hind leg 1-5. 



ALUMINIUM. 



The progress in its manufacture. 



BY W. J. TAYLOR. 



The use of sodium in the reduction of metals from their chlorides, as has been 

 so successfully accomplished within the last two years, may be justly considered 

 a great progressive step in science. 



Aluminium has been the first in which this process has been perfected. What 

 the other metals are which will be reduced successfully from their chlorides by 

 the use of sodium, the future will determine. Some facts concerning the early 

 history of aluminium, the progress made in its manufacture, and the numerous 

 uses to which it can be applied, will not be uninteresting. 



Much confusion existed in the minds of the early alchymists regarding the 

 oxide alumina. They knew of an alum which was brought from the East, which 

 they regarded for a long time as sulphuric acid combined with an earth. Stahl 

 and others also mistook this earth for lime. Geoffroy, in 1728, pointed out its 

 existence in clay; Marggraff, in 1754, proved it to be a substance having a sepa- 



1857.]

rate existence and peculiar characters. To Oerstedt belongs the credit of first 

 preparing the chloride of aluminium, from which compound W5hler, in 1827, 

 succeeded in first eliminating the metal. Wohler first obtained aluminium in 

 the form of a grey powder, by heating gradually in a porcelain crucible over a 

 spirit lamp equal volumes of metallic potassium and chloride of aluminium ; 

 other chemists, by slight modifications of this process, have obtained aluminium 

 in the form of the grey powder, as first obtained by Wohler. 



To M. Sainte Claire Deville belongs the credit for first improving the process, 

 so as to produce aluminium in such quantities that its characters as a metal 

 could be fully investigated. M. Ste. Claire Deville used in his process sodium 

 as a substitute for potassium. (It requires 39 parts of potassium to produce the 

 same reductive effect as 23 parts of sodium.) At the time of his first experi- 

 ments sodium was worth one hundred dollars per pound ; he so improved the 

 process for making this metal as to reduce the price to ninety cents per pound. 



At this time the chloride of aluminium was regarded witli sodium as a curi- 

 osity of the laboratory ; it was then produced in small quantities by heating 

 alumina mixed with coal, in a porcelain tube, and passing over it a current of 

 dry chlorine gas. 



M. Ste. Claire Deville made farther improvements in this process, so as to 

 make it in an apparatus as large as a gas retort and in quantities proportional, 

 at a price of twenty-five cents per pound. To produce the reaction of sodium 

 with the chloride of aluminium was the most difficult point of the entire process. 

 M. Ste. Claire Deville used for the reduction the distillation of the chloride of 

 aluminium over the sodium, which was placed in trays of copper enclosed in a 

 tube. The temperature developed by the reaction is very great if the current 

 of the chloride of aluminium be rapid ; by this process it was found that it re- 

 quired at least ten pounds of sodium to produce one pound of aluminium, (part 

 of the aluminium produced being destroyed at its formation by the scorise,) 

 when by theory it required only two and a half pounds. This great loss of 

 sodium and the difficulties in conducting this reaction on a large scale, were 

 very great objections to the process. 



All the aluminium at the Paris Exhibition was made by this process, and it 

 was from a portion of this that M. Regnault made his investigations, and in 

 which he found copper and iron. The copper came from the trays in which 

 the reduction was made. The presence of these metals in small quantities will 

 account for the peculiar physical properties which he ascribed to aluminium. 



Circumstances having interrupted M. Ste. Claire Deville in the experiments 

 which he was making on a large scale, the subject rested for a while here. In 

 the meanwhile Heinrich Rose suggested and made experiments with cryolite, 

 (a fluoride of aluminium and sodium,) and gave his views that this mineral was 

 a valuable substance from which to produce aluminium. 



Wfthler made experiments also with cryolite, and arrived at conclusions 

 somewhat similar to Heinrich Rose. They both succeeded in producing 

 some of the metal, but the results were not entirely satisfactory. 



M. Ste. Claire Deville again resumed his experiments, but instead of distilling 

 the chloride of aluminium on the metallic sodium, as in his first experiments, 

 he fused in a crucible, in the manner pursued by Rose and Wohler, using, 

 however, with the double chloride of aluminium and sodium and the metallic 

 sodium, the fluoride of calcium, (fluor spar,) or some cryolite as a flux. This 

 experiment of M. Deville was very satisfactory, and the reduction in accordance 

 with the theory. 



While these experiments were in progress in Europe, similar ones were being 

 made in this country by Mr. Alfred Monnier, in Camden, N. J. ; to him credit is 

 due for having first made aluminium in the United States. Having had oppor- 

 tunities for examining his processes for making the double chloride of aluminium 

 and sodium, metallic sodium, and the modes of reduction, melting and refining the 

 aluminium, the conclusion is satisfactory that the discoveries of science have 

 been successfully applied to render the manufacture of this metal an industrial 

 art. 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 13 



Mr. Monnier in his experiments met with the same diCBculties in the reduction. 

 He found, however, by careful investigation and analysis, that the effect pro- 

 duced was also perfectly in accordance with the theory. When, after great dif- 

 ficulties, sufficient quantities of pure aluminium were obtained, and its proper- 

 ties as a metal carefully studied ; it was found that it was not in the least 

 degree oxidized by fusion with the nitrate of potash. This peculiar property 

 causes a strong contrast between it and any well known metal, and this won- 

 derful fact produced a new phase in the manufacture of aluminium. Owing to 

 this discovery, the efforts which had been made to produce aluminium from 

 perfectly pure material were found unnecessary. 



By using pure materials for its manufacture, it was necessary to employ ap- 

 paratus which was very costly, as it required that it should be free from any 

 injurious substances. 



By the facility with which aluminium can be refined, owing to its peculiar 

 properties to resist oxidation, it can be manufactured from impure and crude 

 materials, in apparatus which can be cheaply made of still cheaper material, and 

 without the great care and watchfulness necessary in the manipulations, where 

 pure materials are employed. 



Since July, 1855, Mr. Monnier has made the double chloride by mixing alumina 

 with salt (chloride of Sv/dium) and coal, and bypassing over this mass (ignited) 

 a current of dry chlorine gas, (kaolin or common clay can be used instead of the 

 alumina.) The double chloride runs out from the condenser in a stream, and 

 is collected in a receiver; it becomes solid when cold. 



The reaction is so complete that no chlorine is lost. It has already been 

 manufactured at a cost of eight cents per pound, but the operations were car- 

 ried on to a very limited extent. It is, however, clearly (to be) demonstrated that, 

 with works of sufficient size and a proportional economy in manufacture, the 

 double chloride of aluminium and sodium, can be produced at a cost not ex- 

 ceeding four and a half cents per pound. 



In the manufacture of sodium Mr. Monnier has made considerable improve- 

 ment; it has already been produced at a cost of twenty-five cents per pound. 



In the manufacture of zinc (by the Belgian process) one retort produces about 

 thirteen pounds of metal in 24 hours. In the manufacture of sodium the reduction 

 is so quick that 52 pounds of this metal can be produced in a retort of the same 

 size in the same space of time. 



The reduction of zinc costs from two to two and a quarter cents per pound. 

 The amount of ore necessary, being from a half to three-quarter cents per pound. 

 Giving for the cost of one pound of metal about three to three and a quarter 

 cents. 



The reduction of sodium costs about ... 4 cents per pound. 



The carbonate of soda, 2^ lbs. at 4 cents, . . 10 " •' 



Giving for total cost of one pound of sodium, . . 14 " 



Sodium can be manufactured on as large a scale as zinc, and when the work- 

 men have the same practical experience in the manipulations, the price of reduc- 

 tion will be still farther reduced, so that the difference between it and zinc will 

 be that of the first cost of carbonate of soda and the zinc ore. 



It has already been shown that the double chloride of aluminium and sodium 

 can be produced at a very low price ; metallic sodium can also be made very 

 cheaply ; the reduction is readily effected in accordance with the theory, but the 

 difficulty in uniting the metallic globules of aluminium when formed, is obviated 

 by stirring at this point with a rod, and the destruction of the metal by the 

 alkaline scoria is prevented by adding to the charge of the double chloride of 

 aluminium and sodium, chloride of sodium and metallic sodium, either fluoride 

 of calcium, (fluor spar,) or cryolite. 



By these means the greater portion of the metal is united in one mass, the 

 other portion of the metal in small globules remain with the slag, which can be 

 removed mechanically, or by first digesting in water ; there will however remain 



1857.]

about ten per cent, with the slag. This will be explained by the following data. 

 Theoretically: 



• 250 parts of metallic Sodium produce 



100 " " Aluminium; 



VO parts are obtained in one metallic mass ; 

 20 " " in metallic globules ; 



90 " being the nett produce. 

 10 " remain with the scoria. 



Total, 100 



The alkaline scoria contains large quantities of the chloride of sodium, that 

 can be easily extracted by water, leaving an insoluble residue from which the 

 fluoride of aluminium can be extracted by volatilization. The scoria containing 

 the fluoride and the metallic aluminium is economically used by introducing it 

 again with a new charge of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, and 

 metallic sodium, and by that means the loss of the metal is rendered very small. 



Aluminium, when carefully removed from any slag, is readily fused in a 

 crucible by itself; when in fusion (which is at a lower point than that required 

 to fuse silver) the whole is stirred with a rod, and all the globules of metal are 

 united in one mass with the greatest facility ; at this point nitrate of potash ca,n 

 be added, (the stirring continued.) 



All other metals are oxidized by this process ; the refining is finished when 

 the metal has a pure white color. It can now be poured into a mould of smy 

 shape. 



Impure aluminium may be whitened by plunging it into caustic potash or 

 soda, washing it quickly with distilled water, plunging it again into pure nitric 

 acid, again washing quickly and thoroughly. The surface then has the fine 

 white color of pure aluminium, which it retains unless afterwards polished. 

 This operation has for its object to dissolve out the metals which darken the 

 color of aluminium by their presence. 



Aluminium forms alloys with nearly all the metals, but those which it forms 

 with silver and copper are the most interesting. 



Five parts of aluminium with one hundred parts of pure silver produce 

 an alloy almost as hard as a silver coin, which contains about one-tenth of 

 copper, so that sufficient hardness can be given to silver, without introducing 

 into it a poisonous or an alterable metal. It has the advantage of being worked 

 like silver in a pure state, possessing, however, greater hardness, and being 

 capable of a higher polish. 



Ten parts of aluminium and ninety parts of copper produce an alloy of a pale 

 gold color, possessing great hardness and considerable malleability ; its hard- 

 ness is greater than that of bronze, in the proportion of fifty-one to forty-nine. 

 It can be worked when warm, with the same facility as the best soft iron. 



Twenty parts of aluminium and eighty of copper give to the alloy the color 

 and brilliancy of fine gold, and at the same time sufficient hardness to scratch 

 the alloy of gold employed in coin, without imparing in the slightest degree its 

 malleability. 



By an increase of the per centage of copper in alloys of aluminium the alloy 

 is rendered brittle, showing that the metal must be either used pure or alloyed 

 in small quantities with the copper. 



This explains the peculiar properties ascribed to it by M. Regnault in his in- 

 vestigations on the physical properties of the aluminium prepared by M. Deville, 

 exhibited at the Paris exhibition. 



Numerous experiments have been made (without regard to economy of manu- 

 facture) to obtain the aluminium directly from the oxide alumina, or from the 

 fluoride of aluminium. 



But the results obtained by the use of this double chloride of aluminium and 



[Jan.

sodium, have fully demonstrated that it is the most economical mode by which 



to produce this metal. Theoretically it requires — 



3-86 Chlorine, at 6 cents per pound, . . . -23 16-100 



1-86 Alumina, at 3 " " 05 58-100 



5-68 Carbonate of Soda, at 4 cents per pound, . -22 72-100 



Total, -51 46-100 



Making for the materials for manufacturing one pound of aluminium, estimated 

 at the market prices, 51^ cents. Practically it requires — 



16 lbs. of the double chloride of aluminium and sodium, at 8 cts. per lb., $1 28 

 2| lbs. metallic sodium, at about 25 cents per lb., .... 70 



Flux aud cost of reduction, 2 02 



Total, $4 00 



By manufacturing on a larger scale, and by using the slag as a flux instead of 

 employing fresh material, the lowest cost will be reduced to the following : 

 10 lbs. of double chloride of aluminium and sodium, at 4J cents per lb., $0 45 

 2\ lbs. of sodium, at 14 cents per lb., ....... 35 



Cost of reduction, 20 



Total, $1 00 



It is seen that the actual cost of one pound of aluminium, when manufactured 

 extensively, will be about double the theoretical cost as before estimated, (fifty- 

 one cents.) 



For the production of aluminium are used clay, salt, sulphur, manganese, 

 lime and fluor spar, materials which are very abundant and cheap ; all that is 

 now required is practical experience, to reduce the price of the metal still nearer 

 to the price of the raw materials, as has been before stated. The history of the 

 useful arts coutains numerous instances that, where skill and perfection of ap- 

 paratus are required, difficulties are speedily overcome. 



The density of aluminium when moulded is 2-56. The density of aluminium 

 when rolled is 2-67. In equal weight with silver it is four times more volumi- 

 nous. In equal weights with copper, bronze, brass and German silver, it pos- 

 sesses from three to three and a half times greater volume. In equal volumes 

 with the above metals and alloys it possesses greater rigidity. 



Mention has already been made of a very important property of aluminium 

 when pure ; that is to resist oxidation, a property which it possesses to a greater 

 degree than the other metals. 



Aluminium is not acted upon by nitric acid, hydrosulphuric acid, or by the or- 

 ganic acids ; slightly by sulphuric acid. It is but little affected by fusion with 

 sulphur ; mustard is found to act upon it slightly. Its true solvent is hydro- 

 chloric acid. 



When we compare it in these respects with those metals, which are acted 

 upon by most of these acids giving salts, which are more or less poisonous, the 

 comparison is favorable to aluminium, as its salts, if formed, are innocuous. 



According to M. C. Tissier, aluminium is not changed by a solution of nitrate 

 or sulphate of copper, but it is dissolved by a solution of chloride of copper with 

 the separation of metallic copper. It is attacked, however, by a solution of ni- 

 trate or sulphate of copper when it contains chloride of sodium, and this proves 

 that chloride of copper is formed by the presence of the chloride of sodium. 

 Aluminium is not attacked by an aqueous solution of alum, or by one of chlo- 

 ride of sodium, but a mixture of the two dissolves it with an evolution of hydro- 

 gen, aud this proves that chloride of aluminium is contained in the mixture. 



Wheatstone long since showed that aluminium was as strongly electro-nega- 

 tive as platinum. Its sonorous qualities are very great, like tlaat of crystal. 

 Various are the uses which can be made of the aluminium and of its alloys with 

 silver and copper. All the purposes for which it could be advantageously em- 

 ployed in virtue of its peculiar properties, of not tarnishing by exposure to at- 

 mospheric agencies, aud its lightness combined with its extraordinary strength, 



1857.]

would be far too tedious to enumerate. A few instances only will suffice of its 

 adaptability for philosophical apparatus, for all articles for table, for service 

 and ornament, for kitchen utensils, for the works of clocks and even watches, 

 for trappings of harness, for plate and door knobs, keys, &c. Its sonorous quali- 

 ties render it valuable for making bells. In the galvano-plastic arts it replaces 

 platinum. 



Aluminium is most easily soldered with its own alloys. The alloys most con- 

 venient are those with silver, zinc or tin, their point of fusion being below that 

 of aluminium. The soldering may be done by means of a spirit lamp, and with- 

 out any previous cleaning. 



Pure aluminium can be easily distinguished from impure by its greater white- 

 ness, its indistinct traces of crystallization ; occasionally one or two well- 

 defined hexagons can be recognized on the surface of the ingots. The impure 

 has a bluish tint like zinc, and if the entire surface is not crystalline, the upper 

 surface is always more so than in pure aluminium; the form of the crystals is 

 also quite different. 



In giving the theoretical proportion of material employed in the manufacture 

 of aluminium, the relative cheapness of its production, its properties and strength 

 when comparing it bulk for bulk with other metals, it is desired to demonstrate 

 its valuable properties and uses, also to guard against the fictitious reports so 

 current of its excessive cheapness. 



Note. — The experiment of Sir H. Davy should be mentioned in the early pro- 

 duction of this metal ; he endeavored to produce it by passing the vapor of po- 

 tassium over alumina at a white heat ; he obtained only small grey particles 

 interspersed with aluminate of potash.

A letter was read from Rev. E. J. Lowe, dated Observatory, Beeston, 

 near Nottingham, (England,) Jan. 7th, 1857, containing the following 

 passage : — 



"The late Mr. Lawson, F. R. S., left rae his valuable collection of Meteoro- 

 logical Instruments, amongst which are Dr. Benjamin Franklin's Hygrometer, 

 which is in as good working order as on the day it was made, an Electric Kite 

 belonging to Dr. Franklin, and several letters. Mr. Lawson had a card placed 

 on the hygrometer, with the following inscription, ' Invented by and belonged 

 to Dr. Benjamin Franklin, the Patriot of Philadelphia.' I have mentioned this, 

 thinking that you would feel an interest as American Philosophers in the 

 information respecting the instruments of that glorious philosopher Dr. Frank- 

 lin."

Which were severally referred to Committees. 



Mr. Lea made the following remarks on the visual organs of certain 

 species of the genus Unio : 



He 'stated that he had at various times paid a good deal of attention to 

 the habits and organs of the Naiades of our own country, and for that purpose 

 frequently had them for long periods in a living state under his observation. 

 Their condition as to special sense has been of great interest, and particularly 

 those of touch, hearing and sight. In the course of these investigations, it be- 

 came evident to him that some species of Unio were sensitive to light, and he 

 found one species ( Unio radiatus) very eminently so. He stated that he was not 

 aware of its ever having been suggested that any of the family were possessed 

 of organs of sight, even in a young state, as in the case of the young of Mytilus 

 edulis. It is well known that some of the Molluscs have large and perfect eyes, 

 while some others have imperfect ones, but generally they are altogether devoid 

 of the optic nerve. The Sirombidce are said to possess an eye highly organised, 

 but in most of the Gasteropoda it is of a more simple structure, and perhaps only 

 possesses sensibility of light without the power of distinct vision. The terres- 

 trial Gasteropoda have usually a distinct eyeball on the extremity of the superior 

 tentacula, which Dr. Leidy has shown, in some of our species of Helices, to 

 possess a crystalline lens and choroidea, with clear, consistent, vitreous humor. 

 Cuvier and Lamarck considered the whole class of Conchifera to be devoid of 

 eyes, but Poll has shown that in Fecten varius, Lin., the margin of the mantle is 

 furnished with numerous eyes. These, according to Carpenter, are protected 

 by a sclerotic coat with a transparent cornea in front, a layer of pigment, a 

 crystalline lens and vitreous body, and a retinal expansion proceeding from an 

 optic nerve. In the course of his observations, Mr. Lea became satisfied that 

 the closing of the siphonal tubes, on his approach to the specimens he had in 

 his vivarium, was not altogether occasioned by the vibration caused by his ap- 

 proach, and he accordingly arranged numerous individuals of several species 

 with a view carefully to observe them. In the course of these e.xaminations 

 repeatedly made, he found several species of Unio quite sensitive to his passing 

 his hand between them and the light, while the Margaritana margarttifera, and 



1857.] 2 




18 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



Anodonta undulata and A. lacustris, Lea, showed no signs of sensitiveness. Unio 

 ■inflalus exhibited but little motion, while numerous specimens of U. radiatus in- 

 variably gave more or less sign when the interruption of light took place. Some 

 individuals were more sensitive than others, and the females exhibited this 

 power much more than the males, often withdrawing, not only their siphons, 

 but their mantle within the valves. 



It is difficult to say with certainty how far their visual organs are developed, 

 as well also as to number and exact position. The fringes of the branchial and 

 and anal siphons are, in the Uniones, formed of small, subconical tentacula. 

 These are larger in the branchial siphon of Unio, while they do not exist at all 

 in the anal opening of Anodonta;. With a good lens the terminal point of the 

 tentacula may be observed to be rounded and furnished with at least the ap- 

 pearance of an eye, and that it will prove to be a true eye, however imperfect, 

 there can be but little doubt. Mr. Lea did not intend to pursue the minute ana- 

 tomy of this organ ; he left it to Dr. Leidy, who had done so much in the histo- 

 logy of the terrestrial Gasteropods, believing that he would be able to make out 

 the complete anatomy of the eye in the U7iio.

 Anodonta fiuviatilis and Anodonta lacustris, within the cleft of the upper bran- 

 chial cavity, adhering to the outer surface of the renal organ and the con- 

 tiguous margin of the foot. The new parasite, for which the name of Cotylaspis 

 insignis was proposed, is from ^ aline to 1 line long, curved funnel shaped, with 

 the base forming an oval ventral disk provided with an outer circle and an inner 

 row of acetabula 29 in number. The animal is provided with distinct eyes, 

 while Aspidogaster, in accordance with its being imprisoned in the pericardium 

 of the Naiades, is blind.

Catalogue of Birds collected on the Eiver Muni, Western Africa, by Mr. P. B Db- 



Chaillu in 1856, with notes and descriptions of new species. 



BY JOHN CASSIN. 



The collection of birds, of which the succeeding is a catalogue, was made by 

 Mr. DuChaillu during a journey up the River Aluni, made with the hope of 

 being able to reach the supposed source of the River Congo as laid down in 

 recent maps. In this, however, he did not succeed, being prevented by ranges 

 of high mountains, and the fact that the nations of negroes at the extreme point 

 attained by him were unwilling to allow any of their people to accompany him, 

 and apparently knew nothing of the nations beyond those mountains. He 

 penetrated to a distance of 250 to 300 miles from the coast, and traced the Muni 

 to its source. ' 



As at Cape Lopez, Mr. DuChaillu did not collect birds of which numerous 

 specimens had formerly been sent in his collections from the Gaboon and from 

 the Moondah. This fact will account for the absence of some well known species 

 from the present catalogue. 



Mr. DuChaillu is at present about to undertake the ascent of the River Camma, 

 lat. about 1.30 S., again hoping to reach the Congo, and if successful will attempt 

 its ascent to its source. With this journey he will occupy the present year, and 

 is amply provided with the necessary equipment for his arduous and perilous 

 undertaking, through the liberality of gentlemen of this Academy.

head. Under parts yellow, clear and deeper on the throat ; breast and middle 

 of the abdomen tinged with greenish on the sides and flanks ; under tail corerts 

 pale yellow ; exposed end= of secondary quills chestnut brown ; primaries edged 

 with greenish yellow on their outer webs. Bill dark, both mandibles tipped 

 and with their cutting edges white ; legs light bluish. 



Sexes very nearly alike, females slightly smaller. 



Hah. River Muni, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu. 



This is a small straight billed species belonging to the same group as our 

 T. noiaiiis and T. canicapillus, Hartlaub. It may be easily distinguished by its 

 straight bill and chestnut colored tail, both of which characters strongly mark 

 all of the specimens now before me, through some are evidently not in adult 

 plumage. 



The present bird appears to be allied also to T. olivaeens, Swainson, and to 

 T. icterinus, Temm. Bonap. Cons. Av. p. 262. It is, however, but a distant rela- 

 tive of T. barbaius, Temm. PL Col. 88, not belonging to the same subgeneric 

 group, and the description of T. icterinus, consisting as it does simply of a state- 

 ment : " Similis Tr. barbato, sed diiplo minor," is too careless and indefinite to be 

 entitled to any consideration. 



Six specimens have been received from Mr. DuChaillu, five of which are in 

 the present collection and one in that from the River Moonda, formerly received.

Very fine adult specimens, with the yellow stripe on each side of the throat 

 strongly marked. Sexes alike. I am not quite sure that Mr. Fraser's plate as 

 above represents this species. 



10. Andropadus virens, nobis. 



Smaller than either A. gracilirostris, latirostris or imporiimvs, but most resem- 

 bling the last. Bill wide at base, rather short, cutting edge of the upper man- 

 dible distinctly crenated near tbe tip ; wing moderate, rounded, fourth and fifth 

 quills longest and nearly equal ; tail rather short, with the feathers wide, plu- 

 mage of the rump long, ample, soft ; feet moderate. 



Total length, about 6 inches, wing 3, tail 2| inches. 



Colors generally resembling those of ^. i7}iportunus, but with the tail in the 

 present species dark greenish brown. Entire plumage above dark olive green, 

 rather lighter on the rump ; upper tail coverts tinged with brown. Under parts 

 yellowish green, the yellow predominating on the middle of the abdomen and 

 under tail coverts. Inferior coverts of the wing light greenish yellow ; quills 

 edged on their inner webs with yellowish white. Tail greenish brown with the 

 feathers slightly edged with yellowish green. Bill dark ; legs light colored. 



Hab. Cape Lopez and River Muni, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. 

 DuChaillu. 



This is a smaller species than any hitherto known of this genus. It resembles 

 in general appearance .4. importunus, but can at once be distinguished by its 

 smaller size and the more decided brown color of its tail, in which character it 

 is more like the other two species mentioned above. This bird and A. graci- 

 lirostris and latirostris are evidently abundant species of Equatorial Western 

 Africa, numerous specimens of each being in the collections of Mr. DuChaillu.

Several specimens of this little species are in the present collection, all of 



vrhich are but very slightly different from our specimens as above described. 



Some specimens have, however, the under mandible entirely yellowish white, and 



the color of the tarsi and toes is much lighter, being in fact pale yellowish. The 



present specimens are more recent than the former. 



16. Bdtalis comitatus, nobis. 



Intimately allied to, and resembling the preceding, but much larger, with the 

 under mandible entirely dark colored and all the plumage darker. 



Bill wide at base with very strong bristles ; wing rather long, fourth quill 

 longest ; tail moderate, with the feathers rather pointed. 



Total length about 5 inches, wing 2i, tail 2^ inches. 



Eftire upper parts dark cinereous, lighteron the rump, a narrow line of black 

 aroiiad the neck behind. Quills and tail brownish black. Throat and middle 

 of the abdomen white, breast and flanks dark cinereous. Inferior wing coverts 

 ashy white, inner edges of quills white. Bill dark. 



Hab. Muni river, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChailiu. 



Much resembling H. ejmlalus, but larger and easily distinguished. One speci-

Pycnosphrys McCallii, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada., vii. p. 326, (1855.) 

 Presenting no characters diflering from those given in the original description. 

 A second specimen of this curious little bird is in the present collection. It does 

 not belong to the genus Pycnosphrys^ a specimen of the type of which is now in 

 the Museum of the Academy. The present bird has a strong and rather wide 

 bill, numerous long bristles and a rather long tail. In form only (not in color) 

 it resembles the genus Tyrannula. My leisure at present will not warrant an ex- 

 tended examination. 



18. Drymoica Bairdii, Cassin. 



Drymoica Bairdii, Cassin, Proc. Acad. Philada., vii. p. 327, (1855.)

 the under parts from the base of the under mandible to the inferior tail coverts 

 including the iihice.

The adult of this species is very easily recognized, but the young is different. 

 In some specimens there is no appearance of the crest, and the entire head and 

 neck is of a dull brick red ; the other plumage dull browish black. In one speci- 

 men, evidently youug, the head above is of the same dull brownish black with 

 a few red feathers intermixed.

 as above was scarcely as mature as several that are in the present collection. 



27. Sycobius RACHELiin;, nobis. 



Rather smaller than S. scutatus. General form short and rather heavy ; bill 

 stout ; wing moderate, third quill longest ; tail rather short. Total length about 

 52 inches, wing 3^, tail 2 inches. 



Head above bright reddish orange, a paler shade of which extends on to the 

 sides of the neck. Throat and cheeks black, which color includes the eyes. 

 Neck before and breast bright orange red, immediately fading into bright yellow 

 and extending on the sides further than on the middle of the breast. Entire upper 

 parts, wings and tail and abdomen deep black, which color on the abdomen 

 runs into a point on the middle of the lower part of the breast. Under tail 

 coverts yellow. Under wing coverts black. Bill and feet dark. 



Hab. River Muni, Western Africa. Discovered by Mr. P. B. DuChaillu. 



This is a beautiful and quite peculiar species in its colors and general appear- 

 ance. It is the only one in which the colors of the breast extend on the sides, 

 as may be seen in some species of Euplcctes (for instance in E. melanogaster (Lath.) 

 Vieill. Ois. Chant, pi. 27). On the neck and breast the rich orange red is most 

 distinct immediately next to and below the black of the throat, and rather sud- 

 denly fades into bright and clear yellow on the sides of the breast. Two speci- 

 mens are in the collection. 



Not wishing nor ever intending to pursue science as a cold abstraction, nor 

 as an object of selfish ambition, I have named many birds in commemoration of 

 my friends, and hope to do so again. For this I have the example of the great- 

 est zoologists, and of none more conclusively than that of the greatfounder of mod- 

 era systematic Zoology, who applied this description ofnames, especially to genera 

 of plants, more extensively than any other naturalist has done in any depart- 

 ment of Natural History. 



By this token, I name the present beautiful bird after my loved and only 

 daughter. Should her pathway in the world be pleasant, may she know also the 

 great gratification that comes from the pursuit of Natural History ; but if like 

 her namesake of ancient days she shall go on her way weeping, may she have

The present collection contains the second specimen that I have ever seen of 

 this remarkable species. This specimen is apparently not in so mature plumage 

 as that originally described by me, and has the feathers on the clieeks behind 

 and below the eye mixed with white and black, instead of pure white as in the 

 former specimen. The greater wing coverts and all the quills are tipped with 

 white.

 strictly of the same form, does not resemble it in colors. 



As a slight testimony to his accomplishments as a naturalist and enterprize

On the Crania of the Ancient Britons, with Semarks on the People themselves. 

 BY JOSEPH BARNARD DAVIS. 



It was the distinguished and excellent Professor Samuel George Morton, who, 

 by his industry, skill and great attainments, mainly developed what may be de- 

 nominated the science of Comparative Cranioscopy, as applied to ancient and 

 extinct races of men. And we deem it an especial honor to be permitted to 

 address that learned body before which Morton's chief discoveries in this science 

 were first announced — an Academy which had the surpassing advantage of 

 numbering him among its Presidents. But in venturing thus to address the 

 Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia upon a subject congenial to those 

 so admirably illustrated by its late President, and therefore in some measure 

 following in his steps, it must be distinctlj'' announced in limine^ that it is not 

 with any pretensions whatever to co-equal powers, or co-equal learning. 



The Ancient Britons, the aboriginal people of the British Isles, are a race of 

 whose physical characters we can learn little or nothing from classical writers, 

 whether Greek or Roman. The very little knowledge to be acquired is only 

 incidental, never direct — imparted as it were by accident. They were a people 

 divided into a number of tribes, living chiefly by the chase and the products of 

 the rivers and the sea ; yet not devoid of both pastoral and agricultural habits. 

 They are known to us mainly from presenting a serious obstacle for ages to the 

 arms of the conquerors of the world — imperfectly subdued with much difficulty, 

 and only held in subjection by the most consummate stratagems of the military 

 art of the Romans. To account for their first appearance in the Islands, many 

 ingenious and learned theories of immigration have been broached, all of which 

 are exposed to a serious objection, independent of failing to suggest any reason- 

 able motive for such primordial migration, viz : that they are based upon a 

 point, instead of a broad and solid foundation — they invert the order of nature, 

 and make use of the result and the superstructure to give the substratum which 

 is required. They all suppose man, in his most primitive and most helpless 

 condition, to have been endowed and furnished with apjiliances and arts, which 

 are only the result of development and cultivation. And, like the similar fan- 

 ciful speculations which would derive the Indian tribes of the American continent 

 from the eastern one, are obnoxious to the objection of being gratuitous and 

 superfluous. Their inventors can give no valid reason, based on solid ethno- 

 logical ground, why the assumed migrations may not have pursued a diametri- 

 cally opposite course. This being the case, we have a right to maintain, that 

 there is a decided preponderance on either one side or the other, and an equal 

 reason to assume for the primitive inhabitants of the British Islands an aboriginal 

 and primordial character not inferior to that of any other race. 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 41 



Like most, if not all the primitive people, they have manifested the great 

 principle inherent in the human mind, which incessantly animates an irrei)ressibly 

 longing hope and aspiration for a future life — one of those elements of man, 

 which more than any other bears irresistible evidence, both of his inherent 

 grandeur and superiority in the animal scale, and also, of the strict unity and 

 identity of his race — they have manifested this noble and sacred sentiment by a 

 scrupulous and elaborate care in preserving the dead ; to whom they even fur- 

 nished food, objects of adornment, weapons and companions also for the future 

 life they anticipated beyond the tomb. Their tombs, the Cromlechs, Barrows, 

 Cairns of the British Islands, notwithstanding the lapse of twenty, thirty or 

 more centuries, have remained until recent times scattered over the surface of 

 the country in various directions; and, it is evident, have been constructed with 

 such pains and skill as to have braved all the chances and changes of revolving 

 ages, until the arts of modern agriculture, or the inquisitive hand of man — alas ! 

 almost constantly a rude, uninstructc^d and ruthless hand — have unhearsed the 

 remains they have so faithfully preserved. 



These remains, which, as Sir Thomas Browne long since said, " have quietly 

 rested under the drums and tramplings of three conquests," are capable of 

 teaching us something of the race to which they have belonged, andof recnlling 

 some of those physical features of which it is so unfortunate the ancients left 

 no full, faithful and permanent record, when they had the living people before 

 them. If we might not have expected from the martial spirit of Caesar an eth- 

 nography of the tribes who proved such stubborn obstacles to his ambition and 

 desire of conquest, there were those among his friends, who passed over 

 and remained with him in Britain, who had both the abilities and the op- 

 portunities to accomplish this task. The most illustrious of Roman orators, as 

 we learn from his invaluable Epistles, writing to his brother Quintus, who was 

 one of Ca.'sars companions in Britain, and even entertained the design, urges 

 upon him the composition of the work which we must ever lament the want of

 history of the war in which the great Roman general had been engaged with 

 them. It were in vain to lament the want of the curious information this work 

 would have imparted. We are now mainly reduced to the teachings of the

The eleven fine lithographs of the skulls of the ancient Britons, which I trans- 

 mit to the Academy with this paper, have been executed from the crania them- 

 selves of the natural size, and with the greatest care and fidelity. They are 

 derived from Barrows in parts of England at considerable distances from each 

 other, — some from Yorkshire, which was inhabited by the tribe of the Brigantes 

 in the time of Ptolemy, about the year 120 of the Christian era, — some from Der- 

 byshire and Staflbrdsbire, the seats of the Coritani and Cornavii at the same 

 period, — one from Gloucestershire, the seat of the Dobuni, — and others from 

 Wiltshire, the country of the Atrebaiii in the days of Ptolemy. We cannot af- 

 firm that they have actually belonged to individuals of these tribes respectively, 

 as there are many chances which might render this doubtful. Wars, whether 

 intestine or foreign, and migrations, no doubt did their work of mutation in that 

 early time as they have done since ; and there is also the possibility, although 

 very remote, of their having belonged to prisoners, or to guests of neighboring 

 or remote tribes. But in the absence of all evidence to support these supposi- 

 tions, we cannot err much in appropriating them to the tribes in whose country 

 they were found. At least, there can be no question of their genuine Britannia 

 origin and derivation. This, as we shall perceive on closer examination is im- 

 pressed on every feature, and is now almost as cognizable as in the day in which 

 they were clothed with their fleshly lineaments. 



The study of skulls in general teaches us that among all races, although there 

 is a general resemblance running through the series belonging to a given race, 



1857.] 




42 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



yet there are many minor diversities ; and it is probable that among European 

 races these diversities have a wider range than in the other great divisions of 

 the human family. Morton was able to discern among all the numerous Ameri- 

 can races, exclusive of his hyperborean, a family resemblance. Notwithstand- 

 ing this position of his, we must admit that the diversities of the cranial forms 

 of the very numerous and diverse tribes of the American continent are both 

 great and frequent; and an extended study would in all probability develope 

 such resemblances in specific families as would confer upon them a distinct 

 and proper value. Now among such specific families belonging to European 

 races we believe it is much the same, only that the individual peculiarities in 

 the families diverge further from the tribal type of form, and are probably 

 more frequent. Under these circumstances, we are prepared to expect diver- 

 sity of form among the crania of the ancient IBritons ; but it is not unreasonable 

 also to expect that, true to the beautiful principle of nature, of an endless diversity 

 under a comprehensive uniformity, this diversity will be restrained within limits, 

 and be subjected to definite rules. We may therefore endeavor to distinguish 

 what may be denominated the typical form of cranium belonging to any race of 

 man, and then to arrange the divergent forms subordinately around this. 



I. We believe the iijpical form of cranium of the ancient Briton may be re- 

 garded as represented by some of the skulls delineated in these lithographs, 

 especially in that from the Barrow on Ballidon Moor in Derbyshire, and that 

 from Green Gate Hill Barrow in Yorkshire, and that from Codford iu Wilt- 

 shire, plates 1, 3, 4 of the 1st decade of Crania Britannica. They are somewhat 

 short or brac/u/-ccphalic, not ill-developed, nor remarkable for a small facial angle. 

 The bones of the face, and especially the upper maxillaries, are upright, or orthog- 

 nathous, but, also rather short ; and they present, more than the bones of the 

 calvariunl that rugged aspect which is the characteristic of a savage or semi-civil- 

 ized race. The chin is usually prominent, the external surface of the upper max- 

 illaries depressed, the nose abrupt and short, surmounted with a frowning 

 eminence marking the situation of the frontal sinuses. The teeth are tolerably 

 large and usually well worn. They correspond with the rugged and frequently 

 everted angle of the lower jaw, the spacious zygomatic arch, and the large 

 surface, well marked out by its superior semi-circular line on the sides of the 

 calvarium. These rough and spacious surfaces indicate power in the temporal 

 and masseter muscles, and equally with the condition of the teeth, reveal a 

 people of carnivorous tastes, a peojile whose delight was in the chase, and the 

 luscious feasts it afforded them. 



II. Of the aberrant forms of the ancient British skull one is remarkable for its 

 length, and may be denominated doUcho-cephalic. To this form there attaches 

 a good deal of interest, from the theories which learned men have been in- 

 duced to associate with it. An example of this peculiar aberration is afforded 

 by the cranium from the famous chambered Barrow of Uleybury in Gloucester- 

 shire, plate 5 of Cran. Brit. This skull is remarkable for its length and want 

 of elevation, but it is not particularly distinguished by narrowness. Other ex- 

 amples of the dolicho-cephalic form of the ancient British cranium are known 

 to the writer, but some of these are quite as much marked by their want of 

 breadth as by their elongation. In fact, they equal in this feature the skulls of 

 that race to which longness and narrowness of cranium are regarded as pe- 

 culiarly appropriated — the negroes of Africa. It is a singular circumstance 

 that these long skulls of ancient Britons have usually been met with in a 

 particular species of Barrow, that which is composed of a series of chambers, 

 arranged it may be in diverse manners — the chambered Barrow. In the anxious 

 inquiries in which the mind is apt to indulge when prying into the almost im- 

 penetrable obscurity of a very remote past, every special circumstance fixes 

 the attention and acquires importance. And the discoveries we have men- 

 tioned have led to the theory that these long crania have belonged to a par- 

 ticular precedent race of people, a people who interred their dead in a more 

 elaborate and complex manner than the race which succeeded them ; a race of 

 people which have been distinguished by the denomination oipre-Celtic. In the

opinion of the writer the evidence is much too incomplete for any such inference 

 as this, were it not equally obnoxious to the objection mentioned in the early 

 part of our rcniurks — that of a certain inversion in the order of sequence — by 

 representing the complex barrow builders as jjreceding those who raised simple 

 barrows, which is contrary to all experience. There arc good archaeological rea- 

 sons, it is true, for believing that the chambered Barrows of Great Britain be- 

 long to what is denominated " the stone period," and that they are very early, 

 but that the builders of them can with any good confidence be referred to the 

 earliest portion of the stone period, seems to us to want [jrobability as much as 

 it wants conclusive evidence for its suj)port. The circumstance that these long 

 skulls have usually been found in chambered Barrows may be a mere contin- 

 gency, little more than accidental, and further inquiry may not improbably 

 prove this. For it must not be supposed that the skulls of ancient Britons are 

 numerous, or have often been saved from the wreck of their primeval sepul- 

 chres, and especially that many of the dolicho-cephalic crania from Barrows 

 of a chambered character have been met with. Strangers to the facts of the 

 case might have supposed both these things to be true, but indeed they are far 

 from being so. Specimens of crania of ancient Britons are rare objects, those 

 in anything like a perfect state, very rare, and all specimens are becoming rarer 

 every day. British Barrows have been undergoing destructiou for ages, having 

 been the prey of idle curiosity or cupidity always, and the skulls of those once 

 so sacredly enhearsed in them by the tender hands of mourning friends and re- 

 lations have always been especially exposed to destruction, possibly from the 

 feeling of ignorant terror, which is so apt to diverge into ferocity and destriic- 

 tiveness. But whatever be the cause, the fact receives daily confirmation that 

 when ancient tombs are accidently opened by uninstructed and unscientific per- 

 sons, the relics are plundered and the fragile bony remains are at once violent- 

 ly broken into fragments. Therefore objects such as those with which our at- 

 tention is occupied are not numerous, and have not received that notice to 

 which they are entitled. But to return to the dolicho-cephalic crania of the 

 chambered Barrows, supposed to indicate a " pre-Celtic race," and upon which 

 has chiefly been built the mighty doctrine — certainly mighty for such a meagre 

 foundation — that an entire race of a distinct peo])le, in some verj'^ remote period 

 of antiquity, migrated to the shores of the British islands and invaded them, 

 established themselves therein and dwelt there for ages. In some cases the 

 evidence for this vast hypothesis — countenanced by ethnologists of the greatest 

 learning, men well meriting the high reputation they enjoy — maj' be explained 

 in a much simpler way. In a Derbyshire Barrow, called Long Lowe, three 

 crania of this type occurred, which we are strongly inclined to regard as having 

 a family relation, and as exhibiting a mere family peculiarity. One a long flat 

 skull of beautiful outline, is that of a man, aged about 40 years ; another, that 

 of a woman somewhat older ; and the third, of a girl under 10 years of age, who 

 may be concluded to have been the daughter of the two above named p;vrents. 

 Another of the Derbyshire chambered Barrows, which has been ])roductive of 

 dolicho-cephalic crania, is situated u[)on " Five Wells Hill," and is unquestion- 

 ably of vast antiquity ; but we possess a skull from among the lowest interments 

 in this Barrow, which is of brachy-cephalic form, and the existence of which, 

 in the position in which it was found, we cannot help thinking shakes the 

 theory of the dolicho-cephalic pre-Celtic race to its very foundations. In fine, 

 we may remark, that we see no sufficient ground for admitting a favorite hypo- 

 thesisofthepresent day, that another race of people preceded the ancient Britons ; 

 which kind of doctrine has not been confined to the British isles, but took its 

 rise in Denmark and Norway, where it has received its chief attention and illus- 

 tration, although it should be mentioned, that the order of precedency has been 

 inverted there, and the brachy-cephalic, not the dolicho-cephalic people, have 

 been supposed to have come first. 



III. The next important aberrant form is one that is remarkable for hori- 

 zontal expansion, and which we have denominated plaiy -cephalic. The cranium 

 is not deficient in longitude, but does not impress the eye by its length on ac- 

 1857. 




44 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



count of being equally expanded in breadth. It forms a skull of considerable 

 capacity, and is well exhibited in the cranium from the Western Hill Barrow, 

 No. 6, although not very apparent in the lithograph of the profile. 



IV. These are the chief aberrant forms. It is probable there may be another 

 distinguished by the extreme elevation of the vertex, to which the name of 

 aero-cephalic is applicable. It is not unlikely that the skull from the Barrow at 

 Kennet, near the famous avenue and megalithic circle of Avebury in Wiltshire, 

 in the lithograph No. 9, is an instance. Its extraordinary facial form we fear 

 is partly to be attributed to some distortion arising from an imperfect restora- 

 tion from the fragments to which it was reduced when found. 



From the remarks now made, it will be seen that our investigations are far 

 from giving countenance to a doctrine, announced by a very respectable 

 authority, that in primeval times the skulls of mankind were much more alike 

 than in the present day, that they were, as it may be said, "stereotyped" in 

 one mould. So far from this we believe it may be proved in this field, as in all 

 others, that diversity within certain definite limits has been the beautiful law of 

 nature from the first. 



In stature we have reason to know the ancient Britons varied a good deal. A 

 famous skeleton of a British chieftain, discovered in a coffin made out of the 

 trunk of a tree, in 1834, at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough, and now preserved 

 in the Museum of that town, measured 6 feet 2 inches in height. Another 

 skeleton, also from the North Riding of Yorkshire, in the rich Museum of British 

 antiquities of Mr. Bateman, of Youlgrave, in Derbyshire, measures only 5 feet 

 3 inches in height. Whilst that of a British woman in the same Museum, from 

 a Derbyshire Barrow called " Wagon Lowe," near Buxton, measures 5 feet 5| 

 inches in height. 



No one has labored so earnestly, so diligently, and with so much pains and 

 care as the late Professor Morton to bring the test of the measurement of crania 

 of various races to tlie elucidation of different obscure problems of anthropo- 

 logical science. It becomes us, therefore, to explain what little information we 

 have been able to collect upon this subject. At present it is but little, still in 

 the course of another year or two we trust to make it much more complete. In 

 bringing our present imperfect evidence before the Academy, we hope to be ex- 

 cused for remarking, that we are not inclined to expect quite so much or quite 

 such conclusive information from the determination of the capacities of crania 

 as Morton did. And we are satisfied that a much more extended observation, 

 upon a more defined basis than he adopted, is requisite to develope data of a 

 reliable character as to the relative capacities of difi'erent series of skulls. One 

 great source of error will require to be eliminated, arising from taking any series 

 of crania above a certain age, provided they are not idiots, indiscriminately^ and 

 without regard to the relative numbers of the different sexes. For instance, from the 

 remarkable and well known difference in the size of the skulls of men and of 

 women of the same race, if we have an equal number of crania of two races to 

 compare together, the one series containing a greater number of those of women 

 than the other, the whole calculation will be vitiated. But without dwelling 

 further upon tlaese questions at present, we will give, in a tabular form, the in- 

 ternal capacities of a few ancient British crania, merely explaining that they are 

 all those of men, and are taken with dry sand by weight. In order, however, 

 to render them as far as possible available for comparison witli Morton's great 

 table laid before the Academy in the year 1849, and published in the "Pro- 

 ceedings" for that year, we have converted them into the denomination of cubic 

 inches employed by him, and arranged the figures exactly as he did. 



Number of Ancient British skulls of men 11. 



Largest internal capacity 110-15 cubic inches. 



Smallest do. 87-7 " 



Mean do. 98-6 " 



These results do not admit a strict comparison with the table of Morton, on 

 the ground already stated, that the British skulls have belonged to men exclu- 

 sively. Still we shall be safe in comparing Morton's largest internal ca])acity 



[Feb. 




NATUEAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45 



with ours of 110-15 cubic inches, for, no doubt, both were derived from the 

 skulls of men. The largest internal capacity in his whole table, 114 cubic 

 inches, was found in the skull of a Dutchman, who was born at Utrecht and 

 died in Java. In fact, it is the largest cranium in the grand Mortoniau collec- 

 tion. A skull of an ancient Briton found in Green Lowe, in Derbyshire, which 

 has probably belonged to a Ooritanian, has a capacity of 110-15 cubic inches, 

 or within 4 cubic inches of the same size. The largest of Morton's English 

 skulls had an internal capacity of lOG cubic inches, or 5-15 cubic inches less 

 than the Green Lowe Barrow cranium. And the largest of Morton's Anglo- 

 American skulls was no less than 13 cubic inches Ic-ss than this from the Green 

 Lowe Barrow in internal capacity. From this small and imperfect amount of 

 evidence we appear to be justified in concluding that the crania of the Ancient 

 Britons were by no means deficient in internal or cerebral capacity. Much 

 more numerous observations arc, however, required before any data can be de- 

 duced on this subject, of a nature as satisfactory as the evidence will admit. 



It may not be impertinent to mention here, parenthetically, that the skull of 

 largest internal capacity we have met with, is au ancient Iri>sh calvarium, found 

 in 1855 at a depth of 10 feet in Suffolk street in Dublin; of course the term 

 ancient in this place must be taken conditionally, as applying probably to 

 medieval and not to pnmeval times. The internal capacity of this calvarium is 

 notless than 123-5 cubic inches, or very nearly 10 cubic inches more than that 

 of the Dutchman of noble birth in the i\[ortonian Collection. 



An assertion is frequently made by the advocates of the progressive develop- 

 ment and improvement of all races, which it may not be improper to allude to 

 here. They maintain that the influence of what is denominated civilization is 

 able to develope the brain of any race materially in the course of ages, and con- 

 sequently its osseous case. This doctrine of development is distinct from that 

 which affirms that different races of men are distinguished by crania of different 

 capacities ; on the contrary, it supposes that all races may, by a process of 

 civilization and development attain to a large capacity of the skull and corres- 

 ponding great brain. As far as the observations of ancient British. crania we 

 have previously mentioned, they do not give any countenance to this theory of 

 development. And, we may add, that our further observations, although neither 

 so numerous nor so extensive as they ought to be, and as we hope to make them, 

 on ancient Roman and on Anglo-Saxon skulls, are equally far from rendering 

 this doctrine support. Of the hitherto few skulls already engraved in the 

 " Crania Britannica," we may refer to one ancient Roman skull derived from the 

 city of York, the Roman "Eburacum." The internal capacity of this cranium 

 amounts to no less than 104-7 cubic inches. Another fine cranium of an Anglo- 

 Saxon derived from an ancient cemetery in Cambridgeshire, has an internal 

 capacity of no less than 109-6 cubic inches. As far, therefore, as these data go, 

 they give no countenance to the assumption that, as races proceed in their ad- 

 vancement from the state of barbarism upwards, their brains gradually expand. 

 With the capability of all races to make this advance, another assumption that 

 is usually associated with the former, we have nothing to do at present. 



It would be quite unnecessary to remark upon the permanency of cranial 

 forms before an Academy presided over by Morton, any more than to dwell upon 

 primitive diversity, which has already been alluded to. But the series of sknlls 

 to which the attention of the Academy has been solicited, afford additional evi- 

 dence which bears upon these points. And an attentive consideration of ancient 

 skulls will develope a series of remarkable diversities. 



Professor Morton, in his elaborate and well-reasoned work, " Crania ^gyp- 

 tica," which stands in so near a relationship to this Academy, has pointed out 

 in the most masterly manner the characteristics of the cranium of the ancient 

 Egyptians. That delicate cranial form was proper to them, whom Morton ulti- 

 mately concluded to be indigenous to the valley of the Nile, and strictly abo- 

 rignes. It was we, believe, deserving of the epithet idiogeneous, or especially 

 proper to the race, and had a relation to them alone, and to no other race, an- 

 cient or modern. There is a peculiarity in the generality of the mummified 



1857.] 




46 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



heads of the ancient Egyptians, well seen in the skulls also, ■which Morton has 

 not expressly mentioned, but which always strikes us at the first glance. Like 

 all ocular impressions, it is more readily perceived than described. But it arises 

 from the particular outlines by which the profile of the cranium is circumscribed. 

 The base line, the most essential feature, runs along the whole of the base of the 

 lower jaw from the tip of the pointed chin, and passing thence directly to and 

 along all the external centre of the occipital bone as far as its tuberosity. This 

 base line may be seen to be totally at variance with the line which bounds the 

 ancient British skull in the same direction from the profiles before the Academy. 

 "We believe it is only found in crania of an African lineage, and in none so level 

 and uniform as in those of the ancient Egyptians. If we let down upon this 

 base a facial line, which shall run along the forehead, and, with only a slight 

 deviation, till it runs also along the forepart of the pointed chin, we thus bound 

 the cranium in these two directions by right lines, which meet at a more acute 

 angle than in any other race. They are strictly Egyptian in their character, for 

 in the negro races this facial line has no proper commencement from the re- 

 ceding forehead, and is seriously interrupted by the prognathous jaws and teeth. 

 It is the form we have thus endeavored to analyse and describe which imparts 

 to the ancient Egyptian skull its delicate and elegant character. 



How diverse is the robust erect form of the ancient British skull, marked by 

 great depressions of the facial surfsice, and instead of the graceful long nasal 

 bones, abrupt and short ones, standing immediately below the frowning frontal 

 protuberance, with the intervening hiatus. All which features impress the 

 mind with feelings of a much less complacent kind, and inevitably lead to the 

 conviction that we have before us the representation of a bold uncivilized nature 

 — full of power, and not deficient in capacity, but quite incapable of refinement 

 and the graces of cultivation. These Egyptian and British cranial forms are 

 strikingly at variance, although probably owning an equal antiquity — indeed 

 we see no good reason whatever, why these different people may not have been 

 primeval contemporaries ; and yet the marks of diversity they present are as 

 clear and sharp as any that can be adduced among any modern people. They 

 point, therefore, in an irresistible manner to a primordial difference. 



The ancient Britons themselves, it is probable, may be regarded as an idio- 

 geneoiis race, i. e., taken as a whole proper in their characters, physical and 

 moral, and distinct from all others. Whether the ancient Gauls resembled them 

 in all particulars, seems very doubtful. They admit of comparison with other 

 people of ancient and modern times, but we are inclined to think, were we able 

 to realize a faithful and complete picture of them, it would present irreconcila- 

 ble discrepancies with other races. They had many marks of agreement with 

 the Indian Tribes of North Amei'ica. They dwelt in a temperate region, where 

 animal and vegetable life was abundant, and devoted themselves to the chase, 

 in which they were assisted by the aborignal hounds of Britain. Claudian, in 

 his allusion to these dogs, represents them as capable of overcoming bulls.

The Britons were equally possessed of the small indigenous horse of the coun- 

 try. They also found in the native forests animals of chase of equal, nay great- 

 er, magnitude than that of the Buifalo of the prairie, and, we have reason to 

 think, were as successful as the Indians of the northern part of this continent 

 in their pursuit of them. A Barrow opened in the parish of Cherhill near Calne 

 in Wiltshire, in 1833, revealed a number of bones, and among them were the 

 enormous horns of an ox, the horn-cores of which had a circumference of 15J 

 inches at the root, and in their widest expansion, a diameter of 33 inches. Be- 

 sides this collossal ox they had other bovine cattle, and deer, of the hunting of 

 which with hounds the Romano-British pottery aS'ords numerous pictures, as 

 it seems to have been a favorite subject with the artists for the Samian ware. 

 It appears at first view an astonishing circumstance that the weapons of chase, 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 47 



the arms and implements of the ancient Britons should be almost identical with 

 those of the ancient race of Indians of this continent. The same siiear-heads, 

 arrow-heads, axes, &c., of the earlier North American Indians are of the same 

 forms as those of the ancient Britains, and they differ only in material. Instead 

 of the constantly occurring flint of the Britons, the North American tribes have 

 used flint more sparingly, and a series of other hard and beautiful stones, sueh 

 as chalcedony, jasper, crystal, &c., for the production of these weapons. To 

 the kinduess of Mr. Franklin Peale, a highly esteemed Member of this Academy, 

 the writer is indebted for a very fine collection of the stone implements and 

 weapons of the North American Indians, Avhich excited surprise to find them so 

 closely approximating to those of the ancient Britons. The truth is the resem- 

 blance now alluded to seems to be confined by no limits of latitude or longitude. 

 The stone weapons and implements from Japan in SiebokVs Museum at Leyden 

 we found to be scarcely distinguishable from the British ; and we have also 

 seen flint spear-heads from New Zealand, not only closely api>roximating the 

 ancient British ones, but actually fashioned with the same number of strokes, 

 given in the self same direction. 



In accordance with the prevailing views on the origin and distribution of 

 man, this extraordinary similarity in the stone weapons and other utensils of 

 such widely distributed races has been ascribed to the distribution of the 

 makers, and the communication of the art. An hypothesis, we believe, out of 

 the limits of possibility by any natural means of difl'usion. Whereas, the simple 

 circumstance that these weapons are all produced by beings of similar jiowers 

 and capacities, having similar wants, and similar objects wherewith to satisfy 

 those wants, is an adequate explanation of the phenomenon ; and according to 

 all right principles of philosophy should be admitted at once. 



That the ancient Britons adopted the flexed or crouching posture in the in- 

 terment of the dead, just as the Indian races of America, we have abundant evi- 

 dence. This again is a practice generally diffused among all uncivilized races, 

 the aborigines of Australia adopting it, as well as others. There need be no 

 question also, that it is to be referred to some common cause operating on all 

 alike ; very probably to a desire to imitate that posture which is both easy and 

 agreeable to them, in the hut or around the fire, and associated in their minds 

 with the most pleasing recollections of life ; therefore fittest in which to renew 

 life, and to begin again the social intercourse and delights of another world be- 

 yond the tomb. For it should never be forgotten that savages, as we call them, 

 are not brutes, but richly endowed with all the sentiments of the human mind, 

 and animated by its highest aspirations. 



How far the ancient Britons advanced in that general development which we 

 call civilization, it is difficult to ascertain. That the more southern tribes, es- 

 pecially, received from the Phoenician traders, implements and weapons of bronze, 

 and learned the art of manufacturing such themselves, is now pretty satisfac- 

 torily determined ; although it is very questionable whether these superseded 

 the earlier stone ones wholly anywhere, but especially in the remote districts of 

 the country. Their fate was by a succession of imperial armies to be kept in 

 check, to be subjected to a succession of conquests, and ultimately to be in large 

 part reduced to -slavery, whether in their native regions, or in Italy and in the 

 other dependencies of the empire. Those who can lay claim by descent to the 

 nearest relation to the aborigines of the British Islands are still a peculiar people, 

 marked in every feature of their characters by traits which distinguish them 

 from the races of other blood with whom they have been for so many ages in 

 contact. Thus proving that the lineaments of nature cannot be effaced by all 

 the chances and changes of time. 



We have now gone over the subject proposed to be discussed — perhaps in a 

 somewhat too long and discursive manner, with a view of rendering it more 

 easy to be understood by those to whom it is probably not very familiar — as fiir 

 as it seems desirable at the present time. And it only remains for the writer 

 to express his appreciation of the mark of honor conferred upon him by this 

 learned Academy in allowing him to address them, and more especially in per- 

 1857.]

Gen. Remarks. This is the first time that the genus Tachydromus has been 

 recognized to exist on the African continent, sexlineatus being found in China, 

 Cochin China and Java ; and Japonicus in Japan. This genus is also found in

the Loo Choo islands. The African genus differs in no respect from the Asiatic, 

 except in the presence of the small plate imbedded between the inter-nasal and 

 frontal and the two fronto-nasals. 



Fam. CHALCIDIANS or CYCLOSAURIANS. 



(Sub-fam. Ptycliopleuri.) 



There are two specimens of Gcrrhosnurus in the collection of Dr. Ford, one 

 much smaller than the other and jjrobably the young. The Larger one resem- 

 bles in its coloration Gerrhosaurus Bibronii, of S. Africa, but the measurements 

 differ both from those of that species and of typicus.

These dimensions more nearly correspond with those of flavigularis, but in 

 that there are ten rows of ventral scutes. 



G. validus is a much larger species, and sepiformia and subtessellatus do not 

 in the least resemble it, (vide Smith, Illustrations of the Zoology of S. Africa.) 

 We therefore consider these two specimens as belonging to a new and un- 

 described species, with the following characters: — 



Gerrhosaurus nigro-lineatus. 



Char. Eight rows of ventral scutes; six superior labials ; body slender; tail 

 long, two yellowish vittae, one on each side of the back, commencing at the 

 occiput and lost upon the tail; within each vitta a black band running the 

 whole length of the back ; the interspace marked with black spots assuming more 

 or less the form of longitudinal lines well marked upon the tail ; flanks, in the 

 young white spotted, under parts yellowish. 



Description. The body is slender, covered above and upon the sides with 

 twenty-five longitudinal rows of carinated scales; the interspace between these 

 and the ventral scutes occupied with six rows of granulations ; tail long and 

 tapering, cyclo-tetragonal at base ; the rostral plate presents an acute angle 

 above, and articulates on either side with the first labial and the naso-rostral ; 

 the nostril opens between three plates, the naso-rostral, the naso-frenal and 

 the first labial ; the naso-rostral are well developed, in contact, with a convex an- 

 terior margin, the internal quite short, the posterior concave, where they articu- 

 late with the inter-nasal ; the naso-frenal are in contact inferiorly with the first 

 supra-labial, above with the inter-nasal ; the inter-nasal is a large plate, more 

 extended laterally than longitudinally, its inferior and lateral margin in contact 

 with the first frenal ; the fronto-nasals are tw'o in number and in contact ; 

 the frontal is hexagonal, longer than broad, more narrow posteriorly, its lateral 

 margins excavated ; there are two fronto-parietals, a little larger than the fronto- 

 nasals, and like them pentagonal ; there are two large parietals, with a small 

 inter-parietal, broader anteriorly; the second frenal is much larger than the 

 first ; there are two small freno-orbitars, the first longer than the second ; there 

 are four supra-orbitars, with a longitudinal row of as many plates beneath 

 them, and there are six supra-labials ; the posterior geneials are considerably 

 larger than the anterior ; the mental is broader than long ; there are eight longi- 

 tudinal rows of quadrangular ventral scutes, more or less striated, and fourteen 

 anal pores on each side ; the preanal scales are five in number, the lateral ones the 

 most developed ; scales upon outer surface of thighs, legs and forearms strongly 

 carinated ; there are thirteen transverse rows of scales between the occiput and 

 the anterior extremity; the total number between the occiput and the posterior 

 extremity fifty-one; one hundred and eleven verlicillas upon the tail ; auricular 

 opening triangular, with a large scale in front; eight scales upon right temple, 

 nine on left, in three rows, the posterior of the middle row the largest.

Coloration. Head oli\'e colored above, spotted with black ; two yellow stripes, 

 one on each side of the back commencing at the occiput, and lost nearly mid- 

 way upon the tail, bordered with a band of black internally ; interspace olive, 

 black spotted, having the appearance of lines upon the tail ; extremities 

 olive colored above, posterior part of thighs yellow spotted ; abdomen ccerulean 

 blue ; the remainder of the under surface yellowish. Young white spotted upou 

 the sides upon a bluish ground, and a double row of white spots along the back 

 between the black colored bands ; sides of tail white or yellow spotted.

Phractogonus galeatds, nob. 



Proceed. Acad. N. S., vol. vi. p. 62. The length of this specimen is 1 ft. 2} 

 inches ; of tail 1 inch 4 lines. A very singular looking animal. The contrast 

 between the narrow mosaic looking quadrangular scutes upon the back, and 

 the two longitudinal rows of broader ones is quite striking; the tail is short 

 and rounded at its posterior extremity, which is protected by a circular mamme- 

 lonated shield. The figure of the plate in the wood-cut of the nostrils in the volume 

 of the Proceedings referred to, does not appear to be accurate, this plate being 

 more extended longitudinally, reaching to the extreme end of the rostral, where it 

 is quite narrow terminating almost in a point. The single lateral pore on each 

 side of the preanal scutes is very distinct and is no doubt a constant character. 

 This species appears to be allied to the Cephalopeltis Cuvierii of Miiller, 

 which has two plates upon the top of the head, (Zeitschriftfur Physiologie, von 

 F. Tiedemann, G. R. & L. C. Treviranus, Vierter Band. Erstes Heft. 1831, 

 Taf. xxii, iig. 5, a, b, c. Dr. Smith in speaking of Monopeltis capensis observes, 

 that although I have put forward this species as a type of the group, I doubt if its 

 more extended observation will justify the proceeding. It may prove to be only 

 a very aberrant species of Lepidosternon, and if so Cephalopeltis Cuvieri, Miiller, 

 will be a species of the same group, only a degree less removed from the typical 

 form. The most marked difference between the species in question and Lepi- 

 dosternon macrocephalum, Wagl., consists in the covering of the head ; in the 

 latter it is formed of many plates, in Cephalopeltis of two only, and in Mono- 

 peltis of one. (Illustrations of S. African Zoology, Reptiles, pi. xvii.)

Proc. Acad. N. S., vol. ii. p. 5S. Six specimens, (four adult,) (one immature,) 

 (one quite young.) 



In a specimen from Liberia, the white stripe extends about half way along 

 the side of the body, but it is more extended on the opposite side, and in all the 

 specimens from the Gaboon there are two white vittae on each side, the lower 

 one commencing in front of the eye and terminating at the posterior extremity ; 

 the upper one beginning at the occiput and reaching as far as the root of the 

 tail, the lower band the broader of the two ; four narrow black lines along the 

 back, two on each side, becoming lost upon the root of the tail where they as- 

 sume more the form of spots ; the row of white spots passing along the side 

 of the neck and body as far as the extremity of the tail mentioned in the former 

 description, is no doubt identical with the upper lateral vitta; under surface 

 immaculate. I do not observe that the inter-parietal is larger than either of 

 the fronto-parietals in any of the specimens; in the one from Liberia it is 

 longer. In all the Gaboon specimens the fronto-nasal are separate; in the one 

 from Liberia they are almost in contact.

 lateral vittae ; abdomen greenish with a tinge of yellow, immaculate ; the green 

 much more marked upon the sides ; 33 rows of scales, tricarinate upon back and 

 sides; total length 5 inch. 4 lines; from extremity of snout to anterior extremity 

 1 inch ; between anterior and posterior extremities 1 inch 4 lines ; of tail 3

EUPREPES ALBILAHKIS, nob. 



Char. Supero-nasals not contiguous, inter-nasal much broader than long, 

 fronto-nasals in contact, more extended laterally than longitudinally; fronto- 

 parietal very narrow anteriorly ; scales 3-keeled ; color olive, black spotted, a 

 black irregular band passing from behind the eye along the sides, margined in- 

 feriorly with white; upper lip white; under parts bluish mingled with green 

 upon the abdomen ; chin yellowish. 



Description. This specimen is much smaller than any of those of Blandingii, 

 and differs from them all, even the young, in a marked manner, both in the 

 shape of the cephalic plates and in the coloration. The rostral plate presents 

 nothing remarkable, the supero-nasals are narrow, situated obliquely, a short 

 distance apart; the inter-nasal is hexagonal, much broader than long, with 

 an obtuse angle posteriorly, its lateral margins quite short; the fronto-nasal 

 are closely in contact (separate in Blandingii), and are shorter and more ex- 

 tended transversely than ia the latter species ; the frontal is quite narrow pos- 

 teriorly, presenting an obtuse angle in front ; the fronto-parietal differ much in 

 appearance from those of Blandingii, theiranteriorextremitiesbeing very narrow 

 and their lateral margin longer ; the inter-parietal is quite slender posteriorly, 

 with a moderately acute angle posteriorly ; there are eight supra-labials, the 

 sixth long and quadrangular (fifth in Blandingii), and situated immediately be- 

 neath the eye ; twelve transverse rows upon the back counting from one white 

 lateral margin to that on the opposite side. 



Coloration. Bronze or olive above, with irregular black spots ; a black band 

 from posterior margin of orbit, broad and well defined upon temples, more 

 narrow upon sides where it appears to be lost near the middle, with an irregular 

 margin superiorly, bordered with white inferiorly ; upper lips white ; under 

 parts bluish mingled •with green upon the abdomen ; chin with a tinge of 

 orange. 



Dimensions. Length of head 9 lines ; greatest breadth 3 ; length from head 

 to vent 13J lines; between anterior and posterior extremities 8}; from snout 

 to anterior extremity 6} ; arm 2 lines ; forearm 2 ; palm to tip of longest finger 3 ; 

 of thigh 2^; of leg 2; of sole to extremity of longest finger, 4^ lines, (tail 

 mutilated.) 



Habitat. Gaboon. One individual presented by Ford. 



A single specimen of a Scincoid described in Vol. VI. of the Proceedings 

 of the Academy, p. 64, under the name Acontias elegans, biit much larger, and 

 which evidently belongs to a genus distinct from Acontias. This specimen 

 measures 8 inches and 8 lines in extent, the tail 2 inches 10 lines, circumference 

 1 inch 3 lines. There are twenty-two transverse rows of scales, and one hun- 

 dred and seventy-three longitudinal, including fifty-six upon the tail ; there are 

 no eyelids, but the eye may be distinguished situated near the middle of a scale 

 at its anterior margin. The Typhline of Cuvier, from the Cape of Good Hope, 

 the only species of Typhline described by Dumeril and Bibron and by Mr. Gray, 

 is represented by the former to be without other cephalic plates than that which 

 encloses the whole face, as in a sort of case, (etui,) Mr. Gray, however, mentions 

 1857].

an internasal, a frontal, an interparietal and two parietals, but in both descrip- 

 tions the preanal scale is represented as single. 



The scales upon the head, as given by Mr. Gray, are very different 

 from those of the genus under consideration, the characters of which approach 

 nearest perhaps to those of Feylinia, Gray, Cat. Lizards of British Museum, p. 

 129, in which the preanal scales are numerous. Feylinia is characterized as 

 having a moderate rostral, no eyes, with scales in front of the vent like those of 

 the belly, and a tapering tail, a description which does not represent our animal. 

 The scales upon the back appear to be somewhat larger than those upon the 

 sides ; those upon the abdomen and under part of tail are very finely striated, 

 upon the back also, but the striations are less distinct. 



Should no generic name have been previously given to this Scincoid, we would 

 propose that of SpUenorhina.

Gen. Remarks. Dendrophis Chenonii, Reinhardt, appears to be a different 

 serpent ; the anterior frontals in the figure of that species (Reinhardt, nye Slan- 

 genarter, fig. 13,)* are quite small ; in L. smaragdinus their internal margin is 

 much larger than that of the posterior, the reverse is the case in D. Chenonii. 

 L. smaragdinus is now one of the best determined species first described in 

 print, and very accurately, by Prof. Schlegel. 



Among the specimens sent by Dr. Ford is an arboricole serpent, having a 

 general resemblance to Leptophis smaragdinus, but which, on a careful examina- 

 tion, differs so much in its characters from those of Leptophis, that we do not 

 hesitate to make it a distinct genus, and for the following reasons : The head is 

 more robust and not so long, the anterior frontals are smaller comparatively, 

 the vertical is shorter, as are also the occipitals ; indeed, all the plates upon the

top of the head, although having a general resemblance, differ in fact from the 

 corresponding plates of smaragdinus ; the nostril, instead of being between two 

 nasal plates, (the naso-rostral and naso-frenal,) is situated between the naso- 

 rostral and the frenal, which, however, may be accidental ; the frenal plate is 

 considerably less narrow ; the eyes, instead of being oval, as in smaragdinus, 

 are round or subround, and much more prominent ; the temporal plates are five 

 in number, in two longitudinal rows, three in the inferior and two above ; in 

 smaragdinus there are four, two below and two above ; in another, younger 

 specimen, four on one side, three on the other, but differently arranged ; the 

 number of superior labials is the same in each, viz., nine, the fifth and sixth 

 immediately beneath the eye; but the shape of these plates diflVrs in the two 

 animals, no two being alike; the posterior and superior angle of tne sixth in 

 smaragdinus is much more prolonr;ed upward and backward, and the seventh is 

 much larger ; the middle labial and the accessory labials differ in form, but the 

 difference most to be remarked is between the posterior geneials, which in smarag- 

 dinus are very long and comparatively slender ; the scales in the one snake are 

 long, narrow, and strongly carinated, in the other perfectly smooth, much less 

 narrow and quadrangular, and there is a difference of three and a half inches 

 in the length of the tail. It may be interesting to compare this serpent with 

 Herpetodryas aestivus and Dryophylax viridissimus, two slender green serpents, 

 the one from Surinam, the other from the United Slates. Herpetodryas astivus 

 and Chlorophis heterodermus are of nearly the same length, there being a differ- 

 ence of about 7 lines ; but the difference between the tails is greater, that of 

 iestivus being, in the specimen examined, 1 inch 81 lines longer ; but how marked 

 is the difference in the shape of the frontal plate ; the nostrils in Herpetodryas 

 open in a single plate, and although in both there are but one preocular and two 

 postoculars, they are altogether different in form ; in the one the eye rests upon 

 the fifth and sixth supra-labials, in the other (Herpetodryas) upon the fourth 

 and fifth. The arrangement and number of the temporal plates is difl'erent; in 

 Dryophylax, which is a much stouter and longer serpent, the frontal plate differs 

 from either of the others, the prefrontals pass down upon the side of the head 

 as far as the supra-labials, the pre- and postoculars, although the same in number, 

 still differ in shape, the position of the nostril is different, being between two 

 plates, the eye rests on the fourth and fifth supra-labial plates, and the size of 

 the eye differs, being smallest in Herpetodryas, largest in Chlorophis. If we 

 compare the supra-labials in the three we shall find them each of a peculiar 

 type ; in Dryophylax the sixth and seventh being remarkable for their large size. 

 The scales upon the body are also different. If we examine the teeth compara- 

 tively, we shall find that in Chlorophis the maxillaries, which are smooih, pre- 

 sent a marked curvature anteriorly, the points inclining backward, the three 

 posterior longer than the other, the two last more especially, which are also 

 much more robust ; neither of the posterior teeth appear to be grooved. In 

 Herpetodryas the teeth are smooth and resemble each other, (Aglyphodontes 

 isodontiens, D. and B.) In Dryophylax the posterior maxillary teeth are longer 

 and channelled, (Opistoglyphe dipsadien, D. and B.) Dryophylax is a South 

 American genus, exclusively, so far as is known, but Herpetodryas. according to 

 Dumeril and Bibron, exists not only in America, but in Madagascar and the 

 Isle of France. The following are the generic characters of Chlorophis : 



Maxillary teeth recurved, the posterior ones less than the anterior, the three 

 last larger than the others, the two hinder ones especially, which are not chan- 

 nelled ; nostrils between anterior nasal, and frenal; frenal remarkable for its 

 large size ; one antocular, two postoculars ; nine superior labials, the eye resting 

 on the 5th and 6th, and a very small part of the founh ; three anterior supra- 

 labials small, the three posterior large ; rostral rather high ; two internasals and 

 two prefrontals, vertical, pentagonal, much broader anteriorly, longer thau 

 broad, excavated laterally, presenting an acute angle behind ; occipitals pent- 

 agonal, well developed; supra-oculars not projecting; eyes round and quite 

 prominent; scales smooth, in 15 rows, quadrangular, about twice as long as 

 broad anteriorly, broader posteriorlv, the inferior row the largest ; a single pre-

Gen. Remarks. We at first supposed that this serpent might be identical with 

 the Dendrophis Chenonii, Reinhardt, from Guinea, but the nasal in that 

 species is between two nasal plates, and according to Dumerii and Bibron, the 

 preanal scute is double. They also state that were it not for the difference in 

 the teeth, they would consider it a true Dendrophis; now Dendrophis has a 

 much larger row of scales along the middle line of the back, which Chlorophis 

 has not. Dumerii and Bibron also mention that in Leptophis Chenonii there 

 are 154 urostega — M. Reinhardt, 108 — 126. 



Fam. LYCODONTIANS. 



Among the serpents in the collection of Dr. Ford, are three different genera 

 of Lycodontians, three of different ages belonging to the genus Boedon, and two 

 of undescribed genera. We propose to give an account of them, and also a 

 Boedon presented some time ago by Dr. Burtt, U. S. Navy, from the Isle de Los. 



The family of Lycodontians is characterized by Dumerii and Bibron as "ser- 

 pents with smooth teeth, or unchannelled, always unequal, the anterior longer 

 than those which follow, distributed in numerous series upon the jaws, and 

 without vacant spaces between them. Body cylindrical ; head larger behind 

 than the neck," the essential characters being the existence of smooth teeth 

 (Aglyphodonts) " of unequal force and length in both jaws." Erpet. Gen. tom. 

 vii. p. 357. The Lycodontians are divided into four tribes : 1, Boedonians ; 2, 

 Lycodontians; 3, Eugnathians ; 4, Pareasians. In the Boedonians the palatine 

 teeth are unequal, the submaxillary teeth separated; those above not separated. In 

 the Lycodontians these teeth are distinct, isolated ; the anterior pterjgo-pala- 

 tine teeth not longer than those which follow ; the submaxillary teeth unequal. 

 In the Eugnathians the submaxillary teeth are not separated by a free space, 

 the pterygo-palatine equal; and in the Pareasians, as in the Eugnathians, the 

 mandibular teeth are much longer in front than those which succeed them, but 

 in the former the anterior pterygo-palatine teeth are much longer. 



The essential characters of the sub-genus Boedon, belonging to the first 

 tribe Boedonians, and the family Lycodontians, the ninth of the Aglyphodont 

 Ophidians, in Dumerii and Bibron's arrangement, consist in having "the four or 

 five superior maxillary teeth longer by half than those which follow, and which 

 are nearly equal among themselves and regularly spaced ; then a free interval ; 

 the four or five first palatine teeth longer ; the five first inferior maxillaries longer 

 and more curved." 



Bo.lilDON QUADRIVITTATUM, nob. 



Char. Two white vittffi bordered with fuscous on each side of the head, the 

 inferior commencing behind the eye and extending as far as the angle of the jaw, 

 the superior passing over the eye and upon the temple, expanded inwardly upon 

 the occiput, forming two large white irregular blotches, one on each side, uniting 

 with its fellow on the opposite side, upon the internasals and prefrontals, poste- 

 riorly extending about 1|^ inch upon the neck, where it is lost. Body and tail 

 uniformly brown above, white beneath with dark colored maculations. 27 rows 

 of scales; a single preanal scute. Total length 2 feet 8^ inches. 



Description.. The head is of moderate size, depressed, covered above with nine 

 plates ; the internasals are considerably smaller than the prefrontals ; the latter 

 are in contact laterally and interiorly with the fren il, posteriorly with the 

 frontal, and by their postero-external margin, which is incurvated, with the

superior antocnlar ; the frontal is long, presenting a nearly straigbt margin an- 

 teriorly, its sides scarcely incurvated, its posterior angle acute, passing a con- 

 siderable distance beyond the supra-oculars ; the supra-oculars are five-sided ; 

 they do not project over the eye ; the nostrils are between two plates, their 

 superior maroin in contact with the internasal, the posterior margin of the 

 second with the frenal, its postero-superior with the prefrontals ; the frenal is 

 obloDg, more or less quadrilateral, or rather pentangular, about twice as long 

 as broad ; there is one large antocnlar of singular shape, five-sided, larger above, 

 the surface by which it is in contact with the prefrontal, convex, the postero- 

 superior by which it is in contact with the supra-ocular and the frontal concave, 

 as well as the anterior and posterior margins ; there are two post-oculars, the 

 first somewhat quadrangular in shape, the inferior five-sided; the rostral is 

 broader than high, its latero-superior margins excavated, with an acute angle 

 above, its inferior margin also excavated, its lateral margins rounded ; there 

 are eight supra-labials, no two of them are precisely alike in shape ; the second 

 is higher than the first, and is quite narrow above ; the third is quite large, four- 

 sided, about as broad as long, the fourth smaller than the third, the firth five- 

 sided, the eye resting upon the upper margin of the fourth and fifth, which are 

 excavated to receive it; the sixth also pentangular, but higher than the fifth; 

 the seventh also pentangular, but in a different manner, and broader than the 

 last ; the eighth also pentangular, but broader than either the sixth or the 

 seventh, with a more obtuse angle above, and its summit lower than that of 

 either of the two last mentioned plates ; the middle labial is long, having an 

 acute angle posteriorly, broad in front ; the accessory labials are also long, and 

 pointed behind, the anterior geneials longer and more developed than the pos- 

 terior ; there are seven inferior labials; two parallel rows of large plates upon 

 the temples ; superior maxillary teeth of nearly equal size and moderately 

 curved, except the five anterior, which are longer, more robust, and more 

 strongly incurvated ; anterior inferior maxillary teeth longer than the others; 

 palatine and pterygoid teeth in two long rows, not straight, but slightly curved 

 anteriorly, presenting an ovoid interspace posteriorly ; tongue enclosed in a 

 sheath, with two slender pointed filaments in front ; ne;k not so 'thick as poste- 

 rior part of head ; body moderately robust, becoming more slender toward the 

 tail, which is of moderate length and tapering, but not pointed at its extremity : 

 the flanks present no remarkable angularity ; the scales are smooth, lanceolate 

 and narrow anteriorly, broader posteriorly ; there are 27 rows at the middle of 

 the body, 25 near the neck, 20 near the tail, upon which there are from 6 to 15 

 rows.

Ilahitat. Isle de Los. One specimen presented by Dr. Burtt, U. S. N. 



We have in the collection of Dr. Ford three specimens of a serpent formerly 

 described in the Proceedings under the name Caelopeltis virgata, but which is a 

 species of Boedon, and although allied to the species above described, differs 

 from it in the following particulars : The largest of the specimens is considera- 

 bly smaller than quadrivittatum ; the head is shorter and more obtuse ante- 

 riorly ; the temples more protuberant ; the frontal is more narrow ante- 

 riorly, less acute posteriorly ; the superior labials resemble those of quadri- 

 vittatum sufficiently, but there is a difference in t^e form of the frenal and ant- 

 ocular plate ; there is also but a single row of temporals, with a single large 

 one situated between the parietal and the three plates constituting this row;

the shape of the scales does not differ materially, but the number is less, there 

 being but 23 rows near the middle of the body, from four to 11 rows upon the 

 tail. The two lateral stripes oq each side of the head are of a yellow color and 

 more narrow, and meet at the rostral, the interspace forming an acute angle, 

 whereas in quadrivittatum they meet upon the internasal and prefrontals, dis- 

 playing a quadrangular interspace.

Sp. Char. Head short and thick, more narrow in younger specimens ; snout 

 obtuse; frontal plate of moderate breadth anteriorly, posterior angle somewhat 

 obtuse; 23 rows of scales ; two narrow yellow lines on each side of the head, 

 the superior commencing at the rostral, passing over the eye and upon the 

 temple, extending about three lines upon the side of the neck ; the inferior 

 commencing at the middle of the posterior margin of the orbit, passing obliquely 

 over the inferior post-ocular, the three last superior labials, and crossing the 

 angle of the mouth, extends in an oblique manner a distance of three lines, and 

 terminates at the line of junction between the neck and throat, at a distance of 

 two lines from the superior lateral stripe.

 middle, the external portions of the gastrostega brown; the intermediate space 

 spotted with brown ; under part of tail brown. 



Total length 2 feet 2 inches. 



Abd. scut. 205 ; sub-caud. 45. 



Description. The scales are somewhat broader than in the last described spe- 

 cies ; in the younger specimens the head is more narrow, the temples less pro- 

 jecting, upon which are observed two rows of temporal plates. In each of these 

 specimens there are but 23 rows of scales. In one the internasal and prefrontals 

 are fused together. Gastrostega 202 ; a single preanal ; urostega 47, in 

 2d 190—55.

 body 1 feet 11 inches 3 lines; of tail 3 inches 4 lines. 



Habitat. Gaboon, west coast of Africa. Four specimens in Mus. Acad, N. S., 

 presented by Dr. Henry A. Ford. 



Sub-Fam. Eugnathians. 



The first of the two serpents about to be described, belonging to the sub- 

 family or tribe Eugnathians, presents a series of remarkable characters such 

 a3 belong to no serpent with which we are acquainted, and which constitute a 

 genus to which the name Hormonotus may be applied. 



HORMONOTUS,* nob. 



Ocn. Char. Head Lycodontiform ; the temples swollen ; the snout rounded ; 

 the eyes prominent, looking upward and outward ; internasals considerably 

 smaller than prefrontals ; vertical long, pentangular ; nostril between two plates ; 

 a frenal ; one antocular, three postoculars ; the eye resting on the fourth and 

 fifth supra-labial ; two of the anterior teeth of the lower jaw quite large, the pos- 

 terior stouter at the base, and longer than the anterior ; two long anterior teeth in 

 the upper jaw preceded b}' several small ones, followed by an interspace with- 

 out teeth, and eight or more maxillaries of nearly equal length ; palatine and 

 pterygoid teeth in two long rows, presenting an ovoid space posteriorly ; scales 

 smooth, with a larger hexagonal row along the median line of the back; tail 

 of moderate length, tapering to a point, with double urostega ; ventral scutes 

 passing up along the sides in a nearly rectangular manner.

[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 57 



Description. The head is depressed ; the snout rounded ; the temples swollen ; 

 the nostrils, which are large, are situated in a depression between two plates ; 

 the eyes prominent, latero-superior, circular, the pupil ovoid, perpendicular ; 

 the rostral plate is pentangular, much more broad than high ; the internasala 

 are of moderate size, the prefrontals of much greater dimensions, their external 

 and inferior border in contact with the frenal, their posterior with the antocular, 

 the supra-ocular and the frontal plates ; the supra-ocular are pentangular, much 

 more narrow anteriorly ; the frontal is five-sided, its lateral margins scarcely 

 excavated, its posterior angle moderately obtuse, two and a quarter lines in 

 length by about one and a half in breadth ; the parietals are three lines in length 

 by two in breadth, much more narrow posteriorly ; the frenal is rathf r long and 

 of moderate breadth, in contact inferiorly with the second and third supra-la- 

 bials ; the antocular is larger than either of the three postoculars, and is pent- 

 angular in shape ; there are two rows of temporal plates, surmounted by a 

 third, of which the posterior is the largest ; there are nine superior labials, the 

 eye resting on the fourth and fifth ; no two are precisely alike, the first is the 

 smallest, the seventh pentangular, a line in breadth by half a line in height ; 

 there are seven inferior labials, each differing more or less in shape, and of 

 which the fourth is of much greater dimensions than either of the others; the 

 mental is triangular, the accessory labials rather long, the first geneial much 

 larger than the second. The neck is much more narrow than the head, is rather 

 long and slender; the body of very moderate thickness; the tail one-fifth of 

 the total length. There are 15 to 17 rows of smooth scales near the middle of 

 the body, 18 upon the neck, 12 near base of tail ; the scales are short and quad- 

 rangular upon the middle, more narrow upon the neck, broad upon the tail ; 

 the scales constituting the dorsal row are considerably larger than the 

 adjoining rows, and each scale is hexagonal in shape ; this larger row extends 

 upon the tail, but in the specimen examined appears to be interrupted near its 

 root. Ab. scut. 221 ; 1 single preanal ; 81 bifid sub-caud. 



Dimensions. Length of head 9 lines; greatest breadth .5.V; length of body 1 

 foot 8 inches 7 lines ; length of tail 5 inches. Total length 2 feet 2 inches 4 

 lines. 

 Habitat. Gaboon, west coast of Africa. 



Gen. Remarks. The outline of the head and the general arrangement of the 

 plates, has a certain resemblance to the figure of Lycodon audax (Lycognathus 

 scolopax, D. and B.) in the altas accompanying the Physiognomie des Serpens 

 of Prof. Schlegel, pi. iv. fig. 18, but it is quite a different serpent from the latter, 

 which is found in South America. It has also a certain relation, in the general 

 disposition of the plates upon the head and teeth, with Lycognathus cucuUatas, 

 a North African serpent, but a comparison of the two proves at once that they 

 belong to different genera. The outline of the head, the relative proportions of 

 the internasals and prefrontals, and the form of the frontal plate, are very dif- 

 ferent ; the nostrils are deeply excavated in Hormonotus ; in cucullatus there is 

 no larger dorsal row, and the scales are shorter, &c. It is also a much smaller 

 animal. 



The species which remains to be described is a quite different looking serpent 

 from the last, presenting a series of generic characters quite remarkable, more 

 especially the form of the frontal plate. 



Gen. Char. Head cuneiform, eyes small, two small inter-nasals, two large pre- 

 frontals, a frontal about as broad as long, presenting an acute angle posteriorly ; 

 nostril in a single plate at its posterior margin, two nasals, a frenal, one 

 antocular, two postoculars, seven superior labials, the eye resting on the third 

 and fourth ; several small teeth on the upper jaw, followed by a much larger 

 one, after which an interspace, succeeded by a row of small and nearly equal 

 teeth ; maxillaries of lower jaw presenting a corresponding system of dentition ; 

 but the interspace behind the larger teeth do not exist apparently ; body 

 nearly the same thickness as head ; tail short; scutes bifid.

Lycophidion laterale, nob. 



Sp. Char. Uniformly reddish brown above and olive below, with the exception 

 of two lateral yellow vittEe on each side of the head, the one reaching to the 

 angle of the jaw, the other to the posterior margin of the occiput; 17 rows of 

 smooth scales. 



Description. Head cuneiform, flat above, shelving forward, the plates exhibiting 

 the appearance of a polished surface ; snout rounded ; rostral plate much 

 broader than high, with an obtuse angle at its summit ; the inter-nasals 

 are quite small compared with the pre-frontals, their external margins in con- 

 tact with the nasal and the first frenal ; the pre-frontals are quite large 

 presenting an acute angle externally, where they are in contact with the first 

 and second frenal and the antocular; the frontal is short and broad, its pos- 

 terior angle acute, its anterior and external corners bevelled, the inter- 

 mediate space undulating; it measures nearly a line and a half in length, by 

 one and a quarter in breadth ; the supra-oculars are quite short, about one-half 

 their usual length, broader posteriorly; the posterior half of their external 

 margin in contact with the superior post-ocular ; the parietals are large, much 

 longer than broad, in contact anteriorly with the supra-ocular; the first post- 

 ocular, and by a very small facet at their anterior and external angle, with the 

 second posterior ocular ; there is one frenal plate, longer than broad, with 

 ♦ an acute angle posteriorly ; it is in contact above with the pre-frontal ; it pre- 

 sents a somewhat obtuse angle, and two surfaces inferiorly, the anterior in 

 contact with the first supra- labial, the posterior with the second ; its anterior 

 and superior border is much broader than its posterior, which is externally 

 narrow ; the antocular is a remarkably large plate, more narrow above, in con- 

 tact inf, ricrly with the second and third supra-nasal, above by an oblique facet 

 with the frontal, anteriorly by a convex margin with the pre-frontal, posteriorly 

 with the eye, and the anterior border of the supra-ocular plate; there are two 

 post-oculars, the inferior the larger of the two ; there are eight superior labials, 

 no two precisely alike, the first the smallest, the sixth, which is pentagonal, the 

 largest, the eye resting on the third and fourth ; the third is separated from the 

 anterior margin of the orbit ; the fourth supra-labial and the antocular inter- 

 vening ; the nasal plate is somewhat quadrangular in shape, the nostril being 

 situated in its posterior half, its posterior border in contact with the anterior 

 border of the naso-frenal, which presents an oblique facet without any sinuation 

 whatever; the plates upon the top of the head are all highly polished; the eye 

 is small, the pupil ovoid, rather than round ; there are two rows of temporal 

 plates, three in the inferior, two in the row above, and a large quadrangular 

 plate between these and the parietals; immediately behind the parietals, are two 

 smaller plates than the latter, with a still smaller one between them ; the 

 mental and accessary labials present nothing remarkable ; the anterior geneials 

 are quite broad, larger than the posterior, which are much more narrow ; four 

 small teeth precede the larger one in the upper jaw, then follows an interspace 

 succeeded by nine or more small teeth of nearly equal size ; anterior to the large 

 tooth in the lower jaw are also several smaller ones, succeeded by a row of nine 

 or more small teeth, the anterior a little the largest on the left side, but not in 

 the right; the palatine teeth are in two long rows, and present an ovoid space 

 posteriorly ; the neck is of nearly the same thickness as the head behind, the body 

 thicker, the tail short and robust, rapidly tapering to a point ; the scales are 

 smooth and shining, those upon the neck more narrow, those upon the body 

 broader, with rounded posterior angles ; the inferior row perhaps a litile the 

 largest; there are 15 rows upon the neck, 17 upon the middle of the body, 8 

 near the root of the tail ; the scales upon the tail appe^ir to be irregular, about 

 three lines from the vent they are homogeneous, but posterior to this space may 

 be observed two parallel rows of hexagonal scales broader than the others, suc- 

 ceeded by siualler ones, and then a single row of four narrow and quite broad 

 hexagonal plates ; the gastrostega are narrow, the sides of the abdomen not 

 angular.

Coloration. The neck, body and tail are brown above, inferior parts brown 

 with a tinge of olive, presenting a shining and a polished appearance, especially 

 the ventral and sub-caudal scutes; a yellow vitta on each side of the head 

 meeting upon the muzzle, and extending as far as the extremity of the occiput ; 

 a more narrow one extending from the posterior margin of the eye to the angle 

 of the mouth. 



Dimensions. Length of head H lines ; greatest breadth 3^ ; length of neck and

Abdom. scuta 176, a single preanal, 44 snb-bifid-caudal.

Gen. Remarks. The serpent above described belongs apparently to the genus 

 Lycophidion of Fitzinger, but does not correspond in all respects with the ad- 

 mirable description of the Eugnathians by Dumeril and Bibron, particularly in 

 the size of the eyes, which they represent as " tres grands", and the form of the 

 abdomen which is described in the species observed by them as flat, in our 

 specimen being much rounded.* In other respects there appears to be a perfect 

 coincidence. But two species are enumerated by them both from South Africa, 

 viz: L. Ilorstockii and L. scmicinctum ; the first is white beneath, the second 

 is brown, but has a series of reddish bands across the back ; both want the 

 lateral yellow vitlae of L. laterale.

 phis Kirllandii, Id. Proceed. Acad. N. S. vol. vii. 1854, p. 100 ; Oxijbelis Le- 

 comptei; Dumeril et Bibron, vol. vii. p. 821. These specimens measure 4 ft. 2 

 inches in length, tail 1 ft. 7 inch. 10 lines. I find 19 rows of scales near the 

 middle, 17 upon the neck, 6 near the root of the tail; the nostril is large and 

 ovoid in a single nasal plate; there are two frenal plates in both specimens on 

 each side of the head, the posterior in the one being much larger than the cor- 

 responding ons in the other, the anterior more narrow than the anterior one of 

 the other in the same side ; on the right side in one they are narrow and oblong, 

 in the other the anterior is much smaller than the posterior; one antocular, two 

 post-oculars on the right side, three on the left in one ; in the other three 

 posterior on the right, three on the left; eight superior labials; the eye resting 

 on the fourth and fifth in both specimens; posterior geneials quite long; the 

 scales are long and slender, the inferior row the largest ; the tail at its extremity 

 almost filiform ; the p'ates upon the top of the head, though not corresponding 

 precisely in the cut, have the same general proportions; 170 gastrostega, a 

 double preanal, 166 urostega, 175 in another, urostega 168. 



Gen. Remarks. The description of this " Arboricole opistoglyph" by Dumeril 

 and Bibron is very characteristic of its specific relations, and extremely accurate, 

 but they are in error in stating that it had never before been described, the first 

 account of it having been given by us in the second vol. of the Proceedings of 

 the Academy, 1844, p. 62, a fact for which I am indebted to Prof. Aug. Dumeril 

 himself, but who had not previously seen the animal. 



The collection of Dr. Ford contains a fine specimen of Dipsas Blandingii, Hall., 

 Proceed. Acad. N. S. vol. ii. p. 170, and vol. vii. p. 100. It is, however, not a 

 Dipsas, and we propose for it the generic name Toxicodryas. This remarkable 

 Arboricole serpent measures 5 ft. 7 inch. (Fr.) in length, tail 1 ft. 4 inch. ; 22 

 rows of scales may be counted at the middle of the body exclusive of the large 

 hexagonal dorsal row, 17 rows more posteriorly. The former description char-

 well authenticated specimens of Lycophidion to compare with it ; future observa- 

 tion must determine whether the former or latter name shall be retained.

acterizes the external form of the serpent sufficiently well, but it may be added 

 that the supra-labials are for the most part bordered with black, and that 25 

 large blotches may be counted on each side of the body ; upper part of neck of 

 same color as occiput, probably green during life. There is but a single chan- 

 nelled posterior tooth on each side in these specimens, and therefore they cannot 

 belong to the genus Triglophodon of Dum. and Bibron, which has three ; the 

 posterior geneials are longer than the anterior, but of about equal breadth. 



TOXICODRYAS, nob. 



Gen. Char. A single tooth channelled anteriorly in the posterior part of the 

 upper jaw, much longer than the others, and more robust ; the other superior 

 maxillary teeth smooth, of nearly equal length, well developed, and equally 

 spaced but wide apart, the two anterior somewhat shorter; five or six in num- 

 ber; pterygopalatine teeth well developed, the anterior the longest; three 

 anterior teeth in the lower jaw longer than the others, and stouter, the three 

 posterior the smallest, the three intermediate ones smaller than the three anterior, 

 but larger than the three posterior ; unequally spaced ; head covered above 

 with nine plates ; a rostral broader than long, two broad inter-nasals, smaller 

 considerably than the pre-frontals ; a frontal of moderate length, but broader 

 anteriorly; supra-oculars remarkable for their great breadth posteriorly; 

 parietals of moderate size ; nostrils large, lateral, between two plates ; a quad- 

 rangular frenal ; two anterior and two posterior oculars; two rows of plates 

 between the parietals and supra-labials ; eye resting on the fourth, fifth and 

 sixth of the latter; body very long and much compiessed ; scales long, narrow 

 and quadrangular ; a dorsal row much larger, hexagonal ; abdominal scutes 

 extending upon the flanks ; sides of abdomen angular ; tail long with bifid 

 scutes.

Habitat. Liberia and Gaboon. Two specimens, one presented by Dr. Wil- 

 liam Blanding, the other by Dr. Henry A. Ford. 



Gen. Remarks. We formerly placed this serpent in the genus Dipsas, from its 

 large head, compressed body and the large row of hexagonal scales along the 

 middle line of the back; but a careful examination of the teeth, as well as of 

 the external form, shows that it does not belong to that genus ; it is one of the 

 most remarkable of the Arboricole Opystoglyphs, so characteristic of the her- 

 petological fauna of the western coast of Africa; we had supposed also that this 

 serpent might be identical with the Dipsas cynodon of Schegel, (Opetiodon cy- 

 nodon D. and B.) but in Opetiodon there is but one pre-ocular, the flanks are 

 rounded, pupil oval, &c. The frontal and supra-ocular plates in Toxicodryas are 

 quite different in shape from the corresponding plates in the figure of Dipsas 

 cynodon by Prof Schegel (Abbildungen, pi. xi. fig. 10 and 11,) the supra- 

 oculars being more narrow iu front, the frontal more narrow posteriorly; the 

 two last supra-labials are different in shape and much larger in Toxicodryas 

 than in fig. 11. In 0. cynodon, the pre-oculars are almost contiguous to the 

 frontal, in T. Blandingii they are separated by an interval of about a line, seven 

 or eight temporals instead of five, of which three touch the post-oculars (two 

 in T. Blandingii.) Cynodon is a native of Java and Borneo. The characters 



[Feb. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 61 



of the serpent above described, resemble much those of Triglophodon fuscum, 

 also from the Gaboon, (D. and B. vol. vii. p. 1102, Appendix,) but it has three 

 channelled posterior teeth. There can be no doubt that although allied, Toxi- 

 codryas and Trit^^lophodon are distinct genera; compared with a specimen of Tri- 

 glophodon dendrophilum from Java, of which we have a fine specimen in our 

 colleclion, due to the liberality of the administration of the Garden of Plants, 

 through Prof. Dumeril, we find that the scales in T. Blandingii are more narrow, 

 the tail lousrer and more slender, and the plates upon tlie head different ; the 

 vertical in T. Blandingii is much more narrow posteriorly, the rostral not so 

 high, the parietals are much smaller; there are ?m-o pre-oculars, and the in- 

 ferior margin of the orbit is formed by the fourth, fifth and sixth supra-labials ; 

 in Triglophodon by the third, fourth and fifth, &c. Both have a large row of 

 scales along the middle of the back. Toxicodryas is a genus quite distinct from 

 Tarbophis, (Ailurophis, Bonap.) 



Sub-Old. Proterogli/phs. 



Among the serpents in the collection of Dr. Ford, is one of the black variety 

 of Naja, six feet 31 inches in length. There is also a younger and much more 

 slender specimen. Besides these we have another and much larger one than 

 either, presented several years ago by Dr. Ford, measuring G ft. 9,] inch. (Fr.) in 

 length. Neither of these correspond with the description or figure of the 

 black variety of Naja haje in Dr. Smith's work on the Reptiles of Southern 

 Africa. The most striking difference consists in the coloration, the South 

 African species being uniformly black below, the variety from the Gaboon hav- 

 ing upon the anterior part of the abdomen a greater or less number of black 

 bands of unequal breadth, the interspaces being yellow, the throat and chin also 

 yellow, (white probably during life). Dumeril and Bibron state that the Mu- 

 seum of Paris possesses three large specimens of the black variety described by 

 Dr. Smith, one from Senegal, one from Morocco, the third from the White Nile, 

 They admit but two species of Naja, the tripudians and haje ; in the first the 

 sixth superior labial is quite small, in the latter very large ; which also wants 

 the spectacle figure upon the neck, and the neck is less dilatable. 



This difference between the labial plates, however, is presumed to be not an 

 invariable character. In the plate of Naja haje in the great work on Egypt, 

 there are several black bands passing across the abdomen, near its middle, one of 

 them very broad, more so than in any of the Gaboon specimens, which in that 

 variety are also situated much more anteriorly. Dumeril and Bibron state that 

 in the greater part of the specimens they possess from Java, Sumatra, China and 

 difl'erent regions of the East there are several gastrostega of a beautiful black, 

 forming a transverse band more or less broad, followed by other scutes of a 

 white color. Comparing the large Gaboon specimen with A. tripndians, from 

 Bengal, I find a single dark colored band nine lines in breadth, running 

 across the anterior part of the abdomen, quite near to the throat, and as 

 stated by Prof. Schlegel the sixth supra-labial much smaller than the cor- 

 responding one in the African species. In the tripudians this plate is sepa- 

 rated from the post-oculars by a large plate, in N. haje it is in contact with 

 them. There is a difference in the proportional size of the inter-nasals and 

 pre-frontals, but this may be merely the effect of age ; for, although the former 

 are comparatively much smaller than the latter in the adidt W. African speci- 

 mens, they more nearly correspond in the younger individual as they do in that 

 from Bengal. The frontal plate is pentagonal in both, but in the Asiatic 

 specimen it is quite narrow.* In the E. India serpent there are 23 rows of 

 scales near the middle of the body, in the Gaboon but 19. We have not the 

 materials for a thorough study of the two admitted species, but consider those 

 from Gaboon as belonging to a variety of the haje, for which the name melano-

Gen. Remarks. This is one of the largest and most savage looking of the 

 venomous serpents. Dr. Smith gives from 5 to 6 feet as the length of the 

 South African species. According to him they feed on small quadrupeds, birds 

 and eggs, and climb trees readily to rob nests. The genus Naja belongs to the 

 4th section or sub-order of Ophidians in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, viz : 

 The Proteroglyph or Apistophid serpents (serpents Proteroglyphes dits Apisto- 

 phides,) of which the essential characters given are, — 



" Serpents in which the anterior teeth are channelled and not perforated at their 

 base," and to the first group into which this section is subdivided, viz : the 

 Conocercal Proteroglyphs, (P. conocerques) having a conical or rounded tail ; 

 the second group, the platycercals, and which live in the water having this 

 organ flat. The family of Conocercals includes nine genera, viz : Elaps, Pseudo- 

 elaps, Furina, Trimersurus, Alecto, Sepedon, Causus, Bungarus, Naja, two- 

 thirds of which exist in our collection. In the largest of the three specimens 

 there are two large and strong anterior channelled teeth, of about equal length 

 on the left side ; on the right side one, having behind it one or two smaller teeth. 

 In the other specimen but a single one is seen on each side; palatine and ptery- 

 goid teeth in two longitudinal rows.

We have now three specimens of this deadly but magnificently robed serpent 

 in our collection, two adult and one very young, all from the Gaboon ; the ser- 

 pent formerly figured in the Proceedings (1847, vol. iii. p. 320) having been lost. 

 V/e are ourselves now somewhat in doubt in regard to the animal described and 

 figured in the Proceed. Acad. N. S., vol. iii. p. 320, (1846 — 7.) The description 

 of the Echidna Gabonica, D. & B., given in the Erpetologie generale, corresponds 

 with it perfectly, and no mention is made, nor does the drawing display the 

 narrow headed black mark bordered with yellow, so characteristic ofE, nasicor- 

 nis, and the longitudinal bars upon the middle line of the back are not cut in tri- 

 angle at their extremities, which is the case even in the very young nasicornis. 

 Both specimens referred to have unfortunately been destroyed, the skull of the 

 adult alone remaining, which, however, I am inclined to believe belongs to E. 

 nasicornis. 



As no detailed account of this remarkable animal appears to have been pub- 

 lished, we propose to give a full account of it.

Sj). Char. Three horny projections on each side of the muzzle, the anterior 

 small, the posterior which is immediately over the nostril quite long. 



Description. The head is more or less triangular above, covered with scales, 

 very strongly carinated, the carinations so developed as to assume the form of 

 triangular leaf-like projections, giving a sensation of roughness to the latero- 

 superior upper part of the head ; there are three or four scales immediately 

 within the circular row above surrounding the eye, which are larger than the 

 others ; the carinie of these scales are less f )liated than the rest, and re- 

 semble spines ; the eye is of moderate size, ovoid in shape, and somewhat 

 projecting; the nostrils are large, on a line with the eye, three lines from it and 

 ar^not lateral, but look upward and outward; there are three foliated scales 

 upon each side of the muzzle, the posterior 6 lines in length ; the rostral plate 

 is broad and narrow with a convex margin above, concave below, very differ- 

 ent in shape from that of Vipera ammodytes ; there are sixteen supra-labial 

 plates on each side, most of which resemble each other in shape, presenting a 

 serrated margin inferiorly; there are sixteen superior labials which differ from 

 each other, and the anterior are more extended transversely ; the anterior geneials 

 are very large ; the posterior quite narrow ; the pterygo-palatine teeth do not 

 pursue a strictly longitudinal course but diverge posteriorly ; the fangs are 

 enormous and lie entirely concealed in their sheath; the neck is more' narrow 

 than the posterior part of the head, the body quite thick at the middle ; the 

 tail rather shorty terminating in a horn-like pointed projection ; the scales 

 are short and broad, strongly carinated, the inferior row much the largest ; 44 

 may be counted in a row near the middle of the body ; 18 on each side of the 

 neck, 16 rows at the base of the tail. Ah. scuta 128; sub-caud. 31 ; 1 long 

 preanal. 



Coloration. A dark jet black arrowheaded blotch upon the top of the head 

 commencing between the posterior horns, its hinder extremities reaching as 

 far as the posterior margin of the head, the middle portion being lost upon the 

 neck ; this blotch has a narrow border of yellow; upper and lateral part of the 

 head brownish, or brownish mingled with yellow ; a narrow stripe of yellow 

 commencing near the middle of the range of scales which margin the orbit 

 below, and terminating at the inferior margin of the twefth supra-labial, less 

 distinct in older specimens ; posterior to this a large dark-colored triangular 

 blotch reaching from the eye to the angle of the jaw ; a small triangular yellow 

 one upon the side of the head close to its anterior margin, its apex reaching 

 to within a line of the eye; the intervening space between it and the narrow 

 yellow stripe, dark colored, as well as that part of the side of the head in front 

 of the eye reaching to the anterior extremity of the muzzle, on aline with the 

 inferior border of the nostril ; upon the middle line of the back and tail a series of 

 oblong yellow blotches, with triangular emarginations anteriorly and posteriorly, 

 imbedded in a black ground ; sides dark brown, in younger individuals mingled 

 with reddish and yellow, black spotted; the lateral extension of the dark col- 

 ored blotches in which the yellow bars are imbedded triangular in shape; a 

 series of yellow spots on each side at the point of juncture with the abdominal 

 scutes; chin and throat orange mottled with black; abdomen and under part 

 of tail yellow, thickly mottled with black. 



In a very young specimen measuring 10| Inches in length, the coloration of 

 the head is nearly the same, the middle line of the back presenting a longitudinal 

 series of black rhomboids alternating with the lighter colored bars with trian- 

 gular emarginations ; these bars are much shorter upon the anterior part of the 

 body and upon the neck ; the posterior prolongations of the arrowheaded blotch 

 upon the head extend half an inch upon the neck, and present a triangular cut 

 posteriorly ; there is a series of large dark colored spots upon the sides alternating 

 with yellow ; chin and throat dark colored; abdomen thickly maculated with 

 dark subquadrate spots. 



Dimensions. Length 2 inches 3 lines ; breadth 1 inch 11 ; length of body 2 feet 

 8 inches (Fr.;) of tail 6 inches 7 lines. Total length 3 feet 4 inches 10 lines; 

 circumference 6 inches.

Habitat. Gaboon and Liberia. Three specimens in Mus. Acad, presented by 

 Dr. Henry A. Ford. 



Oen. Remarks. Dumeril and Bibron are evidently in error in placing this ani- 

 mal in the genus Vipera. In Vipera the nostrils are lateral, in Echidna latero- 

 superior. la Vipera ammodytes the rostral plate is very high ; the posterior 

 geneials differ much ; ammodytes has a large supra-ocular ; there is but one row 

 of plates between the supra-labials and the rows of scales which surround the 

 eye ; the scales in ammodytes are long, short in nasicornis. The same may be 

 said of Vipera aspis. Compared with Echidna arietans of the Cape, we find 

 absence of the supra-ocular, two rows between the scales beneath the eye and 

 the supra-labials, and the scales short, like those of nasicornis. The difference 

 in the number of rows of scales between the eyes and the supra-labials consti- 

 tutes a good specific character in serpents belonging to the same genus, but the 

 position of the nostrils and the form of the scales are constant and of generie im- 

 portance.* Echidna nasicornis belongs to the 5th section or suborder of Ophidi- 

 ans in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, viz., the Solenoglyphs, (serpents Sole- 

 noglyphes dits Thanatophides,) of which the following are the essential charac- 

 ters: 



" Serpents having teeth in both jaws, of which the anterior supra-maxillariea 

 are alone channelled and perforated by a canal in the length of their base." 



Ord. BATRACHIANS. 



In the synoptical table of the genera of Raniforms, in the 8th volume of Du- 

 meril and Bibron's work, (1841,) but two genera of the 16 there determined are 

 mentioned as having no palatine teeth, viz., Oxyglossus and Leiuperus ; the first 

 with a rhomboidal, the second with an oval tongue, in both entire. In Arthro- 

 leptis, Smith, (Illustrations of South African Zoology, 1849,) the toes are with- 

 out webs. la the Batrachian now under consideration, the most remarkable 

 structure is shown in the tongue, which presents a central pedicel, but is bound 

 down in its anterior half along the middle by cellular tissue, as in the genus 

 Heredia, among the Urodeles recently discovered in California. We pro- 

 pose for this remarkable Batrachian, and which, should this conformation be 

 found to exist in other individuals, would, from the connecting link between 

 the Anourous Batrachia, and the Caducibranchiate Urodeles, the name of 



HETER0GL0S3A. 

 Head nearly as long as the body, and about as long as broad, depressed above, 

 narrow in front ; teeth in the upper jaw small, smaller in front, posteriorly re- 

 curved, sharp-pointed ; nine in the lower jaw ; no palatine teeth; posterior nares 

 Buboval, eustachian foramina small ; tongue suboval, deeply notched posteriorly, 

 attached by a cylindrical pedicel at the centre, entirely free in its posterior half; 

 bound down anteriorly along the middle line by cellular tissue, reaching from 

 the tip to the pedicel, free laterally except at the apex; body short; toes free 

 anteriorly, webbed at their base posteriorly ; tympanum distinct. 



Heteroglossa. Africana, nob. 



Sp. Char. Chocolate brown above, abdomen ash colored ; posterior nares 

 small. 



Description. The head is about as broad as long, triangular in shape, rounded 

 in front, depressed above ; the eyes are of moderate size, not prominent ; the 

 tympanum also of moderate size, quite distinct, is situated immediately over the 

 angle of the jaw ; posterior nares suboval, small ; the fingers are quite free, the 

 first and second of about equal length, the fourth longer than these, the third 

 the longest; sub-articular tubercles distinct; extremities of first and second toes 

 nearly on a line with each other ; third toe longer than second, the fourth much 



* Since the above was written we have received the December number of

the longest, the fifih longer than either the first or second ; the toes are webbed 

 at their base, the web extending to about the middle of the antepenultimate 

 phalanx; abdomen perfectly smooth ; skin smooth above; no rows of porea 

 visible. 



Coloration. General color dark brown, or chocolate above, mingled to a Blight 

 extent with ash ; upper jaw presenting several chocolate colored spots upon a 

 lighter ground ; posterior extremities barred with dark brown approaching to 

 black ; abdomen ash colored ; chin and throat chocolate spotted ; under surface 

 of extremities blackish mingled with ash ; when examined with a magnifier 

 the body appears to be blotched all over with dark brown on a much lighter 

 ground.

It measures 1 inch 4 lines in length from the extremity of the snout to the 

 posterior extremity of the body; bead large ; body very slender posteriorly ; the 

 color is of a darker brown than in the adult, and a number of darker blotches 

 may be observed over diil'erent parts of the animal; a characteristic mark, and 

 one which does not appear to have been mentioned in the previous description, 

 consists in the presence of an orange-colored undulating line a short distance 

 above the auus, commencing on the posterior part of the thigh about two lines 

 from the latter ; beneath this line the ground color is more obscure. This line 

 exists also iu the adult specimen, but is of a yellow color.

 DACTYLETHRA, Cuvier. 



There i.s one specimen of Dactylethra, but this differs from the Dacty- 

 lethra of the Cape, and more especially in the presence of a sharp pointed 

 spur projecting from the cuneiform bone, which is not observed iu Dactylethra 

 capensis. 



Dactylethra Mullkri, Peters. 



Sp. Char. Black above, dark brown or chocolate below ; a cutaneous appen- 

 dage beneath each eye; numerous crypts upou the muzzle, chin, and under part 

 of the muzzle ; a series of larger longitudinal glands upon chin ; a sharp pointed 

 spur at base of first toe. 



Dcscj-iption. The head is small, depressed ; the snout rounded ; the eyes pro- 

 minent; the nostrils near the extremity of the snout a line apart, and three- 

 fourths of a line from the anterior border of the eye; the snout is quite smooth 

 above, but covered as far as midway between the eyes, (the posterior border of 

 which is but three lines from its anterior extremity,) with numerous small ele- 

 vated granules or crypts, the under part also, as well as the chin ; a semicircu- 

 lar row of longitudinal glands, nine or ten in number, Avith open mouths, four 

 or five in each longitudinal row upon the chin ; no tongue or palatine teeth ; 

 numerous small teeth in the upper jaw; ejistachian foramen large, broader than 

 long ; body large, subquadrate, about a line broader posteriorly, where, as Du- 

 meril and Hibron observe, it has the appearance of being truncate; perfectly 

 smooth both above and below ; with a ui:ignifier, however, presenting a minutely 

 granular appearance ; no lateral line of pores visible ; anterior extremities small, 

 posterior very large ; fingers free ; fourth finger stoutest, second longest, third

Uabilat. Gaboon. One specimen presented by Dr. Henry A. Ford. 



Gen. Remarks. Dactylethra belongs in Dumeril and Bibron's arrangement, to 

 the second group of the Anourous, or Phrynaglossal Batrachians, (Phryna- 

 glosses) and family of the Pipteformes, being entirely destitute of a tongue, 

 wheieas the 1st gioup, or the f haneroglossal, have this organ " developed in a 

 greater or less degree." The Phrynaglossal Batrachians, including but two 

 genera at present known, viz., Dactylethra and Pipa, have also this very re- 

 markable peculiarity, that instead of two eustachian foramina, there is but one, 

 and that situated at the middle of the posterior part of the palate. In Dactylethra 

 Mdlleti this is very large. We had proposed for this singular Pip^form the name 

 spinosa, from the spur at the base of the first toe, but having received the 12lh 

 number of the Revue de Zoologie for 1856, we find it mentioned and referr'^d to in 

 the interesting and important paper of Prof. Aug. Dameril, with the well known 

 and honored name Miilleri given to it in 1844 by Prof. Peters of Berlin, (Monats 

 Bericht ber Kon. preuss. Acad, zu Berlin, 1844, p. 37) who has found it also in 

 Mozamoique. 



Having now finished the notice of Dr. Ford's collection, which contains so 

 many animals new to science and of great importance in the study of the geo- 

 graphical distribution of Reptiles, I propose to correct some errors in former 

 papers of mine upon the Reptiles of Western Africa — which either had escaped 

 my attention, or which a better knowledge of the subject, and the aid of my 

 vade mecum in that branch of science, Dumeril and Bibron, have enabled me 

 to point out. Pachydactylus tristis appears to be identical with Platydactylus 

 theconyx, a common West India animal, the label indicating the locality having 

 been erroneous. Tropidolepis Africanus and Calotes versicolor are identical with 

 Agama Oolonorum. Python Liberiensis is identical with Python bivittatus, (Py- 

 thon kSebae, D. & B.) admirably described by Prof. Schlegel and long known. 



Bo.v LiuERiENSis. Proceed. Acad. N. S , vol. vii. (1854) p. 100. 



The animal indicated is not identical with Python Liberiensis, (Python 

 biyittatus, Schlegel,) the latter specimen having at the time been mislaid, but

Dendroi'his flavigularis, Proceed. A. N. S. vol. vi. p. 205. 



The Aboricole serpent described in the Proceedings of the Academy with the 

 above name is not a Dendrophis, but presents characters quite sulficient to consti- 

 tute it a new gentis. It differs from Dendrophis in the following i)articulars : 1st. 

 Dendrophis is an Isodontian, the teeth having equal proportions, the Sj' ncraterians 

 having the posterior longer. 2d. It wants the larger row of scales alongthe median 

 line of the back, characteristic of Dendrophis. 3rd. The eye in Dendrophis 

 rests on the fifth and sixth supra-labials. 4th. The rostral appears more 

 upon the top of the head, and the internasals are proportionably larger. 

 5th. In Dendrophis the frontal is more acute posteriorly, and the parietals are 

 longer than broad. Gth. In Dendrophis the frcnal is long and narrow and not 

 quadrate ; there are two post-oculars instead of three, and the temporal plates 

 are more numerous. 7th. The nock is more narrow in Dcndroj)liis, the abdo- 

 uiuu is an<>'ular and the scales are smooth. In llcrpctodryas (Isodontian) the

rostral opens in a ningh plate, tliere is but one post-ocular, tlic parietals are 

 long, the eye rests on the third and fourtli sui)ra-labials, and the shajic of the 

 scales is very dillerent, being lanceolate and not long and quadrangular; the 

 internasals arc smaller in proportion, the rostral docs not extend so far back- 

 ward on tlie top of the head, and the frontal differs in shape ; it approaches 

 more nearly Leptophis (Syncrateriau), a genus also existing on the AV'cst Coast 

 of Africa, but in Leptophis, the internasals are proportionately /ar^cr, the frontal 

 more acute posteriorly, the rostral quite different in shape, the frenal long and 

 narrow, but two post-oculars, the eye resting on the iifth and sixth supra-labials, 

 the latter plate being much prolonged at its posterior and superior angle, and 

 the posterior gencials, or intermediate sub-niaxillary plates, are longer than the 

 anterior and more narrow. In Bucephalus the scutes beneath the tail are bifid 

 for one-fourth of its lengtli, simple in the remainder, and the posterior teeth are 

 channelled (Opistoglyph) ; atc propose therefore for this remarkable Arboricole

 no larger or longer ones anteriorly, the posterior ones a little shorter ; neck 

 nearly as broad as jjosterior part of head, body long, rather stout in the middle, 

 covered with long and quadrangular imbricated and carinated scales of about 

 equal breadth except those of inferior row which are broader and shorter than 

 the others ; scales and scutes presenting a silken appearance ; abdomen angular 

 but not distinctly so, the gastrostega ascending obliquely upon the flanks ; tail 

 long, sub-caudal scutes bifid.

Gen. Remarks. The description in the 4th vol. of the Proceedings is quite ac- 

 curate, and characterizes this serpent well, except its dentition. Its jet black and 

 silken lustre, and large and somewhat impudent eyes, make, we should think, 

 this reptile one of the most remarkable among the Arboricole Ophidians so 

 numerous in Western Africa.

 latter of moderate length ; a small occipital ; neck more narrow than posterior 

 part of head, body cylindrical, covered with broad quadrangular scales at the 

 sides, hexagonal above ; tail rather long and tapering, sub-caudal scutes bifid. 



HETEaONOTUS TRIANGULARIS, nob. 



Sp. Char. Color light olive above, with about yfteen narrow transverse yellow 

 fascia; from six to eight lines apart, commc-nciug on the neck and terminating

 joining the apices ; 17 rows of scales near the middle ; ab. sc. 148, 1 bifid pre- 

 anal ; sub-caud. 100. 



Descrijjtion. The head is long, narrow and rounded in front, somewhat pro- 

 tuberant at the temples, covered above with nine plates exclusive of a very small 

 one looking like an occipital ; the rostral measures about two lines in breadth 

 by one in heighth ; presenting more or less distinctly three facets above, the two 

 exterior in contact each with the naso-rostral, the middle with the inter- 

 nasals, the external margin convex, the inferior concave ; the naso-rostral is 

 quadrangular, the naso-frenal rhomboidal in shape ; the frenal is also quadran- 

 gular with its supero-posterior angle rounded ; the two nasals are in contact 

 above with the internasals, the frenal with the pre-frontal ; the pre-ocular is 

 large, its superior portion much more so than the inferior ; rectangular below 

 triangular above, presenting an anterior and posterior angle and one superior, 

 in contact inferiorly with the third and fourth supra-labial, above with the pre- 

 frontal and supra-ocular ; there are two post-oculars, the inferior prolonged 

 forward, its anterior portion between the fifth supra-labial, and the eye, which 

 reclines upon it; the internasals are longer than broad, the pre-frontals on the 

 contrary remarkable for their breadth ; they pass down on the side of the head 

 between the naso-frenal and pre-ocular, to reach the frenal as above described ; 

 the frontal is remarkable for its length, and in this respect' differs greatly from 

 Coronella, in which it is short, and broader than long ; it is hexagonal and more 

 narrow posteriorly ; the supra-oculars are much longer than broad, more nar- 

 row in front; the parietals are of moderate size, in contact anteriorly with the 

 supra-ocular and the superior post-ocular ; there are eight superior labials on 

 the left side, the seventh and eighth on the right being fused together and pre- 

 senting one large plate ; the inferior margin of the eye rests on the fourth, wiiich 

 is more distinctly quadrangular, than any of the other superior labials ; there 

 are five plates between the supra-labials and the parietals, two in front and 

 three posteriorly; the anterior geneials are somewhat broader than the 

 posterior and not quite so long ; the supra-maxillary teeth are long, smooth, 

 unequally spaced, the posterior teeth the longest, the two anterior more recurved 

 than the others ; pterygo-palatine teeth much smaller, straight, their points 

 thrown far backward, in two long rows ; these rows are not parallel, but ap- 

 proach each other near the middle, and diverge anteriorly, the two presenting a 

 long urceolate outline ; the teeth in the lower jaw are much smaller than those 

 in the upper, shorter anteriorly; the neck is more narrow than the head 

 posteriorly, the body more or less cylindrical and much thicker in the middle, 

 decreasing toward the tail, which is of considerable length, and tapers to a 

 poiat; there are 17 rows of smooth scales near the middle of the body, the 

 same number upon the neck, 13 upon the tail near its root ; the inferior row of 

 of scales is the largest ; those upon the sides about as broad as long (U line,) 

 quadrangular ; those upon the back distinctly hexagonal, and somewhat 

 narrower; this difference in the form of the scales is. indistinct upon the neck 

 and posterior part of the body ; gasirostega rather broad but not ascending upon 

 the flanks which present no marked angularity. 



Coloration. Head yellowish above mingled with olive; the three or four pos- 

 terior of the superior labials bordered inferiorly with black, as well as the pos- 

 terior margin of the fourth ; several of the inferior labials margined with black ; 

 chin and throat yellow, black spotted ; ground color olive above, with about

(len. liemarks. The previous description in vol. ii. of the Proceedings contains 

 a number of absurd typographical errors, — and is in many respects incorrect. 

 This genus is closely allied to Coronella, but differs from it in the shape of the 

 frontal plate which is short and broad in the latter genus, in the form of the 

 internasals which are longer in Hcteronotus, in the pre-frontals which arc not 

 so long, the position of the eye and the. shape of the scales; the tail is much 

 shorter in Coronella, and the teeth not so strongly developed. Heteronotus is 

 another of the many '"emarkable forms recently discovered in Western Africa, 

 which promises to present the most valuable materials to the Zoologist in the 

 determination of the higher problems of science.

Coluber rhillipsii, id. Proceed, vol. ii. p. 1G9. The head of this species presents 

 numerous singularly shaped black markings above; the lips, chin and throat, 

 thickly spotted with black ; ground color of chin and throat yellow ; the black 

 points are much more distinct upon the flanks, scarcely visible upon the back; 

 gastrostega marked near their external extremities with a longitudinal black 

 mark or spot ; preanal scale single ; dorsal row of scales differently shaped from 

 the others ; two or three inferior rows of scales, larger than the rest, which, ex- 

 cept the dorsal row, are long, slender and quadrangular as in Dendrophis ; 17 rows; 

 tail mutilated. This species of Psammophis differs from all those described 

 by Dumeril and Bibron. 



Among the serpents not in the collection of Dr. Ford, but from Liberia, and 

 presented several years ago by Dr. Goheen, is a small Psammophis, probably 

 young, with 17 rows of scales, and 102 sub-caudal scutes. The coloration of 

 the head is different from that of the specimen just described. 



Char. Head marked with dark colored irregular lines, simulating Arabic 

 characters, more especially upon the parietals ; a more regular figure, long and

 the abdominal scutes ; chin and throat yellowish; abdomen greenish, mingled 

 with yellow; tail olive above, white below. Length 2 ft. 1 inch 2j; ab. scut. 

 247 ; sub-caud. 13 ; 1 single preanal. 



Description. The body is much compressed ; the scales all distinctly carinated ; 

 eeveaty-tive oblique narrow yellow bands maybe counted upon the body ; head 

 yellowish above, marked witb dark colored irregular Hues; the most conspicu- 

 ous of these are two irregular ones over the eyes and two large ones meeting 

 upon the middle of the frontal, and diverging in a V-shaped form, and extend- 

 ing as far as the posterior margin of the parietals, the right branch in the speci- 

 men examined continuous with another extending a short distance upon the 

 neck; these dark colored lines present longitudinal patches of yellow within; 

 scales of moderate length, rather narrow, presenting an angle posteriorly, the 

 carinaj in the middle, and running the whole length of the scale, the inferior row 

 the broadest; 22 rows near the middle of the body; on either side three rows of 

 narrower scales in the specimen examined, immediately above the second infe- 

 rior row ; flanks angular, abdomen fiat, but the gastrostega not ascending upon 

 the sides of the body ; tail of moderate length, tapering to a point. Plates of 

 head. A rostral broader than high, not extending upon the snout, two inter-nasals 

 and two pre-frontals, the former smaller than the latter ; a frontal longer than 

 broad, quite broad anteriorly, (2J lines nearly by 2 in breadth,) more narrow 

 posteriorly, distinctly hexagonal; parietals well developed, rather long, broad in 

 front; supra-orbitar long and narrow, presenting two facets displaying an angle 

 anteriorly, the superior in contact with the pre-frontal, the inferior with the 

 ant-ocular and two posterior, the inferior in contact with the superior post- 

 ocular, the superior, which is greatly extended, with the parietal; nostril between 

 two plates, the posterior much the larger, there being apparently no frenal ; a 

 single and large pre-ocular broader below ; two post-oculars, the inferior the 

 larger of the two; temporal plates but two in number (one above the other,) 

 between the supra-labials and parietals ; eyes of moderate size, round, resting on 

 the third and fourth supra-labials ; seven superior labials, the fifth quadrangular, 

 the sixth and seventh the largest; anterior genials broad, the posterior singular 

 in shape, broad, their external margin three or four times longer than the in- 

 ternal ; ab. scut. 247 ; sub-caud. 73 ; length of head 8 lines ; breadth Ah ; length 

 of body 2 ft. ; of tail 4 inch. 4 lines. Total length 2 ft. 1 inch 4 lines ; circum- 

 ference l.j inches.

Iq a. Blbronii, the ab. and sub-caud. scuta are given bj' Dr. Smith as 255, 

 20, and 225, 21. The drawidg iu the S. African Illustrations is mHgnilied 

 and tberet'dre the fangs iu both animals are probably of equal length. The 

 gtit-trostega are quite broad, and extend very slightly if at all ujion the flanks, 

 which are rounded; the neck is of about the same thickness as the head pos- 

 teriorly, not so thick as the body at its middle ; tlie geneials are broad and short, 

 there are no posterior ones, properly so called but a single row of larger scales 

 on each side within the supra-labials, the anterior the longest. The fangs in 

 this serpent are remarkable; they are probably more capable of erection than 

 Dr. Smith supposes, but their shape is [)eculiiir; they arc convex anteriorly, 

 concave posteriorly, with a superior and inferior ritlge, compressed laterally, with 

 an elevation in the middle, resembling somewhat a squalus tooth, but of course 

 much more narrow ; they are not channelled anteriorly, but a canal can be dis- 

 tinctly seen running along their middle, the tooth being perforated at its base. 

 It therefore takes its place among the Solcnoglyphs and not the Proteroglyphs, as 

 Dumeril and Bibron conjectured it should from its general resemblance to 

 Elaps, (a specimen of the animal not having at that time reached the Museum of 

 Paris,) and the family A'iperidie, characterized by the absence of fossettes be- 

 tween the eyes and the nostrils, which on the contrary exist in the Crotalidie. 



Gen. Remarks. We have endeavored in the preceding paper to give as cor- 

 rect an account as our means will permit of the West African Reptiles that have 

 come under our notice. All the specimens described or referred to in previous 

 numbers of the Proceedings as presented by Dr. Ford, come from the Gaboon 

 and not Liberia. This is an important correction, for the two countries are 

 widely separate, Monrovia, the capitol of Liberia being in North or Ujtper Guinea, 

 and the Gaboon in South or Lower Guinea; the difference in latitude between 

 the above mentioned town and the mouth of the Gaboon where Dr. Ford is 

 stationed as Physician to an American Missionary establishment being 450 

 miles, and in longitude 1400; the difference in space measured along the line of 

 the coast 1450 miles. This rectification is of much consequence in the study of 

 the geographical distribution of the Reptiles of[Africa. When we consider the very 

 great distance of the Cape of Good Hope from the Gaboon, it is not surprising 

 that the reptiles of the latter region should differ so much from those of the 

 former. Indeed, it is doubtful if among all the reptiles figured and described 

 by Dr. Smith, there be two absoliilrli/ identical and common to both countries. 



Dr. Smith mentions the tollowiug species known to exist in W. Africa, as 

 found also at the Cape, viz. : Kinixis erosa, Varanus niloticus, Chamadeo di- 

 lepis, Agama coIonorura,Dinophis angusticep3(NaiaS.)and Causus ihombeatus. 

 He enumerates nevertheless and describes 144 species belonging to 84 genera. 



According to Prof. Peters, of Berlin, the following species existing in W. 

 Africa are found also in Madagascar, viz., Cham;c!eo dilepis, OxybelJs Kirtlandii, 

 (Lecomptei, D. & B.) Echidna nasicornis, Dactylethra Miilleri, ( Archiv. fur Natur- 

 geschichte, 1855, p. 43,) and (Monatsberichte zu Berliner Acadamie, 1854, p. 

 C14.) 



Few countries probably present a more interesting field to the Herpetologist 

 than Africa, whether we regard the variety or the remarkable character of the 

 forms, and we hope, through the efforts of M. DuChaillu, who is travelling in 

 the Gaboon, with a view to discover if possible the source of the Congo or river 

 Zaire, and of Dr. Ford, who is stationed at the mouth of the Gaboon, that we 

 shall be enabled to develops more fully the Herpetology of that region. 



We have prepared the following list of the species inhabiting Liberia and the 

 Gaboon so far as known, and refer to the splendid work of Dr. Smith for those 

 found at the Cape. Those common to the two regions are printed in italics : —

Nothing is more striking in the study of the various reptilian forms above de- 

 scribed than the simplicity of the elements out of which so great a variety of 

 essential characters are deduced, constituting generic types, permanent in their 

 nature, andlinked from the beginning with circumstances of physical geogra})hy 

 not yet fully made out, l^ut which a more thorough and accurate analysis may 

 euable us to discover. It is probable that a careful and precise investigation of 

 the genera now determined, even by the most eminent Herpetologists, taking into 

 consideration not one or several sets of characters but the entire animal viewed 

 in regard, not only to its anatomy, whicliis of equal importance, but also its geo- 

 graphical position, and so to speak, its i)hysiology, will of necessity cause many 

 of them to be separa,ted, constituting either distinct generic forms, or sub-generic 

 types, associated naturally with the physical characters of the soil and climate 

 in which they live ; and hence it is of the utmost importance that those animals 

 not liable to changes of domicile as is the case with birds, and even the mam- 

 mals, should be collected from all known regions of the globe, their habitat 

 being ascertained with the greatest precision, and their anatomy studied with 

 care, so that we may be enabled to deduce the laws which govern their ex- 

 istence, and determine their characters, which cannot be done for a long time 

 to come, and until the facilities for the prosecution of such pursuits are much 

 greater than exist at the present time, but which we have no doubt will ulti- 

 mately be accomplished. Natural History, phj-sical geography and jdiysiology 

 are so intimately connected, that no real progress can be made without their 

 combined study ; and in this manner instead of the artificial and disjoint- 

 ed aspect which the first of these has often been made to present, we 

 shall have a system based upon nature itself, the only true and real foundation 

 of all progress whether in science or morals, or in the solution of those perplexed 

 I)roblems which at present so much and so fruitlessly disturb the public mind. 

 Inquiries of this kind, so far from promoting a spirit of irreverence, induce the 

 contrary, leading man not only in the letter, but better in the spirit, and in the 

 r>.'al constitution of things, to search out the laws which determine his well being, 

 and give rise in him to the most profound sentiments of humility and worship 

 of the great (Ji'cator, whose iutclligonte and power at every step excite his 

 wonder and admiration.

The death of Dr. E. K. Kane, U. S. N., late a member of the 

 Academy, was then announced; whereupon the following resolutions, 

 offered by Mr. Cassin, were unanimously adopted : — 



Resolved, That the Academy has heard of the decease of its distin- 

 guished member Elisha Kent Kane, M. D., of the United States Navy, 

 with deep sorrow, and regards it as a loss to the cause of science, and 

 to the country. 



Resolved, That the great abilities and enterprise of Dr. Kane entitle 

 him to the highest rank among scientific voyagers and explorers, and 

 that his many and valuable contributions to the collections of the 

 Academy, and his constant interest in it, entitle him to special regard. 



Resolved, That this Academy will attend the funeral of Dr. Kane, 

 and that a special meeting be called for that purpose. 



Resolved, That a copy of these Kesolutions be transmitted to the 

 family of Dr. Kane, and that the same be published.

Dr. Uhler stated : 



That on the night of the 10th inst., about 11.} o'clock, he was startled in his 

 residence at Manayunk, by a heavy rumbling noise, and shaking of the house 

 and furniture, and rattling of the windows ; the sound resembled that of a 

 heavy wagon drawn over hard frozen ground. In the course of four or five 

 seconds, the noise and trembling were repeated. Dr. U. raised the window im- 

 mediately, but found everything perfectly quiet ; there was no wind, and he 

 attributed the noise to an earthquake. 



The sound appeared to come from the north east, and then returned; the 

 whole duration was probably twenty seconds. He had no means of determi- 

 ning the amount or direction of the oscillation.

74 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



March VJth. 



Mr, AsHMEAD in the Chair. 



Mr. Ashraead made the following verbal communication regarding 

 specimens of Algae, presented by him this evening and upon a former 

 occasion : 



In the catalogue of Marine Algae from Key West, which I presented to the 

 Academy last April, there were five undetermined species of the genus Cau- 

 lerpa, and two of Laurencia. These, together with some others, supposed to 

 be new, I referred to Prof. Harvey of Trinity College, Dublin. 



I received a letter a few days since from that eminent Algologist, giving the 

 true names, which I have attached to the specimens on the table, as follows : 



Caulerpa mexicana. 



C. PLUMiGERA Harvey. 



0. PASPALOiDES Bory. 



C. SEDOIDES Ag. 

 C. PLUMAKIS Ag. 



Laurencia implicata Harvey. 



L. GEMMiPERA Harvcy. 



There were also three species in that catalogue which I erroneously named, 

 viz : 



SciNAiA furcellAta Bivona, I referred to Halymenia ligulata Ag. 



Ceramium nitens J. Ag., I had supposed to be C. rubrum Ag. — and Cryp- 

 tonemia crenulata J. Ag., I named, (at the suggestion of Prof. Bailey,) Phyl- 



LOPHORA BROADIiEI. 



There is a great similarity iji the external habit of these plants, yet they are 

 well distinguished by the internal structure of the frond, to which I had not 

 applied the microscope. 



In addition to my former catalogue, which is now corrected, I present this 

 evening 



TuRBjNARiA VULGARIS, var. |3. DECURRENS Boryg. 



This plant is interesting as an addition to our Marine Flora. It was known 

 to occur in the West Indies, but had not been detected on our shores, until I 

 found it at Key West. 



Dasya Harvkyi Ashmead. 



This is a new Dasya ; I obtained it at Key West with both kinds of fruit. 

 Prof. Harvey says, " This species is quite new to me, and I feel much gratified 

 by the compliment you pay me, by naming it D. Harveyi." 



Choudria attropurpurea Harvey. 



C. sedifolia Harvey. 



Laurencia papillosa Greves. 



L. cervicornis Harvey. 



Geranium tenuissimum Lyngb. 



Gracilaria armata J. Ag. 

 ■ Tonaria lobata Ag. 



Caulerpa Ashmeadii Harvey. 



In regard to this species. Prof. Harvey makes the following remarks : "As 

 far as I at present know, it is nondescript — but it is not new to me, for I found 

 it myself at Key West, but did not find it growing. It is a very remarkable 

 species, diifering from those of similar habit, in its greater size, and in the ex- 

 treme obtuseness of the pinnje." 



Of this rare species I found but one plant. It was growing in company 

 with Caulerpa plumaris, under the bridge leading to Fort Taylor, in a shady 

 position, and where it was sheltered from the action of the waves. Its fibrous 

 roots penetrated the coral sand for a* considerable extent, from which a number 

 of fronds sprung up at intervals. I collected every fragment I could find.

 but not impressed, they become obsolete at the latter fourth, and impressed at 

 their terminations, but the seventh and eighth are sinuate and impressed behind 

 to the very apex ; the tip of the third is not impressed : the marginal ceases at 

 the humerus : the first, fourth and fifth commence at the declivity of the base , 

 the others are a little shorter ; the intervals are entirely flat and the third is tri- 

 punctate. The legs are very dark rufous ; the anterior tibiae are armed exter- 

 nally with a small denticle, and an acute tooth ; the apical tooth is long and 

 curved, the inferior spur is one-third shorter, and slightly curved.

One specimen, Illinois, Mr. Wilcox. Of the same size as D. sphaericollis, but 

 more robust, and known at once by the ovate thorax and almost squarely trun- 

 cate clypeus. Blackish bronzed, shining : head with deep frontal impressions, 

 transverse line not profound : clypeus almost truncate with the angles rounded 

 not prominent; sides lobed as usual: antennae rufo-piceous, with the base red. 

 Palpi and mouth reddish. Thorax a little broader than long, ovate, narrowed 

 in front ; dorsal line and transverse anterior impression deep. Elytra not wider 

 than the thorax, less than twice as long as their width, convex : striae impressed 

 and entire, the first, fourth and fifth commence on the declivity of the base, 

 the others area little shorter, the eighth is obsolete and represented by only a 

 few punctures, but is deep at the tip : the punctures are moderately large and 

 extend a little beyond the middle ; the marginal stria ends at the humerus : the 

 interstices are flat, and in contact with the third stria may be seen two hardly 

 distinct dorsal punctures.- The body beneath is black ; the legs are dark red ; 

 the anterior tibiie have hardly a trace of external denticles, the terminal tooth 

 is long and gradually curved, the terminal spur is shorter and slightly curved.

m i n a t u 3 Zee. shining brassy black. Head with clypeus broadly emarginate, 

 and acutely bidentate, front with a deep transverse line : antennae testaceous, 

 mouth reddish. Thorax not wider than long, subquadrate ovate, sides not con- 

 verging much in front, convex, anterior transverse impression feeble, dorsal line 

 entire, fine. Elytra not Avider than the thorax, twice as long as their width, 

 cylindrical: striae commencing behind the anterior declivity of the base, strong- 

 ly but distantly punctured nearly to the middle, the inner ones are then deep 

 and impunctured nearly to the tip, where they are less deep, but at the extreme 

 tip are again deeply impressed as in many other species : the interstices are 

 convex, the third not punctured : the outer strife are less deep, and the eighth 

 is almost eflfaced : the marginal ceases at the humerus. The abdomen is rufo- 

 testaceous, paler towards the tip : the legs are testaceous, the anterior tibiae are 

 armed externally with two teeth, the upper very small, the lower acute and 

 prominent: th*e terminal tooth is long and slightly curved, the inferior spur is 

 not longer than the tooth, but is more curved.

New York and Pennsylvania. More stout than D. terminatus andfili- 

 f or mis, but more elongate than usual. Blackish brassy, shining: head smooth 

 with deep frontal impressions connected between the antennae by a deep trans- 

 verse line : clypeus broadly emarginate, with the angles prominent, but not very 

 acute. Antennae reddish testaceous. Thorax slightly broader than long, nar- 

 rowed in front, subtrapezoidal, very much rounded behind, and convex, dorsal 

 line and anterior transverse impression well marked. Elytra hardly wider than 

 the thorax, about twice as long as the width, cylindrical, convex: striae seven 

 upon each, which are tolerably deep towards the base, but very fine and almost 

 obliterated at the apex : the punctures are large and extend to about the middle : 

 the marginal stria ceases at the shoulder, and the four interior strise do not 

 reach the declivity of the base. The under surface is black, and the legs are 

 ferruginous : the anterior tibiis are armed externally with a strong tooth near the 

 apex, the upper denticle is obsolete, the apical tooth is long and curved : the 

 interior apical spur is still longer and more curved.

One specimen from Louisiana given me by Dr. Schaum. In the proportions 

 of the body, and sculpture of the elytra this species resembles D. haemor- 

 r h o i d a 1 i s, but the other characters are very different. The upper denticle 

 of the anterior tibias is very small, the lower one is acute and prominent, the 

 terminal tooth is long and curved, but the inferior spur is yet longer and more 

 curved. The strife of the elytra do not extend upon the anterior declivity ; they 

 are very strongly punctured to the middle, and then become gradually obliter- 

 ated to the tip, when the first, second and seventh are slightly impressed : the 

 eighth stria is obliterated and the marginal ceases at the humerus : the inter- 

 stices are convex, and the third are without punctures. 



27. D. setosu s, feneo-niger, nitidus, clypeo emarginato, bidentato, fronte

The rows of large punctures on the elyti;a, which represent the striae cease be- 

 hind the middle, and at the tip only the extremity of the seventh stria is exa- 

 rate : the rows of small interstitial punctures are four and extend nearly to 

 the tip: each of them supports a long erect black hair, as in Bembidium 

 1 ae y ig a t u m, and other long hairs are seen at the margin of the thorax. 

 The anterior tibiae have a scarcely distinct superior denticle, and an acute in- 

 ferior tooth : the apical tooth is long and slightly curved, the spur is nearly as 

 long and curved.

New Orleans, Dr. Schaum. Allied to the preceding, but larger and less 

 robust; the thorax is different in form and not at all transverse: the striae of 

 the elytra are impressed, and the inner ones may be traced to the very tip : the 

 outer ones are obliterated, the eighth is entirely wanting : the marginal ceases 

 at the humerus : the seventh is exarate at the tip as in the preceding. The 

 anterior tibiae are as in the preceding. A few long hairs are seen at the margin 

 of the head and thorax, as in D. s e t o s u s.

 anterior ^tibiae are not longitudinally impressed, I have retained them in the

NANNOPHYA Rambur. 



N. be 11 a. Black, pleura and sides marked with yellow; ■wings with a saturate 

 pale-ferruginous spot at base enclosing a number of round dots of a darker 

 color. 



Length I inch. Baltimore. June. 



9 • Trophi blackish, front white with a large black spot upon the middle, 

 vertex blue, eyes brown, antenucO black : thorax black with a j-^ellow vittaupon 

 the pleura becoming posteriorly confluent with patches of the same color, inter- 

 alary surface maculate with yellow : wings hyaline, a broad, saturate yellowish- 

 ferruginous spot at base occupying about one-third of their surface and enclosing 

 a number of small round dots of a deeper color; pterostigma small, black : legs 

 black, spiny : abdomen black ^nnulated with yellow, caudal tip and appendages 

 also yellow. 



This beautiful little species, the second only of the genus yet known, differs 

 a little from the type and must be placed in a division which may be charac- 

 terized by having two ranges of discoidal areolets. It is very rare and the 

 male is yet unknown to me. 



LIBELLULA Lin. 



1. L. b i s t i g m a. Lead-blue ; wings with a ferruginous tint upon the costal 

 margin, stigma brown and white. 



Length 2 inches. Baltimore. June and July. 



% . Body entirely lead blue ; eyes brown, trophi dusky ; frontal and vertical 

 vesicles dark blue, antennae black, stemmata brownish: thorax medially with 

 a deep longitudinal depression, a sharp carina occupying the middle : wings 

 lacteo-hyaline, costal margins slightly tinged with ferruginous, sometimes 

 extending narrowly upon the tips, stigma bicolored, half brown and half white, 

 membranes narrow, whitish : legs black, anterior ones dusky at base : abdomen 

 trigonal, carinate, tapering towards the tip, cerci subfusiform, sub-acute. 



The female of this species I have not yet been able to discover, notwithstand- 

 ing it is here very common ; I was tempted to suppose it to be a geographical 

 variety of the species following: however as I have not yet heard that doctrine 

 fully elucidated it seems hardly prudent for me to venture any further sugges- 

 tions upon the subject. 



2. L. p 1 u m b e a. Lead color ; pleura with two white spots ; wings with a tinge 

 of ferruginous upon the costal margin. 



Length 2 inches. Baltimore. July. 



% . Body plumbeous : labium, base of mandibles, and sides of nasus and 

 front white ; mandibles at tip, labrum, nasus, front and antennae black ; frontal 

 and vertical vesicles dark blue, eyes brown, occiput with two yellow spots be- 

 hind each eye : pleura each with two common white patches, which are divided 

 by black sutures, dorsolum and metapnystega also white, dorsal middle longitu- 

 dinally depressed, but slightly carinated : wings hyaline with a ferruginous 

 tinge upon the costal margin, stigma long, brown : abdomen gradually tapering 

 posteriorly, carinate, iirst and second segments white beneath, caudal segment 

 and appendages black, cerci fusiform, sub-acute. 



$ . Body pale brown ; head, dorsal line, line between the wings, pleural 

 spots, pectus, sides of tergum and femora, testaceous-yellow; eyes brown, an- 

 tennae black : costal margins and tips of the wings ferruginous : abdomen sub- 

 depressed, tergum with a gradually dilating brown line upon the middle, 

 antepenultimate segment broadly dilated. 



3. L. confusa. Fuscous; thorax with two oblique yellow lines upon the 

 pleura, connected with each of which is a pale trigonal spot; wings with a 

 brown basal line, and medial and apical spot. 



Length 1| iuQhes. Baltimore and Boston.

5 . Fuscous : head, with the frontal vesicles above, labium and spots upon 

 the occiput yellow, antennae and connecting line black, eyes brown : pleura 

 with two oblique yellow lines bounding inferiorly a trigonal pale spot, a pale 

 transverse line between the pairs of wings : wings hyaline, at the base a 

 longitudinal line, a spot upon the anterior middle, and another upon the apex, 

 brown, nervules of the spots and intervening surface yellow, pterostigma black : 

 legs pale at base, black upon the tip of the femora and tibiae : abdomen brown- 

 ish, a little depressed, antepenultimate segment a little dilated, a dark line upon 

 the middle, and one each side bright yellow, venter lined with yellow each 

 side, cerci short, subfusiform, acute, inferior appendage same length as cerci. 



5 . Differs but little from the 9 in size and coloring ; it may be distinguish- 

 ed from L. pulchella, Drury, — to which it is very closely allied — in the lateral 

 yellow vitta and much larger size of the § : the male always wants the plum- 

 beous abdomen, which is common to L. pulchella. 



4. L. s a t u r a t a. Reddish yellow ; head ; thorax dark yellowish-red, pale 



beneath and upon the sides ; wings humeral portion saturate reddish-yellow, 

 cubital portion hyaline, nervules red, pterostigma red, margined anteriorly and 

 posteriorly by a black nervule ; legs rufous, pale at base, tibial spines black ; 

 abdomen slightly dilated, carinate, trigonate, lateral edge and denticles black ; 

 cerci subfusiform, acuminate, armed with a row of minute tubercles upon the 

 inferior surface, inferior caudal appendage oval, tapering at tip and emarginate. 



Length 2 inches. San Diego trip. Dr. T. H. Webb. 



This species is indicated by a mutilated individual only; the head and a great 

 part of the wings and legs are gone, and those parts remaining are in so bad a 

 condition as to render it almost uncharacterizable. It apparently belongs to a 

 group having five rows of discoidal areolets ; the triangle is crossed by four 

 nervules. 



5. L. J u 11 a. Fuscous, pubescent; eyes brown, darker below, tips of mandi- 

 bles, line between the antenntB, antennae and pubescence upon the front black, 

 front and occipital spots yellowish ; thorax with the superior, middle-surface and 

 pleura pale fuscous, humerus with a dark-brown longitudinal line; wings hyaline, 

 posterior pair with a trigonal dark-brown spot at base of each, necks of anterior 

 pair tinged with brown, nervules and pterostigma dark-brown, the latter narrow 

 and a little elongated, membranes narrow whitish ; legs with the coxae, tro- 

 chanters and bases of femorae pale reddish-yellow, tibiae and tarsi blackish ; 

 abdomen sub-depressed, slightly carinate above, line upon the middle of the 

 posterior segments and lateral margin black, caudal appendages yellow, cerci 

 short, subfusiform, minutely, serially, granulate beneath. 



Length 1^ inches. Fort Steilacoom, W. Territory. Dr. Suckley. 

 A species very closely allied to L. trimaculata De Geer. It possesses three 

 ranges of discoidal areolets, and the triangle is crossed by only one nervule. 



6. L. as s i m i 1 a ta. Pale-yellow ; head yellowish-testaceous, a black line cov- 

 ering the antennal suture, tips of mandibles and antennae black, front and vertex 

 closely covered with blackish hair ; thorax densely pubescent, pectus pale-tes- 

 taceous ; wings hyaline, tinted with yellow upon the base and humeral margin, 

 costal nervule dotted with minute, black points, pterostigma yellow, margined 

 anteriorly and posteriorly, by a black nervule ; legs black, coxa;, trochanters 

 and inferior surface of the anterior legs, yellowish ; abdomen, almost transpa- 

 rent, yellowish, cerci . 



Length 1^ inches. Fort Union, Nebraska. Dr. Suckley 



The three individuals, the only ones that I have had the opportunity of ex- 

 amining, are in such a mutilated condition as to render it very difficult to 

 characterize them properly ; enough, however, remains to indicate their distinct- 

 ness from all the other species that have yet been noticed. 



They liave three ranges of discoidal areolets to the primary wings, and the 

 triangle is crossed by a single nervule. 



The three foregoing insects were kindly placed in my hands by Dr. Chas. 

 GLrard, to whom I would embrace this opportunity of returning my thanks.

Merycodus, Tilanotherium, Leptochcerus, Hyracodon, Merychippus, Ischyromys, Pa- 

 loeolayus, Eumys, Deiniclis, and Leptarctus are peculiar, extinct, mammalian genera, 

 from the tertiary formations of Nebraska, -wliicb have heretofore been generally 

 viewed as belonging to the eocene period, but which from their affinities, 

 from the associated genera, and the absence of others so common in the 

 eocene deposits of Europe, I suspect rather to belong to the miocene period. 

 The first seven genera, above mentioned, are true ruminants, with the teeth con- 

 structed upon the same type as those of living ruminants ; — a type which is not 

 found in the tertiary deposits of Europe and Asia earlier than the miocene 

 period. 



EtUdodon, Paloeochcerus, Rhinoceros, Eipparion, Sieneofiber, AmpMcyon, and 

 Machairodus, are common to the Nebraska tertiary deposits and to the miocene 

 and later tertiary deposits of Europe ; and they have not been found in the 

 eocene formations of the latter continent. 



Of the genera Anchitherium, Hyopolamus, and Ilycenodon, species are found 

 common to the Nebraska tertiary deposits and the European eocene and miocene 

 deposits. 



Remains of Palceotherium, Anoplotherium, and Lophiodon, so common in the 

 eocene formations of Europe, are entirely absent from the Nebraska tertiary 

 formations. 



Titanoiherium of Nebraska most nearly approaches the miocene Chalicotherium 

 of Europe and Asia. 



The Nebraska rodents Ischyromys, PalcBolagus, and Eumys most closely ap- 

 proach the Arctomys, Lepus, and J/ms of European miocene and later deposits. 



Very numerous remains of Testudo are found in association with the Nebraska 

 tertiary mammals ; and extinct species of the same genus belong generally to 

 the miocene and later deposits of Europe. 



The remains of Mastodon and Camelops mentioned in the the list, I suspect to 

 belong to the post pliocene age of the upper Missouri country. 



Ischyr other ium appears to be an animal allied to the llanatus. Its remains are 

 stated by Dr. Hayden to have been obtained from a lignite bed (miocene*) near 

 Moreau and Grand rivers ; but I must leave it to this indefatigable explorer to 

 determine whether it belongs to the same age as the numerous extinct terres- 

 trial mammals of Nebraska. 



Thespcsius I suspect to be a huge dinosaurian. Its remains are stated to be- 

 long to the lowest member of the lignite formations (miocene) of Grand River. 



The species of Clupea was discovered by Dr. John Evans, in a tertiary deposit 

 on Green River, Missouri ; but the exact age of this formation I have no 

 means of determining. 



Investigation on the Rock Guano from the Islands of the Caribbean Sea. 



BY WM. J. TAYLOR. 



Though much has been written and published on the Columbian Guano of 

 the Caribbean Sea, which is also termed Phosphatic Guano, native Super- 

 Phosphate of Lime, &c., I have considered the subject not entirely exhausted, 

 and have for some time past been paying especial attention to its composition, 

 and have also endeavored to gather all possible information regarding its occur- 

 rence. To Dr. D. Luther, President of the Philadelphia Guano Company, I am 

 particularly indebted, for his kindness in furnishing me with material for the 

 investigation from the various groups of islands, and for information regarding

its occurrence. To Dr. F. A. Genth I am also indebted for allowing me to make 

 the investigation in his laboratory. The Guano rock is found on Islands N. E. 

 and N. of the coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea, and belonging to that 

 Republic ; the islands form groups or keys composed of one hundred or more 

 small islands, inhabited principally and indeed almost solely, by water fowl, 

 who resort there in immense numbers for laying their eggs. Mr. Cassin informs 

 me that the birds are those commonly known as Gulls, Pelicans, and Cormo- 

 rants ; these have been the instruments by which the immense deposits of 

 Guano have been formed. But what the process has been is a problem not yet 

 fully solved. 



The Columbian Guano is a hard rock, consisting of two distinct portions : 

 the outer exterior crust, consisting of a white, frequently reniform coat- 

 ing, which in places where it is not decomposed has a polished surface 

 not unlike enamel ; it is composed of concentric layers, each of which 

 is about two or more lines in thickness. The entire outer crust forms but 

 a very small proportion of the whole rock ; a carefully selected portion of this 

 has been analyzed, which had not undergone any apparent decomposition, and 

 upon which the enamelled surface was well preserved. In some portions the 

 reniform surface is distinctly marked, and it resembles to a certain extent in its 

 appearance the menilite from Menil Montant near Paris ; the concentric layers 

 composing it are well marked, and when they are fractured or cut across, an 

 appearance is presented not unlike some varieties of agate. 



The following is the result of analysis : — 



(I)- 



From the oxygen ratio of this it appears that the Phosphoric Acid and Lime 

 exist in the proportion of SCaOPOs. The crucible after ignition showed indi- 

 cations that Chloride of Iron had been volatilized. 



Below this exterior crust the rock has a varied appearance ; it is of a dark 

 brown color, in places quite black, varying in others to a lighter shade, in 

 which portion are frequent cavities filled with minute crystals of gypsum, 

 readily recognizable with a pocket lens. The darkest portion is the most solid, 

 with a slightly vitreous lustre, and of a much greater tensibility and hardness 

 than any other portion of the guano ; it has a sub-concoidal fracture, sometimes 

 splitting into thin fragments, which are translucent, through some portions of it 

 1 have observed frequently, thin irregular bands, l-32d to l-16th of an inch 

 in width, which has the appearance of carbon. 



This portion was selected for analysis with particular care, with the view to 

 ascertain its exact composition; it was with difficulty reduced to the finest pow- 

 der and treated with distilled water (in the cold) in a beaker glass, being fre-

i\uently stirred for several days in order that the water should be in frequent

 with cold water until the filtrate showed no trace of Sulphuric Acid ; the excess 

 of filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and a thorough analysis made of it, the 

 result of which is the following; : — 



There was in this analysis a loss of Lime or Magnesia, also, of the insoluble 

 residue. 



Selections were made from other specimens which resembled very nearly that 

 above described, it was treated in the same manner as (II.), but the results 

 show a marked difference, there being a smaller percentage of Phosphate of 

 Lime dissolved from (11.) than from (III.) and ajiroportional amount of Chloride 

 of Sodium. To this fact I shall again refer. 



The following is the result of analysis :

The specimens from which the material for the above analyses were se- 

 lected, I received from Messrs. Richards & Miller, agents for the Philadelphia 

 Guano Company; there is doubt as to their exact locality; in appearance they 

 correspond exactly with that from Monk's Island, but the results of the analyses 

 are very different from those obtained from the specimens from this Island which I 

 received from Dr. Luther. 



That Alumina is present as a phosphate, in the Guano from Monk's Island, I 

 have proved, by treating 3.4023 grammes of an average sample of the cargo of 

 Schr. Trident from Monk's Island, with pure Caustic Potash in a silver dish, 

 and was found to contain 1.32 per cent, of Alumina. 



Specimens were given me from Monk's Island by Dr. Luther, the character- 

 istic appearance of which has already been described. 



1.5915 grammes were treated in a silver dish with Potash, but not a trace of 

 Alumina could be detected ; the residue dissolved in Hydrochloric Acid was 

 found to contain Lime, 39.08 per cent. 



The guano rock from Monk's Island when finely powdered and treated with 

 distilled water, gave an acid reaction with litmus paper.

Guano Rock has been brought from another group of islands called Centinella, 

 consisting of peaks, which sometimes attain a height of 800 ft. The rock is 

 described as consisting of two layers, the upper of which is a dark-brown com- 

 pact rock, varying slightly from the lower layer. This so called lower layer

has certain!}' a surface exposed, as the specimen which I have examined, has 

 been much weathered; the outer portion is partially reniform, which in places 

 shows a slight enamel, though not near as distinct as on the specimens from 

 Monk's and El Roque islands. It has evidently been formed in layers, which 

 when broken across show a slightly banded appearance not unlike that already 

 described as characteristic of portions of the rock from Monk's Island ; the 

 color varies from a buff to an ochrcous brown ; it is hard, brittle and much more 

 readily pulverized than the Monk's Islands guano rock. An opinion may seem 

 premature, but I am inclined to the belief that this has once been as the guano 

 rock from Monk's Island, which has undergone changes from causes not yet fully 

 studied, which seems ihore probable from the fact that small quantities of Phos- 

 phate of Alumina have been found in the Monk's Island rock. 



The whitest portion of the rock was selected for analysis, which gave the

The 0.65 of Oxygen of the Sulphuric Acid requires 0.22 of the Oxygen of the 

 Lime, the remaining lime is most likely combined with Carbonic Acid, as nearly 

 every specimen on treating with dilute acid gave a slight effervescence, (the guano 

 rock from the vertical cliff contained nearly one per cent.), or possibly a rem- 

 nant of the once phosphate of lime still exists. The alumina and phospho- 

 ric acid exist most likely in the form of Wavellite which has the formula 

 3AI2 O3 , 2PO54-I2HO. It is diflScult in a rock which is in progress of decompo- 

 sition to obtain other than approximate formulae. 



This island of Centinella is now inhabited by immense numbers of water- 

 fowl, many of which roost on the cliffs ; some of these roosts have been long oc- 

 cupied, and judging from the signs on the rocks beneath, have been much resorted 

 to. Mr. Richards of this city, who visited the islands a short time since broke 

 off a portion of the concretion which cover the cliffs beneath a bird roost of this 

 description ; the organic properties had mostly been removed by causes which 

 had converted the inorganic constituents into a guano rock, which in its com- 

 position, is not unlike that from Monk's Island and El Roque. Mr. Richards 

 mentioned that when first obtained it had quite a strong odor, which has now 

 almost disappeared ; it is very hard and was difficult to powder. 



The analysis of the concretion is as follows :

Mr. Richards brought with him also a specimen of the recent alluvial guano, 

 or bird excrement, as it may be justly termed ; he obtained it from a little nook 

 in the rocks, where it was protected from the intense dry heat of the sun and from 

 the action of water. Mixed through it were several birds feathers. As may

A guano rock has recently been brought from a group of Islands called El 

 Roque, in the Caribbean Sea. In composition it resembles very closely that 

 brought from Monk's Island, the specimens that I have analysed, contain how- 

 ever, a much larger quantity of sulphuric acid than has been found in the 

 latter rock. The appearance of the body of the two rocks is also much alike, 

 bat in the specimens which I have seen from EI Roque the exterior ( rust is very 

 different ; it is rarely more than a slight coating ; in some places it has a slight 

 , appearance of the enamel, when examined with a pocket lens; the surface is 

 very irregular, often containing cavities which are lined with the same white 

 coating. It was impossible to obtain sufEcient of this for analysis : the analy- 

 sis of the black portion of the rock was as follows :

 of 3CaO PO5. 



A specimen containing no organic matter was examined from Testigoe Island, 

 but the rock was very much disintegrated ; it was very porous, and evidently 

 had been acted upon by some causes which were gradually removing all its com- 

 ponents except the silica. In appearance it was largely a sandstone, as the analy- 

 sis showed. The most compact portion of the specimen was selected, which was

The Alumina and Phosphoric Acid seem in this to be in the form of wavellite. 

 The guano rock from the various groups of islands has very varying compo- 

 eition, as has been seen from the foregoing investigations ; it is found in layers, 

 and the surface sometimes covered with an alluvial deposit ; these layers are in 

 places highly inclined, showing that since their deposition dynamic causes have' 

 altered their original position. This same phenomenon is described as occurring 

 at the Chincha islands in the Peruvian guano, where it is found in layers two or 

 three yards in thickness. Various theories have been formed and published as 

 to the origin of the rock guano ; these are doubtless premature, as the accounts 

 as to its occurrence are founded on reports of those not accustomed to noting 

 geological phenomenon. 



Prof. C. IJ. Shepard has, with his characteristic energy, extended his mine- 

 ralogical species to various portions of this rock, which he severally describes* 

 and designates generally as Pyroguanite minerals, and entirely destitute of am- 

 monia ; but examinations made of an average sample of a cargo from Monk's 

 Island showed one-half per cent, of nitrogen. Every specimen which I have 

 examined, has on ignition given very marked evidence of burning organic matter. 

 How this can be retained in a rock subjected to the agency of heated trap is as difiB- 

 cult to reconcile, as that the composition of minerals existing with and forming 

 a part of its mass, as Prof. Shepard describes,* containing water in their 

 composition. Moreover, how can a rock subjected to the agency of heated trap 

 have as its principal basis a salt with the formula 2CaO, HO, PO5 which is the 

 formula ascribed to it by Drs. Piggot and Beckell, of Baltimore, and which 

 seems to be the proper composition of some portions, as shown by analysis of 

 Monk's Island rock (V), though in the analysis of the specimen from El Roque 

 (X) there is obtained the formula, 3CaO PO5. 



As I have already mentioned, this Guano rock from Los Monges has been called 

 a native Super-Phosphate of Lime, but no satisfactory proofs are given as to its 

 meriting such a name ; phosphoric acid being found in solution after the 

 guano is treated with water is no proof that it exists in a free state. Phosphate 

 of Lime, when recently precipitated, is soluble to a slight extent in pure water 

 (R. Phillips, Ann. Phil. 22,188). Berzelius long since discovered Phosphates 

 of Lime and Alumina in the water and deposits of hot springs at Carlsbad. f 

 That Phosphates are insoluble and must be rendered free before becoming effi- 

 cacious as fertilizers is an erroneous though a very prevalent opinion. Accord- 

 ing to BrischofJ Phosphate of Lime must be regarded as present in all water 

 running into the sea ; it has already been detected in the waters of the Dee and 

 and of the Don, and it will most likely be found in the waters of all rivers. Phos- 

 phate of Lime and Magnesia have also been found in the waters of an artesian well 

 at Wildegg, in the Canton Argan (Switzerland). Phosphote of Lime has been 

 shown to be present in sea water by Clemm^ and by Forchammer.|| According 

 to Berzelius it is the Z>i-phosphate which is found in the mineral waters,^ which 

 is readily soluble in water saturated with carbonic acid. The Basic-Phosphate 

 of Lime is also readily soluble in water containing carbonic acid ; Bischof gives

a very interesting table of the degrees of solubility of the various basic-Phos- 

 phates of Lime iu water saturated with carbonic acid gas.'-" 



It is not only in carbonic acid waters that Phosphate of Lime is soluble ; 

 basic-Phosphate of Lime dissolves in 3.150 parts of water, containing one-twelfth 

 by weight of Chloride of Sodium. The presence of Chloride of Ammonium in- 

 creases the solubility still more.* 



It is probable, therefore, that the solubility of the Phosphate of Lime Guano 

 rock from Los Monges is owing to the presence of the Chloride of Sodium exist- 

 ing in it. By reference to the analyses (II and III), it will be seen thai the 

 Phosphate of Lime dissolved is in proportion to the Chloride of Sodium in the 

 specimens. This will, however, require more detailed examination. 



Though the rock from Centinella containing so large a percentage of Phos- 

 phoric Acid combined with Iron and Alumina may seem at first worthless as a 

 fertilizer, no positive opinion should be formed or expressed without a very 

 careful investigation of the subject, which I believe has never yet been made. 

 It is true that Phosphate of Alumina is one of the most sparingly soluble sub- 

 stances known, though it is soluble in water saturated with Carbonic Acid, ac- 

 cording to Bischof in about 6.828.000 parts, though in the water of the Carlsbad 

 springs about double this quantity is held in solution, viz : ' t 



3-125000. 



Though the Phosphate of lime is applied to soils, and, as such, taken up by 

 plants, there is no proof that it remains in that form until the plants have need 

 of it; it enters into new combinations, some of which may be quite as insoluble 

 as this Centinella rock. The Phosphate of Lime dissolved by the carbonated 

 waters always found more or less in soils, J is decomposed by alkaline carbonates : 

 the lime would therefore be converted into a carbonate, and a phosphate of the 

 alkali will be formed.^ Bousingault and Levy, Journ. des Debuts, Dec. 5, 1852, 

 found that the air in the insterstices of arable soils contained as much as 22 

 to 23 times as much carbonic acid as the atmosphere, and when the soil has 

 been recently moistened 245 times as much. Phosphate of lime lying in such a 

 soil would be dissolved in a comparatively short space of time. 



Carbonate of Iron is present more or less in every soil, and consequently if in a 

 soil the carbonate of iron and phosphate of lime exist, both held in solution by a 

 carbonate of the alkalies, a mutual decomposition may take place||, consequently 

 we may have vivianite formed in the soil : instances are frequent of vivianite in 

 fossils of the green sand of New Jersey,^ but geological ages are not required 

 to produce these changes. M. Jerome Nickles has recognised its presence in 

 human bones, (Amer. Jour, of Sci. vol. xsi. p. 402.) he found in a cemetery at 



* Chem. and Phys. Geology, vol. ii% p. 28. 



f (Chem and Phys. Geol. vol. ii. p. 34. 



JResearches that have been made by Lassaigne, Journ. Chim. Med. 3 ser. iv. 

 354 ; and Ann. de Chim. et. de Phys. 3 ser. xxv. 346, show that phosphate of 

 lime is conveyed into the plants organism by water saturated with carbonic acid. 

 Dumas (Comptes Rendus, xxiii 1018,) holds the same opinion. 



I Bischof, Chem. and Phys. Geology, vol. i. p. 13. No. 19. Phosphate of lime 

 dissolved in carbonated water forms Carbonate of Lime, which is precipitated, 

 and alkaline phosphate which remain in solution. 



II Phosphate of lime dissolved in carbonated waters and proto-carbonate of 

 iron form a proto-phosphate of iron, which is precipitated, and bi-carbonate of 

 lime which remains in solution. (Bischof vol. i. p. 13, no. 20. 



^In the green sand of New Jersey, the decomposition is not owing probably 

 to the carbonate of iron, but to the sulphate resulting from oxydation of the 

 iron pyrities. (Bischof, vol. i. p. 14, no. 21.) Phosphate of iron and proto-sulph- 

 ate of iron form sulphate of lime and proto-phosphate of iron,) Similar changes 

 probably result in this guano rock, as in many specimens we find crystals of 

 gypsum recognizable with a pocket-lense.

Eumont a village ia the department of LaMeurthe, the earth of which was very 

 ferruginous, two arm bones of a female, a cubitus and a radius, having a deep 

 bluish green color. On breaking, the alteration was found to be complete, and a 

 qualitative chemical examination proved it to be phosphate of iron. It is to be 

 regretted that a quantitative analysis was not made, to have determined whether 

 all the bone phosphate had been decomposed and the transformation into phos- 

 phate of iron complete. M. Nickles, on examining the medullary cavity with a 

 lens, found among the sinuosities left by the hardened marrow brilliant points 

 which were distinctly crystals of vivianite. The bones were in a perfect state 

 of preservation, and afforded, when treated with hydrochloric acid, a skeleton 

 of gelatine, proving that gelatine does not resist the absorption of the ferrugin- 

 ous compound. 



Various theories have been formed and published as to the origin of the rock 

 guano ; these are most likely premature, as the accounts as to its occurrence are 

 founded on reports of those not accustomed to noting geological phenomena. 

 The continued and gradual upheaval of islands in the ocean and their depression 

 is a well established geological fact. 



The islands of the Caribbean sea are very varied, some are quite low and 

 covered with sand composed of fragments of shells, madrepore and corals, 

 which can readily be distinguished with a pocket lens. These sands are resorted 

 to by myriads of waterfowls for laying their eggs. One of the captains who 

 visited there mentions, that it is necessary to make one's way through them 

 with a stick. Other islands attain heights of 800 feet ; it seems improbable 

 that such heights could be created by accretions of guano and sand, when the 

 islands were subject to a continued action of the waves of the ocean. The in- 

 clination and irregularity of the guano layers renders it not improbable that 

 the dynamic causes which produced this distortion, elevated at the same time 

 the islands. 



It is most probable that the guano rock from some of the islands has been 

 changed in its composition by reactions of the salts contained in sea water, but 

 before such reactions can be fully explained, accurate analyses must be made of 

 this sea water. 



It is a remarkable fact, that the composition of the ash from the recent guano 

 from the heights of the Centinellarock composed of phosphates of alumina and 

 iron, should have a composition so very near to that of the guano rock 

 from the Los Monges and El Roque islands. 



The frequent occurrence of alumina and iron is to be remarked in the guano 

 rocks. 



The upheaval and subsidence of land is caused not only by earthquakes, 

 (Lyell's Principles of Geology, 8th edit. chap, xxxi.,) but by other changes such as 

 are in progress in Sweden and Norway, and in Greenland. The upheaval of islands 

 in the Caribbean Sea may most likely be ascribed lo volcanic action, some of 

 these are within 150 miles from Gaudaloupe. (Lyell's Principles, 33G,) von 

 Buch inclined to the belief, that the volcanic chain of the Andes was connected 

 with that of the West India or Caribbean Islands. The truth of this conjecture 

 has been almost set at rest by the eruption of the volcano at Zamba, in New 

 Grenada, at the mouth of the river Madalena.* 



The vicinity of the volcanoes may give additional salts to the sea water. 



Note. — I have just been informed by Dr. Luther, that from analyses lately 

 made in Baltimore of a cargo of rock guano, that has lately arrived from the 

 island of Testigoes, there has been found from forty to forty-five per cent, of 

 phosphoric acid.

Examination of a Nickel Meteorite, from Oktibbeha County, Mississippi. 

 BY WM. J. TAYLOR. 



This highly interesting and unique meteorite was found in an Indian mound 

 in which excavations were being made in a search for Indian antiquities, in 

 Oktibbeha County, Mississippi. It then weighed five and a quarter ounces ; in 

 shape it resembled a hea's egg. When found, there was a fissure which divided 

 it almost equally into two parts. The person who discovered it seeing this, 

 placed it upon an anvil, and with one blow of a sledge-hammer, divided the 

 meteorite. One half was forged, with the intention of manufacturing it into a 

 cutting instrument of some description ; the other remained in its original state; 

 excepting that its exterior was filed smooth and bright. 



To Dr. William Spillman, of Columbus, Mississippi, I am indebted for 

 the material for this investigation ; he obtained the meteorite from the man 

 who first found it. The unforged half he brought with him on a recent visit to 

 this city, and a portion of which he has presented to the Academy, on the con- 

 dition that it should be carefully cut, so that the surface which formed one side 

 of the existing fissure above mentioned should be preserved and sent to him. It 

 was proposed to have it cut by a lapidary, but he attempted it without success, 

 usin"" diamond dust on the wheel. On making the first incision, about one- 

 eighth to one-sixteenth of an inch in depth, he found it impossible to proceed, 

 and refused to make farther attempts to cut the meteorite. Mr. John Phillips, 

 a fellow member of the Academy, and an amateur machinist, on hearing of our 

 difficulties, kindly offered to saw the specimen, and succeeded admirably, though 

 it was with very great difticulty. He spoke of its peculiar toughness, (the hard- 



[April,

ness not bcinr^ excessive ;) it resisted the saw very miuli, wliich rendered the 

 rutting exceedingly tedious, heating the saw to such a degree as to oblige a 

 discontinuance of the operation every four or five minutes, but it was remarka- 

 ble that it did not dull the blade in the least. 



The toughness of the iron was clearly shown when, for the purpose of analy- 

 sis, it was attempted to cut off portions of it with a chisel ; the excessive tough- 

 ness of the iron rendered this very difficult, without the aid of the saw. The 

 resistance of this meteorite to the action of acids was most remarkable. Strong 

 nitric acid did not act upon it in the cold. Moderately dilute sulphuric acid did 

 not act upon it. Strong and boiling hydrochloric acid acted upon it very gradu- 

 ally. 



The above named acids failing to show the slightest trace of the Widmann- 

 stattian figures, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric was used, boiling ; but 

 even after this operation no trace of them could be distinguished. The action 

 of the aqua regia was gradual and peculiar, producing on the polished surface 

 of the meteorite very small holes, varying in size from a pin's point to those as 

 large as a pin's head. From the appearance of the surface of the meteorite, 

 which formed a side of the fissure before described, I hud hoped to obtain by 

 etching beautiful Wi^'mannstilttian figures, as there is on this portion indistinct 

 traces of that which would at first glance be called a crystalline structure. 



The color of the metal is a silvery grey with a pinkish tinge. Its hardness is 

 not excessive, yielding readily to the file. The tensibility, as before mentioned, 

 was very great. The passivity was proved by testing it with a neutral solution 

 of the sulphate of copper. 



The specific gravity at 25° Cels., was found by Dr. F. A. Genth to be 6.854, 

 which is too low, but owing to the numerous fissures through the meteorite 

 filled with liraonite, it was impossible to obtain the exact specific gravity of the 

 metal. I used particular care to obtain a portion free from the flaws, but with- 

 out effect. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to Dr. Genth for allow- 

 ing me the use of his laboratory in making the examination. The following is 

 the re? ult of my analysis : 



1.9421 grammes were dissolved in aqua regia. 



99.19 



The slight loss of eight- tenths of one per cent. I think is owing to some small 

 portions of limonite existing in the minute fissures already mentioned. 



The 0.10 per cent, of phosphorus correspond to 0.64 per cent, of schribersite, 

 (P. Ni2 Fe4 .) 



It was first attempted to dissolve in hydrochloric acid, but the action of the 

 acid, even when boiling, was so very gradual that nitric acid was added. 



I endeavored to separate the nickel and cobalt by Liebig's new method, viz., 

 by precipitating the nickel as a sesqui-oxide, by passing chlorine through an 

 alkaline solution of the two metals in hydrocyanic acid and potash, but it was 

 found not to answer ; the separation was made by his former method by oxide 

 of mercury. 



The composition of this remarkable meteorite is in itself sufficiently interest- 

 ing for mineralogists, without any attempts to account for its origin, either ter- 

 restrial or celestial. We must remain in doubt as to the exact locality where 

 it was originally found, as it may have been carried by the Indians from a dis- 

 tance to be entombed in this mound, and it may have been considered by them

Communications were received from Col. J. J. Abert, dated Wash-

 by him to be new ; and from F. B. Meek and F. V. Hayden, M. D., 

 entitled '' Explorations under the War Department : Descriptions of 

 new Cretaceous and Tertiary Fossils, collected by Dr. F. V. Haydea 

 in Nebraska, under the direction of Lieut. Gr. K. Warren, U. S. Top. 

 Engineers, with some remarks on the geology of the Upper Missouri 

 country;" which were referred to Committees, as usual. 



Mr. Lea stated that he proposed to change the name of Unio um- 

 brosus and Unio W^heatleyi, to U. umbrans and U. Catawbensis, having 

 inadvertently repeated these names in his papers of Feb. 17th and 

 March 10th, 1857. 



Mr. W. Parker Foulke requested permission to submit to the atten- 

 tion of the Academy some observations of the late Mr. Hugh Miller, 

 printed in his recently published work, entitled " The Testimony of 

 the Rocks." 



It may be remembered, said Mr. F., that about three years ago T noticed at 

 one of the stated meetings of the Academy, what appeared to me an interesting 

 example of the fallacious use of a generalization — the inference from a term 

 used in one sense, of what could follow from it only when used in another sense. 

 From the fact that the carboniferous rocks lie within the series which geologists, 

 for special reasons, group into one system which they call the " palaeozoic," Mr. 

 Miller had thought himself authorized so far to treat this system as a unity, as 

 to consider it properly characterized as a whole, for the object of his argument, 

 by the carboniferous member ; and thence to infer that the palaeozoic periods 

 together constituted the Mosaic day during which the creation of vegetables 

 took place. No influence had been allowed to the fact that distinctive types of 

 animal organization had been the chief motives for the discrimination between 

 the "palaeozoic "' and "secondary" rocks as two sj^stems ; but the distinction 

 being thus adopted by others, the author had assigned one of the systems entire 

 to the vegetable creation, and the other to that of reptiles. 



You will remember, Mr. President that, before the time to which I refer, it 

 was a subject of private remark amongst the members of the Academy, 

 that a large portion of the zeal and talent employed in drawing conclusions 

 from the generalizations of discoveries in natural science, was applied to prema- 

 ture inferences, or in disproportionate subordination to incomplete metaphysical 

 inquiries. This evil was not confined to men of one pursuit, or of one school : 

 but it affected eveiy department of " natural science," and of the abstract sciences 

 most nearly connected with it. In geology, as well as in ethnology, philojogy, 

 and general natural history, we had frequent occasion to notice the conflict of 

 unnecessary speculations, and of irrelevant or unseasonable inferences ; and the 

 temporary withdrawal of much mental activity from the legitimate paths of 

 scientific inquiry. The interval is short since the investigations of our day were 

 fairly opened ; and already the necessary subdivisions of labor are so numerous 

 as to demand the most sedulous devotion to each. Yet we saw laborer after 

 laborer diverging from his road to engage upon one or another side of meta- 

 physical controversies, which could not be finally determined except by methods 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



proper to the natural sciences ; nor even by these, unless after greater accumu- 

 lation and more accurate generalization of facts than had been accomplished. 

 In the eagerness excited by these controversies, xve also noticed, especially in 

 respect to such as were of a kind to attract popular attention, that there was 

 caused a bias unfavorable to the ascertainment of fact ; and that tlie legitimate 

 uses of actual discovery were thwarted by irregular processes, wliich for the 

 most part were unconsciously adopted, but which were not for tliis reason the 

 less pernicious to the progress of natural knowledge. In these circumstances, 

 the rationale of the methods employed by writers upon natural history or the 

 physical sciences in general, became a peculiarly important subject for the 

 scrutiny of the Academy ; and in formally presenting that subject, I felt assured 

 that my propositions would serve only as the means of concentrating thoughts 

 alreadj" entertained by the members. To give a suitable illustration of the irre- 

 gularity iu question, there were several reasons for selecting the discourse of 

 Mr. Miller, entitled " The Two Records, the Mosaic and the Geological." It had 

 jast been republished in this country; its author was widely known in both 

 hemispheres by his interesting discoveries in the old red sandstone ; and, because 

 of his having written so as to be easily understood by persons not previously 

 skilled in geology, his publications bad been read by probably a larger number 

 of persons than had before undertaken the perusal of treatises on the sarac sub- 

 ject. Moreover, he had written with special reference to several leading con- 

 troversies which engaged the popular attention ; and his works were frequently 

 appealed to with more or less pertinency in relation to the Noachic deluge, the 

 origin of the varieties in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and the geo- 

 graphical distribution of species. He thus served as a medium of communica- 

 tion between the studies of scientific men, and the speculations of the general 

 reader. Lastly, his character and motives were unimpeached ; and thus the 

 force of personal considerations was added to those of learning and judgment. 

 I was careful, Mr. President, to announce at the outset, that what was intended 

 in my criticism had reference to the " logic of the natural sciences ;" but under 

 the comity proper between this Academy and the cultivators of those sciences 

 throughout the world, it certainly did not appear to me necessary to disclaim 

 all design to charge upon any person a wilful misuse of reasoning. Neverthe- 

 less, as a manifestation of the feeding with which the essay of Jlr. Miller was 

 reviewed, I used these words, which were printed in our Proceedings : "The 

 high esteem in which the character of Mr. Miller is deservedly held by readers 

 in the United States, where his writings are widely circulated, and the respectful 

 manner in which his interesting researches have occasioned his name to be 

 mentioned by authors eminent in the department of geology, give to such of his 

 writings as bear upon the biblical question, peculiar importance with reference 

 to the community at large." There was, therefore, no question proposed upon 

 matter of fact, nor any imputation upon the motives of Mr. Miller. My remarks 

 obtained the general concurrence of the members who heard them ; at whose 

 instance, and not at my own, the minute of them made by the Secretary was 

 published with the other proceedings of the evening. 



Sharing with you, Mr. President, and our fellow members, the profound senti- 

 ment produced in this country by the melancholy scenes which closed the use- 

 ful life of Mr. Miller, I am sure of your participation with me in the surprise 

 and regret with which I have read the following paragraphs, at pages 171, 172 

 and 173* of "The Testimony of the Rocks." (Mr. Foulke here read the pas- 

 sages referred to.) 



That a member of this Academy could be permitted to make, against such a 

 man as the lamented deceased, a gratuitous charge of intentional misreprcsenta- 

 /«ow ; and that the charge could be deliberately sanctioned, and printed under 

 your authority and that of the other distinguished gentlemen who were present 

 at the meeting of May 9, 1854 — some of whom are now here — seems so far beyond 

 any license known to a respectable association, that I confess myself at a loss

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



to find aa acceptable explanation of the credence which has been given to the 

 supposition. I need not say, in this Hall, that the thing is impossible. Mr. 

 Miller is no longer among the living ; the hand of death has removed restraints 

 ■which might have prevented the voluntary proffer of any denial of such an imputa- 

 tion as is implied upon me, upon you, and upon our associates, by the paragraphs 

 which I have read to you. I shall have your and their approval, when I give 

 to the memory of the deceased, as a tribute of respect, the most emphatic dis- 

 claimer of any thought which could impeach the integrity of his motives in the 

 construction of his argument; or which could attribute to him conscious neglect 

 of the rights of others, in that most unfortunate interpretation which he has put 

 upon the Proceedings of this body. 



Having said thus much towards the dead, let me add a few words in the way 

 of caution to ourselves. Each of us is engaged in some pursuit which touches 

 adversely the opinions, the prejudices, the self-love, perhaps the religious senti- 

 ment of a portion of mankind. Even in what might appear to an uuimpassioned 

 observer the most tranquil of occupations, there arise competitions; and the 

 very love of truth often makes us impatient disputants. We have seen that 

 under a sudden sensibility to a logical criticism, not so phrased as expressly to 

 forbid the meaning erroneously attributed to it, a stranger, with no cause of 

 quarr *, has been supposed by an author of respectable fame to make an accusa- 

 tion of mendacity against him ; and a learned body of established reputation 

 has been believed to have promoted the publication of the charge. To a judg- 

 ment thus unconsciously clouded, see how naturally all that followed became 

 distorted. I had said that the proceeding of the author was " a fallacious use 

 of a generalization made for a purpose, and upon a principle not properly availa- 

 ble for the writer's argument ;" and the author forgetting the distinction be- 

 tween &f(tUacii and a falsehood, and overlooking too the grammatical relation of 

 the parts of the sentence, italicized the words " 7nade for apur2}ose" so that his 

 readers could not avoid the suggestion that it was the '■'■fallacious use" and not 

 the " generalization," which had been mac?e /o?* a j9!<rjuose, inapplicable to bis 

 object. Nay more ; such was the effect upon the author's mind, that he closed 

 his quotation with an "&c." at the very point at which began the sentence which 

 I have read to you, referring to the " esteem in which he was deservedly held in 

 the United States" — took no notice whatever of the tenor of that sentence, but 

 said," so far the Proceedings of the Academy," &c. It need not surprise you, sir, 

 after such examples, to find that I am said to treat the carboniferous period as the 

 latest of the palaeozoic series. A glance at my phraseology will be sufficient to 

 show you that the " series" referred to was one reckoned " from the carboniferous 

 rocks downwards, (backward in order of time,)" and that the rocks in this series 

 were selected by me to show the inconsistency of the argument with the facts ; and 

 that my choice had no connection with the limitation of the palaeozoic system. 

 That my use of the word series was not a novelty, may be easily shewn by refer- 

 ence to British as well as American authors.* I have no wish to multiply these 

 observations ; my peculiar personal interestin the misapprehensions of the author, 

 ends with the explanation which has been made in relation to that which wounded 

 his feelings ; yet, in illustration of the reflection to which my last remarks have 

 been directed, it may not be improper to mention two or thi'ee additional ex- 

 amples. Thus, although a member of this body, surrounded by the choice 

 geological library through the use of which so manj^ Americans have become 

 known abroad for learning in natural science, it is assumed that I am igno- 

 rant of the relation of the " Permian " rocks to the Palceozoic system — a relation 



* " The use of the word series in describing the subdivisions of the palaeozoic 

 system, is by no means an innovation, but is, on the contrary, a return to the 

 language formerly in very common use among tlie members of the Geological 

 Society, as any one may see on turning over the pages of the early volumes."

indicated during at least twenty years in elementary treatises. Again, although 

 a citizen of Pennsylvania — a State one of whose most remarkable evidences of 

 wealth is the fact that she is the holder of the great anthracite basin and of n, 

 portion of the chief bituminous measures — although a resident of Philadelphia, 

 whose principal domestic export is coal, it is assumed that 1 could overlook the 

 fact that there are vast deposits of coal in North America. It ought, perhaps, to 

 be said in this connection, that the author has wholly misunderstood my observa- 

 tions with respect to tlie comparative quantities of vegetable product in the car- 

 boniferous period and that in which we live. Considering that we do not know 

 the extent of the area of growth in the carboniferous period, nor the length ot 

 time consumed in forming the deposits of vegetable matter which make the coal 

 beds ; and taking into view solidity as well as size, and the multiplication of indi- 

 vidual growths, it is certainly not going very far to say that it is not " patent to 

 all " that the total quantity of vegetable growth upon the earth during a given 

 space of time was greater in the carboniferous than in the present period. I 

 made no affirmative assertion ; and in the absence of conclusive i^roof, I have 

 none to make now. It is enough to indicate the irrelevance of the reasoning 

 employed by the author upon pages 174 and 1*75. 



With respect to the scientific criticism which has occasioned these remarks, 

 it gives me no concern. It, or its equivalent, will be judged by proper persons. 

 It has been in the handsof many whose minds have been disciplined in the best 

 methods of inquiry ; and from no quarter had I reason to suspect the existence 

 of dissent until the appearance of the book before us. It is to be hoped that 

 on both sides of the Atlantic there will be cultivated a mutaal confidence, which 

 shall prevent misconception of motives ; and that hereafter the vigilance which 

 is indispensable to preserve the pursuits of philosophy from unconscious bias, 

 shall not be misconstrued as the intrusion of an unfriendly spirit. Felix quern 

 faciunt aliena pericida cautum. In conclusion, I beg to renew the expression of 

 my regret, that any accident should have made me the occasion of pain to a 

 gentleman so deserving of our consideration and friendly esteem as was the 

 author of "The Testimony of the Rocks." It cannot but enhance the appro- 

 priateness of such an expression at this meeting, that beside yourself and your 

 colleague, the other Vice President, who usually preside over the deliberations 

 of the Academy, I see here to night its venerable President, and several other 

 learned members, whose names are familiar to cultivators of the natural sciences

 J. J. Audubon and party, in the month of September, 1843, our Mackinaw boat 

 was moored for the night on the right bank of the river, under shelter of timber 

 on the bank, which was here about twenty feet above the water at its then

rather low stage. Our guide and pilot in descending the river, Prevost, who 

 was an old trapper, hired by Mr. A. at St. Louis for the trip, soon discovered 

 signs of the beaver, and presently a newly constructed beaver-house about one 

 hundred yards above the boat. It was too late to examine the premises, and 

 after cutting wood, building a fire, and cooking our supper, we turned in for the 

 night. Very early in the morning, before breakfasting, we hastened to examine 

 what had been the object of more than one expedition on the Yellowstone, and 

 which had, heretofore, baffled our search. Prevost assured us that the noise 

 and smell of smoke, and cooking from our camp, must have driven the beaver 

 to a place of safety soon after our landing the night before, and that we could 

 only gratify our curiosity by the inspection of the building; whereas, had day- 

 light permitted, we might, at first landing, have proceeded quietly and stopped 

 the covered outlet from the house to the water, and thus secured the inmates, 

 and this only by using the utmost caution in approaching without giving them 

 the wind of us, or making the slightest noise, even the crackling of a dry twig 

 under our feet; so religiously did he believe in their superhuman sagacity in 

 discovering and avoiding danger. Thus assured, I took my gun, more from the 

 influence of the habit of- some months of seldom stirring from camp without it, 

 than from any expectation of seeing a beaver. I followed the water to the out- 

 let, while others took the bank; here I stood watching the operations of those 

 above, who had commenced removing the branches of cotton-wood which 

 formed the covering of the domicile. I was startled suddenly by the splashing 

 of the water at my feet, and, looking down, I saw the dusky back of a beaver 

 a few inches under the surface, gliding out into the deep water of the river, and 

 before I could prepare and bring my gun into position, he was out of sight. 

 Nothing could have been easier, had I been prepared, than to have shot him as 

 he thus passed within three feet of the spot on which I stood. Thus, from too 

 much reliance on popular tradition of the unerring instinct of this animal, was 

 I prevented from adding the skin, and description, and measurements of a fresh 

 specimen of the beaver to the trophies of our expedition. As the beaver passed 

 down the stream he was seen to rise for air, abreast of our boat, by some of the 

 men on board. We then proceeded to unroof the house by removing the cotton- 

 wood branches, which covered it for several feet in thickness ; they extended 

 for a considerable width on each side, and covered the passage from the house 

 to the water ; this passage was about fourteen inches square, as neatly excava- 

 ted as a ditcher could have made it with a spade ; it was from twenty-five to 

 thirty feet long, following the scope of the bank, and ending some two or three 

 feet under the water. The branches were laid with their butts uppermost, and 

 formed a complete thatching to the house, nearly weather-proof. The house 

 itself was a vertical excavation into the bank, cylindrical in form and about 

 three and a half feet in diameter ; the slope of the bank, where it was cut, gave 

 it the figure of a section of a cylinder of about four feet high on the side of the 

 bank, and the heighth of the passage to the river, on the other, about fourteen 

 inches. The bottom and walls of this room were smooth and hard as though 

 they had been pressed or beaten, but not plastered. The circle was apparently 

 perfect in form. I should have said, it was rather more than half-way up the 

 bank. Prevost said that the house was unfinished, and that, before winter, the 

 whole interior earth and brush of the sides and roof would have been neatly 

 plastered with clay so as to render it entirely weather-proof. The quantity of 

 cotton-wood branches and saplings used in this structure was enormous; I 

 suspect the measurement would have been about three cords, or as many wagon 

 loads, and so closely impacted that it Wiis only after considerable labor that a 

 breach was made. On the bank above was the area of stump-land where they 

 had felled their timber, taking what was suitable from the most convenient dis- 

 tance. The large block presented this evening was cut from the largest log 

 felled ; the branches only were taken, leaving the trunk where it fell. Small 

 saplings were taken entire. The smaller piece, which is cut at both ends, was 

 the butt of a bough or sapling, which, in their attempt to drag to the bank, had 

 become wedged among a clump of bushes in such a manner that they could not

back it out again, owing to the resistance of tlie branches on the ground and of 

 other bushes, so, like the sailor who throws overboard a portion of iiis cargo to 

 enable him to save the rest, thej' cut oflF this piece that they might steer clear 

 of the difficulty with the remnant of their treasure. The chips are from the 

 larger specimen ; in cutting them out they must work horizontally around the 

 trunk, and when they have cut two grooves at the proper distance apart, they 

 take hold of the isolated portion with their teeth, and split off portions vertically, 

 and so in succession split off chips until they have girdled the tree ; a second 

 course is then removed from the bottom of this, and so on diminishing the size 

 of the chips until the tree is only supported by a portion of its heart connecting 

 the apices of two cones — one on the stump upright, the other on the butt of the 

 log inverted. In this manner, also, the Indians cut down trees with their 

 hatchets, leaving the same form of a cone on the but of the log and on the stump, 

 as their beaver neighbors have done before them.

The facts from which the accompanying map and section have been con- 

 structed, are mainly the results of three years' explorations by me in the north 

 west;* and although some of them have heretofore been given to the public 

 in brief written accounts of the geology of that country,f this is the first time 

 they have been presented in this form. 



In regard to the Map, I would simply state that it is based on the most re- 

 cent topographical explorations. The geology, however, is of course not

colored with that minuteness of detail attainable where a regular geological survey 

 has been made. It is therefore probable outliers of the Tertiary formations may 

 exist at a few points where the color would indicate the presence of the older 

 strata upon which they repose. It may also be the case that in some instan- 

 ces valleys have been excavated through the Tertiary so as to expose the 

 Cretaceous strata, at a few localities near the junction of those systems which 

 I have colored as Tertiary. Where any of the colors end abruptly against 

 black spaces, I merely mean to indicate that the formation is known to extend 

 that far, without pretending to say it may not occupy a greater area in that 

 direction.* 



As meagre as this map may appear, it is hoped it will not be considered 

 void of interest, when it is borne in mind that it represents the geology of 

 a country about much of which comparatively little accurate information has 

 been published, and the most conflicting opinions are entertained. As an 

 evidence of this, it is only necessary to state that in a comparatively recent 

 publication issued under the sanction of the Geological Society of France, 

 the author, with nearly all that had been published respecting the geology 

 of this country before him, colors almost the whole of this area, which 

 is now well known to be occupied by Cretaceous and Tertiary formations, as 

 Triassic and Jurassic. 



Respecting the section, it is perhaps only necessary for me to state, that so 

 far as it represents a profile of the country, it has been constructed from the 

 most reliable Barometrical measurements in the possession of the War Depart- 

 ment. The relative thickness of the various formations is given from careful 

 estimates, and not from actual measurements ; it is believed, however, that they 

 will not be found far from correct. 



As a brief history of former explorations in the North West, together with 

 descriptions of the new fossils, are given in another place in this number of 

 the Proceedings, I shall here confine myself to a few general remarks respect- 

 ing the geological formations represented in the map and section, and leave all 

 details for another occasion. 



The rocks of Nebraska Territory, so far as they have been determined, ap- 

 pear to be referrible to four of the great systems, viz. : — 



I. Carboniferous. III. Tertiary. 



II. Cretaceous. IV. Quaternary. 



That portion of Nebraska to which my attention has been directed, forms 

 the area or basin drained by the upper Missouri river and its tributaries, but 

 more immediately to the region bordering upon the Missouri itself, commenc- 

 ing at the mouth of the Platte river and proceeding thence to a jjoiut near the 

 base of the Rocky Mountains. 



System I. — Carboniferous. 



Ascending the Missouri river, we have the upper members of the Car- 

 boniferous system, or the Coal Measures, very well exposed at the mouth of the 

 Platte, and extending up the river about fifty miles, where they dip beneath the 

 water level of the Missouri. At Florence, seven miles above Omaha city, the 

 bed of the river is formed of these limestones, and this is the last exposure of 

 them which I observed in ascending the river. 



It is difficult to estimate with much accuracy the thickness of the different 

 beds, as the yellow marl or " Bluff Formation," a recent deposit, attains a 

 great thickness in this region, concealing the limestone except in a few lo- 

 calities. 



* By some mistake of the persons employed in New York to color the map, the little 

 Tertiary basin at the mouth of Judith River, and several small outliers of Tertiary near 

 White River, are colored a much deeper yellow than the deposits of that age on other 

 parts of the map. 



A very small exposure of Cretaceous rocks on the Yellowstone, just below the mouth 

 of Power River, was by a similar error left out. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. Ill 



The Coal Measures, when thoroughly studied, will be found to hold an im- 

 portant position among the geological systems of the far West. According to the 

 investigations of Prof Shallow, they extend down the Missouri river to Lexing- 

 ton, and we may safely say that they occupy that portion of Kansas bordering 

 upon the river,'and for a considerable distance into the interior. We have 

 satisfactory evidence of their existence in the vicinity of Fort Laramie, and 

 also that they occupy a considerable area near Great Salt Lake, Utah Terri- 

 tory. 



Little is, however, known of the geology of these for western regions ; our 

 present information consisting for the most part of isolated facts. 



System II. — Cretaceous. 



This system holds a very important position in the North West not only 

 from the vast area which it occupies, but also in consequence of_ the 

 number, variety, and beauty of its organic remains. The different formations, 

 as they appear in ascending the Missouri, hare been separated into five 

 divisions, presenting generally well-marked lithological differences, and for 

 the most part characterized by different species of fossils. I shall first speak 

 of Formation No. 1 of the Vertical Section, presuming, however, that from all 

 the information yet obtained, its geological position is not definitely determined. 

 Thus far the weight of evidence seems to be in favor of its belonging to the 

 Cretaceous System. We will consider it provisionally, therefore, as the lowest 

 member of the Cretaceous System in this region, and as the first of the series of 

 beds of that age seen in ascending the Missouri. 



Formation No. 1 of Vertical Section* 



In the order of superposition, Formation No. 1 rests directly upon the true 

 limestones of the Coal Measures before referred to. Its first exposure seen 

 along the Missouri is at Wood's Bluffs, right bank, about eighty miles above 

 the mouth of the Platte, and it dips beneath the water level of the Missouri, 

 a few miles below the mouth of the Vermilion. Its general character is a 

 coarse grained, friable sandstone, very ferruginous, of a yellow or reddish 

 yellow color, with thin beds of impure lignite aud various colored claj-. It con- 

 tains very few fossils, mostly of the genera Solm, Cyprina and Peclitnculm, also 

 fossil wood, and numerous impressions of dicotyledonous leaves, similar to the 

 common willow. Its entire thickness is estimated at ninety to one hundred 

 feet, but it may be more. The relation which I suppose this formation holds 

 to one of a similar character near the mouth of the Judith river will be noticed 

 hereafter. 



Formation No. 2 of Vertical Section. 



This Formation is first revealed in thin outliers below the mouth of Big 

 Sioux river, and on that stream six miles above its mouth it caps the Bluffs, 

 apparently mingling to some extent with the succeeding bed, and containing 

 at this locality large numbers of Inoceramus problemaiicus and fragments of 

 fishes. Near the mouth of Iowa creek and above, it shows itself worthy of 

 a separate position in the series. It is composed of a dark leaden gray laminated 

 plastic clay, containing few fossils, but great quantities of the sulphate of lime in 

 crystals, assuming a variety of beautiful forms. Its greatest thickness is 

 seen five miles below the mouth of James river. At Dorion's Hills it is seen 

 at low water mark. Entire thickness estimated at ninety feet. Fossils, 

 Ammonites, Inoceramus, Cytheria, Serpula, Oslrea and abundant fish remains. 



Formation No, 3 of Vertical Section. 

 The geographical distribution of this formation and its influence on the 

 scenerj- render it one of the most interesting on the Missouri. It is first seen 

 in thin outliers near the mouth of Big Sioux river, and becomes quite con-

112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



spicuous on the summits of the Bluffs ten miles above Iowa creek. At Dori- 

 on's Hills it reaches to the water's edge and is the prevailing formation from 

 thence to the foot of the Great Bend, where it passes by a gentle dip beneath 

 the water level of the Missouri. At Dorion's Hills there is a fine section of 

 this bed about eighty feet exposed above the water's edge, containing its 

 most abitndant and characteristic fossil, Ostrea congesta. In many places, as 

 opposite the mouth of Running Water, it assumes the form of a long series of 

 precipitous bluffs, giving a pleasing variety to the general monotony of the 

 scenery. This is one of the principal characteristic external features of this 

 formation. 



The upper portions of this rock is a yellowish and gray calcareous marl, very 

 soft and yielding, so that it is easily cut up into numerous ravines by the 

 temporary streams, and thus the bluffs along the Missouri often present the 

 appearance of a seriesof cones split from apex to base. The lower stratum, 

 however, is more com2)act and forms a soft bluish gray limestone. 



Though so well developed and covering so wide an area, the middle and 

 upper portions, at least, of this rock can never be made useful for building pur- 

 poses. Quite soft and friable in places, when detached, it absorbs moisture 

 rapidly and crumbles in pieces. Being a rich calcareous marl, it may be used 

 at some future time as a fertilizer. 



The fossils of this formation, though belonging to few species, so far as is 

 yet known, are numerous in individuals. A species of oyster (0. congesta) 

 is found in great quantities throughout the bed, and in localities Inoceramiis 

 problematicus is abundant. Fish remains, though consisting mostly of scales 

 and obscure fragments, are disseminated throughout the deposit, several species 

 of which have already been identified and described by Dr. Leidy. Entire 

 thickness of this bed about one hundred and fifty feet. 



Xear First Cedar island, a very singular bed makes its appearance super- 

 imposed on No. 3, which we shall consider as probably forming a local upper 

 member of that formation. It extends up the Missouri river to a point near 

 the Great Bend, a distance of about eighty miles. Lithologically it is a dull 

 black, unctuous clay, destitute of any grit, and does not effervesce with an 

 acid. It contains some carbonaceous matter and great quantities of Selenite 

 in crystals. 



Formation No. 4 of Vertical Section. 



This Formation is the most important one in the Cretaceous System 

 of the North West, not only in regard to its thickness and its geographi- 

 cal distribution, but also in its influence on the topographical features 

 of the country. It is only second in interest to the succeeding bed in the 

 number, beauty and variety of its organic remains. Commencing about ten 

 miles above the mouth of James river, where it is seen only in their outliers 

 capping the distant hills or bluff's, it continues gradually assuming a greater 

 thickness as we ascend the Missouri until reaching the Great Bend, where it mo- 

 nopolizes the whole region, giving to the country underlaid by it a most gloomy 

 and sterile aspect. At the Great Bend it attains a thickness of two hundred 

 feet, and continues to occupy the country bordering on the Missouri to the 

 mouth of Grand river, where, in consequence of the dip of the strata, it passes 

 gradually beneath the water level of the river. 



After dipping beneath the water level between Grand and Cannon Ball 

 rivers, this formation again rises to the surface about thirty miles below the 

 mouth of Milk river, (far up towards the sources of the Missouri,) by a reversed 

 dip of the strata from beneath the northern portion of the Great Lignite Basin, 

 as will be seen by reference to the section on the map. Near the mouth of 

 the Muscle Shell river it occupies the whole country for a distance of about 

 eighty miles, and thins out upon the tops of the hills near the mouth of the 

 Judith river. 



On the Yellow Stone I observed Formation No. 4 in but one locality, about 

 eighty miles above the mouth of that river. It does not attain a great thick-

nes3, and is probably a ridge left after the denudation of the Cretaceous strata 

 previous to the deposition of the Tertiary. Neither the Cretaceous beds, 

 uor the Tertiary that overlie them, exhibit in this vicinity any evidences of 

 upheaval. The Cretaceous strata here have an extent of only about eight 

 miles, and arc exposed only along the banks cut by the river, yet in that space 

 they reveal the remains of marine mollusca in a profusion which I have seen 

 in no other locality. The whole thickness exposed on the Yellow Stone does 

 not exceed twenty-five feet above the water level, and the distant hills on 

 either side are composed of Tertiary beds. At this locality the fossils show a 

 complete blending of this and the succeeding bed, in the ascending series. 



We will now return to White or Smoking Earth river below Fort Pierre, and 

 trace this formation into the interior of tliat interesting region. Passing up the 

 valley of White river, we find it occupying the country bordering upon that stream 

 for about fifty miles above its mouth. Near this point outliers of the White river 

 Tertiary Basin begin to cover the highland, and No. 4 is seen along the river 

 for about twenty miles farther, when it is concealed by Tertiary strata. The 

 intervening country east and north east of the Bad Lands to the Shyenne river. 

 a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, is for the most part underlaid by 

 this bed, except an extension of Fox Ridge, to the sources of the Teton river, 

 which is composed of Formation No. 5 of the Vertical Section. The extensive 

 area drained by the Shyenne river is composed of No. 4, excepting tlie sources 

 of a few of its tributaries. Sage and Bear' creeks take their rise in the "White 

 river Tertiary Basin, but flow mostly through this Formation, revealing large 

 quantities of Cretaceous fossils. A few small tributaries have their origin in 

 the Fox Ridge, and Cherry river has its source in the Lignite Tertiary Basin, 

 near the head waters of the Little Missouri. 



lu summing up the extent of country underlaid by this great formation, we 

 find that south of the Lignite Basin, it occupies an area of two hundred 

 miles in length and one hundred in breath, or twenty thousand square miles. 

 North of the Great Lignite Basin, commencing at its first appearance near Milk 

 river, we find it covering an area of two hundred miles in length and sixty in 

 breadth, or about twelve thousand square miles. I have been thus particular 

 in estimating its approximate limits and extent of surface on account of its 

 influence on the future destiny of that region. Wherever this deposit prevails 

 it renders the country more completely sterile than any other geological 

 formation I have seen in the nortli-west. We see from the above estimate 

 that it renders barren over thirty thousand square miles of the valley of the 

 Missouri. 



The fossils of this formation are too numerous to mention in detail. The 

 upper and lower members appear to be exceedingly fossiliferous, while the 

 intervening portions of considerable thickness contain only a few imperfect 

 ,specimens of Cephalopoda and the bones oi Mosasatirus missouriensis. The entire 

 thickness of this formation may be estimated at about three hundred and fifty 

 feet. 



Formation No. 5 of Vertical Section. 



This very interesting bed, though diff'ering lithologicallj' from the preceding 

 one, contains many of the same species of fossils. It is worthy, however, of a 

 distinct position in the series, not only from its extent, thickness and difference 

 of composition, but also from the more favorable influence that it exerts upon 

 the country underlaid by it. In ascending the Missouri river it first makes its 

 appearance near the mouth of Grand river, about one hundred and fifty miles 

 above Fort Pierre. Near Butte aux Gres it becomes quite conspicuous, acquir- 

 ing a thiclcness of eighty or one hundred feet, and containing great quantities 

 of organic remains. Here it forms an extension of what is called Fox Ridge, 

 a series of high hills having a northeast and southwest course, crossing the 

 Missouri river into Minnesota at this point. Its north eastern limits I have 

 not ascertained. In its south western extension it continues for a considerable 

 distance nearly parallel with the Missour' osses the Moreau river about 



1857.] 




114 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



thirty miles above its mouth, then forms a high dividing ridge between the 

 Moreau and Shyenne rivers, at -which locality it first took its name. Con- 

 tinuing thence its south westerly course, it crosses the Shyenne, and is seen 

 again in its full thickness at the heads of Opening creek and Teton river, form- 

 ing a high ridge from which tributaries of the Shyenne and Teton take their 

 rise. The little streams flowing into the Shyenne have a north westerly course, 

 while those emptying into the Teton take a south easterly direction. We thus 

 find that this bed underlies an area of about two hundred miles in length and 

 fifty miles in breadth, or about ten thousand square miles. 



The general character of Formation No. 5 is a yellow arenaceous and 

 argillaceous grit, containing much ferruginous matter, and in localities a 

 profusion of Molluscous fossils. It forms a much more fertile soil, more 

 healthy and luxuriant vegetation, sustains a finer growth of timber than 

 Formation No. 4, and abounds in springs of good water. 



Like No. 4, this bed yields in the greatest abundance quite perfect and well 

 preserved organic remains. Many of the species approximate so closely to 

 Tertiary forms, that did we not find them everywhere associated with Am- 

 monites, Scaphites and other genera which are not known to have existed later 

 than the Cretaceous epoch, we should at once pronounce the formation in 

 which they occur Tertiary. The whole thickness of this bed is estimated at 

 one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet. 



System III. — Tertiary. 



This system occupies an extensive area in the country bordering on the 

 Missouri valley. Its wide geographical distribution, its influence upon the 

 topographical features of the country, the mixed and somewhat peculiar cha- 

 racter of its organic remains, render its study of the highest interest to the geolo- 

 gist and palasontologist. It seems to occupy depressions in the Cretaceous strata, 

 as is shown in the illustrative section. I shall speak of this sj'stem on the 

 Upper Missouri as they occur, or as three distinct basins, the intervening por- 

 tions being occupied by rocks, which, as far as has been determined, belong 

 to the Cretaceous epoch. 



The Basins of this systems are as follows : — 



1st. — Les Mauvaises Terres, or Bad Lands of White river, which with their 

 outliers occupy an area of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles 

 in length and one hundred to one hundred and fifty in bi-eadth. Exact limits 

 not yet ascertained. 



2nd. — The Great Lignite Basin, commencing near the mouth of Cannon 

 Ball river and extending nearly to the mouth of the Muscle Shell river, a 

 distance of about six hundred miles. I have traced this formation up the 

 Yellow Stone to the mouth of the Big Horn river, a distance of three hundred 

 miles. Its limits have not been ascertained in several directions. 



Zrd. — The Bad Lands of the Judith river, which occupy an area of forty miles 

 in length and fifteen to thirty in breadth, reposing upon a sandstone, the age of 

 which has not been positively determined. 



Basin \st. — Bad Lands of White River. 

 This most remarkable lacustrine deposit has been comparatively but recently 

 made known to the scientific world. Wondierfnl not alone for its unique scenery, 

 but also for the abundance and importance of its organic remains. Even as yet it 

 has been but partially explored, and yet the results that have been obtained 

 have proved of the highest interest. The profusion of Mammalian and Chclo- 

 niau remains contained in this deposit of species and in most cases genera, 

 though closely allied yet differ from all known living forms, which must render 

 it, when fully explored and studied, classic ground to the geologist and pal;^- 

 ontologist. A history of the progress of its exploration up to 1853, with 

 elaborate descriptions of many of its organic remains, may be found in a 

 magnificent memoir entitled " The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska," written by 

 t'rof. Joseph Leidy, and published by the Smithsonian Institution. 



[May, 




NATUBAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 115 



la their lithological characters these deposits differ very materially from 

 those of the two succeeding basins, being composed of Avhitish clays and 

 calcareous and siliceous marls and grits, and entirely destitute, so far as 

 known, of any vegetable remains, except very rare fragments of silicified wood. 

 It is chiefly remarkable as being a vast deposit in which were entombed im- 

 mense numbers of Mammalian and Chelonian animals, for the beauty and 

 perfection with which their bones have been preserved, and its unique scenery. 

 The few Molluscous fossils which have been found, show most conclusively its 

 purely fresh water origin, being confined to the genera Ilclix, I'lanorbis, 

 Limnea, c^-c. We have also at this time very conclusive evidence that it belongs 

 to the Miocene age.* 



The main body of the Bad Lands of White river covers an area of about one 

 hundred miles in length and fifty to sixty in breadth, and it is that portion 

 chiefly which is represented on the map. We have satisfactory evidence, 

 however, from its outliers, that it once occupied a very much larger area, and 

 that it has been removed by denudation. In the section it is represented 

 l)y Big Ox and Medicine Hills, these localities revealing the only indications 

 of it along the Missouri river. We have also evidence of its existence to a 

 greater or less extent throughout the valley of the Running Water, also that it 

 covers large portions of the country bordering upon the Platte, especially on 

 its North Fork, and a much larger space might be colored on the map, but we 

 have preferred to let it represent what is now known with considerable pre- 

 cision, and wait for the results of future labors to render our knowledge more 

 complete. 



Basin 2nd. — Great Lignite Deposit. 



This basin occupies a more extensive geographical area on the Missouri than 

 that of the other two united. It has been known since the expedition of 

 Lewis and Clark that a vast formation existed on the Upper Missouri, con- 

 taining Lignite, &c. Information of a like nature has been published by 

 former explorers since that time, but without details of its lithological cha- 

 racters or collection of its fossils that would enable us to determine its age or 

 extent. The collections of fossils now obtained show most conclusively that it 

 possesses the mixed character of a fresh water and estuary deposit, and that it 

 cannot be older than the Miocene period. It is composed mostly of clays, sands, 

 sandstone and lignites, and has already yielded numerous animal as well as 

 vegetable fossils of great perfection and beauty. It is chiefly remarkable, 

 however, for the evidence that it reveals to us of the variety and luxuriance of 

 the flora of that period. In this respect it differs more especially from the 

 other two deposits. 



The extent of country known to be occupied by this basin I have estimated 

 at four hundred miles in length and one hundred and fifty in width, or about 

 sixty thousand square miles. We thus come to an approximate idea of the 

 immense area occupied by this formation, though I am satisfied that when 

 it is thoroughly studied it will be found that the above estimate is much too 

 low. 



Basin 3rd. — Bad Lands of ike Judith. 



This exceedingly interesting deposit occupies a depression in a sandstone 

 formation which rises to the water level at the mouth of Little Rocky Mountain 

 creek from beneath the well-known Cretaceous bed No. 4 of the Vertical Sec- 

 tion. It presents perhaps the most rugged scenery on the Missouri river, the 

 denudation and erosion having been much greater than at the Bad Lands of

AVhite river. But the most remarkable feature of this basin is the wonderful 

 disturbance of the strata. So much are the beds disturbed and blended to- 

 gether by forces acting from beneath, that it seems almost hopeless to obtain 

 a section showing with perfect accuracy the order of superposition of the 

 different strata. 



The lignite beds throiighout this basin, though well marked, are of so earthy 

 a character as to have ignited spontaneously in but few places. Indeed the 

 impurity of the lignite forms the most essential lithological difference between 

 this deposit and the Great Lignite Basin below Fort Union. In some places 

 metamorphic rocks have been thrown up through the entire thickness of the 

 strata. Some remarks upon the age of this deposit will be found in a suc- 

 ceeding paper by F. B. Meek and the writer. 



Formation No. 1 ? of tee General Section, 

 As seen near the mouth of Judith river. 



Although the formation of which I am about to speak has already revealed 

 many important facts, the organic contents of its strata differ so materially 

 from those of any other with which I am acquainted in the North West, that 

 we are unable to fix with certainty its position in the geological scale. 

 From its lithological characters we may refer it to No. 1 of Vertical Section, no 

 difference being seen more than would be expected from their widely sepa- 

 rated geographical positions. These facts have already been published in the 

 Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, from which I 

 extract the following paragraph :* 



" In our section of the Nebraska formations, given in a paper published in 

 the 8th vol. of the Proceedings of the Academy, page 63, it will be remembered 

 we placed provisionally the beds of sandstone and clay composing formation 

 No. 1, seen at the Mouth of Big Sioux river and below there, along with the 

 Cretaceous strata, stating at the same time that they were not positively 

 known to belong to that system. We still think it barely possible these 

 beds may be older than Cretaceous, though if represented, as we think they 

 are, by similar beds seen holding about the same position near the mouth of 

 Judith river, far up towards the sources of the Missouri, we must either refer 

 them to the Cretaceous system, or admit the introduction of the genus Baculites 

 before that epoch, as we have fragments of a small species of that genus from 

 the Judith river beds. At the same time it should be borne in mind that 

 these strata at the last named locality are characterized by a group of fossils 

 remarkably distinct from those in the rocks above, and that one species be- 

 longs to the genus Ilettangia, a type of bivalves, not known to occur, in the 

 old world, in more modern formations than those of the age of the Lias. If not 

 older than Cretaceous, we think, from these facts, as well as from the strati- 

 graphical position of these beds, they probably represent some of the older- 

 members of that system." 



Although all our information as yet obtained respecting this sandstone 

 formation is obscure, we have indications that when thoroughly studied, it 

 will prove one of the most important and widely distributed in the far West. 

 From all the evidence I can obtain after a careful study and compai'ison of 

 these beds, with the minute descriptions of Sir John Richardson, and still later 

 those of Mr. Isbister, I am led to believe, with some confidence, that this forma- 

 tion is but a southern extension of the great lignite formations mentioned by 

 those gentlemen as stretching along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, 

 far northward to the Arctic sea. Though, as suggested in a former paper by 

 Mr. Meek and me, some of these lignite deposits in the north western portions 

 of the British possessions may belong to the Tertiary epoch.

Descriptions of new Species and Genera of Fossils, collected by Dr. F. V. Hayden

 of other portions of the United States and Territories.

Most of the fossils, and many of the notes and memoranda upon -which this 

 paper is based, although collected previous to the presentation of our last com- 

 munication to the Academy, arrived in the States since that paper was in print. 

 Consequently, we have now not only the means of adding many new and in- 

 teresting species to the list of ancient moUusca previously knoAvn from Nebraska, 

 but the late explorations of Lieut. Warren have also brought to light some 

 additional information in regard to its general geology, which we have embodied 

 in the following remarks. 



Before presenting these facts and conclusions, justice to former explorers re- 

 quires that we should at least give a brief statement of the results of such 

 expeditions as have contributed to the development of the geology of this region. 



The first reliable accounts we have of the general physical characters of the 

 upper Missouri country, were given to the world in the report of Lewis and 

 Clark's expedition to the Columbia in 1804—5—6. The explorations of these 

 gentlemen, in addition to bringing out a large amount of information of a dif- 

 ferent character, established the fiict of the occurrence of Cretaceous rocks at 

 the Great Bend of the Missouri below Fort Pierre, and of the existence of what 

 was supposed to be " stone coal" (Lignite,) in the Mandan country. Various 

 beds of clay, sand, sandstone, &c., were mentioned in their report, but without 

 any suggestions respecting their age. 



In 1832, the Prince of Neu Wied and party also ascended the Missouri to its 

 sources ; and the results of his explorations, embodying a great amount of 

 highly interesting information respecting the geography, natural history, &c., 

 of the country explored, has been published in the form of a large quarto 

 volume, accompanied by a magnificent folio atlas of plates, illustrating the 

 scenery of the country, and the manners and customs of its native tribes, in a 

 style of art rarely equalled on this side of the Atlantic. Respecting the geology 

 of the country, however, the Prince's expedition added little of importance be- 

 yond the discovery of Mosasaurus Missouricnsis, to the results of Lewis and 

 Clark's expedition.* 



Mr. Nicollet, the well known Geographer, visited this country in 1839, as- 

 cending the Missouri to Fort Pierre, and making on his way up a fine collection 

 of Cretaceous fossils at the Great Beud.f Although passing rapidly through 

 the country, he formed a tolerably correct idea of its geology, and gave in his 

 report a vertical section of the Cretaceous rock seen below Fort Pierre, which 

 is correct, excepting that he seems to have had no knowledge of No. 2, and as 

 we think, without sufficient reason, represented two of the subdivisions of No. 3 

 as distinct formations ; No- 1 he appears to have referred to the carboniferous 

 system. As he did not go above Fort Pierre, he probably Saw nothing of No. 5, 

 though some of its characteristic fossils were presented to him by gentlemen 

 connected with the Fur company. 



♦The Prince lost nearly all of his gco'ogical specimens by the burning of the Far 

 Company's steam boat.

118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



la 1843, Mr. Edward Harris, who accompanied the distinguished Ornitholo- 

 gist Audubon to the mouth of Yellowstone River, brought back specimens from 

 various localities along the Missouri River, some of which verified the state- 

 ments of former explorers, while others gave evidence of the existence of a fresh- 

 water formation near Fort Union. 



At various times after this, specimens of mammalian remains were brought 

 iu by gentlemen connected with the American Fur Company, indicating the ex- 

 istence of an interesting tertiary deposit on White River; the first account of 

 which was published by Dr. H. A. Prout, of St. Louis, in the American Journal 

 of Science, 1847. 



In 1849, Dr. John Evans, one of Dr. Owen's assistants in the geological survey 

 of the Chippeway Land District, was sent by that gentleman on an expedition 

 to the Mau,vaises Terres of White River, and brought back a fine collection of 

 Mammaliaa and Chelonian remains, which w^re investigated by Prof. Leidy, of 

 Philadelphia. He also collected at the Great Bend, Sage Creek, and Fox Hills, 

 many interesting Cretaceous fossils, which were investigated by Dr. D. D. Owen, 

 and published in his final report in 1852. Dr. Evans' observations, embracing a 

 section of the Bad Lands, together with a deseription of their physical features, 

 were also published in this report. 



In the following year Mr. Thaddeus A. Culbertson visited the Upper Missouri 

 country under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, during which expe- 

 dition he collected some interesting vertebrate remains from the White River 

 formations. He also ascended the Missouri on the Fur Company's boat to a 

 point above Fort Union, noting the character of the face of the country, and the 

 occurrence of lignite beds at various localities. 



In the spring of 1853, Dr. Evans again visited this country incidentally, while 

 on his way to Oregon Territory, in the geological survey of which he was en- 

 gaged, uuder the patronage of the general government. During this expedition 

 he made another extensive collection of vertebrate remains, and some fresh- 

 water mollusca at the Bad Lands of White River, as well as some interesting 

 Cretaceous fossils from Sage Creek. The mammalian remains of this expedition 

 were studied by Prof. Leidy, and the other fossils by Dr. Evans and Dr. Shu- 

 mard, and published in the Proceedings of the Acad. Nat. Sc. at Philadelphia, 

 and the Acad. Sciences of St. Louis. 



At the same time (1853) the writers of this paper were employed by Prof. 

 James Hall, of Albany, N. Y., to visit the Bad Lands of White River, for the 

 purpose of making a collection of the Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils of that 

 region. This expedil^ion brought back an extensive and interesting collection 

 of vertebrate remains from the Bad Lands, and of Cretaceous fossils from Sage 

 Creek, as well as from the Great Bend and other localities along the Missouri 

 below Fort Pierre. The first were investigated by Prof. Leidy, and published in 

 the Proceedings of the Acad. Nat. Sc. at Philadelphia; and the latter by Prof. 

 Hall and one of the writers,* and published in the Transactions Acad. Arts and 

 Sciences, Boston. 



In this latter paper a brief vertical section of the rocks seen during the expe- 

 dition, and a complete list of all the mollusca then known from the Cretaceous 

 and Tertiary rocks of that country, were given. The fact that the fossils charac- 

 terizing the Cretaceous formations of Texas and New Mexico belong to different 

 types from those occurring in the northwest, was also in this paper made 

 known for the first time, in the following words : "Among all the collections 

 made in Texas by Dr. Roemer and others, and of all those brought by the 

 , Boundary Survey Expedition, and other surveying and exploring parties, which 

 we have seen, there is but a single species which we regard as doubtfully identi- 

 cal with one from Nebraska. This is Inoceranms Barabini, Morton, (I. Crispii, 

 Mantell (?) )."

the general geology of the country, its soil, scenery, &c., was likewise given to 

 the public by Prof. Hall, in an interesting paper read before the American 

 Association for the Advancement of Science, at the Providence meeting. 



Subsequent to all these expeditions, one of the writers* again visited Ne- 

 braska, and spent two years in traversing various portions of that country ; part of 

 which time he was aided by Col. A. J. Vaughan, Indian agent, and afterwards 

 by Mr. Alexander Culbertson, and other gentlemen of the American Fur Com- 

 pany. During this expedition he explored the Missouri to the vicinity of Fort 

 Benton, and the Yellow Stone to the mouth of Big Horn River. Also consider- 

 able portions of the Bad Lands of White river, and other districts not immedi- 

 ately bordering on the Missouri. The vertebrate remains collected by him, as 

 may be seen by reference to the various papers by Prof. Leidy in the Proceed- 

 ings of the Academy, embrace a larger number of species than all those previ- 

 ously known from that country, many of which belong to new and remarka- 

 ble genera. Large collections of mollusca were also obtained from the Creta- 

 ceous and Tertiary formations, and have since been published by us, together 

 with remarks on the general geology of the country, in a series of papers in the 

 Proceedings of the Academy Nat. Sc. Phila. Vol. viii. 



Again, in 1856, the same one of the writers returned to that country in con- 

 nection with a government expedition under the direction of Lieut. G. K. War- 

 ren. The new Cretaceous and Tertiary invertebrate remains, together with the 

 new facts in regard to the geology of the country, collected by this expedition, 

 form the basis of this paper. 



Up to the publication of our first paper, about fifty-six new species of 

 Cretaceous and Tertiary mollusca had been published from Nebraska, by Drs. 

 Morton, Owen, Evans and Shumard, and by Prof. Hall and one of the writers. 

 Since that time, sixteen additional new species have been published by Drs. 

 Evans and Shumard, making in all seventy-two species hitherto published by 

 others from that country. Our own investigations (including those here described) 

 have made known one hundred and fifty new species, and two new genera, 

 many of the former of which also belong to types not hitherto recognized in 

 this country. Of these one hundred and fifty species, fifty-four (if we include 

 the Judith River, freshwater and estuary species) belong to the Tertiary system, 

 and ninety-six to the Cretaceous. Fifty of the Tertiary species belong to fresh 

 water and land types, and four to genera inhabiting salt and brackish waters ; 

 being about four-fifths of all the land and freshwater Tertiary species hitherto 

 made known from American formations. The geological position, and vertical 

 range of all our new species, and several of those published by others from the 

 north-west, as well as a number of the well known and widely distributed forms 

 such as Scaphites Conradi, Ammonites lobatvs, A. placenta, Nautilus Dekayi, In- 

 oceramiis problemaiicus, Mosasaurus Missotiriensis,f ^c.,have been determined with 

 considerable accuracy ; so that we have now the means of tracing out the 

 parallelism between these deposits and their equivalents in other countries. 



In a general vertical section of the Nebraska formations given in a paper com- 

 municated by us to the Academy in November last, it will be remembered, we 

 represented the White river Tertiary formations as on a parallel with the Eocene, 

 or oldest member of that system. In doing this we merely followed the pub- 

 lished views of others, without intending to give it as the expression of an 

 opinion based on any of our own investigations : as all the organic remains yet 

 found in that basin, with the exception of a few freshwater shells described by 



* Dr. Hayden. 



tin a section of the Nebraska formntions accompanying the last paper communicated 

 by us to the Academy, we gave as the position in which the remains of Mosasnurus occur 

 in the north west, the upper part of No. 5. This was in consequence of erroneoui 

 infonnanon in regard to the locality from which the specimens given to the Prince of Neu 

 Wied were obtained. The locality (at the Great Bend of Missouri) has since been visited 

 by one of us, and many specimens obtained ; they occupy a horizon about the middle 

 of No. 4 of the section.

Drs. Evans and Shumard, belong to the vertebrata, and are consequently oat 

 of our line of investigation. 



During the later explorations in that region, facts were observed tending 

 to throw doubt upon the conclusion that these formations belong to the 

 Eocene epoch. Among other facts of this nature, we would mention that a 

 friable sandstone seen crowning some of the hills near Moreau River, in which 

 specimens of a Cyrena described in one of our former papers (6'. Moreauensis) 

 and Ostrea sublrigonalis (E. & S.,) were found associated with large bones sup- 

 posed to be those of Titanotherium^ and which bed we had regarded as probably 

 a distant outlier of the White river formations, was found to be the same as 

 the lowest bed of the Great Lignite basin extending far to the northward. 



Now as the Tilanotherium bed of the White river basin is the oldest member of 

 that series, it must be manifest if the species of the Tilanotherium occurring 

 Rt these two localities are really identical, we must either admit the remains 

 of that animal had a great vertical range, which is not the case in the White 

 River deposits, or suppose these two basins are nearly or quite exactly on 

 a parallel. 



In addition to the foregoing, some Miocene deposits seen crowning the sum- 

 mits of hills on the east side of the Missouri, near the mouth of White River, 

 were traced by a series of outliers up the valley of the latter stream, to where 

 they were found to pass into the upper part of the well known Mauvaises Terres, 

 extending towards the sources of that stream, and which have furnished so many 

 interesting vertebrate remains. 



After comparing and discussing these facts we suspected that the whole of 

 the White River basin might be more properly of Miocene than Eocene age, and 

 upon glancing over D'Orbigny's tables showing the vertical range of the 

 various genera of fossil vertebrata, and consulting Picktets Traite de Palceon- 

 tologie, we observed that several of the old genera to which Dr. Leidy refers the 

 White River Mammalia are regarded in the Old World as characteristic of 

 the Miocene epoch. These enquiries, however, being out of our line of 

 investigation, we wrote Prof. Leidy, the distinguished comparative anatomist of 

 Philadelphia, who has so ably investigated all the vertebrate remains hithert<^> 

 brought from Nebraska, stating our doubts and suspicions respecting the age of 

 these deposits, and requesting him to examine very carefully the large water- 

 worn bones from Moreau and Grand Rivers, occurring in what we knew to be 

 the lowest bed of the Lignite basin, and to inform us if he was quite satisfied 

 they are identical with Titanotherium Prouti ; also making enquiries respecting 

 the Eocene or Aliocene affinities of the various new genera of Mammalia 

 described from the Bad Lands of White River by him. Since that time we were 

 much gratified to learn from Prof. Leidy that as much as three or four weeks 

 previous to the reception of our letter, he had arrived at the conclusion, from 

 purely palasontological evidence, that the White River deposits must belong 1« 

 the Miocene epoch. 



Prof. Leidy has presented his views in regard to the Miocene affinities of the 

 vertebrata from the White River formations, in some interesting remarks ac- 

 companying a complete catalogue of all the organic remains described by him 

 from Nebraska, recently read before the Academy ; a copy of which he has 

 kindly placed in our hands in advance of the regular issue of the Proceedings. 

 From these remarks we extract the following in reference to the fossils from 

 the Wliite River basin : 



" Oreodon, Agriochoerus Pcebroiherium, Leptomeryx, Leptauchenia, Protom&ryx^ 

 Merycodus Titanotherium, Leptochaerus, Hyracodon, Merychippus, Ischyromys, Pa- 

 Imolagits, Eumys, Dinictis and Leptarctus, are peculiar, extinct mammalian genera, 

 from the Tertiary formations of Nebraska, which have heretofore been generally 

 viewed as belonging to the Eocene period, but from their affinities, the asso- 

 ciated genera, and the absence of others so common in the Eocene deposits of 

 Europe, I suspect rather belong to the Miocene period. The first seven genera 

 above mentioned are true ruminants, with teeth constructed upon the same type 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 121 



a3 those of living ruminants ; a type which is not found in the Tertiary deposit.^ 

 of Europe and Asia, earlier than the Miocene period. 



Entelodon Palceochcerus, Rhinoceros, llipparion, Sleneojiber, Amphicyon, and Ma- 

 ckairodus, are common to the Nebraska Tertiary deposits and to the Miocene and 

 later Tertiary deposits of Europe ; and they have not been found in the Eocene 

 formations of the latter continent. 



Of tlie genera Anchitherium, ITyopotamus and Hymnodon species are found 

 common to the Nebraska Tertiary deposits and the European Eocene and Mio- 

 cene deposits. 



Remains of P.rloiolherium, Anoplothrrium and Lophiodon, so common in the 

 Eocene formations of Europe, are entirely absent from the Nebraska Tertiary 

 formations. 



Titanotherium of Nebraska most nearly approaches the Miocene Chaliocotherium 

 of Europe and Asia. 



The rodents hchyromys, -Palmolagus and Eumys, most closely approach the 

 Arctomyx, Lrpus and Muh of European Miocene and later deposits. 



Very numerous remains of Tcstudo are found in association with the Nebraska 

 Tertiary mammals ; and extinct species of the same genus belong generally to 

 the Miocene and later deposits of Europe." 



From all the foregoing facts, the Miocene age of these White River formations 

 may, we think, be regarded as established, both by paloeontological and strati- 

 graphical evidence. There are, however, many points of interest in regard to 

 the exact parallelism of these deposits with those of the Great Lignite basin, 

 yet unsettled. If it be true that the large bones previously referred to in both 

 basins, do really belong to the same species of animal, it would seem, from the 

 fact that they occur in the lowest bed of each, that the two basins are not 

 merely both Miocene, but exactly on a parallel. If so, it is very difficult to 

 account for the fact that, out of the numerous organic remains hitherto found 

 in the two deposits, not a single species, excepting Titanotherium Prouti* should 

 be common to both ; especially when we bear in mind the fact that the two 

 basins approach to within forty or fifty miles of each other. 



It is true, several of the Mollusca occurring in the bone bed, or lowest stratum 

 of the Lignite basin, belong to genera only found in salt or brackish waters, 

 and that none but terrestrial and fresh-water types have yet been found in any 

 part of the White River deposits ; thus indicating that one is a lacustrine for- 

 mation, and the other an estuary deposits ; conditions, it is true, not very favor- 

 able to the existence of the same species of mollusca, but hardly sufficient, we 

 think, to account for the fact that all the shells hitherto collected from the lig- 

 nite formations are not merely different species from those described by Drs. 

 Evans and Shumard, from the White River beds, but belong to slightly different 

 types. 



The entire absence, so far as we yet know, of the fossil plants occurring in 

 such great abundance in the Lignite formations, in those of the White River 

 basin, is also worthy of note ; while the lithological differences between the two 

 deposits are well marked. The latter point of difference will be more obvious 

 on comparing the following section of the Lignite formations taken by one of 

 U3,f at a locality thirteen miles above Fort Clark, on the right bank of the Mis- 

 souri, with the section of the Bad Lands of White River, as given by Dr. Evans 

 in Dr. Owen's Report, page 200. 



* Since the«e remarks were communicated to the Academy, we have been informed by 

 Prof. Leidy that he now rather suspects the large bones here alluded to belong to a huge 

 Dinosanrian described by him from these beds, under the name of Thespesius. 

 He further states that he had merely referred them provisionally lo Titanotherium Prouti. 

 from their great size, as none of them he has yet seen show even the articulating ex- 

 tremities.

[May,

and on the Moreau, the entire bed is exposed, and attains a thickness of about 

 thirty feet. At these latter localities it is seen to repose directly upon No. 5, or 

 the most recent member of the Cretaceous system of the north-west, the upper 

 part of which it so nearly resembles in iis lithological characters that ihe line 

 of demarkation betweeu the two can often be only ascertained by the organic 

 remains characterizing: each. This fact, together with the general resemblance 

 of many of the fossils found in the upper part of No. 5 of our general section to 

 Tertiary types, would have caused us to doubt the propriety of referring this 

 part of that bed to the Cretaceous epoch, were it not for the presence of Scaj)h- 

 ites Conradi, and other well marked Cretaceous forms. 



From the estuary character of the fossils found in the bed Q of the last sec- 

 tion, {Ci/rena, Oslrca, Melania, &c.,) and the absence of Cretaceous forms, we 

 think there can be little room to question the propriety of referring it to the 

 Tertiary system. The question, however, in regard to its exact position in that 

 system may yet be regarded as a little doubtful, but the weight of evidence is 

 on the side of the conclusion tliat it is Miocene. This conclusion is also borne , 

 out or strengthened by the general relations at other localities between this 

 bed and those above, in which Miocene fossils occur. 



The preceding section, although not representing all the beds of the great 

 Lignite basin, (there being some higher beds seen at other localities,) gives a 

 correct idea of the composition and general structure of these deposits,* and 

 shows how remarkably they differ in their lithological characters from those 

 of the White River basin, in which fine white argillaceous material so largely 

 predominates, and no lignite or remains of plants have been found. 



Of the age of the fresh-water and Estuary deposits seen near the mouth of 

 Judiih River, we have refrained from the expression of any very decided opinion, 

 in consequence of the fact that they appear to be mingled by upheavals with a 

 series of sandstones, clays, lignite, &c., which we think belong to the same 

 epoch as No. 1 of our general section. Amongst some of the collections inves- 

 tigated by us from these Judith River estuary and fresh-water beds, and pub- 

 lished in one of our former papers, we found species of Faludina, Corbula, &c., 

 so closely related to shells we had from the Great Lignite basin near Fort Clark, 

 that we were for a time in some doubt about the propriety of considering them 

 distinct. In this upper member of the Judith River formations, great numbers 

 of a small oyster occur along with the fresh-water shells of which we have just 

 spoken. This oyster so nearly resembles a species in our possession from the low- 

 est bed of the last section, obtained at a locality near Grand River, that we have 

 not yet seen any characters by which they can be distinguished. We are also 

 inclined to reg.ird these shells as identical with a sjjecies described by Drs. 

 Evans and Shumard from Grand River, under the name of 0. subtriyonalis. 

 There is also, in the fresh-water beds at the Judith localities, a Unio, which we 

 think the same as a shell found in the Miocene lignite formations on the Yellow 

 Stone. In addition to these facts, a species of Trionyx described by Dr. Leidy, 

 from about the middle bed of the Judith fresh-water deposits, is regarded by 

 that gentleman as identical with specimens from the bed Q, near Long Lake 

 below Fort Clark. 



Now as this bed Q, of the previous section at the Moreau, Grand River, and 

 Long Lake localities, beyond all doubt, rests directly upon formation No. 5 of 

 the general section, and forms a part of the Great Lignite series, we would not 

 for a moment hesitate in regarding the deposits of which we have spoken, near 

 the Judith, as Tertiary, were it not for the fact that the saurian and fish remains 

 occurring in these beds, as may be seen by reference to Prof. Leidy's remai-ks 

 respecting them, are allied to Wealden and older types. 



In the midst of evidence of such a conflicting nature, it is of course unsafe to 

 express any very positive opinion respecting the age of these formations. At 



*It should be borne in mind, however, that the beds of lignite represented in this 

 section vary much in extent, as well . s in purity, at different localilies; some of those 

 seen on the Yellow Stone being as much as seven feet in thickness. At Fort Berihold. 

 on the Missouri, a two foot bed is pure enough to be used as fuel.

PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



the same time, as we are strongly inclined to the conclusion that they will prove 

 not merely Tertiary, but about of the age of the lowest beds of the Great Lignite 

 basin, or perhaps a little older, we have therefore placed them provisionally 

 along with the Tertiary beds in the accompanying general section of the Ne- 

 braska rocks. 



In order to give some idea of the nature and order of superposition of the 

 beds of which we have just been speaking, as well as for the sake of comparison 

 with those of the Great Lignite basin, we give below a section taken at the 

 mouth of Judith River, where these beds are least disturbed, and their strata- 

 graphical arrangement can be best seen. 



Section of Fresh-water and Estuary Deposits near the Mouth of Judith River. 



This section embraces all the deposits, as we believe, seen in the Bad Lands 

 of the Judith, in which land and fresh-water shells are known to occur. They 

 appear, as near as could be ascertained, to occupy a local basin in a series of 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 125 



marine deposits, consisting of beds of sandstone and impure lignite, wliich we 

 have regarded provisionally as of the age of No 1 of our general section. 



Lower down the Missouri, near the mouth of Little Rocky Mountain Creek, 

 this last mentioned series of rocks upon which the fresh-water deposits repose at 

 the mouth of the Judith, is clearly seen to pass beneath No. 4 of the general 

 section ; proving that Nos. 2 and 3 are not represented in that part of the coun- 

 try. As no indications were seen in this region of these latter formations, it is 

 probably they are entirely wanting towards the sources of the Missouri. 



The deposits above alluded to, (at the mouth of Judith River,) as probably on 

 a parallel with beds seen near the mouth of Big Sioux River on the Missouri, — 

 (forming No. 1, of the Nebraska section,) — are characterized, as stated in one 

 of our former papers, by a group of fossils remarkably distinct from those oc- 

 curring in any of the higher north western formations ; and there remains some 

 doubt as to whether or not they are older than Cretaceous. The presence of 

 the genus Baculites would seem to establish the fact that they belong to the 

 Cretaceous epoch ; while the occurrence in the same hand specimens with these 

 remains of Baculites, of a species of Hettangii, — a genus of bivalves, not known 

 to occur in the old world in newer formations than the Lias, — would, on the 

 other hand, indicate that these beds are older than Cretaceous. For the pre- 

 seijt, however, we express no decided opinion on this point, but content our- 

 selves with the remark, that we are inclined to think they hold a position near 

 the base of the Cretaceous system, and are probably on a parallel with the 

 Neocomien of the old world, though they may be older. 



The following section, taken near the mouth of Judith River,* will exhibit ap- 

 proximately the lithological characters, and orderof succession of these deposits 

 at that locality. It is not pretended, however, that this section represents all 

 the beds of this series, as others were observed near them, but owing to the dis- 

 tortion and disturbance of the strata, and the unfavorable circumstances under 

 which the observations were made, it was impossible to devote time enough to 

 their examination to collect the means of constructing a connected general 

 section of the whole series. We should also state here that the specimens fur- 

 nishing the data upon which this section, and that of the fresh-water and esta- 

 ary deposits near the same locality, were constructed, although collected some 

 time back, only came to hand since the communication of our last paper.

At several points near the locality where the above section was taken, the bed 

 G, of the last section, with its characteristic fossils, was seen superimposed upon 

 the bed A, of the section here given ; but the line of junction was not suffi- 

 ciently well exposed to determine very satisfactorily whether the upper part of 

 these lower deposits bears marks of denudation previous to the deposition of the 

 overlying freshwater and estuary beds or not. 



On a former occasion we expressed very briefly our views in regard to the 

 parallelism of the Cretaceous formations of Nebraska with those of New Jersey, 

 Alabama, and portions of the far west and south west. In order to make more 

 clear some of these pointj of parallelism, we here reproduce for comparison, 

 with some modifications, the general section of the Nebraska formations ; and

By comparing the foregoing sections with the following general section of the 

 Nebraska rocks, tlie parallelism between the formations, so far as the Cretaceous 

 rocks of the North West are represented in Alabama and New Jersey, will be 

 at once understood. 



In the following section of Nebraska rocks it will be observed we have placed 

 together all the Tertiary deposits known to us, without intending to express 

 any opinion in regard to the comparative ages of these formations. We have 

 also written in the column opposite them the word "Miocene;" this, so far as the 

 Judith River fresh water and Estuary formations are concerned, is done pro- 

 visionally. We have likewise made three subdivisions of formation No. 3. 

 This latter change is made mainly upon lithological ditferences between what 

 we regard as probably subordinate members of the same formation. The upper 

 or dark bed of very fine argillaceous matter, passes both downwards, and at 

 some points, horizontally into the gray marl below it, and appears to be local, 

 while the gray marl, in its turn, passes imperceptibly into the light colored 

 limestone below. 



It is due to the lamented Mr. Nicollet that we should state here, he saw the 

 two beds above mentioned, and noticed their differences in his report ; but in 

 consequence of the fact that he referred the Inoceramus occurring in the lime- 

 stone {[. prohkmaticus) to /. Barabini, a fossil not known below No. 4 and 5 of 

 the section, if indeed it occurs at all in the Nebraska beds, we were always at 

 a loss to understand his section. In addition to this, neither of us had ever 

 visited localities where this bed or the dark deposit forming the upper part of 

 No. 3 is exposed, previous to the late explorations.

The position and vertical range of such fossils as are known to be common 

 to the North West and New Jersey, in the foregoing general section of the 

 Nebraska rocks, clearly establishes, as stated in our paper communicated to 

 the Academy in November last, that formations No. 4 and 5 of the North 

 West, are on a parallel with the beds b. c. d. and e. of the New Jersey serief. 



After a careful reviewiof the subject, we are now satisfied that the parallel- 

 ism of these beds may \ be more closely drawn, or in other words, that the 

 second green sand bed of the New Jersey section rejjresents No. 5 of Nebraska, 

 and that No. 4 of the latter region is on a parallel with the beds c. d. and e. of 

 New Jersey. 



At the same time the identity of No. 1 of the North West, with the beds com- 

 posing f. of the New Jersey section, is scarcely less apparent. It is true tbig 

 latter opinion rests mainly upon stratigraphical and lithological evidence, yet 

 these points of analogy are so strong as to possess great weight. In order 

 that this may be better understood and appreciated, we quote below from 

 notes taken by one of us''*' in 1855, a description of an exposure of No. 1 

 seen on Big Sioux River, which will show, by comparison with the New Jersey 

 section, the striking resemblance between the beds holding a position at the 

 base of the Cretaceous formations at these distantly separated localities. 



" Six miles above the month of Big Sioux River we have an exposure of 

 impure lignite about 12 inches in thickness, underlaid by alternate layers of 

 sandstone, loose clay, yellow and ash colored arenaceous clays, and fine whitish 

 clay. The strata containing clay have quite distinct impressions of leave?. 

 which appear to have belonged to dicotyledonous trees. We have also, near 

 the base of the exposure, some fine impressions of leaves in dark tough gray, 

 siliceous, concretionary rock. Much pyrites and fragments of fossil wood occur 

 in these beds." 



The points of analogy between these lower deposits (No. 1) of the norih-weet, 

 and formation f at the base of theNew Jersey section, as well as with an extensive 

 series of deposits holding the same position in Alabama, (formation E of the 

 Alabama section,) and throughout a great area of country in Arkansas, Tesae, 

 and New Mexico, will be more fully illustrated by the following section taken in 

 north-eastern Kansas, where this series appears to be more extensively de- 

 veloped than at any localities known to us in Nebraska. 



For this section, as well as much other interesting and important information 

 respecting the geology of the country surveyed by him, we are indeb'ed to the 

 kindness of Major F. Hawn, formerly of the geological survey of Missouri, but 

 now connected with the lineal survey of portions of Kansas Territory. We give 

 it exactly as communicated to us by him, excepting that we have thrown it into 

 a tabular form, and added columns showing the parallelism of the beds with 

 those of New Jersey and Nebraska. To those acquainted with Major Hawn, it 

 is unnecessary for us to say he is a careful conscientious observer, whose state- 

 ments are worthy of the fullest confidence. 



The beds represented in this section were not all seen at any one locality, but 

 their thickness, composition and order of succession were determined from ex- 

 aminations made at numerous exposures in the country east of the sixth prin- 

 cipal meridian, between the northern boundary of Kansas and the Republican 

 fork of Kansas River.

The similarity between the beds from c. to 1. inclusive, of the above section, 

 and formation f. of the New Jersey series, when taken in connection with their 

 position in relation to the higher formations, is too obvious to leave much 

 room to doubt that they belong to the same horizon. 



Mr. Henry Pratten, of the Geological Survey of Illinois, to whose liberality 

 we are indebted for a full abstract of notes taken by him on the geology of the 

 country along the California trail between Fort Leavenworth and San Francisco, 

 informs us that he met with the lower members of the Nebraska section at seve- 

 ral points along Platte River, above Fort Laramie. No. 1, he says, as in portions of 

 north-eastern Kansas, and on the Missouri below the Big Sioux, reposes directly

upon upper Carboniferous strata, and presents its usual characters, excepting 

 that the beds of sandstone are more frequently white. lie did not see No. 2 well 

 exposed, its place in the series being usually occupied by a slope. Above this, 

 however, he saw the lower beds of No. 3, presenting their usual lithological 

 characters, and containing the fossil everywhere marking this horizon, (Inoce- 

 ramus problematicus. )* 



Mr. Hawn writes us, he has been informed by an intelligent Deputy Surveyor, 

 that the formations represented in his section, especially the beds below the 

 upper limestone, were seen by him at intervals along the sixth principal me- 

 ridian, as far south as his survey extended, or to the fifth standard parallel, near 

 the Arkansas River. 



Exactly similar deposits were observed by Dr. George B. Shumard in the 

 vicinity of Fort Washita, and the Cross Timbers in northern Texas. He de- 

 scribes these formations as consisting of " grayish yellow sandstone, with in- 

 tercalations of blue, yellow and ash colored clays, and beds of white and bluish- 

 white limestone. The limestone reposing on the clays and sandstones." (See 

 Capt. Marcy's report of Explorations on Red River, page 181.) 



In one of the upper beds of this series Dr. Shumard found, along with several 

 new species of Cretaceous fossils, some of the same shells collected by Dr. 

 Roemer from similar depv.sits at New Braunfels, and other localities further south 

 in Texas. He likewise collected from the same beds, species identical with 

 some of those found in the same position by Mr. Marcou at Pyramid Mountain, 

 in New Mexico, thus establishing the parallelism of the formations at all these 

 localities.! 



A section of these deposits taken by Mr. Marcou at Pyramid Mountain, near 

 the Llano Estacado, (Bulletin Geol. Soc. France, Tome 12, p. 878,) corresponds 

 remarkably in its general features with Mr. Hawn's section already given, of 

 these formations in north-eastern Kansas. The identity of composition and 

 order of succession of the various beds represented in these sections, can scarcely 

 be due to accident, but points rather to the conclusion that they were deposited 

 at the same time in the same ocean. 



For the sake of comparison we give below, in a tabular form, Mr. Marcou's 

 section of Pyramid Mountain, with columns showing the parallelism of the 

 various beds with the formations in Nebraska, Kansas, New Jersey and Alabama, 

 as well as his views respecting the parallelism of the same with formations of 

 the Old World. 



* Since these remarks were written, I have received with deep regret the sad news of 

 Mr. Pra'ten s death. In making this announcement, it affords me a mel incholy pleasure 

 to bear witness t p his merits as a man and a devoted cultivator of natural science. Along 

 with all the artless simplicity of a child, he possessed an intellect of no ordinary powers ; 

 while his studious habits and untiring perseverance, aided by a wonderful memory, had 

 enabled him, under circumstances far from propitious, to acquire an amount of knowledge 

 in various departments of science, of which the most favored might be proud. Perhaps 

 no person now Uving possesses a better knowledge of the western carboniferous fossils 

 than he did; and yet this was only one of several branches of science to which he had 

 devoted many years of his life. His quiet habits and unpretending manners, however, 

 had to a great extent prevented his real merits fr.im being duly appreciated outside of 

 a comparaiively limited circle of personal acquaintances. With all, and better than 

 all, his other qualities of head and heart, Mr. Pratten was a high minded, honorable 

 man. F. B. M.

Mr. Marcou does not mention the occurrence of Inoceramus problematicus in 

 the limestone (a) of his section at this locility, but it has been found in this 

 position at various localities in the south-west by others, as stated in our last 

 communication. From the facts given by him, there is also scarcely room for 

 a doubt, but the specimen of Ostrea congesta, we mentioned seeing in his col- 

 leetionf (Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci. November last) from Galisteo, was either 

 found in this bed or the clays immediately below it, {b of his section,) in both 

 of which deposits it occurs in Nebraska. 



As Pyramid Mountain is but an isolated portion, left by the denudation of 

 the surrounding strata, of a great elevated plateau known as the Llano Estacado, 

 which occupies a vast area of country in western Texas and New Mexico, it is 

 highly probable the beds composing Mr. Marcou's section are widely distributed 



• We think these identical with species found by Dr. George B. Shumard at Fort 

 Washita, Texas, where they appear to hold the same geological position, and are asso- 

 ciated with Ammonites vesperlimis (Morton.) Dr. B. F. Shumard has correctly, as we 

 believe, referred the first to (iryphcBa Pitcheri (Morton), and described the laiter as « 

 new specie*, under the name of Ostrea suhovate. (See Capt. Marcy's Report Explorations 

 Red River, page 205 — Appendix.) We are almost willing to hazard the opinion, that 

 these species will yet be found in Southern Nebraska, or north-eastern Kansas, in forma- 

 tion No. 2 of the Nebraska Section. 



t In alluding to this fact in our last paper, we inadvertently omitted to mention that the 

 specimen seen by us is in the possession of Prof Hall, by whose permission we referred 

 to its occurrence at that locaUty. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 138 



over the far south-west. This conclusion is also borne out by the statements 

 of Capt. Marcy and other explorers of that region. The facts given by this 

 gentleman and Dr. G. G. Shumard, likewise point to the conclusion that the 

 great gypsum deposits of the south-west hold a position equivalent to No. 2, or 

 the upper part of No. 1 of the Nebraska section. 



From all the facts, we are led to believe, as stated on a former occasion, that 

 the divisions No. 4 and 5 of Nebraska, and their equivalents in New Jersej' and 

 Alabama, are entirely wanting, or but meagrely represented, throughout the 

 south-west; and that No. 2 and No. 3 are the main fossil-bearing strata of that 

 region ; while No. 1, which there as in the north-west and in Alabama, rei)0ses 

 on Carboniferous strata, attains a much greater development than in either of 

 those countries. 



Conclusions. 



Ist. We have no evidence that any of the Tertiary deposits now known in 

 Nebi-aska are older than Miocene. 



2d. The estuary and fresh-water deposits at the mouth of Judith River are 

 probably on a parallel with the lowest bed of the Great Lignite basin, though 

 some portions of them ~iay be so.mewhat older. 



'dd. The Great Lignite basin and the Mauvaiies Terres of White River, though 

 probably both Miocene, are not exactly on a parallel. 



Ath. We have in Nebraska a more complete series of Cretaceous formations, 

 and consequently a better standard of comparison for rocks of that age, than is 

 yet known to exist in any other portion of this country. 



bth. The formations in New Jersey and Alabama generally referred to the 

 Cretaceous system, are on a parallel with the iqjper and lower members of the 

 Nebraska section, (No. 1, 4 and 5 ;) while nearly, if not quite all the main fossil- 

 bearing deposits older than Tertiary, and newer than Carboniferous, in Kansas, 

 Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico, are on a parallel with the middle and lower 

 portions of the same. 



Qlh. Although the beds No. 2 and 3 of the north-west, are extensively de- 

 veloped, and probably the principal fossiliferous Cretaceous deposits of the far 

 south-west, we have up to this time, no evidence of their existence east of the 

 Mississippi. Consequently the marked typical differences observable between 

 most of the Cretaceous fossils hitherto found in the south-west, and those 

 characterizing the upper Cretaceous formations of Nebraska, Alabama and 

 New Jersey, are not wholly due to the fact that they belonged to different zo- 

 ological districts ; nor yet, as might be supposed in regard to the Nebraska and 

 New Jersey species, to the modifying effects of physical conditions dependent 

 on latitude ; but mainly to the fact that they belong to another geological hori- 

 zon, and consequently lived during a different epoch. 



7th. There is at the base of the Cretaceous System, at distantly separated 

 localities in Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, Alabama and 

 New Jersey, if not indeed everywhere in North America where that Sys- 

 tem is well developed (at any rate east of the Rocky Mountains), a series of 

 various colored clays and sandstones, and beds of sand, often of great thickness, 

 in which organic remains, excepting leaves of apparently dicotyledonous plants, 

 fossil wood, and obscure casts of shells, are very rarely found, but which every- 

 where preserves a uniformity of lithological and other characters, pointing 

 unmistakeably to a similarity of physical conditions daring their deposition, 

 over immense areas. 



8th. Although the weight of evidence thus far favors the conclusion that this 

 lower series is of the age of the lower Green Sand, or Neocomien, of the old 

 world, we yet want positive evidence that portions of it may not be older than 

 any part of the Cretaceous System.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW FOSSILS.* 

 Ptychoceras Mortoni. 



Shell small and thin, elongate cylindrical ; larger half, or body, very slightly 

 tapering, apparently rounded on the dorsum, and concave along the inner side 

 for the reception of the slender smaller half. Surface ornamented by rather strong 

 annular costae, which are less prominent, and somewhat irregularly divided on 

 the body, and bifurcate occasionally on the smaller part ; dorsum of the slender 

 half ornamented by two rows of very small nodes, arranged upon the costae ; 

 fine indistinct lines of growth mark the shell parallel to the ribs. Aperture, 

 septa, and siphuncle unknown. Length (of specimen imperfect at the aperture, 

 and apex of smaller portion) about 1 inch; breadth -26 inch ; diameter of slen- 

 der part -12 inch ; do. of body -17 inch. 



This shell is about the size, and has much the general appearance of a 

 species described by Dr. Morton from the deep cut of the Chesapeake and Dela- 

 ware canal, under the name of Hamites annuUfer (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 8, 

 pi. xi. fig. 4,; but differs from his figure in having bifurcating instead of 

 simple costae. It is possible, however, that they may not be distinct, though 

 it is hardly probable so important a character as the bifurcation of the costae 

 would have escaped the attention of so close an observer as Dr. Morton. 



Judging from the nodes seen along the dorsum of the smaller portion of our 

 shell, it appears probable similar or stronger nodes may have existed along the 

 outside of the body, or larger half; if so, it must have differed materially in 

 this respect from Dr. Morton's species. When entire our specimen must have 

 been not less than 1 J to 2 inches in length. 



Dedicated to the lamented Dr. George Morton of Philadelphia. 



Locality and position. Great bend of the Missouri, formation No. 4. of the 

 series. 



Serpula? tenuicarinatds. 



Shell growing in groups, or rarely single, slightly compressed-cylindrical, 

 increasing very gradually in size, irregularly curved or flexuous, not spirally 

 coiled; attached by one side nearly the whole length; having a distinctly 

 elevated, linear carina along the upper side ; surface sometimes very obscurely 

 undulating transversely, otherwise smooth. Length unknown; transverse 

 diameter about .14 inch. 



As we have no perfect specimens of this fossil, it is with some doubt we 

 refer it to the genus Serpula. It appears to have no internal septa as in Ver- 

 ■meius ; and we have seen no indications of an operculum as in Vermicularia ; 

 consequently we place it provisionally in the genus Serpula. 



Locality and position. — Mouth of Vermillion River, on the Missouri, formation 

 No. 2 of the series. 



VlTRINA OBLIQUA. 



Shell obliquely oval ; spire much depressed ; volutions four to four and a 

 half, first two or three increasing rather slowly in size, last one ventricose and 

 rapidly enlarging, prominent below ; suture distinct ; aperture circular ; surface 

 unknown. Greatest transverse diameter .64 inch ; height .50 ; diameter of 

 aperture .ST inch. 



Having seen only internal casts of this shell, we are in some doubt about its 

 generic relations ; as its associates, however, belong to land and freshwater 

 genera, and its form agrees very nearly with that of Vitrina, we place it pro- 

 visionally in that genus. It resembles a species described by Reuss and Von 

 Meyer, under the name of V. intermedia from the Tertiary Lacustrine deposits 

 in the north of Bohemia, (see Tert. Siiss. pi. 1 fig.) but has more volutions. 



Locality and position. Mouth Judith River, bed E of the section of freshwater 

 and estuary deposits at that place. 



* lllustrationg to be published hereafter in Lieut. Warren's Report.

Helix occidkntalis. 



Shell thin, rather small, depressed nearly orbicular; volutions four, convex 

 above, proniiuent, or almost subangular a little above the middle of the outside, 

 gibbous below, most convex near the umbilicus ; surface ornamented by regular 

 rather strong oblique lines of growth; suture well defined; umbilicus deep, less 

 than one third the transverse diameter of the shell, exhibiting most of the inner 

 volutions ; aperture round oval, modified slightly by the succeeding whorl ; lip 

 sharp, not reflexed. Greatest transverse diameter .33 inch; height .21 inch ; 

 greatest diameter of aperture .16 inch. 



This neat little Helix is more nearly related to the recent H. strialella of An- 

 thony than to any other shell we have seen figured, but is larger, has a 

 smaller umbilicus, and appears to be more strongly striated. iMr. Anthony says 

 the umbilicus of IT. striateUa is not equal to the body whorl. In the species 

 before us, it is scarcely half equal to the body volution near the aperture. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Helix vitrinoides. 



Shell subglobose; spire elevated; volutions about four, convex, increasing 

 rather rapidly, last one somewhat ventricose, contracted a little near the lip ; 

 suture distinct; umbilicus very small or closed; aperture oval or ovate; 

 (lip reflexed?) ; surface unknown. Height .37 inch ; breadth .44 inch ; greater 

 diameter of aperture .27 inch ; smaller do. .20 inch. 



Of this species wc have only seen internal casts, and consequently know 

 nothing of its surface markings. Judging from the slight contraction of the 

 body whorl of the cast near the aperture, it is probable the lip was thickened 

 and reflexed. 



Locality atid position. Same as last. 



Planorbis tenuivolvis. 



Shell planiorbicular ; spire flat or nearly so ; volutions six to six and a 

 half, extremely narrow and closely embracing ; increasing very gradually, 

 scarcely one-third as broad as high, rounded above, prominent, or almost 

 subangular round the outer margin, from which they round obliquely down- 

 wards and inwards towards the umbilicus, near which they are more prominent 

 or subangular; suture well defined; umbilicus deep, acutely conical ; equal- 

 ling about one-third the greater diameter of the shell, and exhibiting the vo- 

 lutions quite to the apex of the spire ; surface and aperture unknown ; section 

 of volutions extremely narrow and strongly arcuate. Greater diameter .15 

 inch ; height .OG inch. 



This remarkably delicate little shell resembles the following species (P. am- 

 plexus) more than any with which we are acquainted ; it differs, however, in 

 having much narrower and more closely wound volutions ; about the same 

 number being present in specimens measuring not much more than one-third 

 the transverse diameter of that shell.

Planorbis amplexus. 



Shell planorbicular ; spire flat, or nearly so ; volutions six, closely em- 

 bracing, narrow, very gradually increasing, nearly twice as high as wide, 

 rounded on the outside, subangular round the umbilicus ; surface marked by 

 lines of growth, which pass round very obliquely backwards from above to a 

 point below the middle of the outer part of the whorls, where they are again 

 directed slightly forwards, so as to indicate the presence of a broad, undefined 

 sinus, below the middle of the outer lip ; aperture unknown, umbilicus conical, 

 deep, less than half the greater diameter of the shell, exhibiting the inner 

 whorls. Greatest diameter .39 inch ; height .25 inch. 



This species bears some resemblance to our P. convolutus (Proceedings Acad. 

 Nat. Sci. vol. 8, p. 1 20,) but has from one to one and a half more volutions, which

ai-e much narrower and more embracing. The spire also differs ia being flat 

 instead of convex, as in P. convolutus, and the umbilicus is much deeper, narrower 

 and more defined in the species before us. 



Locality and position. Bed C of the section of freshwater and estuarj deposits 

 at mouth of Judith River. 



Planorbis fragilis. 



Shell rather large, very thin, nearly planiorbicular ; (spire much depressed 

 or flattened ?) ; umbilicus large, deep and exhibiting all the whorls to the apex 

 of the spire; volutions five or six, (much depressed or flat above?) prominent 

 below, rounded on the lower outer side, subangular round the margins of the 

 umbilicus ; (periphery angular ?) ; surface marked by rather faint lines of 

 growth. Greatest diameter 1.23 inches ; height about .40 inch. 



As we have seen oilly imperfect specimens of this shell, we thiijk the above 

 description may have to be modified somewhat when better specimens are 

 obtained. In those we have seen, the volutions appear to have been nearly flat 

 or much depressed above, in consequence of which the outer side of the whorls 

 is distinctly angular. This character, however, and the remarkable flatness of 

 the spire, may be, at least to some extent, caused by pressure. 



Locality and position. — Fort Berthold on the Missouri River, ia Lignite Tertiary 

 basin. 



Melania scbtortuosa. 



Shell conical screw-shaped ; spire not much elevated ; volutions about five, 

 very convex, distinctly angular round the middle, increasing rather rapidly 

 from the apex ; suture strongly defined, in consequence of the prominence of the 

 angular whorls; surface and aperture unknown. Length 29 "inch ; breadth •21 

 inch ; apical angle regular, divergence 47°. 



The angular form of the whorls is so conspicuous a character in this species, 

 that it will be at once known from all its associates, and indeed from all the 

 Nebraska species we have seen, by this character alone. It bears considerable re- 

 Bemblance to M. tortuosa of Anthony, (An. Lye. Nat. Hist., N. Y. vol. 6,) a recent 

 species, but has a shorter spire, and not so many volutions. It is, perhaps, 

 nearer in form to M. acuio-carinata of Lea, but may be distinguished by its more 

 distinctly angular body whorl ; the angle on Mr. Lea's species being only well 

 denned on the spire. 



Locality and position. Mouth Judith River, bed C. of the section of fresh- 

 water and estuary deposits at that place. 



Melania omitta. 



Shell small, very slender ; spire elongate conical, acute at the apex ; volutions 

 about seven, flattened, or very slightly convex, increasing very gradually from 

 the apex; suture linear, not deeply impressed ; surface and aperture unknown. 

 Length -42 inch; breadth -12 ; apical angle regular, divergence 23°. 



Although we have seen neither the aperture nor surface markings of this 

 little shell, we have ventured to characterize it, believing its slender form alone 

 will serve to distinguish it from any of the other species with which it is as- 

 sociated.

Melania sdbl.'evus. 



Shell elongate conical; spire elevated (acute at the apex?); volutions (about 

 seven?) very depressed convex; suture rather distinctly defined ; surface appa- 

 rently smooth, but when examined with a lens is seen to be marked by fine 

 obscure lines of growth, crossed by extremely fine, nearly obsolete revolving 

 striae; aperture ovate, angular above; columella and outer lip nearly equally

arcuate; pillar faintly sinuous below. Length about 1-04 inch; breadth -38 

 inch ; apical angle slightly concave, divergence 24". 



This species will be known from all the others we have seen in the Nebraska 

 formations, by its slender spire, and slightly concave sides. It is also propor- 

 tionally longer than any Nebraska species known to us, excepting our M. con- 

 vexa, (Proceedings of the Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 8, p. 125,) from which it may 

 be at once distinguished by its depressed convex, instead of flat, volutions, more 

 defined suture, finer revolving lines, and more slender spire. Unfortunately 

 none of our specimens are quite perfect enough to show the number of volutions ; 

 one specimen consists of five turns of the spire, and, judging from the appear- 

 ance of the broken apex, there were probably about two more. 



Locality and position. Bad lands of Judith River, bed G. of Fresh-water and 

 Estuary formations at that place. 



Melania invendsta. 



Shell conical ovate; spire moderately elevated ; volutions about seven, very 

 slightly convex, increasing rather slowly from the apex; suture linear, not much 

 impressed ; surface marked by obscure lines of growth crossed by fine irregular 

 rather indistinct revolving lines, a few of which, just below the suture, are 

 larger than the others; aperture ovate; outer lip faintly sinuate above, rather 

 prominent below the middle inner lip reflexed upon the imperforate columella, 

 at the base of which it is broadly sinuou3. Length -90 inch ; breadth -37 inch ; 

 apical angle regular or a little convex, divergence 32°. 



This shell is nearer our M. Ncbrasccnsis, (Proceedings of Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 

 8, p. 124,) than any of the Nebraska species known to us, but has about one 

 more volution, and is uniformly more slender, the body volution being propor- 

 tionally much smaller. From M. sublcevus of this paper and any of the varieties 

 of our 31. convexa with which it is associated, it may be known by its much less 

 elongate form, and more obscure surface markings. It appears to be about 

 intermediate between our M. convexa and M. N'ebrascensis, but quite distinct from 

 both. 



Localitij and position. Bad Lands of Judith River, bed A. of the section of 

 frtsh-water estuary strata at that place. 



Melania Warrenana. 



Shell small, somewhat acutely conical ; spire rather elevated, pointed at the 

 apex; volutions about seven and a half, depressed convex, closely wound and 

 increasing gradually from the apex, last one sub-angular round the middle ; 

 suture distinct; surface apparently smooth, or only marked by very faint lines 

 of growth ; aperture broad ovate, obtusely angular above ; outer lip very faintly 

 and broadly sinuate above; columella arcuate, rather faintly sinuate below. 

 Length -29 inch; breadth -14 inch ; apical angle convex, divergence 32®. 



This neat little shell is nearer our M. AntJwni/i, (Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci. vol. 

 8, p. 124,) than any other species with which we are acquainted, but is larger, 

 and its spire more elevated. It has about one and a half to two more vo- 

 lutions than 3f. Anthoni/i ; also the body whorl is comparatively smaller, and 

 the apical angle nine or ten degrees less. We dedicate it to Lieut. G. K. Warren, 

 of the U. S. Top. Engs., who discovered the only specimen we have seen. 



Locality and position. Summit of Square Butte, thirty miles below Fort Clark, 

 on the Missouri, in a gray sandstone — an outlier of one of the lower strata of

Melania tenuicarinata. 



Shell ovate conical; spire turreted, not very much elevated, pointed at the 

 apex ; volutions six, convex, obliquely flattened above ; suture well-defined, in 

 consequence of the prominence of the whirls; surface ornamented by fine 

 regular lines of growth, crossed near the middle of the volutions by from two

to about four distinctly elevated, revolving lines, which become ©bsolete near 

 the apex of the spire ; the upper of these lines is larger than the others, and 

 forms a well-marked keel, while the entire surface, above and below them, is 

 marked br smaller, irregular, revolving lines, which, with the lines of growth, 

 form a very fine indistinct cancellated style of ornament ; aperture oval ovate, 

 obtusely angular above ; outer lip rather sharp, prominent a little below the 

 middle, very faintly sinuous above; columella forming a gentle curve, scarcely 

 sinuate below, not perforate. Length '54 inch ; breadth -29 inch ; apical angle 

 convex, divergence variable with age, averaging about 45''. 



In some of its varieties this species approaches our M. Nebrascensis, (Proceed- 

 ings Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.,vol. 8, p. 124,) but has much more convex volutions, 

 and greatly stronger revolving lines or keels, on the middle of the whorls. 



At the time we described M. Nebrascensis, we had but few specimens, and 

 those very imperfect; along with these there were one or two specimens of the 

 species now before us, which we were then inclined to regard as only a va- 

 riety of 31. Nebrascensis. The collection now in our possession shows, how- 

 ever, that they are distinct, consequently it will be necessary to modify some- 

 what our description of M. Nebrascensis, so as to include only those shells with 

 flattened or depressed convex whorls, and revolving lines, a few of which are 

 larger than others on the middle of the volutions, but never becoming distinct 

 angles or carinas. 



Locality and position. Fort Union, Lignite Tertiary formations. 



Melania convexa, (M. and H.) 



Proceedings of Acad. Nat. Sci. Fhila., Vol. 8, p. 125. 



From the same locality and position as the above, we find amongst some of 

 the late collections specimens presenting differences from that shell, which we 

 suspect may be of specific importance ; we are unwilling, however, without more 

 individuals for comparison, to run the risk of multiplying synonyms by attempt- 

 ing to characterize it as a distinct species. It is a more slender shell than 31. con- 

 vexa, the lower volutions are more rounded, and the suture much more dis- 

 tinctly impressed, especially between the lower whorls. For the present we will 

 designate this form as 3Ielania convexa, var. impressa, and in case further com- 

 parisons prove it to be a distinct species, it may be designated by the latter 

 name. 



Fusns Vaughani. 



Shell fusiform, rather thick ; volutions six to six and a half, convex, obliquely 

 a little flattened or concave above, last one narrowing somewhat abruptly below 

 into the (short?) canal ; ornamented by small regular vertical folds, which are 

 crossed by prominent revolving bands, less than the spaces between, so as to 

 give the surface a coarsely cancellated aspect; of these bands about four on the 

 body volution, and two on those of the spire are larger than the others, and 

 form indistinct nodes, where they cross the vertical folds. Below these four 

 larger bands on the body whorl, there are about five or six other smaller and 

 more oblique bands, which diminish in size from above; while on the upper 

 obliquely flattened, or concave part of the same whorls, as well as on those of 

 the spire, there are about four much smaller revolving bands or lines. Entire 

 .surface marked by distinct lines of growth, which are crossed by fine rather 

 obscure revolving striaj, so as to produce, independent of the larger ornaments 

 above mentioned, a fine reticulated style of marking. Aperture narrow ovate 

 or oval ; outer lip bevelled ; inner lip thin, folded upon the arcuate and tortuous 

 columella. Length about 1-43 inclies ; breadth -75 inch ; apical angle convex, 

 divergence about 54°. 



This species is quite unlike any of those we have hitherto seen from the Ne- 

 braska formations. Although apparently occurring in the same bed with avcII 

 m arked Cretaceous forms, it is, like many of the upper Cretaceous species already 

 described by us from this region, very nearly allied to forms belonging to the 



[May 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 189 



Tertiary system of the old world. One of these, F. rarisulcatus of Dcshays, (Coq. 

 Fos. p. 556, pi. T6, figs. 32, 34,) resembles it very closely in form aud surface 

 characters, but differs in having the outer lip distinctly crenulated within. 



The specific name is given in honor of Col. A. J. Vaughan, Indian Agent for 

 the Upper Missouri country, to wliose patronage we are indebted for many of 

 the Nebraska species heretofore described by us. 



Locality and position. Near mouth of Heart lliver, junction of Upper Cretaceous 

 and Tertiary beds. 



FUSUS SUBTDRRITDS. 



Shell fusiform ; spire conical, turreted, very acute at the apex : volutions 

 about seven and a half, obliquely flattened or a little concave above, conve.x, 

 and ornamented round the middle by a single row of rather prominent nodes, 

 which on the upper whorls are prolonged so as to form more or less distinct 

 vertical folds, last one tapering rather obliquely into the straight canal ; surface 

 ornamented by fine lines of growth, which are crossed by small rather regular 

 elevated thread-like lines, about equalling the spaces between ; suture linear, 

 and when viewed from above is seen to deviate from a regular curve in follow- 

 ing the undulating outline of the prolonged nodes : aperture obovate, narrowing 

 below into the canal. Length about l-TS inches ; breadth -90 inch ; apical angle 

 nearly regular, divergence 55''. 



Tbis species is more nearly related to out F. Newberryi (Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sc. 

 Philada. vol. 8, p. 66) than any shell we have seen, but differs in having a 

 more elevated spire, which is much more acute at the apex ; it also has from two 

 to two and a half more volutions than F. Newberryi, and much more i^rominent 

 nodes. 



Locality and position. Upj)er part of No. 4, near Grand River. 



FCSUS INTERTEXTUS. 



Shell fusiform, or elongate rhomboidal, rather thick ; spire conical, mode- 

 rately'' elevated ; volutions about six, convex below, sloping very obliquely, and 

 concave above, ornamented round the middle by a regular row of vertically elon- 

 gated nodes ; last whoi'l tapering rather gradually into the canal ; suture not very 

 distinct ; surface ornamented by well marked lines of growth, which are crossed 

 by strong, elevated, revolving lines, less than the spaces between on the middle 

 and upper portions of the whorls, but smaller, more crowded, and sometimes 

 alternating in size, below the middle of the last turn ; aperture narrow obovate, 

 obtusely angular above, narrowing gradually below ; margin of outer lip sharj) 

 or bevelled, prominent in the middle, retreating above and below ; inner liji 

 scarcely distinct from the slightly arcuate columella. Length about 1-87 inches : 

 breadth -86 inch: apical angle convex, divergence 50°. 



In many respects this species approaches our F. Newberryi (Proceed. Acad. 

 Nat. Sc. Philada. vol. 8, p. 66,) but differs in the greater elevation of its spire, 

 more elongated form, and stronger, as well as more distant revolving lines. It 

 also has about one more volution, and the apical angle measures 5° less. 



Like Fusus Newberryi, in the prominence of the middle of the outer lip, and 

 consequent subsinuate character of its upper part, this shell approaches some 

 varieties of Pleurotoma, but appears to be a true Fusus. 



Locality and position. Yellow Stone River, 150 miles above its mouth, in a 

 bed apparently a blending of No. 4 and 5 of our section. 



Fusus (Pleurotoma ?) Scakboroughi. 

 Sliell fusiform ; spire conical, acute at the apex ; volutions about six and a 

 half, flattened, or slightly concave above ; .last one contracting abruptly below 

 into a small (rather short?) canal ; suture small, not deeply impressed ; surface 

 ornamented by fine regular lines of growth, crossed by numerous distinct, rather 

 closely arranged, elevated, thread-like lines, which are slightly variable in size, 

 but generally equalling the spaces between ; sometimes more closely crowded 

 and smaller just below the suture, than on the middle of the whorls ; aperture 

 narrow ovate, angular above, tapering into the canal below ; outer lip thin,

140 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



prominent near the middle, and having a broad faint sinus above ; colnmella 

 slightly arcuate. Length about 1'42 inches; breadth -67 inch; apical angle 

 very convex, divergence 40". 



Not having seen a specimen of this species showing very clearly the form of 

 the outer lip, we are left in some doubt as to whether it is not more nearly re- 

 lated to Pleurotoma than Fusus. The lines of growth, are so deflected below 

 the suture, as to indicate the presence of a broad faint sinus in the upper edge 

 of the lip, as in Pleurotoma ; the general aspect of the shell, however, is more 

 like Fusus than Pleurotoma. It is probably one of those connecting links be- 

 tween those genera, often met with amongst fossil species. None of our speci- 

 mens show the entire length of the canal, but we are inclined to think it was not 

 very long. 



There is no other shell in the Nebraska formation No. 5 known to us, resembling 

 this in other respects, that has so remarkably convex a spiral angle, the con- 

 vergence from the first to the second volution being only about 30**, while the 

 angle at the apex is as much as 48°. 



We have named this species in honor of .Mr. George Scarborough, of Owens- 

 boro', Ky., a quiet but devoted cultivator of natural science. 



Locality and position. Butte aux Gres, on the Missouri River, formation No. 5 

 of the section. 



New Gen. PSEUDOBUCCINUM. 



Owing to the fact that the limits of the great genus Buccinum are badly defined, 

 and several attempts have already been made to erect into distinct genera, forms 

 regarded by many of the ablest conchologists as merely sections of that genus, 

 it is with hesitation we venture to propose for a shell of this type a new generic 

 name. Although evidently related to Buccinum, the species before us presents, we 

 think, an ensemble of characters of sufficient importance to be regarded as the 

 type of a distinct group. In the first place, it differs remarkably from the species 

 of that genus known to us, in the deeply arcuate and strongly tortuous charac- 

 ter of its columella, as well as in the comparatively large size of the body volu- 

 tion and aperture. So distinctly marked are these characters, that it appears 

 probable, if the matrix were removed from the inside of the shell, the whole 

 interior, quite to the apex of the spire, would be visible from below. It like- 

 wise differs from any of the species of Buccinum coming under our observation, 

 in being a much thinner shell, and in having, instead of a short reflexed canal 

 or deep notch at the base of the columella, simply a small rounded sinus. 



In form and general appearance it resembles Sulcobuccinum of D'Orbigny, and 

 Pseudoliva, of Swainson ; but differs from them both in its strongly arcuate and 

 tortuous columella, as well as in wanting the revolving sulcus on the exterior 

 of the body whorl. It is also a much thinner shell than we have seen amongst 

 the species of either of these types, and wants the small notch in the outer lip, 

 characteristic of the first, and the projecting spine on the inner side of the same 

 in the other. 



As it is not possible to give definitely the characters of a genus, of which but 

 a single species is known, we will for the present merely repeat a description 

 given on a former occasion of this shell, without attempting to separate the 

 specific characters from those that may be only of specific importance. 



^ PSEUDOBUCCINUM NeBRASCENSIS. 



Buccinum? Nebrascensis, 31. <j- 17., Proceed. Acad. Nat. Sci. Vol. 8, p. 61. 

 Shell oval, thin; spire very short ; volutions three to three and a half, convex, 

 rapidly increasing from the apex, last one very large and somewhat ventricose ; 

 surface marked with distinct lines of growth, which are crossed by flattened 

 revolving bands, much wider on the upper part of the volutions than the shal- 

 low grooves between, but about equalling them on the lower part of the last 

 turn. About seven or eight of these bands may be counted on the second vo- 

 lution ; suture narrow and slightly channeled ; aperture large, subelliptical.

angular above, and terminating in a rather small, rounded sinus below, the 

 form of which is well defined by a sudden curve in the lines of growth on a 

 broad spiral ridge round the edge of the pillar lip ; outer lip very thin ; inner

Xylophaqa elegantula. 



Shell small, globose-cordate, very ventricose ; posterior rounded and closed ; 

 anterior having a profound angular notch in the under part, so as to produce a 

 very large hiatus extending more than one-third the length of the shell back 

 from the buccal extremity, and above the middle; beaks elevated, gibbous, very 

 strongly incurved and placed a little in advance of the middle ; surface orna- 

 mented by small regular concentric wrinkles and very fine lines of growth ; the 

 wrinkles are rather obscure on the posterior part of the shell, but upon reach- 

 ing a narrow sulcus, which passes from the beaks to the base, a little in advance 

 of the middle of the shell, they suddenly become more distinct, and are deflected 

 upwards nearly parallel with the vertical margins of the hiatus, near which they 

 again become very fine and regular; on passing upon that portion of the valves 

 extending out in front over the hiatus, these fine wrinkles are deflected, almost 

 in a horizontal direction, and suddenly enlarged, but rapidly diminish, and 

 converge as they pass round the anterior extremity. 



On the cast, the mesial sulcus extending from the beaks to the base is very 

 narrow but deep and sharply defined. At the points where the concentric 

 wrinkles cross this sulcus or groove, it is distinctly punctate. Further back, a 

 rather distinct carina extends from the back part of the beaks obliquely back- 

 wards and downwards nearly to the base of the shell ; immediately behind 

 this ridge, the posterior part of the cast is suddenly compressed, and faintly 

 marked by a large leaf-like muscular impression. The pallial impression is 

 narrow, stands nearly vertical, and extends more than halfway up to the beaks 

 between the mesial sulcus and posterior carina. 



Locality and position. Muscle shell River, where it was found embedded in 

 fossil-wood, — formation No. 4. 



Xylophaga Stimpsoni. 



Shell ovate, gibbous in front, and cuneate behind ; posterior end obliquely 

 subtruncate above, round below, nearly or quite closed; anterior having a dis- 

 tinct angular notch below, which forms a large hiatus extending back one- 

 fourth the length of the skull and upwards above the middle ; base and dorsal 

 margins parallel ; beaks not much elevated above the dorsal edge, pointed at 

 the apex, and strongly incurved. Surface marked by distinct, regular con- 

 centric wrinkles, and extremely fine lines of growth. The wrinkles are more 

 obscure on the posterior part of the shell, but on crossing a narrow sulcus (in 

 the cast) that passes from the beaks to the base, they become more distinct, 

 and curve gracefully upwards nearly parallel with the edge of the hiatus; on 

 passing forward upon the upper anterior part of the valves extending out over 

 the hiatus, they are suddenly deflected in a horizontal direction and become 

 stronger, but rapidly diminish and converge in passing round the anterior ex- 

 tremity. 



On the cast, the mesial groove extending from the apex of the beaks obliquely 

 downwards and a little backwards to the base, is narrow but well defined. A 

 little in advance of this, and nearly parallel with it, a fainter impressed line 

 passes from the beaks to the base. About halfway between the mesial groove 

 and the posterior end of the shell, another deep, but broader, groove extends 

 from the posterior side of the beaks obliquely backwards nearly to the lower 

 part of the anal extremity; behind this the narrow oval posterior muscular 

 impression is seen faintly indicated near the border. 



Although resembling the last in its style of ornament, this is a very distinct

Species, being ovate in form instead of globose-cordate. It also differs in 

 having greatly less elevated beaks. 



We dedicate the species to Mr. W. Stimpson, Naturalist of the South Pacific 

 Exploring Expedition, to whom we are under obligations for suggestions re- 

 specting this and the preceding species. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Pholadomya subventricosa. 



Shell longitudinally oval, ventricose in the umbonial and buccal regions, 

 more compressed behind ; extremities rounded ; base forming an elliptic curve ; 

 dorsum concave behind the beaks, declining very abruptly in front ; beaks ele- 

 vated, gibbous, located near the anterior end, distinctly incurved ; surface orna- 

 mented by about thirty very small, rather flexuous, radiating costae, some of 

 which die out before reaching the beaks, crossed by faint concentric wrinkles, 

 and fine rather indistinct lines of growth, which produce on the costse very 

 small irregular nodes or granules ; costse most distant near the extremities of 

 the shell, and wanting on an oval or cordate space at the anterior end. Length 

 about 2 inches ; height 1.10 inch ; breadth 1-10 inch. 



This shell resembles very nearly a Lower Green sand species described by 

 Prof. Forbes in the Journ. Geol. Soc. Lond. vol. i. p. 238, pi. 2, fig. 3, under the 

 name of P. Martini; but the beaks are more elevated, and nearer terminal in 

 our shell, and the costae more numerous. The concentric wrinkles likewise 

 differ in being not quite so distinct as on P. llariini. 



It is yet more closely allied to a species described by one of the writers* in 

 Trans, Albany Institute, vol. 4, p. 42, from Vancouver's Island, under the name 

 of P. subelongata ; but has more elevated beaks, and finer, as well as more 

 numerous costfe ; the buccal end is also more gibbous than in P. subelongata. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, formation No. 1 ? of general

SOLEN? DaKOTENSIS. 



Shell long and slender, rather compressed ; dorsal margin and base parallel : 

 posterior end narrowly rounded, (anterior end?); beaks not distinct from the 

 dorsal edge, located near the centre of the shell; surface of cast marked by very 

 obscure traces of concentric wrinkles, indicating the direction of lines of 

 growth. Length 1.40 inch; height .35 inch; breadth about .20 inch. 



This species resembles S. cequalis, D'Orbigny, (Pal. Franc, tom. 3d, pi. 350, 

 figs. 5, 6,) more than any shell with which we are acquainted ; but is propor- 

 tionally narrower, and the beaks are less distinct from the cardinal border. 

 The only specimen we have seen is a cast of the outside of both valves, lyi"g 

 partly open and embedded in the matrix. Although we know nothing of rLe 

 surface markings or interior of this shell, we have ventured to characterize it, 

 believing it important to call attention to the few forms found in the formation 

 in which it occurs, however obscure they may be, as there remains some doubt 

 in regard to the exact age of this deposit. 



Locality and position. Just below the mouth of Vermilion River on the Mis- 

 souri, formation No. 1 of general section. 



New Gen. CORBULAMELLA. 



The small shell upon which we propose to establish the above genus appears 

 to be related both to Cardilia of Deshays, and Corbula of Bruguiere. It differs 

 from the first, however, in being distinctly inequivalve, and in wanting the 

 spoon-shaped projection for the reception of the ligament, mentioned by 

 Deshays. From Corbula it differs in having the posterior muscular attacliment 

 raised upon a thin, strongly projecting plate, as in Cuculloea. The teeth of the 

 hinge, and pallial impression appear to be as in Corbula. We have not been 

 able to determine whether the ligament was internal or external. 



* Mr. Meek. 



[May, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 143 



As this shell appears to agree in so many characters with Corlula, the pro- 

 priety of separating it from that genus may be doubted by some; it presents, 

 however, such a marked difference from any species of Corbula we have seen, in 

 the peculiar very strongly projecting internal plate above referred to, that we 

 are satisfied there nmst have been some corresponding difference in the organi- 

 zation of the animal. 



As we have hitherto met with but the one species, it is of course impossible 

 to determine, in every instance, which of its characters are of specific, and which 

 of generic importance, consequently we will not attempt to give a formal 

 diagnosis of the genus, but will merely repeat, with slight modifications, the 

 description given by us some little time back in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy. 



CORBULAMELLA QREGAREA. 



Corbula ? gregarea^ M. ^ JT., Proceed. Acad. Nat. Set. Vol. viii, ^;. 84. 



Shell very small, inequivalve, approaching subglobose, a triangular form, 

 right valve more ventricose than the other ; beaks nearly central, gibbous, that 

 of the right valve elevated above the left, incurved ; surface polished and 

 marked with a few faint irregular concentric wrinkles of growth ; hinge having 

 under the beak a single prominent tooth in each valve ; anterior muscular 

 attachment rather indistinct, posterior raised upon a strongly projecting

 slightly truncate ; base semi-ovate or broadly rounded ; dorsal margin sloping 

 rather abruptly, with a regular convex curve from the beaks to the posterior 

 end, concave and much more abruptly' declining in front ; beaks rather elevated, 

 slightly gibbous, located a little in advance of the middle of the shell. Length 

 .95 inch ; height .80 inch ; breadth .53 inch. 



This species has much the form and general appearance of a Cytherea, but as 

 there is no indication of a sinus in the pallial impression, on any of the casts 

 we have seen, and the teeth of the hinge, as near as can be ascertained from 

 internal cast, are like those of Cyprina^ we place it provisionally in that genus. 



Locality and position. Big Sioux River, two miles above the mouth, in sand- 

 stone of formation No. 1, where it is associated with fragments of fossil wood 

 bored by Teredo. 



Cyprina cordata. 



Shell thick, cordate, gibbous ; extremities and base rounded ; umbonial region 

 ventricose ; beaks much elevated, nearly central, distinctl}' curved obliquelj'^ 

 inwards and forwards ; muscular impressions not very deep, surface marked by 

 strong concentric lines, and small wrinkles of growth, crossed by faint traces 

 of radiating lines. Length 1.66 inches ; height 1.68 inches ; breadth about 1.49 

 inches. 



As we have not yet seen the hinge of this shell, we are in some doubt in 

 regard to its affinities ; and only place it provisionally in the genus Cyprina. 

 The character of the muscular impressions, with its simple pallial line, and gen- 

 eral appearances, are such as to indicate its relations to that genus. It will be 

 at once distinguished from all the other forms we have yet seen from the Ne- 

 braska rocks, by its high curved beaks, gibbous cordate form, and distinct lines 

 of growth ; the radiating lines mentioned above are so ver}' faint as to be readily 

 overlooked, excepting when the shell is viewed in a certain light, and may be 

 often absent. 



Locality and position. Moreau River, No. 5 of the series.

Cyprina compressa. 



Shell broad ovate, rather thin and compressed, somewhat narrowly rounded 

 at the extremities, base semi-oval ; beaks elevated, approximate, not strongly 

 curved, located about three-eighths the length of the shell back of the 

 anterior end ; cardinal border declining rather abruptly, with a greatly con- 

 vex outline, from the beaks towards the posterior end, concave and mere abrupt- 

 before the beaks ; surface unknown ; muscular impressions rather distinct. 

 Length 2.66 inches; height 2.1Y inches; breadth about 1.15. 



We are not sure we have seen specimens of this species showing the surface 

 characters; some fragments in the collection from the same locality and position 

 apparently of the same shell, are simply marked with rather strong lines of 

 growth. It is barely possible this may be a variety of the last ; the beaks, how- 

 ever, are so much more elevated, and farther removed from the anterior end, 

 that we are at present inclined to regard it as a distinct species. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Cyprina subtumida. 



Shell rather small, ovate, moderately gibbous ; anterior end narrowly round- 

 ed below the beaks ; posterior subtruncate at the extremity ; base forming a 

 gently convex curve, contracted towards the posterior ; cardinal border de- 

 clining with a long gentle curve from the beaks to the posterior end, concave 

 and very abrupt in front ; beaks located near the anterior end, directed ob- 

 liquely forward, not much elevated ; umbonial region gibbous ; valves prominent 

 or almost subangular from near the beaks obliquely backwards towards the lower 

 part of the posterior end ; muscular impressions not deep, anterior ones smaller 

 and more distinct than the others; surface unknown. Length (of cast) -92 

 inch ; height -65 inch ; breadth -55 inch. 



This species is not very nearly related to any we have seen figured in foreign 

 works, and may be known from any of those we have described from the North 

 West, excepting C. cordata, by its more gibbous form, more ventricose and 

 oblique umbonial slopes, as well as less elevated beaks. From C. cordata it 

 will be at once distinguished by its ovate form and greatly less elevated beaks. 



Our specimens do not show very satisfactorily the surface markings, as the 

 exterior has been mainly removed by the exfoliation of the shell. There are, 

 however, indications of lines of growth, and on the surfaces of the laminae 

 faint traces of radiating mai'ks ; though the latter may have had no connection 

 with surface markings. Not enough of the shell remains to show the character 

 of the points of the beaks. 



Locality and position. Yellow Stone River, in beds apparently a blending of 

 No. 4 and 5. 



Cyprina ovata. 



Shell ovate, compressed, rather thin, somewhat narrowly rounded at the 

 extremities ; base semi-ovate ; cardinal border declining with a gentle curve 

 from the beaks towards the posterior extremity, concave and sloping more 

 abruptly in front ; beaks not much elevated, rather small, approximate, not 

 strongly curved, located a little more than one-fourth the length of the 

 shell behind the anterior border; surface ornamented by distinct concentric 

 lines of growth ; lunule small, and not distinctly defined ; corselet lanceolate, 

 profound; hinge moderately thick, lateral teeth long ; cardinal teeth not very 

 prominent ; muscular and pallial impressions distinct, but not deep. Length 

 2-55 inches ; height 2-05 inches; breadth 1-15 inches. 



This species resembles C. oblonya, D'Orbigny, (Pal. Franc, torn. 3d, p. 105, 

 pi. 277, fig. 1-4,) but is more narrowly rounded at the extremities, and the 

 lateral tooth of the right valve is not near so prominent. 



Locality and position. Mouth Heart River, at junction of formation No. 5 of 

 the general section with the base of the Tertiary, but probably in the former.

Unio Danai. 



Shell elongate, arcuate, and oblique, contracting posteriorly ; anterior end 

 regularly rounded; base slightly arched, most contracted a liltle behind the 

 middle ; posterior end cuneate, rather narrowly rounded ; dorsal margin slop- 

 ing with a long convex curve from near the umbones towards the posterior 

 end ; beaks depressed, not very distinct from the dorsal edge, placed a little more 

 than one-fourth tlie length of the shell from the anterior end; flanks concave 

 from the umbonial region obliquely downwards to the most arcuate portion of 

 the base ; liinge moderately thick; cardinal teeth corrugated, strong, apparently 

 double in the left valve, and single in the right; lateral teeth long and slender : 

 surface (of specimens with the epidermis removed) marked by faint lines of 

 growth, and very obscure radiating stria;. Length 3-50 inches ; height 1'54 

 inches; breadth about 1 inch. 



After satisfying ourselves that this and the two following species are distinct 

 from all the fossil Uniones described in any works within our reach, we sub- 

 mitted them to Mr. Isaac Lea, tlie well-known conchologist of Philadelphia, from 

 whom we received the following remarks respecting their affinities to recent 

 species. 



" The specimen marked Unio Danai has very much the same outline with 

 Margarilina margaritifera^ Schm., but is a true Unio, and perhaps more nearly 

 allied to U. lumidus, Retzius, than to any other of the genus. It is certainly an 

 undescribed species. 



" Unio Deiceyanus is a very distinct species, and although not more than half 

 the size, very closely resembles the recent U. ^rwwca^Ms, Swainson, in outline and 

 obliqueness. It is also, like it, a thick ponderous species. 



" Unio subspalulaius is an oblique species, nearly allied to U. spatulalus, Lea. 

 but is more rounded posteriorly than that shell. 



" All these species are characterized by an obliqueness not usual in the genus. 

 The beaks are nearly terminal in all of them, and they have a general massive 

 character, which causes a disposition to enlarged cardinal and lateral teeth. 

 This enlargement is more particularly noticeable in the cardinal teeth, which 

 are all massive and very much corrugated. It is evident from the deep cor- 

 rugations of the great cicatrices, that the muscular power of the animal was 

 very great. 



" They are certainly very interesting specimens, and deserve attention, as they 

 differ much from the general type of recent Uniones, as well as those of tlie 

 Wealden of England." 



Owing to the fact that these shells were obtained from a formation in which 

 saurian remains, similar to some of those of the Wealden were found, we 

 called Mr. Lea's attention to that fact, with the view of also obtaining his 

 opinion respecting their affinities to Wealden forms. From his remarks above, 

 it will be seen he is of the opinion they are distinct from the types of that epoch. 

 Mr. Lea's opinion on this point is of much value, since he had an opportunity, 

 while in England some years since, of studying very carefully Dr. ManteU's ex- 

 tensive collection of Wealden species. 



We name this shell in honor of Prof. James D. Dana, the distinguished 

 naturalist of New Haven, Connecticut. 



Localitji and posilion. Mouth of Judith River, bed G. of the freshwater and 

 estuary deposits at that locality. 



Unio Deweyanus. 



Shell rather thick, oblique, narrow-ovate, approaching a narrow-elliptic 

 form, most convex in the umbonial region, more compressed and cuneate poste- 

 riorly; extremities rounded, anterior end a little wider than the otiier ; base 

 broad, semi-ovate ; dorsal margin nearly straight, and sloping gradually from 

 near the beaks towards the posterior end ; beaks small, not very distinct from 

 the dorsal border, almost terminal in old shells, but iu young individuals a

little more removed from the buccal margin ; surface (of specimens with the 

 epidermis wanting) showing obscure lines of growth, crossed by very fine in- 

 distinct irregular radiating striee ; ligament long ; hinge much thickened at the 

 anterior end of the valves, composed of two rough irregular cardinal teeth in 

 the left valve, and one more prominent tooth in the right ; lateral teeth long 

 and slightly arched ; dorsal cicatrix located nearly under the beaks, not very 

 deep ; anterior cicatrix distinct, and strongly corrugated ; cavity of the beaks 

 shallow. Length about 2-60 inches; height 1-33 inches; breadth about 1-18 

 inches. 



Named in honor of Rev. Chester Dewey, of Rochester University. 



Locality and position. Bed G. of the freshwater and estuary formations at 

 the mouth of Judith River. (See section at that place.) 



Unio subspatdlata. 



Shell moderately thick, oblique, elongate-ovate, rather compressed, most con- 

 vex at the anterior end, cuneate behind ; buccal end wider than the other, 

 abruptly rounded or subtruncate; posterior end narrowly rounded ; base nearly 

 straight or very slightly concave ; dorsal margin sloping a little, with a long, 

 convex curve from near the umbone?, towards the posterior end; beaks small, 

 not much elevated, located at the anterior end ; surface (epidermis gone) show- 

 ing faint lines of growth, crossed by fine irregular, radiating striae; hinge and 

 interior unknown. Length 2-83 inches ; height 1-34 inches ; breadth -75 inch. 



This species is related to U. Danai of this paper, but is more compressed, and 

 its base and flanks are less contracted. It likewise presents the well marked 

 difi'erence of having terminal beaks, while those of U. Danai are removed 

 about one-fourth the length of the shell back from the anterior end. 



From TJ. Dcwcijanus of this paper, to which it is also related, it differs in 

 being more elongated and compressed. It is also more arched on the back and 

 more contracted along the lower border. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Pectunculus subimbrioatus. 



Shell transversely oval, nearly circular, not much compressed, equilateral ; 

 extremities rounded, posterior end sometimes slightly broader than the other : 

 base rather more broadly rounded ; cardinal border slightly arched, moderately 

 thick ; beaks (obtuse?) not much elevated or incurved ; surface ornamented by 

 about fifty simple, rounded, depressed radiating plications, a little more than 

 twice a« broad as the grooves between, crossed by numerous regular, distinct, 

 imbricating lines of growth, which arch upwards in crossing the costse ; 

 cardinal teeth about twenty-five, not large, lateral ones arcuate, with the con- 

 cave sides turned from the beaks ; ligament area moderate, marked by about 

 six grooves, which form very obtuse angles under the beaks ; muscular im- 

 pressions large but not deep. Length 1-49 inches ; height 1-36 inches ; breadth 

 1-02 inches. 



Associated with the above we have a single valve of another individual not 

 more than one-sixth as large, and having comparatively a smaller ligament 

 area, fewer teeth and rather less prominent beaks. The costse are also ap- 

 parently obsolete over proportionably larger spaces at the extremities of the 

 hinge. This we suspect may be a distinct species, but without more specimens 

 for comparison we are unwilling to so regard it at present. If it should prove 

 to be a different species we would suggest for it the name of P. suborbiculatus. 



Locality and position. Heart River, near junction of No. 5 with the Tertiary, 

 but perhaps in the former. 



OSTREA GLABllA.

 times to the right; generally narrower near the beaks than at the other ex-

tremity. Lower valve rather deep ; ligament area small and well defined ; 

 beaks somewhat pointed at the extremity, most frequently turned abruptly to 

 the left; umbonial region sometimes a little distorted by the cicatrix of at- 

 tachment. Upper valve flat, or a little concave ; beak truncated at the ex- 

 tremity. Surface smooth, or only marked by very small, faint concentric wrinkles 

 of growth. Length about 3 inches ; breadth 1-50 to 2 inches. 



Locality and position. Mouth of Judith River, in sandstone of formation No. 1 ? 

 of general section. 



OSTREA TRANSIiCCIDA. 



Shell small, thin and translucent, arcuate, attached by the under side of the 

 lower valve in the umbonial region ; border having faint indications of three or 

 four broad undefined plications ; beaks small, more or less distinctly curved to 

 the left ; lower valve convex, rather deep ; ligament area very small and 

 triangular, sometimes linear and abruptly curved to the left ; margins on 

 each side of the beak regularly and rather distinctly crenulated ; muscular impres- 

 sion ovate, small, very near the left border, indistinct ; upper valve nearly flat, 

 or slightly concave near the middle, sometimes distinctly alate on the left side 

 at the beak, regularly and closely rounded on the other side; cardinal end 

 transversely truncate ; beak not extending beyond the truncated cardinal edge, 

 but curving round to the left within the margin ; surface nearly smooth, or 

 marked only by faint subimbricating lines of growth. Length about 1 inch; 

 breadth -53 inch ; depth of lower valve '30 inch. 



This species resembles 0. larva of Lamarck, and is the shell referred by ns 

 with doubt to that species in the catalogue of Nebraska Cretaceous and Ter- 

 tiary fossils given in our last paper. A comparison of better specimens in the 

 late collections, with authentic specimens of 0. larva proves them to be quite 

 distinct. Our shell never being near so distinctly plicated round the border as 

 that species, nor is it auriculate on both sides of the beak as in 0. larva. Its 

 mode of attachment is likewise altogether different, being more like 0. crenulata 

 of Tuomey, in that respect; it also sometimes resembles the latter shell in the 

 crenulate character of its borders on each side of the beaks, but differs in want- 

 ing the closely plaited squaniose ridges mentioned by Prof. Tuomey. 



Locality and position. Long Lake on the Missouri, in the upper part of No. 5 

 of the section. 



HeMIASTER ? HUMPHREYSANUS. 



Shell broad cordate or subcircular, rather depressed, greatest elevation near 

 the posterior, declining very slightly towards the front; broadest a little in 

 advance of the middle, rather flat below ; oral aperture, not large, transversely 

 oval, arcuate, with convex side towards the front, located about one-fourth the 

 length of the shell from the anterior end ; vent small and of an oval form ; api- 

 cal disc not more than one-third the length of the shell in advance of the 

 posterior end : genital pores four, rather large ; dorsal ambulacra, excepting 

 the odd one, distinctly petialoid, very unequal ; anterior or odd one long, 

 lanceolate, and extending nearly to the margin, located in a deep rounded 

 groove which passes over the front to the mouth, giving an emarginate cha- 

 racter to the anterior end, having about thirty-three pairs of pores in each 

 series ; anterior lateral ambulacra flexures a little broader than, and not quite so 

 long as, the odd one, placed in distinct grooves, and having about thirty-five or 

 six pairs of pores in each series ; posterior ambulacra very small, not much more 

 than one- third as long as the anterior laterals, oval in form, and having about 

 eighteen pairs of pores in each series, not deeply excavated ; inter-ambulacral 

 spaces prominent, anterior two rather pinched up ; surface unknown. Lent'th 

 1-21 inch; height -81 inch ; breadth 1*20 inch. 



Not having seen specimens showing the surface markings of this species, it is 

 with some doubt we refer it to the genus Uemiaster, the absence of the shell

leaving some doubts in regard to the presence of the fasciale characteristics of 

 that genus. The posterior position of the apical disc, and the close proximity 

 of mouth to the front, as well as the great inequality of the posterior and anterior 

 lateral ambulacra, appear to remove it from the genus Toxaster. In some re- 

 spects it resembles the genus Schizaster, but does not decline so distinctly to- 

 wards the front above, as is common amongst the species of that genus. It may 

 belong to a new type. 



It is remarkable, that in all the collections hitherto obtaiued from the 

 Cretaceous rocks of Nebraska, this is the only species of Echinodi-nn yet 

 met with, and it is so rare that but the single specimen now before us, and a 

 fragment mentioned in one of our former papers, from the same locality, have 

 been met with. 



We take pleasure in naming this rare and beautiful fossil in honor of 

 Capt. A. A. Humphreys, of the U. S. Topographical Engineers. 



Locality and position. Yellow Stone River, in a bed composed of a blending 

 of No. 4 and 5 of the general section. 



On the LABVA of the Thyreus Abbottii. 

 BY J. P. KIRTLAND, M. D. 



Swainson, in his Zoological Illustrations, vol. i. First Series, described the 

 Thyreus Abbottii, which, together with the Pupa and Larva, he figured on the 

 authority of Mr. Abbott's unpublished drawings. 



Dr. Harris' Catalogue of North American Sphinges, in the Amer. Jour, of 

 .Sciences and Arts, vol. xxxvi., contains also a description of this larva, drawn 

 from Swainson's sketch. With due deference to these high authorities, I beg 

 leave to state, that neither their figures nor descriptions bears the least re- 

 semblance to the true larva. 



During the last three years I have reared many of them and carried them 

 through the second stages of transformation to the perfect insect. 



At maturity the Larva is about the length of Swainson's figure, but its 

 diameter is one-fifth less. Its upper surface is ash color, with its belly and 

 legs tinged with a faint violet. It is not furnished with a caudal horn as repre- 

 sented in Swainson's figure, but in place of it has an oval eyelet or occuli, of a 

 glossy brown color, and a line or two in diameter. This Larva resembles more 

 the common silk worm (Bombyx mori) than it does Swainson's figure. Its 

 principal food is the leaf of the Ampelopsis quinquefolia, though it occasionally 

 is found on the cultivated grape vine. 



During the month of August it attains its full size, and individuals may be 

 seen at night descending to the ground, where it enters the pupae state, below 

 the reach of frost. 



Specimens kept in boxes of earth beneath the shelves of a warm green house, 

 appeared in the perfect state as early as the first of April, while those pre- 

 served in a cool cellar did not assume that form till late in May, or early in 

 June. 



That Dr. Harris was led into an error by Swainson's figure I have no doubt, 

 for Dr. H. sent me a drawing and colored figure of this true Larva four years 

 since, requesting of me information as to the perfect insect it produced. To 

 prevent a further extension of that error is the object of this communication.

Description of two new genera of Shells, and Rectification of 

 some of the generic names of American Tertiary Fossils, by T. A. 

 Conrad. 



Which as usual were referred to committees. 



Dr. Leidy remarked t'.iat upon one of the specimens of coal shales with fossil 

 fishes, from Linton, Jefferson Co., Ohio, presented this evening by Mr. Wheatley, 

 there was a compressed oval, black, shining, brittle, homogeneous mass, 

 about three inches long, and one inch and a quarter wide, by two lines in 

 thickness, which he suspected to be the ink bag of a Loligo, or cuttle-fish. 

 The carbonaceous mass can readily be reduced to an impalpable powder, which 

 has the same appearance and color as that derived from the fossil Loligo of the 

 Lias of Wiirtemburg. 



Mr. Lea exhibited two specimens from the dark slates of the Red 

 Sandstone of Phoenixville, Pa., which had been procured by Mr. 

 Wheatley from the tunnel of the Reading Railroad. These specimens 

 contained a hone and a coproUte, and through the mass could be 

 observed imperfect portions of the so-called Posidonia, which has 

 been found usually wherever these black slates occur. The bone 

 is fractured at both ends, is nearly four inches long and three-quarters 

 by nearly half an inch thick. It is flattened on the outside and curved 

 on the inner side. The transverse section nearly resembles that which, 

 as the fore-arm or leg, Mr. Lea figured in the Journal, N. S., vol. ii., 

 pi. 18, fig. 1, under the name of Clepsj/saurus Pennsylvanicns, and it 

 may be identical with that species ; or it may belong to that of Cente- 

 modon sulcatus, Lea, which was described in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy in April of last year, from a single tooth, and which he found 

 within a few hundred yards of the same locality, at the northern end 

 of the same tunnel. This is another evidence among the very few in 

 Pennsylvania of the existence of Saurian life at the period of this in- 

 teresting Red Sandstone formation. The specimen of coprolite is 

 more perfect than any Mr. Lea had seen from the same locality, and 

 was probably one of the ejectamenta of this Saurian.

Dr. B. CoATES in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy remarked that the specimens of coprolites and shales with Fost- 

 donice, and the left dental bone of a fish presented by Mr. Conrad and himself 

 this evening, had been obtained in a recent visit to Black Tunnel, near Phoenix- 



1857.] 11 




150 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



ville, Chester Co. The Posidonice Mr. Conrad regards as identical with the 

 P. multicostata and P. triangularis of Prof. Emmons, obtained from a corres- 

 ponding geological formation of Chatham Co., N. C* The former species had 

 been previously indicated by Mr. Lea under the name of P. ovata-f from speci- 

 mens obtained at Phoenixville, and probably the latter was also indicated under 

 the name oi P.parva from smaller specimens than those presented this evening, 

 but likewise obtained from the same locality. 



The dental bone referred to, apparently belongs to a ganoid fish, probably 

 allied to Eugnathus or Belonosiomus. 



Dr. L. further observed that Prof. Emmons had recently discovered the re- 

 mains of an insectivorous mammal in the same series of rocks of Chatham Co., 

 X. C.{ The animal, Dromatherium sylvestre, is closely allied to the Spalacothe- 

 rium, Owen, from the English Purbeck beds of the oolitic series, and it may pro- 

 bably indicate that the rocks in which it was found, with those corresponding 

 in this State, may be of the same age as those of the Richmond coal field. 



The Clepsysaurvs, Lea, of the same rocks of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, 

 is not properly a thecodent reptile, but may form the type of a new family, as 

 its teeth are inserted in the jaw by solid conical fangs. Omosaurus of the same 

 formations is probably a distinct genus from Clepsysaurus.

 respondent of the Academy.

Examination of Enargite, from New Grenada, by W. J. Taylor. 



Which were referred to Committees. 



Dr. Leidy read a letter fom Dr. J. S. Newberry, dated Washington, 



D. C., May 4, 1857, desiring that the title Mekolepis, applied by him 

 to a genus of fossil fish, be changed to Eurylepis, the former having been 

 anticipated by Dumeril and Bibron. The species would then read 

 Eurylepis corrugatus ; E. tuherculatus ; E. gramdahis ; E. lineatus ; 



E. ovoideus J E. 07'natissimus ; E. insculptus ; E. scrratus. 



Dr. Leidy exhibited specimens of New Red Sandstone fossils from 

 near the Gwyned tunnel, on the North Pennsylvania Railroad, collected 

 by Mr. Lea and himself. These are species of Cypris, very numerous, 

 some scales of Ganoid fishes, and remains of bones and teeth, probably 

 Batrachian. 



Dr. Morris called the attention of the Academy to some fishes kept 

 in a vase where water was not removed frequently enough ; the fishes 

 then rise at short intervals to the surface and swallow air, thus main- 

 taining their respiration ; showing that the exchange of gases in this 

 class of animals takes place readily as long as the branchiae are kept 

 moist, and illustrating the mode of respiration in the genus Anabas.

 Mr. Ord, President, in the Chair. 



Mr. Yaux read a letter from Mr. John Biddle, dated June 11th, 

 1857, accompanying the crania of Thugs presented this evening. 



My late brother-in-law Wm. A. Foster, in 1836 (at which time we were both 

 residing in Calcutta) applied to Dr. Martin, E. I. Co.'s Surgeon, and the leading 

 physician of that city, to procure for him the skulls of some Thugs. Dr. M. did 

 not succeed in obtaining them until the latter part of 1837, at which time Mr. 

 F. had left India for the United States. As I was still there. Dr. M. sent them 

 to me for Jlr. F., and I shipped the lot, consisting of six, to Philadelphia. On 

 their arrival, Mr. F. was absent from the United States, and had transferred 

 them to me. 



Dr. Martin, in his note accompanying them, stated that they were the heads 

 of notorious Thugs, who had recently been hung by direction of the Court for 

 the suppression of Thuggee established by the E. I. Co. ; and I entertain no 

 doubt of the correctness of his statement. 



As to the province of Hindoostan, to which the birth place of these six Thugs 

 should be referred, Dr. M. said nothing, and probably knew nothing. Neither 

 did he inform me in which district they were tried and executed; but at the 

 period at which he procured them, Thuggee was practised much more exten- 

 sively in the region about the head waters of the Ganges than in the province 

 of Bengal; and I presume that they were obtained from the former region. 



Two of the six skulls were sent by me to our late friend Dr. Samuel G. 

 Morton, in W. A. Foster's name. I suppose them to be the same which appear 

 in the Catalogue of Crania belonging to the Academy. Two others I presented 

 to George Combe, of Scotland, when on a visit to our city, many years ago; 

 and the remaining two you now have.

Notes on the Geology of the Mauvaises Terres of White River, Nebraska. 



BY F. V. HAYDEN, M. D. 



This interesting lacustrine deposit has but recently been made known to the 

 scientific world, — wonderful not alone for its unique scenery, but also for the 

 abundance and importance of its organic remains ; and although it has been 

 as yet but partially explored, the results that have been obtained have proved 

 of the highest interest. The profusion of Mammalian and Chelonian remains

water origin and remarkable physical features, must render it, when fully 

 explored and studied, classic ground to the Geologist and Palaeontologist. I 

 now propose to give a brief account of the histoiy and progress of its discovery, 

 note the different expeditions which have visited it, and present, in as short a 

 compass as possible, what is now known respecting its geology. The history 

 of its esploi-ation up to 1853 I quote from Prof. Leidy's great work, "The 

 Ancient Fauna of Nebraska." 



" This extensive cemetery of eocene vertebrata in the Mauvaises Terres, or 

 Bad Lands, was first brought to our notice in a communication entitled, ^Dt- 

 scription of a fossil Maxillary Bone of a Palceotherium from near White River ^ pub- 

 lished by Hiram A. Front, M. D., of St. Louis, in the American Journal of Science 

 and Arts for 1847, page 248.' 



"Nearly at the same time Mr. S. D. Phillips, when on a visit to Chambers- 

 burgh, observed in the possession of Dr. S. JD. Culbertson, several remarkable 

 mammalian fossils, which had been sent as curiosities from the Bad Lands by 

 his nephew, Mr. Alexander Culbertson, of the American Fur Company. These 

 specimens, at the suggestion of the late distinguished Dr. S. G. Morton, were 

 obtained through Dr. John H. B. McClelland, a friend of Dr. Culbertson, and 

 were obligingly placed in my hands for examination. A description of them 

 was published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 

 delphia for 1847 and 1848, and they were afterward presented by Alexander 

 Culbertson to the Academy. 



" The attention of Dr. D. D. Owen having been directed to the interesting 

 reo-ion whence the fossils were obtained, he requested Dr. John Evans, an as- 

 sistant in the Geological Survey in which he was engaged, to pay it a visit. 

 This gentleman brought home a magnificent collection of fossils, which form 

 the basis of one of the chapters in Dr. Owen's Report.* 



" Through the instrumentality of Prof. S. F. Baird, who from the first fully 

 appreciated the importance of a complete examination of the Mauvaises Terres. 

 and their animal remains, Mr. Thaddeus A. Culbertson, under the auspiees of 

 the Smithsonian Institution, visited the locality and brought home a valuable 

 additional collection of Mammalian and Chelonian fossils. "f 



In the spring of 1853, Dr. John Evans, U. S. Geologist, made an incidental 

 tour to the Bad Lands, while on his way to his field of labors in Oregon, and 

 obtained a very large and valuable collection; and besides re-collecting most of 

 the forms already discovered, added five new species to the Fauna. 



At the same time another expedition was fitted out and sent to the Bad 

 Lands through the liberality of Prof. James Hall, the eminent Geologist and 

 Palaeontologist of New York; and Mr. F. B. Meek and the writer were employed 

 by him to perform the trip. A large and valuable collection and much informa- 

 tion were obtained, adding greatly to our knowledge of the country. Three new 

 species of mammals were also added to the Nebraska Fauna. 



In February, 1855, while spending the winter at Fort Pierre, the writer made 

 a tour to the Bad Lands, under the patronage of Col. A. J. Vaughan, U. S. 

 Agent for the Upper Missouri Indians. A severe storm of snow, however, 

 rendered it impossible for him to go beyond Sage Creek. A few mammalian 

 remains and a fine collection of the fresh-water fossils fi'om Pinao's Spring 

 were the only results. In May of the same year the writer made a second trip 

 by a route never before taken by travellers. Leaving Fort Pierre, he took u 

 south-easterly course, struck White River about thirty miles above its mouth, 

 crossed the stream and ascended to the dividing ridge which overlooks the 

 valley of Running Water, on the south side of White River and the main body 

 of the Bad Lands. An opportunity was thus given to examine the outliers and 

 upper beds of the Bad Lands, ivhich resulted in the discovery of several new

 family Rodentia,* a group not before discovered in this basin. A line oppor- 

 tunity was thus given to trace the connection of distant outliers on both sides 

 of the Missouri, with the main body of the Bad Lands at the head of White and 

 Shyenne rivers.

 the diflerent beds at the various localities examined, premising, however, that 

 the thickness of the strata are all estimated. The section, therefore, cannot be

 interesting region.

154 PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



In making some general remarks in regard to the geology of the Bad Lands, 

 I propose to take Fort Pierre as the starting point, pass up the valley of the 

 Teton River to its source, and over the Plateau, skirting the northern side of 

 the Bad Lands, enter the basin at Bear Creek, cross White River near Ash 

 Grove Spring, and descend the valley of White River on the south side of the 

 Bad Lands, below its confluence with the Missouri to Bijou Hills. 



Leaving Fort Pierre, on our route to the Bad Lands, we take a course a little 

 south of west along the valley drained by the Teton River and its tributaries. 

 This region is underlaid by Formation* No. 4 of the Cretaceous system. The 

 surface is quite undulating, presenting the usual indications of sterility, with 

 verylittlf to break themonotony of the scenery until reaching Grindstone Hills, 

 about eighty miles from our starting point, where a new feature presents itself. 

 These hills strike the eye of the traveller on account of their peculiar form, 

 heighth and the immense ledges of rock that cap their summits. These rocks 

 present an exceedingly variable structure. Some are formed of an aggregation 

 of quartz fragments cemented with carbonate of lime ; others form a coarse- 

 grained sandstone, or a conglomerate of water-worn pebbles mixed with angular 

 grains of quartz. This bed is undoubtedly an outlier of the Tertiary formations 

 of the Bad Lands. Underneath is the yellow arenaceous bed No. 5 of the Creta- 

 ceous system, and underlying this is No. 4, with its peculiar concretions and 

 a few fossils. Scattered through the valley of the little stream that flows at 

 the base of the hills are slabs of Tertiary limestone containing fresh-water 

 shells of the genera Limnea, Pla7iorbis, &c. On ascending the hills, the lofty 

 spires of the Bad Lands first rise to view like a magnificent city imprinted on 

 the sky. At the head of Teton River the Cretaceous bed No. 5 becomes qiiite 

 conspicuous, attaining a thickness of about eighty feet. Very few fossils are 

 found in it at this locality. I succeeded in finding a single shell and the tooth 

 of a fish, and Mr. Meek discovered in 1853 tracks of Planarian worms. Here 

 the country changes fi'om dreary sterility, with poor water and grass, to a 

 cheerful aspect, fine springs, and a comparatively luxuriant vegetation. 



Ascending the high hills at this point, we pass over the broad Plateau along 

 side of the Bad Lands, their lofty pyramids rising high above the surrounding 

 prairie. Eight miles farther we come to Pinao's Spring, a noted camping place 

 for travellers. Near this place a ridge extends from the Bad Lands across the 

 prairie toward the head of opening creek, about thirty feet in height, its sides 

 gently sloping and covered with grass. Scattered over this ridge are numerous 

 thin slabs of whitish limestone with fresh water shells, which have been changed 

 into a semitransparent chalcedony. There are also concretionary masses of 

 argillaceous limestone fully charged with these fossils in a fine state of pre- 

 servation. These fossils were first discovered by Drs. Evans and Shumard in 

 1853, and have been indicated by them in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia 

 Academy. They consist of Planorbis, Limnea, Physa and a small crustacean. 

 Several undescribed species have since been obtained from this locality, also a 

 few teeth and jaws of Mammals, comminuted remains of fishes, and the seeds 

 of a small species of Chara. The discovery of these fossils afforded us positive 

 evidence of the lacustrine character of this deposit. 



This ridge forms bed D of the vertical section, and is composed mainly of 

 yellow and light yellow calcareous marl. 



Approaching Sage creek the country becomes exceedingly broken. The Cre- 

 taceous bed No. 5 forms numerous pyramidal hills, some of them with almost 

 vertical sides, their summits paved with well water- worn pebbles from the Drift. 

 In the channel of Sage creek the Cretaceous bed No. 4 makes its appearance, 

 and forms a remarkable locality for its peculiar fossils. Continuing our west- 

 erly course, we come to Bear creek, the usual camping place of visitors to the

the Acauemy for May, 1857.

Bad Lands. Passing over the deep valley formed by this stream, we again as- 

 cend to a broad plateau which slopes gently away northward to the valley ot 

 the Shyenne. In the west the lofty range of the Black Hills is seen about sixty 

 miles distant, like a black cloud looming up above the horizon. Turning to the 

 left we descend about fifty feet into the basin of the Bad Lands, a large area 

 worn out as it were by the long continued action of atmosi)heric agencies, the 

 material having been carried away by Bear creek and another tributary of the- 

 Shyenne. After making our descent we pass over a portion of this denuded area 

 two or three miles in width, which is studded with low conical hills, on the 

 sides and at the base of which are numerous dull reddish silico-argillaceous 

 concretions, having much the shape and appearance of huge turtles. From these 

 concretions Messrs. Hall and Meek have described a remarkable Baculite, (B. 

 grandis,) a true Cretaceous fossil, the position of which is in the upper portioii 

 of a bed upon which the lowest stratum of the Tertiary basin of the Bad Lands 

 rests. 



Pursuing from thence a south-westerly course, we commence a gradual as- 

 cent and pass the junction of the two great Geological systems, the Cretaceous 

 and Tertiary, into the Titanotherium bed, the lowest member of this Tertiary 

 basin. We have, first, an ash-colored silico-argillaceous stratum with a green- 

 ish tinge, interspersed with large aggregated masses of particles of quartz, 

 passing up into a light gray calcareous grit. In my vertical section I have con- 

 cluded to throw all these strata, though presenting some lithological differences, 

 into one bed, from the fact that the remains of the huge Pachyderm that has 

 given it its name, are distributed to a greater or less extent all through it. T( 

 the Titanotherium may now be added another pachyderm discovered by the 

 writer in 1855, and described by Dr. Leidy under the name of Hyopotamiits ame- 

 ricanus. 



Passing over a nearly level denuded area about five miles in width, underlaid 

 by this bed, he came to the Turtle and Oreodon bed, so called from the im- 

 mense numbers of the remains of these animals found in it. This forms the 

 lower member of bed B of the vertical section, and is by far the most fossil- 

 iferous portion of the Bad Lands. Besides the remains of Oreodon and Testudo, 

 which are most abundant, many other species of vertebrates have been described 

 by Dr. Leidy from this bed. They are found in the debris on the denuded 

 plateau, or at the base of the Bluifs, and from the nearly perpendicular wall? 

 the Turtles often project like large colored concretions. Some of the Turtles 

 are of large size, measuring four feet in length and three to three and a half 

 feet in width. The most abundant species of Mammal appears to have been 

 the Oreodon Gidbertsonii, of which fragments of more than five hundred indi- 

 viduals have already been obtained from an area not over five miles square, 

 surrounding Ash Grove Spring, which is near the central portion of the Bad 

 Lands. 



The scenery is of the most remarkable and picturesque character. No 

 vegetation meets the eye, but on every side are high bare whitened walls, 

 and the traveller winds his way through these labyrinthine passages as 

 if in the gloomy apartments of some oriental sepulchre. Continuing our ascent, 

 we come to the dividing ridge between the Shyenne and White rivers, ranging 

 north-east and south-west through the central portion of the Bad Lands, in 

 which the little tributaries of these two rivers take their rise. Here the Turtle 

 and Titanotherium beds are concealed, and the upper members of this deposit 

 are well exhibited. Descending the slope toward White River the Turtle bed 

 again appears, and in the channel of White River a stratum of fine gray grit is 

 seen, the upper portion of the bed containing bones of Titanotherium Prouti. 

 Crossing White River we pass down the south side of the main body of the 

 Bad Lands, and find that on this side the beds consist mostly of outliers holding 

 a higher geological position than those at Bear Creek or Ash Grove Spring. 

 Near the entrance of Mule Creek and of several of the tributaries of White 

 River, are some beautiful exhibitions of the architectural features of the Bad 



1857.] 




156 ^ PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Lands. They remind one of some ancient city with its palaces, domes and 

 towers. At the mouth of Mule Creek we have one of the most picturesque views 

 in this region. An area of two miles wide and six miles long has been worn 

 away by the eroding agency of water into myriads of conical and pyramidal 

 peaks, high sharp ridges and deep winding canons two hundred and fifty 

 to three hundred feet in depth. The summits of these ridges are capped with 

 layers of coarse-grained sandstone, containing many whitish particles of clay 

 which have been dissolved out by exposure, and give to the rock the appearance 

 of worm-eaten masses. We then have underneath the sandstone a yellowish 

 calcareous marl passing down into a light gray grit ; then the flesh-colored 

 Turtle bed with its peculiar fossils. Most of the same organic remains are found 

 here as at Bear Creek or Ash Grove Spring, but not near so abundant. A 

 species of land shell, Helix Leidyi, a single specimen of which was discovered 

 at Bear Creek in 1853 by Mr. Meek and the writer, occurs at this locality in 

 great numbers. Continuing our course down the south bank of White River, 

 we see on our left the main range of the Bad Lands rising high above the sur- 

 rounding country, and extending in an easterly direction to the head of Teton 

 River, where it ceases abruptly. On our left as far as the eye can reach we see 

 outliers of the Tertiary exposing their whitened surfaces, and resting upon Cre- 

 taceous bed No. 5. 



Nearly in a direct line south of Grindstone Hills, and near the dividing ridge 

 between White and Running Water Rivers, we meet with a high outlier of 

 Tertiary called Eagle Nest Hill, from the fact that an eagle has built her nest 

 on its summit from time immemorial. This hill is about eighty feet in height 

 above the surrounding prairie, with nearly perpendicular sides, composed 

 mostly of indurated clay with a mixture of calcareous matter. Not far distant 

 is another hill of the same formation, about a mile long, and covered to some 

 extent with pines and capped with a bed of sandstone twenty to thirty feet in 

 thickness. All around the base of these hills the Cretaceous bed No. 5 is 

 seen with a few of its peculiar fossils. 



About ten miles north east of this point, near White River, we meet with a 

 denuded area which presents some peculiarities worthy of note. Here I ob- 

 served a vertical seam of fine-grained sandstone passing through the different 

 strata for several hundred yards, varying in thickness from four to thirty inches. 

 Sometimes this vertical seam is left standing, the more yielding calcareous 

 marl having been washed away from either side, and thus it forms a high 

 jierpendicular wall having much the appearance of mason work. It is com- 

 posed of a fine, light gray grit, and is doubtless due to the infiltration of fine 

 sediment in a fissure in the strata. At this locality we have, in descending 

 order, rather fine grained gray sandstone, then a yellowish or flesh-colored 

 calcareous marl, containing many tough argillo-calcareous concretions. This 

 forms bed E of vertical section, and contains at this locality numerous remains 

 of turtles and mammals. Within the space of a mile I saw of turtles — portions 

 more or less entire — more than thirty individuals. Fragments also of Oreodon, 

 Rhinoceros and several new species of Mammalia, one of which Dr. Leidy has 

 described as Steneofiber Nebrascensis, 



We continue to see quite numerous isolated patches of this deposit until 

 reaching the forks of White River, below which point they almost entirely 

 cease, and the river cuts deeply through Cretaceous bed No. 5 into No. 4. 

 The alluvial bottoms are composed of the light-colored clays and sands 

 of the Bad Lands, but the bluffs are formed of the yellow and dark ash- 

 (•olored clays of the Cretaceous formation, with a few fossils, as BactiUtes, 

 Ammonites, Inoceramus, S^c. Passing down the Slissouri River, the next indica- 

 tion of the Tertiary deposit is at Medicine Hills, about eighty miles below Fort 

 Pierre. These are a lofty group of hills, the upper portions and sides of which 

 are covered with large fragments of rocks, which seem to have been removed 

 from their position by denudation. This rock holds the same geological 

 position and is similar to that on Bijou Hills, but is, in some instances, of a 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 157 



riner and more compact silicious character, and in others a coarser conglonae- 

 rate. These Hills are of considerable interest, as forming an intermediate link 

 uniting Bijou Hills to the main body of the Bad Lands. The two upper beds 

 of the vertical section are represented at this locality. The last outlier of 

 this deposit is seen at Bijou Hills on the opposite side of the Missouri 

 Rivor in lat. 43A°. These are a group of isolated hills towering high above 

 the surrounding country and forming prominent land marks for the voyager. 

 The two highest hills border upon the river and are from four to six hundred 

 feet in height. Farther into the interior are two other hills, the first about two 

 miles long, and the second about eight miles, ranging in a nearly east and west 

 course, sloping gently down toward the Coteau de Prairie. In the summer of 

 1853 I ascended one of the hills nearest the river in company with my friend 

 Mr. Meek, and, from a denuded portion near the summit, we obtained several 

 fragments of jaws and teeth belonging to two new species of mammals, which 

 have been described by Dr. Leidy as Ilipparion spcciosum and Merycadus nccaius. 

 In the autumn of 1856 I discovered on the denuded summits of the same hills 

 Hipparion occidcntalis and two new genera, Leptarctus primus, an animal allied 

 to the raccoon, and MerycMppus insignis, a remarkable new genus of ruminant 

 horse. These remains have all been described by Dr. Leidy in the Proceed- 

 ings of the Philadelphi;. Academy. 



The summits of these hills are capped with a bed of bluish-gray conapact 

 rock, quite variable in its character. Sometimes it is very fine, not unlike a 

 metamorphic rock ; again it is composed of an aggregation of particles of 

 granular quartz, interspersed with a few small water-worn pebbles; then 

 a coarse grained somewhat friable sandstone. Farther into the interior, 

 capping the summit of the long hill, this rock may be seen in places twenty 

 to thirty feet in thickness. The calcareous grits and marls underneath, may 

 be subdivided in descending order thus : — 



1st. — Yellowish-gray grit, with compact, fine calcareous concretions. 



'Ind. — Yellowish-white calcareous marl, containing great quantittes of the 

 comminuted fragments of bones. 



3;-c?. — Compact whitish calcareous clay, with a few vertebrate remains and 

 concreting limestone. The aggregate thickness of these beds I could not 

 determine, as the sides of the hill were, for the most part, covered with a 

 surface deposit of considerable thickness, sustaining a good growth of vege- 

 tation. 



The foregoing notes are designed merely as preliminary to a more thorough 

 description of the geological character of this most interesting deposit. Its 

 Miocene age and the Miocene affinities of most of the genera and species of fossils 

 yet obtained from it have already been discussed in an interesting paper by 

 Prof. Leidy, published in the Proceedings of the Academy for March, also 

 in a paper by F. B. Meek and the writer, published in the Proceedings for 

 April. 



The Zoological arrangement of the Catalogue is copied from Prof. Leidy's 

 paper published in March last. The object of the table is simply to show as 

 far as has been ascertained the stratigraphical position of the different 

 fossils, and the letters are made to correspond with those representing the 

 beds in the vertical section. 



The illustrative section accompanying this paper is intended to show the 

 relations of the Tertiary basin to the Cretaceous beds, and especially to 

 render more clear the connections of the widely separated outliers, Medicine 

 Hills and Bijoux Hills with the main body of the Bad Lands.

CALYPTRAPHORUS. 



Shell subfusiform; spire acutely rostrated; beak straight, very slender; 

 labrum with a sinus at summit and base, elsewhere entire ; a calcareous de- 

 posit covers the entire shell within and without.

 south, where the water is brackish, resembling Cyrena in that respect, and it is 

 found in great abundance attached by its byssus to Ostrea Virginiana. The 

 hinge resembles that of Sepiifer and Breissena, with the addition of a singular 

 cap-shaped, thin, white appendage, which projects obliquely towards the cavity 

 of the valves. Another species inhabiting St. Domingo has been figured and 

 described by Recluz as Dreissena Domingensis. 



Notices of some Bemains of Extinct Fishes. 

 liY JOSEPH LEIDY, M. D. 



1. Hadbodus priscus, Leidy. 



The genus and species are founded upon the fragment of a bone with two 

 teeth, apparently of a Pycnodont fish allied to Placodus, obtained by Dr. William 

 Spillman, from a cretaceous deposit in the neighborhood of Columbus, Mis- 

 sissippi. 



The fragment of bone is about IJ inches in depth and breadth, and about 

 ;( of an inch in thickness; is convex on the outer side ; and presents large re- 

 serve cavities on the inner side at the base of the two teeth which are coossified 

 with one of the borders of the bone. The teeth present a remarkable resem- 

 blance to premolars of a pachydermatous mammal. They are quadrate, and are 

 about as broad as they are high, and about half the thickness. They are bilobed 

 at the triturating surface, which slopes inwardly ; and are invested with smooth 

 enamel, which extends twice the depth externally that it does internally. The 

 two teeth differ a little in form and size. Their height externally is 8 lines ; the 

 breadth of one 8 lines ; of the other 7 lines; and the thickness of both is 4 lines, 

 except the distal lobe of the larger tooth which is 5 lines. 



'I. Phasganodus DIR0S, Lcidy. 



This genus and species are founded upon a much mutilated dental bone with 

 teeth imbedded in a hard mass of sandstone, discovered in Nebraska, by Dr. F. 

 T. Hayden. The specimen I suspect to have been obtained from a cretaceous 

 deposit. 



The dental bone in its perfect condition has been about 6 inches in length, 

 and 2 inches in depth posteriorly. To the dentary border, so far as can be as- 

 certained, there have been six large, coossified, sabre-shaped teeth. The trench- 

 ant border is directed outwardly ; and the obtuse, inner, concave border is- 

 longitudiually ridged. The first tooth visible is about | of an inch from the end 

 of the jaw, and has been about 1] inches long. The second tooth was situated 

 about 1 inch posterior to the first^ and was about f of an inch long. The third 

 tooth, the best preserved in the specimen, about h an inch behind the second, 

 has a strong conical base, and it is 10 lines long". The succeeding teeth de- 

 crease in size, and are at irregular distances apart. The specimen I suspect to 

 belong to a scomberoid fish allied to Enchodus. 



3. TuRSEODUs ACUTus, Leidy. 



This genus and species are founded upon a left dental bone with teeth pro- 



1857.] 




loo PROCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OF 



bably of a ganoid fish, which I obtained from the black shale, of what have been 

 usually considered the triassic rocks, from near Phoenixville, Chester Co., Pa. 



The dental bone is 20 lines long, by 4 lines in depth posteriorly. It is straight, 

 and its outer surface is covered with fine, interrupted ridges, such as are ob- 

 served upon small ganoid scales, found in the same series of rocks at Gwynned, 

 on the North Pennsylvania Railroad. 



Upon the dental border of the specimen there may be counted the remains of 

 20 teeth, situated at irregular distances apart. They have measured from ^ to 1 

 line long. They are columnar in form, slightly curving inward ; have a spread- 

 ing base ; and an abrupt, conical, enamel summit. The fish may be allied to 

 Belonostomus or Eugnathus, but I am unable to ascertain the exact form of the 

 teeth in these genera. 



4. Pycnodus robustus, Leidy. 



The species is founded upon a single large tooth obtained by Prof. G. H. Cook, 

 from the green sand of New Jersey. 



The specimen is 14^ lines long and 3| wide. 



Examination of ENABGITE from New Grenada. 



BY WM. J. TAYLOR. 



I received from Jos. A. Clay, Esq., a fellow member of the Academy, a raice- 

 ral which proves on examination to be Enargite. Mr. Clay received this in a 

 box of minerals from South America; it was labelled " an antimonial silver ore 

 from the mines of Santa Anna, New Grenada ;" there were several other min- 

 erals accompanying it from the same locality. 



Enargite was, I believe, first found in the Cordilleras of Peru, and mineral- 

 ogists were surprised a few weeks since by Dr. Genth's determining a small 

 specimen of a mineral found by the State Geologist of South Carolina, Oscar 

 M. Leiber, Esq., from the " Brewers' Mine," to be of the same species. (" Contri- 

 butions to Mineralogy," by Dr. F. A. Genth, American Journ. Sci. and Arts, 

 May, 1857, p. 420.) The fact of its occurring at another locality will not be 

 without interest. 



The structure of the massive portion of the mineral is columnar, and it is 

 intermixed with a quartose rock and pyrites, in which small cavities occur, 

 filled with the crystalled Enargite, some of which are very distinct. The 

 Enargite is very brittle, its color a greyish black with streaks of the same color ; 

 the powdered mineral is very crystalline with a metallic lustre. Before the 

 blowpipe it decrepitates ; on charcoal, gives the odor of arsenic and a very 

 slight incrustation of antimony ; with carbonate of soda, gives hepar and 

 metallic copper. 



The analysis I made in the laboratory of Dr. F. A. Genth, from a small por- 

 tion of the perfectly pure massive mineral, of which O*7082 grammes wprt- 

 treated with aqua regia and gave the following results ;

Referred to committees, as usual. 



Mr. Lea called attention to the specimen of Chryastolite from the

Mr. Lea also made some observations on the geology of the red sand- 

 stone formation near Gwynned, whence the specimens alluded to by 

 Dr. Leidy, at the meeting of June 16th, were obtained. It is identical 

 with that of Phrenisville, Pa. Mr. Lea alluded to the identity of u 

 large fish scale found by him at Gwynned about two years since, with 

 that figured by Emmons as Radiolepes speciosus, from the Chatham 

 series, N. C, as proving the identity of the formations.

Dr. Corse made some remarks on the development of the spawn of 

 the Frog. He exhibited specimens which he had observed to develope 

 on the fourth day. The Rana pipiens passes a whole year in the tad- 

 pole state, which may account for its occasional comparative scarcity. 



Dr. Uhler alluded to the supposed effect of the late severe winters in 

 diminishing the numbers of the smaller reptiles. 



Dr. Ilallowell remarked that the specimen of Proteus anguinus, 

 which he has had for 13 months, was still alive and healthy, although 

 it had taken no food during that time.

Dr. Uhler, referring to the specimen of crystallized lead presented 

 by him this evening, remarked that he had observed pigs of lead, 

 heated in a reverberatory furnace, when near the point of fusion, become 

 so brittle that they break with a single blow; the fragments are dis- 

 tinctly crystallized. Zinc, by thus heating, becomes so brittle that it 

 may be readily powdered. 



Mr. Lesley remarked, that the specimen of lead presented has the 

 appearance of having been perfectly crystallized, and the edges of the 

 crystals re-fused.

174 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



On three nsw species of VESPERTILIONID^. 

 BY JOHN LECONTE. 



The two first species described below, were handed to me by our associate 

 Dr. Mitchell, as coming from New Granada in Central America. The other I 

 received from JVlr. Cassin, who informed me that it was given to him as a na- 

 tive of Peru. 



I have not been able to discover that they have ever yet been described by 

 any naturalist, at least our very extensive library furnishes no book in which 

 any thing like them is mentioned; therefore I do not hesitate to consider them 

 as new. Should they prove not to be so, they are willingly and freely given 

 up to the naturalist who has been so fortunate as to see them before me ; with 

 a regret, however, that I have been guilty of adding a synonym to that mass of 

 rubbish accumulated by the negligence or design of others. 



Phyllostoma ttnicolor. 



Upper fore teeth 2 — 2 ; the exterior ones very small, scarcely perceptible in 

 the living animal ; the two intermediate ones somewhat serrated at the base, 

 but converging at the point so as to meet; lower four approximate, crowded, 

 emarginate. Head large ; snout elongated ; nose-leaf sessile, but appearing 

 pedicellate from the inflexion of the sides of the base, ovato-lanceolate, entire, 

 with two perpendicular striae, the included portion rather tumid ; horse-shoe 

 (as it is called) or addition to the base of the fore part with five blunt teeth 

 on each side on the outer edge. Upper and under lip with a row of small warts 

 in front. Ears ovate, blunt, with a slight exterior dilatation of the hinder part 

 of the base, orillon triangular, more or less dentate on the outer edge. Tail 

 none. Interferaoral membrane very narrow, very deeply and roundly emargi- 

 nate, being little more than a kind of narrow membranous wing between the 

 legs, with a small interior basal tooth, formed by the protension of the tarsal 

 bone. 



Color uniform both above and beneath, dark brown, almost black ; hair fine 

 and soft ; membrane black, naked, except along the arms, where it is clothed 

 with hair. 



Inhabits New Granada. 



Length 5-3 inches ; head 1-35 ; ears -5 ; orillon -2 ; nose-leaf -4 ; tarsal bone *2 : 

 width of the interfemoral -15 and -2. Extent 11'6 inches. 



Phyllostoma minus. 



Teeth as in the former species. Head large ; snout somewhat elongated. 

 Nose-leaf sessile, triangular, entire, somewhat elongated at the point, horse-shoe^ 

 entire on the edges. Ears ovate, thin, rounded on the front, straight on the 

 hind margin ; orillon oblong, with a few teeth near the base. Tail none. In- 

 terfemoral tolerably wide, deeply emarginate, with a small interior basal tooth 

 formed by the protension of the tarsal bone. 



Color above black, beneath with a slight tendency to mouse color. Mem- 

 brane entirely naked, black. 



Inhabits with the former. 



Length 2-5 inches ; head -9 ; ears -6 ; orillon -2 ; nose-leaf -3 ; tarsal bone -3 ; 

 width of the interfemoral •45. Extent 10-8 inches. 



yeSPERTILIO PERDVIANUS. 



Dentition the same as in V. macrotes. 



Hair brown, above of one color, beneath tipped with greyish white. Face 

 nakedish, black, nose bilobed. Ears ovate, broad, blunt, naked, black, much 

 longer than the head ; orillon long, knife-shaped, the inner edge convex. Mem- 

 brane very thin, naked, brown; interfemoral including the tail, except the two 

 last joints. 



[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 175 



Length 2-G inches; tail 1-8; naked part -1. Extent 11 inches. Head -85 ; 

 cars 1-3 ; orillon -5. 



Inhabits Peru. Resembles very much the North American lon<^-eared bat, 

 is easily distiiiojuished, however, by the absence of the tubercles on the face. 

 It would be called by some Plecotus, but I do not admit of any such genus. 



I have to ask indulgence for introducing into the above descriptions some 

 characters which are not specific, but strictly generic. But the arrangement of 

 the Vespertilionidae is by no means such as can be admitted by any considerate 

 naturalist, it therefore became necessary to include these generic characteris- 

 tics in the two first species, as no deterrainate generic description of the genus 

 Phyllostoma has yet been given.

 of jaws with teeth, obtained by Dr. F. V. Hayden, prove that the large tubercle, 

 which is described as rising out of the base internally of the upper true molars, 

 in a specimen of the skull of the same animal, is an inconstant character, and 

 independent of this, the molar teeth of Leptomeryx and Dorcatherium are identi- 

 cal in form.

Dr. Leidy remarked that there appeared to exist a general misconception in 

 regard to the dentition of the 3Iososaurus. The animal is almost universally 

 called an acrodont reptile, or one in which the teeth are inserted upon, or are 

 co-ossified with, the border of the jaws. A number of specimen^ of teeth and 

 fragments of jaws, in the museum of the Academy, prove this appellation to be 

 incorrect. 



The teeth oi Mososauriis have a recurved pyramidal crown, and a more massive, 

 vertically oblong root, which is often twice the length of the crown. The root 

 is inserted for three-fourths of its extent into a correspondingly deep socket, witli 

 the sides of which it is co-ossified. The centre of the teeth is occupied by a 

 fusiform pulp cavity, communicating with one or more vascular canals passing 

 through the fang. 



In the reproduction of the teeth, it appears the new ones commence to be 

 developed attached to the gum, on the postero-internal side of the alveoli. As 

 they proceed, they penetrate into the latter, by exciting an absorption of the 

 substance of the fang of the old teeth in a direction obliquely outward and for- 

 ward. The cavity for the new tooth increases in size at the expense of the 

 substance of the fang of the old one. The pulp cavity of the old tooth, in con- 

 sequence of the ossification of its pulp, appears to recede before the increasing 

 cavity of the new tooth. The latter cavity finally makes a communication with 

 the former, though this .appears not always to be the case ; and subsequently 

 the fang of the old tooth becomes so completely excavated as to form a mere 

 capsule, from which its crown is brolcen away, or shed, through comparatively 

 little violence. In the further progress of the newly protruding tooth, the 

 osseous capsule formed from the fang of the old tooth is gradually obliterated, 

 except a portion which remains as a partition frona the next alveolus.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPUIA. 1 / / 



Dr. Leidy stated that a few evenings since, in the yard attached to his resi- 

 dence, he for the first time had the opportunity of observing the male Tree- 

 cricket, Oecanthiis, while chirping. The sound, as is well known, is produced 

 by the insect elevating its wings and vibrating them laterally ; by which move- 

 ment the edge of one wing-cover is rubbed upon a rasp or crepitaculum of the 

 other. The sound is like that of the Field-cricket, Ackela, instead of a peculiar 

 one &3 Dr. L. had supposed it to be. The note he had formerly attributed to 

 the Tree-cricket, and with which the woods are vocal during the nights of this 

 season of the year, is one resembling that produced by the quick and repeated 

 snapping of the end of a quill pen or tooth-pick during a second or two of time. 

 Upon examination Dr. L. found this sound to proceed from the male Katy-did. 

 Platj/p/n/llum ; and the mechanism producing it is similar to the stridulating 

 apparatus of the crickets, Acheta, Oecanthus. 



In the male Katy-did, the crepitaculum, situated on the under surface of the 

 dorsal portion of the wing covers, consists of a transverse, fusiform, concave 

 ridge, provided with about fifty serratures ; and is best developed in the left 

 wing cover. The instrument which rubs against this crepitaculum is the sharp, 

 elevated, inner edge of the dorsal portion of the wing covers, at the side of what 

 might be considered a trilateral tambourine, which is best developed in the 

 right wing cover. The song (if the term may be used) of the male Katy-did ordi- 

 narily is produced by the sharp edge on the inner side of the tambourine of the 

 right wing cover, rubbing against the rasp or crepitaculum of the left wing cover. 



Dr. L. continued, he had always supposed the male Katy-did produced the 

 familiar sound after which the insect is named, and that the female was silent. 

 This he believed was the generally received opinion ; and Dr. Thad. Wm. Harris 

 (Insects Injurious to Vegetation, page 138), remarks that at night " the joyous 

 males begin the tell-tale call." Dr. L. added, after further investigation he was 

 happy to be able to clear the male from the libellous imputation, and that, as 

 was usually the case among our own race, the accusation, recrimination, and 

 denial, of katy-did, katy-didn't, came from the female herself. The apparatus 

 by which the female Katy-did tells her tale is totally different from that of the 

 male, though situated as in this, in the dorsal portion of the wing covers. In 

 the dorsal portion of the right wing cover between the marginal vein, and another 

 about half a line from it, there are about five strong transverse veins and some 

 smaller ones, provided upon their upper surface each with a row of strong 

 spines bent back at right angles. All other portions of the right and the whole 

 of the left wing cover are destitute of such spines. In the left wing cover, the 

 corresponding position to that just described is occupied by a fine rete of veins as 

 elsewhere ; and it is the inner edge of this wing cover rubbing against the hooks 

 of the right one. which produces the tell-tale sound of katy-did, katy-didn't.

Dr. J. A. Meigs read part of a letter from Mr. J. Judson Barclay, 

 dated Philadelphia, Aug. 21, 1857, accompanying the flattened skull 

 presented by him this evening. 



" On referring to my journal, (kept during several years residence in 

 Jerusalem,) I find a brief mention of the circumstances attending the 

 discovery of the very singular skull now in your possession, though I 

 fear it will afford but little aid in assigning any other place of habitation 

 to this unfortunate adventurer, than the subterranean locum tenens of his 

 bones. 




178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



The immense quarry-cave, in whicli this skeleton was found, it was 

 our good fortune to discover in 1853, and by the connivance of one of 

 the chief dignitaries of the city, we eluded the vigilance of the Turkish 

 authorities, and succeeded in making a thorough exploration of this 

 hitherto unknown cavern. The skeleton of this adventurous explorer 

 (if such he may be styled) was found in the extreme South end of the 

 cave, 100 feet from the entrance, in a deep pit. The bones (of almost 

 giant proportions) gave evidence of having laid in that position for many 

 years, judging from their decayed state, which, however, is not so appa- 

 rent upon the skull. 



How long since he ended his career, though matter of some uncer- 

 tainty, is obviously no short time, for it is evident that the bats and 

 owls have fluttered over his bones for many long centuries ; for the en- 

 trance to this large quarry-cave is in the wall of the city, which un- 

 doubtedly has been kept carefully closed ever since the subversion of the 

 Frank kingdom of the Holy Land, when the city walls underwent their 

 last reparation. 



The position of this cave, a little elevated above the area of the tem- 

 ple, enabled us to solve an enigma which has heretofore been regarded 

 as an ' opprohimn antiquorum,' — the location of those Cyclopean stones, 

 in their great height in the outer temple wall. 



What may be his history, is a still greater matter of uncertainty. 

 We can only conjecture that he was a pilgrim, who, on exploring the 

 labyrinthine halls of this vast grotto, stumbled down into this deep pit, 

 but whether Jew, Christian or Moslem, is altogether matter of query."

Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



The following extract of a letter from Dr. D. B. McCartee, of Ningpo, 

 China, dated New York, Sept. 3d, 1857, was read : 



" I forward a specimen of the ' insect wax' of China. This was said by the 

 naturalists attached to Sir George Staunton's embassy to be the product of the 

 larva of the Cicada limbata, and that ' the fly' which ' was observed by Staunton 

 on the coast of Cochin China has curious pectinated appendages on the back, 

 and the whole insect is covered with a white powder, which is imparted to the 

 stems of the plants it inhabits.' This is not the case with the wax of which a 

 specimen is sent. It is the product of a very small insect, a species of Coccus. 

 as far as I could make it out. It is deposited near Ningpo on the twigs and 

 smaller branches of a species of ash, in granules, giving the twig the appear- 

 ance of white coral. It is not generally known that it is to be found in the 

 vicinity of Ningpo ; and it was only after a search of two years that I succeeded 

 in finding it. * * * "^ * I think Sir George Staunton was deceived by the fact 

 that the larva of a species of Cicada corresponding to his description is found 

 upon the same tree, as I myself saw." 



Dr. Morris remarked that among the fishes brought from Panama by 

 Dr. Ruschenberger, were found the following Atlantic species which 

 were not previously known to exist in the Pacific : Exocetus acutus, 

 Pristipoma rodo, Epliqjpus faher.

 Abaddie, V. S. N., accompanying ttc donation of skulls presented by 

 him. 



Nos. 1 and 2 are crania talccn from the ruins of Gran Quivira ; they 

 were brought in by an expedition under the command of Major Carleton, 

 who explored the ruins thoroughly, and presented me No. 1 skull. 



No. o. Was disinterred by myself, and found in the centre of the ruins 

 of the church at Guarra, N. M. 



No. 4. Is the skull of Jose Largo, a Mescalero chief, who was killed 

 in a foray near Bosque Kedondo, near the Pecos River, N. Mexico. 



No. 5. Is the head of a Pueblo Indian, taken from the churchyard of 

 their village Laguna. 



No. 6. This skull was found with many other human remains, in a 

 very bad state of preservation, in making excavations in an old field, 

 in Santa F6, N. Mexico. This head, and the remains found, evidently 

 belonged to the same race of Indians which formed the numerous pop- 

 ulation of the large towns long since in ruins, and of which so little is 

 known ; as Gran Quivira, Abo, Guarra Pecos, old Church, kc.

Observations on the Wild Turkey, or GALLOPAVO SYLVESTRIS, of Eay. 

 BY JOHN LECONTE. 



"Whoever has compared the Wild Turkey of the United States with the do- 

 luestic. animal of the s.ame genus, must have observed that there existed very 

 striking differences between them. These differences do not consist of slight 

 and unimportant i)articularities, but in radical disagreements, which ought to 

 remain unchangeable under all circumstances, and which form good specific 

 characteristics. 



In the tame bird, the colors vary infinitelj^, and in the wild one, very con- 

 siderably. The great mark of distinction is in the enormous palear or dew- 

 lap of the former, which extends from the base of the lower mandible to the 

 large caruncles on the lower part of the neck. Whatever alterations may have 

 been produced by long domestication, this palear could not have been formed 

 by an enlargement of the rather loose skin of the neck. It is a specific charac- 

 ter, which as in our own bird is not found in the Meleagris ocellata of Honduras. 

 It has been observed by my son in a former number of our Proceedings, that all 

 derivative variations are monstrosities, and take place chiefly in those parts, 

 which in a normal state of existence, are impossible in the genus, as we observe 

 in hornless beeves and tailless cats, in feather-crested fowls and solid-footed 

 swine. 



The conviction that these two birds were really distinct species has long ex- 

 isted in my mind : more than fifty years ago, when I first saw a Wild Turkev, I 



1857.] 




180 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



was led to conclude that one never could have been produced from the other. 

 I have mentioned this to many ornithologists, but no one would take the trouble 

 to investigate the matter. At length Mr. Gould, one of the best ornithologists 

 of Eurojje, in the 304th number of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of 

 England, has made the discovery, that there have been two species confounded 

 together under the name of Meleagris gallopavo. He calls his species M. mexi- 

 cana having received it from Mexico. I cannot determine from his description, 

 whether it is different from ours, or is the original of the domestic bird. Mr. 

 Gould confines himself entirely to a description of its colors, a very imperfect 

 method of discriminating species. He mentions nothing of the existence or non- 

 existence of the palear, nor of the frontal caruncle so long and extensible in the 

 one, so short in the other. I am however inclined to believe, that his species 

 differs in no manner from our native species. He quotes Brisson as describing 

 his bird, {Brisson, Synopsis Methodica Avium, Vol. 1, p. 158,) and states that 

 Linnaeus's description of M. gallopavo is founded on Brisson's Gallopavo sylvestris 

 and Ray's New England Wild Turkey [Synopsis Aviicm ei Piscium, page 51, No. 3). 

 Brisfon describes and figures the domestic animal : to prove this more fully T 

 quote his words. He says " palea longa sub gutture pendula. Une membrane 

 charnue longitudinale pendante sous la gorge." 



He mentions afterwards among the Varieties, le Dindon sauvage or Gallopavo 

 sylvestris Novae Anglise of Ray. I omit any description of these two birds. 

 Sufficiently detailed accounts of them have already been published, and shall 

 merely observe that the Wild Turkey has been very minutely described by the 

 Prince of Canino in his American Ornithology. 



It may not be amiss to add here some observations on the introduction of the 

 Turkey into Europe. It appears that the earliest visitors to the tropical regions 

 of America observed the Turkey both wild and in a state of domestication. The 

 natives therefore had been able to tame them ; their transportation to foreign 

 countries was thus rendered easy. In about thirty years after the first landing 

 of Columbus in America they are mentioned as birds newly introduced into 

 Europe. The province of Yucatan is particularly mentioned as the place where 

 they were first observed, but I cannot find them mentioned as being cultivated 

 in Spain previous to the year 1520. This may in some measure be owing to the 

 want of Spanish publications of that early date, or at least of translations into 

 the English language of any that may have appeared. We copy the English in 

 thinking that the Spanish have no literature worth noticing : whereas three 

 centuries ago they were far beyond other European nations in literature as well 

 as in all the arts and sciences which adorn or benefit a state of civilization. If 

 we could obtain all that was written and published in those days relative to 

 this portion of the globe, much of the absurd and false relations of modern 

 historians would be treated with the neglect they well deserve. It is a remarka- 

 ble circumstance in the history of Europe, that the rera of the introduction of 

 many important articles of domestic use even in more modern times, is entirely 

 unknown. No one has ever thought it worth while to record the date of the 

 introduction of the Turkey, of Tobacco or of the Potato, into the other continent 

 from the foreign countries where they were first found. In the case of the latter 

 vegetable which has done so much good in the world, and has in fact altered 

 the dietetic habits of whole nations, no one has been able to discover whence it 

 came, or by whom it was first introduced to the notice of civilized men. I 

 scarcely notice the story of its having been brought by Sir Walter Raleigh from 

 North Carolina, as it could not grow naturally in that country, and he never sat 

 foot on the soil of North America. 



The peculiar habits of an animal which strongly resembles another, are fre- 

 quently suflicient when joined to even slight corporeal characters to distinguish 

 it from others. I have before observed that the Turkey was found domesticated 

 among the nations of Central America. Now the bird which we have native 

 among us never has been domesticated. All attempts to conquer its peculiar 



[September, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 181 



habits have failed, notwithstanding what has been said and written to the con- 

 trary. I defy any one to show a Turkey, even of the first generation, produced 

 from a pair hatched from the eggs of a wihl hen. We have every j-ear in our 

 markets offered for sale, birds of a very dark color, and in some «legree resem- 

 bling the wild species : but in every instance by the presence of the palear, the 

 imposition can be detected at first sight and the cheat exposed. 1 have known 

 the eggs found in the woods hatched by a domestic hen, the chickens brought 

 up carefully, and rendered so tame and familiar as to eat out of the hand, and 

 to shew considerable pleasure whenever persons with whom tiicy were ac- 

 quainted approached them. Yet they never would associate witli the domestic 

 turkies, studiously avoiding tlicir company, and in little more than a year run- 

 ning off to the woods, and never again returning to the haunts of their infancy. 

 I know that I shall be contradicted in this statement, and many quotations from 

 authors brought forward against me. I repeat, contrary to the assertions of 

 many others, that no one has ever succeeded in domesticating our Wild Turkey ; 

 I speak not only from my own personal observations, but from the undivided 

 testimony of many southern gentlemen. The Turkey of our own poultry yards, 

 which when young is difficult to bring forward, it was thought might be ob- 

 tained of a hardier race, by a new domestication : but every attempt has failed, 

 nor can I find a single well-aiithenticated case of a mixed breed being obtained.

In the "Fauna Peruana" we find described, a species of worm-snake, Scoleco- 

 phides, which, having teeth upon its lower jaw instead of the upper, belongs to 

 the same group with Catodon and Sienostoma, and since it differs generically 

 from both the genera just mentioned, we propose the new genus

with the following diagnosis : Head depressed, subovoid. Rostral plate extend- 

 ing under the snout. One nasal and one frontonasal : nostril between them. 

 A preocular or postnasal. A frontal. A postoculo-labial. A parietaLand a 

 post-parietal. *

 disposed upon fifteen longitudinal series. Ground color yellowish ; scales mar- 

 gined with brown ; beneath unicolor. Head and neck black with an occipital 

 yellow spot. 



Locality. — New Holland. 



There is likewise a tree-snake, or Dendrophid, which is believed to be 

 undescribed, and which we record under the name of 



Dendrophis prasinus. — Its dorsal scales are very much emarginated pos- 

 teriorly, and disposed upon thirteen longitudinal series. The preanal scutella 

 is divided. Color uniformly green with a whitish line along the abdominal 

 ridge. 



Locality. — New Holland. 



Amongst the true Colubrinae we met with a new generic type somewhat related 

 to Rhinechis and Pituophis, being characterised as follows : '

 and fourth upper labials entering into the orbit. Scales moderate, smooth. 

 Preanal scutella divided. Subcaudal scutellre disposed upon a double series. 



Calliehinus patagoniensis, — is the only species that has, so far, come to our 

 knowledge. The scales are disposed upon nineteen longitudinal series. The 

 ground color is olivaceous, maculated with black. 



Locality. — Coast of Patagonia. 



Another genus of non-venomous serpents, 



CANTORIA, 



is framed upon the following characters : Body subcylindrical, deeper than 

 broad, and very much elongated. Tail moderate, thick upon its base and coni- 

 cal posteriorly. Head depressed, continuous with the body. Mouth moderate. 

 Eye very small. An odd, narrow, prefrontal plate. Nasal plate unique (one 

 right and one left), situated upon the upper surface of the head. One loral. 

 Orbital plates constituting a complete circle around the eye. Scales moderate, 

 smooth, shining, disposed upon nineteen longitudinal series. Preanal scutella 

 divided. Subcaudal scutellae disposed upon a double series. 



The typical species of this genus is Coronella violacea, Cantor, Journ. Asiat.

Locality. — A specimen of the above species was procured at Singapore. 



Next in order is a species closely allied to its congeners, and which we pro- 

 pose thus to characterise : 



Xenodon ancorus. — Two anteorbital and two postorbital plates. Dorsal 

 scales smooth, disposed upon seventeen longitudinal series. Brownish red 

 above, with transverse blotches along the back and an anchor-shaped spot upon 

 the head. Beneath unicolor. 



Finally, we institute amongst venomous serpents, the genus 



DOLIOPHIS, 



which may be recognised by a sub-cylindrical and very much elongated body; 

 the taiUpeing moderate. The head depressed, though continuous with the body. 

 Mouth moderate, provided anteriorly with two fangs on either side. Cephalic 

 plates normal. Two nasals, with nostrils between them. No loral plate. One 

 anteorbital. Third and fourt^ labials entering into the orbit. Two postorbitals. 

 Scales smooth, shining, disposed upon thirteen longitudinal series. Preanal 

 scutella entire. Subcaudal scutellre disposed upon a double series.

This curious Helix differs from any hitherto known. It is readily distin- 

 guished by a white, shining discoidal shell, curious aperture and internal 

 teeth. The upper surface is composed of six whorls, five of which regularly 

 increase from the spire, which is slightly elevated; the last is proportionally very 

 wide, inflated, and elevated above the others, almost to a level with the apex. 

 Below, one full ventricose whorl is visible, and more than half of another, 

 which rapidly decreases until it becomes lost in the small umbilicus. The 

 aperture is oblique, basin-shaped, furnished with four teeth ; of these one on 

 the parietal wall connecting the extremities of the peristome is broad, excavated^ 

 in the middle, angular, resembling that of H. Troostiana, Lea, (plicata, Say) ; 

 on the basal portion of the peristome is another, situated on the edge, perpen- 

 dicular and short; on the right lip, slightly removed within the aperture, are 

 two slight elongated laminai, running horizontally, the lower one raised above 

 the whorl for some distance, thus forming a slender, spear-like point. Behind 

 the teeth on the outer whorl are two pits, between which the shell is pinched 

 into a sharp ridge joining the peristome.

 the two extremities of the sharp and reflected peristome. On the edge of the 

 peristome near the columella are two short, stout, perpendicular teeth, the 

 nearer one the shorter ; within the aperture are two short, slender, tooth-like, 

 horizontal laminee, entering but a short distance ; umbilicus nearly closed ;

 ment of teeth. That H. Loisa is not a less developed specimen of H. Couchiana 

 is shown by the fact of its being twice the size. Mr. Lea's shell has the parie- 

 tal tooth more angular, flexuose, and entering farther into the aperture ; the 

 teeth on the right lip are not horizontal, heavier and longer, and extend to the 

 edge of the peristome, where they are very solid and elevated, while in io/sa 

 they are slender laminee, removed within the aperture.

Hab. Washington Co., Texas. Fr. Moore I 



Shell orbicular, depressed, white, carinated, umbilicated ; spire more or less 

 depressed, obtusely rounded ; whorls 6, distinctly striated, hardly convex ; 

 suture impressed ; below the carina the body whorl is not rounded, but slants 

 down to the base which is parallel with the suture ; below, the stria; are less 

 distinct ; at the umbilical region only 1| whorl is visible, the outer one strongly 

 carinated so as to conceal a portion of the umbilicus and a great part of the 

 remaining whorl ; the umbilicus is very small, but perforates the shell to the 

 apex, showing all the volutions with the aid of a lens ; aperture rounded, con- 

 tracted by three teeth ; lip heavy, broad, white, hardly reflected, near the basal 

 extremity, quite on the edge, armed with two short, incurving teeth, separated 

 by a small rounded sinus ; on the columella there is a tooth-like fold, square, 

 projecting across the aperture, its extremities joining those of the peristome. 



It is difficult to express correctly in words the s{)ecific differences of the vari- 

 ous Polygyra;. This shell combines the characteristics of several American 

 species. It has the spire of H. monodon, Rackett, and the columellar fold of 

 Dorfeuilleana, Lea, as figured Tr. Am. Phil. Soc. vi., pi. xxiv., f. 118. The 

 teeth are placed on the inner edge of the peristome, as in Texasiana, Mor., and 

 the curious carination at the umbilical region resembles that of pustula, Fer.,

Animal iwice the length of the diameter of the shell ; color reddish. 



Mr. J. H. Thompson, of New Bedford, Mass., proposes this name for a shell 

 found by him living in considerable quantities. The circumstances in which 

 it was discovered are very unfavorable to the supposition of its having been 

 brought from abroad. The chances of a Dalmatian shell having been intro- 

 duced into California, and already multiplying there, are very small indeed. At 

 the same time the shell before me bears strong resemblance to the European 

 group of this type. It seems to be between H. albanica, Ziegler, and acies, 

 Partsch ; the carina be.ng less sharp than in the latter. Mr. Thomson suggests 

 that it may have been imported from the Sandwich Islands on vegetables, but 

 there is no species native to that region which bear any resemblance to this.

Shell reddish ashen, orbicularly convex ; spire elevated, conic ; umbilicus 

 open, slightly concealed by the peristome ; whorls six, granulated and sparsely 

 indented ; suture impressed ; below ventricose; aperture transversely rounded; 

 peristome thickened, scarcely reflected, whitish, with a violet tinge, the ex- 

 tremities approaching each other and tbnnected with a callous on the parietal 

 wall ; throat violet. 



" Animal light ashen color, tentacles nearly white ; average length of some 

 thirty specimens 2Mnches (2 diameters of shell); superior tentacles 5-8ths; inferior 

 .T-lGths inch ; foot broad at the posterior extremity; a line of large granules 

 down the jpiddle of the back ; sides of foot margined with a line of light 

 granules (pores) ; genital orifice posterior to and beneath the larger tentacles. 

 In its habits solitary." Thomson. 



It with some hesitation that I propose a name for this shell. I at first con- 

 sidered is as a bandless variety of Californicnsis, Lea. But on expressing this 

 opinion to Mr. Thompson, he gave me the above description of the animal and its 

 habits, which are quite distinct from those of Mr. Lea's shell. Its characteris- 

 tics were found constant at various remote points of the State, and in a con- 

 siderable number of specimens. They seem too great for a simple variety. 

 The animal is also different in its habits from Californiensis, being found only 

 solitary, while the latter is gregarious. 



The shell is one of the very few bandless species of California. 



Helix .eruginosa, Gould. (Proc. Boston Soc. N. H., Feb., 1855, p. 137.) 

 Nomen transmutandum est ob. H. jeruginosam, Pf. (Pro. Zool. Soc, London, 

 1854.) This name being preoccupied for a Philippine Island shell. Dr. Gould 

 proposes to call it H. arkosa. " Inhabits only Redwoods." (Thompson). It 

 seems a very variable shell. The type resembles in shape JI. Toivscndiana, Lea. 

 Among the land shells collected in California by Dr. J. S. Newberry, P. R. R. 

 Survey, was one which I called var. /3 of Dr. Gould's shell. It has a very 

 elevated, conical spire, like elevata, Say, but agrees in other respects with tile

186 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



tjpe. The Californian land shells seem very difficult to understand on account 

 of their variHtion. Although this shell bears little resemblance to Cali/or?nensif, 

 Lea, as fig. in Tr. Am. Ph. Soc, vi., pi. xxiii., f. 19, there is a gradual blending 

 of the two. For some of the links in the connecting chain, see the fig. Terr. 

 Moll, iii, vi. a, Reeve, Con. Icon. 661, and Chemn. Ed. 2, pi. Ivii. fig. 14, 15. The 

 last resembles arrosa, var. /3 very much. This connecting chain of resemblance 

 is also carried by specimens in my cabinet to Di/petilhuarsi, Desh. Future 

 research will alone enable us to draw the correct divisions of the species.

Shell rather solid, white, shining, ribbed above, smoother below; spire obtuse, 

 little elevated, rounded ; whorls seven, convex, the upper ones more flattened, 

 the last bluntly carinated ; carina not reaching the peristome; base parallel to 

 the suture; umbilicus broad, half the larger diameter of the shell, showing 

 two and a half deeply grooved whorls plainly, the others rapidly retreating 

 towards the apex ; aperture very oblique, semicircular, removed from the axis 

 of the shell, bordered with a scarcely reflected, white, heavy rim, grooved 

 behind, and armed with two stout teeth near the basal extremity, broadly 

 reflected at the junction with the body whorl ; on the parietal wall of the aper- 

 ture is a white fold, hardly connecting the extremities of the lip, and projecting 

 across the aperture into an acute point. 



The aperture of this curious shell ^sembles that of Ti. fatigiata, Say. It i? 

 readily distinguished from that and aU other described species by the umbili- 

 cus, broad at the commencement, and rapidly narrowing beyond the second 

 whorl, with the peculiar groove visible in all the whorls of the umbilicus, of the 

 same character as that noticed by Say in auriculaia, though deeper. 



The name is derived from the resemblance of the slightly raised, rounded 

 spire to a low dome. #

Shell very globose, transparent, brittle, thin, shining, reddish ; spire very 

 short, conic ; whorls four, convex, lightly wrinkled, rapidly increasing, the last 

 very large and ventricose; suture moderate; aperture circular, equally high and 

 broad, within bluish anl slightly thickened by a very thin white callus; perist. 

 simple, sharp, thin, at its junction with the body whorl, violet colored and 

 reflected, so as to cover a portion of the small and deep umbilicus; the parietal 

 wall of the aperture is covered with a light violet colored callus. 



Belongs to the same group as H. fuli'/inosa, Binney — but readily distinguished 

 from that and all described species by its transparent, globular shell, ventricose 

 body-whorl, and circular aperture. At the localities where it was found by 

 Mr. Kennicott, H. fuliginosa was not noticed. 



There is a shell received from Texas, by Dr. Newcomb, which may prove to 

 be identical with this.

Habitat in California aut in Oregon? 



Shell globose-conic, imperforate, rather thin, wrinkled, covered with minute 

 and crowded granulations; color reddish brown; apex free from granules, 

 rather blunt; spire elevated; suture impressed; whorls six, convex, tlie last 

 quite large and rounded, falling towards the aperture, and banded with reddish 

 brown above the middle; aperture rather large in proportion to the size of the 

 shell, very oblique, transversely rounded, witliin showing the band; peristome 

 sijnple, reddish ash color, thickened, reflected slightly at the base, end.-s 

 approached; umbilicus entirely covered with a white callus. 



This shell is figured by my father as a var. of H. Nickliniana, Lea. A refer- 

 ence to Mr. Lea's figure and description will at once show it to be distinct, 

 according to the present notions of specific weight. Dr. Gould refers it (Terr. 

 Moll. iii. p. 26) to H. Californiensis ; Reeve, Con. Icon. 661. It appears, how- 

 ever, to be distinct from the shell there figured. 



In general outline it resembles H. Kdle.tlii, Forbes, Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 

 1350, pi. ix, f. 2, as well as Reeve's fig. G65 b, not 665 a. Con. Icon. The resem- 

 blance will be found, however, to cease with the outline, on a comparison of 

 the two shells. H. Kellettii is sometimes perforate, is differently colored, and 

 belongs rather to the group of California Helices represented by II. areolata.

 and the shell before me. 



Helix Dupetithouarsi, Desh. In the collection of the Smithsonian Institute 

 there are specimens of this shell which are furnished with a delicate greenish 

 yellow epidermis. As this has never been noticed in descriptions, I believe it 

 must exist only on very fresh specimens, which are rarely seen. On being 

 immersed some minutes in water, the epidermis becomes of a bright golden 

 color. 



Helix labiosa. Gould, (by many considered identical with Columbiana, Lea.) 

 To Mr. J. H. Thomson I am also indebted for the following interesting notes on 

 this shell. It will be very important to dissect the animal, as it may prove 

 generically distinct from Helix. 



"Animal twice as long as the breadth of the shell, dark slate color, almost 

 black on the head and tentacles; a black line running along each side of the 

 back from the base of the longer tentacles; body covered with compressed 

 granules; tentacles black, acutely pointed : eyes at the base of superior tentacles ; 

 anatomy believed to resemble, somewhat, that of the Lyraniadse. Gregarious; 

 in its habits resembling Lymnaea, being found always near water, and laying 

 its eggs on the water-cresses and other aquatic plants. Arrives at maturity in 

 one year, one half the time required by the other species." 



Helix Californiensis, Lea. " Animal reddish grey, tentacles and base of 

 foot bluish; quite narrow in proportion to the length of the shell; tentacles 

 short. Gregarious, inhabiting dry gullies and hill sides ; many specimens found 

 in a cabbage garden." Thomson. 



Helix sportella, Gould. I am indebted to Mi-. Thomson for a fine specimen 

 of this rare species, the only one I have ever seen. His notes show the animal 

 to be quite distinct from that of H. concava, Say, however similar the shells may 

 be, with the exception of the striae on the Californian species. He writes, " Ani- 

 mal uniformly white or flesh colored, with an orange line on top of back. 

 Solitary — or only found in pairs." 



Helix loricata, Gould. (Lecontii, Lea.) This rare species also was added 

 to my collection through the liberality of Mr. Thomson. One specimen found 

 by him was very much larger than Dr. Gould's shell. He gives the following 

 description of the animal ; " white, linear, rough, posteriorly acute, tentacles 

 very short."

 with a hardly perceptible obtuse carina at the upper extremity of the peristome. 



The only described species with which this shell can be confounded is B. 

 Floridianus, Pf., Proc. Zool. Soc, London, 1855, p. 330.^ Though I have never 

 seen Dr. Peiffer's shell, I should consider it nearly allied, though distinct. It 

 wants the minute revolving lines, the punctured apex, and striate upper whorls, 

 which cliaracterize B. Dormani, is a smaller shell, and has a different marking, 

 being furnished with opaque whitish blotches as well as reddish patches ; the 

 latter also do not extend to tiie body whorl.

The following are notes on the plates contained in Vol. iii. of the Terres- 

 trial Mollusks. 



Helix Rugeli, Shuttleworth, (Diag. neuer Moll. No. 2,) is described as al- 

 ways larger than H. inflecta. Say. I have the latter of the same dimensions as 

 given for Rugeli, 13 mill., and some specimens of Mr. Shuttleworth's shell only 

 8 mill. 



Helix mordax, Shuttleworth, is a variety of H. alternata, Sa3\ I have a 

 large series, showing a gradual change from the typical Northern Shell to the 

 strongly ribbed and more or less carinated Southern form. H. strongolydcs, 

 Pfeiffer, is also a variety of the same shell. Perhaps, also, H. infecta, Parr. 



Helix multiline.ata. Say. I have a variety of this with an open umbilicus. 

 Another, received from Mr. J. A. Lapham, of Wisconsin, is small, of an uniform 

 brownish-red, without a.'iy revolving lines. 



Helix clausa. Say. Terrestrial Mollusks, pi. iv. The outline figures do not 

 represent this species. 



H. viNCTA, Val., Terr. Moll. iii. pi. vi., is certainly distinct from Californien- 

 sis, Lea. (Compare his fig. and descr. T. Am. Ph. Soc. vi. pi. xxiii., f. 79.) 



The centre figure of this plate is H. intercisa, nob. Proc. A. N. S. Phila., 1857. 

 p. 18. Fig. 1. Upper and lower figure cannot be considered a variety of Nickli- 

 niana. I propose for it the name oi redimila. 



PI. vi. a. The European conchologists now consider H. Nickliniana and 

 Oaliforniensis as identical, and figure this shell under the latter name. 



H. DEJJTiFERA is not Confined to Vermont. It is a mountain shell, has been 

 found by Mr. Edwards in Virginia, Dr. S. E. Shurtleff in Western Pennsylvania, 

 Mr. Conrad at Broad Top Mountain, and Mr. Phillips on the Lehigh. 



1857.] 




190 PKOCEEDINGS OP THE ACADEMY OP 



H. NuTTALLiANA, Lea, is universally considered as H. fidelis, Gray. Mr. Gray's 

 descriptioa has the priority of several years. 



H. Vancouverensis, Lea. I see no reason why H. vellicata, Forbes, should 

 not be considered as a variety of this. 



H. EGi5>rA, Gould non Say, pi. xxii. a. This shell, though never seen by Mr. 

 Say, is called by one of his names. It is certainly a disadvantage to increase 

 the already burthensome nomenclature, but is it not worse to make one name 

 serve for two distinct species ? Mr. Say's shell was found by Mr. J. S. Phillips 

 at the 8 mile lane above Philadelphia, and is still preserved in his collection. 

 I think it will prove to be distinct from chersina, Say. The latter has a much 

 moreelevate(i spire, rounded at the top like labyrinthica, Say, and is only obtusely 

 carinated ; while in egena. Say, a very acute carina divides the shell into a short, 

 pyramidal, sharp spire, and a rounded, inflated base, whose outline forms a 

 semicircle. As I consider H. egena a good species, I leave it to Dr. Gould to 

 propose another name for the Florida shell. 



Helix fallax, Say, is certainly more than a variety of tridentata, Say. Not 

 only are the characteristic differences well marked, but the habits of the re- 

 spective animals are different. Mr. J. G. Anthony tells me that tridentata is found 

 on hill sides in the grass, vf\\i\Q fallax inhabits rich soils, in woods, under logs, 

 and is not gregarious like the former. The difficulty is to mark the dividing 

 line between the many varieties of fallax, some of which are quite as distinct as 

 H. Hopetonensis, Shuttl. In one specimen oi fallax in my cabinet there is a 

 well developed "fulcrum" as in monodou, spinosa, and others mentioned by 

 Mr. Lea. 



Helix minutissima, Lea, is certainly distinct from H. minuscula, Binney. Had 

 my father been spared to finish his work, he would have withdrawn the opinion 

 expressed in Vol. ii., p. 221. I have a note of his taken at Mr. Lea's house, in 

 which he says they are distinct. Dr. Leidy tells me that he made a figure of 

 Lea's type for engraving, which was subsequently lost. 



Helix costata, Miill. Dr. F. V. Hayden collected many thousands of this 

 ribbed variety of pulch*ella, Miill. (minuta. Say,) in Nebraska. It had hitherto 

 been noticed only in Philadelphia and Cincinnati. 



Helix glaphtra. Say, pi. xxix., f. 4. That this shell is identical with cellaria, 

 Miill., was the opinion of Dr. Binney. I am able to add to the same effect the 

 testimony of two of our first conchologists, Mr. J. G. Anthony and Dr. Griffith. 

 The former tells me that thirty years ago he found a shell in considerable num- 

 bers in his garden, at Providence, R. I., in all respects agreeing with the Euro- 

 pean cellaria. On carrying it to Philadelphia, the conchologists of that time 

 all called it glaphyra. Say. The testimony of Dr. Grifiith is still more conclusive. 

 I have a letter of his to my father in which he says that he had seen Say's type 

 oi glaphyra in the collection of the Academy, and that it was certainly the 

 cellaria of Europe. He adds, that when arranging the collection, the shell was 

 broken and thrown aside. 



Helix saxicola, Binney non Pf. pi. xxix. a. f. 4, is H. incrustata, Poey. It 

 agrees in all respects with the Cuban specimens in the Academy received from 

 Mr. Poey. 



Helix LncuBRATA, Binney non Say, pi. xxxii. does not represent Say's shell. 

 Though figured by Desbayes in Fer. Hist. pi. Ixxxii. f. 6, it was first described by 

 Pfeiffer, Mong. i, p. 64. The common form is hardly as globose as the sheil 

 figured. 



Helix sulplana, Binney, has been found by Mr. J. S. Phillips on the banks 

 of the Susquehanna, near Wyoming, Pa. 



Helix interte.xta, Binney, pi. xxxvi. The southern form of this shell would 

 by many be hardly considered as the same species. The spire is very much 



[October, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 191 



flattened, color much lighter, body whorl less inflated and very sharply cari- 

 nated. The northern form very rarely reaches the size figured. 



Helix skptkmvolva, Say, pi. xxxviii. Tiie middle figures come nearest to 

 Muhlfeldt's type of cereolun, figured in the Berlin Magazine. The internal lamina 

 mentioned on page 31 is found constantly in II. microdonta, Desh. of Florida. 

 It is not, however, confined to that alone, (Shuttl. Diag. Neucr Moll. No. 2,) as I 

 have detected it in a few instances in the large cereolus and other forms. In 

 Florida there are several varieties of this shell as well worthy of specific distinc- 

 tion as microdonta, Desh., volvoxis, Parr, and delitescens, Shuttl. Miihlfeldt's 

 name cereolus has priority, having been published in ISUi, and not 1818as quoted 

 by Pfeirfer, &c. The European conchologists, Pfeiffer, Reeve, &c., mention as 

 a synonym of this shell H. polygyrata, Binney, a name not even mentioned by 

 him. 



Helix sdppressa, Say, small var. PI. xxxvii. fig. 3. This appears to be 

 hicoslata, Pf. 



Helix plicata, Say, pi. xxxix. f. 2. Mr. Say's type is preserved In the col- 

 lection of the Academy. Having carefully ccmpared it with Mr. Lea's original 

 Troosdann, I am led to believe them identical. In this case Mr. Lea's name alone 

 will stand, as that of Mr Say is preoccupied. In Vol. ii. p. 195, II. plicata is 

 said to be identical with fatigiata. Say, Dorfeuilleana, Lea, and Troostiana, Lea. 

 T cannot agree with this opinion; H. fatigiata is certainly distinct from the 

 others. (PI. xxxix. f. 2.) The characters on which Mr. Lea's two species are 

 founded are certainly not very distinct; at the same time their constancy gives 

 them weight. Of twenty-five specimens found in Tennessee by the Rt. Rev. 

 Bishop Elliott, all were well marked H. Troostiana. 



Helix leporina, Gould, had been found only in Mississippi and Arkansas, 

 until Mr. Postel discovered it at St. Simon's Isle, Georgia, Dr. H. M. Neisler in 

 Butler County, of the same State, and Bishop Elliott at Savannah. Future re- 

 search will probably prove it an inhabitant of the whole South. 



Helix maxillata, Gould, has also been found by Dr. H. M. Neisler in Butler 

 County, Georgia. 



Helix buffoniana, Pf., pi. xliii. This seems rather the variety which Pfeiffer 

 described formerly as distinct under the name of Humboldtiana ; he now unites 

 the two. 



Helix ixflecta, Say, pL xlv. f. 3. It is a typographical error on p. 33 to call 

 this H. triodonta, Jahn. 



Helix polychroa, Binney, pi. xlvi. xlvii. It is hardly necessary to find 

 another name for this shell (ob. H. polychroam, Sowb.) asitseems to bevarians, 

 Mke. 



Helix selenina, Gould, pi. xlviii. This is certainly H. vortex, Pf., of the 

 West Indies. I do not agree with Dr. Gould, (p. 34,) in considering H. tenui- 

 striata, fJinney, as the same shell; a comparison of ihe description of the latter 

 will show them to be distinct. The geographical distribution is also very dif- 

 ferent. Dr. Binney's shell is from Tennessee, while vortex, is a West Indian 

 species, introduced only into the Southern extremity of Florida. The description 

 on the cover, Boston Journal Nat. Hist. iv. part 1, anno 1842, is as follows. 

 '■'■ Ilelijc tenuistriata. Testa depressa, carinata, umbilicata, albido cornea ; anfr. 7 

 oblique striatis ; opertura angusta, depressa, labro subrcflexo, basi convexo. Lat. 

 I poll. Hab. Tennessee." I have a shell in my cabinet to which this descrip- 

 tion applies prutty well ; I am not sure, however, that it is the same. Future 

 research will undoubtedly bring the species to light. • 



Helix auriculata, Say, pi. xl. I do not consider fig. 2, H. avara. Say, as a 

 var. of this, but a distinct species. There are some varieties of auriculata, which 

 may be confounded with it, but it is certainly a good species. Among other

distinctive characteristics it is hirsute, as mentioned by Say. I am indebted to 

 Mr. James Postel, of St. Simon's Isle, Georgia, for some very fine fresli hirsute 

 specimens. From Mr. 0. S. Dorman of St. Augustine, Fa., I have some fine 

 specimens of auriculata, 16 mill, in the greatest diameter. 



Helix elevata. Say. Mr. Robert Kennicott collected in Wisconsin two 

 specimens of a curious variety of this species, furnished with a broad, revolving, 

 brownish band on the body whorl. 



Helix stexotrema, Ter. pi. xlii. f. 4, is a very well marked variety of hirsuta, 

 confined to the region of Tennessee. 



BuLiMUS dealbatus, Say, pi. li. However well defined may be the distinctive 

 characteristics of this species and B. schiedeanus,lactarius, &c., it is extremely 

 difficult to trace the dividing line between them, when seen in large quantities. 

 I have specimens picked from the same bush in Texas, some of which would be 

 referred to each of these species. At the same time it seems hardly possible 

 that the large, heavy shell figured on pi. li. b, should be the same species as the 

 small, fragile shell pi. li., fig. 1. At all events, it is necessary to distinguish 

 them by different names. 



AcHATiNA PELLUCiDA, Pf. pi. Hii. f. 2, is Blauueria (Voluta) heteroclita, Mont. 

 Dr. E. Foreman has specimens found in his garden at Washington, whither 

 they were brought on plants from Charleston, S. C, Mr. T. Bland found it in- 

 habiting brackish water in Jamaica. 



BoLiMus viRGULATUs, Binuey non Fer. pi. Iviii., (see remarks Vol. ii. p. 279.) 

 I'concur entirely with Dr. Gould in considering this shell identical with B. 

 muUilineatus, Say, which name has the priority of many years of Reeve's name 

 venosus. Ferussac's shell is quite distinct.. Mr. Say's description of H. muUili- 

 neatus, (Journ. Acad. N. S., Phila., Vol. 5, p. 120, anno 1825,) is as follows : 

 "Shell conic, not very obviously wrinkled; whorls not very convex, yellowish 

 white, Avith transverse, entire, reddish brown lines ; a blackish subsutural 

 revolving line ; apex blackish ; umbilicus small, surrounded by a broad blackish 

 line; columella whitish, labrum simple, blaciiish. Length less than T-lOth 

 inch, greatest breadth less than 7-20th inch. This species was found by Mr. 

 Titian Peale on the southern part of East Florida." 



Mr. Bartlett found the virgulatus, Binney, in the same locality. 



Glandina truncata, Binney non Gmel., pi. Ixi. f. 1, is G. corneola, nob. vid.

Helicixa ORBIC0LATA, Binucy non Say, PI. Ixxiii. last line, middle figure, is 

 Hel. tropica, Jahn. 



Helicina chrysocheila, Binney, pi. Ixxiv. f. 4. I have specimens of this shell 

 in my cabinet, and consider it distinct from Hel. Jamaicensis, Sowb., and all 

 other described species. I have a note taken by my father at the collection of 

 M. Petit de la Saussaye in Paris, in which he says that a similar shell is labelled 

 from Tampico. Compare Hel. iurbinata, Wiegm., Ch. ed. 2, pi. iv. f. 13, 14, 15. 



Notes on American Land-Shells, deposited by Mr. Say, and still preserved in 

 the collection of the Academy. 



Helix lucdbrata. Say. I have lately found among the shells of the Acade- 

 my three specimens of a shell labelled many years ago, " Jlelix lucubrala, Say — 

 Mexico." I have made a very critical comparison of them with authentic speci- 

 mens of II. caduca, Pf., received through the kindness of Mr. Cuming. I am now 

 confirmed in the opinion I expressed before, that the two shells are undoubt- 

 edly identical. The resemblance of these Mexican shells to II. fuliginosa, Binney, 

 is strong enough to have given Dr. Griffith the impression that they were the 



[Octoberj

same. He expressed himself to that effect in letters to my father. From Dr. 

 Griffith, Prof. Adams may have received the same imj)ression (sec Vt. Moll.) I 

 am inclined to differ from them, believing the sijccies, though nearly allied, to be 

 quite distinct. Until we receive the true II. fuUyinosa from the South-western 

 States, 1 shall doubt its existence there. Our country has been too little 

 searched, however, to allow us to draw very nicely the lines of geographical 

 distribution. If I am correct in my view of this species, Mr. Say's name will, of 

 course, take precedence over that of Dr. Pfeittcr. 



Helix clausa. The specimens are much more globose than that figured in 

 Am. Conch. The aperture is quite orbicular.

Mr. Slack remarked, that the specimens of chalcedony and quartz 

 presented by him this evening, had been obtained from a quarry on the 

 left bank of the Nile, whence was procured the limestone used in the 

 erection of the Pyramids. They appear to have been rejected by the 

 workmen when selectino: the lime. 



November 10<7i, 1857. 



Mr. Cassin in the Chair. 



Dr. Morris called the attention of members to an appearance of the eastern hori- 

 zon just before, at and after sunset. On any clear evening, after a warm day, a per- 

 son looking towards the east a few minutes before sunset, will observe a red band 

 of light extending along the whole horizon; above, it is gradually shaded into 

 yellow light, which passes into greenish, and finally into blue, at various distances 

 from the zenith. As the sun decends in the west, these bands of red and yellow 

 light rise in the east, until the red makes an angle of about 15° with the plane 

 of the horizon, leaving a clear dark blue space beneath. The colors are brightest 

 about ten minutes after apparent sunset : after which they gradually fade away. 

 A cloudy or misty state of the atmosphere near the zenith of the observer ob- 

 scures or prevents the occurrence of the phenomenon : but a fog-bank in the 

 horizon does not interfere. In Kaemtz's Meteorology, translated by Walker, page 

 408, the same phenomenon is partially described, but he places the " white or 

 yellow stripe '' between the red and the blue of the horizon, or below the red. 

 I have never seen it anywhere but as above. Kaemtz thinks that the blue is due 

 to the shadow of the earth projected against the eastern sky, while the red

baad is caused by the absorption of the other constituents of white light in 

 traversing so great an amount of atmosphere. This hypothesis is also main- 

 tained by Mr. Martin in his Notes, F. p. 497 : and he gives a much fuller and 

 better account of the phenomenon as observed in morning twilight by M. 

 Bravais from the summit of the Faulhorn. If it were really due to this cause. 

 no reason could be assigned for the gradual fading and disappearance, first of 

 the yellow and then of the red light, when they have risen about 20° above the 

 horizon ; they ought to follow the sun completely across the sky. I believe 

 the phenomenon to be due to the formation of an iris by the sun's light 

 falling on the vapor of the atmosphere which has become partially con- 

 densed as the sun has receded ; probably this will be found to correspond 

 with the iris given by five internal reflections and two refractions of the 

 sun's rays.

 DuChaillu. 



Fernando Paz River, August 11 Ih, 1857. 



" While hunting after the Gorilla a few days ago, I met with a male surrounded 

 by a few females. The male has a red crest, like a cock. 



"Both the guinea fowl and the black pheasant are birds which are not seen 

 before you reach fifty or sixty nailes in the interior, and are unknown to the 

 natives of the sea shore. The birds of the Fernando I'az country, until you 

 reach the interior, are exactly the same as those of Cape Lopez, the country 

 being similar in appearance. At the Cape properly there is no town : the largest 

 town of the Cape Lopez people is Sangatonga, situated in the bay formed by 

 the Cape. It is the residence of the king, and is situated in a beautiful prairie 

 at the foot of a hill rising about two miles in the interior. The soil of Cape 

 Lopez is generally light and sandy ; the country presents an aspect quite dif- 

 ferent from that between Fernando F6 and the Gaboon, looking a good deal 

 like the countries of Southern Africa toward the Cape of Good Hope — large 

 prairies with groves of trees. In these groves the Cape Lopez people have their 

 plantations, as the soil is good. Sweet potatoes, cassada, plantain, ground nuts 

 and sugar cane are the products. They plant in pretty large quantities, as these 

 form the main staple of their food; sweet potatoes, especially, grow well. Good 

 roads could easily be made, and would be a powerful aid to colonization. The 

 raising of cattle could be made a profitable business, for the prairie land would 

 afford good grazing. A good many wild cattle are seen wandering over the 



[November,

prairies. Water seemed to be rather scarce, haviop met, during a journey of 

 sixty miles into the interior, but four streams : but the natives liave assured mi- 

 that at the bottoms of the hills in the midst of the groves there are a good many 

 brooks. So fur as I have been into the interior I found the country hilly : 1 

 did not meet with marshy ground but at a single place, and that marsh was 

 small. About fifty miles in the interior the prairies become smaller and woods 

 take their place. The country through which I passed was thinly populated: 

 the people have generally to stay on or near the Gaboon or Nazareth rivers or 

 their tributaries. This want of population would be a drawback to colonization, 

 as would also the want of a good harbor. The country near the Nazareth if. 

 better off in this respect."

A number of these birds •were observed for several evenings flying near our 

 camp in company with large numbers of Cypselus Vuuxii. They kept for the 

 greater part near the edge of the forest, and generally flew so high as to be out 

 of the reach of shot of any usual size. One specimen was obtained, which is a 

 male, in apparently adult plumage, and is described above.

Dr. J. A. Meigs announced the death, at Panama, on the 16th inst., 

 of Mr. Geo. R. Gliddon, late a correspondent of the Academy. 



On leave granted, Dr. Leidy offered the following resolutions, which 

 were seconded by Mr. AV. Parker Foulke : 



Resolved, That the members of the Academy have learned with deep regret 

 Ihe death of their late Correspondent, Geo. R. Gliddon, Esq., by whom the sub- 

 ject of Egyptian antiquities was first made familiar to the public mind of the 

 United States ; through whose services mainly, our late President, Dr. Morton, 

 received those indispensable materials for his work on Egyptian Craniology, 

 which now enrich the Museum of the Academy ; and whose indefatigable efforts 

 were constantly given towards promoting a rapid interchange of information 

 l>etween the learned of both hemispheres, upon subjects of leading imj)ortance 

 iu Natural History. 



Resolved, That the members of the Academy desire to bear witness to the 

 extraordinary and disinterested zeal manifested by Jlr. Gliddon, during the 

 period of his personal connection with the labors of this Institution; and to his 

 sincere and ardent pursuit of what appeared to his own judgment as scientific 

 truth ; and they also desire to record their appreciation of the kind and friendly 

 relations which it was his constant and successful endeavor to maintain with 

 them. 



Resolved, That the members of the Academy tender to the beloved wife of 

 Mr. Gliddon, his companion and aid in much of his valuable labor, their most 

 respectful and hearty sympathy. 



Which were unanimously adopted.

Dr. Bridges announced the death of Mr. Chas. McEuen, late a mem- 

 ber of the Academy. 



Dr. Leidj called the attention of the members to a bottle containing numerous 

 specimens of a large species of Gordius discovered by Dr. Wra. A. Hammond, 

 525 miles west of Fort Riley, Kansas Territory. Dr. Hammond states they were 

 found in a pond in great numbers, in company with Siredon. They swam ac- 

 tively forward an inch or two beneath the surface of the water, and occasionally 

 lifted the anterior end even above the latter. 



The collection contains 24 females and the same number of males. The 

 females are cylindrical, light brown of various shades, shining, iridescent ; an- 

 terior extremity narrowed ; head surrounded with a dark brown ring ; tail ob- 

 tuse, slightly compressed, with a terminal genital pore The males are darker 

 colored than the females ; tail extremity more or less spirally enrolled, with the 

 extremity bifurcated ; forks divergent, incurved, smooth, connected at base 

 anteriorly by a crescentic fold, in advance of which is the genital pore ; head 

 as in the female. 



The females measure from 10 inches in length by ^ of a line thick, to 2 feet 

 6 inches in length and 3-5ths of a line thick ; the males 8 inches in length by \ of 

 a line thick, to 2 feet 2 inches in length by 2-5ths of a line thick. 



Dr. Leidy next directed the attention of the members to a bottle containing 

 seven specimens of the larva of a species of Oestrus or bot-fly. They were ob- 

 tained by Dr. Hammond from a pouched rat, Thomomys borealis, at Bridger's 

 Pass, on the summit of the Rocky Mountains, July 1857. Dr. Hammond found 

 the rat panting on the road side, without power of escaping. The bots were 

 found situated beneath the skin of the back, belly, and thigh. 



The body of these larvoB is oblong oval, compressed, incurved ; head minute, 

 composed of a transverse pair of papillary eminences, each supporting two minute 

 ocelli, and having j^rojecting from beneath, forward and downward, a pair of 

 strong black hooks. Spiracular lamina trilobed and marked with vermicular 

 lines. Segments of the body closely covered with discoidal corneous tubercles, 

 of which the anterior ones have their posterior border projecting and dentated. 



The smallest is light yellowish brown ; and as they become larger they assume 

 a darker tint. The largest are black, hard, shining and remarkably shagreened 

 in appearance. 



Length of the smallest larva 5 lines, breadth 3 lines, thickness 2^ lines ; length 

 of largest 9 lines, breadth 5^ lines, thickness 3 lines.

 Vice-President Bridges in the Chair. 



Dr. Leidy called the attention of the members to a drawing of a curious 

 animalcule, found attached to stones and dead stems of plants in the Delaware 

 and Schuylkill rivers. The animal, though closely allied in structure to the 

 Rotatoria or wheel animalcules, yet possesses no rotary or other ciliated apparatus. 

 The body is regularly oval, transparent, colorless, and finely tuberculated. From 

 the anterior truncated extreniitj^ of the body, the animal projects and retracts at 

 will a delicate cup-shaped membrane about half the size of the body. The 

 membrane exhibits delicate and distant longitudinal and circular muscular 

 fibres, which are branching. At the bottom of the cup the mouth communicates 

 with a capacious stomach, and this with a muscular gizzard with lateral jaws, as 

 in most rotifers, and which, as in these, are constantly in motion. From the 

 gizzard opens a second stomach, Avhich communicates with a short intestine 

 terminating in a posterior anal aperture. The digestive apparatus is attached 

 to the outer tunic of the body by diverging muscles. The visceral cavity usuall}- 

 contains numerous eggs in various stages of develoi)ment, from that containing 

 the germinal vesicle to such as contain the fully formed ennbryos. Attached 

 to the inner surface of the body are a number of opaqne, white, irregularly oval 

 bodies. 



[December, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 205 



The size of the animalcule is about tlicl-5th of a line ia diameter. It appears 

 to be permanently lixcJ to the positions in wliicli it is found. When disturbed, 

 it folds up its oral cup like an umbrella and retracts it within tlie body. By 

 means of it, it catches its prey, which consists of smaller animalcules. From 

 the stomach of one individual I squeezed out as many as fifty of the latter. 



For the genus and species the name Dictyophora vorax is proposed.

 sented to the Acadfciuy, on fresh water Naiades collected in Siam, &c., 

 by Dr. House, at the suggestion of Mr. ILiines and others of New York. 

 Seven! of the specimens are very similar to our own species from the 

 valley of the Ohio. A specimen from Australia much resembles the 

 U, Ilopetoneusis, Lea, from Southern Georgia.

 Vice President Bridges in the Chair. 



A paper was presented for publication in the Proceedings, entitled 

 " Observations on a Group of Fossil Shells found in Tippah Co., Miss., 

 with descriptions of fifty-five new species," by T. A. Conrad, which 

 was referred to a Committee. 



Mr. Lea stated, in presenting a specimen to the Academy, that he had visited 

 the locality at Braintree, 10 miles south of Boston, where specimens of large 

 Trilohites have been recently found. The attention of Prof. W. B. Rogers was 

 called, some fifteen months since, to "this unique and most interesting locality,'' 

 by Peter Wainwright, Esq., residing in the neighborhood. Mr. Lea agreed en- 

 tirsly with Prof. Rogers in placing this formation among the more ancient of 

 the Paleozoic jteriods. It lies directly on the granite rocks, or rather it is 

 squeezed in and is embraced by these rocks, (on the east and west sides,) which 

 are disturbed by an upheaval. The formation here is about three hundred 

 yards wide, and lies in a south-east direction. In examination of the quarry, 

 Mr. Lea was kindly assisted by the owner, Mr. E. Hayward, who now carefully 

 preserves the best specimens which are brought to light. He pointed out to 

 Mr. Lea the parts of the quarry where most of the specimens were found, and 

 where some impressions were still remaining in place on the surfaces of the 

 stratification. These surfaces dipped to the south 68°. The rock consists of 

 a very hard, gray, slaty sandstone, frequently breaking into irregular cross 

 fractures. The Trilobitcio\in& here is of great interest. It belongs to the genus 

 Paradozides, and is no doubt the same as described by Prof. Green many years 

 since, under the name of P. IJarlani, of which there is a cast in the collection of 

 the Academy, and which, on comparison with the specimen now presented, 

 proves to be undoubtedly identical. Barande describes and figures several 

 species of the genus Paradoxides from the lower Silurian of Bohemia, which are 

 closely allied to this, and prove conclusively that the strata must be nearly if 

 not precisely on the same horizon.

206 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



Dr. Hammond introduced Major "Wayne, U. S. A., recently engaged 

 in the effort to domesticate the camel in Texas. Major Wayne said : 



It gives me pleasure, Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Academy of Natural 

 Sciences, to comply with the request of my friends, and make a lew remarks 

 before you this evening, upon the experiment of introducing the Camel into 

 America. I esteem the opportunity offered fortunate, as I desire to enlist your 

 interests and sympathies in an undertaking possessing scientific interest, and 

 as I believe great practical benefit, prospectively, for our country. I may not be 

 able to add any thing to your Zoological knowledge, but I may inform you of 

 our purposes, and hope to secure the co-operation of a society so influential 

 and progressive as is yours. 



There have been previous attempts to introduce the Camel into the Western 

 Hemisphere, into South America, Mexico, the island of Jamaica, and according 

 to Mr. D. J. Browne, of the Patent Office, into our own Virginia in the year 

 1701. Of these attempts I have not met with any clear account, either as to 

 their origin, progress or failure. To preserve, to Zoological history, therefore, 

 the present effort, I will premise my remarks by a brief sketch of its rise and 

 progress. 



Shortly after the close of the war with Mexico, when our territory became 

 extended to the Pacific, the advantage of the uses of the Camel in our great 

 interior continent suggested itself to the mind of Col. Geo. H. Crosman, of the 

 Army, who communicated his views to myself and others. Examination of the 

 subject induced the belief that the animal would be of great use, beyond our 

 present means of transportation, (pack mules or wagons,) in carrying on trade 

 and communication through our own deserts ; and that even if, with the pro- 

 gressive spirit of our country, the iron rail and steed should unite the two 

 oceans, that there would be still to the North and to the South large regions to 

 be developed, and that this most profitably and readily could be accomplished by 

 the powers and endurance of the Camel. We saw Congress voting money 

 freely for this or that scheme for personal or local benefit, and we thought it not 

 unjustifiable to ask for $30,000 for an experiment broadly national in its charac- 

 ter, and of which the advantage, if successful, might be said to be incalculable. 

 A bill for the purpose was introduced into Congress by the Hon. Jefferson Davis, 

 cf Mississippi, then Chairman of the Military Committee, who entered waimlj' 

 into the measure, and who subsequently, as Secretary of War, brought it to a 

 successful conclusion. From 1848 to 1855, we struggled with varying fortunes. 

 Our contention was not with men of science. Had it been, no difBculties in the 

 way of an early practical test would have been interposed. But it was with 

 ignorance, prejudice and ridicule. Of the Camel, nothing was known popu- 

 larly. And its only use patent to our people, was to excite wonder and merri- 

 ment in our menageries. It is due, however, to the Military Committees of 

 both the Senate and House to say, that they unwaveringly supported the measure 

 throughout. And here let me add another tribute to that just read by your 

 Secretary, to the memory of one whose name and contributions to science are 

 now historical. I mean the late lamented Geo. R. Gliddon. He aided us 

 much by his knowledge of the East, of the Camel itself, of its uses, with which 

 he had been for many years practically acquainted in Egypt, and enabled us to 

 place the matter in the right point of view before Congress and the Press. The 

 experiment owes to his exertions much of its success. Without wearying you 

 with details, sufBce it to say, through the management of General Shields, of the 

 Senate, a bill was finally passed in favor of the experiment on the 3d of March, 

 1855, and soon after I was sent for by the Secretary of War, and charged by 

 him with the responsibility of conducting it. 



For my first studies, my attention had been given to Africa; but as I pro- 

 gressed, I found myself carried into Asia, and become satisfied that the animal 

 would be drawn from that country with greater chances of success. Taking up 

 Humboldt's Isothermal Lines, and studying the effects of geological structure 

 and topographical formation upon temperature, I carried into America a system 



[Decomberj 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 207 



of Isothermg, corresponding as nearly as I could trace them, with those of Asia, 

 and was led to believe that in Texas, somewhere, I should meet with climates 

 similar to many of those in Asia, in which the Camel lived ; and by the time the 

 bill was passed, and indeed for two years before it, I was prepared with a 

 digested plan, which I am happy to say was carried out without change, and 

 so far fortunately. Nearly two years' experience with the animal on this con- 

 tinent has given satisfactory proof that it will live, propagate and flourish 

 among us. In connection I would here mention, that within a few days I have 

 heard that a fossil camel bone has been discovered in the West, and is so de- 

 clared to be by one of your distinguished members, Dr. Leidy. If this be so, I 

 adopt the fact as evidence, further, that the Camel may be domesticated 

 among us. 



Desirous of informing myself thoroughly of the difficulties in my way, and 

 that I might be certain of having taken them all in, I visited England and France 

 on my route to the East, for the purpose of discussing the matter there with 

 men of science, and of profiting by their suggestions. In England I was cordially 

 received, especially by Professor Owen, and D. W. ilitchell, Esq., Secretary of 

 the Zoological Society, London, and met everywhere with encouragement. Prof. 

 Owen and Mr. Mitchell expressed themselves confidently as to our success. To 

 these two gentlemen mv warmest thanks are due for facilities, encouragement 

 and practical suggestions. In France, I did not mt^et with the same support. In- 

 deed, my visit was at an unfavorable period. The sympathies of this country, 

 with Russia in the struggle then going on, the vile abuse in certain of the papers 

 of the Emperor and Empress, the fillibustering attempts on Cuba, and our own 

 difference in relation to the Consul at San Francisco pending at the time, 

 created in governmental circles impressions not the most favorable to Ameri- 

 cans ; and I found so many delays interposed that the prosecution of my re- 

 searches in that direction (in regard to military experience with the animal in 

 Algeria) were discontinued. The men of science with whom I conversed, spoke 

 doubtingly of the result; indeed, did not think I could transport so many 

 animals, 30 to 40, across the Atlantic, and doubted if those that might be landed 

 would live. With true French idiosyncrasy they examined the question only 

 with regard to Algeria, and did not apparently extend their investigations to 

 the hardier races of Asia. The more I learned, the more convinced was I of 

 the feasibility of the experiment, the only difficulty in the way being the 

 transportation of so many animals across the sea. But on this point I was 

 also sanguine, the Secretary of War having, at my request, committed that 

 portion of the experiment to Lieut. Porter, of the Navy, an officer of ability, 

 ingenuity and experience, and whose complete success fully demonstrated the 

 propriety of the selection. 



If my appreciation of the animal from reading only had been such as to in- 

 duce me to give it so much time, and to risk so much of reputation, you may 

 imagine my estimation of it when landed in the East ; I saw it in use, not only 

 sustaining, but exceeding the limits of utility within which I had restricted 

 my expectations and my declarations. It is really a noble animal, and one of 

 the most wonderful adaptations of the Infinite to the wants of his creatures. 

 Provided with water, as you all know, for several days by the peculiar forma- 

 tion of its stomach, and with sustenance in its ungainly hump, strongly built in 

 front for burdens, and with a protuberant eye that ensures its footing; its fitness 

 tor deserts andfor an irregular, broken country, deficient in water or herbage, are 

 palpably evident. With regard to the particular physical structure which ena- 

 bles it to carry a supply of water for three or four — even, in some cases, seven — 

 days, I have not yet been satisfied. The Camel is a ruminant, and with others 

 of that class has distinctly its four stomachs. The idea of a fifth, as has been 

 adopted by some, I think we must discard. How, then, is the water carried? 

 The best opinion now is, I think, that it is contained in the coatings of the first 

 stomach, in a number of small cells, as water is held in the melon. Such is 

 the view of General Carbreccia, who conducted the experiment with camels in 

 the service of the French army in Algeria. And that the Camel, by muscular

action, squeezes out a sufficient quantity to moisten its food at will. Cuvier 

 goes further, and says the Camel has the power of secreting or creating water. 

 How, he does not say, and we are left by his authority to our own speculations. 

 This is one curious point for our attention, and a satisfactory report upon it 

 would be exceedingly interesting to science. 



The hump is essentially fatty, and by some, has been thought to be intimately 

 connected with the animal's vitality. But I think this opinion erroneous. I have 

 seen nothing myself to sustain it, and Linant de Bellefonds, known in Egypt, as 

 Linant Bey, the Chief Civil Engineer to the Viceroy, who is particularly fond of 

 Dromedaries, told me that he had in two or three instances opened the hump and 

 cut out portions of the fat without apparently much pain to the animal, and cer- 

 tainly with no material injury to it. As I have before said, it is the animal's 

 reservoir of food. When forage is scant, its gradual absorption sustains life and 

 strength, and it is not until that is totally absorbed, that the muscles and stomach, 

 sa with other animals, are attacked. I have seen Camels coming in from long 

 journeys, with their backs almost straight. In the skeleton in your Museum, 

 there is no rise of the dorsal vertebra. In those I have anatomized, I have 

 invariably found a slight convexity of the upper line of the vertebra under the 

 hump, as it were, an arch for its support. 



It was with great difficulty that we could satisfy the public mind as to the 

 hoof of the Camel. That it was not soft and tender, but tough, and capable of 

 travelling safely and comfortably over a fair share of stony soil. On this 

 point. Dr. Atkinson and Mr. Parlane bear ample testimony. The former, the 

 Surgeon General of the Cabul Expedition in 1841, I think, without speaking 

 intentionally of the Camel, introduces him in comparison with their other means 

 of transportation ; and the Doctor speaks of its peculiar surefootedness, and 

 that its broad, tough and yielding hoof trod securely upon the rolling cobble 

 stones of the mountain torrents, while horses and mules slipping on them, were 

 thrown, often to the loss of animal or load, and sometimes of both. The latter 

 speaks particularly to the point, and says, that in his many journeys in Asia 

 Minor, he never saw a rounded hoof. And when we recollect that almost all 

 the trade of Asia, from the confines of Mongolia to the Mediterranean and Black 

 Seas, and from India to Siberia, is carried through Central Asia, over countries 

 mountainous, rugged and desert, through sand and volcanic debris, and that the 

 animal travels in climates so far north as to range several degrees below zero, 

 for instance — the Mountains of Media, at 25° below of centigrade, equal to 13° 

 below of Fahrenheit, we may be satisfied that the Camel's foot is equal to any 

 surface we shall have to expose it to on this continent, and corrects another 

 popular impression, that the Camel is an animal of the Torrid Zone, and cannot 

 stand cold. 



There is one point to which I would especially call the attention of the So- 

 ciety. At my first outset I was confused by the adopted nomenclature of this 

 class of animals established by Buifon. He calls the two-humped animal the 

 "Camel," and the one-humped, the "Dromedary." Now this classification ex- 

 cludes " the Camel" from all the world but a portion of Tartary. Travelling 

 in the East, however, we find the Arabic word " gimel" ^^d/'niel," Hebrew garmal, 

 applied to both species as the generic term, and that the word dromedary is 

 unknown. Examining further, we find the word dromedary to be a derivative 

 from the Greek, (Spofjcw;) runners or racers, ana to have been applied only 

 to the riding or swift species of the one-humped class. For my own satisfac- 

 tion, and to facilitate the cbarness of my researches, 1 adopted the word Camd 

 (Lat. Camelus) as generic, designating the two classes of their nativity. The 

 two-humped I styled the Bactrian Camel, from its ancient home, Bactria, and 

 the single-humped, the Arabian Camel, from the country of its origin in Arabia ; 

 reserving the word dromedary as applicable only to the riding animal of the 

 one-humped species. Subsequently, finding these views to be entertained by 

 Gen. 15. Dumas, of the French Army, Director of, and long connected with, 

 the affairs of Algeria, and by Linant Bey, of Egypt, I have openly adopted this 



[December, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 209 



nomenclature and classification in my official Report, and would respectfully 

 submit it to the consideration of the Academy. The two varieties dill'er as the 

 horse and ass ; the product of the two being a hybrid, deficient in power for 

 the continuance of the race, and if producing at all, giving life to a poor, un- 

 dersized, worthless animal. The cross of the double-humped or Bactrian male 

 upon the single-humped or Arabian female is known as a Tinlu or Booydec, and 

 is the useful animal of the caravan, uniting as it does the strength of its 

 paternity with the quicker movements of its maternal stock. It is classed with 

 the one-humped, though a slight rising in rear of its hump, in many instances 

 hardly discernible, marks its double descent. These animals will lift for short 

 distances from 1,000 to 1,500, even 1,800 pounds, and carry on journeys from 

 700 to 800, making from 18 to 25 miles, according to the character of the 

 country travelled over. For the creation of this useful cross, double-humped 

 males are kept throughout Asia as stallions are with us. I did not see a cross 

 of a single-humped male on the double-humped female, nor did I gather any- 

 thing in relation to it. 



Collecting my animals principally in Asia Minor, including two Bactrians, a 

 Tinlu or hybrid, and Arabian males and females, with a few burthen camels 

 and dromedaries from Egypt, we started for the United States from Smyrna, on 

 the 15th of February, 1856, and landed the Camels on the shores of Texas on 

 the 14th of May, 185G, afier an unusually rough voyage. We sailed from Asia 

 with 33 animals on board, and landed with 34, having lost but one of the original 

 stock embarked, and having had some births on the way. The success of the 

 first importation induced a second; and on the 10th of February, 1857, forty- 

 one more camels out of forty -three embarked were delivered in Texas, making 

 in all 75 safely landed in America. 



So far the results have realized our sanguine expectations. But two of the 

 whole lot, the Bactrians, have fallen victims to acclimatory disease. The others 

 seem to be as much at home as on their native soil, and have been used with 

 convincing proof of their usefulness and advantage. Our ordinary means of 

 transportation in our great inland territory are pack mules and wagons. A 

 pack mule cannot carry on a journey, on an average, more than 150 pounds — I 

 speak from experience with them in Mexico, — and requires a daily allowance of 

 water. The Camel carries from 350 to 800 pounds, according to quality, and 

 is independent of water for three or four days. The mule travels from 15 to 

 20 miles a day ; the Camel from 18 to 25. The mule and the Camel consume 

 about the same amount of food. If anything, the Camel can do with less. 

 Once fed, the Camel is fed for 24 hours. Browsing as well as grazing, it picks 

 up food where other animals would not live, and eats readily spinous plants. 

 In the hyperbolic language of the East, the Camel finds sustenance where the 

 eye of man cannot detect herbage. On one occasion I carried, on six Camels, 

 3,648 pounds, over the same road and distance travelled by wagons, and gained 

 on them 42i hours in time, the wagons carrying on an average only 1,800 

 pounds, and drawn by six mules each. This comparison was altogether acci- 

 dental. Early in this year thirty-five Camels were sent with a party to the 

 Pacific, and I am fortunate in being able to read to the Society the last report 

 from them. Coming, as this testimony does, from a gentleman, Mr. Beale, in 

 no way connected with the experiment of their introduction, I think it may be 

 regarded as impartial. The Camels were attached to Mr. Beale's expedition, 

 under a competent person, Mr. Heap, who had accompanied me on the first expe- 

 dition, and purchased the animals for the second importation. Mr. Beale 

 writes : —

forward confidently to the. day when they will be found in general use in all parts of the 

 country. The idea that their feet would break down in travelling over rocky ground is 

 an exploded absurdity. In all the explorations, over the roughest possible volcanic 

 rock, they have been with us, patiently packing water, of which they never drank a 

 drop, and corn, of which they never tasted a grain. On the expedition, from which I 

 returned yesterday, they were four days without water, and apparently without feeling 

 the want of it. * * * * * * * 



(Signed) E. F. Beale." 



On one occasion, shortly after landing the first importation, and when carry- 

 ing them up from the Coast of San Antonio, the Camels broke suddenly from 

 tlie road and rushed furiously towards one spot a little distance from it. Fear- 

 ful that something had gone amiss, I was hastening towards them with anxiety, 

 when I was met by one of the Turks, holding out to me a plant, and with a face 

 beaming with pleasure. Through the American interpreter, he informed me that 

 it was a plant of which the Camel was particularly fond, and that they had simul- 

 taneously smelt or seen it, and rushed for it. Hence their unusual vehemence. 

 This, as you may suppose, came cheerfully home to me. For if the land bore 

 Camels' food, why not the Camels too? The plant was apparently of the same 

 class as purslane, but though I showed some of it to various persons in Texas, I 

 could hear nothing of its name or quality. 



I have now, gentlemen, endeavored to entertain you so far with these few 

 desultory remarks, and hope I have succeeded in enlisting your interest. I 

 have already occupied too much of your time, and will therefore close by re- 

 ferring to the official Report of the Secretary, published by the Senate, for any 

 further information in detail that you may require. 



Major Wayne further, in reply to a question, stated that the cost of the 

 Camels landed in America, including all expenses, averaged about $105; and 

 that the Camel bore the sea voyage better than any animals he had seen car- 

 ried at sea. That on this point, they were all agreeably relieved. As soon as 

 the vessel became uneasy, the Camels would lie down of their own accord, and 

 so remain until the gale subsided ; and that it was only necessary to secure 

 them from chafing. That from some experience and observation of the 

 transportation of horses and mules during the war with Mexico, be unhesitat- 

 ingly said that he would rather carry 100 Camels at sea, than ten horses or 

 mules. That one of the Camels presented to him by the Bey of Tunis, was on 

 board nine months without leaving the ship, and that he continued in good 

 health, and was now one of the finest of our Camels. 



Dr. Leidy observed, in connection with the interesting remarks of Major 

 Wayne, on the introduction of the Camel into North America, that he had been 

 led by his palaeontological researches to believe the experiment would prove a 

 successful one, and he had so stated his impressions in conversation with mem- 

 bers of the Academy. The grounds of his opinion were founded upon the fol- 

 lowing facts and inferences. The Horse existed during the pliocene period in 

 America, in association with the Elephant, Mastodon, Ox, Deer, Bear, Peccary, 

 Megalonyx, Lion, Capybara, Camel, &c. This fauna most probably indicates 

 the temperature of the American continent, as then formed, to be what it is 

 now, or nearly so. Though most of the genera mentioned became extinct in 

 North America, the others abundantly exist, and the subsequent introduction 

 of the Horse has been exceedingly fruitful in its results. As remains of the 

 Camel (Camdops Kansanus) have been discovered in Kansas Territory, and 

 a congener, the Lama, still exists in South America, the reasons are favorable 

 to the introduction of the recent Camel in this country.

 Genus Archibuteo, Brelim. Tsis, 1828, p. 1269. 



Of this genus there are three North American species, all of which have been 

 misunderstood and confounded with each other in a greater or less degree by 

 authors. Of these, the most common and best linown species, Archibuteo lar/opus, 

 is one of the few birds of this continent which appears to be absolutely identi- 

 cal with the species of Europe long known by this name, the adult of which 

 has been mistaken by American naturalists, while of the European bird the 

 adult has apparently been unknown to British and French ornithologists, though 

 figured and described by the Germans and others of northern Europe.

 others of light cinereous, tip ashy white, cere and toes yellow. 



Young. Upper parts light umber brown, many feathers edged with yellowish 

 white and pale reddish, which colors predominate on the head and neck in some 

 specimens. Under parts yellowish white, with a wide transverse band of 

 brownish black on the abdomen, and a few longitudinal lines and spots of 

 the same color on the breast and neck. Quills ashy brown, with a large basal 

 portion of their inner webs white ; tail at its base white, with a wide subter-

We regard the plumage first described above as undoubtedly that of the 

 adult of this species, though it has never been given as such by any American 

 author. It corresponds precisely with European specimens in the Museum of 

 this Academy, well understood by the German ornithologists to be the adult of 

 A. lagopus, and figured as such in their works, of which some are cited above, 

 lu both adult and young plumage there are no characters whatever, so far as we 

 can see, by which American and European specimens can be distinguished from 

 each other. 



Our attention was first directed to the European species, and to the fact of the 

 adult being known to the German ornithologists, by Mr. Alfred Newton, F. L. S. 

 of Magdalene College, Cambridge, to whom we beg leave to acknowledge our 

 indebtedness for much valuable information derived during his late visit to the 

 United States. 



The other North American species of this genus are :

In young plumage this bird considerably resembles the preceding, but is 

 quite distinct, and generally not difficult to be distinguished. It is larger and 

 has the under parts much more spotted in the young, while of course the 

 clear biack of the adult of the present bird is totally unlike any known plumage 

 of the preceding. In the adult of this species, the tail is of the same black as 

 the general plumage, with one well defined band of white. This species has 

 not yet been observed in Western North America, though rather abundant in 

 the Eastern and North Eastern States.

This bird is larger than either of the preceding and quite different in every 

 known stage of plumage. It is apparently exclusively western, and like the 

 other species of this genus the adult and young are quite unlike each other in 

 colors. Both are described and figured in our work cited above. 



Genus Lanids, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 134, (1766.) 



The species of this genus inhabiting the United States, though not difficult to 

 be distinguished from each other, have been singularly confused by authors. 

 No less than five distinct species have been mistaken for, or rather condensed 

 into two. The North American species are as follows : 



1 Lanius borealis, Vieillot. 



Lanius borealis, Vieill. Ois. d'Am. Sept. 1, p. 80, (1807.) 



Sw. and Rich. Faun. Bor. Am. Birds, pi. 33 ; Vieill. Ois. d'Am. Sept. pi. 50. 



Larger than L. septenlrionalis, and is the largest known species of North 

 America. It is darker colored than that species, and is well described and 

 fio-ured by Swainson, as above cited, who mistakes it, however, for the bird de- 

 scribed aud figured by Wilson under the name La7iius excubilor, which is the 

 species immediately succeeding. 



Specimens of this bird are in the fine collection made in Washington Territory 

 by George Suckley, M. D., a highly talented young naturalist, late of the United 

 States Army. It appears to be a northern and Western species. 



[December, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OP PHILADELPHIA. 213 



Total length (of skin) about 10 inches, (11 inches according to Swainson, as 

 above.) 



2. Lanius septextrionalis, Gmelin.

Wilson's Am. Orn. i. pi. 5, fig. 1 ; Aud. B. of Am. pi. 192, oct. ed. iv. pi. 236. 



Described and figured very accurately by both Wilson and Audubon, and 

 well known as a bird of the Middle and Northern States. Total length (of skin) 

 about 9 inches (10 inches, according to Wilson.) Mistaken by Audubon for 

 the preceding, and this species is meant by that author in 15. of Am. octavo 

 edition, iv. p. 130, and in Synopsis of B. of N. A. p. 157, under the name of 

 Lanius borealis. Wilson, in Am. Orn. i. p. 74, gives this species as "Lanius 

 excubitor ?" doubting its identity with the European species of that name. 

 Audubon, in Orn. Biog. ii. p. 534, does not doubt, but gives it as identical, and 

 says, " On comparing this bird with Lanius exmibitor of Europe, I cannot i»erceive 

 differences that could induce me for a moment to conceive them distinct." This 

 author afterwards did perceive and states very differently in Synopsis, p. 158, 

 where differences between this bird and L. excubitor are pointed out, and also in 

 B. of Am. oct. ed. iv. p. 133. This change in perception is, however, very pro- 

 bably due to Mr. Macgillivray, who claims the authorship of Audubon's Synopsis 

 (in Manual of British Ornithology, i. p. 245, London, 1840.) In allusion to 

 Ilirundo purpztrea, Macgillivray says, " The following characters are those given 

 hj/ me in Mr. Audubon's Synopsis." 



3. Lanius ludoviciancs, Linnaeus. 



Lanius ludovicianus, Linn. Syst. Nat. i. p. 134, (1766.)

Wilson's Am. Orn. iii. pi. 22, fig. 5, Aud. B. of Am. pi. 57, oct. ed. iv. 237. 



In this species the entire upper parts, including rump and upper tail coverts, 

 are uniform in color, which is bluish cinereous, darker on the head and back. 

 It is smaller than either of the preceding, and appears to be essentially a bird 

 of the Southern United States. 



This species is easily determined from the descriptions and figures of either 

 Wilson or Audubon. Total length (of skin) about 8J inches, (9 inches, accord- 

 ing to Wilson.)

About the size of the preceding, but lighter colored, with the rump and upper 

 tail coverts white, and readily distinguished by the latter character. This 

 species inhabits the Western and Northern States ; being brought abundantly 

 from California, and I have seen it also from Wisconsin. It is very handsomely 

 figured by Swainson, as above cited, but I have never seen a specimen with the 

 reddish or pink tinge on the under parts so clear as represented in his plate, 

 though generally perceptible.

Vieill. Ois. d'Am. Sept. 1, pL 51 ? 



Quite as large as L. septentrionalis, and with same strong form of bill, but in 

 colors more resembling L. ludovicianus. The bill is entirely black, upper parts 

 bluish cinereous, rather dark and quite uniform ; wings and tail black ; primaries 

 with their basal half white, forming a very conspicuous spot on the wing ; 

 secondaries with the basal half of their inner webs white. Outer feathers of 

 tail tipped with white, which color increases in extent to the outermost, which 

 are almost entirely white. Under parts white tinged with ashy. Stripe through 

 each eye, united by a narrow line in front, black ; legs and toes strong, black. 



Total length about 9J inches (9^ inches according to Swainson.)

This appears to be exclusively a Western and Northern species, the only speci- 

 mens of which that we have ever seen are in the Museum of the Philadelphia 

 Academy. One specimen was brought from California by Dr. Gambel. 



This bird is perhaps rather larger than L. sejitentrionalis, and resembles it in 

 robustness of organization, but in colors is more like L. ludovicianus. The white 

 spot on the wing is much larger than in any other North American species of 

 this group, and the inner webs of the secondaries are pure white, with more or 

 less black at the ends of the feathers, and as though the white spot of the 

 primaries was continued on the inner webs of the secondaries. All the tail 

 feathers, except the two middle, are largely tipped with white. This bird is ac- 

 curately described by Mr. Swainson as above cited. 



This bird bears a greater resemblance to Vieillot's figure, referred to above, 

 than any other species of North America. 



Selenidera spkctabilis, nobis. 



Belongs to the same group of species as Selenidera piperivora, (Linn.) Gould, 

 Monograph of Rhamphastidae, second edition, pi. 36, and resembling that and 

 other species of this genus in general colors, but with the bill unusually large, 

 and in form and colors somewhat similar to the bill of Rhamphastos ambiguus, 

 Swainson, Gould's Monog. 2d ed., pi. 5, but much smaller and not so dark 

 colored. Rather larger than iS. joepewora or any other known species of this 

 genus. 



Colors of the upper mandible divided obliquely by a line i-unning from below 

 the nostril to the edge of the mandible, within about one third of its length from 

 the tip. Upper portion and tip of upper mandible light greenish yellow, nearly 

 pure yellow at the tip ; lower portion and the entire under mandible dark 

 fuscous green, lighter at the base. Bill at its base with an edging of black as 

 in some species of Rhamphastos. 



Auricular feathers light yellow, tufts on the sides deep orange yellow; tibife 

 dark chestnut ; under tail coverts scarlet. Head, neck, breast and abdomen 

 glossy black. Upper parts of body, wings and tail olive green, darker and 

 tinged with bluish ashy on the tail. Quills with their outer edges tinged with 

 vellow, and their inner edges yellowish white, which is also the color of the 

 under wing coverts. 



No crescent on the back of the neck nor tips of chestnut on the tail in the 

 present specimen. 



Total length about 15 inches, wing 5^, tail 5, bill from the gape 4, from the 

 nostril to tip of upper mandible 3 J inches. 



Hab. — Cocuyos de Veragua, New Grenada. Discovered by Mr. Robert W. 

 Mitchell, of Philadelphia. Spec, in Mus. Acad. Philada. 



This Toucan presents some remarkable and rather anomalous characters. 

 Though having the yellow auriculars and large spots of this color on the sides, 

 and in fact the usual colors of the species of the group designated Selenidera, it 

 has the bill longer and colored in a manner similar to Rhamphastos ambiguus. 

 In form the bill of this species more strongly resembles that of S. piperivora 

 than of any other bird of this group. There is no crescent of yellow on the 

 back of the neck, nor are the feathers of the tail tipped with chestnut, as is usual 

 in this group. All the known species o? Selenidera are in the Museum of this 

 Academy. This species is rather the largest of the genus. 



A single specimen of this curious bird is in a very interesting collection pre- 

 sented to this Academy by Mr. Robert W. Mitchell, son of its distinguished 

 member. Professor John K. Mitchell, M. D., of the Jefferson Medical College. 

 This collection was made in Veragua, the most northern province of New 

 Grenada.

Plestiodon guttclatus, nob. 



Syn. Lam. prosaurus ffullulatus, Ilallowell. Sitgreaves' Report of Exploratior- 

 of the river Zuni. 



We have in the collection of the Academy three specimens of this species, 

 the original one from New Mexico, and two from Kansas, all presented by Dr. 

 AVilliam A. Hammond, U. S. A., to whom the Academy is greatly indebted for 

 several valuable collections, more especially illustrating the Zoology of Kansas 

 and Nebraska, and that of the region of the Rocky Mountains. The original 

 specimen from New Mexico was in such a condition as to render it extremely 

 difficult to determine its true characters ; the two from Kansas, however, are in 

 fine preservation, and '>nables us to present a more accurate notice of it. 



Sp. Char. Color black above, scales shining ; a series of white spots along 

 the upper and lower jaw, also upon the external border of the supraocular plates : 

 32 rows of scales. Total length 3 inches 4^ lines ; length of tail 1 inch d lines. 



For detailed description see Sitgreaves' Report. 



Habitat. Kansas and New Mexico. 



Plestiodon multivirgatum, nob. 



;S^. Char. A small more or less quadrangular plate immediate]}'' above the 

 freno-nasal ; auricular openings circular, with several scales upon the anterior 

 margin ; back with four well-defined blackvittaj, (the two median ones broader,) 

 occupying the half, or nearly so, of the adjacent rows of scales ; besides these, 

 four other narrower black lines, each occupying the angle of a single row ot 

 scales ; the interspaces between the dark colored vittas white, with a bluish 

 tinge ; upper and lower lips white, abdomen bluish, tail white, with a yellow 

 tinge above ; 24 rows of scales. 



Dimensions. Length of head 4 lines ; greatest breadth 3| ; of head and body 

 to vent 2 inch. 3 lines ; of tail 2 inch. 8J lines ; of arm 2 lines ; of forearm 2 : 

 of hand to extremity of longest finger 2\ ; of thigh 2 lines ; of leg 2 lines ; of 

 foot to extremity of longest toe 3 lines. 



Habitat. Posa Creek, 460 miles west of Fort Riley, Kansas. 



One specimen presented by Dr. Hammond, U. S. A. 



Gen. Remarks. In Plestiodon obsoletum there are 28 rows of scales.

 posterior nares of moderate size, teeth arched, in four patches, the two middle 

 convex anteriorly, nearly in contact ; color brownish above ; tail maculated 

 with black ; under parts yellow. Total length Y^ inches ; tail 3.| inches. 



Habitat. New Mexico. One specimen presented by Dr. McClellan. 



Ambystoma bicolor, nob. 



Sp. Char. Head large ; feet very moderately depressed ; tail rather thick at 

 base, rounded above, moderately compressed ; posterior nares small ; teeth in

sa traight transverse row ; color blackish above, sides maculated with yellow 

 tail yellow, beak marked and spotted. Total length 5^ inches ; of tail 2 J. 



Habitat. New Jersey, near Beesley's Point. One specimen presented by Mr. 

 Saml. Ashmead. Perhaps the young of Ambystoma tigrinum. 



Oen. Remarks. A. proserpine of Prof. Baird is clouded with brown, and A. 

 episcopus dark spotted. 



Ambystoma fuscum, nob. 



Sp. Char. Head large, convex, eyes large, prominent, snout rounded, nostrils 

 small, two and a half lines apart ; internal nares rather large, teeth nearly 

 transverse, in four distinct patches, extending across the palate, behind the 

 internal nares ; fingers depressed, the first and fourth of nearly equal length, the 

 4th longer than the 3d ; 4th toe the longest ; toes slightly webbed at base, 

 tail ensiform, of nearly same length as head, neck and body ; color uniform 

 dark brown above, with extremely minute white points scattered over the sides 

 and more sparsely upon the body and upon the sides of the tail ; Indian yellow 

 clouded with brown beneath. 



Total length 5 inch. 2 lines ; tail 2 inch. 7 lines. 



Habitat. Indiana. One specimen presented by Prof. King, of Hanover Col- 

 lege. 



Gen. Remarlts. This animal resembles somewhat the figure of Sal. Jefifersoni- 

 ana, Holb., but in that, beside the transverse row of teeth, there are described 

 two longitudinal series reaching to the posterior extremity of the palate. The 

 toes in Dr. Holbrook's animal are all remarkably long, as they are described to be 

 by Prof. Green in Sal. Jeffersoniana. — Contributions of the Macliirean Lyceum to

LIBRARIAN'S REPORT FOR 1857. 

 During the present year, ending December 31st, 1857, 382 volumes and 1053 

 periodicals and pamphlets have been added to tlie Library of the Academy. 

 The various subjects upon which these treat, and the number belonging to each 

 .-jubject, are shown in the following table :

Of the above works, 73 have been contributed by authors, 71 by editors, 53 

 by members, correspondents and others, 208 by societies and corporations, 45 

 by Mr. Edward Wilson, and 985 by Dr. T. B. Wilson ; making a total of 1435 

 additions to the Library in 1857. 



Among the many valuable additions made during this year, the following 

 may be mentioned : Memoirs and Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences 

 of Berlin, from 1710 to 1850, 85 volumes, from Dr. Wilson; Donovan's Natural 

 History of British Insects, 16 volumes, from Mr. Ord ; sixth volume of the United 

 .States Naval Astronomical Expedition to the Southern Hemisphere, from Lieut. 

 Gilliss ; twelfth volume of the United States Exploring Expedition, from Dr. A. 

 A. Gould ; the terrestrial air-breathing Mollusks of the United States and ad- 

 jacent territories of North America, from the executors of Dr. Binney ; the 

 Zoologist, 50 numbers ; Morris' History of British Birds, 48 numbers ; the Natural- 

 ist, 48 numbers ; Adams' Genera of Recent MoUusca, 26 numbers ; Deshayes' 

 Description des Animaux sans Vertebres decouvertes dans le bassin de Paris ; H. 

 Von Meyer's Fauna der Vorwelt ; Crania Britannica ; Museum Botanicum Lug- 

 duno-Batavum, &c. &c., from Dr. Wilson, and also a number of rare and valuable 

 pamphlets upon Anatomy, Physiology and Zoology from Mr. E. Wilson. 



In 1836 the Library contained about 7000 volumes ; in 1850, it had increased, 

 as was ascertained by actual enumeration, to 12,057. During the fourteen j^ears, 

 from 1836 to 1850, therefore, the annual rate of increase of the Library was 

 about 430 volumes. In 1851, 2,2G2 additions were made to the Library ; in 1852, 

 2,886 ; in 1853, 1,011 ; in 1854, 729 ; in 1855, 857 ; in 1856, 1,449 ; and in 1857, 

 1,435 ; making a total increase during the past seven years of 10,629. From 

 this statement it will be seen that the average annual increase for this period 

 is a little more than 1500 volumes, a rate of increase 3^ times greater than that 

 for the preceding fourteen years. In his report, laid before the Academy in 

 1850, my friend and predecessor, Dr. Wm. S. Zantzinger, presented a classified 

 table of the whole number of volumes in the Library. Taking this estimate as a 

 basis, I have constructed the following table, in which is shown not only the 

 whole number of volumes in the Library, but also the number distributed to each 

 of the leading divisions.

224 PROCEEDINGS OE THE ACADEMY OF 



In the Report above alluded to, Dr. Zantzinger estimated that the works in 

 parts or numbers not yet completed, and pamphlets, when bound, would make 

 about 500 volumes. Since that time the increase in periodicals and pamphlets 

 has been over 6000. If now we regard these, when bound, as equivalent to 500 

 volumes, and accordingly add them to the above sum, we shall obtain for the 

 whole Library a grand total of more than 17,000 volumes. 



During the year more than 400 volumes have been bound in a substantia! 

 manner, and without cost to the Academy, the expenses having been defrayed 

 by Dr. T. B. Wilson. Many other volumes are still in the hands of the binder. 



Owing to the increase in the number of Journals, Transactions, &c., of learned 

 societies received in exchange for the publications of the Academy, Dr. T. B. 

 Wilson, with his accustomed liberality, has caused eight additional cases to be 

 made and placed in the western room of the Library for the better accommoda- 

 tion and arrangement of the books. These cases extend in a row, like a par- 

 tition, nearly across the room from north to south, dividing it into two smaller, 

 oblong apartments, which communicate by a narrow passage, and are lighted by 

 two windows, one at each end. In consequence of these alterations, and the in- 

 creased attendance' at the meetings of the Academy, the latter have, since Novem- 

 ber last, been held in the eastern room, the largest and most coramodioi;s of the 

 three rooms containing the Library. The two northern windows of this apart- 

 ment have been walled up with brick from the floor to the ceiling, so that the 

 dangers from fire in that direction are considerably diminished. Upon the floor, 

 and in the recesses formerly occupied by the windows, two new book-cases have 

 been erected. Gas has also been introduced into this room. The whole cost 

 of these alterations has been borne by Dr. Wilson. 



While congratulating the members of the Academy and the lovers of science 

 in general upon the rapid influx of valuable books and periodicals into the 

 Library, and the increasing facilities thus offered for scientific research, I deem 

 it not inappropriate to take this opportunity of earnestly reminding the mem- 

 bers of the importance of using every eS'ort still further to enlarge the bounds 

 of the Library, protect it from injury, and increase the sphere of its utility. 



J. AiTKEN Meigs, Librarian. 



The Treasurer's Report was read and referred to the Auditors. 

 The Curators reported as follows : 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS FOR 1857. 



The Curators, in presenting their annual report, take pleasure in stating that 

 the Museum of the Academy continues in its usual excellent condition of pre- 

 servation. 



The arrangement of the Museum has made considerable progress during the 

 year now approaching its close, though much remains to be done before it shall 

 be put in complete order. 



The collections, at present nearly or completely arranged and labelled, are 

 those of Mammals, Reptiles, Insects, Crustaceans, of Botany, of Vertebrate 

 Fossils, of Fossil Plants, of Minerals, of Birds' Eggs, and of Human Skulls. 



The collections in course of arrangement, and of which several have made 

 considerable progress, are those of Birds, Fishes, Mollusks, and of Comparative 

 Anatomy. 



The collections of Invertebrate Fossils, Echinoderms, Zoophytes, and Sponges, 

 remain untouched. The first of these collections indicated is a very large and 

 important one, and strongly demands the attention of some of our members to 

 arrange it. 



During the year, Mr. W. J. Binney has nearly completed the arrangement of 

 the Conchological cabinet. Dr. Wilson continues to arrange the collection of 

 Birds, and Drs. Bridges and Morris have made considerable progress in the 



[[December, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 225 



arrangement of the collection of Fishes. The Mammalogical cabinet has been 

 arranged by Col. McCall and Dr. Camac ; and Dr. Wilson and Mr. Schaf hirt, 

 have been engaged in arranging the Insects. 



In relation to the Herbarium, Mr. E. Durand has furnished the following 

 statement : 

 To the Curators, — 



Dear Sirs, — The Herbarium BorealuAmericanum, upon which I have been engaged 

 for these four years, is now nearly completed. As far as it goes, it fills up more than 

 sixty large port-folios. 



In its formation, I have followed the arrangements of DeCandolle, and have just 

 finished the order Gramima: , which is the last of the PhEnogamous jikuits. The number 

 of described species therein contained, amounts to seven thousand two hundred and 

 forty-two, of which 5994 are dicotyledonous, and 1248 monocotyledonous species. It 

 contains, moreover, other plants, either new or as yet unpubUshed, wliich may, in all 

 probability, raise the whole number of plianiogamous species of this particular collection 

 TO eight thousand. When the cryptogams have been added to these, it will form a mass 

 of not less than ten thousand North American plants, constituting one of the most com- 

 plete Herbaria extant. 



This special North American herbarium had become an essential desideratum in an 

 Institution like ours, particularly devoted to the study of the natural wealth of the 

 country. In times past, it was inconvenient and difficult to the student of the botany of 

 North America, to search in the general herbarium, among a mass of forty-six thousand 

 species from all parts of the world, for the particular native plants which he was 

 desirous to examine. Now this work is rendered easy, and he may at once, and without 

 trouble or interruption, examine a whole suit of American species of the same genus or 

 of the same order. 



The Herbarinm Borcali-Americanum, as far as it reaches, has been made up from the nu- 

 merous packages of specimens transmitted to the Academy of Natural Sciences from all 

 jiarts of the country, and piled up, neglected, on the shelves of the Botanical room. It is 

 highly indebted to the valuable private collections of Major LeConte, and of the late Messrs. 

 Conrad and James Reed, and to partial invoices of Drs. Torrey, Gray, Englemann, Short 

 and others. From my own herbarium I have selected for it more than fifteen hundred 

 rare and frequently unique specimens of my collection, all from Texas, New Mexico, 

 the North-VVestern Territories, Oregon and California. The whole number of species 

 contained in this new botanical treasure is at least double that which is to be found 

 scattered in our general herbarium. 



I do not vouch for a complete accuracy of names; but I have performed my task to 

 the best of rny ability. If faulty in some rare instances, it remains open to correction 

 by those who will follow me. Ifit ])osseses other defects, one is that, in many cases, it 

 is overstocked with duplicates; but this I intend to obviate hereafter, by abstracting tht 

 superfluity, with a view to enrich the general herbarium, or to store up duplicates for ex- 

 change. 



The great merit of this valuable collection of North American plants is that it pos- 

 sesses a large number of authentic specimens — almost all the plants of Mr. Nuttali, 

 and many others from Messrs. EJhott, Baldwin, Pursh, Torrey, Asa Gray, Curtis, &c. 



With regard, your most obedient servant, 



Philadelphia, December ilth, 1857. E. Durand.
