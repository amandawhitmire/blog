1870. 



Jan. 4th, 1870. 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair. 

 Thirty merabers present. 



Prof. Leidy called the attentioa of the merabers to a curious fóssil, which 

 had been sent to him for examination last fali by Prof. Hayden. It was found 

 in Colorado, and loaned to the latter by Dr. Gehrung, of Colorado City. 

 Prof. L. remarked that when first received, the specimen strongly recalled to 

 his mind the upper part of the face of the wonderful Sivatherium of the Sivalik 

 Hills of índia. It, however, presents so raany peculiarities, that among other 

 conjectures he thought it might have pertained to the pelvis of a chelonian, 

 but had finally concluded that his first suspicion was the correct one. The 

 specimen corresponds with that portion of the face of Sivatherium comprising 

 the upper part of the nose together with the forehead and anterior horn cores. 

 As is described to be the case in the corresponding portion of the skull of 

 Sivatherium, ali the bonés comprising the fóssil are completely coõssified so as 

 to leave no trace of the original position of the sutures. The nasal and con- 

 tiguous bonés are of great thickness, and as solid as those generally of the 

 Sirenians. The animal to which the fóssil belonged was nearly as large as 

 the Sivatherium. 



The horn cores are nearly like those of the latter in forra, size, and relative 

 position to each other. They are conical knobs, slightly trilateral, and with 

 an obtusely rounded summit, which is more porous than the boné is else- 

 where. They are moderately divergent, and their summits project more over 

 their base externally than in Sivatherium. The space between the cores ex~ 

 tending across the forehead forms a continuous concavity ; and the surface 

 from the end of the nose to the broken border of the fóssil posterior to the 

 cores forms a moderate convexity. In Sivatherium the corresponding surface 

 from the slope of the forehead to the convex rise of the nasais forms a deep 

 concavity. 



The face, as formed by the nasais and their apparent conjunction with the 

 maxillae in advance of the horn cores, is very short in comparison with that- 

 of Sivatherium. The coõssified nasais are proportionately shorter, broader, 



1870.]

and stouter than in the latter animal. Their lateral borders are much more 

 obtuse, and they terminate in a broad, thick, notched point. The ends bor- 

 dering the notch are most thickened and porous, apparently indicatiDg the 

 attachment of a long moveable snout. The nasais do not rise from tbe fore- 

 head in the vaulted manner so conspicuous in Sivatherium and Ekinoceros, but, 

 as previously indicated, simply continue the curvature of the forehead. 



One of the most remarkable characters of the fóssil is the greater extent 

 backward of the lateral nasal notch than in Sivatherium. In this it ceases far 

 forward of the position of the horn cores, situated above the orbits. In the 

 Colorado fóssil the notch continues back and beneath the position of the horn 

 cores, where the nasais apparently become continuous with the maxillaries. 

 The relative position of the orbits cannot be ascertained, as ali the contiguous 

 parts are broken away. They appear to have been situated behind the posi- 

 tion of the horn cores. 



Several measurements of the fóssil are as follows : 

 Distance from the centre of the summit of one horn core to the other.. .10£ in, 



Length of horn cores above levei of the intervening space 5 " 



Length of lateral nasal notch 4j « 



Distance from end of nose to centre of space between the horn cores.... 6 M 



Breadth of nose midway between end and position of horn cores. 4 a 



Breadth of face, where narrowed, below horn cores » 7J " 



It is probable that the fóssil may pertain to the same animal as the remains 

 from the Manvaises Terres of Nebraska, described under the name of Titano~ 

 íherium, but in the state of extreme uncertainty as to its collocation, it may 

 with equal probability be referred to other genera, perhaps to Megalomeryx, 

 or it may have been an American species of the Sivatherium. Under the cir- 

 cumstances it may be referred to a new genus, with the name of Megacerops 



COLOBADENSIS. 



Prof. 0. C. Marsh, of Yale College, exhibited a number of vertebrae of a 

 new Dinosaurian from the cretaceous green sand near Barnsboro', N. J. He 

 observed that they indicated a reptile allied to Hadrosaurus Foulkii Leidy, 

 but only about one half the size of that species. The specimens, although 

 ali found in the same iramediate neighborhood, were apparently portions of 

 three different individuais, only one of which was fully adult. They con- 

 sisted of several dorsal and lumbar vertebrae belonging to the Museum of Yale 

 College, aad an anterior caudal vértebra recently presented to the collection 

 of the Academy by Dr. Leidy. These remains appear to be quite distinct from 

 those already described, and apparently belong to the same species, for which 

 Prof. Marsh proposed the name Hadrosaurus minor. Prof. Marsh also showed 

 the tooth of a new and very large Mosasaurus from the cretaceous of North 

 Carolina. It belonged to a very perfect right upper jaw, formerly in the col- 

 lection of the late Dr. Emmons, and now in the cabinet of Williams College. 

 The teeth of the specimen are remarkably* short and thick, nearly round at 

 the base and their surface entirely without facets. The remains preserved 

 indicate a species of great size, probably sixty feet in length, but with a head 

 and muzzle comparatively short. It was named Mosasaurus crassidens. 



A peculiar caudal vértebra of a somewhat similar reptile from the lower 

 cretaceous marl bed, near Hornerstown, N. J., was likewise exhibited. It is 

 one of a series in the museum of Yale College, and indicated a new Mosasaurus 

 of médium size, apparently belonging to the genus Leiodon. The articular 

 surfaces for the attachment of the chevron bonés were in nearly the same 

 plane as the lower surface of the vértebra;, and not impressed as in Macrosaurus 

 proriger and other allied species. The presence of well developed diapophyses 

 in this part of the caudal series was another peculiarity of these vertebrse, 

 and indicated that the animal had a broad, muscular tail. The species was 

 therefore named Leiodon laticaudus. 



Prof. Marsh stated in this connection that in the November number of Silli- 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPIHA. 3 



man's Journal he had proposed the name Halisaurus for a new genus of Mo- 

 sasauroid Reptiles, but as Halosaurus, essentially the same word, had pre- 

 viously been given to a genus of fishes, he wished to substitute for the former 

 the name of Baptosaurus. 



Prof. Marsh also showed a tooth of a rhinoceros from the miocene of Squan- 

 kum, N. J., which was the first authentic evidence of this animal east of the 

 Mississippi River. It was found in the pits of the Squankum Marl Company, 

 in the same layer with the remains of the Elotherium Leidyanum Marsh, and 

 was presented to the Yale Museum by Mr. O. B. Kinne. The tooth was the 

 last molar of the left under jaw, and indicated an animal about two-thirds 

 the size of the living Indian species. He proposed for it the name Rhinoceros 

 maíutinus. 



Jaru lltlu 

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair. 

 Twenty-five members present. 



Prof. Leidt directed attention to some fossils, on which he made the fol- 

 lowing remarks : 



1. A specimen consisting of less than the half of a vertebral body, was sub- 

 mitted to my examination by Prof. Hayden, who obtained it last summer 

 during his geological survey. It is from Middle Park, Colorado, and Prof. 

 Hayden thinks was derived from a cretaceous formation. Similar specimens 

 were reported to be not unfrequent, and were known under the appellative of 

 M petrified horse hoofs." The fóssil indicates an elongated form of caudal 

 vértebra of some large saurian. Much eonstricted towards the middle, such 

 specimens would be most liable to break in this position, and the halves from 

 their form might readiiy be taken, by the inexperienced in such matters, for 

 what they are called. 



The vertebral body in its entire condition would resemble in form those of 

 Megalosaurus, but in form and other characters bears a near resemblance to 

 those of Poicilopleuron Bucklandi. This is an extinct reptile from the oolitic 

 formation of Caen, in Normandy, described by Deslonchamps ; and remains 

 apparently of the same animal from the Wealden of Tilgate, England, have 

 also been described by Prof. Owen. 



Poicilopleuron has generally been viewed as a crocodilian reptile with bi- 

 concave vertebrae, but probably pertains to the dinosaurs. The P. Bucklandi 

 is estimated by Deslonchamps to have been about 25 feet long. The Colorado 

 fóssil indicates a much larger animal, having been more thaa one-third 

 greater. 



One of the most remarkable characters of the Poicilopleuron is the presence 

 of a large medullary cavity within the bodies of the vertebrae, paralleled 

 among living animais, so far as I know, only in the caudal vertebrae of the ox. 

 The same character is presented by the Colorado fóssil. In the former animal 

 the cavity appears simpie or unobstructed by osseous trabeculae. In the 

 Colorado fóssil, as seen in the broken surface of the specimen, the medullary 

 cavity occupies the lower two thirds of the interior of the body and is crossed 

 by a few trabeculae. The sides of the cavity, converging below, are consti- 

 tuted by a layer two lines thick and as compact as the walls of the medullary 

 cavity in the limb bonés of most ordinary mamm&ls. The upper third of the 

 interior of the body is occupied by the ordinary spongy substance which be- 

 comes more compacted ascending into the interior of the neural arch. The 

 cavernous structure of the Colorado fóssil is occupied with crystalline calcite. 



The estimated length of the vertebral body is six inches or more. The sides 

 are much narrowed towards the middle, and they are concavely depressed just 

 below the suturai conjunction of the neural arch. A narrowgroove occupies 



1870.]

tiie lower border of the body, as is indicated to be the case in the Tilgate 

 specimens. The posterior articular surface of the body is moderately de- 

 pressed, but its lower fourth curves forward, producing a thick, convex ledge 

 for the accommodation of a chevron. The breadth of the articular surface is 

 scarcely four inches, and its depth is about the same measurement. 



The species represented bythe fóssil may be named Poicilopledron valkns. 

 Should the division of the medullary cavity of the vertebral body into smaller 

 recesses by trabeculae be significant of other characters indicating the Colo- 

 rado saurian to be distinct from Poicilopleuron, it might be named Antro- 

 dkmus. 



2. A collection of fossils from the cretaceous formation of Pickens Co., 

 Alabama, received from Dr. J. C. Nott, formerly of Mobile, indicates a mosa- 

 sauroid reptile apparently of the genus Clidastes, of Prof. Cope. The speci- 

 mens consist of an anterior portion of one ramus of the lower jaw, a portion 

 of the upper jaw, an axis and several dorsal vertebrae. The species was of 

 intermediate size to G. iguanavus of tbe cretaceous of New Jersey and C. 

 propython of Uniontown, Alabama. It may be named Clidastes intermedius. 

 The jaw fragments indicate more robust proportions than in C. propython.^ 

 The fragment of the lower jaw is 5£ inches long and contains a series of 

 nine teeth ; the depth of the symphysis is one inch ; the depth below the 

 seventh tooth almost an inch and a quarter. 



The body of a dorsal vertebrae is almost an inch and a half long ; its ar- 

 ticular cup is a little over an inch wide and about three-fourths of an inch 

 vertically. The neural arch retains the zygosphene and zygantrum, indicat- 

 ing the iguanian character of the extinct reptile. 



Since communicating the above I have received for examination some 

 remains apparently of the same species, from the cretaceous formation of 

 Kansas. Among them are two nearly entire dentary bonés, the length of 

 which is about eleven inches. They contain the bases of the teeth, indicating 

 the full series to be twelve. The more slender jaws of C. propython, with 

 the dentary bonés about the same length, contain a series of about eighteen 

 teeth. 



3. The caudal vértebra represented in figures 15, 16, plate II, of the " Cre- 

 taceous Reptiles of the United States," indicates a reptile apparently of the 

 genus Leiodon or Macrosaurus. The constitution of the vértebra is the same 

 as in the caudais of the known species of this genus. It probably belongs to 

 the species desi-ribed by Prof. Cope under the name of Al. proriyer. 



4. The fine specimen of a fóssil turtle exhibited to the Academy was loaned 

 by Mr. O. C. Smith, of Amherst, Mass., through Prof. Hayden, for my exami- 

 nation. It was obtained, hS the latter informs us, from the Bridger Group of 

 tertiary rocks, probably of miocene age, in the vicinity of Fort Bridger, 

 Wyoming. It appears to represent an extinct genus, approaching in char- 

 acter the existing Dermatemys of Central America, and was nearly of the size 

 and shape of Dermatemys Mawii, Gray, of Vera Cruz and Tabasco, C. A. 



The carapacein its general form and construction especially resembles that 

 of the latter. It has the same elongated vertebral plates and scutes. The 

 sternum is intermediate in its proportions and shape with those of Dermatemys 

 and Staurotypus. The interspaces of lhe carapace and sternum are very much 

 larger than in the former, but proportionately less than in the latter. The 

 pedicles of the sternum are not so deep as in Dermatemys, but are much wider. 

 The back part of the sternum, intermediate in its proportions with what it is 

 in Dermatemys and Staurotypus, ends in a posterior narrowly rounded ex- 

 tremity, not acute as in the latter, nor emarginate as in the former. Derma- 

 temys has two large scutes intervening between the unusually large inguinal 

 and axillary scutes. In Staurotypus the axillary and inguinal scutes meet 

 across the sternal pedicles. In our fóssil a single large hexagonal scute in- 

 tervenes to the axillary and inguinal scutes. The latter are much larger 



[Jan. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. Ò 



than in Dermatemys, and extend ia advance of the suture between the hyo- 

 and hypo-sternal plates. 



The name of Baptemys Wyomingensis is proposed for the turtle. When 

 complete the carapace has measured about one foot and a half in length by 

 one foot in breadth. The sternum has measured about one foot in length ; 

 the depth of its pedicles 4 inches, their breadth 3 inches ; the length of the 

 posterior extremity 4 inches, its breadth at base 4} inches. 



It is probable that the specimen, from the same locality. upon which was 

 characterized the Emys Wyomingensis (Pr. A. N. S., 1869, 66,) belongs to the 

 same animal. 



5. Among a multitude of fragments of turtle shells obtained by Mr. J. Van 

 A. Cárter from the same formation and locality in which the preceding speci- 

 men was found, there are many apparently of the Trionyx gul tatus (Pr. A. N. 

 S., 1869, 66.) Some of the fragments pertain to an emydoid diífering from 

 the preceding, but they are too imperfect to ascertain the exact generic char- 

 acters. In this species both the vertebral plates and scutes are proportion- 

 ately much wider in relation with their breadth than in Baptemys. The 

 scutes mentioned are deeply impressed, whereas in the latter their boundaries 

 are scarcely traceable. The series of vertebral plates from the first to the 

 eighth, inclusive, measure eight and a half inches. The fore part of the 

 sternum is truncate as in Dermatemys, but not so much produced. For the 

 species the name of Emys Stevensonianus is proposed, in honor of James 

 Stevenson, the companion and able assistant of Prof. Hayden in his geological 

 explorations of the west. 



Prof. 0. C. Marsh, of Yale Oollege, exhibited a series of specimens of the 

 remains of birds from the cretaceous and tertiary of the United States, which 

 showed that this class was well represented during these periods, although 

 no species have yet heen described from these formations in this country, and 

 none indeed from older rocks, since it now appears to be well established 

 that the bird-like foot-prints in the ConnecticUt Valley were made by Dinosau- 

 rian reptiles. Among the species shown were the remains of at least five species 

 of cretaceous birds, although but one, or possibly two, species have hitherto 

 been described from strata of this age in Europe. The present cretaceous 

 specimens were ali found in the green sand of New Jersey, and with one ex- 

 ception in the middle marl bed. They are ali mineralized, and in the same 

 state of preservation as the bonés of extinct reptiles found with them in these 

 deposits, and hence are readily distinguished from the remains of recent birds 

 which have occasionally been found near the surface in the marl excavations 

 of New Jersey. 



The most interesting of the specimens exhibited was the distai portion of 

 a large and robust tibia, apparently of a swimming bird, about the size of a 

 goose ; it was found in the green sand at Birmingham, New Jersey, in the pits 

 of the Pemberton Marl Company. For this new genus and species Prof. 

 Marsh proposed the name Laornis Edvardsianus. Two species of small wad- 

 ing birds, which appear to have been allied to the Curlews, were also repre- 

 sented, each by the distai end of a tibia, and probabty by some other less 

 characteristic portions. The larger of these species, which was found in the 

 green sand of the middle marl bed at Hornerstown, New Jersey, was named 

 Palseolringa liltoralis, the smaller species, which was called Palceotringa vetus, was 

 founded on the specimen mentioned byDr. Morton in bis Synopsis of cretaceous 

 fossils (p. 32), which has since, however, been generally regarded as a recent 

 species. The specimen was found in the lowest marl bed at Arneytown, N. 

 J., and is now in the collection of the Acaderay. Portions of the humeri of 

 two small and closely allied species, apparently related to the Rail family, 

 were part of the series shown. They were found deep in the green sand of 

 the middle marl bed, near Hornerstown, N. J., in the pits of the Cream Ridge 

 Marl Company. For the species thus represented the names Telmatornis priscus 

 and Telmatornis affinis were proposed.

The remains of several species of tertiary birds were also exhibited by Prof. 

 Marsh. Among these was the lower extremity of a tibia, closely resembling 

 that of some of the cranes. It was found in the miocene of the Niobrara 

 River, by Dr. F. V. Hayden, and is interesting as the only representative of a 

 fóssil bird yet detected in the tertiary deposits west of the Mississippi. This 

 specimen, which belongs to the Academy, indicated a new species, which was 

 named Grus Haydeni. Another species of extinct birds was represented by 

 portions of a humerus and ulna, also in the collection of the Academy. They 

 were found many years since in the miocene of Maryland by Mr. T. A. Con- 

 rad. This species, which appears to be closely related to the Petrels, was 

 named Puffinus Conradii. Several other interesting specimens of bird remains 

 were shown, but most of them were not sufficiently characteristic to admit of 

 determination. With the exceptions already mentioned, the fossils exhibited 

 belonged to the museum of Yale College.

Mr. Wharton said that the ore of the nickel mine at Gap, Lancaster Co., 

 Pa.,consists substantially of a sulphide of iron, in which a small part of the 

 iron is replaced by nickel, copper and cobalt. This ore after washing is 

 smelted in a high furnace, and yields a matter about seven times as rich as the 

 ore in the valuable metais, that is, containing 10 to 15 per cent. of nickel and 

 cobalt and about one-third that quantity of copper. In this matter there are 

 found at rare intervals small lamellar crystalline bodies, having high metallic 

 lustre and pliability. In order to give a clearer idea of the nature of this 

 substance, or to discover perhaps something still more interesting, search 

 was made during several years of the mass remainiug in each furnace bottom 

 after its extinguishment, in those instances where the matter had shown the 

 plates above named. Finally in such a bottom, definite crystals were found 

 in the cavities of the matter, which crystals, being subjected to analysis, 

 showed, Copper, 1-85 per cent. 



Nickel and Cobalt, 25-22 " 

 Iron, 6410 " 



Sulphur, 8-90 " 



100-07. 



Supposing the copper to exist as CU2S there would remain of nickel, cobalt 

 and iron (whose atomic weight are nearly similar) 89-32, and of sulphur 8-43, 

 thus indicating the formula RqS. As a crystallized compound of this com- 

 position has perhaps not yet been described there is a certain scientific in- 

 terest in the observation made. 



The crystals are very highly magnetic, very readily taking and holding 

 polarity enough to cause a spicula to place itself in the line of the magnetic 

 meridian when floated upon a surface of water. Their color is about that of 

 zinc.

" Descriptions of new species and genera of Fossils from the Palseo- 



zoic Rocks of the Western States." By F. B. Meek and A. H. 



Worthen. 



Prof. Leidy directed attention to a specimen received from the Smithsonian 

 Institution for examination, which he said was the upper two-thirds of the 

 right humerus of one of the extinct giant sloths, and was obtained in Central 

 America by Capt. J. M. Dow. It agrees so nearly in form, proportions and 

 size with the corresponding portion of the arm-bone of the Mylodon robustus of 

 Buenos Ayres, as described and figured by Prof. Owen, as to render it probable 

 it may belong to the sarae species. 



The specimen is unworn, black, not petrified, has no adherent rock ma- 

 trix, and looks as if it had been obtained from alluvial mud. The interior of 

 the shaft presents a long wide cavity, which might be viewed as the medullary 

 cavity were it not that ali the known extinct giant sloths have the limb bonés 

 solid. There would perhaps have been less hesitation in deciding as to the 

 character of the cavity, were it not that comparatively recently a reverse con- 

 dition was observed in a boné where it would not have been anticipated. A 

 short time ago Mr. James Orton, of Rochester, N. Y., submitted for examination 

 a collection of bonés from the valley of Quito, Ecuador, S. A. The specimens 

 were obtained at an altitude of 10,000 feet, and from Mr. Orton's account, were 

 imbedded in a cliff of unstratified silt 400 feet in height. Among the bonés, 

 besides those of Horses, Lamas, etc, there was the fémur apparently of a 

 Mastodon, but solid or devoid of a medullary cavity. 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 9 



If the hollow interior be the natural condition of the Mylodon-Yike humerus 

 under inspection, it would not belong to Mylodon robustus. Independently of 

 the cavity indicated, the boné is sufficiently different in size and form to indi- 

 cate a different species frora the Mylodon Ilarlani of North America. The hu- 

 merus from Oregon, described by Perkins (Am. Jour. Sei. 1841, xlii, 136), and 

 referred to the latter by Prof. Owen, is not only much larger, but it is of 

 greater breadth in relation with its antero-posterior diameter. The fragment 

 of a humerus from Big-Bone-Lick, Ky., represented in fig. 3, plate xiv of my 

 " Memoir on the Extinct Sloth Tribe," is somewhat smaller than the corres- 

 ponding part of the Oregon specimen, and is more compressed or wider in 

 comparison with the antero-posterior diameter. 



Prof. Leidy further observed that there appeared to be a point of some sig- 

 nificance in the anatomy of the mandible of Dromatherium silvestre worthy of 

 attention, though the appearance- may turn out to be a deceptive one. Prof. 

 Emmons had discovered three isolated rami of mandibles of this most ancient 

 of American mammals in the triassic coal of North Carolina. Of the speci- 

 mens, one is represented in fig. 66 of Emmons' American Geology, repeated in 

 outline in fig. 650 of Dana's Geology. Another specimen Prof. Emmons pre- 

 sented to the Academy, and is contained in our museum. The point of inter- 

 est to which reference is made is the apparent absence of a condyle. This 

 process may have been lost, but in the two specimens seen by Prof. L. — that 

 figured by Prof. Emmons, and that preserved in our museum — a.separation of 

 the process is not obvious.

Prof. Leidy made the following remarks : — The reptilian remains from the 

 cretaceous formation near Fort Wallace, Kansas, presented to the Academy by 

 Dr. T. H. Turner, and described by Prof. Cope under the name of Elasmosaurus 

 platyurus, belong to an Enaliosaurian, as originally suggested by Prof. Cope. 

 The anatomical characters of the different regions of the vertebral column, 

 those of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and of the preserved portions of the 

 skull and teeth, are decidedly Plesiosaurian. 



Prof. Cope has described the skeleton in a reversed position to the true one, 

 and in that view has represented it in a restored condition in fig. 1, pi. ii. of 

 his " Synopsis of the Extinct Batrachia and Reptilia," Pt. I, August, 1869, 

 published in advance for the fourteenth volume of the Transactions of the 

 American Philosophical Society. To explain the apparently anomalous and 

 reversed arrangement of the articular processes (zygapophyses) of the vérte- 

 bra?, he has supposed that those as ordinarily existing are substituted by the 

 second set of articular processes (zygophene and zyg3ntrum), as found in 

 serpents and iguanians (Proc. Bost Nat. Hist. Soe. xii, 265 ; Syn. Ext. Bat. 

 and Rept. 42). 



The finding of a portion of the jaws, as reported by Dr. Turner, in the vi- 

 cinity of what Prof.Cope has supposed to be the cervical portion of the 

 skeleton, and which he considers as confirmatory of the view he has taken 

 of its position, without further consideration, is more than compensated in the 

 opposite end of the column terminating in a coõssified axis and atlas, as is the 

 case also in the mature Plesiosaurus. The cup of the atlas still retains the 

 hemispherical occipital condyle. 



The Kansas saurian was wonderful for the length of its neck, far exceeding 

 in this respect the Plesiosaurus. The vértebra? in the specimen form a nearly 

 unbroken series to the seventy sixth inclusive. If we regard ali as cervical 

 until the transverse processes begin to spring in part from the spinal arch, it

will comprise the extraordinary number of seventy-two. In the different spe- 

 cies of Plesiosaurus, so far as known, the number ranges from twenty-four to 

 forty-one. The length of the neck, independent of the head, was about twenty- 

 two feet. 



The cervical vertebrae successively increase in length to about the forty- 

 fourth, then remain nearly the same to the sixtieth, and afterwards gradually 

 decrease. The atlo-axis is about 2\ inches long; the third cervical is l£ 

 inches ; the tenth nearly 2 inches ; the twentieth 2| inches ; the thirtieth 3| 

 inches : the fortieth 4 inches ; the forty-fourth 4£ inches, and so to the six- 

 tieth ; and the sixty-eighth to the last one about 3f inches, which is also about 

 the length of the succeeding four dorsais. 



The imperfections in the remainder of the vertebral column of the Kansas 

 saurian do not permit a positive estimate to be made of the comparative ex- 

 tent of the trunk and tail. 



A comparison cf the caudal vértebra? with isolated specimens from the cre- 

 taceous formations of Alabama, Mississippi and New Jersey, leaves but little 

 doubt that Elasmosaurus is identical with Discosaurus. Such also appears 

 originally to have been the opinion held by Prof. Cope in regard to a portion 

 of the same skeleton, which he referred to a species with the name of Disco- 

 saurus carinatus (LeConte's Notes on the Geology of the Survey of the Union 

 Pacific Railroad, 1868, p. 68). 



Specimens of vertebral bodies from the New Jersey green sand, referred to 

 Cimoliasaurus (Cret. Rept. of the United States, pis. v, vi), and supposed by 

 me to belong to the posterior part of the column, are seen by comparison with 

 the Kansas skeleton to be cervical and perhaps anterior dorsais. The differ- 

 ence in the proportions of the corresponding vértebras appear to indicate the 

 genus to be distinct from Discosaurus. 



The imperfect vertebral specimens from Arkansas, originally referred to 

 Brimosaurus (Pr. Acad. Nat. Sei. 1854, 72, pi. ii, figs. 1 — 3), are probably pos- 

 terior cervicais of Discosaurus. 



In the true view of Discosaurus and its allies, the so-called order of Slrepto- 

 sauria (Proc. Bost. Nat. Hist. Soe. 1869, 265 ; Synopsis Ext. Batr. and Rept., 

 40) fails to maintain its positioa. 



The extensive shoulder and pelvic girdles of the Kansas saurian, so much 

 like those of Plesiosaurus, were most probably provided with limbs construeted 

 like those of the latter animal. 



In its restored condition Discosaurus would appear to have resembled Plesio- 

 saurus in its form as ordinarily represented, excepting that it possessed a much 

 longer neck, — one indeed that exceeded that of ali known animais. We may 

 imagine this extraordinary creature, with its turtle-like body, paddling about, 

 at one moment darting its head a distanee of upwards of twenty feet into the 

 depths of the sea after its fish piey, at another into the air after some feathered 

 or other winged reptile, or perhaps, when near shore, even reaching so far as 

 to seize by the throat some biped dinosaur. 



Prof. Leidy subsequently exhibited fragments of a fóssil mandible, upon 

 which he made the following remarks : The specimens were obtained by Prof. 

 F. V. Hayden from the tertiary rocks of the Bridger Group, near Fort Bridger, 

 Wyoming. They indicate a carnivorous animal, apparently of an extinct and 

 heretofore unknown genus. Unfortunately the teeth are lost, except portions 

 of some of the molars. The animal was larger than our Panther, and proba- 

 bly was a member of the same family, but with a relationship to the Hyaenas. 

 The portion of the jaw preserved nearly agrees in form with the corresponding 

 portion in the Cats, but its depth beloAV the position of the teeth is propor- 

 tionately greater, resembling in this respect more the condition in the Striped 

 Hyaena. 



Remains of the canine alveolus indicate a tooth of more robust proportions 

 than in the latter animal. The symphysis pursues the course of the alveolus. 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELJPHIA. 11 



Of several mental foramina, the largest one is situated below the position of 

 the first premolar. 



The condyle holds the same relative height as in Cats. The back portion 

 of the jaw, including the coronoid process, is proportionately not so broad as 

 in the latter. The masseteric fossa is shaílower at its lower part, and is not 

 bounded by the everted base. but is defined a little above the latter in a curva- 

 ture sweeping from the condyle downward and forward to an angle about half- 

 way below the position of the last molar tooth. 



The molar teeth, of which there were five, completely occupied the space 

 back of the canine, as in some of the viverrine and musteline animais, there 

 being no hiatus in the series. Ali the molars were double-fanged, and none 

 appear to have been of the tubercular kind. 



The first premolar was the smallest, and the third premolar appears to have 

 been the largest tooth of the molar series. The fourth premolar was interme- 

 diate in size to the third and the last molar, which appears to have but little 

 exceeded this and the second premolar. 



The remains of the crown of the last molar indicate a bilobed tooth, appa- 

 rently like the sectorial molar of Felis, and wiíhout aheel. The crown of the 

 tooth in advance was provided with a well-developed heel, but the fore part 

 is too much broken to ascertain its form. The larger tooth in advance, the 

 third premolar, retains its heel, which has a subtrenchant fore and aft border, 

 and is bounded internally and externally by an oblique basal ridge. 



For the animal indicated by the fóssil jaw, the n am e of Patriojelis ulía is 

 proposed. The measurements òf the specimen are as follow :

Prop. Marsh exhibited specimens of the remains of abird allied to the Tur- 

 key, which he considered as belonging to an extinct species. These remains 

 were said to have been found in the green sand of Monmouth Co., N. J., but 

 doubtless were from the post-tertiary above it. He proposed to name the 

 species Meleagrit altus. 



Prof. Marsh also called attention to the tooth of a Peccaryfrom the miocene 

 of Shark River, New Jersey. It is a second molar from the left side of the 

 lower jaw. He proposes to call the species to which it belonged Dicotyhs 

 antiquus.

" Descriptions of Fossils collected during the U. S. Geol. Survey 

 under the charge of Clarence King." By F. B. Meek. 



Prof. Leidy exhibited specimens of iehthyodorulites, upon which he made 

 the following remarks : 



Xiphactinus audax. The genus and species are founded on an interesting 

 specimen belonging to the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, and ob- 

 tained from the cretaceous formation of Kansas by Dr. Sternberg. From the 

 want of symmetry in the base of the specimen, I suppose it to have been the 

 pectoral spine of some huge siluroid fish. 



It is a broad sabre-shaped weapon, in its present condition sixteen inches 

 long, which is near its original length, if one may judge from the thinnessand 

 rounding ofthe border at the broken end. At its middle it is nearlytwo inches 

 broad and almost seven and a half lines thick. It slightly narrows and be- 

 comes thinner towards the outer end, and becomes thicker and more narrow 

 approaching the base. An inch and a half from the latter it is thirteen and a 

 half lines thick and seventeen lines wide; and the same distance from the 

 outer end it is the fourth of an inch thick and twenty lines wide. The anterior 

 convex border is rounded at first, but becomes subacute at its outer part. The 

 posterior concave border is rather more obtuse. 



A large groove commences back oí the root, extending outwardly, becoming 

 contracted and deeper, and opening to its bottom along the under part of the 

 spine to its outer extremity. The bottom of the groove is irregularly pitted, and 

 its upper surface formed by the overhanging posterior portion ofthe spine is 

 transversely corrugated or striated. A similar but shallower groove com- 

 mences in front of the root, and extending outwardly opens beneath the spine 

 at the anterior half of its surface. 



The upper surface of the spine is nearly flat and longitudinally striated, ex- 

 cept at the outer part of the anterior border, where the striation is finer and 

 curves forward. 



The root of the spine turns up into a sort of hook-like process, broken at 

 the end. It has been about two and a half inches in height from a levei with 

 the inferior surface of the spine. The inner part of the root forms a vertical 

 oblong convexity, the lower half of which is occupied by a raised facet, appa- 

 rently an articular surface, upon which the spine moved. 



Prof. Agassiz, in his Poissons Fossiles, has described specimens of ichthyo- 

 dorulites from the chalkof Lewes, England, which he referred to placoid fishes 

 of the genus Ptyckodus, '« from the circumstance of their constant occurrence 

 in the same localities " as teeth upon which the genus was first established. 

 These rays are especially remarkable for their segmented character. " Instead 

 of being composed of a single piece, as in other genera, they consist of flat 

 rods, or rather broad, thick plates intimately united, but rendered distinct on 

 the surface of the ray by longitudinal grooves." Without question as to the 

 reference of these rays, I exhibit several similar specimens from the cretaceous 

 formation of Kansas, submitted to my examination by the Smithsonian Insti- 

 tution. The same collection of fossils, of which the rays were part, also con- 

 tained many teeth of Ptychodus Morloni, but I am uninformed whether they 

 were found in association. 



The specimens are probably two fragments ofthe same ray, but an interme- 

 diate piece is wanting, and they are imperfect at the opposite ends. They also 

 appear to be somewhat compressed from pressure. As a whole the ray is flat 

 at the sides, with a thickened, convex, posterior border, and an acute dentated 

 or festooned anterior border. The dentate processes are composed of a denser 

 tissue than the rest of the ray, and are thickened in a line from the point to 

 the base. The body ofthe ray is composed of longitudinally oblique bars as- 

 cending from the posterior border to the bases of the dentate processes in 

 which they are merged. The longer and broader fragment is four and three- 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. » 13 



quarter inches long and three-quarters of an inch wide, gradually tapering to 

 seven lines, and is provided with about seven and a half dentate processes. 

 The other fragment is three and three-quarter inches long, seven lines wide 

 below, and four lines at the broken apex, and is provided with nine dentate 

 processes. 



The segmented condition of the ray recalls to mind a singular fóssil speci- 

 men formerly described by me as the portion of a jaw of a fish to which the 

 name of Edestus vorax (Jour. Acad. Nat. Sei. iii, 159, pi. 15) was given, and 

 which also exhibits a segmented condition. This fóssil, notwithstanding its 

 jaw-like appearance furnished with shark-like teeth, I have always suspected 

 was an ichthyodorulite (Proc. 1856, 301), and this suspicion is increased by 

 an examination of the rays supposed to pertain to Plychodus. 



Astbracanthus siderius. The species is founded on a fragment of an 

 ichthyodorulite, found on a stream near Glasgow, Tennessee. The specimen 

 was submitted to my examination by Prof. J. M. Saíford,through Prof. Hayden. 

 It purports to be of subcarboniferous age. but perhaps this is an error, for ali 

 the previous known fossils attributed to the genus are of much later age. ít 

 looks as if in its complete condition it had approximated in size the dorsal 

 spine of Asteracanthus ornatissimus, which is a foot and a half long. The frag- 

 ment is from an intermediate position at the junction of the root and shaft, and 

 is a little over three inches in length. Broken at the extremities, and posteri- 

 orly, so as to leave no remains of a groove, it is composed of solid porous boné, 

 and is triangular in transverse section. The triangle of the shaft has a base 

 seven lines thick ; the sides are about three-fourths of an inch wide, and the 

 apex is rounded. The root is compressed laterally to a greater degree than 

 the bottom of the shaft, and in the fragment is an inch and a half wide. 



The lateral surfaces of the shaft are closely covered with large mammillary 

 tubercles, which have been worn off at the summits. These tubercles are of 

 enamel-like hardness, brown and lustrous. Their sides are closely and longi- 

 tudinally wrinkled; the fewer wrinkles near the apex becoming branched and 

 more numerous approaching the base. The tubercles are situated in parallel 

 longitudinal rows, having a slight obliquity. The intervals formed by the 

 divergence of the longer rows near the root are oceupied by shorter rows. 

 About thirteen rows, including the short ones, may be counted on one side of 

 the specimen at the verge of the root. 



Prof. Leidy further observed that the two fossils presented this evening by 

 Henry Green, of Eliznbeth, Jo Daviess Co., Illinois, through Dr. Edward D. 

 Kittoe, of Galena, were of considerable interest. They consist of a metacarpal 

 boné of the Giant Sloth of Jefferson [Megnlonyz Jeffersoni), and a last lower 

 grinder of the extinct Ox, Bison antiquus. They were discovered, in the search 

 for lead, in a narrow crevice of the lead-bearing rocks, at the depth of 130 

 feet, in the vicinity of Galena. A number of other bonés were found at the 

 same time, but, unfortunately for the interests of science, these are scattered 

 or lost. 



The museum of the Academy contains fossils which were found in a similar 

 position in the same locality some years back. Of these, some were presented 

 by Dr. LeConte, who obtained them from Mr. Snyder of Galena; others were 

 presented by my friend Dr. Kittoe. They consist of remains of an extinct 

 Peccary, Platygonus compressus, larger than the existing species ; an extinct 

 Raccoon, Procyon priscus, and a large iasectivore, named in honor of Mr. Sny- 

 der, Anomodon Snyderi. These animais were probably cotemporaries of the 

 former. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan said that no one who examined the prevailing theories 

 concerning the formation of bark and wood with numerous living specimens 

 before him, could be satisfied that these theories were in ali respects correct. 

 He had made numerous observations during the past year, which satisfied him 

 that at any rate we had much to learn. He hoped to present these observa-

tions to the members at some future time, but at present wished only to direct 

 their attention to a portiou of a trunk of Yucca alcefolia, which he exhibited, 

 the structure of which he suggested could not be accounted for ou any theory 

 generally known. The general idea was that the sap of plants ascended through 

 the system, and was elaborated in the leaves, where the woody matter was 

 formed, and afterwards dacended, — in exogenous plants forming a regular con- 

 centric layer over the last year's wood, and in eudogenous structures returning 

 by the interior, pushing these descending columns of wood through the mass 

 of cellular matter without order or system. 



It would be seen that in this endogenous Yucca the woody matter, if it ever 

 descended at ali, as our present belief demanded it should do, had descended in 

 a very regular and beautiful manner, quite as systematic, in fact, as most exo- 

 gens would do. The wood was arranged in annual rings, not entirely con- 

 cêntrica but some tropical exogens did not have the woody annual layers al- 

 ways forming an entire circle any more than in this. In this case the annual 

 layers of wood extended about two-thirds of the distance round the axis, and 

 such layer was about the eighth of an inch thick. These annual layers were 

 made visible by the bundles of fibres being packed more closely together to- 

 wards the end of the season's growth, just as they are in exogens, from which, 

 indeed, there was very little to distinguish this structure on a cursory exami- 

 nation but the absence of the so-called medullary rays.

Cross fertilization and the law of sex in EUPHORBIA 



BY THOMÁS MEEHAN. 



Mr. Charles Darwin's interesting observations on cross fertilization have 

 opened a new world for original discovery. The list of plants which seem to 

 avoid self fertilization is already very large. I think Euphorbia may be added 

 to the number. Certainly this is the case with Euphorbia fulgens, Karw. (E. 

 jacquinaflora, Hook.) which I have watched very closely in my greenhouse 

 this winter. Several days before the stamens burst through the involucre, 

 which closely invests them, the pistil with its ovarium on the long pedicel 

 has protruded itself beyond, exposed its stigmatic surfaces, and received the 

 pollen from the neighboring flowers. The way in which the pollen scatters 

 itself is curious. In most flowers a slight jar or a breath of wind will waft 

 the pollen to the stigmas, but I have not been able to notice any to leave the 

 flowers in this way^ for as soou as the anther cells burst the whole stamen 

 falis from its filament like pedicel and either drops at once on the pistils of 

 other flowers cr scatters its pollen grains by the force of the fali. 



This Euphorbia also furnishes another contribution to the theory of sex 

 which I have advanced. The plan on which the male and female organs are 

 formed is evidently a common one; and the only reason why some flower 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 15 



heads have a pistil in the center, and others are wholly staminate, is, that 

 there is greater axial vigor when the female flower is formed. Whenever the com- 

 moa peduncle (below the scarlet involucre) is weak, a pistil never appears 

 in that head of flowers. A few which seem strong neither have them, but 

 the great majority of the strong peduncles are those which bear the female 

 blossoms. Another interesting fact is that tbe number of male flowers is less 

 in those heads which also bear a female, than in those which are wholly 

 staminate. This seems to add to the point I made in my paper on Ambrósia, 

 that after the flowers have been partially formed in embryo, and before the 

 sex has been finally determined, the female flower, being primordially the 

 stronger, has the power of absorbing the males or their partially formed ele- 

 ments into its system. It is certainly remarkable that in both these instances 

 the number of male flowers should decrease in proportion to the existence or 

 vigor of the central female one. 



The male and female flowers of Euphorbia fulgens are formed much alike. 

 The female occupies the center, and seems really but a prolongation of the 

 raain stem, on the top of which is an articulation from which the ovarium 

 springs. The capsula readily falis from this articulation when mature. From 

 the base of the female central peduncle spring weaker peduncles, colorless, 

 appearing indeed almost like filaments, articulated at about the same height 

 as the female, only above the point bearing a short filament and anther — the 

 caduceous part before referred to. No one can fail to see the correspondence 

 ef plan in these different parts, and I think that nothing but the favorable 

 position in the direct line of axial vigor made the central flower a female one. 



Cases occasionally occur in which a tolerably strong head of wholly male 

 flowers will develop the central axis into a pedicel almost as long and vigorous 

 as those which bear female flowers. But the flow of vital force — if 1 am correct 

 in using this terra — not being quite suíficient, the final goal of natural per- 

 fection in the female ferm was not reached. These cases do not occur often, 

 but are well worth looking for, as they show so clearly the dividing line be- 

 tween the forces which govern the male or female sex. 



Note on the Relations of SYNOCLAJDIA, King, 1849, to the Propcsed Genus 

 SEPTOPORA, Prout, 1858.* 



BY F. B. MEEK AND A. H. WORTHEN, 



Of the Illinois Stale Geological Surrey, 

 Not having studied the Polyzoa of our rocks, it was only recently that we 

 noticed lhe remarkable agreement between the fóssil from the Chester division 

 ef the Lower Carboniferous, on which Dr. Prout proposed to found a genus 

 Septopora, and the comraon Western Coal-measure species, that has been by 

 some referred to the European Permian species, Synocladia virgulacea, the type 

 of Prof. King's genus Synocladia. In identifying this fóssil, from beds in Kan- 

 sas referred by him to the lower Permian, with S. virgulacea, Prof. Swallow 

 noticed that it ditfers frora*the foreign species in having only two, or, on some 

 parts, apparently three,f rows of cellules to each of the longitudinal branches, 

 instead of from three to five rows, as in the latter; and although he referred 

 the Western species doubtfully to S. virgulacea, he proposed for it the pro- 

 visional name, S. biserialis, in case the differences noted should be considered 

 of specific importance.J Prof. Geinitz, however, did not consider these differ- 

 ences of full specific value, and referred the species to S. virgulacea.^

 arranged that they might be counted so as to appear to make three rows, the proper 

 number of rows being only two.

16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



After a careful comparison of a series of good specimens, showing clearly 

 both sides, of the fóssil on which Dr. Prout proposed to found his genus Septopora 

 (S. Cestriensis, Prout), from the original locality in the Chester limestone of 

 the Lower Carboniferous, with an equally well preserved series of the Coal- 

 measure fóssil raentioned above, that has been referred to S. virgulacea, we find 

 that they not only agree exactly in ali generic characters, but that we have, up 

 to this time, been entirely unable to discover any specific differences. We ob- 

 serve, it is true, among the Coal-measure specimens, some differences in the 

 greater or less size, and irregularity of divergence of the branches, and conse- 

 quent differences in the sizes and forms of the fenestrules ; but the same dif- 

 ferences are also observable among the specimens from the Chester beds, so 

 that if we were to regard these as specific differences, we would have to admit 

 several species to be common to the two horizons, instead of only one. 



We have for a long time been aware of the fact that the form that has been 

 referred to 8. virgulacea, from the Kansas and Nebraska rocks, not only ranges 

 through the beds included by some as lower Permian in Kansas, but that it 

 has an extensive vertical and geographical range in the admitted Coal-raeas- 

 ures of these States and Iowa. We are also now prepared to show that it 

 not only ranges through the whole of the Coal-measures of Illinois, but that, 

 as above stated, specimens beyond ali doubt belonging to the same genus, and, 

 as we believe, to the very same species, occur both in the St. Louis and Chester 

 beds of the Lower Carboniferous limestone series. We were slow to adopt 

 the conclusion that the specimens from these different horizons are really spe- 

 cifically identical, because we have so often, in such cases, on examining bet- 

 ter collections than those first obtained, succeeded in finding differences not 

 previously supposed to exist. In this instance, however, as well as occasion- 

 ally in others, we have, as already mentioned, found the specimens to agree 

 exactly in apparently ali of their specific characters. 



In regard to the generic relations of this fóssil to the genus Synocladia, as 

 typified by the common European Permian true S. virgulacea, there may be differ 

 ences of opinion between some of those who draw very exact distinctioDS be- 

 tween genera, and others who give them greater latitude. That they really 

 belong to the same genus, however, we can scarcely entertain any doubts, 

 though it must be admitted that they are certainly distinguished on very 

 nearly the same kind and degree of differences that distinguish Fetiestella from 

 Polypora. 



It is a little remarkable that Dr. Prout, who made an especial study of the 

 palaeozoic Polyzoa, should have failed to notice the very close relations be- 

 tween his Septopora and Synocladia, at the same time that he assigned to the 

 former almost exactly the same characters mentioned by Prof. Kingin describ- 

 ing his genus Synocladia. This identity of generic characters in these two 

 species will be better understood by comparing the original generic descrip- 

 tions of these forms as given by Prof. King and Dr. Prout, making, of course, 

 some allowance for differences of terminology. Prof. King's description of 

 Synocladia (see Brit. Permian Foss. p. 38) reads as follows : — 



"A foliaceous or frondiferous infundibuliform Fenestellidia. Fronds con- 

 sisting of numerous connecting stems or ribs. Stems bifurcating ; radiating 

 from a small ròot ; running parallel to, and at short distances from each other, 

 on one plane; and giving off bilaterally numerous short, simple branches 

 [dissepiment], of which opposite pairs conjoin midway between its stems, 

 arcuately or at an ascendiag angle. Branches occasionally modified into 

 stems. Cellules on the inner or upper surface of the fronds ; on both stems 

 and branches ; imbricated, and distributed in longitudinal series. Series of 

 cellules separated from each other by a dividing ridge. (?)Gemmuliferou8 

 vesicles on the dividing ridge." 



He farther adds that this genus differs from the allied genera, in the arching 

 and celluliferous character of its connecting branches, or dissepimenls, and the fact 

 that they are sometimes developed into intermediate radiating branches or stems. It 



[March, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 17 



will also be observed tbat be does not mention the number of rows of cellules 

 or pores in eacb radial brancb or stem, in his generic description, thougb lie 

 does so in describing the species ; from which it is evident tbat be did not re- 

 gard that as a generic cbaracter, and that he would bave considered tbe 

 American type as belonging to another species of tbe sarae genus. 



For comparison with the above, we give below Dr. Prout's description of his 

 proposed genus Septopora, from the Transactions of the Acad. Sei. of St. 

 Louis, vol. I. p. 448 : — 



" Bryozoum a fan-like expansion, with longitudinal ribs [stems of Prof. 

 King], irregular in size, radiating from a centre, branching and occasionally 

 anastomosing, having two lines of pores, one on each side of a tuberculated 

 midrib."* Dissepiments forming arches. or more or less angular, dividing the 

 Bryozoum into quadrangular, round, semi-lunar, or rhombic fenestrules ; each 

 dissepiment supporting from one to four irregular lines of cell-pores ; reverse 

 smooth when worn, but more or less tubercled when perfect."f 



He adds that, " thougb in its general features it resembles Fenestella, it dif- 

 fers in a marked degree by its celluliferous dissepiments." This, it will be 

 observed, together with the arched, or angulated character of its dissepiments, and 

 thefact that they sometimes give origin to intermédia te branches, or sterms, as Prof. 

 King terms them, were exactly the characters mentioned by the latter author 

 as distinguishing Synocladia from other allied Fenestellidse. Altbough Dr. 

 Prout does not mention tbe character of the angulated dissepiments giving 

 off intermediate branches, his figure 2 a, pi. 18, of the St. Louis transactions 

 cited, distinctly shows it, and it is even more strongly defined in specimens 

 now before us, from the original locality, and identified by Dr. Prout himself. 

 It is also worthy of note, that Dr. Prout's enlarged figures, 2 b and 2 c, of the 

 plate above cited, do not give a correet idea of this fóssil, as may be seen by 

 comparison with his own description. Figure 2 c, for instance, represents the 

 fenestrules proportionally much too small, and the dissepiments too thick 

 and not in the slightest degree "forming arches, or more or less angular." 

 Figure 2 b also fails to show this arching or bending upward of the dissepi- 

 ments, and tbe "tubercles" or vesicles on the midrib, which characters are as 

 strongly defined in the Chester and Coal-measure specimens as in Prof. King's 

 figures of the typical S. virgulacea. Some portions of the celluliferous surface 

 near the base of the frond might be selected from some specimens that would 

 nearly agree with these figures given by Dr. Prout, but this is far from the 

 general character of the fóssil farther up, where the branches are more diverg- 

 ing, so as to form larger fenestrules. 



The question respecting the relations of these Western specimens, from the 

 several horizons mentioned, to each other, and to the European Permian Syno- 

 cladia virgulacea, is, for other reasous, one of more interest and importance 

 than the mere difference or identity of particular fossils, since it involves the 

 question of the duration in time, and the consequent geological range, of one 

 of the most important of the types that bave been appealed to as evidence 

 that the Permian should be carried down in Kansas and Nebraska, so as to 

 include several hundred feet of rocks regarded by us and others as belonging 

 to the true Coal-measures. Whethcr we regard this fóssil as being specifi- 

 cally identical with Synocladia virgulacea (which we do not admit), or view it ' 

 as a distinct species of the same genus, it is now evident that it can no longer 

 be regarded as properly a Permian type; for, even if it could be shovvn to be 

 only a variely of S. virgulacea, it would still be a form unknown in the Permian 

 of Europe; while here it is, as above shown, not only one of our most abun- 

 daat Coal-measure types, but one that began its existence during the deposi- 

 tion of lower Carboniferous or Mountain limestone series. 



* The midrib mentioned liere is the "dividing ridge" of Prof. King, and the "tubercles" 

 on it are the "(?;gemmuliferous vesicles" 1 of Prof. King.

 examples from the original locality.

It is worthy of note in this connection, that there are various other fossils 

 in the upper members of our lower Carboniferous series that might with quite 

 as much propriety be referred to European Permian species as many of the 

 Western Coal-measure types that have been so referred. For instance, Dr. 

 Prout long since (Trans. St. Louis Acad. Sciences, vol. I. p. 450) identified a 

 Polypora, from the Ch éster beds, with the Russian Permian P. biarmica; while 

 several other species of Polyzoa found in the Chester group are scarcely dis- 

 tinguishable from forms found in western beds that have been by some in- 

 cluded in the Permian. We also nowknowthat there are species of Schizodus, 

 Pleurophorus, etc., in the Chester beds very like Permian forms ; while a Cri- 

 noid, found by Prof. Marcou in beds in Nebraska (referred by him to the Per- 

 mian), and thought by him to be " extremely near Encrinus moniliformis, Miller, 

 of the Muschelkalk of Europe," is now known to range through the whole of 

 the Western Coal-measures, and to be represented in the Chester lime3tone 

 beneath the Millstone-grit by closely allied species. Indeed, a number of 

 Crinoids that have been recently discovered in the Chester beds and the Coal- 

 measnres of Illinois are remarkably similar representative forms. Even the 

 curious Zeacrinus mucrospinus of McChesney, from the Upper Coal-measures of 

 Illinois, has irs nearly allied representative in the Chester limestone below 

 the Millstone-grit. 



Numerous facts like the foregoing (such, for instance, as the occurrence of 

 Tertiary types of plants in the Nebraska Cretaceous), might be cited to show 

 that in many instances particular forms of life, both animal and vegetable, 

 appeared here at earlier periods than in the old world. Hence, great caution, 

 and some general knowledge of the entire fauna and flora of our rocks, are 

 often required in order to arrive at sound conclusion with regard to their re- 

 lations to particular horizons of the series, as made out in Europe.

 Twenty-three members present. 



Professor Leidy made the following remarks on Discosaurus and its Al- 

 ues. 



The body of the last vértebra in the series of caudais belonging to the Kan- 

 sas saurian, described by Prof. Cope under the name of Elasmosaurus, has the 

 length less than the depth or breadth, which latter is the greatest diameter. 

 It is moderately contracted towards the middle, the sides below the neural 

 arch and the surface below the costal articulations being fore and aft concave, 

 and bounded in front and behind by an acute margin from the articular ends. 

 A ridge extends fore and aft between the chevron articulations and the in- 

 cluded surface is concave, and exhibits a single lateral venous foramen. The 

 costal articular processes project from the middle of the side of the body, 

 reaching nearer the fore than the back end of the latter. They are transversely 

 oval, about three-fourths the length of the body, and the height about half. 

 They form a deep concavity, with acute margins expanding peripheralíy. 

 The articular ends of the body are transversely oval and defined from the 

 intermediate portion of the latter by an acute everted margin. A short dis- 

 tance within the position of the latter the surface is marked by a narrow 

 groove, and within the circle of this groove the surface projects in such a manner 

 as to appear like a distinct disk or epiphysial plate applied to and eoõssified 

 with the body. The surface of the disk is convex at the periphery and 

 moderately concave towards the centre. The articular surface beyond the 

 groove definingthe disk appears as an everted ledge, and the triangular articu- 

 lar facets for the chevrons appear as deflections of the ledge. The extension 

 of the latter inferiorly is greater at the posterior extremity of the body than 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PH1LADELPHIA. 19 



at the anterior extremity, thus producing a larger provision of surface in tliat 

 position for the articulation of the chevron. The neural arch in the specimen 

 has apparently been so much laterally compressed, that its original condition 

 cannot be ascertained. 



It was upon several similar isolated vertebrae to the one just described that the 

 genus Discosaurus was established, and I shall now proceed to examine them 

 comparatively with the object of determining their relationship with the Kan- 

 sas saurian. 



The genus Discosaurus was originally indicated from a mutilated body of a 

 caudal vértebra from the eretaceous formation of Alabama (Proc. Acad. Nat. 

 Sei. 1851, 326). In its imperfect condition, its peculiar character, and resem- 

 blance to a vértebra represented, by Prof. Owen, as a cervical of Plesiosaurut 

 pachyomus (British Fóssil Reptiles, pi. 28,) it was mistaken for a cervical. 

 The specimen, together with another from the same individual, were described 

 in their true position, as relates to the regions of the vertebral column, in the 

 " Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States." They are represented in figs. 4. 

 5, 6, pi. v, of that work. The two vertebral bodies bear a near resemblance 

 with that of the Kansas saurian above described. They nave nearly the same 

 proportions, and are slightly smaller and rather less contracted intermediately. 

 The interchevron ridges are comparatively less well developed. The discoid 

 arrangement of the articular ends is even more conspicuous. The disks are 

 more prominent, more decidedly defined from the ledge beyond by a deeper 

 constriction or groove. The periphery of the disks is rather more convex, and 

 the surface towards the centre slightly less concave. The ontside ledge is 

 comparatively narrow and is not everted. The chevron articular surfaces ap- 

 pear rather to be produced through deflections of the groove defining the disk. 

 than by an extension of the ledge, so that the chevrons would appear to have 

 articulated with the depressed margin of the disk itself instead of with the 

 ledge. The neural arch is broken away in both specimens, except part of an 

 abutment in one of them. 



The slight difference in size of these vértebra? from that of the Kansas 

 saurian, as well as the feebler produetion of the interchevron ridges, might 

 readily be due to their more posterior position in the column. The more de- 

 cided constriction of the disks at the articular extremeties from the rest of the 

 body, which led to the application of the name of Discosaurus, might be re- 

 garded as an individual peculiarity, or a variation in specific character; whicb 

 is often greater than real specific or even generic characters. 



A similar vértebra, from the lower cretaceous of Mississippi, represented in 

 figs. 10 — 12, pi. v of the " Cretaceous Reptiles of the United states," likewise 

 referred to Discosaurus, has the same size and proportions as that above de- 

 scribed of the Kansas saurian. In its anatomical characters it is intermediate 

 to the latter, and those of the Alabama saurian. The interchevron ridges are 

 intermediate in degree of development. The most marked difference exists at 

 the articular ends of the body. The articular surface is comparatively flat, 

 being but feebly depressed towards the centre and as feebly rounded towards 

 the periphery, which extends to the acute margin definiug it from the sides of 

 the body, almost without the intervention of a groove such as is described in 

 the preceding specimens. A slight deflection in the course of the acute 

 border defines the anterior chevron articulation. The posterior chevron ar- 

 ticulation is comparatively large and more distinctly defined than the corres- 

 ponding one in the Kansas and Alabama specimens. The sides of the neural 

 arch ascend in a steep slope from the more concave sides of the body, sweep- 

 ing outwardly to the upper border of the costai pit. The diaineter of the 

 spinal canal is about seven lines. 



Another vertebral body, from the cretaceous formation of New Jersey, re- 

 ferred to Discosaurus, is represented in figs. 7 — 9 of the work above indicated. 

 It presents characters in common with the preceding specimens, but likewise 

 has peculiarities of a decided kind. It approaches most the Alabama speci- 



1870.] 




20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



niens, and has nearly the same size. Tnterchevron ridges are entirely obsolete, 

 The articular extremities of the body are very like those of the Alabama 

 specimens, but the groove defining them from the acute margin is very incon- 

 spicuous or nearly obsolete. The deflections of the acute margin for the ac- 

 commodation of chevrons are comparatively and remarkably deep, especially 

 those anteriorly. The spinal canal at the orifices is about seren lines wide ; 

 at the middle scarcely five lines. 



In ali the specimens above indicated, a single venous foramen is situated on 

 the under side of the body, to the right of the median line.

We thus have the nearly corresponding caudal vertebrse of four individuais, 

 from the cretaceous formation of as many different localities, agreeing nearly 

 in size, proportions, form, and construction, but exhibiting decided peculiari- 

 ties in every case. Are these peculiarities to be considered of generic and 

 specific value ; of specific value alone : or are they to be regarded as varia- 

 tions in the characters of a single species? From the specimens alone I 

 would incline to view them in the latter light, though I admit that each 

 variation may represent a different genus, or a different species of the same 

 genus. The reason for referring any one to a genus is equally good for ali. 

 If the Alabama specimens be regarded as characteristic of JJiscosaurus, and 

 the Kansas one of Ulasmosaurus, the caudal from Mississippi, with its nearly 

 flat ends, is quite as characteristic of a third genus, and the New Jersey caudal, 

 with its peculiarities, would form a fourth. The close correspondence in size 

 of the specimens rather favors the view that they ali pertain to the same 

 species, though this maybe as coincidental as the discovery of the nearly cor- 

 responding vértebra in the four cases. The one which, in my view, is raost 

 distinctive from the others, is the specimen from Mississippi, with the nearly 

 flat articular extremities of its body. It may be well to consider it as repre- 

 senting a species, and for this one I propose the name of Discosaurus planior. 



A vértebra, which accompanied the Discosauroid caudal from New Jersey, 

 from its appearance was supposed to belong to the same individual. It was 

 regarded as a posterior cervical, and is represented in figs. 1-3, pi. v, and 

 described on page 24 of the "Cretaceous Reptiles." It would appear by com- 

 parison rather to be an anterior caudal, and so far as I can judge in the im- 

 perfect condition of the specimens, resembles most nearly the fifth of the last 

 continuous series of twenty-two vertebrae of the Kansas skeleton. It appears 

 to agree nearly in form, constitution, and proportions with the corresponding 

 boné of the latter, but is rather smaller. 



Some years since I had the opportunity of inspecting some vertebral speci- 

 mens of a huge saurian in the possession of Mr. W. F. Roberts, who obtained 

 them from near Greenville, Clark Co., Arkansas. They are supposed to be of 

 cretaceous age, as the formation of that period is the prevailing one in the 

 locality in which they were found. Two of the best preserred of the speei- 

 mens, generally very imperfect, were briefly noticed in the Proceedings for 

 1854, page 72, and represented in figs. 1-3, pi. ii. The remains were observed 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPIHA. 21 



to bear a resemblance to those of Cimoliasaurus, and were referred to an ani- 

 mal with the name of Brimosaurus granais. Through comparison with the 

 skeleton of the Kansas saurian / they appear to be posterior cervicais, and 

 further appear sufficiently near in character to belong to the same, though 

 their larger size renders it probable that they pertained to a larger species. 



A question arises as to the relationship of those remains originally referred 

 to Cimoliasaurus with Discosaurus in the present state of our knowledge of the 

 latter. In the first place, by comparison with the skeleton of the Kansas 

 saurian, we observe that the position in the column, assigned to the vertebral 

 bodies of Cimoliasaurus, was incorrect, and this probably contributed to mislead 

 Prof. Cope in his examination of the skeleton of the Kansas saurian. 



The vertebral specimens referred to Cimoliasaurus consisted of two sets of 

 specimens, from two different individuais, both from the green sand of Bur- 

 lington Co., N. J. They are described in "Cretaceous Reptiles," page 25, and 

 characteristic ones represented in plates v. and vi. 



The eleven vertebrae considered as lurabar, and represented by figs. 17-19. 

 pi. v, and 16-18, pi. vi, are evidently cervicais. Those considered as dorsais 

 on page 26, and represented in figs. 13-16, pi. v, are at least in part posterior 

 cervicais. Of the fourteen vértebra? referred to on page 27 as dorsais and lum- 

 bars, those described and represented in figs. 1-5, pi. vi, are alone dorsais, while 

 the others described and represented in figs. 6-9 are posterior, and those of 

 figs. 10-18 more anterior cervicais. 



The cervicais of Cimoliasaurus are so different in their proportions from 

 those of the Kansas saurian that there can be no question as to the distinction 

 of the two animais, at least as species. 



Do ali the remains originally referred to Discosaurus belong to this genus as 

 distinct from Cimoliasaurus? I suspect that those from New Jersey belong to 

 the latter. The animais indicated by ali the fossils which have been under 

 consideration are Plesiosauroid, and as in recognized species of Plesiosaurus 

 there is much variability in the number, proportions, and other characters of 

 the cervicais without a corresponding extent of variation in other parts of the 

 vertebral column, we would be prepared to find in Cimoliasaurus nearly the 

 same kind of caudais as in Discosaurus. 



Prof. Cope, in his "Synopsis of the Ext. Batrachia and Reptilia," pt. i, 1869, 

 p. 56, describes two vertebral specimens from the lower bed of the cretaceous 

 green sand of Gloucester and Monmouth counties, which he attributes to a 

 species with the name of Elasmosaurus oriental**. The specimens described 

 as caudais are seen, by comparison with the Kansas skeleton, to be cervicais. 



The smaller of the two specimens is intermediate in its form, proportions, 

 and size with what appear to be the nearly corresponding vértebra? of the Kan- 

 sas saurian, and the vértebra? referred to Cimoliasaurus. The larger specimen 

 I have not seen, but from the description and measurements given it would 

 appear to have belonged to a species quite as large as the Kansas saurian. 

 The comparative measurements of the two specimens with that of the Kan- 

 sas saurian, which appears to be most like them, and with the largest of the 

 specimens which had been referred to Cimoliasaurus, are as follow :

The various remains to which I have referred in this communication proba- 

 bly indicate a number of different species of a genus, presenting a like varia- 

 bility in the number and proportioas of the cervicais as has been observed 

 in the closely related genus Flesiosaurus. In the present condition of knowl- 

 edge of the remains, they appear to me to be referable to a series of species 

 as follow :

In the cervicais of Discosaurus, so far as can be ascertained by the material 

 at comraand, there appears to be no subdivision of the articular process for 

 the riblets, as in Plesiosaurus. In the latter the chevron bonés consist of 

 lateral halves, ununited by osseous tissue. In the skeleton of the Kansas sau- 

 rian, intervening between two of the caudais, there is a boné which looks as 

 if it might be an inverted Y-shaped chevron, with one arm broken oíf. The 

 spine broken at the end is about four inches long. The remaining arm, broken 

 away at the articular end, is about three inches long.

 appearance it perhaps most nearly agrees with a form found in the Galena 

 Limestone, and referred by us, doubtfully, to R. globularis, Hall, in the third 

 vol. Illinois Geol. Reports, pi. 2, fig. 2 a,b. It differs, however, from that 

 species in having the upper end more round, or less depressed, and without 

 any umbilicoid impression. Its cell impressions are also very different, not 

 being near so crowded, and instead of becoming more crowded and narrower 

 on the lower half, they are less so there than above ; while the central per- 

 foration of each is much smailer.

 Body attaining a large size, rather deeply cup-shaped, though wider than

 basin-shaped. Basal pieces rather large. nearly twice as wide as high, penta- 

 gonal in form, with the mesial angle above deeply impressed, the impression 

 being also continued down the middle to the lower edge, with a broad promi- 

 nence or ridge on each side of it also extending to the lower edge, where 

 each of these prominences terminates in a little angular projection, while the 

 lateral margins are strongly and abruptly beveled, so as to form deep, wide 

 notches at the sutures. Subradial pieces large, hexagonal, excepting one on 

 the anal side, which is heptagonal ; ali very profoundly impressed at the cor- 

 ners, so as to form strong, radiating ridges, extending one to each of the sides, 

 to connect with those on the other contiguous plates ; sometimes these ridges 

 terminate in pinched-up nodes on the central region. First radial pieces 

 about twice as wide as high, being generally a little wider than the subradials, 

 pentagonal in form, with superior lateral angles more or less truncated, and 

 slightly projecting at the edge, each with its broad, very shallow sinus above, 

 for the reception of the second radiais, more than three-fourths as wide as its 

 upper margin, while the deep impression at the lower angles form two broad, 

 very strong ridges, extending downward to connect with those on the sub- 

 radials ; sometimes these terminate near the middle above, in sharp pinched- 

 up, diverging nodes, or short carinae, while between these and the superior 

 lateral, truncated angles, one or two other sharp prominences are sometimes 

 seen. Second radial pieces extremely short, or almost transversely linear, 

 and not always entirely filling the broad shallow sinuses in which they rest. 

 Third radiais triangular, a little higher in the middle than the first, but 

 wedging to a very thin edge on each side, or even sometimes thinning out so as 

 to let the first brachial pieces rest, at the lateral ends partly upon the first and 

 partly on the second radiais. Anal pieces of moderate size, quadrangular in 

 form, a little wider than high, and resting on the upper truncated edge of the 

 heptagonal subradial, while its own upper edge is truncated entirely across, 

 nearly on a levei with the superior lateral angles of the first radial on each 

 side of it.

 below, where they are composed of thin (short) wide pieces, the first two of 

 which, in each pair of arms, are joined together at their inner ends ; above 

 tliese the arras of each ray diverge more or less from each other, and throw 

 off alternalely on each side stont armlets from every second piece. Arm 

 pieces above the wide ones at the base, somewhat longer in proportion to 

 breadth than the latter, and more or less wedge formed, with each a little 

 pinched or angnlar ridge or projection on each side, ranging transversely to 

 the arms. Armlets stout, about eight to nine on each side of each arm, near 

 half as thick as the arras just above the points where the two connect ; com- 

 posed of pieces of nearly the same form as the arm pieces, but generally show- 

 ing a slight disposition to become a little zigzag, and, at least some of them, 

 throwing off alternately on each side a series of smaller secondary armlets, 

 exactly as they are themselves given off from the main arms. Secondary 

 armlets showing a slight zigzag appearance, from the greater tbickness and 

 prominence of every second piece on opposite sides, so as to appear as if they 

 may give off a tertiary series of armlets, or pinnulse, though the specimen does 

 not show these if they exist. 



Column very stout, nearly round, and composed, at least for about three 

 inches or more below the base, of alternately thin and somewhat thicker 

 pieces, the latter of which project outward a little beyond the others, and 

 show a slight disposition to become nodular, or irregularly thickened on the 

 edge. Internai cavity large, with an obtusely pentagonal section. Longitu- 

 dinal sutures, dividing the column into five sections, partly anchylosed, but 

 still visible. 



Height of bod} r , about 1 inch ; breadth, about 1-70 inches ; length of arms, 

 3-80 inches ; thickness of do. at the base, 0-40 inch ; thickness of column near 

 base, 0-60 inch. 



This fine large species seeras to be most nearly allied to D. Thomx, (= Cya- 

 thocrinus Thomm, Hall), from the Warsaw Limestone, but diífers in having the 

 impressions at the corners of its body plates, and the ridges between the same, 

 greatly more strongly defined, and its arms much stouter, and more rounded 

 below. Its column is also proportionally thicker, with a more obtusely pen- 

 tagonal internai cavity. The typical specimens of the B. Thomce, which are 

 now before us, are not in a condition to show much of the arms, but as far as 

 they can be seen, they seem to be proportionally more slender, and we can 

 scarcely doubt that they will show other corresponding differences in the de- 

 tails of their structure, when better specimens can be compared. We have 

 ascertained, however, that the arm-pieces of the typical specimens of B. 

 Thomx have on their sides little pinched-up prominences, as in the species 

 here described, which character was not mentioned in the description of that 

 species. 



The peculiarity of having the corners of the body plates impressed so as to 

 form large ridges on the plates is very common in this group, but it diífers in 

 degree, or otherwise, in the various species, presenting corresponding differ- 

 ences in other parts. It is more strongly defined in the species here described, 

 and the ridges more angular than in any other known to us. This species is 

 also the first of the group in which we have clearly seen secondary armlets 

 springing from the sides of the larger ones given off from each side of the 

 arras; but since seeing this character in this species, we think we have been 

 able to detect indications of it in others. 



We hope those who may not be disposed to admit the genus Barycrinus as 

 distinct from Cyathocrinns, will at least write the name of this species Cyatho- 

 crinus {Barycrinus) speclabilis.

trscted above. Basal plates of moderate size, pentagonal in form. and spread 

 out horizontally so as to form a nearly flat pentagonal disc, excepting that the 

 salient angles are curved upward a little ; facet for the attachment of the 

 column small, compared with the size of the base, round and not impressed 

 Subradial plates large, forming the widest part of the body, convex on the 

 outside, but not from thickening ; about as wide as long, hexagonal, with 

 perhaps the exception of one on the anal side of heptagonal form ; ali curving 

 under below to connect with the base. First radiais somewhat srnaller than 

 the subradials, wider than long, pentagonal in form, and provided above with 

 very small, shallow sinuses for the reception of the second, whieh are small, 

 but more than filling the shallow little sinuses. Third radiais, in two of the 

 arms seen, small, and bearing on each of their superior sloping sides, a long, 

 very slender, subcarinated arm, which bifurcates on the second pieee above ; 

 while the divergent divisions subdivide two or three times again above, at in- 

 tervals of three or four pieces ; the divisious and subdivisions ali being very 

 slender, and composed of joints about twice as long as wide. In two of the 

 rays seen, however, the free arms are simple from their origin on the first 

 radiais, at least as far up as to the sixth piece, inclusive, (which is as far as 

 they can be traced in the specimen), and present the remarkable character of 

 having the second, third and fourth pieces greatly dilated, or alate on each 

 side, so as to be nearly two-thirds as broad as the whole body below ; though 

 the first piece next the body (second radial), is narrow, and nearly twice as 

 long as wide, as are the fifth and sixth pieces. Surface smooth, or only finely 

 granular; sutures close fitting, or not channeled. Anal plate and column 

 unknown. 



Height of body, 0-20 inch ; breadth of do., 0-34 inch ; breadth of the dilated 

 part of one of the simple arms, about 0-22 inch. 



It is possible that the dilated arms may bifurcate above the sixth piece, 

 though the specimen from which the description is made out is not in a con- 

 dition to enable us to settle this point. The fact that they become suddenly 

 narrow above the fourth piece, would seem to indicate that they may possibly 

 assume the character of the other arms farther up. As seen lying partly 

 imbedded in the matrix, with the long-jointed, slender arms and their branches 

 incurved, above the little globular body, the whole reminds one very much of 

 the Jurassic genus Saccosoma, Agassiz. 



The very remarkable characters of the arms in this little crinoid, if not due 

 to abnormal development, would certainly seem to warrant its separation, at 

 least subgenerically, from the typical forms of Cyathocrinites. Tt also seems 

 very improbable that its ventral disc is constructed as in the typical forms of 

 that genus. Should other specimens show the peculiarities we have men- 

 tioned to be normal, we would propose for this type the generic or subgen- 

 eric name Saccosomopsis. 



Specifically this form, at least so far as regards its body, seems to be exactly 

 like a species described by Prof. Hall, under the name Cyaihocrinus parvibra- 

 chiatus (Jour. Bost. Soe. Nat. Hist.., Vol. vii, p. 395, 1861) ; and it is worthy 

 of note, that he describes its " subrachial " or free radial pieces as being 

 " two to each ray, broad and strong, but varying in the different rays." As 

 these pieces " vary in the different rays/' may not those he saw, that were broad 

 and strong, have belonged to dilated simple rays, as in our species, and these 

 rays been broken off above the second pieces, in the specimen described? If 

 so, his species would almost certainly belong to the same group as ours, but 

 differs specifically in having its bifurcating arms shorter, more rapidly dimin- 

 ishing in size, with shorter pieces between the bifurcations, so as to bring the 

 subdivisions closer together ; also in having larger and deeper sinuses in its 

 first radiais for the reception of the second. 



We are much inclined to believe there is a little group of species having 

 essentially the form of body, and the peculiarities of the arms we have de- 

 scribed, and that it will probably include Cyathocrinites Saffordi, the arms of 

 which are unknown.

Potbriocrinites (Zeacrinus?) concinnds, M. and W. 



Body wider than high, rather rapidly expanding upward from the column. 

 Base small, basin-shaped, about three times as wide as high, and truncated 

 about three-fourths its breadth below by the facet for the attachment of the 

 column. Basal pieces wider than high, pentagonal in form, and expanding 

 upward from the column, which is rather stout, rouud, and composed near the 

 base of thin pieces. Subradials of moderate size, not thickened or tumid, 

 four hexagonal, and one on the anal side heptagonal. First radiais as wide 

 as the subradials, but shorter, pentagonal, and truncated their entire breadth 

 above. Second radiais as wide as the first, but scarcely more than half as 

 long, ali transversely oblong in form. Third radiais in the posterior and 

 anterior lateral rays, of nearly the same size and form as the first, but of 

 course with the sloping sides above. On these sloping sides they each sup- 

 port two unequal arms, the posterior one of which in one of the posterior 

 lateral rays is smaller than the other, and can be seen to bifurcate on the 

 fourth piece, while the other bifurcates on the second piece, and its subdi- 

 visions divide again at various distances above, several times, so as to make 

 altogether about thirteen or more subdivisions in this ray. The anterior main 

 division of one of the anterior lateral rays can also be seen to bifurcate on 

 the fifth piece above the third radial, and one of its branches subdivides at 

 different distances above into three subdivision9, and the other into four. 

 Anterior ray simple to the eighth piece, the pieces between the first and last 

 being short and somewhat wedge-form, while the last is pentagonal and sup- 

 ports two arms, each of which can be seen to bifurcate at least once some 

 distance above. Anal pieces with the usual double alternating arrangement, 

 the lowest piece being obliquely inserted between the upper sloping sides of 

 two of the subradials, and partly under one side of one of the first radiais, 

 while a contiguous piece on the left above is supportedon an upper truncated 

 side of one of the subradials, and the latter are succeeded by others that con- 

 nect with the base of the proboscis. 



Arms long, slender, very straight, and gradually tapering ; slightly convex 

 on the dorsal surface, and fiattened so as to fit closely together on each side, 

 with ali their divisions running up parallel, or showing scarcely any divergence 

 at the bifurcations, and ali composed of short wedge-formed pieces ; axillary 

 pieces not more protuberant than the others. Pinnulae small, and arising one 

 from the upper part of the longer side of each arm piece, alternately on each 

 side, and rather closely approximated to each other. 



Surface, in well preserved specimens, finely and obscurely granular, the 

 granules showing on the arms (as seen under a magnifier) a tendency to 

 arrange themselves in longitudinal rows, or to assume vermicular fornis. 

 Sutures between ali the pieces merely linear. 



Entire length of arms and body, 2-80 inches; height of body to the top of 

 first radiais, 0-27 inch ; breadth about 0-43 inch. Thickness of column, at its 

 connection with the base, O-IT inch. 



This species seems to combine, to some extent, the characters of Poteriocri- 

 nites and Zeacrinus. In general habit, especially in the somewhat fiattened 

 and closely contiguous characters of ali the divisions of its arms, ali around, 

 when folded together, as well as, to some extent, in their mode of division, it 

 reminds one of many species of Zeacrinus. In the form of its body, however, 

 and particularly in having three primary radiais, instead of only two, in each 

 of the anterior lateral and posterior lateral rays, and about eight below the 

 first bifurcation in the anterior ray, as well as in the general form of its body, 

 it agrees more nearly with the typical forms of Poteriocrinites. We know of

Scaphiocrinus depressus, M. and W. 



Body small, somewhat basin-shaped, about twice as wide as high to the top 

 of the first radiais, broadly truncated and concave below, with but slightly 

 expanded or nearly vertical sides. Base occupying the concavity of the under 

 side, and apparently flat or concave. First radial pieces about as high as 

 wide, a little convex, rising vertically, except below, where they curve ab- 

 ruptly inwards to connect with the base ; ali seen, presenting pentagonal gen- 

 eral outlines on their outer faces. First radial pieces nearly twice as wide as 

 high, pentagonal in form, and truncated their entire breadth above for the 

 reception of the second radiais. Anal pieces unknown. Second radiais 

 longer than wide, strongly constricted in the middle with steeply sloping sides 

 for the support of the arms above. Arms simple from their origin on the 

 second radiais, slender, and composed of long, rounded, somewhat constricted 

 joints, which are obliquely truncated at the ends, with the upper end of ali 

 projecting, alternately on opposite sides for the support of long, very slender 

 tentacles, composed of long joints. 



Breadth of body, near 0-30 inch ; height, 0-15 inch. Arms apparently 

 about 1-12 inches in length, and only 0-05 inch in thickness at the constricted 

 part of one of the lower joints; first four joints 0-32 in length. 



In its depressed body, with nearly vertical sides, and broadly truncated, 

 concave lower part, this species seems to resemble S. unicus, of Hall, as near 

 as can be determined from a description alone. It differs, however, in having 

 the arms simple from their origin on the second radiais, with long instead of 

 very short joints. It is peculiar in the broadly truncated and concave char- 

 acter of its under side, as well as in the slenderness of its arms and pinnulae. 

 The latter are also remarkably distant from each other, owing to the length 

 of the arm joints. 



Locality and position. Crawfordsville. Indiana. From the Keokuk division

Zeacrinus? armiger. 



Body small and depressed, or nearly basin-shaped, but with the under side 

 rounded, and concave in the middle. Base very small and nearly or quite 

 hidden in the concavity of the under side. Subradial pieces comparatively 

 large and curving under below, but not tumid or convex; three with a general 

 pentagonal outline, but probably having a sixth obtuse angle at the middle of 

 each below; the other two, on the anal side, presenting a general hexagonal 

 form, but truncated by the anal pieces in such a manner as to present a hep- 

 tagonal forra, exclusive of the very obtuse angle probably existing at the 

 middle of the under side of each. First radial pieces twice as wide as high, 

 pentagonal in form, and truncated across their entire breadth. Second radi- 

 ais as high as wide, each bearing two arms on their superior sloping sides, 

 and developed into a long, slender, rounded, mucronate spine, which is 

 directed nearly horizontally outward. Anal pieces small, and arranged in a 

 double alternating series, the first on lowest piece being somewhat cuneiform 

 and wedged obliquely down between one of the subradials and the under side 

 of the first radial on the left, so as to touch, by a very short side, the next 

 subradial on the left ; second anal piece resting on the short truncated sum- 

 mit of one of the heptagonal subradials, and connecting on the right with 

 one of the first radial pieces, and on the left with one of the upper sides of 

 the first anal piece, and another piece resting on the latter. Above these,

 the body. Arms unknown ; surface smooth ; sutures not impressed. 



Breadth of body, 0-39 inch ; heigbt of same to top of first radiais, 0.17 

 inch ; length of spines forraed by the extension of the second radiais, 0-40

In the peculiarity of having its second radial pieces developed into long 

 slender spines, this species agrees with Zeacrinus(?) mucrospinus of McChes- 

 ney, from the upper Coal-measures, and may be regarded as a representative 

 form of that curious Coal-measure species, in the upper part of the Lower 

 Carboniferous. It difFers, however, specifically. from Prof. McChesuey's 

 species, not only in being much smaller and more delicate, but in having its 

 subradial pieces much shorter in proportion to breadth and distinctly less 

 produced and pointed at the ends. Its anal pieces are also very differently 

 arranged. the first or lower one being wedged down obliquely under the first 

 radial on the left, instead of under that on the right of the anal series, as in 

 Z. mucrospinus. It is the first American species of the Cyathocrinidse we have 

 ever seen with this reversed arrangement of the anal series, though Prof. 

 McCoy has represented a similar arrangement of these parts in an analogous 

 form from the Carboniferous rocks of Scotland. Until the arms of this cri- 

 noid can be seen, it is not possible to determine whether or not it belongs 

 properly to the genus Zeacrinus.

Zeacrinus (Hydreionocrinus?) acanthophorus, tf. and W. 



Body below the top of the first radial pieces much depressed, or nearly 

 saucer-shaped, but concave below. Base very small and almost entirely hid- 

 den in the concavity of the under-side when the column is attached. Sub- 

 radial pieces small, four of them included in the concavity of the under side 

 and projecting horizontally outward into rather acute angles between the first 

 radiais, so as to present a subtrigonal general outline, though they are really 

 hexagonal, their lateral and inner edges being connected with each other and 

 to the base, so as to form four very short sides with five obscure angles ; fifth 

 one larger than the others, proportionally longer, and curving upward at the 

 outer end, which is truncated so as to form a short side for the support of one 

 of the anal pieces. First radial pieces comparatively large, widening rapidly 

 from below to the top, which is truncated evenly the entire breadth, and 

 about twice as wide as the greatest height, ali curving under to connect with 

 the subradials below in such a manner that the body rests upon them when 

 placed on a plane surface with the column removed. Second radiais a little 

 smaller than the first, nearly twice as wide as long, pentagonal in form, with 

 lateral mai*gins short and not constricted ; each supporting two arms on its 

 superior sloping sides. Arms rather slender for a species of this genus, not 

 being wide enough to ' be in contact laterally ali around when raised verti- 

 cally ; rounded on the dorsal side, rather rapidly tapering, and, so far as can 

 be seen in the typical specimen, ali bifurcating on the second piece ; below 

 the bifurcation the two pieces are each about as long as wide, the upper one 

 being sometimes slightly constricted around the middle ; arm piece above the 

 bifurcation rather slender, longer than wide, rounded, and distinctly con- 

 stricted around the middle. 



First anal piece about twice as long as wide, and wedged so far down under 

 one side of one of the first radiais, by the side of the largest subradial, as to 

 come nearly or quite in contact with the very small base. Second anal small 

 and resting upon the short upper end of the larger subradial, between the 

 upper part of the first anal on the right and the first radial on the left ; above^ 

 these the alternating series continues up to connect with the ventral ex- 

 tension. 



Ventral prolongation, or so-called proboscis, about equaling the apparent

length of the arms, coroparatively rather narrow and sub-cylindrical below, 

 but widening rather gradually upward above to the summit, where it fiares 

 suddenly out ali around to about the breadth of the body below, its top being 

 nearly flat, or much depressed, and composed of small, unequal, convex pieces ; 

 while each one of the marginal row of these top pieces, ali around, extends 

 horizontally outward in the forni of a sharp spine about two-thirds as long as 

 the entire transverse diameter of the flattened top itself.* Plates forming the 

 sides of the ventral portion, below its flattened spiniferous crown, probably 

 more or less costated, or sculptured, in perfect examples, but the specimen 

 seen is not in a condition to show this, though the usual pores can be seen 

 passing through the sutures between the plates. tíurface of body and arms 

 apparently smooth. 



Height of body to top of first radiais, about 0-18 inch ; breadth of do. 0-65 

 inch : height to top of ventral portion, including the body, 1-20 inches ; 

 breadth of the flattened top of the ventral portion, exclusive of the free mar- 

 ginal spines, about 0-50 inch ; whole breadth across same to the extremities 

 of the spines. 



The form of the body and the arrangeraent of the anal pieces of this species 

 are very similar to those of our Z. discus, from the Upper Coalmeasures, but 

 its under side is more decidedly concave, its first radial pieces proportionally 

 higher, and separated by decidedly deeper sutures. Its subradials are also 

 proportionally smaller. From Z? mucrospinus, of McChesney, it is at once 

 distinguished by not having its second radial pieces developed into spines, 

 and by the different structure of its arms. 



Locality and position. Fulton County. Associated with the lowest coal bed of

* On comparing this Crinoid with Prof. de Koninck's figure of the type of his genus 

 HydreionocHnus (H. Woodianus ; Buli. de 1'Academy Royale de Belgique, 2me serie, tome 

 III, pi. ii), we have been much^impressed by the remarkable resemblance of the large 

 ventral extension of its body with its depressed or flattened crown, surrounded by a se- 

 ries of marginal spines directed horizontally outward, to the part in Prof. de Kohinck's 

 type supposed by him to be formed by the lateral coalescence of the arms, in sueh a 

 manner as to form a kind of cylindrieal extension of the body upward. In our species, 

 however, there are unquestionably well developed, free arms, independent of this part. 

 It would be such an anomalous structure for a Crinoid belonging to the Cyathocrinidse, and 

 otherwise so similar to Zeacrinus and Poteriocrinitet as Hydreionocrinus is, to have no traces 

 of free arms, that we are tempted to make the inquiry, whether Prof. de Koninck's speci- 

 men may not have had its arms broken away and the lower parts of the rays on which 

 they rested accidentally pressed in so as to appear to support the ventral extension; or, 

 in other words, so as to give this part the appearance of being actually composed of the 

 arms themselves united laterally and crowned byavault? If this upward prolongation 

 of the boJy was really composed of the arms united laterally, and there were no free 

 arms, with the usual ambulacral openings at their bases, the whole visceral cavity would 

 seem to have been hermetically sealed, excepting perhap» the minute lateral pores we 

 have found to exist in the ventral extension of many analogous forms. Prof. de Koninck 



. distinctly states that he was unable to find any traces of an anal or buccal opening in nis 

 type, and we have been equally unable to find any traces of such openings in any of the 

 numerous specimens of Poteriocnnus, Scaphiocrinus, Zeacrinus, Cbslocrinus, and other analo- 



fous forms we have seen, that are provided with a similar large ventral extension of the 

 ody. But in ali these types there are well developed free arms, with ambidacral openings at their 

 bases. It will be remembered that the genus Haplocrinus was supposed to have its arms 

 united to form a kind of conical'vault, until Muller discovered a species with true free 

 arms independent of this part. 



If Hydreionocrinus really possessed free arms, it would otherwise agreeso exactly with 

 Zeacrinus that it would seem to be impossible to separate them even subgenerieaíly: in 

 which case Troosfs name would probably become a synonym under Hydreionocrinus, as 

 Prof. de Koninck's name was, we believe, published a "few months earlier than Dr. 

 Troost's. It is to be hoped that those who may have an opportunity to examine other 

 specimens than those studied by Prof. de Koninck, of the typical species of Hydreionocri- 

 »?>/.?.* will examine them very carefully to see if some remains of free arms cannot be 

 found. 



* Hydreionocrinus ? globularis. de Kon., seems to us to belong to a distinct genus nearly al- 

 lied to Agassizocrinus, which in some species hasits base distinctly divided into five parts.

Eupachycrinus Boydii, M. and W. 



Body much depressed, or twice and a half as wide as high to the top of the 

 first radiais, rounding inward above the second radiais, and under to the very 

 profound central concavity below; composed of thick, strong, slightly convex 

 plates. Base very small, and deeply sunken in the concavity of the under 

 side. Subradials comparatively large, convex and curving upward above, and 

 under below, and then again upward into the concavity of the under side, 

 where each of them has a raesial indentation or notch ; each presenting a 

 general pentagonal outlíne, excepting two on the anal side, which are modi- 

 fied for the reception of the anal pieces. First radial pieces about twice as 

 high, convex, and equaling the subradials in breadth ; ali pentagonal in form. 

 Second radial pieces convex, about half as large as the first, which they do not 

 quite equal in breadth, although they are in contact with each other laterally 

 ali around, thus giving a contracted appearance to the body just above the 

 first radiais ; each about twice as wide as high, pentagonal in form, and bear- 

 ing on one superior sloping side an arm, while on the other there rests a 

 smaller secondary radial bearing two arms ; thus making, as far as can be 

 seen, three arms to a ray, or if the same structure exists in ali the rays, fifteen 

 to the entire series. First, or subanal, rather large, nearly quadrangular in 

 form, and resting between the sloping upper sides of two of the subradials, 

 under one side of the first radial on the right, and connecting with the second 

 radial on the left ; but apparently noialways extending up far enough to have 

 its upper angle truncated by one of the succeeding anais above. Second anal 

 piece considerably smaller than the first, and resting upon the upper trun- 

 cated side of one of the subradials ; above these two or three smaller pieces 

 appear between the arms. Surface smooth. Sutures between the body-plates 

 rather deep. 



Arms slightly convex on the outer side, with lateral margins flattened and 

 straight, so as to fit closely together when raised up vertically ;* each composed 

 below of a single range of wedge-formed pieces, but soon passing into a double 

 alternating series above. 



Breadth of body across the middle, 0-90 inch ; do. across the second radiais, 

 0-64 inch ; height to top of first radial pieces, 0-40 inch. 



This is a very neat, symmetrical crinoid, unlike any other known to us, and 

 remarkable for having its much depressed body rounding in above, at the top 

 of its first radial pieces, so as to be very distinctly narrower across above the 

 top of the first radiais than below. Its sides also round very neatly under 

 below, and so far into the deep concavity of the under side that the lower 

 (inner) ends of the subradial pieces curve upward into the mesial concavity 

 nearly as far up as their outer or uppper ends. It seems to be the same form 

 figured by Prof. Yandell and Dr. Shumard, in their " Contributions to the 

 Geology of Kentucky," (see fig. 4 a, b), without a description or name, from 

 near Grayson Springs, Kentucky. The specific name is given in honor of Dr. 

 Boyd, of Chicago, to whom we are indebted for the use of the last specimen" 

 seen.

 to nearly twice as wide as high. Subradial pieces as long as the basais, or 

 sometimes a little longer, and always wider ; more or less convex, ali hexa- 

 gonal excepting one on the anal side, which is heptagonal. First radial

 rays seen,* as wide as the first, but much shorter, or only one-third to one-

 ing upon its superior slightly sloping sides, the first divisions of the arras, 

 which, at least in one of the posterior, and one of the lateral rays, bifurcate 

 on the third piece, while some of the divisions appear to divide again on the 

 f >urth piece. which is as far as they can be traced in the speciraens examined. 

 Column large, or nearly two-thirds as wide as the base, at its connection with 

 the latter ; but suddenly tapering downward, and, at least in one of the ex- 

 auiples, ending with the sixth piece in a rounded point, evidently showing 

 this individual to have been free at maturity. Connecting, or upper joint, of 

 the column in the only two examples seen, very thick, and in one quite tumid. 



Height to summit of first radial pieces, 0-48 inch ; breadth of do., 0-50 inch ; 

 height of base, 0-20 inch ; breadth of do., 0-24 inch ; breadth of rays below 

 the first division, 0-17 inch. 



This species seems to be most nearly related to H. polydactylus of Shumard, 

 from which it differs in the remarkable narrowness of its base, and the pro- 

 portional greater thickness of its column. It also differs in having only three 

 to four primary radiais to each ray, instead of five to six.

Genus GODONITES, M. and W. 



In the Proceedings for April of last year, page 84, we proposed, in a note, 

 to found a new genus under the above name, for the reception of Pentremites 

 stelliformis, of Owen and Shumard. This genus agrees with Pentremites in 

 structure, excepting that its openings corresponding to those usually called 

 the ovarian apertures (Hydrospires, of Mr. Billings), instead of forming with 

 the larger opening, usually called the anus, five round apertures, appear 

 at the surface as ten elongated slits, widest at the upper and inner ends, and 

 situated one on each side of each of the so-called pseudo-ambulacra.f Again 

 its aperture, corresponding to that usually considered the anus in Pentremites, 

 is proportionally larger, more remote from the center of radiation, and com- 

 pletely disconnected from the so-called ovarian opening on each side of it. 

 As in Pentremites, the central hiatus is covered by small plates in perfect speci- 

 mens, and from this little disc of plates two rows of minute alternating pieces 

 are seen to extend out, so as to cover each of the little ambulacral furrows, 

 passing along the middle of each pseudo-ambulacral área and under the cen- 

 tral disc, into the covered central aperture. These little covering plates of 

 the furrows probably extended the whole length of the pseudo-ambulacra, 

 but were doubtless movable, or capable of opening along the middle. being in 

 fact marginal ambulacral pieces. 



. As in the genus Pentremites, we also observe in this type three pieces an- 

 chylosed to the bottom of the busasal pieces, with the sutures between them 

 exactly coinciding with those separating the three busas pieces ; these we pro- 

 pose to call supplementary basal pieces. J The internai folds, or compressed 



* The right posterior ray seems to be an exception to this statement, as it appears to 

 have only three radiais including the first, with the second one nearly as large as the 

 flrst. Its parts, however, are not well preserved. 



f We regard these, as elsewhere stated, as really recumbent arms, similar to those of 

 some Cystoids. 



X Mr. S. S. Lyon was the first author, so far as we are informed, who called attention to 

 these lower pieces in Pentremites ; and he showed that they are really separable from the 

 basal pieces, in some cases (See Owen's Geol. Report of the Kentucky Survey, vol. 3, p. 

 468). He, however, regarded these pieces as the true base, and those usually so consid- 

 ered, as Mibradials. At one time we were inclined to adopt this view, as has been recently 

 done by Mr. Billings, in an interesting paper on the structure of the Blastoids and other 

 types, published in the American Journal of Sciences and Arts, for July, 18C9. The fact, 

 however, that theae lower pieces do not alternate with the range above, that Mr. Lyon's view

tubes of thiii calcareous inatter under the pseudo-ambulacra, and connecting 

 with the ianer ends of the slits representing the so-called ovarian pores, are 

 also constructed as in Pentr emites, excepting that here there are twelve of 

 these tubes under each pseudo-ambulacral área, while we have not seen more 

 than eight in any of the true Pentremites, nor more than four in Granatocrinus, 

 though we are not positively sure that these numbers will always be found 

 to hold good as generic distinctions. 



Compared with Codaster, the type under consideration is found to differ in 

 having only two of the slits mentioned in each of the anal and interradial 

 áreas, instead of about eight to sixteen ; while it has these slits equally in the 

 anal and interradial áreas, instead of only in the latter, as in Codaster. It 

 also differs from that genus in having the internai folds or compressed tubers, 

 under the so-called pseudo-ambulacra, instead of extending under the whole 

 interradial áreas. 



Since proposing this new genus, we have received from Mr. Wachsmuth a 

 fine specimen of another species of this type, which, although widely different 

 specifically, from the typical species, still exhibits very clearly the same gen- 

 eric characters, as will be seen from the following specific description : 



Codonites gracilis, D. and W. 



Body comparatively small, pentagonal-suboval, longer than wide, the widest 

 part being at the lower extremities of the so-called pseudo-ambulacral fields, 

 which terminate a little' below the middle. Supplementary base small, very 

 short, or only appearing to be composed of a single tripartite joint of the col- 

 umn. Base low, or near three times as wide as high, expanding rapidiy up- 

 ward, and pentagonal in outline, as seen from below ; basal pieces of mode- 

 rate size, two pentagonal and one hexagonal. Radial pieces nearly twice as 

 long as wide, with a general oblong outline, though they are a little wider in 

 the middle than above or below ; while the superior lateral angies are a little 

 truncated by the anal and interradial pieces, and the lower end is rounded, or 

 somewhat obtusely augular in outline at the middle ; ali rather distinctly 

 convex below the middle ; so called pseudo-ambulacral sinuses narrow, and 

 very slightly tapering, — extending down a little below the middle, where they 

 each terminate at a little poiuted projection, which is directed horizontally 

 outward, so as to add to the pentagonal form of the body, as seen from above 

 or below. Anal piece of moderate size, wider and more obtuse below than 

 the interradials, and narrowed above, with a comparatively large anal opening, 

 nearly dividing it a little below the middle, where it is very contracted.* In- 



would require should be considered subradials, would alone be an objection to this con- 

 clusion. It is also worthy of note, that when these lower pieces are removed, we find the 

 next range of pieces above closed together, so as to form the bottom of the visceral 

 cavity, as true basais. Again in those species of Granalocrinus, like G. Norwoodii, with a 

 deep*concavity in the under side, we find the pieces corresponding to those Mr. Lyon 

 thinks are the subradials, as it were, pushed inward, and forming a little pyramid in the 

 bottom of the visceral cavity, precisely as we see the true basais in various types of 

 Crinoids with a sunken base. In addition to this, although adult specimens of the type 

 here under consideration have this lower part, supposed by Mr. L. to be the true base, 

 as solid as in the true Pentremites, young individuais show that it is actually composed of 

 five or six of the upper joinls of the celumn enlarged and anchylosed together. Similar enlarge- 

 ments of the upper joints of the columns of various types of Crinoids are known to occur, 

 as, for instance, in Forbesiocrinus and its allies, in Poteriocrinites, Apiocrinitts, etc. It is 

 true, that in these the enlarged part is not divided longitudinally by sutures, as in Pen- 

 tremites, Codonites, etc. This fact, however, will be seen to be of less importancc when it 

 is remembered that there are examples of true Crinoids with the column longitudinally 

 divided; such, for instance, as in Barycrinus, where we see the whole column divided into 

 five sections longitudinally, through its whole length. And here the five sutures of the 

 column coincide with those between the five true basal pieces, exactly as the three sutures 

 between the supplementary basal pieces in Codonites and Pentremites coincide with those 

 between their three basal pieces. 



* We have several times thought we could see indications of sutures dividing the anal 

 piece of Codonites stellifoi-mis and Granatocrinus Nonoocdii into three pieces. That is, a 

 transverse suture at the anal opening, and a longitudinal one dividing the upper or inner 

 half into two pieces. Some casts of the interior of G. Norwoodii seem to show this dis- 

 tinctly.

terradials more than twice as long as wide, the widest part being below, while 

 the central region is much contracted, and the upper part, like that of the 

 anal piece, somewhat dart-shaped, and a little concave, with a smaller tuber- 

 cle occupying the middle of the little concavity. 



So-called pseudo-ambulacral fields rather narrow, somewhat convex, with 

 mesial or ambnlacral furrows rather wide and deep, particularl}- above the 

 middle; pore or arm-pieces, about twenty-two on each side of each área ; lan- 

 cet pieces very narrow, but thick, and rather deeply furrowed along the mid- 

 dle above, where they form the bottom of the ambulacral furrows ; farther 

 down, tbe pore pieces close in so as nearly or quite to cover the lancet pieces 

 at the lower end. Elongated slits corresponding to the openings usually 

 called ovarian apertures in Pentremiles, widest at the upper end, and extending 

 down apparently three-fourths of the length of the pseudo-ambulacral áreas, 

 so very close to the margins of the latter as scarcely to leave more than a 

 thin intervening space above, and apparently none below. Central hiatus 

 very small, and doubtless covered by minute plates in perfect specimens. 



Surface distinctly ornamented with very regular, well-deíined striae, run- 

 ning parallel to the upper margins of the basal pieces, and to the inferior and 

 lateral margins of the radiais. Along the margins of the pseudo-ambulacral 

 áreas, narrow flattened, or very slightly concave spaces are seen extending 

 along the surface of the radial pieces, and corresponding to the rather broad, 

 deep furrows seen occupying the same position in the typical species, O. 

 stelliformis. (Column and pinnulae unknown.) 



Height, 0*60 inch ; breadth, about 0-50 inch. 



This species, although agreeing with C. stelliformis in the important charac- 

 ters distinguishing this genus from PentremÀtes and Codaster, differs so materi- 

 ally in form and other specific characters, as to render a comparison unneces- 

 sary. In general form it much more nearly resembles the true Pentremiles 

 than the typical form of Codonites does. It must be very rare, as we are not 

 aware that more than the one specimen has ever been found. 



Locality and position. Lower division of the Burlington group of the Lower 

 Carboniferous, at Burlington, Iowa. Mr. Wachsmuth's collection. 



Body attaining a médium size, ovoid, or ovoid-subglobose, depressed and 

 sbort below, and rounded and more produced above. Supplementary base 

 very small, or only one-fourth as wide as the base, rounded aud íirmly anchy- 

 losed to the true base ; short, or apparently composed of not more than three 

 anchylosed segments from the upper end of the column. Base of moderate 

 size, much depressed, or having the form of a pentagonal dish. Radial pieces 

 once and a half as long as wide; rather narrow below, and widening upward 

 to near the middle, above which they are very slightly contracted to the top ; 

 each divided three-fourths of its length by its rather wide pseudo-ambulacral 

 sinus. Anal and interradial pieces very small, exposed part presenting an 

 elongate rhombic outline, the upper part being more elongate and acute than 

 the lower. So-called pseudo-ambulacral áreas* wide, moderately convex, 

 tapering rather gradually below the middle, and more abruptly above ; so- 

 called pore pieces about 35 on each side of each área, less than half as long, 

 transversely, as the breadth of the exposed part of the lancet pieces at their 

 widest part, nearly transverse above, but becoming somewhat oblique toward the 

 lower part of the área ; supplementary pore pieces small. Lancet pieces ex- 

 posing a wide, lanceolate form, being widest above the middle, gradually ta- 

 pering below, and contracting abruptly above; each with its mesial or ambu- 

 lacral furrow rather wide and deep, and minutely crenate within ; transverse 



* Although we use here the usual term for these parts, we really regard them as recum- 

 bent arms, similar to those seen in some Cysloidea.

furrows well defined, and also minutely crenate. Central hiatus small. So- 

 called ovarian openings small, and those distinct from the anal opening ap- 

 pearing at the surface as four pairs of closely approximated elongate-oval 

 pores. Anal opening comparatively large, and, as usual in the genus, inclu- 

 ding one of the pores on each side. Surface ornamented with five parallel 

 striae, running as usual in allied species. 



Height of one of the smaller, less globose specimens, exclusive of the little 

 supplementary base, 0-50 inch ; breadth, 0-49 inch. Height of a large, more 

 ventricose specimen, 0-87 inch ; breadth of do«, 0-84 inch. 



This species has much the form and general appearance of the common P. 

 Godoni, — so mueh so, indeed, that those who give wide limits to species 

 would probably fail to observe any well defined differences. On comparison, 

 it will be found to differ, however, in the following characters, viz. : In the 

 first place, its pseudo-ambulacral áreas are more convex, and not bounded by 

 near such sbarply elevated margins of the radial pieces. Its pore pieces are 

 also larger, and scarcely more than half as numerous as in P, Godoni. Its 

 anal and interradial pieces arelikewise decidedly smaller than in that species, 

 while it also presents the well-marked difference of having its so-called 

 ovarian openings with each pair appearing at the surface, as two closely ap- 

 proximated, but distinct elongate-oval pores, instead of as a single round, 

 larger opening. It moreover holds a much lower geological position than P. 

 Godoni. 



It is the first true, typical Pentr emite we have seen with each pair of ovarian 

 pores (so-called) appearing as two distinct pores at the surface. It must be 

 quite rare, as only three specimens have come under our observation. 



Locality and position. Upper division of the Burlington group of the Lower 

 Carboniferous, at Burlington, Iowa. No. 387 of Mr. Wachsmuth's collection. 



Oligoporus Coreyi, M. and W. 



Body small, subglobose, or apparently depressed-globose, and deeply sul- 

 cate ; composed of moderately thick plates ; apical region sunken. Inter- 

 ambulacral áreas twice as wide as the ambulacral, very convex, and rounded 

 over from side to side ; composed at the middle by six ranges of plates, which 

 decrease in numbers to apparently about tbree ranges, at the upper and lower 

 extremities of the áreas. Ambulacral áreas deeply furrowed along each side, 

 and rising into a rather prominent ridge along the middle; composed of 

 somewhat irregular plates, as to size and form, but clearly showing but two 

 rows on each side of the mesial zig-zag suture, the outer range being gener- 

 ally a little shorter in the transverse diameter than the inner ; the two pores 

 of each piece situated near its outer end. Apical disc unknown. Oral aper- 

 ture, as seen in the test, comparatively large. Surface unknown. 



Height, as near as can be determined fiom a somewhat distorted specimen, 

 about 1-65 inches ; breadth near 2 inches. 



This species is most nearly allied to O. Dance, but differs not only in being 

 much smaller, and apparently more depressed in form, but in having much 

 more deeply furrowed ambulacral áreas, and only six rows of interambulacral 

 pieces at the widest part of the áreas, instead of eight, the plates being also 

 larger in proportion to the size of the body. 



From our O. nobilis it will also be readily distinguished by its much smaller 

 size, and more deeply sulcate ambulacral áreas, which are also proportionally 

 much wider. It also diífers in having six rows of interambulacral pieces at 

 the widest part of each área, instead of only five. 



Locality and position. Crawfordsville, Indiana; from the Keokuk division 

 of the Lower Carboniferous series. The specimen from which the description 

 was made out belongs to Mr. Corey, of Crawfordsville, Ind.. to whom we have 

 dedicated the species.

BRACHIOPODA. 



Chonetes?? millepunctata, M. and W. 



Shell attaining a large size, very thin, transversely subseraicircular, or 

 more than twice as wide as long, with lateral extremities rounded. Dorsal 

 valve nearly flat, or but slightly and evenly concave ; hinge line a, little less 

 than the greatest transverse diameter; cardioal process rather stont, 

 with an obscure linear ridge (or sulcus) extending forward from its base 

 nearly to the front; cardinal edge slightly thickened within, so as to 

 form a faintly defined ridge extending about half-way from the cardi- 

 nal process toward each lateral margin, but apparently without any trace of 

 sockets for the reception of teeth in the other valve ; muscular and other in- 

 ternai markings unknown ; surface ornamented by numerous slender.exceed- 

 ingly regular, closely arranged concentric lines, exactly parallel with each 

 other and the front and lateral margins. (Ventral valve unknown.) 



Length of a médium sized specimen, 1-30 inch ; breadth, 2-95 inches» 

 Largest examples seen, 2-10 inches in length, and of nearly the same propor- 

 tional breadth as the others. 



Of this very remarkable shell we have seen six or eight specimens, and 

 some fragments of others. Ali of the specimens yet found, however, are dor- 

 sal valves only, the ventral valve being entirely unknown to us. The slightly 

 worn, or more or less weathered conditiou of the specimens has obliterated 

 whatever muscular or other internai markings there may have been. In most 

 cases only patches of the shell itself remain, though, even in these cases, the 

 general outline and externai surface markings are very distinctly defined in 

 the matrix. Ali of the specimens show a rather obscure, linear, internai sul- 

 cus extending from the base of the cardinal process nearly to the anterior 

 margin. This, however, is probably caused by the accidental removal of a 

 linear mesial ridge, because we also see it equally defined in impres.^ions of 

 the externai surface of the valve left in the matrix, just as would be the case 

 if a firni internai ridge had been, owing to the thinness of the shell, as it were, 

 pressed through. The concentric lines of the surface present an extraordinary 

 degree of regularity, both in size and arrangement. Òn a médium sized dor- 

 sal valve about sixty of these lines may be counted, while some of the largest 

 show twice as many. They are of exactly the same size and distauce apart 

 on ali the specimens, and of so nearly the same size on ali parts of the same 

 individual as to appear to the eye to be exactly uniform throughout. By 

 measurement, however, we count fifteen of them in the space of 0-25 inch 

 near the margins of a médium sized specimen, and twenty in the same space 

 near the beak. In a few instances we have observed what seemed to be the 

 faintest possible traces of a few larger radiating lines or costa?, near the mid- 

 dle of the anterior margin of the dorsal valve. None of the specimens show 

 the cardinal process entire, but as far as its characters can be made out it 

 seems to have been much as in Chonetes. 



The most remarkable character of this shell, however, remains to be raen- 

 tioned. That is, its extremely coarse punctate structure, and the unusually 

 close arrangement of the punctures, which are so large as to be nearly visible 

 to the unassisted eye. As seen by the aid of a coramon single pocket lens, 

 they present, on the inner surface of the dorsal valve, much the appearance 

 and arrangement of the cells of a delicate Chietetes, the spaces between them 

 being much less than the diameter of the pores themselves. They appear to 

 diminish rapidly in size, however, as they approach the externai surface, near 

 which they seem to be a little less than the diameter of the spaces by which 

 they are separated. As we have never seen such a shell structure as this in 

 any species known to possess the characters of the genus Chonetes, nor indeed 

 in any other known Brachiopod, we are very strongly inclined to believe our 

 shell really belongs to an undescribed genus. The fact that there appear to 

 be no sockets in the cardinal margins of its dorsal valve, for the reception o!

36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



teeth in the other valve, would also favor the conclusion that it is not a true 

 Chonetes. Nevertheless, we prefer to place it provisionally in that genus, un- 

 til specimens can be obtained showing the dorsal valve, with the muscular 

 impressions and other generic characters. Should it be found, as we believe 

 it will, to be a new generic type, we would suggest for it the name Isogramma 

 (ío-eç, equal; yp*/u/uy, a line), in allusion to the remarkable equality of thecon- 

 centric lines of the surface. 



To whatever genus our shell may really belong, it is evidently very closely 

 allied, even specifically, to a forni figured by Mr. Davidson from the Carbon- 

 iíerous limestone of Scotland, in his valuable Monograph of the British Car- 

 boniferous Brachiopoda, vol. ii, part v, pi. lv, fig. 13. Mr. Davidson referred 

 his shell, with much doubt, on the authority of Dr. De Koninck, to Chonetes 

 concêntrica, of the latter author. We fully concur with Mr. Davidson, how- 

 ever, in the opinion that it is distinct from Prof. De Koninck's* species, as it 

 is much longer, and instead of being marked with only 12 to 13 large concen- 

 tric ridges, has about 37 regular, more concentric lines. In our species there 

 are about twice the number of lines seen on that figured by Mr. Davidson, in 

 specimens of the same size ; and as this character is remarkably uniform in 

 ali our specimens, we cannot believe it otherwise than a specific difference. 



Locality and position. Upper Coal Measures, Marion County, Illinois, where 

 it occurs associated with nearly ali the fossils in the Upper Coal Measures of 

 Kansas and Iowa, and in those in Nebraska referred by Profs. Marcou and 

 Geinitz to the Perrnian. 



Spirifer fastigatus, M. and W. 



Shell attaining a rather large size, moderately convex, very transverse, or 

 distinctly more than twice as wide as long ; greatest breadth on the hinge 

 line ; lateral extremities very attenuate and acutely pointed in young speci- 

 mens, but becoming more obtuse in larger individuais ; front and anterior 

 lateral margins broadly and rather regularly rounded. Dorsal valve nearly 

 as convex as the ventral ; beak depressed, somewhat incurved, and scarcely 

 projecting beyond the hinge line; área of rather more than usual breadth for 

 that of a dorsal valve, and arched with the beak ; mesial fold commencing at 

 the beak scarcely larger than one of the ribs on each side of it, but increasing 

 gradually in breadth and prominence to the front, where it is occupied by 

 about six to eight costíe, which, however, coalesce into one or two at the 

 beak. Ventral valve regularly convex over the central region, and somewhat 

 compressed toward the lateral extremities ; mesial sinus commencing narrow 

 and very small near the beak, and widening and deepening gradually to the 

 front, where it is occupied by about eight depressed, rounded costse, which, 

 like those on the fold of the other valve, coalesee with those on each side 

 and with each other, so as to leave but one that extends quite to the beak ; 

 beak rather depressed and not projecting much beyond the hinge line, arched 

 or moderately incurved ; área rather narrow, and extending with almost per- 

 fectly parallel margins, quite out to the lateral extremities of the hinge, marked 

 by the usual transverse and vertical striae ; foramen wider than high, rather 

 large, and extending close up under the rather flattened apex of the beak. 



Surface ornamented by depressed, rounded, bifurcating or trifid, more or 

 less fasciculated costae, about five of which, on each side of the mesial sinus and 

 fold, are larger than the others, and divide before reaching the front, so as to 

 form as many fasciculi of two or three ribs each, the furrows between which 

 are less strongly defined than those between the bundles. Toward the lateral 

 extremities some eight or ten smaller, simple, obscure costae, that do not 

 reach the beaks, may also be counted, on each side of each valve, gradually 

 becoming obsolete near the ends. Crossing the whole, fine obscure, undulat-

ing striíe, and a few stronger marks of growth may be observed on well pre- 

 served specimens, the striae, however, excepting near the froat and lateral 

 margins, not being readily seen without the aid of a magnifier. 



Length, about 1-45 incbes ; breadth, 2-20 inches; convexity, about 1*50 

 inches ; height of área at the beak, 0-26 inch. 



We have had specimens of this fine Spirifer under consideration for a long 

 time, and after numerous careful comparisons, we have been unable to iden- 

 tify it with any of the described species. It seems to be most nearly allied to 

 ourcommon Coal-Measure species S. cameratus, of Morton, with which it agrees 

 in the fasciculated cbaracter of its costae, and in general appearance. It dif- 

 fers, however, in several characters by which it can be readily distinguished 

 on comparison. In the first place, its larger fasciculated costae are distinctly 

 broader, and rather more depressed on the anterior slope of its valves, and 

 proportionally less numerous. The incurved apex of the beak of its ventral 

 valves is always less abruptly curved, and much more flattened. The most 

 marked character, however, is to be observed in its cardinal área, which has 

 its margins almost perfectly parallel, instead of being always sloping from the 

 beak to the lateral extremities. The same characters and its narrow mesial 

 fold and sinus distinguish it from the variety of S. striatus, with somewhat 

 fasciculated costae. It belongs to the subgenus Trigonotreta. 



Locality and position. Keokuk division of the Lower Carboniferous series, 

 at Crawfordsville, Indiana. 



Stricklandinia deformis, M. and W. 



Shell (internai casts) longitudinally subovate, oblong, or sometimes in 

 young examples nearly or quite as wide as long; valves very nearly equal, 

 and sometimes showing very faint traces of an obscure mesial prominence on 

 the dorsal valve, and of a corresponding depression near the front of the ven- 

 tral valve ; hinge line straight, and less than the breadth of the. valves ; sur- 

 face apparently smooth, or only with concentric lines on the young shell, 

 while casts of the adult show some traces of a few obscure, irregular, radiat- 

 ing ridges. Beaks, área and finer surface markings unknown. 



Length of a young internai cast, 1 inch ; breadth, 0-97 inch ; convexity, 0-46 

 inch. Length of a large specimen, 1-93 inches; breadth, 1-58 inches ; con- 

 vexity, 1 inch. 



This shell varied so greatly in form at different stages of its growth that it 

 is very difficult to give a description that will convey a correct idea of it. 

 Young examples from 0-70 to one inch in length approach a broad obovate 

 form, being truncated on the hinge line, and somewhat narrowly rounded 

 at the middle of the front ; while their posterior lateral margins are more or 

 less straightened and inflected, as we often seen in Rensselaeria. After attain- 

 ing this size and form, the shell, judging from some four adult examples we 

 have seen, seems to have suddenly commenced a more vigorous growth, 

 mainly forward and antero-laterally, so as to attain a much larger size, leav- 

 ing the valves of the young shell, as it were, opened and spread upon the 

 beaks, thus completely destroying the symmetry of the entire shell. At this 

 stage of growth the shell has a curious constricted appearance at the con- 

 nection of the young and adult shell ; while the whole breadth posteriorly 

 is only that of the young shell, and the widest part is then some distance in 

 advance of this, and the posterior margins are strongly flattened by their 

 sudden inflection towards each other there. 



The casts show that the chamber in the beak of the ventral valve is of 

 moderate size, and supported upon a rather short mesial septum. The socket 

 processes are seen, by their impressions in the cast, to be small, not united, 

 and scarcely assuming the character of plates ; while the crural processes ex- 

 tended from their inner lower sides forward nearly parallel, so as to leave two 

 slender, deep perforations in the cast. The surface of the young shell appears.

to have bcen smooth, or only marked with the concentric striae, but internai 

 casts of large individuais sometiines show very faint traces of a few broad ir- 

 regular, radiating, flattened ridges. 



It is probable that this species is most nearly allied to Slricklandinia David- 

 soni, of Billings (Geol. Mag. vol. v, pi. iv, fig. 1, 1 a), which, in some stages 

 of its growth, it resembled rather nearly in form. In ali the large examples. 

 however, it differs extremely from that shell, in its remarkable narrowness 

 across the umbones, and its truncated or flattened posterior lateral margins. 

 Its front is also less produced and less narrowly rounded in the middle in 

 these larger specimens. 



Locality and position. Ali the specimens of this species we have seen were 

 found loose in Carroll County, Illinois, near rocks of the age of the Niagara 

 group. They are ali in the condition of white quartz casts of the interior. 



LAMELLIBRANCHIATA. 



MONOTIS ? GREGÁRIA. 



Shell very small, extremely thin, compressed, oblique, varying from trun- 

 cato-suboval to subcircular ; hinge line less than the breadth of the valves ; 

 auricles small, obtusely angular, undefined by any sinuosity of the margins ; 

 posterior (?) margin rather regularly rounded in outline, and rounding into 

 the pallial margin ; anter, (?) border prominent below and rounding into the 

 base, but straight and ascending with a backward slant to the hinge ; beaks 

 located near the middle of the hinge line, above which they seem scarcely to 

 rise. Surface marked by extremely fine concentric striae, and a few some- 

 what larger furrows or wrinkles of growth, crossed on the anterior (?) half 

 of each valve by small radiating costae, generally not defined near the an- 

 terior (?) margin. 



Antero-posterior diameter, 0-25 inch ; height, or diameter at right angles 

 to the hinge, 0-20 inch ; convexity unknown. 



Of this little shell we have numerous specimens, ali compressed to entire 

 flatness on the surfaces of the laminas of shale, many of them lying with the 

 two valves opened out and connected by their hinge margins. As thus seen, 

 their small size causes them to appear much like the valves of Posidonomia, 

 or those of some of the little phyllopod Crustácea. This form, however, is 

 found, on closer examination, to be different, while their radiating costas also 

 indicate different affinities. Some individuais are a little wider proportionally, 

 in their antero-posterior diameter, than that from which the above measure- 

 ments were taken, and these have much the outline of the left valve of some 

 forms of Aviculopecten, excepting that the auricles are not in the slightest de- 

 gree defined (in either valve) by any traces of a marginal sinus. 



It is possible that this little shell may be a true Lima, as it has much the 

 form of some species of that genus, and there certainly are in the Western 

 Coal-measures, two or more species apparently agreeing in ali respects with 

 that genus. If a Lima, of course the side we have described as the anterior 

 must be the posterior, and vice versa. The reasons for doubting its relations 

 to the genus Lima, however, are, (1), its extreme thinness ; (2), the fact that 

 it seems to have a prismatic structure ; and (3), its very small size. It is 

 possible, however, that the extremely thin fibrous shell, as we now see, 

 may consist only of the externai lamina, left after the decomposition of the 

 inner layers. If so, and the fibrous appearance is really the original struc- 

 ture, it would more probably belong to some perhaps undescribed genus, 

 allied to Aviculopecten, of the family Aviculidce. If a true Monotis, it would 

 be the only known species of that genus in our Carboniferous rocks, the 

 common Western Coal-measure shells usually referred to that genus, belong- 

 ing to a very distinct group, to which Beyrich has applied the name Pseudo- 

 monotis.

AVICULOPECTEN SPINULIFERUS, M. aild W. 



Shell of médium size, rather compressed, having a moderately oblique, 

 truncato-suboval, or suborbicular outline. Hinge apparently nearly equal- 

 ing the antero-posterior diameter of the shell ; ventral margin forming a 

 broad seniiovate outline, being more abruptly rounded up behind than in 

 front. Posterior wing rather pointed, apparently not quite as long as the 

 rounded margin of the valves below, from which it is separated by a rounded 

 sinus. Anterior wing compressed, narrow, as long as the anterior margin of 

 the valves ; in the left valve pointed, and separated from the margin below by 

 a narrowly rounded, rather deep sinus. Beak of the left valve moderately 

 prominent, and placed a little in advance of the middle. Surface of same 

 valve ornamented with numerous, distinct, unequal, radiating costae, arranged 

 usually with one or two smaller ones between each two of a somewhat larger 

 series, the latter of which bear numerous little round, regularly arranged, 

 somewhat oblique spines ; crossing the whole there are also numerous minute 

 concentric striae. (Right valve unknown.) 



Height of left valve, about 1-50 inch ; antero-posterior diameter, near 2 

 inches. 



This is a delicate species, apparently with thin valves. Its costae seem to 

 be nearly equally developed over the whole of the left valve, iucluding the 

 wings, or at any rate the posterior one. On the body of this valve, near the 

 ventral margin, about five of the larger spiniferous costas, and some six 

 or eight of the smaller non-spiniferous ones may be counted in the space 

 of half an inch. The spines of the larger costae were short, round and 

 pointed (not being formed by vaulted laminae of growth), and arranged 

 along these costae at regular intervals of about 0-10 inch apart, those at the 

 ventral margin being larger than the others, and projecting a little below the 

 border. An impression of a part of the anterior wing of the right valve shows 

 that it was distinctly costate, two or three of the costae running nearly paral- 

 lel to the hinge margin, and bearing short spinules. 



In casts of this species without the spines, the costae present much the same 

 subnodose appearance as those seen on A. fallax {= Pecten fallax, McCoy, 

 Carb. Foss. Ireland, pi. 14, fig. 2), but that species seems to have had no 

 spines. It is also much less oblique, and higher in proportion to its antero- 

 posterior diameter. 



We place this species in the genus Aviculopecten only provisionally, as we 

 have not seen its hinge. It is highly probable that there areanumber of un- 

 described genera among the Palaeozoic species usually included in the genus 

 Aviculopecten, or wrongly referred by some to the genus Pecten. 



Locality and position. Crawfordsville, Indiana. Keokuk division of the 

 Lower Carboniferous series. 



Genus CARBONARCA, Meek and Worthen. 



Shell (as determined from internai casts) equivalve, inequilateral, very 

 convex, transversely oblong or oval ; umbones gibbous, prominent, and 

 strongly iucurved with subangular or prominent posterior slopes ; valves 

 closed ali around, with smooth margins; ligament externai; cardinal margin 

 a little arched, with, at the anterior extremity in each valve, two rather ob- 

 lique, comparatively stout teeth, and extending along its entire length from 

 immediately behind these, a row of minute interlocking teeth or crenulations, 

 as in Arca. 



This genus seems to belong to the Arcidse, near Isoarca. It differs, how- 

 ever, very decidedly from that genus, in having, in addition to the small in- 

 terlocking crenulations along the whole length of the hinge, two well devel- 

 oped and independent larger teeth at the anterior end of the hinge. The 

 specimens seen are ali internai casts, but an impression of the hinge of a 

 right valve, in the matrix, shows its characters very clearly. There is no

gradation from the series of minute teeth into the two large ones at the ante- 

 rior end of the hinge, the first of the smaller series immediately behind the 

 two larger ones being as minute as any of thosefarther back, so that the eon- 

 trast between the two sets of teeth is well marked and abrupt. The hinge 

 margin was doubtless provided with a cardinal área, but as we only have in- 

 ternai cast, it has not yet been seen. 



Carbonarca gibbosa, M. and W. 



Shell transverse, short-oblong, very convex; posterior side wider than the 

 other, and vtrtically subtruncated ; anterior margin rather narrowly rounded ; 

 ventral margin nearly straight along the middle, but sloping and rounding up 

 anteriorly, and more abruptly behind, cardinal edge equaling two thirds of 

 the whole length ; larger anterior teeth inclined forward and upward, and 

 those of the small series ranging nearly vertically, or slightly inclined forward 

 anteriorly, and a little backward behind; umbones gibbous, but with their 

 outer and upper surfaces a little flattened, so as to impart a slightly suban- 

 gular or prominent character to the post-umbonal slopes ; immediate ápices 

 of the strongly incurved beaks placed about one-fourth the entire length of 

 the shell behind the anterior extremity. Surface markings unknown. 



Length, 0-82 inch ; height to top of cardinal margin (of cast) behind the 

 beaks, 0-56 inch ; do. to top of umbones, 0-65 ; convexity of the two valves, 

 0-57 inch. 



Locality and position. Springfield, Illinois ; Upper Coal measures. Also 

 same horizon at Lasalle, 111. The specimens from the latter locality are, in 

 some examples, more depressed and oblique than the typical form from near 

 Springfield, and these may possibly belong to a distinct species, if the differ- 

 ences noted are not due to accidental distortion. If really distinct, this form 

 might be called C. depressa. 



* Macrodon delicatcs, M. and W. 



Shell small, about twice and a half as long as high, moderately convex, 

 elongate rhomboidal in outline ; posterior margin obliquely truncated, so as 

 to be angular at the base ; cardinal margin about three-fourths the entire 

 length, and nearly parallel with the base ; anterior extremity very narrowly 

 rounded ; basal margin nearly straight along the middle, but rounding very 

 gradually upward anteriorly ; beaks depressed, and placed about one-fourth 

 the entire length of the valves behind the anterior extremity; posterior um- 

 bonal slopes subangular from the beaks obliquely backward and downward, 

 to the sharply rounded or subangular posterior basal extremity, while the 

 gpaces behind and above these slopes are compressed or slightly concave. 

 Surface marked by small ridges and lines of growth, which are crossed by 

 raised radiating lines or linear costa?, rather widely separated posteriorly, but 

 more closely arranged, and less strongly defined toward the front part of the 

 valves. (Cardinal área, hinge and muscular impressions unknown.) 



Length, 0-45 inch ; height, 0-19 inch ; convexity, about 0-1 1 inch. 



This little shell will be readily distinguished from its associate, formerly de- 

 scribed by us under the name M. tenuistriatus, by its much more oblique and less 

 gibbous form ; but more especially by having its linear radiating costae sepa- 

 rated by wide intervening spaces, instead of being closely crowded together. 

 Indeed, we know of no species with which it could be confounded. 



Locality and position. Springfield, Illinois. Upper Coal Measures. 



* In the Proceedings of the Chicago Academy of Sciences for March, 1866, p. 17, we 

 suggested that in case the name Macrodon, Lycett, could not be retained for this genus, 

 because it had been previously used by Muller for a genus of fishes, that it might be 

 called Parattelodon. In that case the name of this species would have to be written Paral- 

 lelodon delicatus.

Modiolopsis subnasuta, M. and W. 



Shell rather small, elongate, narrow and slightly arcuate, rather distinctly 

 convex, the most gibbous part being along the posterior umbonal slopes, 

 above the middle ; dorsal and ventral margins slightly diverging posteriorly, 

 so as to make the widest (highest) part of the valves nearest the posterior end, 

 while the most sinuous part of the ventral margin is a little in advance of the 

 middle ; anterior end narrow, a little produced, with an oblique forward 

 slope of its upper margin, to its narrowly rounded extremity ; posterior mar- 

 gin somewhat cuneate, with an oblique truncation more or less convex in 

 outline, to the posterior basal extremity, which is narrowly rounded ; cardi- 

 nal margin long and a little arched ; beaks much depressed, and placed rather 

 nearer the anterior edge than to the middle ; posterior umbonal slopes promi- 

 nent, and forming an obtuse ridge, which extends obliquely backward to the 

 posterior basal edge of each valve ; anterior muscular scar comparatively 

 large, round, shallow, and placed near the edge of the valves ; small pedal 

 muscular scars distinct just above those of the anterior adductors ; surface of 

 internai cast showing moderately distinct, irregular, concentric undulations, 

 which are most strongly defined below, and in front of the posterior umbonal 

 slopes, on the fiattened or concave flanks. 



Length, 1-31 inch ; height, 0-50 inch ; convexity, 0-40 inch. 



This is a neat, symmetrical shell, resembling M. nasuta, Conrad (sp.), but 

 differs in having the narrowed anterior end less produced, the beaks being 

 placed farther forward ; while its posterior end is broader, and obliquely 

 truncated, instead of being rounded. Its general outline is more like that of 

 Orthonota contracta, Hall (Palasont. N. Y., vol. i, pi. 32, fig. 8), though its lower 

 margin is less distinctly sinuous, its beaks more depressed, and its posterior 

 margin more oblique ; while it wants the oblique dorsal wrinkles seen on 

 casts of that shell, being a true Modiolopsis. 



Compared with foreign species, our shell is found to be very closely allied 

 to an English Upper Silurian species described by Mr. Salter under the name 

 M. platyphylla. Our shell, however, has the anterior end narrower and more 

 produced, with more prominent posterior umbonal ridges. 



Localily and position. Galena Limestone of the Lower Silurian, in Carroll 

 County, Illinois. 



SCHIZODUS AMPLUS. 



Shell attaining a large size, as determined from internai casts, moderately 

 convex, oblong-suboval in outline, or about one-fourth of its length longer 

 than high ; anterior side short, rounding from above the middle into the base ; 

 outline of ventral margin forming a broad semi-ovate curve ; posterior margin 

 nearly vertically subtruncated, but rounding abruptly into the dorsal margin 

 above and into the base below ; cardinal border nearly straight, and síoping 

 very slightly from the beaks posteriorly ; beaks much depressed, nearly ante- 

 rior, incurved, closely approximated, and directed forward and inward. Pos- 

 terior adductor muscular scar shallow, rather large, suboval, and located close 

 up under the posterior extremity of the hinge ; anterior do., smaller, deeper, 

 subovate, and placed very near the anterior margin a little above the middle, 

 with rather distinct, nearly detached, pedal muscular scars at their upper 

 ends. Posterior umbonal slopes with each a distinct sulcus extending from 

 the beaks obliquely backward and downward, becoming wider and more 

 shallow as they descend, so as to die out before reaching the posterior basal 

 margin. (Externai surface unknown.) ' 



Length of cast, 2-60 inches; height of do., 2-15 inches; convexity, 1-56 

 inches. 



This is the largest species of Schizodus (if it belongs to that genus) we have 

 yet seen. Our only specimen is an internai cast, giving no idea of the nature 

 of the hinge. From its general appearance, however, and the nature of its 



1870.] 




42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



muscular and simple pallial scars, together with the remains of its externai 

 ligament, we can have little doubt in regard to its being a Schizodus. In size 

 and general outline, its internai cast closely resembles Amphiccelia Leidyi, de- 

 scribed by Prof. Hall from the Upper Silurian Limestone at Bridgeport, near 

 Chicago. It has, however, obviously no near relations to that shell. For a 

 Schizodus, its beaks are unusually depressed and oblique. We know of no 

 other species resembling it in general form. 



Compared with Schizodus occidentalis (= Cypricardia ? occidentalis, Swallow), 

 which seeuis to be a true Schizodus, and agrees with our shell in size, it is at 

 once distinguished by its much more depressed beaks, less convex valves, and 

 broadly round posterior outline. Prof. Swallow ! s species also occurs in our 

 Coal Measures, but we have yet only seen it from a higher part of the series, 

 at Lasalle. 



Locality and position. Seaville, Fulton County, Illinois, Coal No. 1, of Coal 

 Measures. 



Schizodus (Prisconaia) perelegans, M. and W. 



Shell attaining a moderately large size, ovate-subcordate in general form, 

 very gibbous, apparently closed ali around, rather thin. Anterior and poste- 

 rior views presenting a neat cordate outline. Pallial margin semiovate, the 

 most prominent part being in front of the middle; anterior side very short, 

 and rounding up abruptly from below ; posterior side narrowly rounded, or 

 subangular ; hinge line apparently rather short. Beaks very gibbous, promi- 

 nent, pointed, and strongly incurved, so as to bring their points nearly or quite 

 in contact; located near the anterior margin; lunule excavated, but not dis- 

 tinctly defined. Surface appearing to the unassisted eye almost perfectly 

 smooth, excepting very regular, raised, concentric striag, or small costíe, on 

 the anterior part of the valves, with obscure traces of smaller stria3 crossing 

 the same. Under the highest power, however, that can be well used as a hand 

 magnifier, the whole surface is seen to be covered by an extremely minute, 

 perfectly regular, crowded sculpturing, as if made by crowded, microscopic 

 cross hnes, entirely invisible even under a good common pocket magnifier. 



Height of a small specimen, 0-90 inch ; convexity of same, 0-80 inch ; 

 length, about 1*18 inches. Other imperfect specimens show that the species 

 sometimes attained three or four times the size of that from which the above 

 measurements were taken. 



The extremely minute ornamentation mentioned on this shell may be prop- 

 erly considered microscopic, being entirely invisible under a good common 

 pocket lens, by the aid of which it shows apparently an almost polished 

 surface. When examined in a strong light, however, with a sufficiently high 

 magnifier, the finer markings are seen to present a delicacy, fineness, regu- 

 larity, and beauty that art could scarcely attain, even by the aid of the most 

 accurate mathematical ruling machine. In some specimens this delicate 

 marking has been, in places, partly removed, as if by the abrasion of an ex- 

 tremely thin externai layer, or epidermis, to which it appears to be, to some 

 extent, confined. When this layer has been in this way removed, however, 

 traces of the same marking can be seen on the surface of the layer beneath, 

 by the aid of a suffieiently strong magnifier. 



The stronger concentric, raised striae, or small costa?, seen on the anterior 

 part of the valves, do not run exactly parallel to the very obscure marks of 

 growth. but cross them obliquely. On following these little costae back 

 toward the gibbous part of the valves, they ali seem to become suddenly ob- 

 solete ; but on examining them with a common pocket lens, they are seen to 

 be continued over the convex part of the valves, as minute, impressed hair 

 lines, very regularly disposed, so as to leave comparatively rather wide spaces 

 between. Here, too, they are seen not to be exactly parallel to the faint 

 marks of growth, and on following them back they are observed to terminate 

 suddenly at a similar impressed hair-line, descending with a slight curve from 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 43 



the posterior side of each beak, apparently to near the middleof the posterior 

 margin. Above and behind this oblique line, some three, four, or more simi- 

 lar parallel, regularly disposed lines also extend from the back part of each 

 beak to the posterior margin of the valves, thus marking off, as it were, a 

 kind of corselet, somewhat similar to what we see in Protocardia, excepting 

 that these radiating lines are scarcely visible to the unassisted eye and.sepa- 

 rated by spaces many times their own breadth. In the spaces between these 

 posterior radiating lines the magnifier also shows numerous minute, raised 

 granules, but these are much larger and more prominent than, and entirely 

 distinct from, the extremely minute, crowded sculpturing seen by the aid of 

 a higher magnifier over the whole of the surface. It is probably mainly due 

 to the fact that the specimens have had the whole substance of the shell re- 

 placed by brilliant iron pyrites, that the delicate ornamentation mentioned 

 has been preserved. 



We know nothing of the nature of the hinge and interior of this beautiful 

 shell, and consequently only place it provisionally in the genus Schizodus. We 

 only know that other species found in our Coal-measures, agreeing apparently 

 in their internai characters with Schizodus, show the same kind of very minute 

 sculpturing seen on this. As some of these are very similar to the type on 

 which Mr. Conrad proposed to found his genus Prisconaia, from the Coal- 

 measures of Kansas, we requested him to examine his typical specimen to see 

 if any traces of such minute surface markings could be seen on it by the aid 

 of a strong magnifier, and he informed us that his shell shows the same 

 sculpturing. As this marking is very peculiar, and entirely unlike any orna- 

 mentation we have ever seen on any other fóssil, even in examples of various 

 types in exactly the same state of preservation, it is not improbable that our 

 shell will be found to possess the internai character of Mr. Conrad's type. 



Locality and position. From the shales over the fifth coal bed of the Illinois 

 Coal-measures, at Danville, of that State. For the use of the typical speci- 

 mens we are under obligations to Dr. J. C. Winslow, of Danville. 



Genus CLINOPISTHA, M. and W. 



Shell transversely oval, very thin, rather ventricose, equivalve, very inequi- 

 lateral; beaks near the posterior extremity and directed backward ; that of 

 the right valve with its immediate apex curving under the beak of the left, 

 which seems to be a little excavated for the reception of the same; ligament 

 externai, short, rather prominent, and occupying an oval, or lance-oval shal- 

 low cavity, formed by the slight inflection of the margins of the valves inime- 

 diately behind the beaks ; valves with their margins smooth within and closed 

 ali arouud ; hinge apparently edentulous ; surface polished, and with merely 

 fine lines or marks of growth, sometimes crossed by very faint traces of radi- 

 ating lines, which are usually obsolete externally, but often seen on internai 

 caats ; muscular impressions shallow, those of the anterior side larger than 

 the others and subquadrangular in form, with a faint oblique ridge along the 

 upper margin ; posterior muscular impressions oval and occupying somewhat 

 flattened spaces near the truncated margin ; pallial line faintly marked and 

 simple. 



Although we have not seen very clearly the hinge of this shell, we have 

 been able, from impressions of it in the matrix, to be satisfied that it is not 

 crenated, as in the Nuculidse and Arcidse ; and we believe it to be entirely 

 edentulous. In regard to the affinities of this type, however, we are left in 

 doubt. In its thinness, and the posterior position of its beaks, as well as in 

 the form and general appearance of its muscular and pallial impressions, and 

 its apparent edentulous hinge, it reminds one of Solenomya. It differs, how- 

 ever, from that genus, remarkably, in its short gibbous form, rather ventricose 

 beaks, and general physiognomy, as well as in wanting the internai ridge ex- 

 tending downward from the beaks, and apparently the partly internai liga- 



1870.] 




44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



ment. It likewise differs from the existing species of Solenomya in havingthe 

 valves neatly closed ali around, and the beak of its right valve curving under 

 that of the íeft. In this latter character, however, it agrees with the carbo- 

 niferous species of the West that have been referred to Solenomya, ali of which 

 have the point of the right beak passing under that of the left. and Prof. 

 McCoy has noticed this character in British carboniferous species. These 

 carboniferous species, however, agree almost exactly in ali their otherknown 

 characters with recent typical species of Solenomya, even to the general forni 

 'and the presence of an internai ridge under each beak, and differ as widely 

 from our shell in ali respects, excepting in the one character of the slight 

 inequality of the beaks, as the recent species of Solenomya do. 



We are aware that Prof. King proposed to found a genus Janeia, for the 

 reception of the carboniferous and permian forms usually referred to Soleno- 

 mya, and afterwards abandoned it, after farther comparisons with recent 

 species. As he makes no allusion to the inequality of the beaks, it is proba- 

 ble he had no specimens of the fóssil species with the two valves united. 

 From this character, and the greater excavation for the internai part of the 

 cartilage, under and extending a little in advance of the beaks, in the West- 

 ern carboniferous species referred to Solenomya, that we have had an oppor- 

 tunity to examine, we think it not improbable that the name Janeia may yet 

 have to be retained for the carboniferous and permian species, at least in a 

 subgeneric sense. Even in this case, however, it would still be necessary to 

 establish a new genus for our shell, in consequence of the differences already 

 noted, which separate it nearly as widely from the forms for which Janeia 

 were proposed as from the recent Solenomyse. 



It is proper to remark here, that some able conchologists, to whom we 

 showed specimens of the form under consideration, did not think it related 

 to Solenomya, as typified by the recent species, but more nearly allied to the 

 Anatinidse. As none of the numerous specimens of internai casts we have 

 had an opportunity to examine, however, showed any indications of a cavity 

 or process for the reception or attachment of an internai cartilage, as we see 

 in that family, and the pallial line has no traces of the sinus usually (though 

 not always) seen in the same, its relations to the Anatinidse seem to us 

 doubtful.

Edmondia ? radiala, Hall,(?) 1858. Iowa Geological Report, Vol. I, part 2, 

 Palseont., p. 716, pi. 29, fig. 3. 



Shell oval, approaching oblong, the height being from two-thirds to three- 

 fourths the length, moderately convex in young examples, and becoming ven- 

 tricose with age ; anterior side much longer and wider than the other, 

 regularly rounded in outline; posterior side very short, rather narrow below 

 the beaks, and vertically truncated; ventral margin most convex a little in 

 advance of the middle, thence round upward into the front, while behind the 

 middle, or nearly under the beaks, it is slightly contracted, or sinuous ; dorsal 

 outline subparallel to the base, the margins of the valves being erect anteri- 

 orly and rounding into the anterior margin; hinge line rather short ; beaks 

 rather ventricose, rising above the hinge line and placed about half way be- 

 tween the middle and the posterior end ; posterior umbonal slopes often ren- 

 dered somewhat prominently rounded by a slight flattening of the valves 

 behind the beaks, near the truncated margin ; ligament lance-oval in form, 

 rather short, and placed immediately behind the beaks, exactly in the position 

 we would expect to see the lunule if the shorter side of the valves were the 

 anterior ; surface with a polished appearance, and generally only showing fine 

 lines of growth, but in some examples also having obscure radiating marks 

 near the ventral margin, which are nearly always defined on internai casts. 



Length of a large specimen, 1 inch ; height, 0-62 inch ; convexity, 0-51 

 inch.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 45 



A careful examination of the typical specimen (now before us) of Edmondia? 

 radiata, of the Iowa Report, cited above, has clearly satisfied us that it nas 

 the ligament on the short side, and certainly belongs to the genus we have 

 here described, and we can scarcely doubt that it is really the saine species as 

 our type. As none of our numerous specimens, bowever, show tbe radiating 

 markings so distinctly as that described by Prof. Hall, we have concluded to 

 view them as belonging to a smooth variety, which we propose to designate 

 under the name levis. 



Locality and posiíion. Near base of Coal-measures, Seaville county, Illinois. 

 Prof. HalPs specimen came from the upper beds of the Coal-measures at 

 Grayville, Illinois. 



GASTEROPODA. 



Dentalium annulostriatum, M. and W. 



Shell very small, rather distinctly tapering and slightly arched : aperture 

 and section circular ; surface ornamented by regular, distinct, annular costae, 

 which pass around a little obliquely and are separated by rounded furrows of 

 the same breadth as the costas themselves. 



Length of a specimen incomplete at both ends, 0-28 inch ; diam. at the 

 larger end, 0-06 inch ; do. at the smaller end, 0-04 inch. 



Of this delicate little shell we have seen but a single specimen, which is 

 imperfect at both ends. At a first glance, it might be mistaken for another 

 more common species, of near the same size, occurring at the same locality, 

 and which we are incíined to think is the D. Meekianum of Geinitz. On exarn- 

 iaing it under a magnifier, however, it can be at once distinguished by its 

 comparatively strong, regular costas, instead of mere microscopic lines of 

 growth. 



It is with some doubt that we have referred this little shell to the genus 

 Dentalium, because its small size and comparatively strong, regular costae give 

 it much the appearance of the non-spiral part of the shell of a Csecum. It is 

 more arched, however, and more tapering than we generally see in the body 

 part of shells of that genus, which are likewise, we believe, unknown in any 

 of the Palaeozoic rocks. 



Locality and position. Shales over the Danville Coal, holding a position 

 about the horizon of the fifth Coal of the Illinois ; or, near the upper part of 

 the lower Coal-measures. 



Straparollus (Euomphalus) pernodosus, M. and W. 



Shell attaining a rather large size, subdiscoidal, or with the spire nearly on 

 a plane with the upper outer edge of the body volution ; umbilicus broad, 

 moderately deep, and showing ali the inner turns ; volutions about five and a 

 half, flattened-convex, and a little oblique ou the broad periphery, but dis- 

 tinctly carinated near the outer side above (the carina being rugose), while a 

 little outside of the middle below, they are prominent and ornamented by a 

 row of moderately distinct nodes, of which about sixteen may be counted on 

 the last turn ; those on the last half of the outer volution becoming nearly 

 or quite obsolete toward the aperture. Upper side of each whorl flattened 

 and sloping distinctly inward from the carina to the suture; lower side of 

 same sloping rapidly inward and slightly concave just within the prominent 

 nodose ridge, and then rounding rather abruptly into the umbilicus. Surface 

 marked by distinct lines, and at some places ridges, of growth : on the upper 

 side of the whorls these lines pass obliquely outward and forward from the 

 suture to the carina, thence obliquely backward in crossing the periphery ; 

 while in crossing the under side they curve a little backward. 



Greatest breadth of a specimen not quite complete at the aperture, 2-50 

 inches; height at the aperture, about 0-84 inch. 



1870.] 




46 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



This species is evidently closely allied to E. nodosus, of Sowerby, frotn the 

 Mountain Limestone of England. It may be distinguished, however, by its 

 much less convex periphery, and by having its carina on the upper side of the 

 outer whorl, nearer the outer side, as well as more rugose from an apparent 

 effort to form irregular nodes. The true nodes around the prominent portion 

 of its under side are more numerous than in E. nodosus (which has ten instead 

 of fourteen to eaeh whorl), and differ in being more irregular and nearly 

 obsolete on the last half of the outer whorl. 



Even if Montfort's name, Síraparollus, must be adopted for this genus, we 

 think Sowerbys name, Euomphalus, should be retained in a subgeneric sense 

 for these planorbicular species with angular whorls, such as E. pentangidatus, 

 for which it was atUrst proposed. 



Locality and position. Alton, 111. Lower Coal-measures. 



Straparollus (Euomphalus) subquadratus, M. and W. 



Shell attaining nearly a médium size, discoid or subplanorbicular, concave, 

 and showing ali the whorls both above and below, though the concavity is 

 deeper below than above. Periphery nearly fiat, rather broad, and generally 

 more or less oblique, with a distinct carina at the upper and lower edges, the 

 former of which is more acute than the other, and irregularly crenate, or sub- 

 nodose, and projecting nearly upward, while the lower one is a little rounded 

 and projects outward. Volutions five or six, not embracing, nor coiled ex- 

 actly in the same plane ; on the upper surface, each sloping, with a slight 

 concavity, distinctly inward from the marginal carina to the suture, while the 

 fiattened outer side usually has an obscure longitudinal sulcus near the upper 

 and lower angles, the upper one being a little deeper than the other. On the 

 under side the whorls slope gently inward from the marginal angle, so as to 

 form a broad, depressed-subconical umbilicus. Surface marked with rather 

 strongly defined lines of growth, which, at places, become subimbncating, or 

 form little irregular ridges. In crossing the upper side of the whorls, these 

 lines start, at first, nearly at right angles out from the suture, but curve a 

 little backward as they approach the marginal angle ; and immediately after 

 crossing this angle, and passing downward uponthe nearly vertically fiattened 

 periphery, they are defiected a little forward, but soon after pass straight down 

 to, and over the lower marginal angle to the under side, where they extend 

 obliquely backward and inward, with a rather distinct curve, to the immediate 

 vicinity of the suture, and then curve a little forward. Aperture and sections 

 of interior of whorls subcircular, or transversely oval. 



Greatest breadth of a specimen with apparently about one-third of the outer 

 volution broken away, 1-25 inches ; height, 0-50 inch. When entire, this spe- 

 cimen was probably not less than 1-43 inches in breadth. 



From the foregoing description, it will be seen that this shell is nearly allied 

 to the common western Coal Measure species figured and described by Prof. 

 Hall, in his Jour. Geological Report, under the name Euomphalus rugosus (not 

 E. rugosus, Sowerby*). Indeed, it is so nearly like that species that we atone 

 time suspected that it might be only a gigantb'. and more ventricose variety of 

 the same. Yet on comparing our shell with an extensive series of good spe- 

 cimens of E. rugosus, Hall, it is found to be greatly larger than any known 

 authentic examples of that shell, its breadth being a little more than twice 

 and a half that of the usual mature examples of E. rugosus. Its umbilicus, 

 and the concavity of its upper side, are also proportionally deeper, particularly 

 the former, while the fiattened outer side of its whorls is broader, and gener- 

 ally less oblique. Its lines of growth also differ in being rather distinctly de- 

 fiected backward at the marginal angle of the upper side, so as to indicate an 

 obscure sinus of the margin of the lip at the termination of this angle, though 



* If Sowerby's species is really congeneric, the American form called E. rugosus by Prof. 

 Hall might be distinguished by the specifíc name subrugosus. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 47 



there are no traces of a band, as in Pleurotomaria. This character would pro- 

 bably place the species in the group for which the name Schizosloma was pro- 

 posed by Bronn, but palaeontologists have generally regarded the type for 

 which that name was proposed, as not being sufficiently distinct from Euom- 

 phalus to be retained as a separate genus. 



Associated with the above, a single specimen was found, of the same size, 

 and agreeiug very closely with that from which the foregoing deseription was 

 drawn up, but differing in being proportionally wider, and not so oblique on 

 the periphery, Avhich is also more convex in the middle. The angle of its 

 under side also differs in being a little farther in from the outer margin, and 

 directed downward. instead of outward, while its umbilicus is proportionally 

 deeper. This may be a distinct species, but without more specimensfor com- 

 parison we do not feel willing to regard it as being entitled to a separate 

 name. 



These shells, including E. rugosus, Hall, and E. catilloides, Gonrad (sp.), are 

 related to E. quadratus of McCoy, from the Mountain Limestone of Ireland, 

 though sufficiently distinct specifically. At one time we were inclined to think 

 that E. rugosus, Hall, and E. catilloides, Conrad, together with a few others, 

 should be separated from Euomphalus, under a distinct generic name ; but 

 after seeing the large species we have here described, which so closely connect 

 these little shells with such forms as E. pentangulatus and E. catillus, upon 

 which the genus was originally founded, we can no longer doubt that ali of 

 these shells really belong to one genus. This series of intermediate forms 

 connecting the small, nearly planorbicular species mentioned above with the 

 typical forms of Euomphalus, shows clearly that none of the former belong to 

 the articulate genus Spirorbis, as has been thought by some, but that they are 

 really true mollusks.

Subdlites inplatus, M. and W. 



Shell very ventricose, subfusiform ; volutions about five and a half to six, 

 those of the spire moderately convex in the (externai?) cast ; last one very 

 large, ventricose, and composing much the larger part of the whole, produced 

 and contracted below so as apparently to terminate in a short canal ; aperture 

 narrow, rhombic and pointed, or angular above and below; suture well de- 

 fined in the cast; surface unknown. 



Height of a specimen with apparently about two whorls at the apex, and 

 portions of the lower extremityof the produced body whorl broken away, 1-85 

 inches; breadth of body volution, about 1-15 inches. 



It is barely possible that this may be a ventricose, fusiform Murchisonia, as 

 we only know it from rough casts, apparently of the exterior. As it shows 

 no traces, however, of any revolving band or line, aud has much the general 

 physiognomy of Subulites, we have concluded to refer it provisionally to that 

 group. 



Its most marked character is the large size and very ventricose form of its 

 body volution, in which it resembles some of the Carboniferous species of Ma- 

 crocheilus. It differs from these, however, in the produced and subcanaliculate 

 peculiarity of the lower part of its body whorl.

the same as Cryptoceras of D'Orbigny, published in 1850. This change of name 

 becomes necessary, however, because Dr. Barrande had used tbe name Crypto- 

 ceras for another widely distinct group of Cephalopoda in 1846. It is true he 

 has since changed the name of his genus to Ascoceras, for tbe reason that La- 

 treille had applied the name Cryptocerus to a genus of Hymenoptera in 1804. 

 But if Latreille's name Cryptocerus is not considered sufficiently distinct, on 

 account of its different termination, from Cryptoceras (which we should think 

 is the case), it would, for the same reason, of course, be equally necessary to 

 change the name of D'Orbigny's group. On the other hand, if we regard La- 

 treille's name as being distinct enough to permit D'Orbigny's name to stand 

 also, or if Latreille's genus is not a valid one, in either case Dr. Barrande's 

 original name Cryptoceras would have to be retained for his genus, and, as it 

 has priority of date, it would still become necessary to find another name for 

 the group described by D'Orbigny. 



The type of D'Orbigny's group was Nautilus dorsalis of Phillips, only known, 

 we believe, from a mere fragment, showing the siphuncle to be marginal, or 

 on the outer side of the curve, as in Ammonites* In this country we already 

 know several Carboniferous species that agree with D'Orbigny's type in the 

 character or position of the siphuncle, and we find in ali of these another re- 

 markable peculiarity of the lip on each side. That is, it is drawn so as to 

 form a kind of little canal, or spout-like channel, much as we see in Argonauta 

 gôndola, Adams. A good example of one of these shells is figured and described 

 by Dr. White and Prof. St. John, under the name Nautilus [Cryptoceras) Sprin- 

 geri, in vol. i, p. 124, of the Transactions of the Chicago Academy of Sciences 

 for 1867 ; and this may be regarded as the type of the group. It also includes 

 our N. (Cryptoceras) Leidyi, N. (Crypt.) capaz, and the species described below, 

 with possibly our N. (Crypt.) Rockfordensis. 



The mere fact that these shells have the siphuncle marginal, as in Amrnoni- 

 íes, would perhaps not alone be a sufficient reason for placing them in a sepa- 

 rate group from the typical Nautili, since the siphuncle occupies various po- 

 sitions in the different fóssil species of the latter. But when we take into 

 consideration the additional fact that the marginal position of the siphuncle 

 in these shells is always accompanied by the peculiar character of the lip we 

 have described, it becomes of more importance. 



Nautilus (Solenochilus) collectus, M. and W. 



Shell thin, attaining a moderate size, slightly compressed or subglobose in 

 general form ; umbilicus rather small, but deep, perforated, and provided 

 with very abrupt walls, particularly near the aperture. Volutions about one 

 and a half. increasing rapidly in size, and a little wider transversely than their 

 dorso-ventral diameter; moderately embracing, with a subquadrangular sec- 

 tion, the angles being rounded, and the lateral and outer or ventral surfaces 

 more or less flattened. Septa moderately concave, distant about one-fourth 

 the transverse diameter of the volutions at the point of measurement, and 

 showiug a slight backward curve in crossing the sides and periphery ; aper- 

 ture large, and, as near as can be determined from the specimens, wilh a sub- 

 quadrangular or subcircular outline, more or less sinuous on the inner side 

 for the reception of the small inner turn ; siphuncle small. Surface smooth, 

 or only showing small lines of growth. 



Greatest diameter of a small specimen, with body chamber broken away, 

 1-70 inch ; transverse diameter of same, about 1-25 inch. 



As in other species of this group, the small siphuncle is so very nearly in 

 contact with the ventral, or outer side, that in casts with the shell removed 

 it often gives the appearance of a very narro w, deep lobe along the middle of 

 that side. It is easy to see, however, that this appearance is merely produced 



* M. Chenu figures on p. 72, vol. i, of his Manual of Conchology, under the name Crypto- 

 ceras Bowerbankit, Sowerby, a shell certainly not belonging to D'Orbigny's group as he un- 

 derstood it, but, if correctly figured, belonging to the Ammonitidse.

by the breaking away of a thin part of the matrix between the siphuncle and 

 the outer shell. None of our specimens are in a condition to show the mar- 

 gins of the lip, but some of thera show very clearly the commencement of the 

 protuberance, or pinching up of the margin on each side near the umbilicus, 

 evidently terminating at the aperture in the usual spout-like auricles. The 

 lines of growth also show the same, by their flexures on each side. 



Specifically this shell is probably most nearly allied to our N. (Solenochilus) 

 Leidyi, from the Keokuk division of the Lower Carboniferous, though it differs 

 in having more rapidly expanding and subquadrangular whorls, which are 

 also slightly embracing at the aperture, instead of being merely in contact. 

 Its volutions, however, are much less rapidly expanding than in our iV. (Sol.) 

 o/paz, or in JY. Springeri of White and St. John, as well as different from both 

 in their subquadrangular form.

The only specimen of this fine species we have ever seen consists of about 

 half of one volution, which, being without septa, must belong to the part 

 composing the last or body chamber, originally occupied by the body of the- 

 animal. It is broken at both ends, and measures around the curve of the 

 outer side, 8-50 inches, with, at the larger end, a dorso-ventral diameter of 

 2-10 inches, and a transverse diann-ter (including the nodes) of 3-60 inches. 

 The dorso-ventral diameter at the smaller end is about 1-60 inches, and the 

 transverse about 2-40 inches. A section of the body volution is transversely 

 subelliptical, with a tendency to an oblong outline ; the outer (often called 

 the dorsal) side of the whorl being very broad and flattened convex, and each 

 lateral margin, exclusive of the nodes, being rather narrowly rounded, or a 

 little flattened, while the inner side is a little concave. The broad flattened 

 outer side has two very obscure longitudinal ridges, with a distinctly flattened 

 space between. Along each (so-called) dorso-lateral margin there is a row 

 of prominent flattened nodes, arranged at intervals of about their own greater 

 (antero-posterior) diameter. About sixteen of these nodes occupied each 

 side of the outer or last volution. The inner side of the whorl rounds regu- 

 larly into the umbilicus, which appears to be wider than the dorso-ventral 

 diameter of the volution at the aperture. The surface is without longitudinal 

 lines, but the stria? of growth are moderately distinct, especially on the broad 

 flattened outer side, where they make a deep backward curve in crossing, so 

 as to indicate the presence of a very deep sinus in the lip on that side of the 

 aperture of the shell. 



In the specimen described, the substance of the shell is thin, and scarcely 

 mineralized, though it retains no pearly lustre. 



This species resembles very closely the form figured by Prof. McChesney in 

 the memoir cited at the head of the foregoing description, and referred by 

 him (by mistake) in the explanations of his plates, to his iV. nodocarinatus. 



Our shell differs, however, in not having so many nodes, as well as in hav- 

 ing a proportionally wider umbilicus, and particularly in having the sides of 

 its whorls rounding regularly into the umbilicus, instead of being subcarinate 

 around its margins.

Nautilus (Temnochilus) Winslowi, M. and W. 



Shell attaining a moderately large size, subdiscoidal ; periphery broad and 

 nearly flat, the middle third being rather distinctly flattened, while on each 

 side of this there is a very slight slope outward to the lateral margins. Um- 

 bilicus broad, moderately deep, and showing nearly the full breadth of each 

 inner volution on each side. Volutions apparently about four and a half, 

 with transverse diametar nearly one-third greater than the dorso-ventral ; 

 each ornamented around the lateral margins of the broad periphery by about 

 sixteen very prominent, rounded nodes, which project obliquely outward, at 

 an angle about intermediate between the general plane of the shell and that 

 of the broad periphery, those on opposite sides being alternately arranged ; 

 from these rows of nodes the sides slope abruptly inward, with a moderate 

 convexity, to their inner margins within the umbilicus. Surface marked by 

 rather well defined lines of growth, which curve gently backward in crossing 

 the sides of the whorls from the inner margin, and make a stronger backward 

 curve in crossing the periphery, so as to indicate the presence of a deep 

 rounded sinus in the outer margin of the lip. (Siphuncle and septa unknown.) 



Greatest breadth of a specimen with a part of the outer volution broken 

 away, 4-60 inches ; transverse diameter of outer turn, measuring across the 

 periphery without including the nodes, 2-46 inches ; do. including the nodes, 

 2-95 inches ; dorso-ventral diameter of the outer volution, 1-66 inches. 



This species Í3 evidently closely allied to the last, in form and general ap- 

 pearance, but differs in having its volutions proportionally narrower, measur- 

 ing at right angles to the plane of the shell. Its most marked difference, 

 however, consists in the form of its nodes, which are round, instead of being 

 distinctly compressed. It seems to be also related to 2f. tuberculatus of Sow- 

 erby, but differs from the published figures of that species in having its peri- 

 phery proportionally broader, and distinctly more flattened; while its nodes 

 are placed nearer the outer margin of the whorls, as well as more prominent. 

 From N. Occidenlalis, Swallow, (= N. quadrangular is, McChesney), it will be 

 readily distinguished by the greater transverse diameter of its whorls, which 

 are also without the flattened sides of that species, and differ in wanting the 

 two mesial rows of nodes on the periphery. 



This specific name of this fine Nautilus is given in honor of Dr. J. C. Wins- 

 low, of Danville, Illinois, to whom we are indebted for the use of the specimen 

 from which the description was drawn up. 



Locality and position. Danville, Illinois, from the shale over the fifth bed of 

 coal, of the corrected Illinois section ; being near the horizon of the upper 

 part of the Lower Coal-Measures. 



Nautilus (Temnochilus) Coxands, M. and W. 



Shell rather small, subdiscoidal, broadly rounded, or depressed convex 

 over the periphery; umbilicus wide, rather deep, perforated, and showing 

 more than three-fourths of the dorso-ventral diameter of each inner turn. 

 Volutions about two and a half to three, increasing gradually in size, wider 

 transverstly than dorso-ventrally, very síightly concave along the dorsal or 

 inner side for the reception of the periphery of each succeeding turn within, 

 more or less narrowly rounded (subangular in some small specimens) and 

 ornamented by about fifteen small nodes around the middle of each side, 

 from which point the inner side rounds very abruptly into the umbilicus. 

 Septa separated, on the outer or ventral side, by space about one-fifth or one- 

 sixth the transverse diameter of the volutions at the point of measurement ; 

 arching very síightly backward in crossing the periphery. Body chamber 

 composing about half of the outer volution. Siphuncle small. and situated 

 subcentrally, or somewhat nearer the outer side. Surface ornamented with 

 distinct, regular, longitudinal, raised lines, or small costae, narrower than the

rounded furrows between ; those along the middle of the ventral or outer side 

 beiag sraaller and more crowded than those toward the lateral regions ; cross- 

 ing these are numerous very fine, crowded striae of growth, which curve 

 Strongly backward in passing over the periphery, parallel to the margin of 

 the very profound sinus in the lip on the ventral side.* Aperture trans- 

 versely oval. 



Greatest diameter of a mature specimen, 2-23 inches; thickness, or trans- 

 verse diameter, about one inch ; dorso-ventral diameter of last turn near 

 aperture, 0-86 inch. 



Among the specimens before us there seem to be two varieties, which may 

 possibly prove to be specifically distinct. One of these, which we regard as 

 the typical form of the species, has the periphery very depressed-eonvex, 

 while in the other, this part is distinctly more convex or rounded. As they 

 agree, however, apparently almost exactly in ali other characters, and both 

 forms vary somewhat in the convexity of the periphery, we are inclined to 

 view this as merely a sexual diíference. In the more convex forms the lateral 

 nodes seem to be generally a little more inclined to become slightly elongated 

 in the transverse direction of the whorls, though this character appears not 

 to be entirely constant. In both forms the longitudinal or revolving surface 

 ridges and furrows become nearly or quite obsolete, toward the aperture, on 

 the outer volution. 



Internai casts of this species seem to be almost exactly like specimens 

 figured by European authorities under the name N. íubrculatus, Sowerby. As 

 that species, however, attains a much larger size, and has, according to Prof. 

 McCoy's description, a very large siphuncle, while none of the figures or de- 

 scriptions of it we have seen either show or mention the distinct longitudinal, 

 or revolving costae, so well defined on the surface of our species, we can 

 entertain no doubt in regard to its being clearly distinct. It is true the 

 figures of N"i tuberculatus alluded to ali represent only internai casts, while 

 the longitudinal markings mentioned on our shell are not seen on internai 

 casts ; but it is scarcely possible that such markings would never have been 

 observed, as impressions in the matrix, if not otherwise, had they existed in 

 Sowerby's species. 



This species is naraed in honor of Prof. E. T. Cox, State Geologist of In- 

 diana.

 concave on both sides ; volutions four or more, slightly embracing, increas- 

 ing very gradually in size, with transverse section nearly or quite circular, 

 excepting the slight concavity on the inner side. Surface ornamented by 

 numerous distinct, very regularly arranged costae, which cross the sides of 

 the volutions very obliquely backward from the inner side, curving strongly 

 backward as they approach the periphery, and after crossing the middle of 

 the same, again deflected forward as on the opposite side, thus indicating a 

 profound sinus in the outer side of the lip ; the sinus being very narrow, but 

 not exactly angular at its termination, and widening rapidly forward ; fine, 

 somewhat imbricating striae of growth also run parallel to the costa?. Septa 

 apparently moderately distant and running nearly straight across the sides.

As we have not seen the siphuncle, or the free part of the body chamber of 

 this species it may, possibly, not be a true Lituite. Still, as there is not the 

 slightest appearance of any obliquity of the volutions, as in the genus Trocho- 

 ceras, we have scarcely any doubt in regard to its being a true Lituite. Com- 

 pared with Lituites Marshii, of Hall, (20th Ann. Rep. Regents Univ., N. Y., pi. 

 16, figs. 6 and 7,) from the same horizon, at Kankakee, in this State, our 

 species will be at once seen to differ in having its volutions more compactly 

 coiled together, much less rapidly increasing in size, and ornamented with 

 smaller and much more closely arranged costae. Its costae also make a stronger 

 or deeper backward curve in crossing the periphery, which is rounded instead 

 of being flattened, as in the Marshii. In general appearance it is more like 

 L. (Trocholites) ammonius, of Conrad, from the Lower Silurian, though its 

 costa? are much more oblique, and differ in being separated by rounded fur- 

 rows quite as w ide as the costae themselves ; while its surface shows no traces 

 of the finer sculpturing seen on that shell.

CRUSTÁCEA. 



Phillipsia tubebculata, M. and W. 



Attaining a large size. Head and thorax unknown. Pygidium semielliptic, 

 the length being very nearly four-íifths the breadth, very convex ; posterior 

 margin obtusely rounded ; lateral margins diverging rapidly forward, with 

 convex outlines. Axial lobe well defined, obtuse, and rather prominent behind, 

 and gradually widening forward, with nearly straight sides ; rather distinctly 

 more elevated than the lateral lobes, which it nearly equals in breadth at the 

 anterior end, as seen in a direct view from above, but one-fourth narrower 

 than the latter, measuring over the curve of each ; showing sixteen or seven- 

 teen straight, well defined segment, each of which is provided with six small 

 tubercles, arranged so as to forni six rows. Lateral lobes with about fourteen 

 segments each, the very short posterior ones being nearly on a line with the 

 axial lobe, while the others grow gradually more transverse anteriorly, so 

 as to show only a moderate obliquity toward the front ; ali extending down 

 so as to leave only a very narrovv, undefined, smooth marginal space, and 

 each ornamented by from two or three to about twelve tubercles, the number 

 increasing regularly with the length of the segments toward the anterior. 

 Surface between the segments and tubercles smooth. 



Length of pygidium, 0-95 inch ; breadth, 1 45 inches; convexity, 0-40 inch. 



This fine species resembles P. omatus, Portlock, perhaps more nearly than 

 any other, but it attains a larger size, and its pygidium is more broadly rounded 

 behind, with its mesial lobe less rapidly tapering posteriorly; while the rows 

 of tubercles on the segments of its lateral lobes are distinctly more numerous. 

 In general outline, its pygidium more nearly resembles a form figured by 

 Prof. de Koninck, under the name Phillipsia gemmuli/era, Phillips, (Animaux 

 Foss., pi. liii, fig. 4), though its axial lobe is distinctly narrower, while its 

 lateral lobes are merely provided with tubercles, along the segments, instead 

 of short spines.

Phillipsia (Gbifpithides) bufo, M. and W. 



Entire outline elliptical, the breadth being to the length as 75 to 130. Ce-

 straight behind ; posterior lateral angles terminatingin short, abruptly pointed 

 spines extending back to the anterior edge oí" the third thoracic segment. 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 53 



Glabella rather depressed convex, wide anteriorly and narrowing posteriorly 

 to the neck furrow, just in front of which, and connected with the palpebral 

 lobes on each side, it has a single small, obscure lateral lobe ; neck furrow 

 broad, and well defined both across the glabella and across the posterior mar- 

 gins of the cheeks ; neck segraent rather wide, depressed below the levei of 

 the highest part of the glabella in front of it. Eyes of moderate size. reniform, 

 nearly as prominent as the glabella, plaeed but little in front of the eontinua- 

 tion of the neck furrow across the cheeks, apparently smooth, but showing, 

 when the outer crust is removed, numerous very minute lenses beneath. 

 Cheek sloping off rather abruptly from the eyes to the thickened raargin, 

 which does not continue around the front of the glabella ; facial sutures cut- 

 ting the anterior margin in front of the eyes before, and a little outside of 

 them behind. 



Thorax nearly twice as wide as long, distinctly trilobate ; mesial lobe but 

 moderately prominent, nearly twice as wide as either of the lateral lobes, its 

 eight segments merely rounded and without furrows. Lateral lobes narrow ; 

 pleurse curving moderately downwards at less than half their length out from 

 the axial lobe, but not distinctly geniculated, each provided with a furrow ex- 

 tending nearly half-way out. Pygidium approaching semi-circular, with the 

 anterior lateral angles obliquely truncated ; mesial lobe but slightly wider an- 

 teriorly than the lateral ; segments about eleven ; lateral lobes with eight or 

 nine segments. 



Surface finely granular, the granules being most distinct on the glabella, 

 and the segments of the mesial lobe of the thorax. 



This species will be at once distinguished from our P. Portlockii, from the 

 same horizon, by its much broader and less ventricose glabella, and the pecu- 

 liar tuberculiform eyes of that species, as well as by the broader and less pro- 

 minent mesial lobe of the pygidium, in the form under consideration.

Asaphus (Isotelus) vigilans, M. and W. 



Body small, elliptic in general form, and moderately convex. Head rather 

 more than half as long as wide, approaching a subcrescentic outline, with the 

 posterior lateral angles abruptly rounded or subangular ; anterior margin ap- 

 parently somewhat narrowly rounded ; posterior outline broadly and distinctly 

 concave, but rather straight along the middle, without any traces of marginal 

 or occipital furrows. Glabella not rising above the general convexity of the 

 head, and entirely undefined by any traces of dorsal furrows. Eyes situated 

 about their own antero-posterior diameter in advance of the posterior margin, 

 and apparently about half way between the latter and the front, rather widely 

 separated from each other, and very prominent, nearly round, and truncato- 

 sub-conic in form ; visual surface elevated almost entirely above the general 

 convexity, and curved around so as to form about three-fourths of a circle, 

 presenting a smooth surface ; palpebral lobes as elevated as the eyes, and much 

 contracted, or merely connected with the glabella on the inner side by a 

 narrow neck. Facial sutures extending obliquely outward and backward from 

 the eyes behind, so as to intersect the posterior margin about half-way be- 

 tween a line drawn longitudinally through the middle of each eye, and the 

 posterior lateral margins of the cheeks; and in front, at first curving slightly 

 outward a little in advance of each eye, beyond which point they converge 

 forward so as apparently to intersect the front margin in such a manner as to 

 leave a rather narrow anterior edge to the glabella.*

rolled-up specimen, showing scarcely any traces of trilobation, and composed 

 of eight segments. Mesial lobe, as indicated by very faint impression on each 

 side of the body segment, very wide and depressed, with segments nearly flat. 

 Lateral lobes very narrow, sloping oíf regularly from the mesial one on each 

 side ; pleuroe without furrows, and with the exposed surfaces seen in a rolled- 

 up speciraen, narrowing oíf laterally very rapidly, with a strong backward 

 curve ; ali more or less angular at the extremity, the posterior ones being 

 rather pointed ; lapping surfaces apparently wide. 



Pygidium subtrigonal and of near the same size as the head, entirely without 

 any indications of trilobation or segments. 



Whole surface smooth, excepting a minute pitting, most distinct on the 

 movable cheeks. 



Length (measuring over the curve of the specimen as rolled together), 2-75 

 inches; breadth, 1-30 inch ; length of head at the middle, about 0-75 inch ; 

 breadth between the eyes, 0-47 inch ; height of eyes on the outer side, 0-20 

 inch. Breadth of axial lobe of thorax, 0-85 inch ; antero-posterior diameter 

 of each of the first four or five segments of same near middle, 0-15 inch. 



This species seems not to be nearly related to any of the described forms 

 with which we are acquainted. Its most marked characters are the promi- 

 nence of its eyes, and the almost entire absence of any traces of trilobation in 

 its thorax and pygidium, as well as the great breadth of the mesial lobe of the 

 same, as indicated by a very obscure depression, and a minute projection on 

 the anterior margin of each thoracic segment, on a line nearly behind the outer 

 edge of each eye. These little projections donotextend upward, but forward, 

 and fit into corresponding notches in the posterior margin of each succeeding 

 segment in front. As the anterior margin of its head and the posterior edge 

 of its pygidium are in the specimens more or less imperfect, we cannot deter- 

 mine exactly their outlines. 



In some respects this species resemblesyoung individuais of Isotelus megistos, 

 of Lock, though it differs in not having its cheeks produced into pointed ter- 

 minations behind, while its eyes are more prominent and situated farther for- 

 ward, and the mesial lobes of its thorax much less defined and distinctly 

 wider. Its pleura? also differ in being angular, or a little pointed, instead of 

 rounded at the ends.

Attaining a rather large size. Head (as determined from internai cast) 

 transversely subelliptic, as seen from above, when placed with the under side 

 on a horizontal plaae, its breadth being to its length very nearly as 50 to 30 ; 

 moderately convex, the height being rather distinctly less than half the 

 breadth, and the most prominent part a little behind the middle, while the 

 curve over the middle, from its posterior to its anterior margin, forms about a 

 quarter of a circle. Anterior margin, as seen from above, presenting a nearly 

 transversely semi-elliptic curve, and a subrectangular outline, as seen in a 

 side view ; lateral margins rather narrowly and regularly rounded in outline, 

 into the posterior side. Axial furrows distinct, converging forward to a point 

 nearly opposite the middle of each eye, where they terminate in little flattened 

 oval impressions. Eyes large, forming nearly semi-circular curves, with their 

 posterior ends as near the posterior as to the lateral margins of the head ; 

 each with a broad, very deep, rounded furrow around beneath its outer side, 

 so as to form a kind of obtuse shoulder below, from which the cheeks drop off 

 nearly vertically, with a slight convexity of outline, to the inferior margins ; 

 palpebral lobes less elevated than the middle of the glabella, and sloping a 

 little outward, with an even convexity over their whole surface; visual surface 

 forming rather narrow convex bands, and showing (in the internai cast) under

 and obtuse lateral extremities; just three times as wide as its antero-posterior

Length of head, about 1 20 inches ; breadth of do., 2-47 inches; height or 

 convexity, 1-05 inch. Length of eyes, 055 inch ; height of visual surface of 

 same, 0-10 inch ; distance between the eyes at posterior and anterior ends, 1-65 

 inch. 



This fine species is perhaps most nearly allied to the common and widely 

 distributed I. Barriensis of Murchison. It may be readily distinguished, how- 

 ever, by several important differences in the head, which is the only part yet 

 known to us. In the first place, its head is much wider in proportion to its 

 length, and has its lateral margins, as seen from above, much more narrowlv 

 and regularly rounded in outline, so that the cheeks do not project any farther 

 out from the eyes posteriorly than laterally, the outline of the lateral margins 

 having almost exactly the same curve as the eyes themselves. Its rostral 

 shield also has a very different form from that of Murchison's species, being 

 narrower in its antero-posterior diameter, and distinctly obtuse, instead of 

 pointed, at the lateral extremities. Our species likewise shows no traces of 

 the furrows on the cast of the upper side of the head, so strongly marked in 7. 

 Bar ri ends. 



It is still more widely removed from I. imignh of Hall ; and we know of no 

 desçribed species having the head so nearly elliptic in outline (transversely | 

 as seen from above, excepting possibly I. Salteri of Barrande, which, however. 

 diflfers widely in other characters, belonging, as it does, to the small-eyed 

 section of the genus. 



Locality and position. Grafton, Illinois, from the Niagara division of the 

 Upper Silurian. 



DlTHYROCARIS CARBONARIUS, M. and W. 



We only know this fóssil from a specimen showing the caudal appendages. 

 — that is, the telson and stylets.* These are lanceolate in general outline, and 

 rather flattened. The telson seems to be a little shorter than the stylets, aud 

 more rapidly tapering toward the extremity. Below it is flat, and has a faint. 

 undefined, obtuse longitudinal ridge along the middle, with on each side an 

 equally undefined, shallow sulcus between this and the lateral margins, which 

 are sharp. On its upper side there is a well defined mesial carina, with a 

 slightly concave slope on each side to the lateral margins, thus presenting 

 much the form of a broad bayonet. The stylets have each, on the flattened 

 under side, about six or seven small longitudinal ridges, and on the upper side 

 a distinct longitudinal mesial carina, between which and the lateral margins 

 there is on each side a smooth rounded concavityor broad furrow ; along each 

 lateral margin there are two closely approximated earinae, oue above, and one 

 below with a narrow rounded sulcus between. 



Length of telson, about 0-75 inch ; breadth of do., 012 inch; length of sty- 

 lets, about 080 inch ; breadth of same near the articulating end. 012 inch. 



This species will be readily distinguished from D. Scouleri of McCoy, by its 

 proportionally broader and more lanceolate stylets and telson, the latter of 

 which is also smooth instead of being marked byoblique divaricating striae, as 



* If the middle one of the three nearly equal caudal appendages in this genus i.» not 

 articulated at its base, it would only be properly an attenuated terminal part of the telson. 

 and not the whole of that segment.

in the Scouleri. Its stylets are also flattened and carinated, instead of being 

 rounded. From Portlock's C. Colei it will be distinguished by having the 

 carinae of its stylets and telsoti sinooth, instead of crenate. 



So far as we are informed, this is the fírst species of this genus found in 

 America. It is another decidedly Carboniferous genus, found in our Coal 

 Mensures, directly associated with numerous fossils that occur in the beds on 

 the Missouri, in Nebraska, that have been wrongly referred by some authors 

 to the Permian (Dyas). 



Locality and posiíion. Near the middle of the Coal Measures at Danville, 

 Illinois, associated with numerous Upper Coal Measure species.

Washington Citt, March 2l8t, 1870. 



PlIOF. JOSEPH LeIDT. 



Dear Sir, — I send herewith, to be presented for publication in the Proceedings of the 

 Academy, descriptions of a few of the fossils brought in by the United States Geological 

 Survey under the direction of Clerence King, Esq. You will please state, in presenting 

 the paper, that the Trilobites described in it írom Eastern Nevada, are decidedly Primor- 

 dial types, and, so far as I know, the first fossils of that age yet brought in from any loca- 

 lity west of the Black Hills. Mr. King's collections also establish the fact that the rich 

 silver mines of the White Pine district occur in Devonian rocks, though the Carbonife- 

 rous is also well developed there. The Devonian beds of that district yet known by their 

 fossils, seem mainly to belong to the upper part of the system. Mr, King, however, has a 

 few fossils from Pinon Station, Central Nevada, that ,appear to belong to the horizon of 

 the Upper Helderberg limestone of the New York series. 



The Tertiary fossils described in this paper, from the region of Hot Spring Mountains, 

 Idaho, carne from an extensive and interesting fresh-water Lacustrine deposit, and are ali 

 distinct specifically.and some generically, from ali the other Tertiary fossils yet brought 

 from the far west. Two of the species belong to the existing Califórnia genus Carinifex, 

 or some closely allied group, while another beautifully sculptured species was thought, 

 by Mr. Tryon, to whom I sent a specimen of it, to be possibly a true Melania, and allied to 

 existing Asiatic forms. 



It is an interesting fact, that among ali of our fresh-water Tertiary shells from this dis- 

 tant internai part of the Continent, neither the beaks of the bivalves, nor the ápices of the 

 spire in the univalves, is ever in the slightest degree eroded; even the most delicate 

 markings on these parts being perfectly preserved, ifnot broken by some accident. From 

 this fact it may be inferred that the waters of the lakes and streams of this region, dur- 

 ing the Tertiary epoch, were more or less alkaline, as is the case. with many of those 

 there at the presentday. 



These descriptions, as well as others that I expect to send you soon, are merely prelim- 

 inary and will bere-written, and presented with full illustrations, now in course of prepa- 

 ration, in Mr. King's report of his survey. 



Very respectfully yours,

Tertiary Species. 

 Sphjerium rugosum, Meek. 



Shell of médium size, rather gibbou3, moderately thick, quadrato-suborbic- 

 ular in outline, the length being a little greater than the height ; greatest con- 

 vexity slightly above the middle; anterior margin more or less regularly 

 rounded; base semielliptic in outline; posterior margin generally a little 

 wider than the anterior, and faintly subtruncate with an anterior slope ; dor- 

 sal outline rounding into the anterior and posterior margins, but more regu- 

 larly into the former. Beaks not eroded, nearly central, rather prominent and 

 incurved, but not oblique. Surface ornament-d by sharply defined, often ele- 

 vated, concentric strise, separated by rounded furrows, in which very minute 

 lines of growth may be seen under a magnifier; the elevated concentric striae 

 becoming more regular, coarser, more distantly separated, and more promi- 

 nent on the umbones. Cordinal margin and lateral teeth comparatively 

 stout, 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 57 



Length of largest specimen, 0-34 inch ; height, 0-30 inch ; convexity, 28 

 inch. 



The most marked characteristics of this species, are its quadrato-suborbic- 

 ular, rather gibbous form, very nearly central beaks, and particularly its 

 sharply elevated concentric striae, growing stronger, more prominent, and 

 more distantly separated on the umbones, until near the points of the same 

 they often assume the character of sharp, raised plications. In some of the 

 smaller specimens, these raised, rather distantly separated, stronger striae, ex- 

 tend over nearly the whole surface ; wbile in others the}' pass gradually into 

 mere irregular lines of growth, on most of the surface, occasionally separated 

 by wider furrows. 



In form this species is very similar to the existing S. Vermontanum, of Prime, 

 with which it also agrees nearly in size* It is more regularly rounded in 

 front, however, and has stouter lateral teeth ; while its concentric raised 

 striae and sulcations are generally larger and grow more distinct on the um- 

 bones than below, instead of the reverse. In this latter character of marking 

 it agrees more nearly with S. aureum, Prime, from which, however, it differs 

 entirely in form. 



Locality and position. Hot Spring Mountains, at Fóssil Hill, Idaho Terri- 

 tory. 



Sphjerium? Idahoense, Meek. 



Shell attaining a very large size, moderately convex, rather thick in propor- 

 tion to size ; orbicular-subovate in outline, being wider in front than posteri- 

 orly ; anterior margin regularly rounded ; base semioval in outline ; posterior 

 margin somewhat narrowly rounded below and sloping forward above ; dorsal 

 margin short. Beaks placed in advance of the middle, a little compressed 

 and directed obliquely forward and inward. Surface marked by concentric 

 striae and furrows. Later teeth stout. 



Length, 0-98 inch ; height, about 92 inch ; convexity, about 0-54 inch. 



The specimens of this shell are not in a very good state of preservation, 

 being, with oue exception, internai casts, and this one only retains a part of 

 the shell. They certainly differ, however, from the last not only in their much 

 larger size, but in being less nearly equilateral, more produced, and rather 

 more narrowly rounded posterioríy, as well as proportionally less convex. 

 The internai casts have the umbonal region, from a little above the middle 

 of the valves, compressed. Some of these casts show a few rather distinct, 

 broad, irregular concentric undulations, that were doubtless more strongly 

 defined on the exterior ,of the valves. 



None of the specimens of this shell show the hinge very clearly, but from 

 its large size and thickness I was at first inclined to believe it a Òyrena or a 

 Corbicula. Impressions ih the matrix, however, show that its lateral teeth are 

 not striated, nor of the forra seen in the latter genus. Possibly, I should call 

 . it Cyrena Idahoensis. As its pallial line is certainly simple, however. and not 

 sinuous, as in ali the American living species, and, so far as known, in ali the 

 fóssil Cyrenas and Corbiculas of this continent, I have concluded to place it 

 provisionally in the genus Sphcerium, until better specimens can be obtained 

 for study. 



Locality and position. Same as last, and from same formation at Castle 

 Creek, Idaho. 



Ancylus undulatds, Meek. 



Shell thin, attaining a very large size, elliptic-oval in outline, being some- 

 times slightly widest a little in advance of the middle; apex much elevated, 

 pointed, curved backward and placed about half-way between the middle and 

 the posterior margin ; posterior slope concave; lateral slopes nearly straight; 

 anterior slope distinctly convex. Surface marked with fine, rather obscure

58 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACABEMY OF 



lines of growth, and strong, comparatively large concentric undulations, most 

 distinct and regular on the anterior slope, where there are sometimes very 

 obscure traces of about three radiating ridges. 



Length of the largest specimea seen, 0*67 inch ; breadth of do., 0-54 inch ; 

 height, 0-35 inch. 



The specimens show some variation in their proportions, as well as in the 

 regularity and distinctness of the undulations, the largest individual from 

 which the above measurements were taken being proportionally a little wider 

 and more elevated than some of the smaller ones, while its undulations are 

 less distinctly and regularly defined. As there are various gradations, how- 

 ever, in these characters, I am at present inclined to regard them as mere in- 

 dividual modifications of one species. 



Owing to the thinness of the shell, the undulations are often quite well de- 

 fined ou internai casts, particularly along the anterior slope. 



The only N. American recent species, with which I am acquainted, that ap- 

 proacbes this in size, is the A. Newberryi, describcd by Dr. Lea, from Califór- 

 nia. From this the species under consideration diífers in having its apex 

 nearer the posterior, and much more pointed and curved backward. The 

 undulations of its anterior slopes also give the shell quite a different appear- 

 ance. 



Locality and position. Fóssil Hill, Hot Spring Mountains, Idaho Territory. 



Melania (Goniobasis?) scdlptilis, Meek. 



Shell of médium size, conoid-subovate ; spire more or less elongate-coni- 

 cal, with convex slopes, the apical angle being greater in the young than in 

 the adult, not eroded at the apex; volutions six to seven, rather distinctly 

 convex ; suture strongly channeled ; aperture ovate, a little oblique, rather 

 narrowly rounded below; lip sharp, most prominent below the middle, and 

 slightly sinuous at the lower inner side. Surface elegantly ornamented by 

 numerous very regularly disposed, slightly flexuous or sigmoid vertical costa?, 

 which are crossed by equally distinct and regular spiral ridges, about four of 

 which may be counted on each volution of the spire (excepting those near 

 the apex, which are smooth), and eight to ten on the l'a st turn, on the under 

 half of which they are most strongly defined; minute lines of growth may 

 also be seen by the aid of a magnifier; costa? slightly nodulous at the points 

 where they are crossed by the little revolving ridges. 



Length, 0-63 inch ; breadth, 0-33 in. 



This is a neat species, remarkable for its sharply defined and very regular 

 cancellated sculpturing. The vertical costse are equally well defined on ali 

 the volutions excepting those near the apex and on the under side of the last 

 one, while the revolving lines or ridges become a little more distinct on the 

 lower part of the body turn. Although there are nearly always four of these 

 revolving ridges on the volutions- above the last one, in a few examples as 

 many as six may be counted on these tuins, but this is due to the intercala- 

 tion of a smaller one between two of the others, and the exposure of another 

 above the suture, that is usually hidden beneath it by each succeeding turn. 



Locality and position. Hot Spring Mountains, Idaho. 



Melania (Goniobasis) subsculptilis, Meek. 



Shell apparently not attaining a médium size ; spire conical with convex 

 slopes ; apex pointed, not eroded; volutions about seven and a half, flattened 

 convex; suture channeled; aperture ovate, slightly oblique, rather abruptly 

 rounded below; margin of lip most prominent below the middle, and faintly 

 sinuous on the lower inner side. Surface ornamented with small, regular, 

 slightly sigmoid, vertical costa?, with an obscure revolving ridge just below, 

 and a slight angle above, the suture, to which prominences the costa? impart 



[April, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 59 



a somewbat crenated appearance ; lower half of last turn marked with a few 

 distinct revolving raised liaes. 



Length, 0-43 inch ; breadth, 0-19 inch ; length of aperture, 0-14 inch ; 

 breadth of do., 0-10 inch. 



This species may be at once distinguished from the last by its less convex 

 whorls, and the absence of revolving ridges or lines, excepting on the lower 

 part of the body volution, and the one just below and above the suture. As 

 in the last, its apical whorls are smooth. The only good specimen of it seen 

 is considerably smaller than the adult size of the last described species. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Carinifex Binneyi, Meek. 



Shell attaining a large size, depressed subglobose in form ; spire scarcely 

 rising above the body whorl; umbilicus large, but rapidly contracting within. 

 Volutions about three and a half, increasing very rapidly in size ; those of the 

 spire a little convex, last one forming more than nine-tenths the entire bulk 

 of the shell, widest above, and produced below so as to form a prominent 

 ridge or subangular margin around the widely excavated umbilical region ; 

 ali without revolving carinre. Aperture large, obovate, being widest above 

 and narrowed abrubtly to a subangular termination below. Lip remarkably 

 oblique, apparently reflexed and strongly produced forward above. Surface 

 marked with extremely oblique lines of growth, which sometimes form little 

 regular costae. 



Height, 0-59 inch; breadth, 1 inch; height of aperture, about 0-50 inch ; 

 breadth of do., 0-54 inch. 



This species differs too widely in nearly ali of its characters to require any 

 comparison with C. Newberryi, the typical and only known living species, 

 which it also exceeds in size. 



Ali of the specimens of this species in the collection are incrusted by a 

 laminated, smooth calcareous deposit, that has to be removed before the sur- 

 face marking can be seen. This is continuous over the suture, and covers ali 

 the volutions of the spire. At first I was inclined to think this might have 

 been secreted by the mantle of the animal enveloping the whole shell ; but 

 farther examinations have led me to think it more probably merely an 

 inorganic incrustation, precipitated over the surface after the death of the 

 animal. Named in honor of W. G. Binney, Esq. 



Locality and position. Fóssil Hill, Hotspring Mountains, Idaho Territory. 

 Apparently of Miocene or later age. 



Carinifex (Vortifex*) Tryoxi, Meek. 



Shell depressed subglobose, approaching subdiscoidal, the spire being much 

 depressed. Volutions four and a half to five, increasing rather rapidly in size ; 

 those of the spire slightly convex; last one sometimes becoming a little con- 

 cave on the upper slope near the aperture, and more or less ventricose below, 

 the most prominent part being near the rather small, deep umbilicus, into 

 which it rounds abruptly ; ali rounded on the outer side, and without any 

 traces of carinse or revolving markings. Suture well defined. Aperture 

 rather large, subcircular, its height being to its breadth about as 29 to 34; lip 

 sharp, oblique, and produced forward above, faintly sinuous at the middle of 

 the outer side as well as at the inner side of the base, where it is a little 

 thicker. Surface ornamented with small, distinct, regular ridges, and much 

 finer lines of growth running parallel to the very oblique outline of the lip. 



Height, 0-35 inch ; breadth, 0-64 inch ; height of aperture, 0-29 inch ; 

 breadth of do., 0-34 inch. 



This shell differs from the last, not only in its smaller size, more rounded, 

 less rapidly enlarging whorls, and more prominent spire, but particularly in 

 its very much less excavated umbilical region. It evidently varies consider- 



* I propose the subgeneric name Vortifex for these shells, which differ from the typical 

 forms of Carinifex.

ablj in form and surface markings, some of the specimens being proportion- 

 ally more ventricose, or, in other words, have the body volution, and conse- 

 quently the aperture, higher in proportion to breadth than the others, while 

 more or less difference in the elevation or depression of the spire is observ- 

 able. The most marked differences, however, are to be observed in the char- 

 acter of the surface markings. Generally the little regular costa? parallel to 

 the lines of growth are pretty well defined, but in some cases they fade away 

 so as to be scarcely distinguishable from the fine incremental lines; while in 

 others they are strongly marked, regularly disposed costa?. Sometimes, dif- 

 ferent parts of the surface of the same individual specimen present the varia- 

 tion of sculpturing mentioned. It may be found convenient to designate the 

 more ventricose form as variety ventricosa. 



Named in honor of G. W. Tryon, Jr., of Philadelphia. 



Locality and position. Same as last. 



Carinifex (Tryoni, var.) concava, Meek. 



The only two specimens of this form obtained are considerably smaller than 

 the adult size of the last described species, and differ in having the spire so 

 strongly depressed as to be really concave, and thus to give the entire shell a 

 subplanorbicular outline. Its umbilicus is proportionally of about the same 

 size, as in the C. Tryoni, and its two or three volutions, as in that form, are 

 rounded and without carinae. Its aperture is more nearly circular, being 

 about as wide as high, in consequence of the body volution being proportion- 

 ally less prominent below. Its costa? are very strongly defined and regularly 

 disposed. 



It seems improbable that this can be merely the young of C. Tryoni, because, 

 of some forty odd specimens now before me, not one has the apex or first 

 two volutions concave, though they vary somewhat in prominence in differ- 

 ent individuais. 



Height, 0-18 inch; breadth, 0-30 inch ; height of aperture, 0-18 inch; breadth 

 of do., 0-17 inch, 



Locality and position. Same as foregoing. 



Devonian Species. 

 Spirifer (Trigonotreta) Pinonensis, Meek. 

 Shell attaining about a médium size, somewhat wider than long, varying 

 from transversely subovate to a nearly semicircular general outline ; rather 

 gibbous in adult examples ; cardinal margin nearly or quite equaling the 

 greatest breadth, and terminating in rectangular or rather more obtuse extre- 

 mities ; lateral margins rounding to the front, which is sometimes rounded, 

 sometimes slightly sinuous, or in other examples more prominent and suban- 

 gular in the middle. Ventral valve generally rather more gibbous than the 

 other, its greatest convexity being in the umbonal region, from which it rounds 

 ofF evenly toward the front and lateral margins, as well as to the beak, which 

 projects beyond that of the other valve, and is rather distinctly incurved ; 

 cardinal área of moderate height, narrowed to the lateral extremities, more or 

 less inclined backward, and strongly arched with the beak; foramen having 

 nearly the form of an equilateral triangle, and provided with slightly raised, 

 sharp lateral margins; mesial sinus shallow, rounded, smooth, and of mode- 

 rate breadth narrowed regularly, and well defined to the apex of the 

 beak. Dorsal valve generally more than semicircular, most convex in the 

 central and anterior regions ; beak projecting little beyond the cardinal mar- 

 gin, and with the narrow área incurved; mesial ridge depressed, smooth, 

 and faintly furrowed along the middle, corresponding in outline to the form of 

 the sinus in the other valve. Surface of each valve ornamented by from 

 eleven to about fourteen simple, regular, rounded, radiating plications on each 

 side of the mesial fold and sinus, and also showing, under a magnifier, minute, 

 regular, crowded radiating striee, crossed near the front by stronger undulating 

 lines of growth.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 61 



Length of a médium sized specimen, 092 inch ; breadth of do., 1-20 inch ; 

 convexity, 0-72 inch. 



As nearly as can be determined from a description only, this shell would 

 seem to be closely related to S. macrotkyris, Hall, from the Úpper Helderberg 

 Limestone of New York and Ohio (see lOth Report Regents, p. 133), but differs 

 in being always narrower in proportion to length, never being near " twice as 

 broad as long." Its área also difFers in narrowing regularly to the lateral ex- 

 tremities of the hinge, instead of having parallel margins. On comparison, 

 with good specimens of S. Oiceni, Hall, from the Upper Helderberg Limestone at 

 the falis of the Ohio, which species our shell nearly resembles, it is found to 

 differ in having the beak and área of its ventral valve always more strongly 

 arched. Its área is also proportionally narrower, and its plications larger and 

 less numerous. There are in the collection a large number of well preserved 

 specimens, showingthe characters given to be very constant. 



Locality and position. Pinon Station, Nevada. Devonian, probably of the 

 age of the Upper Helderberg Limestones of New York. 



Lower Silurian Species. 

 Euomphalus (Raphistoma?) rotuliformis, Meek. 



Shell small, sublenticular, or more than twice and a half as wide as high, 

 with the periphery sharply angular, and the much depressed spire a little 

 more prominent than the convexity of the last turn below the angular peri- 

 phery ; umbilicus very wide, deep, and depressed conical ; volutions six or 

 seven, exceedingly narrow, and increasing very gradually in size, ali obliquely 

 flattened, or sometimes slightly concave on the upper slope, which is nearly 

 coincident with that of the spire, and with the under side sloping downward 

 and inward, and nearly one-third wider than the upper surface to the umbili- 

 cus, around which they are rather distinctly angular; aperture obKquely 

 rhombic. Surface unknowu. 



Breadth, 0-32 inch; height, 0-12 inch; breadth of last turn on the upper 

 slope, 0-15 inch ; do. on the under slope, 0-18 inch ; breadth of aperture, 009 

 inch ; height of do., 0-07 inch. 



This species is evidently nearly allied to Euomphalus polygyratus, Roemer, 

 from the Lower Silurian rocks of San Saba, Texas (see Kreid. Von Texas, 

 tab. xi, fig. 4 a, b). It differs, however, in being much smaller, its greatest 

 diameter being less than one-fourth that of Roemer's species, although it 

 shows nearly the same number of volutions. Its volutions are also propor- 

 tionally more convex below, and slope more abruptly into the umbilicus. 



Locality and position. Ridge south of Muddy Creek, Nevada Territory, from 

 a gray subcrystalline limestone of Lower Silurian age, probably of the same 

 horizon as the Calciferous sand rock of the New York series. 



Euomphalus (Raphtstoma?) trochiscus, Meek. 



Shell sublenticular, about twice and a half as wide as high. spire much de- 

 pressed, or but little higher, measuring from the horizon of the sharply angu- 

 lar periphery, than the convexity of the last turn below the same; umbilicus 

 wide, deep and depressed conical ; volutions four and a half to five, increas- 

 ing gradually in size, ali obliquely flattened (or sometimes slightly concave) 

 above, nearly on a line with the slope of the spire, and sloping downward and 

 inward below to the umbilicus, into which the curve is so abrupt as to form 

 an obtuse angle around the same ; aperture wider than high, and rhombic 

 subtrigonal in outline. Surface unknown. 



Breadth, 0-40 inch; height, 0-15 inch; breadth of last turn, 0-12 inch; 

 breadth of umbilicus, about 0-25 inch. 



This is similar in general appearance to the last species, but may be read- 

 ily distinguished by its less numerous whorls, which increase more rapidly in 



1870.]

size. It is much more nearly allied to a form now before me in masses of 

 chert from the west side of Lake Pepin, in Minnesota, found in beds of about 

 the age of the Calciferons Sand rock of the New York series. The latter, 

 however, attains a much larger size, some of the specimens being an inch in 

 diameter, with about six volutions. The Minnesota form is also more sharply 

 angular on the periphery, and has the upper side of the volutions distinctly 

 more concave, and the spire more depressed.* 

 Locality and position, same as last. 



Paradoxides ? Nevadensis, Meek. 



The only specimen of this Trilobite obtained, consists of a natural cast, 

 formed by a moderately thick crust of Arragonite, deposited in a mould or 

 impression of a part of the thorax and the pygidium, with the free borders of 

 the latter broken away. Its rather large size, much depressed form, spinife- 

 rous pleura?, and general physiognomy, as far as seen, at once recall to the 

 mind the well known genus Paradozides. A closer inspection, however, shows 

 its pygidium to be proportionally larger than we see in the known species of 

 that genus, with possibly the exception of P. Forchhameri, of Angelin. 



Of the thorax, eight of the posterior segments are preserved. These show 

 the axial lobe to be much depressed, and about as wide as the lateral ones, 

 exclusive of the free recurved points of the pleura?. The segments of the 

 axial lobe are defined by a broad rounded furrow or depression across the an- 

 terior side of each, and have much the general appearance of those of some 

 species of Paradozides, being a little thickened, squarely truncated, and 

 slightly curved forward at the ends. But they diífer in showing distinct re- 

 mains of a mesial spine or tubercle on each, and in having an obscure, oblique 

 furrow or depression on each side, passing outward and backward from the 

 broad anterior transverse furrow to the posterior lateral angles, so as partly to 

 isolate the slightly thickened and truncated extremities of each. The lateral 

 lobes are nearly flat, and composed of pleura? that extend straight outward at 

 right angles to lhe axis, to their free extremities, which are abruptly con- 

 tracted (almost entirely on the posterior side) into slender, rounded, very 

 sharp spines, which curve backward and outward. Each of the pleura? is also 

 provided with a broad, rather deep, flattened furrow, which commences near 

 the inner end, and extends straight outward for some distance, with parallel 

 sides, but gradually tapers, mainly on the anterior side, to a lanceolate point, 

 before reaching the free extremities. These furrows have not the obliquity 

 usually seen in those of Paradozides, but run parajlel to the direction of the 

 pleura?, so as to leave slender straight ridges, of equal size, along the anterior 

 and posterior margin of each rib. 



The pygidium, exclusive of the portions of the free border broken away, has 

 a nearly semicircular outline, being about twice as wide as long, while it is as 

 much flattened as the thorax. The part remaining equals in length the five 

 thoracic segments next in advance of it. Its mesial lobe is much depressed, 

 and about three-fourths as wide, anteriorly, as the breadth of that of the tho- 

 rax at its widest part seen. Posteriorly it tapers very little, and extends 

 nearly the entire length of the pygidium, as seen with the free border 

 broken away. It is evident, however, that the flattened border projected more 

 or less behind its termination. It shows distinctly five segments, with indica- 

 tions of about two others at the posterior end. The lateral lobes have each 

 three segments, the anterior one being extended out nearly parallel to those of 

 the thorax, while the others are directed more obliquely backward, and rap- 

 idly widen outward. Like the pleura?, they have each a broad flattened fur- 

 row, that of the anterior one being nearly parallel to those of the pleura?, 



* This Minnesota shell probably belongs to an undescribed species, as it has more volu- 

 tions than the form described by Dr. Owen, under thename Stroparollus (Euomphalus) Min- 

 nt.sote.nsU. (See his large Geological Report of 1852, p. 581, pi. 11, fig. 12 and 13.) If so, it 

 might be called Euomphalus Pepinensis.

while those of the other two are directed more obliquely backward, particu- 

 larly the posterior one, which is almost parallel to the longitudinal axis of 

 the body. These furrows are so deep and broad as to give the three segments 

 of each lateral lobe the appearance of six irregular ridges, the irregularity 

 being produced by the posterior two segments instead of passing along the 

 middle of each segment, being curved backward so as to divide these seg* 

 ments very unequally, leaving the anterior part much broadest. No fine sur- 

 face markings are preserved on the specimen. 



Entire length of the imperfect specimen, 2-75 inches, of which remaining 8 

 thoracic segments form 1-70 inch ; breadth of the thorax, exclusive of the 

 free spiniferous ends of the pleura?, 2-05 inches, and including the projecting 

 ends of the pleurae, 2-40 inches; length of what remains of the pygidium, 1-03 

 inch ; breadth of do., about 1-80 inch. Supposing it to be a true Paradox- 

 ides, with not less than sixteen thoracic segments, the entire specimen, when 

 complete, -could not have been far from six inches in length. 



It is possible I should call this species Olenus or Conocoryphe Nevadensis, 

 but its large size seems to be an objection to placing it in any section of either 

 of these genera. In the possession of a node or spine on each of the thoracic 

 segments, as well as in the direction of the posterior segments of the lateral 

 lobes of the pygidium, it agrees with the type of Parabolina, but unfortunately 

 the specimen is not in a condition to show whether or not these segments of 

 the pygidium terminated in produced marginal spines, while the furrows of 

 its pleura have not the obliquity of those seen in that type, but agree more 

 nearly with those of some species of Conocephalites. The comparatively large 

 size of its pygidium, and the nodes or spines on its thoracic segments, as well 

 as the nature of the furrows of the pleuras, are rather against its reference to 

 Paradoxides, and lead me to think that it may belong to an undescribed genus. 



Conocoryphe (Conocephalites) Kingii, Meek. 

 Entire form ovate, and much depressed, with breadth equaling about two- 

 thirds the whole length. Cephalic shield semicircular, or a little wider than 

 long, with the anterior and antero-lateral borders regularly rounded in out- 

 line, and provided with a narrow, slightly defined marginal rim ; posterior 

 margin nearly straight, with the lateral angles terminating in abruptly pointed 

 extremities, so short as scarcely to project as far backward as the posterior 

 margin of the second thoracic segment. Glabella depressed nearly even with 

 the cheeks, about two-thirds as long as the entire head,and between one-third 

 and one-fourth the breadth of the same behind, but narrowing forward to its 

 subtruncated anterior end, and separated from the cheeks on each side and in 

 front by a shallow furrow ; occipital furrow moderately well defined, and con- 

 tinued as rather deep broad furrows along the posterior marginsof the cheeks 

 out nearly to the points where the facial sutures cut the margin ; lateral fur- 

 rows not clearly defined in the specimens, but apparently consisting of four 

 pairs. Facial sutures directed at first, for a short distance, forward from the 

 inner anterior end of each eye, then curving gracefully outward as they ex- 

 tend forward, until near the anterior margin of the head, where they are a 

 little wider apart than the distance between the eyes, but again curving rather 

 abruptly inward, soas to reach the anterior margin nearly on a line with each 

 eye; posteriorly these sutures extend at first outward, nearly at right angles 

 to the longitudinal axis, from the posterior end of each eye, and then curve 

 gracefully backward so as to intersect the posterior margin between one- 

 fourth and one-third the distance from the lateral angles, inward toward the 

 glabella. Eyes rather depressed, slightly arched outward, and separated from 

 each other by a space somewhat less than half the entire breadth of the head, 

 and placed less than their own length in advance of the posterior margin, and 

 about once and a half their length behind the front margin of the head; vis- 

 ual surfaces narrow, and not showing any lenses under a good magnifier.

52, and to its own breadth of 79 to 107, being very slightly wider near the 

 middle than in front, and narrowing posteriorlj, with gently convex lateral 

 margins, from behind the middle to the pygidium. Axial lobe depressed, nar- 

 row, or only about two-thirds the breadth of each lateral lobe at its anterior 

 end, and narrowing regularly with straight sides posteriorly ; segments thir- 

 teen, nearly or quite straight, and each with a small node or prominence at 

 each end.* Lateral lobes depressed or nearly flat ; pleurse almost transverse 

 or arching slightly backward, to near the extremities, which are abruptly 

 pointed; each with a well defined furrow, which commences small near the 

 anterior inner end, and widens and deepens for about half-way out, and then 

 narrows and becomes more shallow, so as to die out before reaching the late- 

 ral extremities. 



Pygidium subsemicircular, being rounded posteriorly, with a narrow, 

 slightly flattened border, and somewhat rounded anterior lateral extremities ; 

 length bearing to that of the thorax the proportions of 30 to 79, and to that 

 of the head of 30 to 52, with a breadth of not quite two-thirds of that of the 

 head ; axial lobe more than two-thirds the length, narrow, depressed, and 

 showing more or less distinctly about five segments; lateral lobes much de- 

 pressed, nearly twice as wide at the anterior end as the middle one, each with 

 about three segments, which curve a little backward and become obsolete be- 

 fore passing upon the narrow smooth border ; segments each pnmded with a 

 comparatively large longitudinal furrow, corresponding to those on the 

 pleurae. 



Entire surface apparently smooth, excepting fine radiating striae on the an- 

 terior and lateral portions of the cephalic shield that are scarcely visible with- 

 out the aid of a magnifier. 



Whole length, 1-60 inch ; breadth of thorax, 1-07 inch ; do. of cephalic 

 shield (somewhat flattened by pressure), about 1-12 inch; length of thorax, 

 70 inch ; do. of pygidium, 0-30 inch ; breadth of do., 0-60 inch. 



Of this fine Trilobite three entire specimens and a part of another were ob- 

 tained. They are, however, ali merely sharply defined natural casts, formed 

 by the deposition of a crust of arragonite in the original moulds left by the 

 fóssil in some kind of a matrix. The specimens were evidently somewhat 

 flattened by pressure before or at the time they left their impressions in the 

 rock. This compression has obscured the lateral furrows of the glabella, but 

 most of the other characters of the upper side of the fóssil are clearly seen, 

 even to the facial sutures, and the faintly marked radiating strise seen around 

 the front and lateral margins of the cheeks. 



The genus Conocephalites (or more properly Conocoryphe,foY a strict applica- 

 tion of the rules of priority would, I should think, require that the latter name 

 should be adopted for the genus to which they were both applied) is so nearly 

 allied to Oknus that it may not be always easy to distinguish the two types 

 without seeing the hypostoma, and hence it is possible that the form under 

 consideration may be more properly an Olenus. As it has more the regular 

 oval outline of the íormer, and less pointed and produced pleura than the lat- 

 ter, while it shows clearly the fine radiating striai around the anterior and 

 lateral margins of the head so often seen in Conocoryphe, it more probably be- 

 longs to that genus. It is worthy of note, however, that ali of the specimens 

 seem to be much more depressed or flattened than any of the species yet de- 

 scribed of that genus, while only one of them shows any traces of the slender 

 ridge usually seen passing from the anterior end of each eye to the front ex- 

 tremity of the glabella, and in this one the ridge is so faintly marked as to 

 leave doubts whether or not it is natural. 



LocalUy and position. Antelope Springs, Dryont Mountains, Nevada. Lower 

 Silurian, and probably, judging from the known position of the genus Conoce- 

 phalites, in the rocks of this country and Europe, from the Primordial zone. 



* In some specimens these nodes seem to be wanting, while in others they do not exist 

 on ali of the segments.

Prof. Leidy exhibited the internai organs of generation of a Hog, which 

 were of an anomalous character, and had been sent to him for exaraination 

 by Dr. S. C. Thornton, of Moorestown, New Jersey. The animal, Dr. Thorn- 

 ton informed him, had been bought for breeding purposes, and from outward 

 appearances was considered as a good sow. The animal was frequently in 

 heat, and as often received the boar. At these periods it would froth at the 

 mouth, and champ in the manner usual under such circumstances in the male. 

 As the animal would not breed, it was fattened up for meat, and when killed, 

 the butcher, surprised at the peculiar appearance of the internai genital organs, 

 sent them to Dr. Thornton. The condition of the externai organs the latter 

 did not ascertain, as thev had not been preserved. 



In the specimen exhibited, the uterus and vagina were about as well devel- 

 oped as ordinarily in the sow, but approaching the usual position of the 

 ovary, the uterine horna abruptly narrowed into an impervious cord extending 

 along the inner edge and included in the peritoneal fold enclosingan epididy- 

 mis. 



A testicle with the epididymis occupied the usual position of an ovary in 

 relation with the uterus. The testicles were equally well developed on both 

 sides, but no traces of ovaries were evident. The bodyof the testicle measured 

 about an inch and a half long, by one and a quarter broad, and one thick. 

 The interior exhibited the ordinary appearance. The well developed epididy- 

 mis terminated in a vas deferens extending along the course of the uterine 

 horns, enclosed in the fold of the broad ligament, to the anterior wall of the 

 vagina, in which it pursue*d its way to the incised extremity of the latter. The 

 vaginal portions of the vasa deferentia were enlarged and provided with late- 

 ral cceca. The epididymis and vas deferens were distended with a milky 

 liquid, but this on examination was found to contain no spermatozoa, only 

 epithelial cells and granular matter.

 if itmigbt have belonged to the same skeleton as the former, together with 

 an astragalus, were found by Prof. Hayden in the pliocene deposit of the Nio- 

 brara River, Nebraska. These bonés indicate a small robust specie3 of Rhino- 

 ceros, not likely to have been the same as the Hyracodon Nebrascensis or the 

 Aceratherium occidmtalis, which belong to the miocene formation of the Mau- 

 vaises Terres. They are too small to have belonged to the Rhinoceros crassus f 

 whose remains were found in association with two of the specimens. Their 

 relation to R. meridianws of Texas, R. hesperius of Califórnia, and R. matutinu* 

 of New Jersey is uncertain.

Prof, Leidt stated that he ha-d recently received for examination several 

 small collections of mammalian remains, from three diíferent localities, which 

 were especially interesting, as indicating faunas and formations similar to 

 those of the Mauvaises Terres of White River, Dakota, and of the Niobrara 

 River, Nebraska. 



[June, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 67 



One of the collections, received from the Sinitbsonian Institution, and ob- 

 tained by Clarence King during the U. S. Geological'Exploration of the 40th 

 parallel, consists of specimens found on Sinker Creek, Idaho. These indicate 

 a later tertiary formation like that of the Niobrara River. Among them are 

 fragments of javvs and teeth of Mastodon mirijicus and of Equus ezcelsus, both of 

 which belong to the Niobrara pliocene fauna. 



A second collection, accompanying the former, consists of specimens ob- 

 tained by Mr. King in Utah. Auaong them are remains of Protohippus perditus, 

 Merychippus mirabilis, and Cosoryx, ali of which belong to the Niobrara pliocene. 



A third collection, received from Prof. H. S. Osborn, of Lafayette College, 

 Easton, Pa., was obtained on John Day's River, Oregon. The fossils indicate 

 a miocene fauna and formation like that of the Mauvaises Terres of White 

 River, Dakota. Among them are remains of Oreodon Culbertioni, and what is 

 suspected to be Stylemys Nebrascensis. 



A fourth collection, received yesterday from the Smithsonian Institution, 

 was obtained by the Rev. Thonias Condon, of Dalles City, Oregon, from the 

 same locality as the latter. It consists of a few specimens, mostly uncharac- 

 teristic fragments, but among them are recognized several which pertain to 

 species of the miocene fauna of the Mauvaises Terres. Small fragments of 

 jaws with portions of molars belong to Oreodon Culbertsoni, though two exhibit 

 slight peculiarities. In an upper molar of one, a small accessory fold projects 

 from the outer concavity of the postero-internal lobe, as in the Deer. In an- 

 other specimen the inner surface of the outer lobe of part of a molar is longi- 

 tudinally rugose. In a third specimen there is no peculiarity. Another small 

 fragment of an upper jaw, with portion of a molar, apparently belongs to 

 Agriochozrus latifrons. The specimens indicated are labelled " John Day's, 

 Oregon." 



Accompanying the last collection there is a portion of the head of a tibia, 

 about the size and form of the corresponding part in a Horse, thorougaly 

 petrified, and marked " Alkali Flats, Oregon." A few àdditional but un- 

 characteristic fragments are marked " Crooked R. D." 



Prof. Leidy further made some remarks on Hadrosaurus and its allies, as 

 follows : In the " Synopsis of the Extinct Batrachia and Reptilia," published 

 August, 1869, Prof. Cope has referred the supposed dinosaur Thespesius to 

 Hadrosaurus, apparently from my not having expressed the distinctive charac- 

 ters of the two genera with sufficient clearness. 



Specimens of teeth of a herbivorous dinosaur, obtained by Dr. Hayden on 

 the Judith River, a tributary of the Upper Missouri, I referred to a relative of 

 the Iguanodon with the name of Trachodon (Pr. A. N. S. 1856, 72; Trans. Am. 

 Phil. Soe. 1859, xi, 140). % 



At the same time several vértebra?, together with an ungual phalanx, col- 

 lected on Grand River, were referred to a geuus with the name of Thespesius 

 (Pr. 1856, 311 ; Trans. Am. Phil. Soe. 1859, xi, 151). 



Subsequently the great part of the skeleton of an Iguanodon-like animal was 

 discovered in the green sand formation of New Jersey, and described by me 

 under the name of Hadrosaurus (Pr. 1858, 215; Cret. Rept. U. S. 1865, 76). 



The teeth of the latter animal are identical in form with the most charac- 

 teristic specimen originally referred to Trachodon, but differ in having the en- 

 ameled border of the crown tuberculate. 



Recently I have regarded Trachodon, as indicated by the teeth, as not dis- 

 tinctive from Hadrosaurus (Pr. 1868, 199). 



From my remarks that " had the remains of Thespesius and Trachodon been 

 found in a depositof the same age I shouli have unhesitatingly referred them 

 to the same animal " (Cret. Rept. 84), Prof. Cope, from a misconception of the 

 meaning, has regarded Thespesius the same as Hadrosaurus. 



The difFerence in character of the corresponding vértebras render the two 

 genera distinct, though, as in a multitude of other instances, they may have 

 possessed teeth nearly alike, or even identical in form and construetion.

The caudal vertebrae of Hadrosaurus are biconcave or amphiccelian ; those 

 of Thespesius, at least the larger, more cbaracteristic ones, are convexo- concave 

 or opisthocoelian. 



In the present condition of knowledge of the remains of Hadrosaurus and 

 its allies, the following appear as distinct : 



HADROSAURUS. 



Caudais biconcave or amphiccelian ; cervicais and dorsais convexo-concave 

 or opisthocoelian. 



Hadrosaurus Foulkii.

Crowns of teeth non-tuberculate at the enameled margins. 



Remarks. — The non-tuberculate character of the borders of the teeth was 

 not unlikely associated witb others in the skull, &c, which if known would 

 probably separate this species as a distinct genus from Hadrosaurus. 



Hadrosaurus tripos. 



Cope : Pr. A. N. S. 1869, 192. 



Founded on several caudais from the cretaceous formation of Sampson Co. f 

 North Carolina. The robust character of the vertebrae, with their strongly 

 developed articular processes íor chevrons, recalls to mind the caudais of 

 Iguanodon, as represented in Tab. xxxvii of Owen's Monograph of the Reptilia 

 of the Cretaceous Formation, published by the Palíeontographical Society. 

 The specimens probably represent a true Iguanodon. 



Hadrosaurus minor. 



Marsh : Pr. A. N. S. 1870, 2. 



Indicated by several vertebrae from the cretaceous green sand of New Jersey. 



THESPESIUS. 

 Caudais convexo-concave or opisthocoelian.

Hadrosaurus (?) occidentalis. Cope: Syn. Ext. Batr. and Rept., Aug., 1869, 

 98. 



It is not improbable that part or the whole of the teeth originally referred 

 to Trachodon mirabilis may belong to this animal. Even if such should prove 

 to be the case, the different character of the vertebrae would render Thespesius 

 quite distinct from Hadrosaurus or Trachodon. 



It is uncertain, nay improbable, that the small caudal, with the plano-con- 

 cave body, represented in figs. 6, 7, pi. 10, of the Trans. Amer. Philos. Soe. 

 1859, should belong to Thespesius occidentalis. 



Prof. Leidy next made some remarks on the family of the Vinegar-eels, the 

 substance.of which was as follows : The number of species and genera of ne- 

 niatoid worms, represented by the Vinegar-eels, and constituting the family 

 Anpuillulidse, is astonishingly great. They are found in multitudes frequently 

 in and about moist decaying and fermenting organic substances. Mr. Bas- 

 tian, of London, a few years since contributed to the 25th volume of the 

 Transactions of the Linnean Society a paper, in which he has given descrip- 

 tions, with characteristic figures, of most of the known species, including 

 about one hundred new ones, which he observes he discovered from a few

limited regions ia England in the course of fifteen months. In seeking for 

 the source of the sruall thread-worm, or Oxyuris vermicularis, which infests 

 man, I have also been led to discover some new species, of which I propose 

 in due time to publish descriptions with drawings. As is commonly the case 

 in organic nature, we find the specific form changing with the change in 

 condition, butthe species are often found to differ where difference in the con- 

 ditions are hardly appreciable. 



Mr. Bastian, in a note to his description of the Vinegar-eel, Anguillula aceti, 

 says he was indebted to Dr. Davaine for the opportunity of examining the 

 animais, and adds that " they are much less frequent than is generally 

 imagined, at ali events in England; and this may be due in great measure to 

 the adulteration of our vinegar with sulphuric acid." It would thus appear 

 that the Anguillula aceti he examined was contained in a specimen of what 

 may be suspected to have been the wine vinegar of France. The cider vinegar 

 so commonly used in this country usually teems with Vinegar-eels. Our 

 cruets, when held up to the light, even to the sharp sight of a naked eye fre- 

 quently exhibit the worms swarming, especially at the border of the surface, 

 as if in search of both air and light. By comparison of our cider Vinegar-eel 

 with Mr. Bastian's description and drawings of the true Anguillula aceti, which 

 I infer to be the wine Vinegar-eel, it appears to belong to a different species. 

 From the descriptions of previous authors of the European Vinegar-eel, I had 

 considered ours as the same. I shall not now give a description of the ani- 

 mal, proposing to do so in future, together with other species. I may say, 

 however, while it has nearly the size and form of the Anguillula aceti, it has the 

 cesophagus of the form in the genus Cephalobus of Bastian.

Prof. Leidy remarked that the two fossils presented this evening by Dr. W. 

 F. McAllister, of Burlington, Kansas, were obtained in that vicinity from 

 gravei, at a depth of thirty feet, in digging a well. One of the specimens con- 

 sists of a plate from a large molar of the American Elephant, Elephas Ameri- 

 canus. The other is the fore part of a ramus of a lower jaw of an Ox, perhaps 

 of a large individual of the Bison Americanus. In comparison with the corres- 

 ponding part of the jaw of the existing animal, the measurements are as 

 follow :

Depth at lowest part ofhiatus 21 " 18 H 



Length of hiatus in advance of molar 52 u 52 u

Prof. Leidy further stated that he had recently received for examiuation a 

 small collection of fossils, through the New York Lyceum of Natural History 

 and the aid of his friend Mr. George N. Lawrence, which belonged to Mr. Wm. 

 Newcomb, of New York. The collection is said to have been brought from 

 the Rocky Mountains, but the exact locality has not yet been ascertained. 

 Most of the fossils consist of fresh-water shells, evidently of tertiary age, but 

 adherent matrix indicates them to have been derived from several different 

 strata. Accorapanying them there are a fevv bonés, of which one is the coro- 

 nary boné, apparently of Equus ezcelsus ; the others mostly pertain to two 

 fishes, a large cyprinoid and a ray. As the living cyprinoids are fresh-water 

 fishes, the assoeiation of the remains of a ray may perhaps indicate that this 

 was also a fresh-water species, though it is not unlikely that it may belong to

a marine formation. The two fishes, apparently extinct species and genera, 

 not previously noticed, are indicated by the remains briefly described as 

 folio ws : 



Oxcobatis pentagonus (Ovkoç, a boss or tumor ; Pxnrtç, a ray). — Founded on 

 a dermal boss, with a peDtagonal outline, the sides of whieh are convex. 

 Under surface strongly convex. Upper surface with five planes sloping from 

 a central suinmit and defined by as many prominent borders. From the sum- 

 mit an oval enameloid areola occupies rather less than half the extent of the 

 upper surface. The areola is shining, nearly smooth, and exhibits concentric 

 lines of structure. The very summit of the boss appears composed of a 

 harder, more translucent substance protruding through the opaque wbite 

 areola. Greater diameter of the boss, 16 lines; shorter diameter, 15 lines; 

 thickness from summit, 8 lines ; greater width of areola, 8 lines ; shorter 

 width, 6 lines. 



Mylocyprinus robustus — Founded on specimens of pharyngeal bonés with 

 teeth. There are eight of them of diíferent sizes, ali imperfect. The largest 

 have been double the size of the sraallest, and perhaps they may have per- 

 tained to several species. They are robust, and indicate a large and powerful 

 fish. They have the general form of the posterior pharyngeals in the carp and 

 other cyprinoids. The posterior ramus is prolonged above in a stout pedicle, 

 with an inner triangular articular surface for attachment to the cranium. Its 

 posterior surface, below the pedicle, is broad, nearly flat, with the outer bor- 

 dei' convex and acute, the inner border concave and sustaining a single row 

 of teeth. 



The anterior ramus is thick, and abruptly narrows forward, but is broken 

 at its fore part in ali the specimens. At the angle of conjunction of the rami 

 the boné is massive, thicker fore and aft than transversely. The outer border 

 of the boné forms two flexures. The antero-external surface is broad, verti- 

 cally concave, transversely convex, in some' cases entire, in others excavated 

 into pits communicating with the bottoms of the teeth or extending through 

 the boné where the latter have been shed. 



The teeth form a single vertical row of four, and are supported on the inner 

 side of the conjunction of the two rami of the pharyngeal boné, projecting a 

 short distance below the levei of the inferior ramus, and extending rather 

 more than half-way up the superior ramus. They have stout bony bases, and 

 are of the true masticatory type. They bear a striking resemblance to human 

 premolar teeth — the largest in size as well as form. They are ali of the same 

 character, or present no variety. They successively increase in size from be- 

 low upward. The crown of the teeth is transversely oval, with a broad tritu- 

 rating surface depressed at the centre. The enameloid structure is evervwhere 

 smooth. 



In ali the specimens the uppermost tooth has been shed and not replaced, 

 its position bting indicated by a large quadrate pit of the pharyngeal, in some 

 specimens extending through the boné. In most of the specimens the teeth 

 are but little or scarcely worn. In one specimen they are half worn away, 

 very obliquely from within, outward and forward. Measurements from several 

 specimens are as follow :

No. 1 appears to be from an old individual ; the teeth have ali been shed or 

 broken away. No. 2 is the most robust specimen. The uppermost tooth has 

 been shed and not replaced. The boné is not excavated in pits beneath the 

 position of the contained teeth. No. 3 has the upper tooth shed and the boné 

 perforated in its position. The lower three teeth are retained, but half worn 

 away. In No. 4 the boné is perforated in the position of the upper shed tooth. 

 In Nos. 5 and 6 the boné is perforated in tne position of the upper shed tooth, 

 and deep pits exist beneath the position of the two teeth below. 



ISince communicating the above, Prof. Hayden presented a specimen of a 

 pharyngeal boné of the same fish from Castle Creek, Idaho.

" Remarks on Huxley's Classiôcation of Birds." By T. Hale 

 Streets.

 Meehan. 



The resignation of Mr. Gilbert Coomb3 as a member was read 

 and accepted. 



Mr. Meehan exhibited some specimens of Rumez oblongifolius, a naturalized 

 Dock from Europe. He said that so far as he could ascertain from European 

 specimens, and the descriptions of Babington, Bromfield and other English 

 botanists, the plant was there hermaphrodite; but here, as correctly stated by 

 Dr. Asa Gray, it was monoeciously polygamous. He thought the fact that 

 plants hermaphrodite in one country becoming unisexual in another, was 

 worthy of more attention by those engaged in the study of the laws of sex 

 than had been given to it. This Rumex did not stand alone; R. crispus and 

 R. patienta exhibited the same thing. Fragaria was another instance well 

 known to horticulturists, although the fact scientifically had not received due 

 weight. The average tendency of the strawberry in Europe was to herma- 

 phrodism, — here to produce pistillate forms. 



He also called attention to the fact that in these American specimens uni- 

 sexuality was in proportion to axial vigor. This law he had already explained 

 in times past to the Academy, and new instances were scarcely necessary. 

 Here, however, the moderately weak plant had more hermaphrodite flowers 

 than the strong one ; and in both classes of specimens the number of male 

 flowers gradually increased with the weakening of the axis, until the ends of 

 the raceme were almost wholly of male flowers. The first flowers on the 

 strong verticels were usually wholly pistillate. 



Prof. Cope inquired whether the facts now noted by Mr. Meehan did not 

 conttict with those he had before brought to the notice of the Academy in 

 coniferous plants ? He understood that in them the female flowers were at 

 the apex of theyoung shoots.and the male flowers in lower and more exterior 

 positions. 



Ma. Meehan replied that the facts were identical in both instances in this, 



1870.] 




72 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



that the female flowers in coniferous plants were borne only on the strong 

 vigorous shoots. These vigorous shoots would ia time be crowded and weak- 

 ened by abade, when they would cease to bear female, and produce male 

 flowers only. 



Prof. Cope suggested that, without reference to the relative vigor of the 

 shoots. the male flower was below, and the female flower above; in these 

 Docks the female flower was below, and the male above. 



Mr. Meehan said he had never placed any value on relative position, nnless 

 relative vigor went with it. In the case of coniferous trees, — Pinus particu- 

 larly, — the male flowers were evidently partially formed the fali beíbre ex- 

 pansion, and at the same time that bud seales were forming, and growth 

 forces nearly at rest for the season. They were still in the weaker position, 

 although appearing at the base. 



Prof. Leidy remarked that the interesting communication of Mr. Meehan 

 had recalled to his mind a result of his experience, which he thought would 

 accord with that of others, — viz. : that species viewed as common to both 

 Europe and America frequently exhibit slight peculiarities, which are dis- 

 tinctive of those of the two countries. It is what might be inferred even if 

 we admit the evolution of existing species from a common remote ancestry. 

 A wide separation, with a considerable lapse of time and a modification of 

 circumstances, are sufficient to account for the slight and acquired differences. 

 Even where differences are not observed in form and structure, they may exist 

 in the habit of the species. Thus the common wolf of Europe and America, 

 viewed by many naturalists as of the same species, differs strikingly in charac- 

 ter in the two countries. In the former it is a more fearless animal, not hesi- 

 tating to attack man ; in the latter, it is said never to attack man. 



At an early period observers saw, or thought they saw, many of the same 

 species of plants and animais indigenous to America that occur in Europe, 

 and hence the common names of European species were applied to those of 

 America. Gradually the list of species common to the two countries was 

 much reduced, and now is comparatively small. 



As might be anticipated, in descending in the scale the species common to 

 the two countries become morefrequent; nevertheless many of these common 

 species exhibit geographical peculiarities, which by some naturalists would be 

 regarded as sufficient to consider them distinct. The singular rotifers Meli- 

 Cfrta ringtns and Limnias ceratophylli are described by European authors as 

 being most generally solitary. Here they frequently occur in compound 

 bunches, up to several dozen in a bunch. Agassiz observes : " In the Ameri- 

 can Hydra, as in the European, there are two types, — the brown and the 

 green. The American green Hydra, unlike the European, has the power of 

 extending its body in a remarkable degree. Our brown Hydra has very short 

 tentaoles, while the European has long ones." Agassiz views the differences 

 mentioned as characteristic of adifference of species, and names the American 

 green Hydra II. gracilis, and the brown one H. cárnea. Ayres indicates a 

 brown Hydra, in Califórnia, which he says differs from the latter "in the same 

 point and to about the same degree as cárnea differs from fusca. 11 He names 

 this one II. tenuis. Whilst ready to admit the existence of the peculiarities in 

 these different Hydrae, I do not feel so ready to regard them as distinctive of 

 species, unless the principie is adopted of viewing each peculiarity in a plant 

 or animal as distinctive of species. I have long been familiar with both green 

 and brown Hydra? in the vicinity of Philadelphia, but I have not been able to 

 satisfy myself that they are distinct from Hydra viridis and II. fusca, two of 

 the four species usually indicated as found in Europe. Our brown Hydra is 

 very common, and may be obtained on the under side of stones in the Dela- 

 ware and Schuylkill, or on the submerged stems of plants. Though ordinarily 

 its arms appear no longer or shorter tban the body, I have seen them elongate 

 after some days of rest in a glass vessel of water to three or four times the 



[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 73 



length of the body, which is about five lines. In one instance I saw a brown 

 Hydra from the Schuylkill, the body of which was five lines in length, elongate 

 its arms to nearly three inches. The green Hydra is found more especially on 

 the under side of floating leaves in quiet ponds. It usually has five arras, 

 though I have observed six, and more rarely seve* ; and this is also the case 

 with the brown Hydra, which sometimes has but four arms. As in H. viridit, 

 the arms of our green Hydra are shorter than the body.

Poof. Leidy exhibited a fóssil, submitted to his examination by the Smith- 

 sonian Institution. It consisted of a much mutilated portion of a ramus of 

 the lower jaw of a large ruminant. The specimen, very friable and encrusted, 

 was found 22 feet below the surface, in clay, on the " bench " or " second 

 bottom " of Boyer River, Harrison Co., Iowa, and was presented to the Smitbs. 

 Inst. by D. R. Witter, of Woodbine, Iowa. Other bonés were discovered in 

 association with the specimen, but crumbled to pieces. 



The jaw fragment was especially interesting, as it is supposed to belong to 

 Ooibos cavi/rons, and is the first specimen of a lower jaw yet discovered which 

 may be attributed to that animal. It contains the last molar tooth nearly en- 

 tire, but much worn. This tooth is constructed after the type of the corres- 

 ponding one in the Sheep, and exhibits no trace of the accessory fold between 

 the anterior and median pairs of lobes such as exists in the Ox, nor of a tuber- 

 cle such as is found in the same position in the Deer. The fore and aft 

 measurement of the crown of the tooth is full two inches; the width at the 

 fore part of the crown is nearly an inch. 



An isolated tooth, a last lower molar which had not yetprotruded from the 

 jaw, from Natchez, Mississippi, preserved in the Museum of the Academy, by 

 comparison with the tooth in the jaw fragment, would appear to belong to the 

 same animal. The specimen is two and a quarter inches long and three- 

 fourths of an inch wide at the fore part, and is two inches in its antero-pos- 

 terior measurement. 



Mr. T. Hale Streets made the following remarks on the cranium of an 

 owl : 



Among the Academy's collection of birds' crania there is one belonging to 

 a species of owl (supposed to be the Nyctale acadica), which presents a very 

 remarkable instance of the want of symmetry in corresponding parts of oppo- 

 site sides. 



In this skull the squamous portion of the temporal boné is thin and scroll- 

 like, and joins the post-frontal plate. What is interesting about it is the man- 

 ner in which this union takes place. On the right side the lower end of the 

 scroll-like squamous boné turns upward and forward, and unites with the 

 post-frontal. On the left side the contrary to this is the case ; the upper ex- 

 tremity of the boné curls over and joins the post-frontal, while the lower ex- 

 tremity is free. 



If there had been but a single specimen of this cranium I would have been 

 led to regard this instance of symmetry as abnormal ; but as the same pecu- 

 liarity of structure is presented by two (these being the only representatives 

 of the species in the collection), it would rather suggest itself as a normal 

 condition, although instances of coincidence of abnormality exist, especially 

 in the lower forms of life.

Prop. Leidy exhibited a fóssil which had been submitted to his examination 

 bj Prof. Hayden, wh o obtained it on the Moreau River, a tributary of the 

 Upper Missouri, and was probably derived from the cretaceous formation. 

 The specimen consists of the body of a vértebra of a saurian, devoid of the 

 neural arch, which was sepárated at the suture. It bears a resemblance to 

 the eorresponding part of Nothosaurus, a saurian of the triassic deposits of 

 Europe. The body is cylindroid, moderately narrowed towards the middle, 

 and has the articular ends slightly concave. The suturai connection of the 

 neural arch, including transverse processes, extends some distance down the 

 sides. The measurements of the specimen are as follow : Length of body in- 

 feriorly, llj lines; superiorly, 1 inch ; depth in front, 11 lines ; width, 10 

 lines. 



The specimen probably indicates a marine saurian allied to Nothosaurus, 

 and from its resemblance, the animal to which it belonged may be named 

 Nothosaurops occiduus.

Descriptions of GRASSHOPPERS, from Colorado. 



BY PROF. CYRUS THOMAS. 



ANABRUS, Hald. 



The characters of this genus were not fully given by Prof. Haldeman when 

 he established it, and those subsequently added by Girard are scarcely suffi- 

 cient to distinguish it from other closely allied genera. Having both sexes of 

 three species, I give the following as the principie characters that distinguish 

 it. 



Gen. Char. Head large, smooth, advanced in front between íhe antennse. 

 Pronotum selliform, extending over the base of the abdómen ; rounded and 

 smooth ; anterior portion of the sides reachiug below the eyes ; posterior 

 margin and angles rounded. Prosternum bidentate; posterior angles of the 

 meso-sternum elevated and acute. Elytra very short, having the form of 

 scales in the males ; covered by the pronotum in the females. Antennge longer 

 than the body, sometimes extending beyond the ovipositor. Eyes ovate. 

 Labrum round. Maxillary palpi twice the length of the labial ; three outer 

 joints nearly equal ; terminal enlarged at the tip. Abdómen stout, moderate 

 length ; the sub-anal plate of the male large, slightly notched at the tip, 

 furnished laterally with filiform appendages which appear to be articulated 

 at the base ; the cerei (or subsituted appendages) sub-cylindrical, enlarged 

 and generally bifurcate at the extremity. Ovipositor long. bent beyond the 

 middle. Cerei, in the female, small, generally hairy. Legs slender ; posterior 

 pair very long, femora enlarged next the body, but slender and straight be- 

 yond the middle, as long as the body (omitting the head) ; posterior tibiae 

 long as the femora, slender; ali the tibiae provided with four rows of spines, 

 the anterior rows often scattered and apparently irregular. A stout denti- 

 culoid process above the anterior coxa. The tarsi broad, soles concave ; 

 third articulation cordate. 



This genus differs so slightly, in description, from Thyreonotus, Serv., that 

 there is scarcely a necessity for its retention. But au examination of the 



[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 75 



species is necessary to decide this point. A. purpurascens, Uhler, must be 

 excluded from this genus, as the prosternum is not spined ; it may belong to 

 Pterolepis, Rambur, but I have seen no species of this genus, and therefore 

 canuot speak positively. 



A. Stevensonii, n. sp. 



Fcmale. Purple, mottled with yellow ; forra and coloring somewhat similar 

 to A. purpurascens, Uhler, but sraaller and slenderer in ali its parts. Face 

 wh i te, the transverse suture below the front fuscus ; tips of the mandibles 

 piceous ; palpi pale, the penultimate joints of the rnaxillary palpi striped with 

 purple above ; antenna? long and slender, reaching nearly to the extreraity of 

 the ovipositor, dusky ; craniura cinereous, with the vertex, and a line extending 

 back from each eye, dull white. Pronotum short, not carinated, a slight 

 transverse incision near the front; the two oblique dorsal impressions very 

 narrow and dark ; surface smooth, lurid ; a large black spot occupying the 

 central portions of the sides behind the transverse incision ; lateral margins 

 broadly and anterior margins narrowly bordered with pale yellow ; posterior 

 angles tipped with piceous-black. Tegmina hid beneath the pronotum. Ab- 

 dómen dull purple, somewhat darker along the sides. Ovipositor slightly 

 curved beyond the middle, piceous at the tip ; cerei slender, hairy. Beneath, 

 dull white. Anterior and middle legs short, femora slender and straigbt ; 

 posterior legs very long and slender, femora and tibiae each the length of the 

 body omitting the head ; ali pale, purplish-yellow ; femora smooth; tibia with 

 spines irregularly placed on the angles, also on the rounded portion, black 

 at the tips. The spine above the anterior coxa pale, slender, and bent 

 abruptly downward. 



Length 1-13 in. ; pronotum -26 in. ; posterior fémur -93 in. ; ovipositor -75. 



Hab. Southern Colorado, on elevated grassy terraces near the mountains ; 

 and the parks. Collected by C. Thomas while accompanying Dr. Hayden's 

 Geological Expedition to Colorado and New México. 



Tt is named in honor of Mr. James Stevenson, a member of the expedition, 

 who has for years accompanied Dr. Hayden in his western explorations, and 

 has been a diligent collector of specimens in ali departments of Natural 

 Historv. 



A. minutus, n. sp. 



Male. Similar in coloring and appearance to the A. Stevensonii. Face 

 mottled with purple ; a dark spot below each eye ; a narrow yellow line 

 running back from the upper corner of the eye; cranium cinereous, head 

 somewhat covered by the pronotum. Pronotum short, rounded, smooth ; 

 transverse incision almost obliterated ; oblique dorsal impressions irregular ; 

 the dorsal portion cinereous ; sides with a triangular black spot, interrupted 

 by light spaces ; broadly margined with dull white ; lateral angles tipped with 

 piceous-black. Tegmina short, extending over the second abdominal seg- 

 ment ; margins pale yellow, central portions brown. Abdómen cinereous, a 

 darker line along the sides ; notch of the sub-anal plate very small ; append- 

 ages small, hairy ; the tip of the last dorsal segment strongly bifid, denticulate. 

 The cerei (I use this term for those appendages supplying the place of cerei) 

 slightly bent, bifurcate. Legs same color as abdómen and cranium ; anterior 

 pair quite short; middle pair a little longer; the posterior pair very long, 

 the fémur marked with a dark line along the upper angle ; tibia slender, 

 spines tipped with brown. Antennse at least twice as long as the body. 



Length -75 in. ; posterior fémur -62 in. ; tegmina beyond the pronotum -1 in. 



Female similar to the male in appearance, coloring and size. Cerei small, 

 hairy. Ovipositor bent, somewhat narrowed in the middle; brown at the tip. 



Length as in the male. Ovipositor -55 in. 



Hab. Same as A. Stevensonii. Some specimens in each of the species have, 

 on the under side of the posterior fémur, about four or five abortive spines,

 short, stout, covered with minute depressed hairs : the plate between them 

 triangular. Prosternum not spined. Anterior tibiae with two spines in front ; 

 medial with two rows on the outside 4 (counting the one at the base) and 2.

Ilab. S. E. Colorado. 



EPHIPPITYTHA, Serv. 



This is given by Serville only as a subgenus of Phaneropiera, but the char- 

 acters which distinguish it from the rest of the Phaneropteres certainly justify 

 me in raising it to a genus. Prothorax selliform, more or less scooped trans- 

 versely, elevated posteriorly. Front tuberculate. 



E. GRACILIPES, nOV. Sp. 



Male. Small, slender, legs very long and delicate. Occiput short, convex, 

 terminating in a triangular tubercle at the vertex, not raised above the first 

 joint of the antennae, nor passing between them ; face vertical, straight, flat; 

 terminating upward just above the central ocellus in a sharp angle ; ocellus 

 situated exactly between the lower borders of the folds around the base of 

 the antennae. Pronotum selliform, sub-cylindrical in front, widened and 

 elevated posteriorly ; a slight transverse indenture each side a little behind 

 the middle ; not carinated, surface smooth, with a very soft velvety appear- 

 ance. Elytra very narrow and straight, passing the abdómen one-third their 

 length ; wings narrow, longer than the elytra. Abdómen sub-cylindrical ; 

 Bub-anal plate notched and bi-spinose ; cerei stout, hairy, curved and mu- 

 cronate ; upper plate semicircular. Prosternum not spined ; meso- and meta- 

 sternum have the posterior angles obliquely raised, obtuse.

 rotund, rather elongate before the e3'es ; face very oblique ; frontal ridge dis- 

 tinct, sides parallel, slightly sulcate ; lateral carina? distinct, obtuse, divergent, 

 reaching the lower corners of the face. Antennae strongly ensiform, trique- 

 trous, reaching to the tip of the pronotum ; situated in deep foveolae under 

 the front of the cone. Pronotum about as long as the head; sides parallel; 

 ali its parts very regular ; tricarinate, carinae not elevated but distinct, ali

I have not seen the male. This species comes near O. mexicana, Sauss, but 

 differs from it in the following respects : The antennae are not rotundate, 

 but sharply triquetrous ; the pronotum is carinate, although the carina? are 

 but raised lines ; and although the posterior lobe is minutely punctured, the 

 pronotum cannot be truly called densely punctate. This species approaches 

 closely to Truxalu.

BRACHYPEPLUS, Charp. 



As Charpentier, at the time he established this genus, failed to give ita 

 characters, and the description of Girard is so short and deficient, I give, from 

 a large number of specimens, what I conceive to be the distinguishing char- 

 acters. 



Gen. Char. Body ver}- robust, acridoid. Occiput broad, eonvex, smooth ; 

 vertexmargined ; frontal ridge broad, short, slightly sulcate, expanding below ; 

 lateral carina3 distinct, with a sulcus behind each ; antennal foveolae deep, 

 oblong; cheeks prominent. Pronotum large, elongate, tricarinate ; carinae 

 distinct, continuous ; widest below, expanding posteriorly, sides straight, 

 chagrined above, sides glabrous ; no transverse incisions on the dorsum ; 

 anterior margin rounded, extending slightly on the head ; posterior margin 

 rotlnd. Elytra and wings rudimentary (in the known species). Legs very 

 robust ; posterior femora long as the abdómen, swollen ; tibise strongly spined 

 neafly the entire length. Antenna? filiform, joints distinct ; long as head and 

 thorax. Sub-anal plate of the male tumid ; cerei very short ; female append- 

 ages stout, broad. 



A well marked and distinct genus. 



B. magnus, Girard. 



This ponderous species is easily recognized by fig. 1, pi. xv, Marcy's Expl. 

 Red River La., but the description is quite deficient ; therefore, to aid future 

 investigations, I give it more minutely.

 its variations from that species added to the fact that it was found at but one 

 point, justify me in describing it as new.

Eemarks on Huxley's Classification of Birds. 

 BY T. HALE STREETS. 



In arranging and classifying the collection of birds' skeletons, crania, and 

 sterna in the possession of the Academy, I was induced to compare some 

 points in their osteology with the statements made by Prof. Huxley in an arti- 

 cle entitled " On the Classification of Birds,'' which appeared in the Proceed- 

 ings of the Zoological Society of London, 1867, Part II. 



In this article Prof. Huxley divides birds principally according to the mod- 

 ifications presented by the bonés forming the roof of the mouth, namely, the 

 palatines, the maxillo-palatine processes, the pterygoids, the basi-pterygoid 

 processes, and the vomer. 



After these the sternum, clavicles, coracoids, and occasionally other points 

 claim attention as affording a basis for the classification. 



He makes three orders. The first contains a single bird. the extinct Archíe- 



[July, 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 85 



opteryx. The second comprises the Struthious, or Ostrich family. The third 

 embraces ali the remaining existing birds. To this last he gives the name 

 Carinatae. 



The Carinatae he subdivides into four sub-orders, namely, the Dromaeog- 

 nathae, which have the Cassowaries as their type ; the Schizognathae, 

 which are " characterized not only by the complete distinctness of the 

 maxillo-palatines from one auother and from the vomer, but by the slender 

 and usually pointed form of the latter boné." The third suborder are the 

 Desnioguathae. In these the maxillo-palatines unite with one another in the 

 median line, thus filling up or bridging over the space which exists as a fis- 

 sure in the Schizognathae. The fourth suborder, the JEgithognathae, " have 

 a palatine structure, which is, in some respects, intermediate between that of 

 the Schizognathous and that of the Desmognathous groups, while in others it 

 is peculiar." 



This introduction was deemed necessary in order to render intelligible the 

 remarks which are to follow. 



Schizognathae. 



This suborder is divided into six groups, named, respectively, the Charadri- 

 omorphae, or Plover-form ; the Geranomorphae, or Crane-form ; the Cecomor- 

 phae, or Gull-form ; the Spheniscomorphae, or Penguin-form ; the Alectoro- 

 morphae, or Cock-forna ; and the Peristeromorphae, or Dove-form. 



In the group Cecomorphae, Mr Huxley states that the " Procellaria gigantea 

 alone has presented basipterygoid processes." He had not been able to ob- 

 serve them in other Procellaridae. I have come to the conclusion, from this 

 statement, that his observations must have been limited to Procellaria gigantea 

 and to the Diomedeinae, else he could not have failed to observe them. The 

 following are the species belonging to the Procellarinae which were examined 

 by me : Procellaria giganjtea, P. glacial is, P. glacialoides, P. Lessonii, P. capensis, 

 P. mollis ; Puffinus tenuirostris, Pu/, fuliginosus, Ptíf. Anglorum ; Prion vittata, 

 and Thalassidroma Leachii. In ali of these the basipterygoid processes were 

 present, and well developed (except in Thalassidroma t where they were rudi- 

 mentary), articulating with the pterygoid bonés. 



From the species examined it will be seen that the possession of these pro- 

 cesses is characteristic of the subfamily. Their presence is the rule rather 

 than the exception. Their absence is rather the exception. This fact is suffi- 

 cient I think to justify a separation of them from the other Cecomorphae, and 

 to make a separate group of them under the name of Nectriomorphae. 



The Nectriomorphae may be looked upon as an intermediate group, con- 

 necting the Cecomorphae (which containsthe Larida?, the Columbidae, the Al- 

 cidae, and the Diomedeinae) and the Charadriomorphae (which contains the 

 Charadriada) and Scolopacidae). 



The presence of the basipterygoid processes allies it with the latter.* Its 

 lamellar and concavo-convex maxillo-palatines is a feature common to both, 

 but more characteristic of the Charadriomorpha?. The absence of the recurved 

 process at the angle of the mandi-ble connects it with the Cecomorphae. 



The vomer in Nectriomorphse diífers from that found in either of the two 

 groups mentioned above. In these latter it is forked posteriorly, and embraces 

 the basisphenoidal rostrum on each side. In most of the Cecomorphae a boat- 

 shaped fossa is left between the divergent posterior ends of the vomer. In 

 Diomedeinae the sides are more or less pressed together, obliterating the fossa. 

 The vomer tapers to a point anteriorly. The upper portion of it is flattened 



* In Gflareota orientàHs the basipterygoid processes are absent. The maxillo-palatines 

 are less lamellar than those found in the other Charadriomorptue. The vomer is cleft 

 posteriorly, but slender and rod-like anteriorly. The angle of the mandible presents the 

 recurved process which ia characteristic of the group. 



This genus is evidently an aberrant form, but in which direction it inclines I am not 

 prepared to say. 



1870.J 




86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



out horizontally, while the lower portion is vertical in direction, and scythe- 

 shaped. This form of the boné may be more or less modified. It is not con- 

 fined altogether to these groups. 



In Nectrioinorphae the sides of the scaphoid fossa are flattened down, and 

 the whole boné is compressed horizontally. It is somewhat tongue-shaped. 



The group Geranomorphas is not so well defined as the Charadriomorphae 

 and CecomorpliEe. It is represented by the Rallidae, by the Psophinas and 

 Gruinae of the family Ardeidae, aud by Otidinae of the Struthionida?. 



The following are the characteristics of the group, as given by Huxley: 



" The rostrum is relatively stronger than in the preceding group (Charadri- 

 omorphae), and may even be short and arched. 



" The basipterygoid "processes are absent (ex. Grus antigoné). 



u The maxillo-palatines are concavo- convex and lamellar. 



" The angle of the mandible is truncated. 



" In the typical groups the sternum is comparatively narrow and elongated. 

 and may be deeply notched or entire." 



In that portion of the article where he considered the cranial characters 

 alone, he states that the Rails are always devoid of basipterygoid processes. 



I found them to exist only in Ortygometra porzana* where they are well de- 

 veloped. 



In addition to the sternal characters mentioned, I may state the following : 

 From the situation of the principal pneumatic foramen on the internai sur- 

 face of the sternum there rises a ridge which is produced upward to the ante- 

 rior border, where it becomes forked or branched, and may present either a 

 Y- or J-shaped appearance. In the former case it looks very much like the 

 bifurcated manubrium of the true Passerine birds. It was present in ali the 

 representatives of this group examined,f except Fulica and Otis. 



In ali of the Rails and in some of the others there is a small process pro- 

 duced upward from the symphysis between the clavfcles. This is a character 

 which is constant in the Herons. Its presence in the Rails shows an inclina- 

 tion towards the Ardeime. 



In Alectoromorpha3,J or Cock-form, "the rostrum may be slender and de- 

 pressed, or high and arched. Oval, flattened basipterygoid facets, sessile upon 

 the basisphenoidal rostrum and articulating with corresponding surfaces upon 

 the pterygoids, are always present. The maxillo-palatines are always lamel- 

 lar, but vary greatly in size, being sometimes very small. 



" The palatine bonés are relatively long and narrow, with obsolete internai 

 lamina? and rounded-off postero-external angles. 



" The angle of the mandible is produced into a strong upcurved process.*' 



In Peristeromorphse, or Dove-form, " the rostrum is swollen at the tip. 

 " The skull is provided with narrow, but prominent, basipterygoid facets." 

 " The maxillo-palatines are elongated and spongy. 

 "The angle of the mandible is not produced and recurved. 

 " The sternum has two posterior notches, the inner pair of which may be 

 converted into foramina." 



Mr. feuxley states that " the Pteroclidas in some respects, but not in cranial 

 characters, approaches the Pigeons." 



Pterocles arenarius I hold to be as much, if not more, Peristeromorphae as 

 Alectoromorphae, in cranial as well as sternal characters.

The basipterygoid processes are situated, like those ia Columbida?, at the 

 juncture of the basisphenoidal rostrum with the body of the sphenoid. As 

 in the Doves, they are prominent and articulate with the pterygoids about 

 midvvay between their anterior and posterior ends ; while in the Alectoromor- 

 pha? they are flattened facets, sessile upon the rostrum, and articulate with 

 the pterygoid bonés near their anterior extremity. The other cranial charac- 

 ters resemble the Cocks. 



The, sternum is almost completely Peristeromorphic. The inner posterior 

 notch on each side is converted into a foram en ; the outer is wide and deep : 

 both of whioli are Dove characters. The anterior inferior angle of the keel is 

 less produced forward. In this particular it is like the walking birds. 



In ali the Gallinaceous birds examined the clavicles presented a large, broad 

 process, which is developed downward from the summit of their symphysis. 

 In the Doves it is wanting, as it also is in Pterocles arenarius. 



On the whole, 1 think that it approaches the Peristeromorphae more closely 

 than the Alectoroinorphae. 



Desmogxath.*:. 



The third suborder, Desmognatha\ is divided into seven groups. They are 

 named the Chenomorphae, or Goose-form ; the Amphimorpha?, a type inter- 

 vening between the Goose and íátork forra ; the Pelargoraorpha?, or Stork- 

 form ; the Dysporomorphre, which have the Gannets as their type : JEtomor- 

 phae, or Eagle-form ; the Psittacomorphae, or Parrot-form : the Coccygomor- 

 phie, or Cuckoo-form ; and the Celeomorphae, or Woodpecker-form. 



In the Chenomorphee "the lachrymal region of the skull is remarkably 

 long. 



"The basisphenoidal rostrum lias oval, sessile, basipterygoid facets. 



" The flat and lamellar maxillo-palatines unite and form a bridge across the 

 palate. 



"The angle of the mandible is greatly produced and recurved. 



"The sternum has a single pair of notches at its truncated posterior mar- 

 gin." 



In this group Prof. Huxley places the Palamedea. The following are the pe- 

 culiarities presented by the bonés situated at the roof of the mouth in Pala- 

 medea comuta. The maxillo-palatines are inflated. They unite with one au- 

 other across the median line ; but this union is not so extensive as that seen 

 in the Anatidae. The bridge across the fissure is very narrow. The maxillo- 

 palatines, anteriorly and posteriorly, are separated by a wide interval. The 

 septum is entirely wanting, as it is in the Gallinaceous birds. Like this 

 group, again, the anterior processes of the*palatines are long and slender, and 

 their posterior ends are rounded off. The posterior extremities of the pala- 

 tines and the anterior extremities of the pterygoids do not articulate directly 

 with the basisphenoidal rostrum, as stated by Huxley. A space, the tenth of 

 an inch, intervenes between the rostrum and the upper surface of the palatines. 

 The basipterygoid processes are long and prominent. 



The lachrymal region of the skull is remarkably short. It presents the 

 same condition in the Gallinae. 



The angle of the mandible is produced and recurved. This character exists 

 as well in the Gallina? as in the Anserine birds. 



The sternum bears no resemblance either to the Gallinaceous birds or to 

 the Anatidae. The externai angles of the posterior extremity are produced 

 more than the middle portion. A slight notch exists on one side. This back- 

 Witnl extensien of the postero-external angles of the sternum is characteristic 

 also of the Albatrosses. 



From the above description it will be seen that the Palamedea comuta exhib- 

 its a decided resemblance to the Gallinaceous form. The closed palate should

not exclude it from the Alectoromorphíe ; for the Cracidae show the same 

 structure in this respect. 



A bird mar present characters which are analagous to thosc found in 

 another bird of a different family without there necessarily being any affinity 

 between them. This is doubtless the case between the Palamedea and Anatidae. 



The following two characters may be added to those already laid 

 down as belonging to the Ardea. They will be found to be highly charae- 

 teristic. 



A rather long and well-developed process is produced upward frora the 

 symphysis between the clavicles. The second peculiarity is in the internai 

 angles of the distai ends of the coracoids. They override one another. 

 This last peculiarity was íirst pointed out to me by Prof. O. C. Marsh, of 

 Yale College. 



In Coccygornorphaj, according to Prof. Huxley, " basipterygoid processes 

 are present only in one genus (Trogon). 



"The maxillo-palatines are usually more or less spongy. The palatines 

 are not developed into vertical plates. but are, as usual, horizontally flat- 

 tened. 



"The sternum usually presents two notches on each side, and has no 

 bifurcated manubrial process (ex. Merops). 



"The clavicles are convex forward, and without any process developed 

 backward from the summit of their symphysis." 



Basipterygoid processes were found in Priotelus temnurus, of the family 

 Trogonidae. They are present in Turacus albocristatus, of the Musophagidse, 

 but here they are rudimentary. They do not articulate with the pterygoids. 



Huxley states that in Merops the "palatines are devoid of any postero-exter- 

 nal elongations. ,; In Merops ceggpticus, M. Leschenaultii and M. amicta the pos- 

 tero-external elongations are quite prominent. 



In Psilopogon pyrolophus and Megalaima chrysopogon, of the family Capito- 

 nid;c, the vomer presents an appearanee which is somewhat singular. It is 

 well developed. Its anterior extremity is bifurcated, and each prong of this 

 forked end is produced to the maxillo-palatine process of the correspond- 

 ing side, and becomes united with it. This form of the vomer is doubtless 

 a family characteristic. 



It was chiefly in the sternal characters that the members of the group 

 Coccygomorphae were found to differ from the statements laid down by 

 Mr. Huxley. 



In ali the members of the family Cuculidae examined,"* the clavicles pre- 

 sented a well-developed process at the summit of their symphysis. The 

 same process was also observed. in Priotelus temnurus. In this bird the 

 manubrial process of the sternum presented a groove on its upper surface, 

 showing a tendency for it to become bifurcated. 



The clavicles may or may not be convex forward. In the Musophagidae 

 (Turacus) and in Bubulus Duvaucelii, the anterior surfaces of the clavicles are 

 straight from above downward. This is an Owl character. The family 

 Musophagidaí is stated by Prof. Huxley as approaching the .Etomorphro. 



In Psilopogon and Megalaima, of the family Capitonidae, and in Ramphastos, 

 the proximal extremities of the clavicles are expanded and T-shaped. This 

 character is common to the Celeomorphae and the true Passeriue birds. Its 

 presence in Capitonidae and Ramphastidíc serves to connect them rather 

 with the Woodpecker th ah with the Passeres. 



The two families under consideration present another character in common. 

 The distai ends of the clavicles are not anchylosed, but are separated by an 

 interval.

 Twelve members present. 



Prof. Leidy exhibited in a vessel of water, numerous living specimens 

 of a leech, which he said was abundant in the vicinity of Pbiladelpbia, 

 but appears to be an nndescribed species. He had firstobserved it in a pond, 

 ou the Delaware, near Beverly, Burlington Co., N". J., from which he obtained 

 the largest specimens. It was found especially beneath half-submerged dead 

 limbs of trees, sometimes between the bark and wood, and in crevices and 

 holes of the latter made by insects. It was also found in the Delaware and 

 Schuylkill rivers near shore, beneath stone3. In ditches below the city, and 

 connnunicating with the rivers mentioned, smaller leech es, apparently the 

 young of the same, were frequent between the leave sheaths of submerged 

 stems of aquatic plants, such as Zhania aquática, Seirpus fluviatilis, Sagittaria, 

 Sparganium, &c. When disturbed, the animal receded from its position of 

 rest, and swam rapidh r like the ordinary medicinal leech, líirudo decora. It 

 appears to belong to a difierent genus from the latter, and approaches most in 

 character Nephelis, though it even exhibits points of difference from this as 

 ordinarily described. The more mature animal from the Beverly pond may 

 thus be characterized : 



Body elongated, flattened cylindroid, narrowing anteriorly, smooth, indis- 

 tinctly annulated, margin acute, above blackish olivaceous, below translucent 

 grayish, with a more or less reddish tinge due to the blood. No síria? or 

 markings visible beneath, and the annuli in this position scarcely perceptible. 

 Annuli about 98, above minutely punctated with yellowish olivaceous or 

 dusky whitish, and narrowly defined by the same hue. Head continous with 

 the body, obtuse. Mouth large, obliquely terminal, subbilabiate ; lower lip 

 crenulate. Jaws three rudimental folds without teeth. (Esophagus capacious, 

 with three longitudinal folds. Intestine simple. Anus dorsal, conspicuous, 

 in the penultimate annulus. Eyes six ; anterior pair largest and approxima- 

 ted : second pair in second annulus corresponding with the lower lip ; third 

 pair smallest, more deeply situated than the others, and placed slightly exter- 

 nai and posterior to the second pair. àcetabulum terminal, inferior, circular, 

 nearly as wide as the body. The larger male aperture conspicuous, and 

 situated about one-íifth of the length of the body from the head ; the smaller 

 female aperture scarcely visible, and situated two or three annuli back of the 

 former. Length to 2 J inches by two lines wide ; .by contraction becoming 

 shorter and wider. 



Smaller specimens, from half an inch to an inch in length, from the ditches 

 communicating with the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, and from the latter, 

 agree in forni and constitution with the preceding, having the same number 

 of annuli to the body, and the same number and disposition of the eyes. The 

 color is translucent pale indian-red, passing into darker shades and without 

 the colored punctaj. Some young pale individuais exhibit a few scattered 

 minute black punctaí down the back, due to single pigment cells, but mostly 

 these are absent. Intermediate sized individuais from the Delaware and 

 Schuylkill exhibit a gradation of character between the two forms indicated. 

 Further, numerous young from the ditches, kept in an aquarium for the last 

 month, have gradually assumed the appearance of the more mature animal as 

 lirst described. 



Nephelis vulgaris of Europe has eight eyes ; and the generative apertures are 

 included between the 34th and 38th annuli. In the species above described I 

 could detect but six eyes, and the annuli at the fore part of the body are too 

 indistinctly defiaed to determine the exact relative position of the generative 

 apertures. 



The new species of Xephelis I would propose to name N. punctata.

I take the present opportunity of observing ifaat yesterday, during a stroll 

 in the meadows below the city, to procure specimens of the leech just de- 

 scribed, I observed that many of the ditches, and several ponds, were teeming 

 with the minute plant Wolffia, probably W. Columbiana, mingled with Lemna 

 polyrrhiza and L.minor. In several places I also observed Slentor polymorphus 

 swarming upon Ceratophyllum demersum, conspicuous by its bright pea-green 

 hue upon the darker hue of the latter plant. In similar positions I also ob- 

 served an abundance of Volvox globator. This latter I have frequently seen in 

 the vicinity of our city, and, preserved in an aquarium, have observed it pass 

 through the various stages representingwhat were formerly viewed as distinct 

 species under the names of V. aureus and V. stellatus. 



In the course of my walk, I.noticed upon the margin ofaditch a large mass 

 of jelly, about two feet in breadth and about two inches in thickness, the 

 character of which I at first did not recognize. It reminded me of the jelly- 

 rish or medusa (Cyanea árctica), so frequently seen stranded on the ocean shore 

 of Xew Jersey. A nearer inspection proved it to be a mass of the remarkable 

 compound ciliated fresh-water polyp, or polyzoon, formerly described by mo 

 under the name of Pectinatella magnifica, which had, by an unusual recedence 

 of the tide, beeu left to die on shore. On examining the ditch in the vicinity, 

 I observed many masses of the same polyp, varying from the size of one's fist 

 to that of a boy's head, mostly attached to the pendent leaves of aquatic 

 plants growing at the margins of the ditch. 



Prof. Copk called attention to a large specimen of a Triyonocephalus., of 

 which some fourteen inches was enclosed in the oesophagus and stomach of a 

 larger Oxyrrhopus plumbeus. The specimens were from theislandof St. Lúcia, 

 W. I. He stated that a species not distantly related to the latter (Ophibolus 

 yelulus) was said to have a similar habit of dcvouring our native Crotalidai. 

 The islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe had become so infested with the 

 fer-de-lance, Trigonocephalus hinceolatus, as to be in parts almost uninhabitable,. 

 and that it was chiefly on account of the danger from this venomous reptile 

 that collecting naturalists had of late years so seldom visited them. The an- 

 nual number of deaths in Martinique from this cause was said to be very large. 

 Some means had been adopted to check the increase of this pest, but with 

 small results. Prof. Cope thought that as the Oxyrrhopus plúmbeas was very 

 numerous in Venezuela and Brazil, and since it was very harmless and easily 

 procured, that its introduction in large numbers into Martinique, etc, would 

 be a simple matter, and one probably to be attended with good results in the 

 diminution, at least, of this enemy of agriculture. 



Mr. Tiiomas Meehax called attention to the arrangements of some plants 

 for preventing fertilization through any other than insect agency. as dis- 

 covered by Darwin. The Salvia family of plants had the most elaborate 

 arrangements for insect agency, but it had been objected to Darwin's theory 

 that insects made no use of them. Bees bored boles through the tube from 

 the outside for the honey, and do not enter by the mouth of the flower, as 

 they ought. In the same way, in the Peíunia, bees bore for honey from the 

 outside. He had discovered that in these cases, where day insects failed to 

 make use of these apparatuses, fertilization was carried on by night moths,so 

 that the objections to Darwinism wefe removed. 



He also referred to the common sweet chestnut, as bearing two classes of 

 male flowers, only one of which probably aided in fertilization. The first 

 class appeared ten days before the other, and are those which give whiteness 

 to the trees. They appear in the axils of the weak shoots. The feraale flowers 

 appear on the ápices of strong shoots. according to his theory of the laws of 

 sex. Thesecond class of male flowers appear at the ends of the vigorous 

 shoots bearing the female flowers. Whatever affects the vigor of the tree in- 

 terferes with toe production of female but not of male flowers, and this was 

 the reason why some seasons had short crops. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 91 



Mr. J. H. Redfibld remarked that, on a recent visit to the northern part of 

 íhe State of XewYork, he had noted the Botrychium lunarioides and Botrychium 

 lanceolatum growing under circumstances that seemed to confirm the idea that 

 these species are really underground parasites, or epiphytic plants. More 

 than tweuty plauts were noticed scattered over a space of a mile in length, 

 and in every instance they were growing near the common blackberry (Rubus 

 villosus), and every plant that was lifted had its roots in contact with the root 

 of the blackberry. He referred to the peculiar character of the root of this 

 genus, — so different from that of other ferns, and so similar to that of some 

 orchids, — and to the fact that these species, so widely distributed, seem no- 

 where abundant, — as favoring the idea of their epiphytic character. Mr. New- 

 man sornq years ago expressed the opinion that the British Botrychium binaria 

 is an underground parasite, but Moore and others have doubted. Mr. R. de- 

 sired to call the attention of botanists to the conditions under which these and 

 other species of Botrychium may be found, with a view to determine the ques- 

 tion.

 ** On some new species of Fishes obtained by Prof. Orton from the 

 Maranon Iiiver, Upper Amazon and Napo Rivers." By Theo. Gill. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan said very little had been written about the causes of 

 those bunches of branches often seen in trees, and called by the people 

 • l crow*s nests," and by botanists fasciations. Dr. Masters,in Teratology, briefly 

 refers to them, and refers to '• over-nutrition " the cause of their existence. 

 He had watched alinost daily the past year one of Abies balsarnca on his owu 

 grounds. The branchlets were weak, the leaves were comparatively long and 

 slender, not distichously arranged, pale in color, deciduous, and many of the 

 branchlets died in the winter. Ali these were evidences of weak nutrition. 



He had found two trees of sassafras, apparently of the same age, growing 

 within a fewyards of each other, but one with numerous fasciculated bunches. 

 In addition to the characters in the other case, here the fasciculated tree was 

 not as large as the other one. 



That weakness, not strength, was the cause, was also proved by facts from 

 an opposite direction, — namely, the law of sex. He had already shown that a 

 low condition of vitality favored male, at the expense of the female organs. 

 He had found a large number of fasciculations in the common blackberry, and 

 in ali ihstances, besides the yellowness and the other marks, there was a ten- 

 dency to abortion in the pistils, an increase in the number of petals, and a 

 development of foliaceous points to the usual calyx segments. So that his 

 law of sex, as well as the usual phenomena of weakened vitality, indicated 

 that it was this and not over-nutrition which caused fasciations in trees.

On favorable report of the Conimittee, the following paper was 

 ordered to be published : 



On some New Species of FISHES obtained by Prof. Orton from the Maranon, 

 or TJpper Amazon, and Napo Kivers. 



BY THEODORE GILL, M. D, PH. D. 



In an expedition to the Andes of Ecquador and Peru, and thence across 

 the continent of South America, under the command of Prof. James Orton, a 

 considerable zoological colleetion was formed, and the fishes being submitted 

 to the writer for determination, the following appeared to be undescribed. Of 

 previously known species, the most noteworthy were Chalcinus nematurw 

 Kner, Gasteropelecus stellatus Kner, Pimeletropis lateralis Gill, and Cyclopium 

 Ilumboldtii Swains. 



Subfamily TETRAGONOPTERIX.E.

[D. 11. A. 34. L. 1. 31. 



The height is contained about twice in the distance between the snout and 

 the median margin of the caudal, and the head about four times in the same, 

 or three and a half in the length, exclusive of the caudal. The profile is con- 

 cave at the parietal region ; the interorbital área is transversely convex. The 

 diameter of the eye is contained two and a half times in the head's length. 

 The supramaxillary extends nearly to the vertical of the anterior margin of the 

 pupil. The dorsal is immediately behind the roots of the ventrals ; its height 

 equals about f of that of the body. The pectoral equals § the length of the 

 head ; the ventrals extend to the anal. 



The scapular spot is indistinct; that at the base of the caudal well defined. 



Most nearly related to T. orbicularis Vai. 



I dedicate this species to Prof. Orton.

The height of the body enters 2f times in the length, exclusive of the cau- 

 dal ; the length of the head 3f ; the profile to the convex snout is rectilinear, 

 and the interorbital space scarcely arched ; the latter is as wide or rather 

 wider than the diameter of the orbit, and about a third of the head's length. 

 The maxillary ceases in front of the vertical of the front of the pupil, and 

 the end of the first suborbital. The dorsal commences considerably behind 

 the origin of the ventrals. The pectorals extpnd beyond the same point, and 

 the ventrals to the anus. The usual silver tinged lateral band, and humeral 

 and caudal spots exist, but are very faint. 



The species is represented by a single specimen, i\ inches long, taken in 

 the river Napo or Maranon and belongs to the same group as A. peruvianus 

 (Tetragonopterus peruvianus M. T.), A. humilis (T. humilis Gthr.), A, scabri-

dal ; the head three and a half times. The eyes are large, the diameter being 

 contained only three and a half times in the length of the head. The supra- 

 maxillary ends under the posterior border of the pupil. The surface of the 

 intermaxillary has four larger equidistant conical teeth, directed forwards, 

 and a smaller one on each side and farther back, between the externai and 

 internai ; the surface of the mandible has also four conical processes. The 

 dorsal commences nearly over the anus ; its height at least equals three fourths 

 of the head's length.* The anal commences nearly under the third dorsal 

 ray. The pectorals extend beyond the anus, and the ventrals, which are 

 inserted nearly midway between the axils of the pectorals and the origin of 

 the anal, extend to about the third ray of the latter. 



The scapular spot is very distinct ; the caudal indistinct. The fins, espe- 

 cially the pectorals, minutely punctuated between the rays. 



I dedicate this specimen to Mr. Philip V. Myers, a travelling companion of 

 Prof. Orton. in compliance with a request of the latter gentleman. 



Hydbolycus Copei, Gill. 

 D. 11. A. 43. 



The height enters 2| times in the length (exclusive of the caudal), the length 

 of the head 3^; the profile between the nape and convex snout is moderately 

 incurved ; the interorbital space is slightly arched, and about equal to the 

 orbit, the snout, and a quarter of the head's length. The maxillary passes 

 considerably behind the vertical of the posterior border of the orbit. The 

 dorsal fin commences above the anus. The pectorals pass for a third of their 

 own length beyond the axillae of the ventrals, and the ventrals extend back- 

 wards to the third or fourth anal ray. 



The lateral spot is faint, and above the lateral line, just in advance of the 

 vertical of the anus. 



Four specimens, the largest of which is four and a quarter inches long, 

 were obtained in the Napo and Maranon rivers. 



I dedicate this species to my esteemed friend, Prof. Cope, in recognition of 

 his important contributions to herpetology and ichthyology. 



Subfamily SERRASALMONIN.E. 



Pygocbntrus altus Gill. 



P. 17. V. 7. D. 17. A. 33. 



The height of the body is contained about 3 4-5ths in the length, exclusive 

 of the caudal ; the length of the head (measured from the prominent lower 

 jaw) about 2|. The back declines very slowly towards the nape of the neck, 

 and thence is boldly decurved downwards. Snout obtuse, less than the diam- 

 eter of the eye. The diameter of the eye equals a fifth of the head's length, 

 and the interorbital width enters 2^ in the same distance. The second sub- 

 orbital boné is separated from the preoperculum by a lunate naked área. 

 There are fourteen teeth in each jaw. The origin of the dorsal fin is nearer 

 the eye than the root of the caudal ; its height is less than half the head's 

 length. The origin of the anal is under the last dorsal rays. The pectorals 

 scarcely reach the bases of the ventrals ; the latter are two thirds as long as the 

 former. Gill-rakers of the outer branchial arch short and pointed like those 

 of the other arches. Abdómen armed with about twenty-seven serratures. 



The color is greyish, iridescent, and tifiged with blueish ; there is no well 

 defined scapular spot, but the region above the operculum is darker. 



Nearly related to P. scapularis (Serrasalmo scapularis Gthr. v. p. 368).

The body is moderalely slender ; the height rather exceeding a fifth of the 

 length (exclusive of the caudal), while the height of the caudal peduncle is 

 about an eleventh. The head forms rather more than a fourth of the length, 

 and is about three fourths as wide as long, or more than twice as wide as the 

 interocular área ; the skin is moderately thick and smooth ; and the supraoc- 

 cipital spine is pointed and extends beyond the vertical of the bony opercular 

 margin. The eyes enter about eight times in the head's length, are entirely 

 in the anterior half of the head, and are about equally distantfrom each other 

 and the middle of the upper javv. The upper jaw projects but little beyond 

 the lower. The intermaxillary band of teeth is widest near the angles, where 

 it is truncated and obtusely angulated, and rather narrowest at the middle ; 

 thegreatest width exceeds a sixth of the length. The intramandibular flaps 

 are considerably wider than the dentigerous bands. The maxillary barbeis 

 extend to or beyond the middle of the ventrals ; the externai mandibular 

 extend beyond, and the internai nearly to, a line with the bases of the pec- 

 torals. 



The dorsal fin is oblong, the longest rays equalling the distance from the 

 second to the axilla. The adipose fin is conlained beíween three andfour times in 

 the length. The pectorals terminate under the second or third dorsal ray, and 

 are not much larger than the ventrals. The porus axillaris is very minute. 



The color is dark brown. The dorsal has the usual broad clear basal band.

The head forms rather more than a third of the length, exclusive of the 

 caudal fin; the outline above is oblong, convex in front; the width is less 

 than half its length, and the width between the orbits less than a third; the 

 hinder margin of the orbit is midway between the snout and opercular flap ; 

 the profile is perfectly straight. The dentigerous área of the upper jaw pro- 

 jects almost entirely beyond the lower jaw, and equals the chin or two diame- 

 ters of the orbit; it is uninterrupted, except behind at the middle, where 

 there is a broad but shallow triangular sinus; the palatal bands externally 

 describe half an ellipse, and are only interrupted at the middle by a linear 

 furrow widening backwards into a hastiform sinus ; tbeir antero-internal an- 

 gles are, however, rounded. The maxillary barbeis extend to the anal; the 

 externai mandibular terminate at some distance from the pectoral fins, and 

 the internai are less than the width of the upper jaw. 



The dorsal spine is unarmed, or scarcely rough behind ; the adipose fin ob- 

 liquely truncated, shorter than the anal and nearly coterminal with it; the 

 pectorals terminate nearly under the last dorsal ray, and in advance of the 

 ventrals, than which they are considerably larger. The caudal is shorter than 

 the head, the lobes are acutely prolonged, and the upper lobe is somewhat 

 larger than the lower. 



The color is ashy with a broad silvery band bounded above by a narrower 

 blackish one, which is bifurcated in front, and below by a still narrower one, 

 or rather a series of partly confluent spots ; numerous spots, generally much 

 smaller than the eyes, cover the entire upper portions of the body and head, 

 as well as the dorsal, adipose, and pectoral fins. 



This species is among those described most closely related to S. Artedii 

 (Platystoma Artedii Gthr. = Mystus No. 6 Artedi), but the length of the bar- 

 beis and coloration at once distinguish it, and still more decided differences

The head is little longer than broad. The diameter of the eye is contained 

 nine or ten times in the head's length. The vomerine teeth are in two oval 

 patches, nearly as large as the eye, and separated by a moderately narrow 

 interval ; the palatine patches are transversely oval, and smaller than the 

 pupil of the eye. The raaxillary barbeis extend beyond the base of the cau- 

 dal ; the externai mandibular beyond the tips of the pectorals, and the inter- 

 nai beyond the bases of those fins. The dorsal fin is three fourths as high as 

 the head is long. The adipose fin is half as long again as the dorsal. 



The ground color is greyish, and íorms meandering lines between the large 

 blackish spots by which it is covered. Ali the fins are similarly colored, but 

 the spots at the base of the dorsal are fused into a band. The barbeis are in- 

 distinctly annulated. 



Closely allied to S. longibarbis (Arius? longibarbis Castlenau), but appears 

 to be distinguished by the longer adipose fin and the number of rays ; it may. 

 however, prove to be only a form of that species. Castelnau has doubtless 

 overlooked the two small áreas of teeth on the palate.

The greatest height enters 4£ times in the length exclusive of the caudal, 

 and 5£ times inclusive thereof. The head enters 4£ times in the length 

 exclusive of the caudal fin. and 5J inclusive of it ; its breadth does not ex- 

 ceed half its length. The gape is continued under the entire eye. The teeth 

 are in a villiform band on the lower as well as upper jaw, and on the vomer. 

 The ventrals are inserted entirely behind the vertical of the dorsal, and are 

 connected together by a membrane which is, however, closely connected with 

 the abdómen along the middle, and is not free even. at the margin ; the extre- 

 mities of the fins extend to or beyond the anus. The barbeis are nearly equal 

 and about two or three times as long as the diameter of the eye. 



The color is greyish, darker above ; the basal half of the dorsal is punctu- 

 lated with black. 



This species is most closely related to Celopsis gobioides Kner, but is distin- 

 guished hy the more compressed head, posterior ventrals, and longer anal.*

The greatest height equals two thirds of the length of the head, which itself 

 enters about 3| times in the total length, exclusive of the caudal. The eyes 

 are moderately large, the diameter equalling a quarter of the head's length. 

 The maxillary barbeis are nearly coterminal with the elongated pectoral fins. 

 The dorsal buckler behind is cordate, and its branches expand inwards and 

 extend as far back as the third soft ray. The height of the dorsal is not much 

 less than the head's length ; its spine is obsoletely serratefl behind. The pec- 

 torals equal nearly a third of the length, and do not reach the ventrals. The

ventrals are inserted midway between the branchial apertures and the base of 

 the caudal. The caudal is forked. 



Color greyish, tinged with silvery on the sides. 



The species is eminently distinguished from its congeners by the forra of 

 the dorsal buckler ; it is most nearly related to C. megalops. 



I dedicate this species to the meritorious ichthyologist and herpetologist 

 Dr. Franz Steindachner, as a slight recognitiou of his labors.

The following paper was presented for publication : 

 "Notice of some CrustaceaDS of the Genus Libinia, with descrip- 

 tions of three new species." By T. Hale Streets. 



Prof. Leidy stated that he had just returned from a short visit to Boston 

 and Cambridge, and that while there he had had the opportunity of examining 

 the collection of Mastodon remains of the Warren museum and the Cambridge 

 University museum, which had so much interested him, that hethought a brief 

 notice of them would be interesting to the members. 



The private museum of the late Dr. Warren, now in possession of his heirs, 

 contains a magnificent skeleton of the American Mastodon [M. americanus), 

 the best preserved and most complete which has yet been found. It was dis- 

 covered in 1845, at Newburgh, N. Y. It is that of a mature male. The jaws 

 contain the last two molars on both sides, besides the tusks above, and one of 

 those below, together with the alveolus of that of the opposite side. This 

 skeleton forms the basis of Warren's book on the Mastodon, published in 

 1852. 



Besides the skeleton indicated, Dr. Warren's museum contains the skull of 

 another, a well preserved specimen, found in Orange Co., N. Y. It is even 

 larger than that of the skeleton, and also pertained to a mature male. The 

 jaws contain on both sides the last two molars; and on one side the fourth 

 molar is also retained. The specimen is described and figured in Warren's 

 book on the Mastodon. (Pis. xvi, xviii, xix.) 



The Warren collection further contains a number of otber remains of Mas- 

 todon, mainly fragments of jaws with teeth, isolated molars, and casts in 

 plaster of others. I may add it also contains a number of molars of the 

 American Elephant [Elephas americanus), together with many vértebra} of the 

 Basilosaurus. 



The museum of the University of Cambridge contains the most interesting 

 series of remains of the American Mastodon which I have yet seen collected 

 together in one place. The most important of tkese are as follow : 



1. A skeleton, discovered, in 1844, in Warren Co., N. J. It pertains to a 

 mature female. The jaws contain the last two molars on both sides, and no 

 traces of inferior tusks remain. 



2. A complete skull of what I take to have been a female approaching 

 maturity. The jaws contain the fourth and fifth molars in functional position. 

 The sixth molar had not protruded and is visible within the jaws. On one 

 side of the lower jaw the third molar is retained but is nearly worn out. On 

 the other side and in the upper jaw the alveoli of the corresponding teeth are 

 partially obliterated. The incisive sockets of the lower jaw are likewise ob- 

 literated. (The specimen is represented in plates v, vi, of Warren's book on 

 the Mastodon.) 



3. Another complete skull of an animal younger than that of the preceding 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 97 



specimen. The jaws contain the third and fourth molars in functional posi- 

 tion. The fifth molar had not protruded and is visible within the jaws. The 

 alveoli of the second molars are partially obliterated, and this is the case 

 also with the inferior incisive alveoli. (Represented in pis. iii, iv, xvii, of 

 Warren's book.) 



4. A lower jaw of a quite young animal. It contains the first, second, and 

 third molars in functional position and but little worn. The crown of the 

 first molar has two transverse divisions ; that of the second, two principal 

 transverse divisions and a less well developed or rudimental third division ; 

 that of the third molar has three divisions. Large sockets for incisive tusks 

 occupy the sides of the symphysis. (The specimen is represented in plate ii 

 of Dr. Warren's work.) 



An examination of many specimens of jaws and teeth of the American 

 Mastodon leads to a confirmation of the view that the dental series consists of 

 an incisive tusk and six molars on each side of both jaws. Whether the 

 usual upper tusks are preceded by a temporary pair has not been determined. 

 Small lower tusks appear to belong to the young of both sexes, but are lost 

 and their alveoli obliterated in the feniale, while one or both are frequently if 

 not usually retained permanently by the male. 



The molar teeth in the order of protrusion successively follow one another 

 from behind, but none of the series of six appear to have vertical successors. 



The young animal exhibits the anterior two and then three molars together 

 with tusks in both jaws, in functional position. As the third and fourth mo- 

 lars assume a functional position the first and second are shed, and as the fifth 

 molar protrudes the third is shed. With the functional existence of the fifth 

 and sixth molars the fourth is shed. Finally, in the old animal the sixth or 

 last molar may alone remain, though usually the fifth and sixth appear to 

 have been retained to the last. 



In the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Haryard College, Prof. Shaler 

 exhibited some Mastodon and other vertebrate remains, the results of his ex- 

 plorations at Big-bone-lick, Ky. Prof. Shaler incidentally informed me that 

 he had detected no evidences of glacial action in the latter region. He sup- 

 poses that the specimens of teeth and tusks, the wearing off at the sides of 

 which I formerly attributed to glacial action, probably had been imbedded in 

 stiff clay in the pathway of Mastodons, to whose tread the wearing was due. 



The collection contained a multitude of remains of the Bison, but these 

 Prof. Shaler found more superficially than those of the Mastodon and Ele- 

 phant, and not associated with them. With the remains of the latter two 

 genera were also found those of Bootherium cavifrons, of which the collection 

 contains a skull without the face. There were also found with these some 

 remains of the Horse, and also the fragment of a lower jaw, which appeared 

 to me to belong to the existing Domestic Hog. 



In referring to Bootherium I may add that I had the opportunity of examin- 

 ing a skull of the recent Musk Õx, preserved in the Museum of the Natural 

 History Society of Boston, the first complete skull of the animal I have ever 

 seen. In this skull I observed that the lachrymal fossa in advance of the or- 

 bit is a shallow depression even less distinct than in the Sheep. In Boothe- 

 rium it is a deep, well defined hemispherical depression, being as diíferent 

 from that of the recent Musk Ox as is that of the Deer. 



In the same museum, besides a few Mastodon remains, I remarked several 

 molars of the American Elephant, interesting from their size. One of them, 

 apparently a last upper molar, is from Brazos R., Texas, and is of the coarse 

 plated variety, corresponding with the Elephas columbi of Falconer. The 

 triturating surface is flat, not terraced, ten inches by four and three quarter 

 inches in extent, including the enveloping cementum, and also fourteen and a 

 half worn lobes or double plates. Behind, are four additional unworn and 

 less well developed lobes. The breadth of the tooth obliquely is thirteen 

 inche3 ; the depth posteriorly to the broken root. eight inches. 



1870.] 




98 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



Another molar is frora St. Mark*s River, Florida. It is an inferior one, and 

 ol' the coarse plated variety. The grinding surface is irregular or terraced, 

 eight and a half inches long, four inches wide ; and it includes eleven lobes 

 or double plates. Five additional unworn lobes succeed. The breadth of the 

 tooth is ten and one-half inches ; its depth to the root, eight inches. 



Taking advantage of my proximity, I went to Amherst, and spent a couple 

 of hours with Prof. C. N. Shepard in examining the Museum of Amherst 

 College. 



Prof. Shepard has recently collected together many interesting fóssil remains 

 of vertebrata. Among these are a multitude of specimens obtained by his 

 son from St. Helena Island, and the famous Ashley River deposits of South 

 Carolina. Those from the latter locality consist mainly of Zeuglodonts, Ceta- 

 ceans and Fishes, but also include remains of Mastodon, the Elephant, and of 

 Equus major and E. fratemus. The St. Helena Island fossils consist of bonés, 

 fragments of jaws and teeth of the Mastodon. Among them were noticed two 

 inferior tusks, which measured about ten inches in length and two inches in 

 diameter at the base. 



The same collection contained a large molar of the American Elephant, of 

 the coarse plated variety, from Califórnia. Some remains of Mastodon from 

 the latter place struck me from their peculiarity, and these Prof. Shepard was 

 so kind as to loan to me for examination and description. 



One of the specimens, which lies on the table, is the fragment of a tusk 

 from " Dry Creek," Stanislaus Co., Califórnia. It indicates a species totally 

 difFereut from the American Mastodon, and in its peculiarities exhibits a re- 

 lationship with the Mastodon angustidens of the middle tertiary period of Eu- 

 rope. The fragment is six inches in length, is slightly curved in two direc- 

 tions, and in transverse section is ovate with the anterior polé acute. The 

 pulp cavity, opening half the diameter at the broken base of the specimen, 

 extends about half its length to the end. The convex side of the tusk pos- 

 sesses, as in Mastodon angustidens, a broad band of enamel, which reaches from 

 the acute edge more than two-thirds the depth of the surface. The enamel is 

 somewhat rugose and is two-thirds of a line thick. At one spot, towards the 

 smaller end of the fragment, it has been irregularly worn through for the ex- 

 tent of about an inch and a half. The opposite side of the specimen, from 

 the acute edge, has been worn off to an extent about equal to two-fifths of the 

 surface. The broken ends of the fragment exhibit very conspicuously the 

 beautiíul arrangement of decussating curved lines so characteristic of the 

 ivory in the tusks of the great proboscidians. 



The vertical diameter of the base of the fragment is 28 lines, the transverse 

 diameter 19 lines ; the vertical diameter at the opposite end is 22 lines, the 

 transverse diameter 16 lines. The entire length of the tusk appears to have 

 been less than two feet. 



The question arises as to what species the tusk fragment shall be attributed. 

 It certainly does not belong to the common American Mastodon, nor is it pro- 

 bable that it belonged to the pliocene Mastodon mirificus. May it probably per- 

 tain to the hardly kno wn Mastodon obscurus ? In the present uncertainty I would 

 look on the specimen as characteristic of a peculiar species, allied to the M. 

 angustidens of Europe. For the name of the species I would propose that of 

 Mastodon Shepardi, in honor of Prof. C. N. Shepard, whose name has so long 

 been identified with the interests of natural history. 



The second specimen, exhibited to the members, consists of a fragment of a 

 lower jaw containing the last molar tooth, and was discovered in Contra Costa 

 county, Califórnia. No information in regard to the age of the deposit, or 

 the character of the locality in which the fóssil was found, accompanies it. 

 The boné is friable, and measures, below the position of the tooth, five and a 

 half inches in depth. Attached to the fóssil there is a portion of soft gray 

 rock, part of the matrix in which it has been imbedded. The tooth is per- 

 fect and well preserved. It has the same general form and constitution as 



[Sept.

the corresponding tooth of the American Mastodon, but is considerably 

 smaller. It bears sufficient resemblance to the plaster cast (represented in 

 fig. 14, pi. xxvii., of " The Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Ne- 

 braska, &c,") of a tooth, the original of which is lost, from a miocene forma- 

 tion of Maryland, to be viewed as pertaining to the same species. This I had 

 named Mastodon obscurus. 



The crown of the tooth consists of four transverse divisions together with 

 the merest trace of a heel. As in the cast of the Maryland tooth, the inner 

 lobes of the crown of the Califórnia tooth are more mammillary, and less 

 angular than in M. Americanus. The outer lobes, likewise as in the Maryland 

 tooth, have better developed oífsets fore and aft internally than in the latter, 

 giving rise to a greater degree of obstruction of the transverse vallies of the 

 crown than in the American Mastodon. The fourth division of the crown is 

 proportionately less well developed, in comparison with those in advance, 

 than in the latter, agreeing also in this respect with the Maryland tooth. The 

 outer lobe of this division is formed of a pair of connate mammillary tuber- 

 cles, as in the latter, but the tubercles are more equally developed. The in- 

 ner lobe is a single mammillary eminence not more than half the elevation 

 of the outer lobe. In the Maryland tooth, the corresponding lobe resembles 

 the outer one, consisting of a connate pair of tubercles as well developed as 

 in the outer lobe. The heel in the Califórnia tooth, as in the Maryland tooth, 

 is formed by a short mammillary eminence occupying the angular space pos- 

 teriorly of the lobes of the fourth division of the crown. A basal ridge 

 is better developed externally in the Califórnia than in the Maryland tooth. __ J

 Maryland tooth, and one of the Mastodon americanus are as folio ws :

It is not improbable that the Califórnia tooth may have pertained to the

 together with the Maryland tooth, and others previously referred to Mastodon 

 obscurus may likewise belong to the same animal. The positive determina- 

 tion of this question must be left for the discovery of additional material to 

 throw light on the relationship of the different specimens which have been 

 thus far presented to our notice.

Prof. Leidy, exhibited the fragment of a jaw of a Crocodile, recently sent 

 to him for examination by Prof. F. V. Hayden, now engaged in geological ex- 

 ploration oí" part of our western territories. The specimen, together with a 

 multitude of small fragments of bonés, scales, and teeth of ganoid and other 

 fishes, was found at the junction of the Big Sandy and Green River. 



The fragment from the fore part of the jaw indicates an animal about the 

 size of the Alligator of the Mississippi, and apparently a head of nearlj the 

 same form. The externai surface of the jaw is exceedingly rough and pitted. 

 Two entire teeth, and the remains of two others are retained in the specimen. 

 The larger of the perfect teeth, apparently, holding the position correspond- 

 ing with a canine, has a blunt conical crown strongly carinated fore and aft, 

 and with the enamel finely rugose. The length of the crown is 8 lines; its diame- 

 ter antero-posteriorly 7£ lines ; and transversely 6£ lines. The specimen per- 

 tains to an extinct species, probably different from any heretofore indicated. 

 The character of the formation from which it was obtained and its geological 

 age I have not learned. 



I propose to dedicate the species to Mr. Henry W. Elliott, a young and able 

 artist, attendant on Prof. Hayden's expedition, with the name of Crocodilus 

 Elliotti. 



Prof. Leidy stated that during the last summer he had made some further 

 observations on Umatella, a genus of ciliated polyps of the family Pedicelli- 

 nidae, discovered by him some years ago (Pr. Ac. Nat. Sc. 1851, 321; 1854, 191) 

 in the Schuylkill River. It is found abundantly below the dam atFairmount, 

 adhering to stones and rocks, on the sides and under part not in contact with 

 the ground. Occasionally it is observed attached to the shell of the living 

 Unio complanatus, and Melania virginica, and less frequently to the stem of 

 Schollera gramínea and the leaves of Vallisneria spiralis. In the locality named, 

 on the rocks, there may be observed, in association with Umatella, the follow- 

 ing animais : Spongilla fragilis ; Limnias ceratophylli, usually abundant and in 

 compound bunches ; Cothurnia pusilla, parasitic on Umatella and Limnias; 

 Hydra cárnea, Ag., Paludicella elongala, Plumatella vesicularis ; and the worm 

 Manayunkia speciosa, etc. 



Unlike the marine genera of Pedicellinidae, the polyp stocks of Umatella 

 are erect or semi-erect, and not prostrate or creeping attached along the sur- 

 face of bodies. Umatella starts by a thin membranous disk or expansion 

 tightly adherent to the point of support. Usually two stems or stocks (occa- 

 sionally three or onlj one,) start from the same disk, and diverge from each 

 other in a gentle curve. The stems may be seen from a simple pedicle with- 

 out division, to a series of eleven divisions or segments, exclusive of the 

 polyp head. A colony of Umatella recalls to mind a miniature patch of 

 plants in a flower garden. The smallest polyps are translucent whitish or 

 nearly colorless ; the largest are less than two lines long, and alternately 

 white and blackish or brownish. When disturbed the polyps retract their 

 arms, hang their heads, and bend downward, so that the heads touch the basis 

 of support, or the stems even become somewhat involute. Voluntarily the 

 polyps are often observed abruptly to move from one side to the other in the 

 most singular manner, as if wearied of remaining too long in the same 'posi- 

 tion. In these movements the stems bend the entire length, but there is no 

 contraction or shortening. In attempting to detach a polyp, the heads sud- 

 denly bend downward in such a manner as if the violence elicited a feelingof 

 pain in the animal. 



The terminal two or three segments of the parent stems usually give off a 

 branch on each side, and this branch sometimes gives off a second. The 

 branches always consist of a pedicle or single joint supporting a polyp head. 



In a polyp stock of more than two divisions, independent of the polyp head, 

 the additional segments are urn shaped. The penultimate segment is barrei 

 shaped ; the last one cylindrical, or clavato, 



The polyp heads are provided with from a dozen to sixteen ciliated arms. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 101 



The internai structure of the polyps including that of the stems, bears a re- 

 semblance to that of Pedicellina, and will be more particularly described in a 

 memoir preparing on the animal. 



The youngest independent polyp stems of Urnatella consist of a simple 

 cylindrical pedicle starting from the disk of attachment to the rock, and sup- 

 porting a single polyp head. The pedicle elongates and divides into two seg- 

 ments. The ultimate segment grows in length and again divides; and in this 

 manner ali the segments are produced. After the production of three seg- 

 ments, the antepenultiinate segment assumes the urn form. Budding com- 

 mences from the second and third segments after their production, and from 

 the succeeding segments, but not usually from the first segment. The buds 

 originate from opposite sides of the base of the segments, and form branches 

 of a single segment with a polyp head. The pedicle of these branches also 

 frequently gives off a bud, which forms a secondary branch of the same kind 

 as the primary ones. 



In the longer Urnatella stocks, branches are usually observed only from the 

 one two or three terminal segments. In the posterior urn-shaped segments, 

 in the position in which branches emanate in the terminal segments, cup- 

 shaped processes are observed. These were formerly mistaken for buds, but 

 «vidently result from the dehiscence or separation of branches, which leave 

 the parent stock to establish colonies elsewhere. Though Ihave not observed 

 this separation take place in Urnatella, yet ali the points of structure appear 

 to indicate that it actually takes place in the manner intimated. 



It thus appears that the first step towards the multiplication of Urnatella 

 is the segmentation of its stem. The segments put forth buds which develop 

 polyps, and these then separate from the parent stock to settle elsewhere, and 

 become the source of other series of polyps. 



The ultimate history of the segmented polyp stock of Urnatella I have not 

 ascertained. The stocks which I have preserved in an aquarium for several 

 months finally lose their terminal polyps. Late in the season, also, ali the 

 polyp stocks which I could obtain on the river shore within the reach of my 

 arm, at low tide, were deprived of their terminal polyps. The destruction of 

 these, however, I have suspected to have been due to their having been un- 

 covered in lower tides earlier in the season. I hope yet to be able to deter- 

 mine this question in the course of the next few weeks. 



It has occurred to me that the segmented stems of Urnatella after the decay 

 of the polyps, remained through the winter with little obvious change, and 

 that in the following season, the segments served as reproductive bodies, in 

 the same manner as the statoblasts in Plumatellidse and their allies. This 

 view is, however, not confirmed by specimens retained in the aquarium, and 

 those collected on the edge of the river which had lost their polyps. 



In relation to the production of ova, or the reproduction of Urnatella 

 through sexual agency I have yet learned nothing. 



Among the animais mentioned, as found in association with Urnatella, is 

 the singular Annelide, Manayunkia speciosa, discovered by me some years ago, 

 (Proc. A. N. S., 1858, 90.) The worm is closely allied to the marine genus 

 Fabricia, and like it, lives in tubes constructed of mud. It is abundant in the 

 locality indicated. Individuais of about two lines in length, are usually seen in 

 a state of division near the middle into two. The anterior division of the body 

 consists of five bristle-bearing annuli in addition to the head. The posterior 

 division consists of six bristle-bearing annuli in addition to the partially de- 

 veloped head. The anterior head is provided with about thirty-six ciliated 

 tentaculi supported on four lobes. It is also furnished with a pair of eyes ; 

 besides which the tentacle-bearing lobes exhibit a number of pigmentary 

 spots, apparently of the nature of eyes. No eyes exist in the tail of Mana- 

 yunkia as they do in Fabricia. The blood is green and is pumped intermit- 

 tently into a large vessel occupying one tentacle on each side of the middle 

 of the head. 



1870.J 




102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



I have studied the development of Manayunkia, which will be fully de- 

 described in a future memoir on the animal. Curiously enough the develop- 

 ment of the young takes place within the tube of the parent, and the young 

 remain in this position for a considerable time after their development. Thus 

 I have obtained the young from the tube of the parent, after it was one-third 

 of a line in length, and consisted of ten annuli, including the head, from 

 which projected ten tentacles. 



Mr. Thomas Mebhan said that last year he had ealled the attention of the 

 Academy to the fact that Gymnocladus and some other plants had a series of 

 buds, not in the usual order of Phyllotazis, aceordant with the leaves, as we 

 have believed axillary buds ought to be ; but in a direct line, one above an- 

 other; and that in these cases the upper bud, the one the farthest removed 

 from the axil, was the strongest bud. He had overlooked the fact long known 

 to botanists, until pointed out by Dr. Engelman, that Lonicera had this longi- 

 tudinal string of buds ; but in this case the largest bud was the one nearest 

 the axil. He had since noted that these buds ali followed the same law in 

 this, that it was the large buds which had a flower-producing character, while 

 the small ones were those which continued the axial growth. 



By the help of this last observation he was now able to explain some facts 

 in Solanaceous plants which he believed had not hitherto been understood. It 

 was T»ell known that many of these had a habit of producing their flower 

 scapes at varying positions between the nodes, and not at the nodes, as is usual 

 with most flowering plants. He exhibited specimens of the common Cherry 

 Tomato, in which a few of the flower clusters sprang apparently opposite to 

 a node, but the majority were at least one-fourth of the way down to the node 

 below ; also other species of the genus, in which the flower peduncle pushed 

 out almost down to the lower axil. This was especially the case in some Egg 

 plants, wherein the leaf axil, the axillary bud, and the bud producing the 

 flower peduncle, were closely together in a direct line, as in Gymnocladus, be- 

 fore noted. The point to which he wished the particular attention of the 

 members was that this internodular flower bud really belonged to the system 

 of buds apparently originating at the node below. 



He then showed that the flowering character of Solanum had a numerical 

 law of its own. Every third node produced a flower spike or cluster. 

 The node next following the flower had barely the rudiment of an axillary 

 bud; the second one bad a stronger bud; the third had a bud which in the 

 Tomato and Eggplant pushed again into axillary growth, and had the extra 

 bud beyond, before noted — the flowering one. Other Solanaceous plants had 

 similar characters, which, unless we remembered what we had learned in 

 these common Solanums, we might not understand. For instance, in Nycte- 

 rium violaceum the two nodes between the flowering one approached very close 

 together, so as to appear nearly opposite, but still one axillary bud stronger 

 than the other. In Datura ali three nodes approached and formed a sort of 

 fascicle with the flower proceeding from the irregular centre of the mass. 



He now exhibited some specimens of the common Poke weed, Phytolacca 

 decandra, and showed that the inflorescence was exactly on the same law. 

 The flower raceme only appeared at every third node, and sometimes was as 

 much as a quarter of an inch above the node. It was directly in a line with 

 the lower bud, as in the cases of Gymnocladus, Lonicera, Solanum, &c, and there 

 was no difficulty in assuming that the flower spike had really belonged to the 

 lower system, just as in the other cases. The ratio of vigor in the axillary 

 buds was just the same. The leaf opposite or near by the raceme had scarcely 

 any axillary bud; the next stronger; the next strong enough to push into a 

 secondary axillary growth ; and then the flower above this. In this we saw 

 Phytolacca to have the same characters as Solanaceous plants. The seeds of 

 Phytolacca were of very similar structure to 'Solanum, and it had many other 

 characters in common. He was not prepared to speak positively without fur- 



[Sept.

ther investigation, but tbought it quite likely, in spite of the hypogynous 

 flower, Phytolacca would be found more nearly related to Solanacece than to 

 Chenopodiacese, near which it was now placed. 



He then exhibited some shoots of Grape Vine, and said that Dr. Engelman 

 had pointed out, when at the Academy last year, that there was some numeri- 

 cal order in the tendrils of grape vines. Id the specimen he exhibited every 

 third node had no tendril ; but he had seen some grape vines in which as 

 many as eight nodes with tendrils had followed one another. In the mature 

 wood, however, those without tendrils perfected the strongest buds. But he 

 had found in the allied genus Ampelopsis a nearly regular system of buds and 

 tendrils. In A. hederacea, the eommon Virgínia or five fingered creeper, the 

 strong shoots running up a wall or tree had at every third node a strong axil- 

 lary bud, without any tendril; while the two intervening nodes had tendrils 

 without axillary buds. Occasionally, but very rarely, two successive nodes 

 would have axillary buds, in which case the lower one would be smaller, and 

 have also a small tendril on the opposite side. Ampelopsis Vietchii had the 

 same character. He had attempted to propagate this by using nodes from 

 which the tendrils pushed, as single bud cuttings, but failed to get any devel- 

 opment from the axils. He believed they had not a trace of a bud in even 

 the most rudimentary state. It had been said in Darwin's paper on motion in 

 tendrils that the gland on the end of the tendril did not develop itself until it 

 approached the object it was to cling to. In Ampelopsis Vietchii, they developed 

 before this, in the shape of small globes, looking like rudiments of the same 

 flower which ultimately appeared. In fact tendrils here were incipient flower 

 branches, as any one could see by tracing the eommon Ampelopsis hederacea up 

 to its final flowering condition, when, the axial growth ending in a terminal 

 bud, instead of the usual lateral tendril, it seemed to erect itself and bear 

 flowers. It would seem as if it was only by the elongation of the axis, demand- 

 ing and drawing to itself nutriment which would otherwise go into the ten- 

 dril, which made it a tendril, and not a flower shoot. 



He did not, however, intend at this time to attempt any explanation of these 

 series of observations. He thought there was nothing in any known law of 

 Phyllotaxis which would explain them ; and that by following them up mat- 

 ters of much interest to botany might be evolved. But, as he might have 

 more to say about it some day, and winter was approaching. he thought to 

 call the attention of the Academy to the facts, so that those interested might 

 examine them for themselves before the frost destroyed the specimens.

 The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair. 

 Twenty-one members present. 



The report of a Committee appointed to draft resolutions regard- 

 ing the death of the late Wm. P. Wilstach was received, and the 

 following Resolutions adopted : 



The death of William P. Wilstach, at Saratoga, Sept. 17, 1870, has been 

 announced to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



Mr. Wilstach during his connection of ten years with this institution has 

 been distinguished among its members by his liberal, intelligent and prompt 

 encouragement of every enterprise calculated to increase and diffuse knowl- 

 edge of the Natural Sciences. Besides many donations at different times, he 

 gave a thousand dollars towards the publication of the last volume of the 

 Academy's Journal ; a thousand dollars to the building fund, and in addition 

 he made a conditional subscription of five thousand dollars to the same fund. 

 These facts are cited in evidence of Mr. Wilstach's interest in the progress of 



1870.]

Notice of some Crustácea of the Genus LIBINIA, with descriptions of four 



new Species. 

 BY T. HALE STREETS. 



Much uncertainty has existed with regard to the identity of certain species 

 belonging to the genus Libinia. Libinia dúbia, ever since it was first estab- 

 lished by Milne Edwards, has been regarded as a doubtful species. In the 

 description of it by Edwards, he states that it resembles L. canaliculata very 

 much, and that it is not improbable that it is the young of that species. " Nat- 

 uralists in this branch of science down to the present time appear to have 

 accepted this statement as the truth. 



De Kay, in his Natural History of New York, states that the u younger indi- 

 viduais, 1 —4 in. in length, are more pyriform in shape, are entirely covered with 

 a dense, downy hair, and the spines are not so prominent as in the adult. In 

 this state I suppose it to be the L. dúbia of Edwards." 



Gibbes in an article in the Proceedings of the American Association for 

 1850, regards the two species as distinct, but says that no absolute characters 

 can be indicated by which they may be separated. 



I do not know how to account for this prevailiug ignorance, as the charac- 

 ters existing, separating the two species, are so plain. 



Libinia dúbia, Edwards. His. Nat. des Crust. vol. 1, p. 300, pi. 14, fig. 2. 



L. distincta, Guerin. 



Besides the characters usually given as distinguishing this species, the fol- 

 lowing may be observed, and they will be found to be highly characteristic. 



In the median line of the body, counting backward from the depression sep- 

 arating the gastric and genital regions, there is a row of four spines ; one on 

 the genital region, two on the cardiac and one on the intestinal. One small 

 spine on the posterior part of the gastric region in the median line, and five 

 arranged transversely on the anterior part of the same region. Three prom- 

 inent spines on the branchial region independently of those on the lateral 

 margin. The hepatic region is usually devoid of spines or tubercles ; sometimes 

 there is a very small, sharp one on each side, or, again, it may be present on 

 one side and absent on the other. There is never more than one on a side. 

 The regions are very distinctly marked out. 



Rostrum prominent. Its bifurcated extremity diverging, and directed near- 

 ly horizontally. The cleft deep. 



[Sept. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 105 



Habitat. Common species of the Southern Atlantic coast. Very common 

 in the Delaware Bay. In the Academy's collection are four specimens from 

 the coast of Long Island ; and one from West Africa, by Duchaillu. 



Libinia canaliculata, Say. Jour. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. 1, p. 77, pi. 4, fig. 1. 



L. emarginata, Leach. 



In the median line of the body, counting backward from the depression sep- 

 arating the storaach from the genital region, there is a row of five spines ; one 

 in the genital region, two in the cardiac and two in the intestinal. On the 

 gastric region there is a longitudinal row of four spines. The second one 

 counting from behind forward is generally double. The anterior one is situ- 

 ated in front of the transverse row, which contains four spines or tubercles, 

 two on each side. The hepatic region always presents more than one spine, 

 usually three, sometimes more ; sometimes three on one side and two on the 

 other. One large spine situated on the posterior part of the branchial region, 

 on a line with the lower spine on the intestinal region, another smaller one 

 intervening between. The whole surface of the carapax studded over with 

 numerous spines and tubercles arranged more or less regularly. The spines 

 on the lateral margin not as prominent as in L. dúbia, but of the same num- 

 ber. 



The cleft of the bifurcated extremity of the rostrum is very shallow. The 

 teeth of the rostrum not on the same plane as in L. dúbia, they present a di- 

 rection downward. In the largest specimens the anterior extremity is consid- 

 erably hooked. 



The characters here enumerated as distinguishing L. canaliculata will be 

 found to hold good through ali variations of size— in those that are no more 

 than an inch in length, as well as in those that are from four to five inches 

 long, the latter being the largest of the kind that I have ever seen. 



Habitat. Common to the North Atlantic coast, but extends down to the West 

 Indies. 



Libixia affinis, Randell. Jour. Acad. Nat. Sc. vol. VIII, p. 107. 



Gibbes says of this species that it " so closely resembles L. dúbia, that if 

 from the Atlantic coast, I should not regard it as diflferent, but as it comes 

 from Upper Califórnia I cannot venture to pronounce it the same." 



The author here quoted undoubtedlymade a mistake when hesaid that L.affinis 

 closely resembles L. dúbia. Stimpson approached the truth more nearly when 

 he stated that "it is very closely allied to L. canaliculata." It is undoubtedly 

 nothing more than the young of canaliculata. That it is so will be evident to 

 any one who will take the trouble to compare them closely. It agrees with 

 L. canaliculata in every respect excepting size. 



Libixia subspinosa, Streets, n. s. 



Carapax pyriforra. Regions distinct. Spines and tubercles few. Three 

 small tubercles arranged transversely on the anterior portion of the gastric 

 region, one on the median line and one on each side. On the posterior part 

 of the stomach, in the usual situation of a spine or tubercle, there is a slight 

 elevation. Genital region compressed from before backward. Two spines on 

 the cardiac region, and one, rather large, on the intestinal region. Five 

 spines on the lateral margin of the branchial region ; the posterior one large. 

 On the upper portion of the same region, near the superior border, are two 

 more, arranged in a line from before backward. Hepatic region devoid of 

 spines, smooth. Just beneath this region, on the antero-lateral border, are 

 two spines, the anterior one large. 



Rostrum prominent; teeth short and their ápices directed forward and 

 toward each other. A short obtuse spine projecting over the inner canthus 

 of the eye. On the inferior border of the orbit are two small tubercles. Ex- 

 ternai antenme cylindrical. 



Anterior pair of feet shorter than the second. The fingers come in contact

along half the extent of their denticulated margins. The second pair of feet 

 about the same length as the carapax, rostrum included. 



The surface covered with close, short hair. Length of the body to the tip 

 of the rostrum one inch and a half. 



Habitat.— Chili. 



(Cabinet Phila. Acad. Nat. Sei.) 



Libinia rhomboidea, Streets, n. s. 



Carapax nearly circular. Regions distinct ; those in the median line of 

 the body fiattened. Six small but sharp spines on the gastric region ; five ar- 

 ranged transversely on the anterior part. The two outer ones and the middle 

 are larger, and are placed in a direct line with one another ; the two inter- 

 vening ones are smaller, and are situated a little in front of the others. One 

 spine situated on the posterior part of the stomach. A.11 the spines on the 

 central regions small. Genital region quadrilateral and bearing a small spine. 

 One on the cardiac region and one on the intestinal. On the posterior part of 

 the cardiac region is an elevation which presents a depression in its summit. 

 Four large and sharp spines on the branchial region independently of those 

 on the lateral margin. These are placed so as to inclose a rhomboidal-shaped 

 figure between them. A prominent spine on the hepatic region ; five on the 

 lateral margin. These with the one on the hepatic region form nearly half a 

 circle. Below the lateral row anteriorly are two prominent spines. 



A prominent spine above the inner canthus of the eye ; a small one at the 

 externai canthus. Externai antennse cylindrical. A spine situated to the 

 outer side of them, and one beneath directed downward. 



Rostrum not so broad as in L. dúbia, and its bifurcation less divergent, the 

 teeth being directed nearly horizontally forward. Anterior pair of feet short 

 and granular; a short spine on the lower portion of the arm. Second pair of 

 feet nearly one and a half times as long as the body. Length of the body 

 three inches and a half. 



Habitat. — East Indies. 



(Cabinet Phila. Acad. Nat. Sei.) 



In the Academy's collection is a single specimen, which very much resem- 

 bles the preceding, and in the absence of any others of the same kind to con- 

 firm the characters, I will not venture to call it a new species. The following 

 are the chief points of difference. The regions in the median line of the body 

 less deprèssed. The transverse row of spines on the anterior portion of the 

 gastric region are arranged somewhat diíferently. The two lateral ones on 

 each side are placed in a direct line, Avhile the middle one is situated a little 

 posteriorly. The bifurcation of the rostrum is more divergent and the teeth 

 are inflated to their tips. Second pair of feet but little longer than the body. 

 Length of the body two inches and four-fifths. 



Habitat. — West Indies. 



If this should prove a new species, I propose for it the name of Libinia in- 

 flata. 



Chionoecetes Chilensis, Streets, n. s. 



Body very much deprèssed, fiattened on top ; nearly as broad as long. Pos- 

 terior border rounded ; broad anteriorly. Anterior and middle portions of 

 the carapax covered with small wart-like prominences, which are deprèssed. 

 These terminate in a more or less well-defined line drawn transversely through 

 the centre of the cardiac region. Ali that portion of the surface not covered 

 with prominences, granular. Regions not very distinct ; gastric region some- 

 what triangular. Externai angle of the orbit projecting. Rostrum very 

 short, and fiattened. Eyes large, of a brown color with black spots. 



Anterior pair of feet but little longer than the body. Internai and externai 

 borders of the under surface of the arm minutely spinous. These as well as 

 the other feet granular. Fingers long and slender, more than half the length

of the whole hand ; denticulated alongthe whole length of their approximated 

 margins. The third article of the second pair of feet flattened ; that of the 

 third pair less so. The same article of the fourth pair nearly cylindrical ; 

 that of the fifth pair cylindrical. This article is long, straight and inflated ; 

 largest diameter in the middle, gradually tapering anteriorly; no enlargement 

 at the nodes. Hair on the body very short, scarcely discernable. Length of 

 body about one inch. 



This species can very readily be distinguished from Peloplastus (Chionoecetes) 

 Pallasii, Gerstaecker. Unlike this the upper surfaces of the tibiae are not cov- 

 ered with short spines, and the double row of granules is wanting on the 

 tarsi. 



C. Ckiletisis rnay be distinguished from C. Behringianus, Stimpson, by the 

 wart-like prominences not increasing in acuteness anteriorly and at the sides, 

 except at the inferior antero-lateral margin. Here, instead of there being 

 fourteen small bifid spines as in C. Behringianus, there are but eleven or twelve ; 

 the first five or six only being of any size. The third articles granular below 

 as well as above. Only the inferior angles of the arms oí the first pair of 

 feet are muricated. 



Habitat.— Chili. 



(Cabinet Phila. Acad. Nat. Sei.) 



Huekia bifurcata, Streets, n. s. 



Carapax smooth, elongated, narrowing in front. Antero-lateral margins 

 acute. On the gastric region three low tubercles arranged in a triangular 

 form with the base of the triangle directed forward. A low tubercle on the 

 cardiac region. The antero-lateral borders produced into sharp processes, di- 

 rected forward, outward and slightly upward from the base of tbe rostrum. 

 Rather broad lateral projections at the junction of the antero-lateral and pos- 

 tero-lateral borders, directed somewhat upward. These projections present 

 two teeth at their extremities, separated by a concave interval. Postero-lat- 

 eral borders rounded. Posterior border projecting backward lip-like, slightly 

 everted on each side. 



Rostrum about two-tenths of an inch in length; bifurcated at its point; 

 flattened horizontally at the anterior extremity, which is on a lower plane 

 than the base. Upper surface covered with hooked hairs. Under surface of 

 the rostrum concave. 



Eyes small, slightly projecting from under the lateral borders of the cara- 

 pax. Externai antennae slender and completely concealed under the anterior 

 prolongatiòn. Basal article cylindrical, slightly clubbed at its anterior ex- 

 tremity ; the second article more than half the length of the first ; the third 

 very delicate. 



Anterior pair of feet about the same length as the carapax. On the distai 

 extremity of the upper surface of the third article is a small tooth directed 

 forward. Second pair of feet longer than the first pair, — about one inch in 

 length. The following feet considerably shorter, and each presents a spine at 

 about the middle of the under surface of the fifth article. Carapax, rostrum 

 included, nine-tenths of an inch in length.

On tho Flowers of ARALIA SPINOSA, L., and HEDERA HELIX, L. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



The study of Aralia spinosa, L., aífords some interesting facts which do not 

 seem to have attracted the attention of other observers.» 



In Dr. Gray's indispensable Manual of Botany, it is said to be "more or 

 less polygamous." I have had many specimens under my daily observation 



1870.] 




108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



this season, from the earliest opening till the last blossom appeared, and find 

 that it is much more nearly moncecious than the above quotation would imply. 

 There are three different sets of flowers corresponding to the thrice com- 

 pounded branchlets of the large panicle. When the fiower scape elongates, it 

 seems suddenly arrested at a given point, and a very strong umbel of female 

 flowers appears at the apex. A great number of secondary branches appear 

 along this main one ; and they also suddenly terminate each with an umbel 

 of female flowers. From these secondary branches a third series appear, and 

 these flowers are well filled with anthers that are abundantly polleniferous. 

 The female organs of these flowers of the third class, are, however, defective, 

 as only a few bear capsules, and in these, a large portion of the seeds have no 

 ovules. The polygamous character is confined to this third series of flower, 

 the first two having purely pistillate blossoms. In these there do not seera 

 to be the rudiments of stamens. 



The most remarkable part of this process of development is, tbat the whole 

 of this first series of female flowers should open so long before the male 

 ones come, that they fali unfertilized. Most part of the second series also 

 fali, and the crop of seeds is mainly made up of a few of the last opening ones 

 of the section, and the comparatively few hermaphrodite ones which are 

 found in those of the third class. It is a matter for curious speculation what 

 special benefit it can be to the plant to spend so much force on the produc- 

 tion of female flowers too early to mature, and then producing such an im- 

 mense mass of pollen to go utterly to waste. 



It may not be amis to note, that in the common carrot the earlier strong 

 umbels have often a male flower in the center ; and that while the usual 

 flowers are of a puré white, this one is of a crimson color. In the central 

 umbels of Aralia spinosa, and at times on spurs along the branchlets of the 

 panicle are similar colored processes, so small that their form cannot be made 

 out by a common pocket lens. Our fellow member, Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt, 

 makes them out, under the dissecting microscope, to be vase-like forms with 

 five minute reflexed segments, and with a small solid disk in the centre. It 

 is interesting as evidently being a successful attempt of an abortive flower 

 to simulate in some respects a real one of another character. 



Examining, also, the flowers of the allied European Evergreen Ivy, Hedera 

 Heliz, L., I find similar laws of distribution of the sexes as in Aralia spinosa, 

 with the addition of a somevvhat different structure in the male from the 

 female flowers. 



In Europe the plant is described as often having a single umbel as a 

 flower spike. It is quite likely in these cases the flowers are hermaphrodite. 

 In ali the cases I have met here, the inflorescence is a compound of several 

 umbels, — a terminal one — female, and the lateral ones male, as in Aralia. 

 But there are rudiments of stamens in the flower, and in occasional instances 

 I find a filament developed ; but never, so far, with any polleniferous anthers, 

 The flowers of the central female umbel have rather longer and stronger 

 pedicels than the lateral male ones. The calyx is united with the ovarium 

 for one-half its length, and the latter much developed in the unopened flower. 

 In the male the segments of the calyx are two-thirds free, and the petals are 

 much longer than in the female flowers. 



As in Aralia spinosa, the male flowers do not open until some time after the 

 female ones ; and not before some of the latter, impatient of delay, have fallen 

 unfertilized. 



I have so often and in so many varied ways demonstrated to the Academy 

 that in plants the male element is a later and inferior creation, that it 

 seems almost superogatory to point out that these plants illustrate the same 

 principie. But it is, part of the record of what I believe to be unobserved 

 facts in relation to these species, therefore I briefly allude to them.

NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHTA. 109 



Oct. 4th. 

 The President, Dr. Euschenberger, in the Chair. 

 Twenty-nine members present. 



Prof. Leidy directed attention to a small collection of fossils recently re- 

 ceived from Prof. F. V. Hayden, now engaged in a geological exploration of 

 part of our western territories. 



Most of the fossils were collected on the Sweet Water R., eighteen miles 

 west of Devil's Gate, Wyoming Territory. 



The most numerous and characteristic remains in the collection are those 

 of a species of Merycochozrus, the skull of which was little more than two- 

 thirds the diameter of that of 3íerycochozrus proprius from the head waters of 

 the Niobrara River. The species is particularly indicated by a number of 

 fragmenta of jaws, with teeth of half a dozen individuais. The anatomical 

 characters are the same as in M. proprius. The infra-orbital arch is of great 

 proportionate depth, as in the latter when compared with its condition in the 

 difFerent species of Oreodon. The face has the same abruptly contracted char- 

 acter in advance of the orbits, and the infra-orbital foramen occupies a cor- 

 responding position as in 31. proprius. In Oreodon the face narrows more grad- 

 ually forward, and has a more triangular outline when viewed from above ; 

 and the infra-orbital foramen is situated farther forward. There may be other 

 important anatomical points distinguishing Merycochozrus from Oreodon, in 

 portions of the skull of the former, which we have not yet had the opportu- 

 nity of examining. 



The inspection of thesespecimens leads me to suspect that the remains from 

 the pliocene sands of the Niobrara River, which I referred to another genus 

 under the name of Merychyus medius, perhaps belong to the same animal, and 

 those from the same locality referred to Merychyus major, perhaps belong to 

 Merycochozrus proprius. The material at command is insufncient for me to de- 

 termine whether this is the case, and under the circumstances I am disposed 

 to refer the remains in question, from the Sweet Water R., to a distinct species 

 with the name of Merycocho3rus rusticus. 



A series of lower molars of this species measures 4 inches. 



A series in another individual 4£ inches. 



The series in M. proprius is 5f inches. 



It has occurred to me that the remains thus referred to a smaller species of 

 Merycochozrus, may have pertained to the female of M. proprius. The speci- 

 mens, however, of ali the individuais, indicate a smaller animal than those 

 upon which the latter was founded. 



In association with the remains are a few fragments indicating a small 

 equine animal, perhaps a Hipparion. There are also several small fragments 

 of jaws indicating the presence of Canis vafer and Merycodus necatus, origi* 

 nally based on specimens from the pliocene sands of the Niobrara River, Ne- 

 braska. 



The remaining fossils consist of two interesting specimens, from near Fort 

 Bridger. One of them is an upper back molar, apparently of a small 

 species of Lophiodon. The crown of the tooth is perfect and but slightly worn 

 at the acute summits of the lobes. The tooth has nearly the íorm, size, and 

 constitution as the corresponding ones in Anchitherium Bairdi, but the ridges 

 extending forward and outward from the inner lobes in advance of the outer 

 lobes exhibit no trace of a disposition to form intervening lobes to the four 

 principal ones. The fore and aft diameter of the specimen is a little over 

 seven lines ; the transverse diameter a little under that measurement. For 

 the name of the species I would propose that of Lophiodon modestus. 



The other specimen consists of a portion of the right ramus of a lower jaw 

 of a small pachydermous animal, containing the true molars, much worn 



1870.] 8 




HO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



together with the mutilated remains of the preceding premolar. The teeth 

 are too much worn to enable me to determine the original anatomical charac- 

 ters, but nevertheless are sufficiently perfect to indicate an animal probably 

 allied to the suilline family. The specimen belongs to a genus and species 

 distinct from any heretofore met with by me from the North American geolo- 

 gical formations, and, so far as I can make the comparison, appears different 

 from any obtained elsewhere. I propose at present to refer it to a species with 

 the name of Hyopsodus paulus, and in future will give a more detailed de- 

 scription of it accompanied with a drawing. 



The length of tbe true molar series in the specimen is half an inch. The 

 last molar is a little over two lines in its fore and aft diameter. The depth of 

 the jaw below the second true molar is three and a half lines.

The following papers were presented for publieation : 

 " Observations on some fishes new to the American Fauna, found 

 at Newport, K. I., by Samuel Powell." By Edward D. Cope. 

 " Note on Silphium laciniatum." By Thos. Meehan. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan said he had noticed a singular habit in the common 

 " Stink bug" of gardens, Reduvius novenarius, Say, which might lead to some 

 important physiological discoveries by those more closely devoted to entomo- 

 logical studies. Wondering what made some abrasion on the bark of a Pinus 

 cembra on his grounds, he was attracted by a female insect of this species 

 nearit; and noticed that on the thigh of the middle leg the usual gray color 

 was of a polished black. Supposing that possibly the insect may have had 

 something to do with the injury to the bark, through which the turpentine 

 was oozing, he waited a few minutes to re-assure the insect — usually timid 

 under observation — that there was no danger. It then went to work to take 

 the turpentine with the heel of the tarsus of the fore leg, and place it on the 

 thigh of the second leg. It took several dozen " heelsful," winding it round 

 the gathering bali on the leg, as one would wind a bali of string. After it had 

 collected together a bali of turpentine about the size of a pin's head, it gently 

 wiped it off with the femora of the hind leg, and applied it to the anus, where 

 it was very rapidly absorbed. It then walked very leisurely to the top of the 

 nearest branch, when it flew away. This was in the end of September. He 

 saw no more of these insects till a week afterwards, when he cut off a small 

 branch on which was another female, and carried it to the pine tree, applying 

 the branch to the stem so that the insect could walk on to it, without much 

 suspicion of human agency in the matter. As soon as it got to the turpentine, 

 it went through the same operation as the other one, taking two doses of it 

 before it walked away ; which it did leisurely, and with much apparent satis- 

 faction. 



Up to this time he had not been able to find a male, so as to ascertain if it 

 also had any similar use for turpentine. 



Thaddeus Norris, after making some observations on a project now on foot 

 for stocking the Delaware river with the black bass of the Potomac (Grystes 

 salmoides), brought originally from the Ohio, mentioned in the same conaec- 

 nection an experiment about to be tried of introducing Salmon by artificial 

 culture. He thought that the Delaware had many characteristics of rivers 

 producing large salmon in Canada, while its summer temperature was scarcely 

 higher ; that it was unobstructed by impassable dams on some of its fine trib-

utaries and on both of its principal branches to their sources. Mr. Norris 

 also remarked that tbe experiment was of mucb iraportance in ascertaining if 

 this valuable fisb — the salmon — may not be gradually acclimated in rivers 

 furtber soutb tban tbose they now frequent.

Prof. Leidy directed attention to a collection of fossils, recently received 

 for examination, tbrougb the Smithsonian Institution, from Rev. Thomas 

 Condon. of Dalles City, Oregon. The fossils consist of remains of mamma- 

 lia, obtained by Mr. Condon from the valley of Bridge Creek, a tributary of 

 John Day's River, Oregon. They appear petrified in the same raanner as the 

 similar remains from the Mauvaises Terres of White River, Dakota, but gene- 

 rally are less well preserved. 



The greater number and more striking specimens belong apparently to a 

 species of Oreodon, larger than any previously discovered and equaling in size 

 Merycochcerus proprius. Indeed, so far as we are familiar with the skull of both, 

 the two are so nearly alike that one may be regarded as only a variety of the 

 other, or at most both may be viewed as distinct species of the same genus. 

 I am, however, disposed to view one as the offspring, by selection, of the 

 other, and regard them as corresponding species of two genera which existed 

 probably in different times or localities. 



The species, which I propose to distinguish under the name of Oreodon 

 superbus, is indicated by a much mutilated skull, together with mutilated 

 crania, and portions of jaws with and without teeth, of half a dozen or more 

 individuais. The specimens indicate a little variation in the size of the ani- 

 mal, but it appears to have been on the average about the same as Meryco- 

 chcerus proprius. 



The forni and constitution of the cranium are the same as in Oreodon Cul- 

 bertsoni, but large inflated ear capsules or tympanic bonés exist as in Oreodon 

 major and O. bullaíus. 



The face is intermediate in character to that of Oreodon major and Meryco- 

 chcerus proprius. It is rather more abruptly narrowed in advance of the orbits 

 than in the former, but not to the same degree as in the latter. The infra- 

 orbital arches are proportionately of much greater depth than in Oreodon ma- 

 jor, and the other species of the Mauvaises Terres of Dakota, but are not so 

 deep as in Merycochcerus proprius. Thus in Oreodon major it measures 9 lines 

 in depth, in O. superbus 18 lines, in Merycochcerus proprius 23 lines. 



The orbits are comparatively small, as in ali the family of the Oreodonts. 

 The lachrymal fossa is proportionately shallower than in O. Culberisoni and 

 O. major, and in this respect is more like that of O. gracilis. 



The infra-orbital foramen in Oreodon superbus holds an intermediate posi- 

 tion to that of Merycochcerus proprius and that of the Mauvaises Terres 

 Oreodons. 



The jaws of O. superbus appear not quite so robust proportionately as in 

 Merycochcerus proprius, and the boné of the lower jaw is of less thickness. 



The teeth of O. superbus and Merycochcerus proprius agree in size and consti- 

 tution, but the premolars and canines of the former appear more compressed 

 laterally, or they are of less thickness from within outwardly, and are some- 

 what wider fore and aft. 



I am prepared to admit that ali the characters by which I have attempted 

 to discriminate different species of Oreodon and Merycochcerus are not fixed, 

 but I nevertheless view them as sufficient to eliminate animais which would 

 be generally recognised as distinct.

112 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE AC ADEM Y OF 



The estimated length of the skull of Oreodon superbus is about fourteen 

 inches. The length of the skull of O. major is about nine inches and one- 

 third. 



In a fragment of a lower jaw of O. superbus, imbedded in the matrix, the 

 crown of the canine is an inch in width fore and aft. The three premolars 

 behind occupy a space of two inches and a third. In Merycochozrus proprius 

 the crown of the lower canine is little more than three-fourths of an inch 

 fore and aft, and the premolars behind occupy a space of less than two 

 inches. 



Of other remains in the Oregon collection there are a few fragments of jaws 

 of Oreodon Culbertsoni, one of which contains a series of the upper last pre- 

 molar and the true molars. There also occur a few small fragments of molar 

 teeth, which are recognizable as pertaining to Agriochcerus antiquus. There is 

 also here an inferior true molar of Leplomeryz Evansi, and likewise there are 

 several mutilated molars of Anchitherium Bairdi. These specimens are ali 

 marked as having been obtained from the " Big-bottom of the John 

 Day." 



An interesting specimen from Bridge Creek consists of a small fragment of 

 an upper jaw, containing two teeth, apparently of a tapiroid animal, and pro- 

 bably the same as that indicated by a tooth from the Mauvaises Terres, and 

 referred to a species with the name of Lophiodon occidentalis. The teeth appear 

 to be the hinder two premolars, or perhaps are the last of these and the next 

 true molar. They are much worn, and the second tooth has its back part 

 broken o ff. They may belong to a different genus from Lophiodon, and they 

 do exhibit slight peeuliarity, but their condition renders a positive determina- 

 tion uncertain. The specimen indicates an animal about the size of the living 

 Tapirus terrestris. 



At least two species of Rhinoceros are indicated by remains from Bridge 

 Creek valley. One of these I think to be the Rhinoceros occidentalis, originally 

 founded on remains from the Mauvaises Terres of White River, Dakota. Sev- 

 eral well preserved upper molars, and a fragment of the lower jaw with an 

 entire molar, marked " John Day's," neither differ in constitution, form or size 

 from those of the last named species. 



An isolated upper molar, marked " Alkali Fiat," clearly belongs to a differ- 

 ent species from the former, and may perhaps pertain to the species Rhinoceros 

 hesperius, founded on the ramus of a lower jaw from Califórnia. From the 

 outer wall of the crown there project into the median valley three folds, and 

 a small fold projects in the vicinity of the latter from the postero-internal 

 lobe. The arrangement of these folds resembles that of a temporary molar 

 from the Niobrara River, of Nebraska (fig. 5, pi. xxiii, Ext. Mam. Fauna of 

 Dakota and Nebraska) referred to Rhinoceros crassus. It is not improbable that 

 the tooth may belong to a peculiar species, but the material thus far brought 

 to our notice is insufficient to determine the question positively. 



Fragments of a canine tooth in the collection indicate apparently a huge 

 species of Elotherium, perhaps the E. saperbum. Another mutilated canine 

 apparently belongs to a smaller species, perhaps the E. ingens. 



Two inferior molars apparently indicate a Peccary about the size of the 

 living Dicotyles torquatus. 



A small fragment of an upper jaw contains a mutilated molar tooth, indi- 

 cating a species of Anchitherium, larger than A. Bairdi, of the Mauvaises 

 Terres of White River. It may perhaps indicate a different though closely 

 allied genus, as the median lobes are proportionately better developed in rela- 

 tion with the inner and outer ones than in the true Anchitherium. The animal 

 would appear to hold a position intermediate to Á. Bairdi and Anchippus texa- 

 nus. Awaiting the opportunity of examining additional material, I would 

 propose for the species the name of Anchitherium Condoni, in honor of the 

 Rev. Thomas Condon, the discoverer of these and the preceding fossils which 

 have been the subjects of examination. The fore and aft diameter of the tooth 



[Oct.

has measured about eight lines, the transverse diameter about three-fourths of 

 an inch. 



Pbof. Leidy further stated that in a recent visit to the Schuylkill river at 

 Fairmount, to seek for specimens of Urnatella, though he had been unsuccess- 

 ful in obtaining living ones witbia reach frora the shore, he had found in the 

 same positions occupied by the former, an abundance of Cordylophora. This 

 is the first time that he had notieed this interesting compound hydroid polyp 

 in the vicinity of Philadelphia, and be -«as surprised that until now it had 

 escaped his notice. Cordylophora was first detected by him in this country at 

 Newport, R. I. He had not been able to satisfy himself that it was a different 

 species from the European Cordylophora lacustris, first described by Prof. All- 

 raan of Edinburgh. It appears, however, to be much smaller. Prof. Allman 

 represents the C. lacusíris several inches in length, with the polyps a line in 

 length. Ours is not more than half the size. As a variety it might be named 

 Cordylophora americana.

Prof. Leidy stated that he had recently received from Prof. Hayden, at the 

 latest date, at Fort Bridger, several boxes of fossils, most of them remains of 

 Crocodiles and Turtles from Church Buttes, the junction of the Big Sandy and 

 Green Rivers, &c. Of these he proposed to give a notice at another period. 

 Among the mammalian remains there were some of special interest, and to 

 these he wished to direct attention at the present time. The first exhibited 

 consisted of the crowns of teeth and fragments of others, of a pachydermous 

 animal, approaching in size the common Ox. Thecrown of a lower true molar 

 resembles in its constitution those of Falteotherium, Chalicotherium and Tita- 

 notherium, being composed of a pair of fore and aft conjoined pyramidal lobes 

 ■with crescentic summits. It measures 16 lines antero-posteriorly and 10 lines 

 transversely. Fragments of upper true molars exhibit the outer part of the 

 crown composed of a pair of lobes exactly as in Hyopotamus. The inner 

 portion of the crown is composed of a pair of simple cones, broad and low, 

 the front one considerably larger than the back one. One of the specimens 

 in the entire condition of the crown measured about 22 lines fore and aft 

 and 18 lines transversely. The crown of an upper premolar has its outer 

 part composed of a pair of conjoined cones with acute summits and sides. 

 The inner portion of the crown consists of a single broad simple cone em- 

 braced in front and behind by a basal ridge. The antero-posterior diameter 

 of the crown externally measures 9J lines ; the transverse diameter is an 

 inch. 



The teeth indicate an animal apparently allied to Chalicotherium and Titano- 

 therium, but different from either. The name of Pal.hosyops paludosos was 

 proposed for it. The remains were obtained at Church Buttes, and belong, 

 as Prof. Hayden reports, to the tertiary formation of the Bridger Group. 



Another fóssil exhibited was discovered by Prof. Hayden at Black ? s Fork. 



It consists of a fragment of the lower jaw, containing two teeth, of an ani- 

 mal about as big as a Rabbit. The teeth, consisting of the two last molars, 

 resemble in their construction those of the Peccary, but the constituent lobes 

 of the crown are more pointed and smoother. The second true molar has four 

 lobes ; the last, an additional lobe. The two teeth together occupy a space of 

 less than 5 lines ; the depth of the jaw beneath the tenultimate molar is three 

 lines. For the animal, the name of Microsus cuspidatus was proposed. 



Another fóssil consists of the greater part of the rightramus of a lower jaw 

 partially imbedded in sandstone, and was also obtained by Prof. Hayden at 



1870.]

Black's Fork. The specimen apparently indicates an animal allied to the 

 Kaccoon, than which it was nearly a third smaller in size. The ramus con- 

 tained a series of seven molars, immediately succeeding the canine, without 

 hiatus. Ali the molars remain except the first, and this like the succeeding 

 one was inserted by a pair of fangs. 



The teeth in the specimen are much worn, so that their original character 

 is obscure. The crowns of the premolars appear to have been nearly like 

 those of the Raccoon. In the true molars the postero-internal cusp of the 

 crown existing in the latter, appears to have been but feebly developed in the 

 extinct animal. 



The body of the jaw, though much shorter, is absolutely deeper than in the 

 Raccoon. The coronoid process has been comparatively narrow ; the exter- 

 nai masseteric fossa feeble, and the condyle is remarkably small, not being 

 more than a third in size of that of the Raccoon. 



The measurements of the specimen are as follow : length from symphysis 

 to back of condyle, 2 J inches ; space occupied by the series of seven molars, 

 16 lines ; depth of lower jaw below the first true molar, 6 lines. 



For the animal the name of Notharctus tenebrosus was proposed. 



Remains of Palceosyops paludosus, have since been received from Henry's 

 Fork of Green River, Wyoming.

On the Stipules of Magnólia and Liriodendron. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



An examination of the stipules of Magnólia afford some highly interesting 

 facts ; most, or perhaps ali of which are known to leading botanists, but 

 which do not appear to be as generally known as they deserve to be ; and 

 which facts may have a more intimate bearing on many of the questions con- 

 nected with the laws of development than is suspected. 



In most species of Magnólia a scar peculiar to the genus exists on the petiole. 

 This scar is elevated somewhat above the surrounding tissue, as if the matter 

 forming it had been laid on the surface after the rest of the petiole had been 

 formed. The tint of green is Dot the same as the rest of the petiole, but it is 

 always of the same tint as that of the leaf blade. In Magnólia macrophylla the 

 petiole and under surface of the leaf is gray ; the leaf blade is pale green on 

 the upper surface. The surface of the scar is pale green, corresponding to the 

 surface of the leaf blade. The whole appearance of the scar is such as if a 

 portion of a leaf blade had been grafted by its under surface on the petiole. 



On the upper point of the scar next the leaf blade are two small articulation 

 points, where the membranaceous stipules finally parted from the leaf. Exani- 

 iningaleaf before these stipules have fallen, the main veins forming the ske- 

 leton'of the stipules are found connecting with these articuli, and, spreading 

 out, diverge downward toward the base of the leaf. In separating at maturity 

 from the petiole, they part first from the base, and last from their place of ar- 

 ticulation. Their weakest hold is the point farthest away from what thus ap- 

 pears to be their source at tbe apex of the scar. 



Magnólia Frazeri elongates its petiole beyond the stipule several inches gen- 

 erally. The leaf blade then exhibits the auricle so well known in this species. 

 The structure of this auricle is similar to the stipules in M. macrophylla or M. 

 tripetela. The veins start out in nearly as close a fascicle as in these stipules, 



[Oct. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 



115 



and they diverge and curve downwards just as these stipules do. Abolre these 

 strong veins of the auricle are very weak veins, necessitating a very narrow 

 blade portion there, until another set of strong veins push out and make the 

 main part of the lamina. 



If we press these auricles back against the petiole, and imagine an union 

 with it, then a separation from the main leaf blade, and an union of the edges 

 of the separated auricle, both above and below, we have a sheathed stipule 

 exactly as we find them, and we see how easily Magnólia Frazeri might be a 

 pinnate leaf of five leaflets on the supposition that the stipular portions really 

 have taken the course we suppose these auricles might take. 



I suppose no one of experience in living plants doubts the possibility of the 

 adheaion of some parts and the separation of others, so as to make new parts 

 or^organs. If such is desired, I would refer to the adhesion of the carpellary 

 leaves by their backs in the capsules of Staphylea trifolia ; and for separation 

 to the pinnate leaf often formed out of an entire blade in Fraxinus ezcelsior, 

 heterophylla, and many other plants with entire leaves which often have pin- 

 nate ones amongst them. 



It is scarcely possible, with these facts before us, to avoid the suspicion that 

 the stipules of Magnólia are not formed like the stipules of most plants, which 

 are perhaps leaf portions which have never been well developed, but rather are 

 the tolerably well developed side pinnules of a trifoliate or deeply auricled 

 leaf, which in an early stage had adnated with the petiole, and by their edges, 

 and thus formed the stipular sheath we see. The suppositious case I have 

 drawn from the auricles of M. Frazeri is still bctter illustrated by leaves of 

 some Ranunculaceous plants. For instance, Anemone Pennsylvanica. Lay the 

 lower lobes flat against the petiole, imagine the adnation by their backs, and 

 cohesion of the edges, and we have the idea clearly. 



It is difncult to conceive that these stipular sheathes could have been formed 

 in harmony with ali the appearances we have detailed, in any other way ; but 

 ideas and possibilities are not as good as direct facts. These are furnished 

 in good part in other ways. 



In the East Indian species, M. fuscata, the flowers are axillary, not terminal 

 as in most other species. Three of the leaf axils on the growth of last year pro- 

 duce flowers. The lowest flower is the weakest, the upper the strongest. The 

 bracts which enfold the flower buds are of course transformed leaves ; and 

 here, in these weak flowers, where the tendency of the vital course is almost 

 as near to foliar organs as to floral parts, we find these leafy-looking bracts 

 are trifoliate. The central lobe is composed of a short petiole, and a small 

 oval leaf blade. Sometimes this attempt of the lower axil to produce a flower 

 proves abortive. The already formed petals die away. In such cases the two 

 lateral leaflets die away also, and the little miniature central leaf goes on and 

 developes into one as large as the average on any part of the plant. But in 

 the stronger flowers we find, just in proportion to their strength, the two lat- 

 eral leaflets enlarge, and the central one diminish until at length it disappears, 

 petiole and ali. The laterais then adhere by their edges, become fleshy, and 

 end in being petals. These are clearly seen to be formed out of the adnated 

 lateral leaflets, which form the stipular sheaths in other cases, with the cen- 

 tral of the trifoliate leaf type absorbed. This observation, in addition to the 

 use I wish to make of it, confirms the views of some botanists, as I have 

 learned from Professor Asa Gray, that it is by metamorphosis of the petiolar 

 and stipular parts, rather than by modifications of the leaf blade, that petals 

 are formed. 



From these facts we gather the certainty of a trilobate type of leaf, and see 

 the adnation of the edges : and only the dorsal adhesion to the petiole 

 which I have shown so probable as almost to ainount to a certainty, is left to 

 be established by actual fact. 



This ternate division of the leaf is a marked character in Ranunculaceae, 

 and with this exposition of a ternate type in Magnoliaceae, its claim to a place 



1870.] 




116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



in the Kanal alliance, strong as it always has been acknowledged to be, is 

 still more strengthened. 



It is impossible to suppose that a so closely allied genus as Liriodendron 

 should be founded on a different type from Magnólia. We sball see that only 

 very slight causes, which we can well understand, have made some of the 

 chief foliar distinctions, and the few which we cannot prove from actual facts, 

 can be made almost certainties from parallel observations. The identity of 

 type will in th is way be manifest. 



First, as to the premorse or cut off appearance of the end of the leaf blade. 

 This ali results from the stipular portions being adnate with the stem axis, 

 instead of being wholly on the petiole as in Magnólia. In the latter the stip- 

 ules are carried along as the petiole advances, the leaf blade cannot grow be- 

 yond, and so in vernation has to lie flat up against them. In Liriodendron, the 

 stipules being fast to the main stem, the petiole carries the leaf blade beyond 

 them, over which it is bent until its apex is brought down in contact with the 

 straight line formed by the union of stipule and stem. Here it is pressed as into 

 a mould by the elongating petiole, and the form of the leaf which we see is the 

 necessary result. These processes in Magnólia and Liriodendron can readily be 

 seen on an examination of the buds at any time during the growing season ; and 

 to those who have no specimens the figure of the latter in Gray's Genera will 

 easily give the idea. It may be here noted that those who look only to Mr. 

 Darwin's principie of natural selection to account for the laws of form, might 

 be troubled by such cases as these. It is scarcely conceivable that a square- 

 edged leaf blade, as we find it in IAriodendron, is of any special benefit to the 

 species ; yet if this form is the consequence of some other act, which is a ben- 

 efit, the selection principie may still hold. 



If the ternate type of leaf is probable in Liriodendron, as in Magnólia, the 

 lower portion of the petiole, and lateral or stipular portions, must have ad- 

 nated with the stem prior to the full development of the leaf. This view ne- 

 cessitates the idea that the leaf does not always originate at the node from 

 which it seems to spring. I do not believe it does; but I am well aware that 

 in this I have opposed to me the weight of our best botanical authorities, from 

 whom I would not yet dare to positively differ until I shall have the weight of 

 more facts. I would only say that in the case of Liriodendron the appearances 

 are much in favor of the belief thatin an early stage the petiole clasped the stem, 

 and for a considerable length ultimately became an integral part of its cortical 

 system. The vessels which are seen connected in direct lines with the peti- 

 oles below and above the node, as they are in existence before the leaf bud 

 has opened, and the leaf blade has had any chance to elaborate sap from the 

 light or air, supposed to be necessary just above before they could be formed, 

 do not seem to originate at the node ; while the fact that these vessels suddenly 

 curve from the opposite side towards the supposed petiolar base is much more 

 characteristic of an unfolding sheath than of a descending current of matter 

 which would most naturally go down in a straightish line. But that the peti- 

 ole has really adnated with the stem in this way in Liriodendron seems most 

 probable from the fact that on the opposite side from the leaf is often seen a 

 ridge which could hardly be formed except by the meeting of two edges en- 

 closing a stem, with a little to spare ; and at other times there is a slight de- 

 pression, as if the two opposite edges barely met. There seems to be every 

 evidence short of an actual witnessing of the fact, that the petiole in Lirio- 

 dendron became adnate with the stem, and in this way the two lateral sections 

 (stipules) were brought in contact with the stem with which they united. This 

 would bring them nearer the sources of nutrition, and enable them to assume 

 a more leaf-like and permanent character than if on the petiole. They become 

 rather primary than secondary leaf organs, and this is just what w r e see them 

 to be. 



Thus we may assume that Magnólia has typically a ternate leaf strueture ; 

 that the stipules are the two lateral lobes which by a peculiar process of ad- 



[Oct.

nation became stipular sheaths after having been partially organized as leaf 

 blade ; and that Liriodendron differs from Magnólia only in possessing a greater 

 power of adnation. 



Notes on SILPHITJM LACINIATUM, L.— The Compass Plant. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



It is at once the strength aud the weakness of science that it takes little on 

 trust. One would suppose that, after the positive facts given by President 

 Hill in his paper before the recent meeting of the American Association, there 

 was no room for doubt that the edges of the leaves of Silphium laciniatum had 

 an average bearing north. But I find men — excellent, acute observers — who 

 doubt the facts. They say " We took the trouble to examine the plants on 

 the spot, and found not the slightest trace of any such tendency ; we want no 

 better evidence than that of our own senses." 



As before suggested, it is an excellent habit to verify, for ourselves, the 

 facts reported by others — there is far too little of this habit, — but when the 

 observations conflict, it is safer to assume that both are right, and that there 

 is something yet undiscovered which would harmonize the opposition, than 

 that either one is wrong. 



In this matter of the Silphium or M compass plant " I was able to find this 

 missing link, and to see that both parties were right. 



When I first saw the Silphium, to any great extent, in its natural localities, 

 there was not the slightest indication of this northern tendency. It was a 

 great surprise, as a limited knowledge of it before had taught the reverse. I 

 determined to watch a plant carefully on my own grounds the next year. The 

 result was just as described by President Hill. There was the unmistakable 

 northern tendency in the leaves when they first came up, and until they were 

 large and heavy, when winds and rains bore them in different directions, and 

 they evidently had not the power of regaining the points lost. This often 

 took place by their own weight alone, especially in luxuriant specimens. Mr. 

 Hill says it was in June when he saw them on the prairies, ali bearing north • 

 when I saw them, and not doing so, it was early in September, and then no 

 doubt the mechanical causes l have referred to, had been in operation. 



The plant I have had in my garden now for some years affords much in- 

 terest in many respects. I learned an useful lesson from it this year, in refer- 

 ence to the relative rates of growth in the different parts of the inflorescence. 

 Noticing that there appeared to be no growth in the disk florets in the day, 

 I determined to note accurately one morning during the last week in August, 

 exactly when growth did commence. The ray flowers close over the disk 

 during night, and at 4 A. M., with day just dawning in the east, I found the 

 ray petals just commencing to open back. In the disk there are about fifteen 

 coils of florets in the spiral. There appeared no motion until 4.40, although 

 no doubt growth commenced at 4, when the ray petals were in motion, but 

 too slow to be perceptible. At 4.40, however, the five outer circles were evi- 

 dently slightly elevated above the others in the disk. Then follows the fol- 

 lowing record in my diary : 



4.45. The five divisions of the corolla split open. 



4.50. Corollas grown three thirty-seconds of an inch. 



4.55. Divisions of corolla fully expanded. 



5. Florets two-eightbs above the rest of the disk. It might be well to say 

 here that there was no growth in any this morning but in the five outside 

 rows we are speaking of. 



5.5, 5.10. No apparent change except that some which were not so perfectly 

 opened as the others seemed to become so. 



5.15. Pistil and mass of stamens slightly elevate above the levei of the 

 corolla.

5.20. Corollas now about five-sixteenths of an inch above the others in 

 disk. Pistils and stamens about two lines above the corollas. Long yellow 

 ray petals half open, with no appearance of pollen on their pistils. 



From this time forward there was no further growth of the corolla, so that 

 this portion of the daily labor was accomplished in about three-quarters of 

 an hour.

5.40. " " « ... fth " 



5.45, 5.50. No change. 



5.55. Pistils begin to project beyond the stamens. The first insect, a sand 

 wasp appears. He inserts his proboscis down between the clavate pistil and 

 the stamens, carrying away the pollen, which is ali over his head. 



6, 6.5. Pistils one line ; stamens no longer lengthen. 



6.10. Anthers are falling away from the pistils, which are two lines beyond. 



6.15. No change. 



6.20. The ray petals now fully open, that is horizontal. 



No change was noticed after this, except the free visits of sandwasps; none 

 of these, however, carried any pollen to the pistils in the ray florets. 



About 9 o'clock (there had not been the slightest indications of any growth 

 since 6.20) heavier insects began to arrive, and then the slightest touch broke 

 off the florets, which fell on the ray pistils which happened to be below them, 

 and in this way they were fertilized. These pistils died very soon afterwards. 

 Those pistils on the upper side (the flower leaning a little) were quite fresh 

 the next morning, awaiting some chance to be fertilized, insects, evidently, 

 not performing that office. 



We here see that there were three phases of growth, with a slight rest be- 

 tween each, the pistil taking the most time, then the stamens, and the corolla 

 the least ; hut the whole growth of the day included within two hours. 



I have used the term pistil for the clavate process which occupies the place 

 of the true organ in the ray florets. Of course only the ray floret of Silphium 

 have perfect pistils. This clavate false pistil, or ovary, has hitherto been sup- 

 posed to be a necessary production for the fertilization of the plant. It was 

 supposed to push out the pollen, which was thereby scattered to the ray florets 

 about it. But these observations show that this is probably an error, and 

 that fertilization is chiefly carried on by the easy falling away of the mass of 

 stamens, as I have shown in a paper on Euphorbia Jacgumceflora, in last years 

 Proceedings, is the case with that species. 



I am anxious to call particular attention to the different ratios of growth 

 in connection with the appearance of different floral organs in this plant, be- 

 cause I think I see traces of a general law in plants that there are vibrations 

 or varying intensities during each season's growth, and that the production of 

 various organs depends on degrees of these vibrations.

D. II. 26. A. 16 scales 11 — 98 — 46, eounted from base of second dorsal spine. 

 Dorsal fins connected by membrane as elevated as that of the íirst dorsal. 

 Head (from preruaxilla to end of spine) moretban four times íd length includ- 

 ing caudal fin. Pectorals not narrowed. Eye 5.33 times in length of head. 

 Otherwise as in P. maculatus Hol. 



Color dark brown, eovered with large round pale spots as large as the orbit, 

 each with a brown central spot. They extend on the dorsal and proximal 

 caudal fins. Second dorsal, anal, and caudal fin broadly blackish edged. 



Another character in which this species differs from P. maculatus is the 

 gentle and gradual rise of the lateral line from the suprascapula. In the 

 latter, it forms a weak sigmoid with abrupt upward curvature. From New- 

 port, Rhode Island ; discovered by my friend Samuel Powell of that place, 

 among many other highly interesting fishes. As no one else has detected the 

 Promicropterus decoratus on any other part of the coast of the United States, it 

 must be a rare species. Prof. Gill originally described it as coming from 

 Panamá. 



Yomer curtus Cope, sp. nov. 



This species is imtermediate in form between Vomer setipinnis Mitch., and 

 Selene argêntea Lac. It is, therefore, shorter and deeper than the former, and 

 with dorsal and ventral outline more convex. The pectoral fin is also longer, 

 and the eye larger. The prominence of the front is anterior in position to 

 that which it oceupies in the latter, hence the fish has a less rhomboid, and 

 more regular form. The íirst anal ray is further in advance of the first of the 

 second dorsal than in V. brownii, and not so far as in S. argêntea. 



Radii D. Ill with membrane, III without, — 22. A 19. The pectoral reaches 

 the ventral outline at the tenth soft anal ray. The greatest depth of the head 

 measured along the anterior limb of the orbit enters the total to the caudal 

 emargination 1-8 times — in V. setipinnis 2-5 times ; depth at first anal ray, in 

 the same, 1-66 times ; in V. setipinnis nearly twice. Eye into length of head, 

 horizontally through orbit, 2-lb times ; into length along front, 4-6 times. 

 Muzzle projecting enclosing a strong concavity with front line much stronger 

 than in V. brownii or S. argêntea. Total length Om. 165. Length of head from 

 muzzle along lower margin of orbit Om. 046. Color silvery, without spots. 



A second specimen from the North American Atlantic coast, the precise 

 locality not recorded. Bonaparte collection in Mus. Academy Natural 

 Sciences. 



The strueture of the fins in this species is precisely similar to that seen in 

 V. setipinnis, and in general it resembles that species very closely. The dif- 

 ferences are readily observed on comparison with specimens of the latter of 

 the same size.

 the same. 



This species was discovered by my friend Samuel Powell, at Newport, 

 Rhode Island, Sept., 1867. It must be a very rare species, as it has not been 

 met with elsewhere, so far as I am aware. I have pleasure in dedicating it 

 to the discoverer, whose attention to ichthyology has been so often attended 

 with interesting results.

 citron yellow, which is bounded abruptly by the ground color behind, at a 

 point a little in advance of the anal fin. The posterior outline rises irregu- 

 larly half way to the lateral line and then turns forward and descends a short 

 distance behind the pectoral fin. From this patch backwards to the basis of 

 the caudal fin there are five vertical cross-bands, two on the peduncle and two 

 rising from the anal fin. The latter diverge above and another band rises, 

 expanding to the point of junction of the dorsal fins, and spreads in a rounded

Prof. Leidy exhibited the tooth of a reptile which had been submitted to 

 his examination from the Smithsonian Institution. The specimen, he ob- 

 served, was especially interesting, as it apparently pertained to a mosasau- 

 roid, and was obtained from the raiocene tertiary deposit of Gay Head, Mar- 

 tha's Vineyard. 



The crown of the tooth is curved conical, and is without divisional planes. 

 The inner surface is only feebly defined from the outer, by a single imper- 

 feetly developed ridge postero-internally. 



The enamel is singularly roughened, due to short vermicular, somewhat 

 ramifying and more or less interrupted ridges, giving it a fretted or lettered 

 appearance. The transverse section of the crown is circular. 



The fang of the tooth, broken below and on the inner side so as to expose 

 the interior pulp cavity, is longer than the crown and very gibbous. It is 

 curved in the directiou of the crown and is ovoidal in shape. The texture of 

 the fang appears as dense as ivory. No impress exists ou the exterior of the 

 fang, resulting from contact with a successional tooth, but a deep groove oc- 

 cupies its inner side at the terminal extremity. 



The crown is broken at its apex, but when perfect has been about 16 

 lines long, measured on the outer side. The diameter at base is a little over 

 half the length. The fang has been about two inches long; its diameter is 

 17 lines. 



The tooth evidently indicates an animal heretofore unknown to us, and I 

 therefore propose for it the name of Graphiodon vinearius ; the generic term 

 having allusion to the lettered appearance of the enamel of the tooth. 



Prop. Leidy further remarked that he had recently received from Prof. 

 Hayden's expedition a collection of fossils, mostly consisting of remains of 

 turtles and crocodiles. He formerly had expressed surprise at the absence of 

 remains of the latter among the great profusion of remains of mammals and 

 turtles in the Mauvaises Terres deposits of White River and the sands of the 

 valley of the Niobrara River. He now felt some wonder at seeing so many 

 crocodilian remains, apparently of cotemporaneous age with some of the 

 latter. The reptilian remains are generally in a very fragmentary condition, 

 and nave been picked up from the surface of the country. Several unde- 

 scribed species of turtles were recognizable, but these would be characterized 

 at a later period. 



From among the crocodilian remains he had been able to obtain a large 

 portion of those of a skull of Crocodilus Elliotti, indicated a few evenings 

 ago from a jaw fragment. The skull appears to have nearly the form of that 

 of C vulgaris and C. biporcatus. It is about a foot and a half in length. 

 Teeth appear to have been absent at the extreme fore part of the jaw. Im- 

 mediately behind their usual position the palate presents a deep pit at each 

 side of the naso-palatine orifice. The jaw is deeply indented laterally, just 

 back of the position of the fourth tooth, and a less indentation is situated 

 back of the ninth tooth. 



Prcp. Leeds caUed attention to a crystalline specimen of the variety of 

 Apatite called Staffelite, which he had not previously noticed in that condi- 

 tion. 



Mr. Willard made some remarks on a deposit of clay, of which a specimen 

 was presented this evening. The deposit, at White Hall, Bordentown, N. J., 

 had been found to be too hard and tough for digging, and required blasting 

 to be removed.

Twenty-two members present. 



A paper was presenteei for publication entitled, " Bud Varieties," 

 by Thomas Meehan. 



Prop. Leidy directed attention to some remains of reptiles on the table, 

 which were part of the collection of fossils recently sent to hira from Wyo- 

 ming by Prof. Hayden. They consist of the remains of three species of tur- 

 tles and a lacertian, which were briefly characterized and named as follows : 



Emys Jeanesi. — The species is founded upon a shell consisting of the nearly 

 complete carapace and sternum, the former much crushed and distorted late- 

 rally. The carapace has been prominently convex, with the margins acute 

 and without conspicuous indentations. The sternum is as well developed as 

 in our common living emydes and of the same shape. The fore part of the 

 sternum forms a semicircle slightly truncate ; the back part is moderately 

 notched, the notch being about half an inch in depth. 



The intermediate vertebral scutes are longer than broad, and their anterior 

 margin is transversely bow-like, with a deep median angle forward. The sides 

 of the second vertebral scute, joining the first pair of costal scutes, are con- 

 vex outwardly ; joining the second of the latter, are convex inwardly. 



The axillary and inguinal scutes are broader than long. The abdominal 

 and femoral scutes are of nearly equal depth, about 2\ inches; the humeral 

 are half an inch less ; and the pectoral and caudal an inch less. 



The sternum is a foot in length ; its anterior portion is 3J inches deep and 

 5 inches wide ; its posterior portion 3f inches deep and 5^ inches wide. 



The length of the carapace in the curve has been about fifteen inches; the 

 width about nine and a half inches. 



The species I have dedicated to my friend Joseph Jeanes, through whose aid 

 we have been enabled to make many additions to the store of palíeontological 

 knowledge. 



Emys Haydeni. — This species is founded upon an imperfect carapace of an 

 animal probably about the size of the last, but which had not yet reached 

 maturity. It may be distinguished from it by the form of the scute impres- 

 sions. The intermediate vertebral scutes are longer than broad, as in the for- 

 mer. The anterior border of the second vertebral scute is straight, as are 

 also the sides of junction with the first pair of costal seutes, the three lines 

 together forming three sides of a square. The anterior border of the third 

 vertebral scute is nearly straight ; and that of the fourth is deeply bow-like 

 and convex backward. 



Notwithstanding I have already dedicated several extinct species of animais 

 to my friend Prof. Hayden, I still add another to the list in commemoration of 

 the very many discoveries he has made in vertebrate palseontology. 



Baena arenosa. — The genus and species are founded on the greater part of 

 the shell of a turtle, with the carapace broken away in front and fractured in 

 other positions. The sternum, more perfect, has lost its fore extremity. The 

 shell belonged to a mature animal, as indicated by the obliteration of the su- 

 tures of the plates composing the carapace. The surface of the latter, but 

 more especially that of the sternum, presents a finely fretted appearance. 



The carapace is moderately convex and bears a resemblance to that of our 

 common Snapper (Chelydra serpentina). It is, however, not depressed along 

 the middle, which is the most elevated portion of the fóssil. The lateral mar- 

 ginal plates are comparatively large and broad, and are abruptly bent. The 

 posterior portion of the carapace, both laterally and at the extremity, is 



1870.] 




124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



notched much in the same manner as in the Snapper. The intermediate ver- 

 tebral scute impressions have nearly the form and proportions as in the latter, 

 but are not carinated in the median line, and the posterior line of the fourth 

 vertebral scute impression is deeply and widelj notched íbrward. 



The sternum is very unlike that of the Snapper, aud rather approaches that 

 of the emydes in its form and proportions. The interspaces of the carapace 

 and sternum are, however, intermediate in capacity to those in the former 

 and latter. The sternal pedicels are deep and wide, and are impressed by a 

 pair of large scutes, separating the large axillary and inguinal scute, as in the 

 existing Dermatemys. The posterior extremity of the sternum in outline is 

 half oval and feebly notched. 



When complete the shell has measured between a foot and fourteen inches 

 in length and about ten inches in breadth. The sternum has been about ten 

 and a half inches long ; its pedicels are 5^- inches deep ; and it3 posterior ex- 

 tremity is 3 inches long by 4£ inches wide at base. 



For the genus I have adopted a name which, according to Prof. Hayden, is 

 used by one of the Indian tribes of the Upper Missouri as that of a turtle. 

 The species I propose to name Baena arenosa. 



Saniwa ensidens. — Among the fossils obtained in Prof. Hayden's expedi- 

 tion are the remains of a lacertian, labeled as having been discovered near 

 " Granger." The bonés consist of those of most parts of the skeleton, but are 

 âll in a fragmentary condition, and are imbedded in freshly broken pieces of 

 an ash-colored rock. Before disturbance they appear to have been mostly 

 entire and preserved nearly in conjunetion. They are black, and their inte- 

 rior is occupied with crystalline calcite. 



Fragments of bonés exhibit well developed limbs, with long toes, strong 

 ribs, and a long tail, altogether indicating a form like that of ordinary living 

 lacertians. The long bonés, even to those of the toes, are hollow. The vér- 

 tebras exhibit the bali and socket articulation of their bodies, but only a sin- 

 gle pair of zygapophyses in front and behind. No zygantral and zygosphenal 

 articulation appears to have existed. 



The articular bali of the vertebral body is much wider than high. and is 

 directed upward, with an inclination backward. 



The body of several dorsais is quite straight inferiorly. fore and aft, and 

 measures half an inch in length. The bali is four lines wide, and about half 

 as thick. The breadth at the anterior zygapophyses is eight lines, and at the 

 articulations for the ribs, just exterior to the latter, three-fourths of an 

 inch. 



An anterior caudal has its body the same length as in the preceding. Its 

 bali is 3£ lines by 1\ thick. The width at the anterior zygapophyses is half 

 an inch. 



Hypapophyses for the articulation of chevrons are situated one-fourth the 

 length of the body from the posterior extremity. 



A tooth was found, after careful search, in proximity to what appear to be 

 traces of the skull. It consisted of the crown, broken from its connection, 

 the character of which therefore cannot be ascertained. 



The crown of the tooth is compressed conical, slightly curved inwardly and 

 backward, sharp-pointed, with abruptly impressed trenchant borders ; is 

 smooth and shining. It is hollow and has thick walls. The transverse sec- 

 tion is rhomboidally oval, with acute polés. The length is about \\ lines; the 

 breadth f of a line ; the thickness \ a line. 



The remains would indicate an animal as large as the largest of our living 

 iguanians. 



For the generic name of the animal I would propose to use the euphonious 

 one of Saniwa, which, according to Prof. Hayden, is that used by one of the 

 Indian tribes of the Upper Missouri for a rock lizard. The species may be 

 named Saniwa ensidens.

Mr. Thomas Mebhax referred to a potato presented to the Academy some 

 months ago by Mr. Henszey, a raember, which had the appearance of one po- 

 tato growing out of the centre of another. The opinion of ali who saw it 

 was that it was really a case of this kind. It had been handed to him bythe 

 curators, and on dissection, though no exact place of origin could be traced, 

 there seeined nothing to iadicate any other theory of origin than that one po- 

 tato had really grown out of the centre of the other. 



But there were serious physiological reasons in the "way of such a theory. 

 A potato tuber is really but a thickened axis, in which the greater part of the 

 interior structure would be incapable of developing a bud which would pro- 

 duce a tuber such as this one had done. The origin of a new tuber from an 

 old one would be nearer the old ones surface. He had been looking for some 

 further explanatory facts", and believed he had them here this evening, in the 

 potato tubers he now handed to the members. They were about the size of 

 hen eggs, and were pierced in every dircetion by stolons of the common couch 

 grass, Triticum repetis. They had gone completely through, as if they were so 

 much wire, and in one instance two tubers had become strung together by 

 the same stolon, as if they were two beads on a string. One would suppose 

 that the apex of the stolon, when it carne in contact with the hard surface of 

 the tuber, would turn aside and rather follow the softer line of the earth ; but 

 there was no appearance of any inclination to depart from their direct course. 

 They had gone apparently straight through. He had no doubt the potato be- 

 fore referred to was a similar case, a potato stolon had penetrated another potato, 

 and instead of going through as these grass spears had done, terminated in 

 the centre, and formed the new potato there. 



It was worthy of thought whether so much attention had been given to this 

 direct force in plants as the subject deserved. It was well known that a 

 mushroom would lift a paving stone many times it own weight, rather than 

 turn over and grow sideways, which it would appear so much easier for it to 

 do; and tree roots growing against walls would throw immensely strong ones 

 over, though one would think the pressure against the softer soil would give 

 room for their development, without the necessity of their expending so much 

 force against the wall. 



November 15th. 



The President, Dr. Ruschenberger, in the Chair. 



Twenty-seven members present. 



A paper was presented for publication entitled " A Sketch of the 

 Classification of the American Anserinse," by B. H. Bannister. 



Prof. Leidy directed attention to some fóssil bonés which had been sub- 

 mitted to bis examination by Prof. J. D. Whitne}\ According to the accom- 

 panying label, they were found under Table Mountain, near ÍShaw Fiat, Tuo- 

 lumne Co., Califórnia. 



The bonés are friable, and have attached portions of a light ash colored 

 gravei. Several masses of the latter substance, accompanying the bonés, 

 contain casts of some fruit. 



The bonés are as follow : 



1. A metacarpal boné of a ruminant of large size. In form and construc- 

 tion it bears more resemblance to that of the Lama and Camel, than of other 

 ruminants with which I have the means of comparing it. As in the Lama 

 and Camel the lower articular extremities are divergent, and the articular 

 surfaces are provided with a median ridge only at the back part. In ordinary 

 ruminants, as in the Ox, Deer, Sheep, etc, the median ridge is produced the 

 entire extent fore and aft of the articular surfaces. The peculiar arrangement 



1870.] 9 




126 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OP 



in the extinct animal, as in the Lama and Camel, allowed a greater spread or 

 divergence of the toes in the extended condition. The fóssil boné is 19 inches 

 long; the breath of its proximal end is 3^ inches, of its distai end 4 inches. 

 In the skeleton of a Camel in our museum, the corresponding boné is 13 

 inches long. 



2. The distai extrernity of another metacarpal of the same animal. 



3. The proximal end of a fémur, probably of the same animal, with the 

 head of the boné 3 inches in diameter. An acetabulum of corresponding size 

 appears to have belonged to the same individual. 



4. Two fragments of a tibia probably of the same animal. 



The bonés mentioned probably represent a large extinct species of Lama, 

 which may be distinguished with the name of Auchenia Californica. Perhaps 

 the fossils represent a distinct genus, allied to the Lama, but this is a ques- 

 tion only to be determined by the discovery of other and more characteristic 

 remains of the animal. 



5. A first phalanx, in the collection, resembles in forra that of a represent- 

 ation of the same boné in the Lama, and is about the size of that in the 

 Camel. Perhaps it belongs to a small individual of the preceding extinct 

 forra ; probably to a smaller species. It is 3£ inches long, l£ inch wide at 

 the proximal end, and l\ inch wide at the distai end. The articulation of 

 the latter is not expanded beneath, as in the Camel, for the apposition of the 

 sesamoid bonés. 



6. The proximal three-fourths of a metacarpal, probably of a Deer. It is 

 of rather more robust proportions than the corresponding boné of the Virgí- 

 nia Deer. 



7. An incisor tooth of a small Horse, partially imbedded in a coherent 

 mass of gravei, which also contains the irapress of a nut-like fruit. 



8. Portion of a tibia of a small Horse, probably pertaining to the same 

 individual as the tooth just mentioned. 



9. The lower extremity of a metacarpal, probably of the same Horse. It 

 is proportionately thicker and less wide than in the corresponding boné of 

 the Domestic Horse. The articulation is 1J inch wide, and 16 lines fore and 

 aft at the median ridge. 



The equine remains perhaps belong to a Hipparion. 



10. A few fragments of undetermined bonés of other animais. 



Prof. Leidy further directed attention to a fóssil fragment of the lower jaw 

 of a small pachyderm, which Prof. Hayden had obtained from Henr)'s Fork 

 of Green River, Wyoming. The speciraen contained the fourth, the sixth and 

 the seventh molars. The teeth resemble in form and constitution those of 

 the Lophiotherium cervulum, a small pachyderm, described by Prof. Gervais, 

 from an eocene formation of France. The crowns of the fourth to the sixth 

 molars have four lobes ; that of the seventh molar has an additional lobe. 

 The crescentic summit of the postero-external lobe joins, by its anterior horn, 

 the antero-internal lobe. A proportionately well developed basal ridge em- 

 braces the crowns, except internally, where it is entirely absent. The series 

 of the hack four molars occupies a space of 16 lines. The last molar is 5£ 

 lines fore and aft. The base of the jaw is nearly straight the length of the 

 fragment, which is an inch and a half. The depth of the jaw below the fifth 

 molar is half an inch. The species may be named Lophiotherium sylva- 

 ticum. 



Prof. Leidy also remarked that the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal 

 Society of London, Pt. II, 1869, presented this evening, contained a paper by 

 Prof. Õwen, on the fóssil remains of Equines from Central and South Ame- 

 rica. It was of special interest to him on account of its being accompanied 

 with excellent illustrations of the dentition of the various species of existing

horses, which, in the absence of original specimens, aflforded him the oppor- 

 tunity of making coruparisons with the many equine teeth discovered in the 

 tertiary and quaternary deposits of North America. 



Prof. Owen describes a new species of Equus from South America, which 

 he names E. arcidens. From peculiarities of the teeth, he refers this species, 

 together with two others, also from South America, and named by Dr. Lund 

 E. principalis and E. neogaeus, to a genus with the name of Hippidion. From 

 some of the more important distinctive characters, viz., the extension back- 

 ward alone of the internai peninsular folds on the triturating surface of the 

 upper molars, a dozen years ago was established the genus Protohippus (Pr. A. 

 N. S. 1858, 26, with reference to fig. 1, pi. 7 of Gervais' Rech. s. 1. Mamuiiferes 

 Fossiles de TAmérique meridionale). On the same grounds were also included 

 in this genus the E. principalis and E. neogaeus of Lund, together with E. macro- 

 gnathus of Gervais, so far as the remains of the latter appeared to me to be 

 the equivalent of E. principalis, (Extinct Mammalia of Dakota and Nebraska, 

 &c, 1869, 276).* 



The species of equine animais referable to the genus thus far indicated are

 The genus, however, appears to me to be synonymous with Pheronema (Pr. A.

 tenia Carpenteri, with those of Pheronema Annx (Am. Naturalist, 1870, 21, 22), 

 leads me to suspect that the two are probably the same.

BTJD VARIETIES. 

 BY THOMAS MEEHAN. 



A few years ago, Mr. Isaac Burk, of the Academy, called my attention to a 

 form of Rubus villosus, L., in which the terminal leaflet was very large, cor- 

 date, and on very long petioles. It is a very striking variety, the leaflets 

 appearing at first glance like large linden leaves. He found them in Dela- 

 ware County. I have since gathered the same form near the intersection in 

 Chester County, near Port Clinton on the Reading Railroad, and along the 

 west bank of the Susquehanna, between Harrisburg and the mouth of the 

 Juniata. 



The general forms of Rubus villosus are found uniformly in ali parts of the 

 State, and, of course, witbout any break in their appearance between the 

 localities named above. The plant so easily maintains its existence by pieces 

 of roots, and grows as well in sunshine as in shade, in dry and poor as well 

 as in rich and damp places, that it is not easily eradicated when once it obtains 

 possession of the soil. On the idea that varieties origiuated from one common 

 centre, it is not easy to account for the existence of the same forms so many 

 miles apart, as we find in the above, except by the accidental carrying of seeds. 



But I have reason to believe that seeds of Rubus rarely germinate in a wild 

 state. In experiments which I have made in raising the seed artificially, none 

 of the seedlings come exactly like the parent. There is a certain general 

 resemblance, but some distinction, more or less, can be traced in each indi- 

 vidual But, in native places, one exact form will be found to occupy exten- 

 sive tracts. Sometimes several forms will be together, but only a very few. 

 If the seeds made plants readily, there would be innumerable forms, instead 

 of the very few we see. I found, in my experiments, that it took a long time 

 for a blackberry seed to germinate ; sometimes a whole year. Such seedlings 

 have a poor chance to vegetate in a state of nature. Other more rapidly- 

 growing vegetation would crowd it out. The only distributing agency I can 

 think of is that of birds. But I find no birds eat blackberry seeds ; and, if 

 they did, when we consider that of the millions of seeds which fali about the 

 place of their origin, few, if any grow ; the chance of those growing which 

 birds may carry, even if there be some to eat them, which I have failed to 

 find, is extremely small. Hence, we find great difficulty in believing that 

 identical forms of Rubus, widely separated, can have originated from a com- 

 mon centre. 



Something like this exists in some forms of Rubus occidentalis. There is a 

 form with a fruit having soft pulp, of a light purplish red, and comparatively 

 few seeds. This is known amongst botanists, though I do not know that a 



[Nov. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 129 



description has beea published, as R. neglectus, Peck. This form is found in 

 isolated places in New York, Northern Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Iowa, and per- 

 haps elsewhere. As in the case of the form of R. villosus referred to, there 

 does not seem to be any connection between the localities, as a common cen- 

 tre spreading by roots would imply, while there is the same difficulties in the 

 way of spreading by seeds as in the other. How, then, does this form origi- 

 nate in these widely separated places. 



Horticulture may help us to answer this question. It is well known that 

 fruits, after being grown for some time in one locality, will change their char- 

 acters to such an extent that a person acquainted with one will fail to recog- 

 nize it elsewhere, and ali this without the intervention of any seminal power. 

 Thus, the nectarine is believed to be a bud evolution from a peach ; the Penn 

 apple is a similar creation from Baldwin, and the Reading from the common 

 Isabella grape. Though apparently originating in this way from externai or 

 local causes, the characters peculiar in this change are retained when, by 

 grafts or cuttings, the plants are removed to other localities. It has also been 

 noted that the pears grown at Rochester, New York, have longer stems than 

 the same varieties grown further south ; but I do not know whether this pecu- 

 liarity, once originated, would follow the grafts or cuttings taken from them. 

 The curled-leaved willow, Salix babylonica annularis, was a branch from the 

 common weeping willow, which character it usually retains, though sometimes 

 a branch, resembling the common weeping, will push out from tbe tree. Of 

 like character is the well-known instance of purple-flowered laburnums some- 

 times pushing out from the common yellow-flowered one. But perhaps the 

 best known instances are those of the common potato. It is not at ali unfre- 

 quent to find some of quite another character and color in the same bill. 

 Those who contend for seed agency as the sole originator of varieties will 

 rather believe that there was some other variety of potato accidentally planted 

 with the other than that a new variety sprung from the bud alone. But the 

 evidence of origin from the same original potato-set has, in many instances, 

 been too direct to be doubted ; but, even here, rather than admit the doctrine 

 of development through buds, I have heard it assumed, by intelligent botanists, 

 that the flowers in such cases must have b'en impregnated with other pollen, 

 and, in some way, the descending sap brought about a sort of hybridism or 

 bud change in these tubers. I have also heard excellent and leading botan- 

 ists (two of them authors of some of our leading works) suggest that many 

 of the varieties of Rabus in existence must be u hybrids." Of course, this is ali 

 assumption, founded on extensive observation, no doubt ; but yet on probably 

 no better foundation than my own idea with which I set out in this paper — 

 that often, at least in the cases I have referred to, hybridization is highly im- 

 probable. 



I have here, however, and exhibit with this paper, evidence of bud varia- 

 tion, in which there is no possibility of hybridism. A root of the common 

 sweet potato, Convoloulus batatas, in which some of the tubers are of the red 

 Bermuda, and the others of the white Brazilian variety. 



The sweet potato never flowers in tbis part of the country, so that seminal 

 power could have had no influence whatever on the phenomenon. Even in 

 the south, and I believe elsewhere, where this plant is cultivated for its roots, 

 it rarely flowers, and I think there is little doubt but that the whole ten or 

 twelve varieties under culture have originated without seed, and in the way 

 we see them here. 



The points I wish to make in this paper are : — 



Ist. That identical varieties sometimes appear in localities unfavorable to 

 the idea of a common centre of origin. 



2d. Varieties have originated in which probably no hybridism or any seminal 

 agency operated. 



3d. Varieties have certainly originated in the sweet potato by evolution, 



1870.J 




130 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



without seminal agency, and that the same variety in this way has appeared 

 in widely-separated districts. 



4th. As the discoveries of Darwin have shown in many cases, varieties to be 

 the parents of species, species may originate in widely-separated localities 

 by bud variation. 



A Sketch of the Classification of the American ANSERIN51. 

 BY B. H. BANNISTER. 



The following remarks are based upon an examination of the specimens of 

 American geese in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. 



The subfamily Anserinaí by many recent authors is made to include the 

 genera Dendrocygna and Chenalopex, and doubtless correctly. In the present 

 paper, however, we shall not consider these genera, leaving them provision- 

 ally out of the subfamily ; if included, they would form at least one well 

 marked section, following those we are about to describe. 



The distinguishing characters of the Anserinoe, as thus limited to the true 

 geese, are, the lengthened tarsus, covered with hexagonal or subquadrate 

 scales ; the neck more elongated than in the ducks and less so than in the 

 swans ; the short, high bill gradually narrowing toward the tip, which is 

 altogether composed of the large recurved nail ; together with the more or 

 less terrestrial habit of life, and the usually similar plumage of the two 

 sexes. 



The geese of the North American continent have been long known, and 

 being for the most part closely allied to, and in many cases identical with, 

 well known European forms, they fali readily into the systematic subdivisions 

 based upon the latter. In the temperate regions of South America, however, 

 the Anserinae are of a rather aberrant type, and have been less completely 

 studied. They difíer chiefly from the North American and European species 

 in possessing metallic tints on the plumage, and in having in two of the 

 genera the coloration of the two sexes widely different. These ditFerences 

 appear to be exclusively regional, none of the aberrant forms being found in 

 North America, and vice versa. 



Another basis of division of the American Anserinae is found in the 

 presence, in two species — one North American and the other a Southern fornr 

 — of deep rough superorbital depressions and reversed relative proportions of 

 the tarsus and middle toe, together with an exclusively sea coast habitat, and 

 a carnivorous diet, corresponding in some of these respects to the Oideniioe 

 and Somateriae amongst the ducks. 



These latter characters we have taken as the basis of the two sections into 

 Avhicli we divide the subfamily, as at present considered, since they correspond 

 with equivalent characters in one of the subdivisions of the Fuligulinse. The 

 presence of the deep superorbital depressions is a very general character 

 amongst the carnivorous natatores, though not universal. 



The following is oífered as an outline of the divisions and genera of the 

 subfamily, noting briefly the principal generic characters, the American spe- 

 cies and their geographical distribution. The principal characters of the 

 subfamily have been already given at sufficient length.

Prop. Cope made some observations on a number of species of reptiles from 

 the Cretaceous beds of Kansas, which he had recently studied. He stated 

 that the specimens included parts of Elasmosaurus platyurus Cope, Polycotylus 

 latipinnis Cope, Liodon proriger Cope, and two new Liodons, which he named 

 L. ictericus and L. mudgei respectively. They both belonged to the division 

 with depressed vertebral centra, and the L. ictericus was near L. validus Cope, 

 of New Jersey, but exhibited a less anterior, and less prominent proximal 

 externai angle of the quadratum. which Prof. Cope stated indicated a less 

 extensive lateral flexibility of the raraus of the mandible. 



In L. Mudgei the angle was still more posterior, and the pterygoid teeth 

 were not pleurodont, as in Platecarpus tympaniticus. Remains of the cranium 

 indicated a reptile of 30 feet in length, while those of the L. ictericus be- 

 longed to two individuais of 40 and 50 feet in length. A third new Mosa- 

 sauroid of the size of the L. Mudgei was described under the name of Clidastes 

 cineriorum. It was stated to be much the largest species of the genus, and to 

 differ from the three now known in having the plane of the articular extrera- 

 ities at right angles to the long axis of the centra, and not oblique to it. 

 From near Sheridan, Kansas; described by Prof. B. F. Mudge. He described 

 a third new Liodon, of gigantic size, stating it to exceed by very much the 

 Maastricht reptile, and even the Mosasaurus brumbzi Gibbes, which was till 

 now the largest known species. He pointed out the characters of the verte- 

 brae, which were very much depressed as to the centram, which measared 5f 

 inches in diameter. It was allied to the M. brumbzi, but diífered ia having a 

 strong emargioatiou of the articular faces to accommodate the ueural caaal. 

 He uamed it Liodon dyspelor. 



Prof. Cope also exhibited the humeri aad femora of Polycotylus, which 

 were like those of Plesiosaurus, and measured 18 inches in length. 



Mr. Thomas Meehan exhibited several specimens of the Madura aurantiaca, 

 the common osage orange, in wmich the plants were inarched together in 

 pairs in a remarkable way. He said the osage orange was extensively grown 

 as a hedge plant, and in digging up the one year plants, these united twins 

 were usually fouud ia the proportioa of about oue score ia tea thousaad. 

 Double keraels were commoa oceurreaces ia maay seeds. There were double 

 peaches, almonds, and double yolks in eggs. But these ali had their separate 

 seed coverings or membranes, and the yolks their own albuminous euvelopes, 

 cousequeutly the separate embryos produced distioct plauts. But these iudi- 

 cated that there had beea two separate embryos uuder one seminal covering, 

 and that the radicular portions of this double embryo, having no membrane 

 to separate them, had inarched themselves together while passiog to the 

 ground. If this was the true explanation, he thought there was no such case 

 recorded. That it was true seemed probable, from the fact that ali the speci- 

 mens were united in exactly the same manaer, showiog that tiaie, place, aad 

 the circumstaaces of the uaioa were uaiformly the same. The scars showed 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 133 



that there were four cotyledons and two germs, and that the place of union 

 was midway between the pairs of cotyledons. From the base of the cotyledons 

 extending the whole length of the radicle, the union existed. The length of 

 this united part was from half an inch to one inch, according to the vigor 

 of the plant. 



Another lesson he thought was afforded by these specimens. Dr. AsaGray 

 had recently remarked, in Sillimaris Journal, that European botanists still be- 

 lieved what American botanists had learned to doubt, that the radicle v/as a 

 true root, rather than a morphologized joint of stem. Here was, he believed, 

 an illustration of the American view. These radicles, which had evidently 

 united together under the seed coat, had elongated after protrusion, just as a 

 young shoot with ali its parts formed in the bud elongates after the bursting 

 of the bud scales. They comprised the half inch, or inch united portions be- 

 fore referred to. If these radicular portions of the seed were of the nature of 

 root rather than of stem, we might expect to see lateral fibres push from them, 

 as we do see from the true roots, which start out below the union. But these 

 parts are as free from rootlets asanyportion of the true stems above the coty- 

 ledon points, indicating, as had been suggested, that their properties were 

 rather of stem than of root.

Prof Leidy exhibited a lower jaw of an aged man, recently obtained in his 

 dissecting room. The teeth had ali been lost except one, and the alveolar 

 border had been absorbed so that the body of the boné was reduced as usual 

 to half its original depth. The remaining tooth is a completely developed 

 and full grown third molar of large size, which lies imbedded in the jaw hori- 

 zontally, with the unworn triturating surface directed towards the position 

 which had been occupied by the teeth in advance. The tooth is perfectly 

 sound, and in this old jaw, in which ali the other teeth had been lost and the 

 alveoli obliterated, favors the view that the teeth are liable to caries only 

 when exposed to exterior influences. Similar specimens of teeth remaining 

 imbedded in the jaw are not unfrequent, but the one exhibited is the oldest 

 which Prof. Leidy had seen. 



Prof. Leidy also exhibited a wood carving from St. Paul de Loando, West- 

 ern Africa, presented to him by Dr. Charles L. Cassin, U. S. N. The carving, 

 by a native African, represents two adult human figures, apparently of the two, 

 united by an intervening plate, so as to remind one of the famous Siamese 

 twins. The connection may have been merely intended for support, though 

 Prof. Leidy thought the carving may have been intended to represent a pair 

 of united twins, similar to those just named, and which existed in the locality 

 in which the carving was made.

Prof. Leidy directed attention to a preparation of the trunk of an adult 

 male subject, from the dissecting roora of the University, in which ali the vís- 

 cera were reversed ia the order of their usual position. The heart is reversed 

 in position with its apex directed to the right. The aorta descends on the 

 right 'side ; and the cavae are placed on the left of the vertebral column. 

 The liver is placed in the left, the spleen in the right side. The stomach is 

 reversed, and the large intestine commencing in the left iliac region termi- 

 nates in the rectum from the right side. 



Theo. D. Rand called the attention of the Academy to a remarkable expo- 

 sure of rock on the North Pennsylvania Railroad, between Abingdon and Edge 

 Hill stations, about eleven miles from Philadelphia. The rock is Potsdam 

 sandstone, highly micaceous, in strata nearly vertical, and divided by frequent 

 joints. Its strike is about N. by E. At the point mentioned a quarry has 

 been opened following the crest of the hill, the northern end of the quarry 

 giving therefore a section. At the bottom of the excavation the layers seem 

 undisturbed and perfectly vertical, but above they are thrown to the south- 

 west and crushed and broken in a remarkable manner, the layers nearest the 

 surface being horizontal or even dipping to the S. W., but still retaining their 

 relative positions. The breaks in the rocks are fresh and sharp, and the 

 spaces between them empty, and the whole appearance is as if a very recent 

 force acting near the surface had thrown them from a vertical into their 

 present positions. Some of these spaces were two or three inches in width 

 and apparently of great depth. 



It is probable, however, that it is due to a folding of the strata, as íd the 

 cut of the Railroad immediately west of this exposure. The rocks of the quar- 

 ry appear perfectly vertical while south of them, probably fifty feet, is a well 

 defined anticlinal axis or fold. Still the broken, not bent condition of the 

 rocks, their very marked and sudden change from the vertical, the freshness 

 and sharpness of the fractures seem almost irreconcilable with a fold taking 

 place as long ago as this anticlinal axis, and it is well worthy of examination 

 by geologists.

Prof. Leeds called attention to an interesting geological phenomenon in 

 the vicinity of Wayne station on the Germantown Railroad, about three miles 

 from Philadelphia. At the point where Wayne street cuts through a fold in 

 the micaceous schists of this district, there occur huge imbedded boulders of 

 very hard compact hornblende rock. The matrix of mica schist has the ap- 

 pearance of an altered argillaceous slate, and rapidly decays on exposure. 

 The hornblende rocks are thus left protruding above the soil, aud would be 

 difficult to account for if attention had not previously been called to them in 

 place. As occurring in the schist, they are rounded upon their corners and 

 edges and smooth upon the sides. It does not appear an improbable con- 

 jecture to suppose that they constituted a part of a primitive surface forma- 

 tion — perhaps the original earth crust — which was broken up before the de- 



[Dec.

position of the metamorphic rocks which make up the azoic rocks of nnde- 

 termiaed geological age, overlying the southeastern angle of Pennsylvania. 

 And tbat by stream and current actions, perhaps in part by glacial, tbey were 

 brougbt into the shape of boulders at a time anterior to the deposition of the 

 sedimentary mica schists. 



And it is a fact of interest in this connection that the highly garnetiferous 

 mica schists of this district, are charged with dodecahedral garnets, which 

 probably have belonged to pre-existent rocks, inasmuch as their angles and 

 edges are rounded off, and the crystals reduced to an almost globular form. 

 This is true of the garnets while still firmly imbedded in the mica schists, and 

 applies to th« garnetiferous mica schists extending over a wide área. 



On favorable report of the Committees, the following papers were 

 ordered to be printed. 



Remarks on Dr. Asa Gray's notes on Buckley's new Plants of Texas. 

 BY PROF. S. B. BUCKLEY. 



In the spring of 1862 Dr. Asa Gray had two papers in the Proceedings of 

 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, both of which were reviews 

 of some new plants described by me in the same publication a few months 

 previous. I left Philadelphia prior to the appearance of Dr. Gray's papers, 

 being employed by the Sanitary Commission at Washington to make scientific 

 examinations and measurements of Soldiers for anthropological purposes. — 

 See Anthropological Investigations of American Soldiers, by Dr. Gould, lately pub- 

 lished by the Sanitary Commission. At the end of the war I returned to 

 Texas, where I have been ever since. I did not see Dr. Gray's notes till Au- 

 gust, 1867. I have few Botauical works here, and no Herbarium, and have 

 delayed to notice some points in which I think Dr. Gray has not done me jus- 

 tice, in hopes to be able to have a better chance than I have here, but as 

 time is passing I will offer what facts I have now, leaving others for another 

 opportunity. 



During 1859, '60 and '61, I made a large collection of rare plants, in Geór- 

 gia, Alabama. Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, which I had boxed and started 

 with for the North prior to the war. These were stopped and destroyed at 

 Lavaca, Texas. They were intended for, and directed to, the Academy of Na- 

 tural Sciences of Philadelphia. 



The few I saved I brought with me, but I found the Herbarium of the 

 Academy not as complete as I supposed. I expected to find ali the plants 

 which Nuttall had described, as well as full collections of Wright and other 

 botanists who had explored Texas and other southwestern parts of our coun- 

 try. But these were not as full as I imagined, and the Library was deficient 

 in some works which would have aided me in my investigations. I appreci- 

 ate these facts more fully now, than I did then, and can understand howvery 

 likely it is that I have made some mistakes. There are very few botanists 

 who have not had to regret similar errors under similar circumstances. In- 

 deed the object of this paper is to show that Dr. Gray himself has fallen into 

 error in many particulars in the papers in which he criticises mine. For in- 

 stance, Clematis Texensis, Buckley, Dr. Gray sayg is his " C. viorna var. cocci- 

 nea, PI. Wr. 2 p. 7, C. coccinea, Engelman." It is referred to C. viorna with 

 the remark that its " leaves are more glaucous, and the thick sepals of a puré 

 carmine red, very rarely purplish." I do not know that Engelman has ever 

 published his name of O. coccinea. I believe ali that has been published is in 

 the extract quoted. If, therefore, it is, as I have no doubt the majority of 

 botanists will agree with me that it is, a distinct species from C. viorna, my 

 name has the right by priority of publication. It grows in the vicinity of 

 Austin.

Zanthozylum hirsutum Dr. Gray thinks but a variety of Z. carolinianum. 

 There is a variety I know, and I suppose tbis is to what Dr. Gray refers. I 

 am very familiar with it. It is abundant in the vicinity of Austin. But tbis 

 is always small, the largest specimens with a trunk rarely exceeding three 

 inches in diameter. This was a small tree, one foot at least in diameter, and 

 attracted my particular attention by its very peculiar appearance, as I rode 

 horseback in the vicinity of Corpus Christi. Its hairy leaves are a constant 

 and distinctive character. I expect to get specimens again. 



Ampelopsis heptaphylla Dr. Gray says is " a small leaved state of A, quinque- 

 folia, with some of the leaves 6-7 foliate." They are ali, or nearly ali, 7 foli- 

 ate. If A. quinqaefolia were known to be variable in respect of the number of 

 leaflets on the same plant, there might be room to look for a variety with 

 another number of leaflets. But this species is noted for the regularity with 

 which it bears five leaflets only, both in the north and in the south. It grows 

 in the same locality with my A. heptaphylla, constantly with five leaflets only. 

 But this is not ali ; my plant not only has 7 leaflets almost constantly, but 

 they are smaller than A. quinquefolia, and it flowers in cymose panicles at the end 

 of April ; while A. quinquefolia has compound racemes 3-4 inches in length, 

 and does not open its flowers till the middle or end of June. 



Vitis monticola, he says, is V. rupestris of Schule. In Plantce Lindh. 2, p. 166, 

 Dr. Gray himself says of V. rupestris, " It does not climb, but the stems are 

 upright, and only two or three feet in height." This is right. I am familiar 

 with it. But my V. monticola does climb, sometimes to the height of 15 feet. 

 But in addition to this there is nearly two months diference in the time of ripen- 

 ing of the fruit. Ali the innabitants of this region readily distinguish th em 

 as difíerent things. 



Vitis Lincccumii he refers to V. labrusca, and says that "the Louisiana 

 specimen (of Dr. Hale) exactly agrees with what we formerly cultivated in 

 Cambridge Bot. Garden as the Isabella grape." The Isabella grape is well 

 known here, yet this is readily distinguished by the people of Texas, who 

 call it the " Postoak grape." It has larger and less lobed leaves than the 

 Isabella. The Isabella has naturally but one short bunch — this is shoul- 

 dered or branching; the berries drop easily from the stems — these are strong- 

 ly adherent ; the skin is rather thick and the berries comparatively large, — 

 while these are thin-skinned and smaller. The V. labrusca is a rampant spe- 

 cies, this rarely grows 15 feet, and often bears fruit on bush like specimens, 

 3-4 feet high. I have studied both species very closely, both before and 

 since Dr. Gray's criticisms, and can have no doubt of their distinctness. 



Vitis mustangensis Dr. Gray says " is not the mustang grape of Florida, but 

 is the well known V. candicans of Engelman." He asserts further that V. coria- 

 cea, of Shuttleworth, is a thick-leaved form of it, the V. caribsea of Cbapman, 

 whether of DeCandolle I am still uncertain." I believe the only description 

 of V. candicans published, before my description of V. mustangensis, is the fol- 

 lowing from Plant. Lindh. 2, p.^ 166, where Dr. Gray says, u Under the name 

 of V. candicans (N. S.) Engel. ined., I have from Lindheimer, as also from Mr. 

 Wright, Texan specimens of what appears to be a variety of V. californica, 

 Benth., with the leaves somewhat less dentate, and more densely tomentose 

 underneath." Again, in Plantce Wrightiana, p 32, in a note at the bottom of 

 the page, he states, " Vitis candicans, Engel. ined., which is also the V. coriacea 

 of Shuttleworth, PI. Rugel. ex. sic. from southern Florida, is not the same as 

 Vitis californica, Benth., to which I was disposed to refer it in PI. Lindh, 2, p. 

 166. Perhaps it may be V. caribsea of D. C." If this is, as I believe, the only 

 description of V. candicans ever published, is Dr. Gray justified in terming it 

 " well known ?" Surely Dr. Gray does not own to much acquaintance with 

 it, and makes no allusion whatever to its native name "mustang." 



Dr. Gray " warns the reader that mustang is not the name of a town or 



[Dec* 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 137 



country, as the termination ensis would imply, but of a wild horse." I may 

 add that it is also the name of a stream along which this grape grows in 

 great abundance. 



Isaw Lindheimer at NewBraunfels in Texas in 1860. He told me that Gray 

 and Engelman, with whom he was in close correspondence, were both uncer- 

 tain about this grape, and that it was still undescribed. He regarded it as 

 " scientifically unnamed." Under the rules of priority of description, I claira 

 my name. 



It is unlikely that my mustang grape is the V. coriacea of Shuttleworth, 

 for be it remembered I had travelled extensiv«ly in Florida, and should have 

 seen this grape there if they had beeu the same, but I never saw it in Florida; 

 but the greater probability of this is tbat Chapman, who had resided in Flo- 

 rida 25 years, describes no such grape as mine, but refers the V. coriacea of 

 Shuttleworth to V. caribcea, D. C, and further says the mustang of Florida is 

 tkform of V. vulpina. See Flora of Southern States, p. 71. 



Vitis bipinnata, with which name the authority of " Torr. & Gray" is asso- 

 ciated, belongs really to Wildenow. 



Astragalus Brazoensis, Dr. Gray has, on a second examination, done me the 

 justice to declare a good species. 



Hoopesia arbórea I am charged with " making up from a flowering speci- 

 men of Cercidium texanum, Gray, a fruiting one of Acácia Jiexicavlis, Benth, and 

 a sterile branchlet of Acácia rigidula, Benth." Of course, no one would sup- 

 pose I would mix planta purposely with the object of making a new genus or 

 species. That no such a mixture was possible, I claim from the following 

 facts. I was careful to select a large number of specimens with bothflowert 

 and fruit on the tame branchts. I also cut from sprouts which grew up from 

 the base of the tree, so that I rnight have ali its characteristics, for I felt then 

 that it would prove to be undescribed. I spent a long time in getting these 

 specimens. I was then engaged with Dr. Shuraard in the geological survey 

 of the state. Drs. Shnmard and Riddell were then with me, — they in a 

 buggy, I on horseback — at Corpus Christi together, and we started next day 

 for Austin, my press and plants in the buggy. They went on hurriedly, agree- 

 ing to change my plants, I arrived in Austin three days after them, and 

 found my plants mostly spoiled.. I saved only a few damaged specimens of 

 Hoopesia. Familiar as I was with them in cutting, and again in my anxiety 

 so few days after to select from the damaged specimens the best left, 1 do not 

 gee the possibility of any mistake ; but intend to take the first opportunity to 

 visit again the locality, and get specimens for the Academy and other public 

 institutions. Trees of the Hoopesia grow on the banks of the Gulf, from one to 

 two miles below Corpus Christi. 



Drejera parviflora and Morus microphylla are admitted to be good species. 



Juncus filipendulus has also, since Dr. Gray's criticisms, been decided by 

 Dr. Engelman to be a good species. But he has chauged the name, on the 

 ground that my name is " inappropriate." My name was suggested by the 

 thread-like hanging stems of its fruit and flowers. Even were the name less 

 appropriate than it manifestly is, if botanists had a right to change names to 

 accord with each compiler's sense of fitness, how many synonyms should we 

 not have ? 



Juncus diffusissimus Dr. Gray says is J. debilis. Dr. Engelman has since de- 

 cided Dr. Gray to be wrong in this, but I have not Dr. Engelman'g monograph 

 by me to refer to what he decides it to be. 



Cyperut Heermanii is not referred to any other species, and 



Eleocharis microformis, though said to be " near intermédia," is probably a 

 good species also.

For want of books and material, as I have before remarked, I am unable to 

 follow up these corrections further ; but finding myself right in so many which 

 I have been able to reconsider, I hope to be able to clear myself from someof 

 the other charges in future. 



Dr. Gray was particularly severe in bis preliminary remarks. He accuses 

 me of a " gross appropriation and suppression of the nanies of Nuttall and 

 others, as recorded in a public herbarium." The laws of botanical nomencla- 

 ture say " a name which has never been clearly defined in some public Journal 

 or work, shall be changed for the earliest name by which the object shall have 

 thus been defined." See Edinburg Philosophical Jour.. 1863--4. Indeed,inthe 

 language of science, a plant has not been named until it has been described in 

 some "journal or work.'" One may by courtesy adopt a name he find3 on a 

 label attached toa herbarium specimen ; butif in his opinion, from thesmall- 

 ness or imperfection of the specimen, or from other reasons, he bolieves the 

 interest of science would be served by the use of another name in his de- 

 scription it is his duty to do so. 



I feel that I have been wrouged by Dr. Gray's personal remarks in his re- 

 view of my papers. Considering such a course out of place in a scientific dis- 

 cussion, I havcavoided anything like retaliation. Hut I have thought it due 

 to me as the author, and the Academy as the publisher, of the papers criti- 

 cized by Dr. Gray, that no more errors shonld be laid to their charge than 

 they legitimately deserve. 



A New Classification of the Korth American FALCONIDJE, with Descriptiona of 

 Three Kow Bpecies.* 



BY ROBERT RIDGWAY. 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 



Having been engaged for a considerable time upon an investigation of the 

 North American Falconidte, I have found it necessary to arrange the sub- 

 families with their sectious, the genera and their aubgeneric divisions, in a 

 manner somewhat diíferent from the classification usually adopted. The fol- 

 lowing scheme is intended to express the arrangement that I have been led to 

 make, as the result of the study alluded to. 



Of course, the classification presented is based entirely upon the externai 

 anatomy, and may, very probably, be found to differ from one founded upon 

 the internai structure. As, however, the former is more convenient for prac- 

 tical purposes, and, moreover, there being no sufficient material at my com- 

 mand for a classification of the second kind, I trust that I may be excused for 

 offering one based upon comparatively artificial characters. In the descrip- 

 tions, every available character has been used, it having first been traced 

 through the group to test its importance. 



The present paper is intended as a preliminary to a "Monograph of the 

 North American Raptores," novv completed, and soon to be published, in a 

 volume of the series of reports of the " U. S. Geological Exploration of the 

 40th parallel," under the direction of Mr. Olarence King. This work is in- 

 tended to embrace full descriptions of ali the species of the order belonging 

 to the fauna of North America,-]- their differences from any analogue of South 

 America or Europe being expressed by a diagnostic table ; in which manner 

 are also distinguished ali the closely-allied species. The different stages of 

 plumage of each species are elucidated in detail, and ali doubtful questions 

 as to the relationship of allied forms or the validity of others are fully dis- 

 cussed, and the complete synonymy given in full.

Subfamily FALCON1NJE. 



Bill strong, its breadth at base equalling or exceeding its height; upper 

 outline of cere rather lower than base of the culmen ; gonys much arched, 

 the chord of the arch equalling about half that of the culmen. Near the tip 

 of the upper mandible is a prominent tooth on the commissure, and near the 

 end of the lower mandible, which is truncated, is a deep notch correspond- 

 ing; the end of the upper mandible is compressed, giving the situation of the 

 tooth an infiated appearance when viewed from above. Nostrils circular, with 

 a conspicuous central tubercle. Orbital region bare ; projecting superciliary 

 shield conspicuous, arched, but not very prominent. Tail shorter than wing, 

 the feathers hard and stiff. Primaries very strong, elongated, tapering rapidly 

 toward their points ; only the first or first and second with their inner webs 

 emarginated. Tarsus never with a single series of transversa scutellae either 

 in front or behind; middle toe very long. 



Diagnoses of generic and subgeneric divisions. 

 A. Tarsus tvilh no transverse sculdlte, but, instead, eovered with numerous irre- 

 gular small scales ; second quill longest ; first always longer than fourth ; 

 only first emarginated on inner web. 

 a. Middle toe longer than tarsus — the lattor Bcarcely feathered below the 

 knee. First quill equal to or longer than third.

 1. First and second quills equal; outer web of second only sinuated ; 

 inner web of first emarginated ; of second, Binuated. 

 Sp. peregrinus, Grnel., and u anatum" Bonap., (= peregrinus var. anatum. 



* This "shield" is formed by the bony procesa of the lachrymal projecting backward 

 over the orbit. In Falconina (only) it consists of a single nan ow process ; in the other 

 Eubfamilies, it is broader, and composed of two separate pieces, with cartilaginous junc- 

 tion. the posterior part or " hinged" plate forming the "shield." 



t The only other American Falconidse, having a similar nostril, are Milvago, Phalcobsenas, 

 and ,perhaps a few other genera, belonging to, or generally placed with, the Polyborins&; 

 they also have the tooth, notch, etc, of the bill decidedly indicated; other charaoters, 

 however, separate them very widely from the Falconivee. 



% Ibycter alone forms an eiception; but the other characters of this genus are eminently 

 Polyborinie.

f The light greenish or yellowish bill in ali the Polybnrinx, induces me to use this ap- 

 parently trivial character, as a diagnoetic one. The distinction between '•Milvinie" and 

 " Polyborinx'''' is by no means well marked, and there are intermediate forms (as Milvago 

 and Ihyctrr) which almost induce me to designate them as sections of one subfamily. I 

 find it difficult, if possible, to diagnose them separately by anything more than merely 

 comparative charaefers. 



X No other Raptorial bird that I have seen ihares with Pandion in this curious feature. 

 Indeed, most of the characters of this gonus are so unique, that it is almost entitled to 

 the rank of a separate subfamily.

 plumage dull earth brown, each feather grayish umber centrally, and with a 

 conspicuous black shaft line. Head above approaching ashy white anteriorly, 

 the black shaft-streaks being very conspicuous. Secondaries, primary-coverts 

 and primaries margined terminally with dull white ; the primary-coverts with 

 two transverse series of pale ochraceous spots ; primaries with spots of the 

 same, corresponding with those on the inner webs. Upper tail-coverts tipped, 

 and spotted beneath the surface, with white. Tail clear drab, much lighter 

 than the primaries, but growing darker terminally, having basally a slightly 

 ashy cast ; crossed with six sharply defined, perfectly continuous bands (the 

 iast terminal) of ashy white. Head, frontally, laterally and beneath — a col- 

 lar around the nape (interrupting the brown above) — and the entire lower 

 parts, white, somewhat ochraceous, this most perceptible on the tibia ; cheeks 

 and ear-coverts with sparse, fine hair-like streaks of black ; nuchal collar, 

 jugulum, breast. abdómen, sides and flanks with a medial linear stripe of 

 clear ochre brown on each feather ; these stripes broadest on the flanks ; each 

 stripe with a conspicuously black shaft-streak ; tibia and lower tail-coverts 

 with fine shaft-streaks of brown, like the broader stripes of the other por- 

 tions. Chin and throat, only, immaculate. Lining of the wing spotted with 

 ochraceous-white and brown, in about equal amount, the former in spots ap- 

 proaching the shaft. Inner webs of primaries with transverse broad bars of

Sully, U. S. A., S. M. Rothammer.) Diífering frora the adult only in degree, 

 Upper surface with the rusty borders of the feathers more washed over the 

 general surface; the rusty ochraceous forms the grouud color of the head— 

 paler anteriorly, where the black shaft-streaks are very conspicuous ; spots on 

 the primary coverts and primaries deep reddish ochraceous ; tail bands 

 broader than in the adult, and more reddish ; the terminal one twice as broad 

 as the rest (-40 of an inch) and almost cream color in tint. 



Beneath, pale ochraceous, this deepest on the breast and sides ; markingg 

 as in the adult, but anal region and lower tail-coverts immaculate; the shaft- 

 streaks on the tibia, also, scarcely discernible. Wing, 7-00; tail, 4-60. 



It is to this perfectly distinct species, that the various citations of "cesalon" 

 from North America are to be referred. It is the bird noticed under that 

 name in the "Fauna Boreali Americana," to the author of which (by whom 

 its distinctness from columbarius was first recognized) we take pleasure in 

 dedicating the species. This bird appears to inhabit exclusively the interior 

 regions of North America, especially that portion between the Mississippi 

 Valley and the Rocky iMountains ; whether it extends into the Middle Province 

 we cannot at present tell. Numerous specimens are in the collection from 

 various points between Texas and the northern boundary of the U. S. — its 

 habitat extending into the interior of British America, as we know from 

 Richardson'3 aecount. The very numerous specimens of the H. columbarius 

 from the same region as that inhabited by the present species, are of the 

 usual style of that bird, and the slight degree of variation manifested in an 

 exceedingly large series of the common species, as noted in its account,* 

 will, we trust. illustrate the wide separation of the two species, even in the 

 most similar stages of plumage.

Adult Male. (34244, Remédios Cuba, Dec. 14, 1863, N. H. Bishop.) Head 

 above puré, fine bluish ash, becoming (broadly) white on forehead ; the 

 feathers with delicate shaft-lines of black. Nape, back, scapulars, rump, up- 

 per tail-coverts and tail rich purplish rufous (almost exactly as in sparverius)] 

 no bars on dorsal region, except a very few across ends of larger posterior 

 scapulars. Terminal band of tail light rufous, -30 in width ; subterminal zone 

 of black, very regular, -55 in width ; lateral feather, with outer web and end 

 of inner, reddish white, the black subterminal band crossing the inner web 

 only ; inner web anterior to this, continuous rufous ; shafts of tail feathera 

 rufous. 



Wings fine bluish ash, like the crown ; middle and lower coverts with a very 

 few elliptical, longitudinal specks or touches of black on the shafts ; seconda- 

 ries passing terminally into white, their exposed basal half puré black; pri- 

 maries puré black, exposed edges of inner webs paler. 



Whole under surface of wings immaculate puré white, with a faint delicate 

 reddish tinge ; inner webs of primaries serrated along the shaft with dusky. 



Forehead and superciliary stripe (broadly and sharply defined against the 

 bluish of the crown,) whole side of the head (including lores and ear-coverts) 

 and entire lower parts, continuous, immaculate, puré white, with a delicate 

 orange tinge, except anteriorly. 



The ''moustache" is but just indicated by some blackish touches, and in 

 fome individuais it is wanting entirely, while in ali it is very restricted in 

 width ; the other black picturas of the head are, however, as in sparverius.

type in having the white of the lower parts tinged, or rather stained, with a 

 beautiful, delicate rufous or almost a salmon-orange. The termiaal band of 

 the tail also inclines decidedly to this color, while the white of the under 

 surface of the wing (particularly towards ends of secondaries and primaries) 

 is tinged with a more pinkish shade of the same. 



Another of Mr. Lawrence's specirnens differs in the clearer white beneath 

 (that is, with less reddish tinge — the pureness and continuity does not vary) — 

 which extends entirely around the neck, giving a sharper definition to the 

 black picturce. The " moustache," however, is almost entirely absent ; the 

 black transverse spots on larger posterior scapulars are rather more conspie- 

 uous, and the terminal band of the tail is more purely white. 



Adult Female. (31984, Cuba, J. Ackhurst.) Generally similar to sparve- 

 rius, but rufous brighter, the bars narrower and less numerous, the nape or 

 upper part of back, and rump being almost immaculate. Tail with ten black 

 bars, these scarcely touching the shaft ; the last is about -36 wide, the others 

 about -16 ; tip of tail scarcely paler than base ; lateral feather with outer web 

 edged broadly with paler or ochraceous white, rufous next the shaft ; immacu- 

 late ; inner web with only 3 or 4 very narrow bars on terminal half. Head as 

 in the male, but vertex considerably tinged with rufous. 



Whole lower parts, including frontal and lateral regions of the head, contin- 

 uous, puré white ; breast with a very faint yellowish tinge ; side of the breast 

 and sides with a few scattered minute elliptical, longitudinal flakes of rusty — 

 more black on the shaft. Whole under surface of the wing white, as in the 

 male. 



Wing formula, 2, 3 — 4, 1. Wing, 7-00 ; tail, 4-T0; tarsus, 1-40; middle toe, 

 •90 ; culmen, 51. 



A Cuban female belonging to Mr. Lawrence is exactly similar. One in the 

 S. I. Collection, from Hayti (42420, Port au Prince, Ju»e 5th, 1860, A. C. 

 Younglove), differs only in less purely black bars, and in utter absence of the 

 moustache. A male from the same locality (43418) is like it in the last 

 respect. 



After having carefully examined quite a large series of Tinnuncules from 

 Cuba and San Domingo, I feel compelled to recognize two distinct species, 

 of which the present is presented as new, although it has frequently been no- 

 ticed ; but only, however, in connection with the sparveroides, with which it has 

 been confounded. The diagnosis will I hope sufficiently explain my reasons 

 for separating these two birds.

reaching beyond tail. General plumage dull dark bistre, darkest on the head 

 above and back ; the posterior lower parts paler and more reddish ; throat 

 and neck much tinged with pale rusty; this obsoletely bordering the feathers, 

 which here have fine whitish filaraents attached to the shafts ; primaries uni- 

 form black. Tail like the rump, but with a more hoary tinge, (not paler at the 

 tip,) and crossed with seven or eight very narrow obscure bars of darker, the 

 last of which is distant an inch or more from the end. Lining of wing dark 

 bistre, much tinged with rusty, this prevalent toward the edge ; under sur- 

 face of primaries white anterior to their emargination, beyond which they are 

 ashy, approaching black at ends ; ashy portion with distant, very obsoleto 

 dusky bars. No white anywhere about the head or neck. 



Wing, 10.00; tail, 5.80; tarsus, 2.70; middle toe, 1.40; inner, 90; outer, 

 1.10; posterior, -80; hind claw, 1-00 (chord) ; inner claw, -91; on front of 

 tarsus, 12 exposed, large transverse scutellae ; only 1-70 of the tarsus exposed. 



This very peculiar hawk is, in ali respects, utterly unlike any other Ameri- 

 can species. So much does it differ in structure, that we do not feel sure that 

 it is not from some portion of the Old World, instead of from Califórnia. 



However, we have searched in vain for descriptions which might apply to 

 it, and have also examined, but without success, the large collection of exotic, 

 as well as American, species in the museum of the Philadelphia Academy. 



We take pleasure in dedicating this apparentiy-new species to Mr. Gruber, 

 the collector and donor of the specimen, this gentleman, who is a zealous 

 naturalist and accomplished taxidermist of San Francisco, havingadded much 

 to our knowledge of the birds of Califórnia, through the frequent contribu- 

 tion of valuable speciraens. 



The following reports were read and referred to the Publication 

 Committee :

[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 151 



Elliotfs Birds of North America, and the remainder were disposed of at auc- 

 tion in New York for $100.00. 



I take this opportunity of agaiu calling your attention to the expediency of 

 selling the valuable Fine Art and literary works now in the Library. If thia 

 plan be adopted the means at the disposal of the Library Committee for pro- 

 curing books absolutely neeessary to the working members of the Academy 

 will be greatly increased. 



Blank forms, for the use of those wishing to apply for new books, hare 

 been prepared by order of the Oouncil, and will be ready for use by the 

 beginning of the year. 



Ali of which is respectfully submitted, 



Edwárd J. Nolan, Librarian. 



REPORT OF THE CURATORS. 



The Museum of the Academy, in charge of the Curators, is in about the 

 same condition that was indicated in the last annual report. The Concho- 

 logical Sectfon continues actively to arrange in order the large cabinet in its 

 care. Other departments remain with but little progress towards arrangement. 



The Curasors reyret to add that nothing further has been done, during the 

 last year, towards completing the suggested plan of providing a new building 

 for the accommodation of the Academy. 



The Curators take pleasure in stating that the proposition, in their last 

 annual report, to make a small charge of admission to the Museum, with the 

 special view of moderating excessive crowds, having, with the authority of 

 the Academy, been put into effect, has been found to meet ali requirements. 

 The charge of ten cents for each person, which was commenced the first of 

 May, is só small as to be an inconvenience to no one really desirous of ex- 

 amining the Museum, while it is sufficient to prevent the crowds, which for- 

 merly were so great an annoyance. At the same time, the income derived 

 from the fees is found to be sufficient to keep the Museum in a proper condi- 

 tion of cleanliness and repair. 



The donations during the year to the different departments of the Museum 

 are as follows : 



Mammals. — A mounted specimen of the Grizzly Bear, one of the Fisher, of 

 Califórnia, and one of the Howling Monkey, from Honduras, presented by Dr. 

 George Hewston, of San Francisco, Cal. Skin and skeleton of the Sea Lion,

 mammals from Alaska, presented by Dr. Geo. Davidson, U. S. Coast Survey. 



Birds. — One hundred and fifty bird-skins from the West Indies, beit;g types 

 of the principal birds of the Antilles ; and nineteen other skins, presented by 

 the Smithsonian Institution. A collection of bird skins from Califórnia and 

 Alaska, presented by Dr. George Davidson. 



Eeptiles and Fishes. — A small collection of lizards and serpents from near 

 Pensacola and Perdido R., presented by Dr. John M. Kollock. A collection 

 of reptileg and fishes from Califórnia and Alaska, presented by Dr. George 

 Davidson. A serpent from Kansas, presented by S. R. Roberts. A Trigono-

Chairman of the Curators. 



REPORT OF THE BOTANICAL COMMITTEE. 



To the President and Members of the Academy ; 



The Botanical Committee of the Academy respectfully reports that during 

 the past year the collections made during the war by Dr. Hayden in South 

 Carolina, and in 1869 in Western Nebraska by the same gentleman, have been 

 named. Almost ali of the species were already in the Academy, but many of 



[Dec. 




NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 153 



them were in other conditions than those which we already have, and have 

 been added to the collection. 



A collection froru Califórnia, presented by Dr. Gibbons, has also been 

 named, and added to the collection. Many of these we did not possess before. 



The collection of Australian plants presented by Dr. Mueller a few years 

 ago, besides scattering collections from Alaska and other parts, have been 

 ali gathered together in their respective natural orders. The cases contaiiiing 

 the general Herbarium of the Academy are full, and numbered consecutively. 

 No additions can be ruade until the whole is re-arranged. The eollections 

 above referred to are, therefore, for the present preserved separate, as a sup- 

 plemental herbarium. 



In the beginning of the year it was found that the plants in the magnificent 

 Shortian Herbarium were being badly injured by insects. By authority of 

 the Curators, Mr. Burk was engaged to poison them. He has since been 

 steadily engaged on the work, which is about two-thirds completed. 



Ali the plants in the collections before alluded to were poisoned before 

 putting away by the labors of Mr. Burk. Thomas Mbbhan, 



For Committet.

The Treasurer's report was read and referred to the Committee on 

 Finance. 



The Report of the Recorder of the Microscopical and Biological 

 Section was received and referred to the Publication Committee. 

 The following is an extract from tbe same : 



The great event in our history as an association, during the year which has 

 just elapsed, was unquestionably the first Annual Conversazione held in the 

 Hall of the College of Physicians, on the 12th of May, with a degree of suc- 

 cess amd satisfaction, not only to ourselves, as hosts, but also to our invited 



1870.] 11 




154 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF 



guests, that has. rarely, if ever, been equaled by any similar scientific reunion 

 before held in this city. 



It was followed early in June by an exhibition of microscopes and micro- 

 scopical apparatus, given to the members of the State Medicai Society, with 

 almost equal eclat, and which probably aided largely to diífuse smong the 

 rural practitioners of our State an accurate knowledge of the imraense strides 

 made during the past few years in the various departments of Microscopical 

 Science. 



The new plan of constituting every alternate raeeting a conversational one, 

 determined upon in accordance with suggestious contained in the resolutions 

 brought forward by Dr. R. S. Kenderdine, in June last, has now been ou trial 

 for about three months, and, although its practical operation does not yet 

 prove entirely without difficulties, it is to be hoped that greater care and fur- 

 ther experience will enable us to derive frora this novel íeature the marked 

 advantages which it seems capable of affording us. 



Before concluding my report I raay advert to the new and agreeable field of 

 usefulness, which has been opened to us through the relations of our parent 

 Academy, with the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington, to wit : the refer- 

 ence of subjects requiring microscopical investigation to our department for 

 examination and report ; indeed, it appears to me that few opportunities of con- 

 ducing towards a wide spread, enduring reputation, usefulness and influence 

 for the Biological and Microscopical Section of the Academy, are more promis- 

 ing than those which invite our researches to matters of national interest and 

 importance, such, for example, as the dust showers which occasionally visit 

 our country. In fact, although in one respect, that of electing honorary and 

 corresponding members, we may labor under certain restrictions on account 

 of our connection with the Academy, so great and counterbalancing advan- 

 tages are derived from this association that, to quote the words of our late 

 Recorder, Dr. Tyson, in his last annual report, " We believe that any attempt 

 to weigh them would result decidedly in favor of such union." 



AH of which is respectfully submitted, 



Jos. G. Richardson, Recorder.

 and devoted much time to the performance of the duty assigned them. They 

 have reason to refar with satisfaction to the above summary of the results of 

 their labors.

BIOLOSICAL AND MICKOSCOPICAL DEPAETMENT 



OF THE 



ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES. 



Jan. 3rf, 1870. 

 Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Eighteen members present. 



Dr. McQuillex exhibited the skull of a hedge-hog, in which, owing to 

 fracture of the left lower incisor, the superior incisor of that side. failing to 

 meet with its antagonist, h&d formed a complete circle, the apex of the 

 tooth penetrating the right upper maxilla just in front of the molars. The 

 right upper incisor also had been fraetured, and the inferior incisor of that 

 side had grown to more than twiee the usual length, and assumed the form 

 of a tusk. The skull of a squirrel was also shown, in which, owing to a 

 similar accident, the superior incisors had formed a complete circle and 

 penetrated the upper maxilla. 



Jan. 11 th. 

 Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Fourteen members present. 



Dr. McQuillen exhibited the pulp of a lower molar, with the vessels natu- 

 rally injected. The principal points of interest connected with the specimen 

 were the dentinal fibrili, which were quite evident under the microscope. 

 projecting from a fragment of dentine. In commenting on the specimen, the 

 speaker stated that these fibrili, which are located in the dentinal tubuli, were 

 first observed some eight or ten jears ago in the human teeth by John Tomes, 

 F.R.S., of London, who regards them as the continuation of the nerves of the 

 dental pulp, and accounts for the exquisite sensibility of the dentine in exca- 

 vating decay from the cavity of a tooth, by impressions made upon these fila- 

 ments. The speaker would not pretend to assert that this was an untenable 

 position, but he inclined to the opinion that the dentinal fibrili are to be re- 

 garded as post mortem results occurring after the extraction of a tooth, and 

 due to the coagulation of the fibrine of the liquor sanguinis circulating in the 

 dentinal tubuli during life. In the removal of pulps from the teeth when de- 

 vitalized by arsenical application, or breaking up a tooth after extraction, he 

 had found no difficulty in separating the pulp from the dentine, which would 

 hardly be possible if the nerve fibres passed into the millions of tubuli in the 

 dentine, or under such circumstances an attachment would be formed ex- 

 ceedingly difficult of separation. 



A large plaster model of an incisor tooth. with a vertical section showing 

 the arrangement of the enamel, cementum, dentine, pulp cavity and pulp, was 

 used in illustration of the remarks. 




Z PROCEEDINGS OF THE 



Feb. 7th. 



Vice-Director W. Pepper, M.D., in the Chair, 



Fourteen members present. 



Mb. W. H. Walmsley exhibited mounted sections of a testicle 

 removed from a so-called hermaphrodite, who otherwise presented 

 the externai configuration of a woman. and who was looked upon 

 in society as a female. The testicle exhibited tubular structure, 

 and was removed at the patient's request. 



Mr. T. W. Starr exhibited a slide showing malformation in a 

 spider, which had eight legs and nine feet. 



Feb. 2Uh. 

 Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Eleven members present. 



Mar eh 7 th. 

 Vice-Director W. Pepper, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Six members present. 



Dr. McQuillen stated that dmring certain experiments with the hydrate of 

 chloral, he had reason to doubt the correctness of the view of Leibrech and 

 B. W. Richardson, that it was decomposed in the blood and converted into 

 chloroform. 



Mareh 21st. 

 Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Thirteen members present. 



Dr. Tyson read a paper on Class or Clinicai Microscopes (see Den- 

 tal Times for April, 1870). 



Dr. Keen had had considerable experience with class-microscopes, and 

 had used them with much satisfaction, even with higher powers than those 

 named by Dr. Tyson. He had shown to his class the amoeboid moveraents of 

 the white blood corpuscle. He was disposed to look more hopefully than Dr. 

 Tyson upon the results to be derived from the use of the gas-microscope in 

 medicai teaching. 



Dr. McQuillen had also used the class microseope largely in teaching, and 

 with satisfaction. He was disposed to think with Dr. Tyson, that the gas-mi- 

 croscope could never be substituted with advantage for the class-microscope 

 in demonstrative teaching, but simply became a further aid, assuming the re- 

 lation of the enlarged diagram, and this not always with satisfaction. 



Mr. Walmsley exhibited a four-inch lens made by Tolles, which 

 possessed a working distance of but two inches. 



He also showed some brilliant fresh-water algre, which had been 

 mounted for a year in ca^bolic acid water, still retaining their color 

 completely. 




BIOLOGICAL AND MICROSCOPICAL DEPARTMENT. o 



April Atll. 



Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 



Eleven raembers present. 



The Corresponding Secretary reported the presentation of a copy 

 of Lieut.-Col. J. J. Woodward's Keport ou the Magnesium and 

 Electric Lights as applied to Photo-Micrography ; illustrated by a 

 number of large photographs. 



Dr. S. W. Mitchell exhibited a slide showing the ova of Bil- 

 harzia Juematobia, believed to cause the intermittent Hcematuria of 

 the Cape of Good Hope and Natal, the speciraen having been for- 

 warded to him by his friend Dr. Harley, of London ; and made 

 some rernarks upou the parasite. 



Dr. James Tyson resigned the position of Recorder, and Dr. J. G. 

 Richardson was elected to the vacancy. 



AprU ISth. 



J. Gibbons Hunt, M.D., in the Chair. 



Eighteen members present. 



Dr. Wm, F. Sorris made a verbal communication in regard to 

 the use of weak solution of nitrate of silver and chloride of gold in 

 the preparation of tissues for microscopic examination, which he 

 illustrated by numerous mounted specimens, &c. 



Dr. Hunt inquired what strength of the solution of the nitrate of silver 

 was employed. 



Dr. Norris replied that his ordinary solution was one-half of one percent., 

 and in answer to a question from Dr. Truman, stated that the chloride of gold 

 liquid was of the same strength. Several members having mentioned that 

 they met with nothing but failures in attempting to employ these processes, 

 Dr. Norris remarked that he was at a loss to account for this want ef success, 

 and believed that if the half per cent. solutions were used in a dark room, 

 and the specimens allowed to soak in glycerine slightly acidulated with 

 acetic acid, afterwards exposing them to the light until sufficiently colored, no 

 difficulty would be experienced. 



Dr. J. G. Hunt exhibited some mounted slides of Sazafraga sarmentosa, and 

 observed that in regard to the B tom ata in plants the general rule is that they 

 are distributed ali over the under surface of the leaves. We find exceptions 

 to this law, however, in some species of Sazafraga, and in S. sarmentosa the 

 stomata are grouped in clusters only, and are not found in the cells between 

 the clusters. In other species of the genus the same peculiarity occurs, but 

 this arrangement of the stomata cannot be regarded as a generic feature, be- 

 cause some of the Sazafrages have these organs distributed ali over the under 

 surfaces of their leaves. 



Dr. Hunt further remarked that the singular amoeboid movemeot so often 

 noticed in the white blood corpuscle seems to be a phenomenon not confined 

 to the animal kingdom. A movement apparently similar may be distinctly 

 observed in the nucleus of the cell of Anacharis alsinastrum, and in the plant 

 the movement appears to be more active than that seen in the blood. 




PROCEEDINGS OF THE 



May 2d. 

 Director S. AV. Mitchell, M.D., ia the Chair. 

 Thirteen members present. 



May 16th. 



Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 



Eighteen members present. 



Dr. J. Gibbons Hunt exhibited a species of the frondose Hepaticie, — the 

 Grimaldia barbifrons. Its sporangia are borne on the ends of pedicels, and they 

 contain spores and elaters of great beauty. The stomata in the heads of a 

 plant open into chimney-like canais built up of cells, and these canais dip 

 down into the tissues of the plant. This family of cryptogams offers to the 

 microscopist many objects of beauty, as well as of physiological interest, when 

 properly studied. 



June 6th. 



Director S. W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 



Sixteen members present. 



Prof. J. H. McQuillex, Corresponding Secretary, read a com- 

 munication from the American Microscopical Society of New York 

 City, requesting an interchange of specimens, and of published 

 transactions as far as possible. 



June 21st. 

 Director S. "W. Mitchell, M.D., in the Chair. 

 Ten members present. 



A letter was read by the Secretary from Prof. Joseph Henry, of 

 the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, submitting a specimen of 

 the Myiarehus cinerascens with a remarkable fungous growth upon 

 its feet, and requesting the opinion of the Department as to the 

 nature of this abnormal formation, to investigate which Drs. Rich- 

 ardson, Allen, and Wood were appointed a committee. 



In the subsequent session for private business, it was resolved, in 

 accordance with resolutions oífered in the report of a Committee on 

 Modification of the By-Laws, R. S. Kenderdine, M.D., Chairman, 

 and adopted after discussion, somewhat amended : 



Ist. That the second meeting in each month be purely conversational, with- 

 out order of business. 



2c?. That the Director appoint a conimittee of five, who shall canvass and 

 arrange the members, so as to bring to the Section at least three instruments 

 at each conversational meeting, in addition to those belonging to the Section, 

 with a few objects of interest for each microscope. They shall also canvass 

 the members, and endeavor to have some subject presented at each meeting, 

 in a short paper, relating to the construction or working of the instrument, or 

 its use in scientific study.

The following paper was ordered to be published : 



Is Atropia an antidote to Hydrocyanic Acid ? 

 BY DR. W. W. KEEN. 



Having been recently called upon, as a member of a comtnittee of the 

 Pathological Society, to investigate the blood of Geo. S. Twitchell. Jr., the 

 murderer (who poisoned himself by prussic acid), my attention was called to 

 the lately asserted antidotal powers of atropia, and I made a number of ex- 

 periments on the subject, the result of which I now report to the Department. 



In the Glasgow Med. Jour., Nov., 1868, p. 70 et seq., will be found an ex- 

 tended analysis of Preyer's recent work on prussic acid (Die Blausaúre, Bonn, 

 1868), which I must quote as authority, as I had not acces3 to the original 

 work. The queetions as to action of the poison on the spectrum analysis of the 

 blood, on its coagulation, on the heart, &c, are foreign to my present purpose, 

 and will be found discussed both in the paper just alluded to and in our re- 

 port to the Pathological Society. (Amer. Jour. Med. Sei. vol. 58, p. 432.) 



Preyer's conclusions, from numerous experiments, are that HCy kills by 

 suffoca.tion induced by three means : 



I o , it stimulates or tetanizes the pulmonary branches of the vagus, so that 

 the respiration ceases. 



2 o , it stimulates or tetanizes the cardiac branches of the vagus (and also the 

 sympathetic ganglia of the heart in some cases), and thus arrests the circula- 

 tion. 



3 o , it acts on the respiratory nervous centre, so that the breathing on being 

 re-established is retarded more and more, till death follows. 



Atropia, he states, has precisely an antagonistic action, and therefore 

 should be and is an antidote. That atropia does have such an action as he 

 has asserted on the circulation, is the conclusion to which Drs. Mitchell, 

 Morehouse and myself carne in studying the antagonism of opium and bella- 

 donna, and published in the Amer. Jour. Med. Sei., July, 1865 ; but that it 

 affects the respiration is contrary to our experiments at that time, and that it 

 aets as an antidote to prussic acid my present experiments, so far as they go, 

 certainly disprove. 



Preyer states that if the 0-015 of a grain — i. e.,one millegramme— of sulphate 

 of atropia be injected under the skin of a rabbit, a lethal dose of HCy may be 

 given without producing death ; or if the HCy be first administered, that then 

 the atropia will arrest its poisonous action if it is given quickly enough. 



Exp. I. May 12, 1869. Injected 0-017 gr. of sulph. atropia under the skin of 

 the back of a rabbit, followed in half a minute by 3 Tfy of officinal dilute hy- 

 drocyanic acid. 



In \\ minutes after the last injection he fell over convulsed; opisthotonos. 



In l\ minutes pupils began to contract. 



In õ| minutes respiration had ceased; heart still beating. 



In 6| minutes, dead. 



On the post mortem examination, made immediately, the heart was found to 

 present the slight rythmical twitching usually noticed in the right auricle 

 after poisoning by HCy, but here observed in the walls of ali the cavities sare 

 the right ventricle. 



Exp. II. Injected as before under the skin of a rabbit gr. 0-010 atrop. sulph., 

 followed in half a minute by 2 TTJ. HCy. 



In 1\ minutes respiration arrested. 




b PROCEEDINGS OP THE 



In 3£ minutes re-established, 16 in the minute ; spasms ; cry ; heart beating. 

 In A\ minutes, respiration ceased. 

 In 5| minutes, pupils contracting. 

 In *I\ minutes, heart ceased ; dead. 

 Heart twitching as in Exp. I. 



Exp. III. Injected as beíbre 0-015 gr. atrop. sulph., followed in half a 

 minute by 2 minims HCy. 



In £ minute, respiration rapid. 



In 1 minute, pupil contracting. 



In \\ minute, opisthotonos very severe. 



In 2 minutes, respiration 32, and labored. 



In 3 minutes, respiration stopped. 



In 5 minutes, dead. 



Exp. IV. Injected the HCy first, 3 minims. 

 In 1| minutes fell over in convulsions. 

 In 2 minutes gave 0-015 gr. atrop. sulph. 

 In 2J minutes, gasping very slowly. 

 In 'ò\ minutes, dead. 



Besides these, I also performed four other experimenta, in which larger 

 doses were used with the like result, as follows : 



Exp. V. Injected gr. 0-2 atrop. sulph., followed in half a minute by 10 

 minims HCy. Death in A\ minutes. 



Exp. VI. Injected gr. 0-2 atrop. sulph., and in half a minute 5 minims 

 HCy. Death in 4 minutes. 



Exp. VII. Injected gr. 0-1 atrop. sulph., followed in half a minute by 2 

 minims HCy. Death in 6£ minutes. 



Exp. VIII. Injected 0-063 gr. atrop. sulph., followed in half a minute by 

 1 minim HCy. Death in 10 minutes. 



That the rabbits did not die as the result of atropia poisoning, I take for 

 granted, inasmuch as very many experiments on ali sides prove them to be 

 unaffected by belladonna in any form, as much as 2 grains of atropia not hav- 

 ing produced death. Their peculiar insusceptibility to atropia therefore 

 eliminates a difficulty often felt in similar experiments, — viz., to test which of 

 the poisons killed. It may be objected, then, that as atropia does not act on 

 the rabbit, it cannot be expected to act as an antidote here. Preyer, however, 

 asserts that it does act as an antidote in the case of rabbits, and if proven 

 here, it must a forliori hold good in other animais who are more susceptible 

 to its influence. But in order to test this question, I performed the following 

 experiments on dogs : 



Exp. IX. Injected gr. 1-10 atrop. sulph. under the skin of a small dog, fol- 

 lowed in half a minute by 10 minims HCy. In 2 minutes he fell over with 

 marked opisthotonos, slow and labored respiration, and was dead in 8J min- 

 utes. 



Exp. X. Injected 1-10 gr. atrop. sulph. under the skin of another dog of 

 the same size, followed in half a minute by 7£ minims HCy. Fell over with 

 opisthotonos, as in the former experiment, in 3£ minutes, and was dead in half 

 an hour. 



Exp. XI. Injected 1-10 gr. atrop. sulph. under the skin of a similar-sized 

 dog, followed in half a minute by 5 minims HCy. Death with the same symp- 

 toms in half an hour. 



Exp. XII. 2.31-J P.M. Injected under skin of back of moderate-sized dog 1-20 

 gr. atropiae sulphatis. 2.37^. No effect appearing, injected 1-10 gr. atrop. sulph. 

 2.40. Pupils dilated. 2.41. Injected minims v acid. hydrocyan. dil. (U.S.P.) 



2.45. Seems uneasy ; licks his chaps constantly from the dryness of the mouth. 



2.46. Can scarcely stand. 2.47. Fell down ; howls ; bladder emptied ; breath-

ing laborious ; opisthotonos. 2.48. General convulsions. 2.50. Breathing 

 rapid and laborious. 3.40. Died. 



That the dogs did not die frora the atropia is evident, especially by reference 

 to Dr. Harley's experiments (On the old Vegetable Neurotics, pp. 198 — 202), 

 where as much as one-fourth of a grain was given without producing more 

 than slight poisonous action. 



I do not regard my experiments as sufficiently extended to be conclusive, 

 but as disproving a positive assertion they are of a certain importance. 



On favorable report of the Committee, the following paper was 

 ordered to be published : 



Case of Hypospadias— Male Hermaphrodism. 

 By Prof. Christopher Johnston, M.D., Baltimore. 



u It is with Hermaphrodisms," says Isidore Geof. St. Hilaire, "as with ali 

 other anomalies : as we approach them the marvellous disappears ; but their 

 scientific interest increases, and ali particular facts, bound together by the- 

 ory, explained by simple considerations, present themselves to the observer as 

 the diverse but concordant consequences of a small number of principies 

 which govern the whole domain of teratology. 



"Thus it is, whether we examine the reproductive apparatus of a male 

 hermaphrodite, or consider the totality of his physical constitution, or study 

 him in a moral point of view, we reach the same conclusion, namely, an 

 analogy more or less apparent with the conditions of femininity, but at bot- 

 tom an essentially masculine organization as well as tastes and proclivities." 



These reflections serve very appropriately to introduce the short history of 

 a case of so-called male hermaphrodism, in which, at the age of nineteen 

 years, the subject of it, having been previously looked upon as a girl, was 

 suddenly transformed into a boy by the decision of experts. 



The case is as follows : X. Y., aged nineteen years, is of médium height, 

 fair complexion, bine eyes, brown hair, face feminine, voice puerile and beard 

 sprouting rather thickly for his age and slight figure. His general appear- 

 ance indicates health. It may be added that his gait and deportment are 

 decidedly girlish, for he drops his garments when stripping for examination | 

 and he assures us that he assumed the position of the Vénus accroupie when, 

 as in Father Tom's case, " vesica suasimul erat rumpere." 



He gives of himself the history we reproduce, and which is corroborated 

 by his mother and brother. 



At birth he was looked upon as a girl normally developed, wherefore the 

 age of seven years saw him still in frocks. At this period of his life he was 

 struck by a piece of falling timber upon the abdómen, and, his body under- 

 going investigation in consequence, a peculiarity in the conformation of his 

 outer genital parts was observed, but its nature was not ascertained nor, of 

 course, understood. As he was but slightly injured no connection was alleged be- 

 tween the accident and the abnormal development; and as no importance was 

 attached to his "peculiarity," he was recommitted to frocks and the matter 

 forgotten. He continued to be regarded as a girl, wore the attire of a female, 

 and associated very intimately with girls of the period. As a child he had a 

 remarkably fine voice, a boy's soprano, and was accustomed to sing at public 

 concerts ; but at the age of fourteeu his voice suddenly changed in quality, 

 became piping, and lost much of its original compass. 



A few months ago — as he tells us — his beard began to grow, and this cir- 

 cumstance occasioned him great annoyance, by reason of the remark it excited. 

 Failiog in his attempts to suppress the growth of hair upon his face, and stung 

 by the ill-natured reraarks its presence evoked, he lopped oíf his long braids, 

 assumed the habiliments of a man, and fled from his maternal roof. It would 

 also appear that this conclusion was assisted by the opinion of a medicai 




8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 



gentleman, to whom, suspecting his proper sex, he had had recourse in order 

 to satisfy his doubts as to his sexual status. 



Far from his home, chance now led him to our doar, and upon his request 

 we made a satisfactory examination. 



His framework is that of a male. The mammoe are undeveloped, the thorax 

 and limbs quite hairy, and the púbis and genitais unusually hirsute. A me- 

 dian fissure separated two apparent lábia, and, as hair conceals ali else, the 

 impression is decidedly womanly ; nor is that impression altogether effaced 

 by drawing apart the lábia, for the cleft extends deeply, seems to merge into 

 a small vagina, above which a mentus urinarius lies under the arch of the 

 púbis. But higher up a penis appears, one ineh and three quarters in length, 

 by three-fourths in diameter, surrounded by an imperforate glans uncovered 

 by prepuce. A groove extends along the under surface of the penis, and runs 

 back to within one inch of the anus, being about three inches in length. 

 This groove, lined by mucous membrane, is the roof of the urethra, which 

 deepens posteriorly, and is finally concealed by overhauging scrotal pouches. 

 Traction upon these shows its termination in a deeply irabedded meatus, 

 which lies about half an inch anteriorly to a blind fossa about the size of a 

 crow quill in capacity and half an inch in depth. The meatus and cul de sac 

 are comprised in an oval space about an inch in length, bounded laterally by 

 an elevated ridge of mucous membrane, and posteriorly limited by a four- 

 chette. 



The prepuce, dividing on the under surface of the penis, is continuous with 

 bands of mucous membrane, which simulate the lábia minora of the female, 

 and are lost upon the inner sides of the scrota. The proximate surfaces of the 

 scrotal pouches have the character of mucous membrane, are red, vascular 

 and moist, and are traceable into the urethra and vaginoid cul de sac. 



A careful examination with the finger in the rectum and a catheter in the 

 bladder, recognizes no trace of uterus, and the blind fossa which simulates a 

 rudimentary vagina appears to be independent of ali other parta but the mu- 

 cous membrane which fornis its walls. The indications of the existence of a 

 prostate are uncertain. 



A small oval glandular body occupies each inguinal canal, has the form of 

 a testicle, but is softer to the touch. These bodies, lying just within the ex- 

 ternai abdominal ring, are the testicles, which have not descended beyond 

 that opening. 



The sexual feeling is as feebly developed as the externai parts of generation 

 — indeed it is somewhat doubtful if that feeling exist at ali, as the sUtements 

 of X. Y. on this point are vague and unsatisfactory. He asserts that erection 

 of the penis sometimes takes place, accompanied with pain, but the organ 

 follows an unnatural bent — downwards. 



We have evidently presented to us in this case an instance of arrest of 

 development dating from an early period of foetal life. The cleft is the origi- 

 nal sexual fissure ; the corpora cavernosa have united above, leaving the 

 shallow groove beneath ; the glans is imperforate, and the rest of the spongy 

 body is wanting ; and the bladder and rectum are partitioned off from the 

 great inferior or genito-urinary and intestinal cloaca, the fundus of which 

 puts on the appearance of a little vagina. The sex of the individual is mani- 

 festly masculine ; but X. Y. must be regarded as a very imperfectly sketched 

 male, and as affected with hypospadias of a remarkably decided as well as 

 interesting character.

October 3d, 1870.

 Thirteen menibers present. 



The report of the Committee upon the Myiarchus cineraseens was 

 presented, as follows : 



The Committee to wbich was referred the specimen of Jfi/iarc/ius cineras- 

 eens vel Mexicamis, with ' fungous growth of its feet,' forwarded for investiga- 

 tion from the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, report that, although 

 the great changes which have taken placo in the abuormal formation by 

 drying render it impossible to determine with certainty its n ature during the 

 life of the bird, they have been able to recognize the following characteris- 

 ties : Examined with a hand magnifying glass, the adventitious strueture 

 was found to be porous, and to present a cellular appearance closely resem- 

 bling that of a section of mammalian lung which had been inílated and dried. 

 A thin slice immersed in liquor potassa or glycerin and examined with a 

 power of 200 diameters, was seen to be composed of bauds of material reseni- 

 bling fibrous tissue, arranged so as to form alveoli, each about l-150th of an 

 inch in diameter with a wall of l-600th of an inch in thickuess. These alve- 

 oli frequently contained mycelial threads, apparently of some fungus of the 

 Leptothrix type, and occasionally portions of Acari, resembling the A. Sca- 

 bteii, with their ova and excrement. It seemed improbable that this patholo- 

 gical produet was the result of the integument covering the legs and feet, and 

 bearing even a fanciful analogy to the Elephantiari* of human beings ; first, 

 because a transverse section of one of the toes showed the black scaly skin 

 apparently unaltered beneath the fungous growth, which was readily peeled 

 oíf; second. because it covered the rather elongated claws of the bird with as 

 thick and firni a coating as that found upon the adjacent portion of the toes 

 supplied with its modified cuticle ; and thirdly, from the absence of epithelial 

 or other similar cells in the sections e*xamined, even with a high power (1200 

 diam.) Any hypothesis of its being a malignant growth springing from the 

 connective tissue beneath the integument was likewise deemed untenable. 

 not only on account of the circumstances just enumerated, but also because 

 the disease was so symmetrically developed upon both lower extremities ; 

 and your Committee was therefore, with some hesitation, led to assume that 

 the growth was really of a fungous nature, and perhaps bore some slight re- 

 semblance to those comparatively rare alfections of our race, Favus and Tinea 

 tonsurans of the nails. The only fact which militated strongly against this 

 view was that, on burning a small fragment of the abnormal strueture in the 

 flame of a spirit lamp, a decided animal odor was evolved, and a faint cloud 

 of ammonic-uitrate appeared when the smoking particle was brought in con- 

 tact with the vapor of nitric acid. Even this might be readily explained by 

 the existence in the mass of the various animal excretions with which such a 

 dense covering would probably be charged.

November Ith, 1870. 



Vice-Director, Wm Pepper, M.D., in the Chair. 



Nine members present. 



Dr. J. G. Hunt presented the folio wing report in regard to the 

 dust shower, which was accepted, the Committee discharged, and 

 the Corresponding Secretary requested to forvvard the same to the 

 authorities at the Smithsonian Institution. 



The Committee to \yhom the dust, sent by H. A. Cuttiug, and said to have 

 fallen from the air ia Vermont Feb. 12, 1870 ; was referred for examination, 

 make the following report : 



The dust eífervesced under the action of an acid. 



On microscopical examination we find'as follows : 



lst. Much granular amorphous matter. 



2d. Many round or oval granules, perfectly transparent. These disappear 

 when treated with nitrie acid. It is probable that silica forms no part of 

 their composition. 



3d. Spores of fungi or gonidia of some lichen. 



4th. Diatoms. 



5th. Fragments of vegetable cells, too imperfect for identification. 



6th. Cells of coniferous wood — the genus Pinus — having the peculiar de- 

 posit characteristic of these cells absent in spots. 



7th. Other cells of coniferous wood with smaller markings than tho3e of the 

 pine ; five dots in a row and two parallel rows in each cell, and the cells ter- 

 minating transversely and not obliquely as in the pine. 



8th. Many cells of an Alga, resembling red snow, or Protococus nivalis, or 

 Palmei la cruenta, or Porphrydium,, as the unfortunate plant is now called. 

 These cells were in the stage of binary subdivision, well known in that Alga. 



We see no reason to doubt that this dust is the ashes of some burning for- 

 est, which has been sifting the higher regions of the atmosphere with its mi- 

 croscopical fingers, gathering in its transit some recognized organisms and 

 many we could not identify. The distauce it may have travelled we cannot 

 measure, nor is it important. 



To the action of the winds Linuajus ascribes the importation into Europe 

 of the Conyza cserulca of Canada, which now infests the north of France. 



Certain lichens from the mountains of Ásia, taken up by whirlwinds, 

 travei among the clouds and, imbibing watery vapor upon the journey, grow 

 during their peregrinations, until they fali at vast distances from where they 

 started. " This rain of plants sometimes forms on those places a layer five 

 or six inches deep. Men feed upon them, and what they cannot consume is 

 given to the cattle." We have been told by aeronauts that they have seen 

 thistle seeds floating above the clouds. If those heavierfbodies have been 

 carried vast distances, it is not improbable that this fine dust may have fol- 

 lowed a devious and far distant path. 



Your Committee would request Mr. Cutting to send to this Section a copy 

 of his paper on Dust Storms, when completed. 

 AU of which is respectfully submitted.

Dr. Tyson inquired of Dr. HuDt whether the effervescence with 

 acid did not indicate that the dust was composed of carbonates, to 

 which question Dr. Hunt replied in the affirmative. 



November 2lst, 1870. 



(Conversational Meeting.) 



Director S. W. Mitchell, M. D., in the Chair. 



Twelve members present. 



Dr. Mitchell read an interesting account of a case of supposed 

 Guinea worm in a patient from South Carolina, showing the worm 

 itself, presumed to be allied to the Dracunculus, which he intended 

 to present at the approaching business meeting, and make applica- 

 tion for permission to publish the paper in the next number of the 

 American Journal of the Medicai Sciences. 



In the course of the conversational discussion to which this gave rise, Dr. 

 Mitchell stated that a similar case had occurred at the Wills' Hospital some 

 years since. 



Dr. Coates remarked that not very long ago a horse was on exhibition, 

 and had been seea by many medicai geutlemen, in which a worm was dis- 

 tinctly visible within the aqueous humor. He further inquired whether it 

 was known what mode of travelling through the tissues was adopted by the 

 ova in these cases. 



Dr. Holt thought there was little doubt that they made their first entrance 

 into the system in the water used for drinking. 



Dr. Ttsoh considered that their mode of progress among the structures of 

 the body might be somewhat analogous to the remarkable amceboid move- 

 ments of the white blood corpuscles. 



Dr. Mitchell mentioned in this connection a case where a piece of blunt- 

 pointed irou wire was removed at the instep of a patient whose leg it had en- 

 tered above the knee some time before. 



Dr. Coates finally wished to know how the ovum of this parasite could 

 have made its way through the patienfs flesh, been swallowed in the water 

 which she drank, or even existed at ali in her neighborhood, when no other 

 specimen of its kind had ever been known to occur in the State of South Ca- 

 rolina. 



December bth, 1870. 

 (Annual Meeting.) 

 Director S. W. Mitchell, M. D., in the Chair. 

 Fourteen members present. 



Dr. Mitchell requested that the paper of Dr. Priolieu, read at the 

 last conversational meeting, should be referred to a committee for 

 publication, if approved. On motion of Dr. Kenderdine, it was 

 voted that Dr. Leidy be appointed a Committee of one, to whom the 

 specimen and communication be referred. 



Reports of the Recorder, the Corresponding Secretary and the 

 Treasurer, each giving abstracts of the affairs and transactions of 




12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 



the Section in their several departments duriug the year, were read 

 and accepted. 



Dr. Isaac Norris and Mr. Warner were appointed to examine the 

 Treasurer's account, and, after investigation, reported that it was 

 found to be correct. 



The annual elections being next in order, Dr. J. H. McQuillen 

 and Mr. T. W. Starr were requested to act as tellers, and the De- 

 partment proceeded to elect officers for the ensuing year, as follows :

 Dr. J. G. Hunt in the Chair. 

 Seven members"present. 



Mr. T. W. Starr exhibited a slide containing a specimen of a spe- 

 cies of Chelifer, a parasite of the common house fly, strongly resem- 

 bling a scorpion, also one showing scales of the Platessa plana or 

 Flounder, mounted in carbolic acid water. 



In answer to a question from Dr. McQuillen, Mr. Starr stated 

 that his experience in the use of glycerin jelly had been by no 

 means satisfactory. 



Prof. J. H. McQuillen exhibited a remarkable specimen of so- 

 called exostosis at the root of an upper molar tooth from the human 

 uibject, the growth being more than an inch in diameter. Dr. Mc- 

 Quillen gave some account of this curious case, and also showed 

 some specimens of teeth with calciíied dentine, and under the mi- 

 croscope some thin sections of the same.
