A BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND SYNONYMIC CATALOGUE OF THE GENUS ACHATINELLA, BY W. D. HARTMAN, M. D. The genus Achatinella,^ embraces a group of small, beautiful and variously colored land shells, peculiar to the Sandwich Islands.
Mr. Swainson first introduced the genus to the notice of naturalists in Brand's Journal, in 1828, and in 1831 the same author assigned it a position in the systematic arrangement of species, under the above name.
Since that period manj^ new species have been described by naturalists.
Dr. L. Pfeiffer in the Malakozoologische Blatter, and subsequently others have proposed sub-divisions for the numerous and diversified forms embraced by the genus.
In some instances the lines of these sub-divisions are well-defined, while in others they are less marked.
They have been generally adopted by conchologists, as they are found convenient for the arrangement of a collection.
Mr. Thomas Bland says "the distinctions derived from the consideration of the form of the shells are arbitrary, and the limits are not well defined."
His classification of the sub-divisions of the genus, is chiefly founded on the structure of the lingual dentition, "which indicates three groups, a. Partulina and Achatinella h. Newcomhia and Laminella, and c. Leptachatina ; judging from the shells alone, Bulimella and Apex belong to group a, while Labiella belongs to group 6 or c rather than to a."
This arrangement is chiefly in accord with that of Dr. Pfeifler and Mr. William H. Pease, for the details of which I must refer the reader to their several papers.
I agree with Dr. Pfeiffer in eliminating Carelia and Auriculella as separate genera from Achatinella, and I also concur with Dr. Gulick in the opinion that Frickella should be added to Auriculella.
I am also in accord with Mr. Lovell Eeeve in the opinion that the small common shells for which Dr. Gould proposed tho name of Leptachatina, should be removed from Achatinella, as they are mox'e nearly allied to the Oleacinidte than to the Bulimidie, and they differ from Achatinella in being oviparous while the latter are viviparous.
In consequence of the connection heretofore existing be* Although AtiHculella possesses the same form of dentition as Partula and Achatinella, Dr. Pfeiffer has placed it in a separate genus, on conchological grounds, in which I concur.
These minute shells, would seem to have no place in a serial arrangement of the genus Achatinella.
Species marked f are in the author's collection.
tween Achatinella and Leptachatina, the latter has received especial attention in the preparation of this paper, and for the present it has been retained in the genus Achatinella.
In analyzing the species of Leptachatina proposed by Dr. Gould, of which L. acuminata Gld.
was designated as the type, they are found to be divisible into three groups.
In the first may be placed the elongate or cylindrical and semi-transparent varieties, as L. acuminata, striatula and cerealis Gould, gracilis PfeifFer, tenebrosa Pease, terehralis and exilis Gul., and /tfsca Newc.
In the second, the short oval clear and polished varieties, as cingula Migh.
saccata Hartm.
brevicula Pse.
and nitida Newc.
And in the third, the larger inflated and more stout species, as Sartmanii Newc.
M. S. sacclncta, Jumosa, and vitrea Newc, fusca and resinw/a Gul.
together with corneola and pyramis Pfr.
The major part of the species are terrestrial in their habits, while a few are arboreal.
In my examination of the Achatinellse, I have also included the allied genus Aurmilella.
The generic name of Achatinella has been used by all authors previous to Dr. Pfeiffer's sub-division of the genus in Malakozocilogische Blatter in 1854 and 1856.
Owing to several causes the species have been burthened with numerous synonyms, many of which have been hei-ein omitted, to avoid a needless repetition of names.
Their variability in form, age and color, has misled naturalists into the error of multiplying the species, and a change of environment Dr. Newcomb informs us, is known to so alter the appearance of some, as to cause them to be mistaken for distinct species.
A change of environment and malnutrition materially modifies the growth of all animals, and nowhere is it more observable than in the molluscan fauna.
The diflferent appearance of depauperized or aberrant forms of shells is a prolific source of error, and often of embarrassment to the student of natural history, since corrections can only be made by the examination of types in scattered collections.
Mr. Geo.
W. Tryon Jr. in Ms recent books on conchology, has relegated to synonymy many shells heretofore considered of specific value, some of which are doubtless the result of environment or hybridization.
In the early history of the genus Achatinella, naturalists in different parts of the world were engaged at the same time in describing the species, and some of the names then given have only been established by priority of publication.
The application of boiling water to remove the animal, materially alters the color of the shell, changing a green or bright green to a dirty yellow ; and the manufacture of species by scraping, has also been resorted to, to increase the number of commercial species.
Hybridization may have been a factor in the origin of some varieties as occurs in the allied genus Partula.
The preservation of the species in the lower animals is due in a great measure to animal instinct, but where nearly allied species are thrown together, as often happens in the involuntary change of position of Achatinella, or the proximity of broods, as occurs with Partula, hybridization may take place.
It is well known that embryonic young are priceless to the biologist, and since the tissue cells of species evolute from pre-existing germs and do not originate cle novo, the shape of the embryonic or apical fold of each species of viviparous moUusk, should be the true index of a species, except in the case of hybrids, when it would take the form of one or the other of the parents, and would be farther distinguished in the adult, by the form, size and color of the predominating parent, a law always observable in hybrids.
Dr. Isaac Lea has always maintained the importance of the shape of the apical fold, for a correct determination of a species of IJnio, I have said elsewhere, that viviparous hermaphrodite mollusca (being ■cold blooded animals) would probably more readily hybridize than warm blooded, which might in a measure account for the numerous forms and varieties of Unionidse and Strepomatidse in the rivers of the United States.
The late Prof Haldeman believed that liybrid Unios existed, and farther that individuals between Melantho decisa sxnd M. ponderosa Qnj are often found, which look very much like hybrids of these species.
It is well-known that fish, frogs and toads (which are cold blooded animals) hybridize, and recently some species of salmon have been successfully and profitably hybridized.
So far as known the food plants of the Achatinella have no influence in the coloration of the shell ; those species possessing a black, dark or slate colored mantle, secrete a variegated shell, while others with a greenish, bluish, light yellow or flesh-colored mantle, secrete a shell with different shades of yellow.
The varied and gorgeous tints of the shells of Achatinelhe, are probably owing to the action of light and oxygen on the secretions from the glands of the mantle ; the striations and variations of color, are probably due to the chemical composition of a fluid from a different set of glands ; hence the painting of the arboreal species is more bright and pleasing than that of the terrestrial, which are generally of uniform and somber hues.
The surface of all the porphyroid and gaily painted species, exhibit under a glass, waved spiral striae, similar to Partuhe.
These lines commence at the termination of the first one-and-a-half whorls of the apex, which corresponds to their embryonic age.
The apices of some of the Amastra are coarsely plicate, in this respectresembling Laminella.
This is especially noticeable in the elongate species, as A. magna, assimilis, biplicata, Hitchinsonii, turritella and some others which have been classed Avith Laminella by Dr. Pfeifier ; in others the plica of the apex are small Avrinkles, and in A. farcimen, reticulata, tristis, elliptica, and some others, the apex is smooth and rounded, forming a sub-group of Amastra.
A more constant character is found in the species of Amastra being destitute of spiral striae, differing in this respect from the ])orj)hyroid Achatinellse.
The Amastra being ground species and living beneath dead leaves and other debris, when the shells are deprived of the animal and are exposed to the atmosphere, the ejiidermis is more readily detached than in other Achatinelke.
"The facts relating to the geographical distribution of Achatinella, and the development of so large a number of species within the limits of small areas, are very remarkable and interesting, and have presented problems bearing or.
the theories of evolution.
Each island has its own peculiar species, and not only species^ lout its own peculiar types, or groups of species, of similar form.
Again, on islands where there has been a full development of Achatinella, each principal mountain ridge and valley has its own peculiar species which are found nowhere else; the species of each ridge or valley being often connected with those of the next — by intermediate varieties.
Another important fact observed in the distribution of the Achatinella is.
that on a mountain chain with many culminating peaks, the tendency is to divergence of species, while on an individual mass of mountains concentrating towards a single culminating peak, the tendency is to a convergence of species."
"The structure of the Hawaian Islands is volcanic ; and in studying the distribution of shells over them, it is important to note the relative ages of the several islands.
Geologically speaking, Kauai is the oldest ; next in the series is Oahu ; then jNEaui with the adjoining islands of Molokai and Lanai ; and last comes Hawaii, in the southern portion of which volcanic fires are still raging."
" Oahu.
The development of Achatinella on this island, both as regards number and variety of form and color, has been greater than on any other island of the group.
Unlike most of the other islands which have individual mountain masses, Oalm has two true ranges or chains of mountains, a longer and a shorter one, with many independent culminating peaks.
The aggregate length of the two ranges is 50 miles.
The sides of these ranges, their entire length, are furrowed by deep valleys separating lofty ridges.
These valleys and ridges are the home of Achatlnella : each valley and ridge has its own distinct species which are connected with those of the next valley and ridge, by a multitude of intermediate varieties, presenting minute gradations of form and color.
These two ranges of mountains have already furnished 227 distinct described species of Achatinella, the number of varieties has been estimated as high as 800 or 900.
All these species and varieties, are found in an area of less than 120 square miles ; and a considerable portion of the longer range remains yet to be explored.
These species have all the various shapes from globose to conic, ovate and elongate-conical, and present almost eveiy possible shade and variety of coloring, from pure white to jet black, and all the shades of green, rose, yellow, brown and ash ; sometimes several of these colors are combined in one species, either in regular or irregular bands, or tessellated, marbled or zigzaged designs."
"West Maui.
On this part of Maui we have the converse of Oahu.
Its individual mass of mountains, clustering around one common centre peak, 2000 feet higher than any part of Oahu, furnishes only 30 described species of Achatinella, each principal valley and ridge has its own peculiar species or varieties ; but all the arboreal species can be referred to seven leading types, these differ much from the Oahu types, and do not present the same varieties of form or color.
The prevailing colors are white and dark brown with all the intervening shades ot either, plain or variously arranged in bands or zigzaged lines."
" East Maui.
The distribution of Achatinella on this part of Maui is not fully known.
All its mountain gorges and ridges concentrate around the rim of the immense crater of Haleakala, a circumscribing bound of nearly thirty miles in extent.
The almost impenetrable forest on the mountain slopes to the east and south of the crater comprising a belt of twenty miles long and six miles wide, remain unexplored, and its molluscan life is unknown.
The woodlands on the north-west slope of the mountain facing West Maui furnish 29 described species of Achatinella ; but they are the same or unmistakable counterparts of those found on West Maui.
The narrow depression of land between East and West Maui has led many to infer that they were originally separate islands, this similarity of shell-types would seem to indicate that, if ever separate, they must have been united before the development of molluscan life ; otherwise we should expect to find the types of East and West Maui differing as much from each other as do those of Maui and the contiguous islands of Molokai and Lanai."
" Molokai.
The distribution of Achatinella on this island presents some new features not observed on any other island.
The island is forty miles long with a width of only seven miles, it is about one-third the size of Oahu, and like it has a mountain range extending nearly thirty miles through its length.
The range is furrowed on each side by deep valleys.
Some of these mountain gorges are very wide and cut deep into the narrow axis of the island.
The larger ones have proved an effectual barrier to the migration of the shells.
The island is thus divided into three natural sections, and each section retains its own peculiar species without intermingling with those of the next section."
" Molokai furnishes 25 described species which are about equally divided between the three sections of the island, these shells exhibit more variety of form and color than those of Maui, and have peculiarities which separate them entirely from types of other islands."
" Lanai.
Thi» is the smallest and most arid of the shell producing islands.
Its area is 100 square miles, of which probably not over one tenth is suited for the support of mollusks.
The island is, however notable as the home of A. magna Adams, the largest shell of the whole Achatinella family.
Specimens in our cabinet measure I5 inches long, the whole number of species of Achatinella on Lanai is 13, and they exhibit peculiarities of type."
" Kauai.
This is the oldest and most verdant island of the group.
It lies to the west of Oahu, and is separated from it by a channel wider than occurs between any of the other islands.
Its extensive forests, luxuriant vegetation and moist climate render it peculiarly adapted for the abode of Achatinella ; and one would naturally expect to find here a larger, and if possible, higher development of the family.
But we are doomed to disappointment, the island yields no arboreal species, the shells are terrestrial, and those classed with Achatinella belong to the plainest forms of the Amastra and Leptachatina groups; 5 species to the former and 18 to the latter.
Kauai, however, does furnish a very peculiar and interesting group of large terrestrial shells, remarkable for their elongate turretted form.
The generic name of Carelia has been provided for the group; it embraces some seven species.
Specimens of Carelia turricula Migli.
in my cabinet measure three inches long.
This group has no place in the AchatineUa family, as classed by M. Gulick.
It lacks the peculiar spiral twist of the columella and other generic characters of that family ; living specimens of Carelia are now very rare, but at some period in the history of Kauai they were exceedingly abundant.
The alluvial deposits near the coast portions of the island, contain multitudes of these shells in a semi-fossil state, which have been washed from the mountains by the freshets of ages past.
The small neighboring island of Niihau also has a single species of Carelia found in sand and mud deposits ; no living specimens are found there now."
" Hawaii.
This island embraces within its bounds two-thirds of the total area of the whole group.
It is also supposed to be the most recently formed of the islands.
The volcanic forces are still at work here.
The extensive forests are as well adapted for the support of AchatineUa, as those of any of the other islands, but it furnishes only a single arboreal species, and five terrestrial.
The arboreal species is A. physa; it was first described by Dr. Newcomb in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1853.
In a subsequent number of the same Journal, Mr. Wm.
H. Pease refers to this same shell as a "species rarely met with on the mountains of Hawaii."
The centre of production is the Kohala range of mountains, notably the most ancient portion of the island ; and it exists there now in unparalled abundance.
During a recent visit to the locality in a few minutes I collected several hundred specimens, picking them from trees and low bushes as rapidly as one would gather huckleberries from a prolific field.
The shell appears to be slowly migrating into the adjoining districts of Hamakua and Kona, and assuming new shapes and varieties of coloring.
One of these varieties in our cabinet is almost worthy of assignment as a new species.
The conchologist of a few centuries hence will no doubt be naming A chatinella from the difterent districts of Hawaii of manifold forms and gaudy colors, which have developed through the mysterious processses of evolution from the humble A. physa of the Kohala Mountains."
" The discovery of so large a number of land shells of the same genus within limited island areas was unprecedented, and at once induced the belief that the " completion of a collection of the genus had been sealed," this is a mistake.
The homes of AchatineUa are on rugged mountains, densely covered by vegetation and their sides furrowed by deep and almost inaccessible ravines and large districts on Oahu and East Maui wliicli have never been visited by white men, remain yet to be explored.
It will require years of research and study, before the number and exact distribution of the remaining sj^ecies can be ascertained.
It is also generally supposed that these shells are becoming extinct by the ravages of cattle through our forests.
This is true in respect to a limited number of species on the island of Oahu whose habitats were the forests on the lowest range of hills.
Some of these hills have been denuded of woods, not only by cattle, but the woodman's axe, and certain species are becoming rare.
The favorite resorts of many species are the Ki (Dracena terminalis) and the Olona (Boehmeria stipularis) both excellent fodder plants.
But in localities where these plants have been entirely destroyed by cattle, the shells have generally selected homes on other adjoining plants.
The ravages particularly of wild cattle in our mountain forests are certainly to be deprecated, nevertheless by clearing the under brush they render the forests more accessible for the collection of known species ; and by opening the paths to higher and more dense forests they facilitate the discovery of new species.
The agencies now threatening the wholesale destruction of these little gems of the forest are the rats and mice, which have become very abundant in mountain forests, particularly where there are no cattle.
Their ravages are not confined to the shells whose habitats are on the ground, but extend to those found on trees.
It is not uncommon to find around the charnal cells of these noxious little animals hundreds of empty, mutilated shells.
Not^Vithstanding these threatening agencies, the Achatinellffi are still quite abundant on Oahu and Molokai, where cattle have the widest range, though not so abundant as formerly on West Maui where the cattle ranges are somewhat limited and the mice enjoy greater immunity.
In a recent excursion with a friend through a portion of the mountain forests between Ewa and Waialuaon Oahu more than 3000 shells were collected in a few days embracing over fifty species of Achaiinella, some of them new to science.
In a similar trip around Molokai nearly 5000 were collected, embracing thirty species, some new.
"^ To Wesley Newcomb, M. D. more than to any author on Acliatinella, we are indebted for a correct knowledge of the described species of this beautiful genus of shells.
During a residence of nine 1 Mr. D. D. Baldwin in Hawaian Almanac and Annual.
years in the Sandwich Islands he collected and reared large numbers of the different species and observed the numerous varieties from a common parentage.
When in Europe in company with the late Dr. A.
A. Gould he examined the types of Dr. L. Pfeiffer and others which enabled him to correct the synonymy of many doubtful species ; all of which he has embodied in his Synopsis of the Genus, which entitles him to the designation of authority on Achatinella " par excellence."
For convenience of reference I have arranged the species alphabetically under the several sections, rather than in a connected series, as was attempted by Mr. Pease.
The sections of Achatinell^e being more or less artificial, authors are not always in accord as to which certain species should be assigned.
In the majority of instances, I have followed Dr. Pfeiffer or Mr. Pease in the distribution of the species among the sections, being guided in the main by authentic examples, or by figures and descriptions of authors; the sub-section Helicterina adopted by Mr. Pease from Baron Ferussac, has been supplanted by Partulina, the former having been preoccupied.
In the pi-eparation of this paper I am indebted for aid to several friends.
To Prof. A. Agassiz for the loan of the entire Pease collection of Achatinella together with all his duplicates amounting to near two bushels of examples, I have had in my possession several entire suites of Achatinell?e, kindly loaned to me by Prof James Hall, Dr. Lea, Mrs. George Andrews and INIr.
P. Ellsworth Call, by which I was enabled to identify types from authors hands.
Recently, at the invitation of Dr. Newcomb I spent the greater part of two days in the examination of his collection oi Achatinella made some years ago in the Sandwich Islands.
My acknowledgements are also due him for assistance in the determination of many varieties.
When in Europe in 1883 I purchased some of the species of Messrs Gulick and Smith from G. B. Sowerby Jr.
Recently I have been favored by Mr. D. D. Baldwin of the island of Maui with written catalogues of the localities of the Achatinellse of the Sandwich Islands, together with numerous examples of Achatinella and especially with specimens taken from the determined type examples of Mr. Gulick, in the Hawaiau JMuseum.
The geographical distribution of the Achatinella; in those islands together with their habits, which has been embodied in this paper was expressly prepared by Mr. Baldwin for the Hawaian Almanac and Annual.
I am also under obligations to Mr. Geo.
W. Tryon Jr., for his uniform courtesy in aiding me in the examination of books and examples belonging to the Academy of Natural Sciences.

This shell was found at the above locality by D. D. Baldwin, Esq.
of Lahaina Maui, who has devoted much time and attention to the Achatinella of the Sandwich Islands.
He has known of similar examjiles being found at the same locality.
The shell is not quite mature, and at first sight has the facies of an Apex.

Tryon, Jr. on the 5th inst.
having been annoimced the following minute was adopted : — While this may not be the time to fully set forth the services which liave been rendered to this Academy and to the scientific world by our departed member Geo.
W. Tryon, Jr., yet it is fitting that the sad announcement of his death should be followed by immediate though brief expression of our sorrow.
— Therefore be it Resolved — That by the death of Mr. Tryon, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia is bereft, of one of its most faithful and useful workers — one whose devotion to the interests of the institution has been proven during nearly thirty years in varied and responsible positions of trust, by repeated and generous gifts, and above all, by untiring labor for its advancement; and whose earnestness and assiduity in his chosen field of study have been rewarded with a w^ell-earned celebrity which will forever connect his name with the history and progress of conchological science.
Resolved — That we are enabled by our owft knowledge of his kindly, helpful and endearing qualities to sympathize heartily with his fimily in their irreparable loss.
Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger was appointed to prepare a biographical notice of Mr. Tryon for publication in the Proceedings.
Februry 13.
Meeting of the Botanical Section.
The Director, Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger, in the chair.
The death of Dr. Asa Gray, on January 30, was announced and the following minute which had been adopted by the Academy at the meeting held February 7, Avas read : — The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia has lejirned with deep sorrow of the death of Professor Asa Gray of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was elected a correspondent in 1836.
In placing this record in our Proceedings we are unable to give adequate expression to our sense of the great loss which we, in common with 5 the whole world of science, have sustained.
A life extending to nearly four score years has been wholly devoted to scientific investigation, mainly in his chosen department of Botany, in which his labors and philosophic insight have been attended with results that do honor to him and to his country.
In entering upon the study of the flora of his native land, he early realized the imperfect character of its existine: literature and turned his attention to the examination of the original types of various authors as found in the herbaria of North America and Europe.
His ultimate object seems to have been the production of a complete flora of North America, which, though he lived to see far advanced, he was not permitted to entirely finish.
In the course of his studies his far reaching mind found deep interest in the difficult questions pertaining to the geographical distribution of plants, and he was led to the discovery of the remarkable analogies between the flora of the Eastern United States and that of Eastern Asia.
His reasoning upon this and kindred subjects prepared his mind to give respectful attention to the deductions made by Darwin, when they were first published, and though never a blind follower, he was one of the earliest scientists of our land to uphold the idea of progressive development, always maintaining its perfect harmony with theistic belief.
Thus his labors in the botanical field have been utilized for the entire scientific \vorld.
His interest in this Academy never abated ; our library bears abundant evidence of his researches; our herbarium has been greatly enhanced in value by his studies of its types, and by his generous contributions; whilst his kind, genial and attractive presence at many of our meetings has endeared him to us all.
— Therefore be it Resolved — That this expression of our sorrow be communicated to his immediate family with the assurance of our deep sympathy with them in a loss which is so widely felt.
Resolved — That this record be entered .in full upon our minutes and published in the Proceedings.
Mr. Redfield offered at the meeting of the Section, the following preamble and resolutions which were unanimously adopted: — When in due course of nature a man eminent in his calling, conspicuous as a large minded citizen and remarkable for his private virtues is taken from us it is a duty which his colleagues owe, not only to the memory of the departed, but to themselves that they should recognize by public expression the value of so distinguished a life to the times in which it was cast: — Therefore be it resolved, — 1st.
That in the death of Professor Asa Gray, the Botanical Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia recognizes the removal of one who stood without a rival in his chosen field.
The magnitude of his work, the industry and ability with which it was executed, the clearness of insight, the truthfulness and accuracy displayed in all that he undertook, have done more to .elucidate the flora of North America, than the labors of any of his predecessors or cotemporaries.
2nd.
That we desire here to record the fact, that as he was ever ready to aid his co-workers however humble, by his extensive knowledge, his removal is deplored as a loss to the whole scientific community.
8rd.
That w'hile his great intellectual attainments w^ere combined with the charms of a pure life, a warm heart and a charitable disposition Avhich gave a rare loveliness to his whole character, — there were also added an inflexible purpose, an unyielding devotion to duty, and an allegiance to all right principle.
4th.
That we will cherish his memory, and endeavor to follow the spirit and purpose of his life in science, by fostering that fraternal feeling which he did so much to create among the botanists of our country.
5th.
That while we trust that his removal hence is but the entrance upon a nobler field of action, we desire to offer to Mrs. Gray and to other relatives our most profound sympathy in their bereavement.
6th.
That these resolutions be entered in full upon the minutes of the Section, be printed in the Proceedings of the Academy, and that a copy of them be transmitted to Mrs. Gray.
Mr. Wm.
M. Canby in seconding the resolutions said: — One of the most remarkable men of our country and, as a scientist, the best known and most esteemed abroad of any American of our day, has passed from among us.
The early advantages of Asa Gray were not many.
He was not a college-bred man in the ordinary acceptation of the term and his rise was due to his own genius and energy.
It falls to me to-night to speak of him as a systematic botanist.
It is difficult for our younger botanists to comprehend the low state of the science when Dr. Gray first became interested in it.
Nothing of any moment had as yet been done except in systematic botany.
True there had been good workers in this department^ and the labors of Bartram and Marshall, of Walter and Michaux, of Muhlenberg and Elliott, of Schweiuitz, Pursh, Nuttall and others^ have always been highly esteemed.
^lany foreign botanists, from the time of Linnreus onward, had described American species.
The labors of tliese had laid a foundation for Xorth American botany.
But many of the descrij^tions were in diverse and scattered pu1)lications and were often incomplete or faulty.
The synonymy had become much confused.
Vast regions now well known, Avere then terroe incognitie.
Even the flora of so near a district as the pine lands of New Jersey was almost unknoAvn.
Xothing daunted, the young botanist, encouraged by the late Dr. Beck of Albany and yet more by his life-long friend and associate Dr. Torrey, gave up the practice of medicine and devoted his whole time to his tavorite science.
So far as I know he was the first American to fully do this.
Almost at once the eflect of his careful and excellent labor began to appear and much preliminary work was soon done.
Dr. Torrey had seen the manifest need of a new and better "Flora of Noi-th America."
Here was one wdio could not only assist him but take the main burden of the work ; and soon the now classic "Torrey and Gray's Flora" began to appear.
Any one familiar with this work must have noticed hoAV rapidly the descriptions improved as the work went on, and what a vast amount of new material the collections of Js'uttall, Fremont, James and other explorers of our western Territories brought into it.
While the species were thus well studied and the new ones admirably described, the fullest and most generous credit was always given to the discoveries and labors of others.
But collections of the plants of the great western regions, from public and private sources, began to come, in most embarrassing richness.
It became evident that the further publishing of the "Flora" must be delayed until the floral wealth of the great interior could be better known.
It was also necessary that the synonymy of the earlier described species should be settled.
Bo, for a brief period, Dr. Gray studied these in European herbaria and gardens.
Twice afterward he made similar studies with most important results.
Soon after his return from his first visit abroad, came the call to Cambridge and his settlement at the Botanic Garden there.
From this time onward he stood in the very front rank as a botanist.
His energy and industry were unceasing, and Jiis work, by no means confined to systematic botany or to the plants ■of our own countrv, went forward rapidly and well.
Less than a year ago I was told by the Governor of the Fiji Islands that Dr. Gray's work upon the flora of those distant lands was still the foundation of their systematic botany.
His researches into the flora of Jaj)an and China are well known.
Soon the "Manual of Botany" appeared with its excellent arrangement and its clear and accurate descriptions.
Who can measure the influence of that work upon the botany of our country or the effect it has had to create and increase an interest in the science.
At last, after an amount of well directed labor and research which could have been applied by no other man, and after very many "contributions" of new species and "monographs" of difficult and little known genera had come from his pen, the time seemed ri2)e for a real ami comparatively complete "Flora of North America" to appear.
We all know" how two volumes of this were issued and, in a second edition, extended and improved ; and how fondly we had hoped, knowing howunimpaired was his mental and physical vigor, that the whole might have been finished before death claimed him.
This w^as not to be; but we can never be sufficiently thankful that so much which he alone could give was made free to all.
What estimate shall we place upon his work in this department of the science?
None but the very highest would be just.
To me it seems as if the systematic botany of our country owes nearly every thing to Dr. Gray.
Much that he did not do personally was done under his eye or by his advice and approbation.
He it was who broucrht order out of confusion and bavins^ made stable and secure the foundation of this branch of the science, erected thereon a noble edifice Avhich his tireless energy well nigh completed.
But no man could have done this who was less richly gifted than Asa Gray, for he had that clear insight and prescience which is genius rather than talent.
In him, with eminent ability to detect the relations of genera and species, were combined a rare faculty of conveying his own knowledge to others by felicitous and accurate description, and the conscientious truthfulness which would allow no work to be carelessly or incompletely done.
Would that it were my place also to bear testimony to his greatness of soul.
But this I must leave to others, — only saying, what all will recognize as true, that in the death of Dr. Gray we have, in the largest sense, lost the best as well as the greatest of American botanists.
Prof. J. T. RoTHEOCK then saiil : — I desire here to speak of Asa Gray simply as a teacher, and shall not allude to his rich and rounded career in any other relation, except so far as may be required to bring out the teacher more fully.
His work as a systematist will receive fuller and better consideration from others, than I could hope to give it.
Directly or indirectly almost all the botanical teachers and investigatoi's of this country owed their training, or their inspiration to Professor Asa Gi'ay.
If they had not been directly trained under his eye, they Avere at least taught by those who had been, or luid used the text-books prepared by him for the special purpose of diffusing a popular knowledge of botany.
Two of his least pretentious books, — "How Plants Grow" and "How Plants Behave" are veritable missionaries which daily impart some worthy lesson to thousands of children all over the land.
We can hardlv think of a time when these books will cease to be read, or to be popular.
In each generation there are a few men to whom "the world owes its most notable impulses."
One may well say that the life and labors of Charles Darwin illustrate this statement fully ; and with equal propriety we may claim, that so far as our own country is concerned, the teaching and example of Asa Gray were no less noteworthy.
There comes a time in the history of almost every ambitious youthr bent upon an intellectual life, when he is called upon to decide what special career he will select.
His earliest ambition to become a master in the whole realm of knowledge is found to be woi^se than a dream.
His first intention was to have devoted a year to one celebrated instructor and another year to a second, and so on, until he should lav the broad and soKd foundation upon Avhich his great learning and reputation might rest.
I have known such ambitious students, and I have known them to become pupils of Professor Gray, with the ftdl intention of leaving him at the end of a year or two, to seek instruction in another department of Science, from another teacher: but of that number, very few ever completed their proposed course of study.
The charm of Professor Gray's manner, his kindness of heart, no less than the constantly widening views which unfolded under his instruction, Avedded them to botany for life.
Yet I neA^er knew him to say, or even intimate, that one should elect hU branch OA'er anothers.
There have been students to Avhom botany Avas far from a favorite branch, but in less than six months, tlie great, warm-hearted teacher had won the pupil to himself and to botany forever.
Had Asa Gray been a man of but medium attainmenis, his transparent and unselfish goodness would alone have made him a model teacher, whose example and whose memory a student must have revered to the end.
Yet of all this personal power which Gray the teacher wielded, not a trace was due to toleration of half done work.
On the contrary if he had a characteristic which absolutely predominated, it was thoroughness.
Not once in years did I ever know him to rest satisfied until he had obtained from a pupil the best results possible under the circumstances.
From the outset he not only encouraged, but required a student to see, think and conclude for himself: often without aid from books and always without unnecessary aid from him.
This may appear to many as harsh treatment, but systems of teaching can only be judged by their result, and in this light Professor Gray's method stands abundantly vindicated.
How wretched the system of education which "crams" a lad with facts and leaves him unable to stand alone when beyond the authority of the preceptor.
To the fullest extent Doctor Gray recognized this, and to prevent such a result insisted on mental discipline which left the student with a Avell-grounded confidence in his own powers.
But on the other hand a student never could learn presumptuous trust from a teacher who had nothing of the kind himself Those who received from Professor Gray the largest share of judicious "letting alone" were the ones disposed to hunt an easy solution to their problems.
It was never enough to simply reach a result in work.
His common custom Avas to question and cross question until there could be no doubt in the mind of either teacher or taught, that the result Avas fairh^ obtained.
Often the conclusion of the student Avas treated as a thesis to be sustained.
Dr. Gray not seldom assigned to his advanced students, subjects for original investigation and of course required a Avritten report, often for publication.
Nothing shows more clearly his conscientiousness as a teacher than his strictness concerning these reports.
It Avas not sufficient that the conclusions should be correct, but they must be stated in exactly the right Avay.
An artistic turn of a sentence, making it graceful as avcII as logical, was in his CA^es of the utmost importance.
"There noAv, that is neatly stated," is an expression Avhich yet rings in my ears.
It was uttered by Doctor Gray, when at last I had succeeded in "putting a point" as he thought it should be.
1 had written my first tscientific paper at least six times, and each time thought it was as well done as could be; certainly as well done as I was capable of doing it.
But my critic was merciless.
I mentally resolved each time, that I would not re-write it; but I did re-write it ; and was obliged to continue doing so until he thought it might be allowed to pass.
I can see now the benefit of all that criticism.
It was the most helpful lesson I ever received in the art of stating things.
How much easier it would have been for Professor Gray to have made a mere perfunctory criticism, and then allowed the paper to have gone, with the statement, — it will do, but it should have been better!
The fact that he did not do so, however, is just the point that I desire to bring out in illustration of his conscientious discharge of duty.
I have no doubt he sighed more over having to take time to re-read it, than I did over having to re-write it.
But, though to him lost time, he was good enough to regard it as a duty, and as such he did it.
His chai-acter as a teacher came out in the fact that he did not allow it to ])ass.
It was this disregard of his own time when a duty to a student was apparent, which jjlaces him now so high in the esteem of scores of ])upils.
During working hours Professor Grvj would allow no talking for talk-sake, at least but for a moment.
He would, howevei', volunteer a hint, to place a student on the track in a difficult problem, or if necessary he would cheerfully give an hour for the same purpose, though he would not reveal anything which it were better that the student should discover for himself So far as I am aware he never forgot or lost interest in any one whom he had instructed.
This is certainly true of those who had spent any considerable period with him.
Time and time again, have I known him to be on the watch for a chance to help a student make an honorable name.
Is it strange then that all over the land there are those who have heart aches when it is remembered we shall see that loved teacher no more?
When a great, good leader has been taken it hardly alters the case that he went full of years and honor.
We are even then not ready to spare him.
We never would have been ready to spare Asa Gray.
Each year the aspect of a science changes and some new phase becomes the popular one : and this for the time being is apt to be regarded, as, if not the whole, then at least as the better or the major part of the science.
It is simply the expression of an old human 1888.]

fi5 weakness, which tries to make a part appear greater than the whole of a thing.
An individual of great force of character, may if he desires, impress his associates with an idea of the supreme importance of his i)articular, partial line of study.
But after all we only discover the solid bulk of anvthiug when it is viewed from all sides.
This is intended to hear especially upon the fact that Professor Gray's teaching lay mainly, but by no means exchisively in the line of systematic botany.
Just now there is a decided tendency to give more attention to morphological and })hysiological botany than ever before, which is right ; and to discourage systematic botany, which is wrong.
It is merely a temporary swing of the pendulum.
Gravity will at length place all these lines of botanical thought, as they deserve to be, on an even plane.
It should, however, be said that those who disparage the systematic side to which Doctor Gray leaned, and on which he mainly taught, have as a rule had so little training in it, that they fail to comprehend its full meaning.
Even mere analysis of a plant may, nay must, if properly taught, indicate beside the name, those broader relationships which express, or suggest the lines of descent by which the plant has come down to us.
If it is a grand study, and it surely is, to follow the development of the individual from the egg or cell to the adult condition, is it not a much grander and broader problem to follow the evolution of the species or the genus ?
Further, it should be stated that Professor Gray's work and teaching was directly in the natural sequence of events.
Above all, it is to be remembered that the most timely work is ahvays the most valuable.
The first, most pressing task in the botany of any country is to correctly name and arrange its plants.
This is a pre-requisite condition upon which the record of all other botanical studies then, and the diffusion of all know^ledge thence, must rest.
J t was to the completion of this great, this necessary work that Professor Gray was bending all his strength.
It is well, however, to come to the clear statement, that no one in America, and but vexy few in Europe were so fully and practically acquainted with the latest thought and latest observations in all departments of botany as was the subject of this sketch.
He could discuss just as clearly the functions of chlorophyll, or the dual nature of lichens, or the relation of a plant to its environment, as he could the relation of one American species to another, or of an Eastern United States plant to one from far away Jai)an.
Let it then be stated, that judged by the broadest standard, as a teacher, Asa Gray stood perfectly rounded in his knowledge.
If any one can doulit this, let him but read the critical reviews which during the ])ast twenty years Professor Gray has written for the American Journal of Science, and be convinced.
Indeed the wide range of his exact knowledge was wonderful.
But vast as were his attainments, and vast as was the sum of all that he has written, his strongest claim to a perpetual remembrance does not rest there.
His was the task of starting a generation of teachers in the right direction.
True, the times were ripe for the coming of Professor Gray; but how nuich more meagre the harvest would have been if he had not come I Certainly it could not have been what his care and culture have made it!
It is a great thing to write a good book.
It is a greater thing to write a clearer book for a country than had been produced before.
But it was greatest of all, to take the young, ambitious naturalists of this growing and educationally immature country and teach them how to teach others, not only as to facts, but as to methods.
The value of this labor passes comprehension, for its ultimate effects ever widening, reach far out into the future.
Facts may be lost sight of, theories disproven, hypotheses rejected as insufficient, but men will henceforth never lose a key Avhich unlocks realms of knowledge.
Asa Gray's whole life as teacher and as investigator has been the model of a master key.
Those who have his patience, his honesty, his genial fiiith in his associates will best unlock the secrets of our flora so long as any remain unrevealed.
Tliink of him in what relation we may, he stands out in strong light for inspection, the picture of a "manly man.''
Was he without fear?
It was because he was without reproach.
If to the last, his cheerfulness and mental buoyancy anuized even those wiio knew him best, it was because the elasticity of his love of God and man enabled him to reach beyond the limits which age usually imposes, clear into the sunlight of eternal youth.
Asa Gray has gone to his rest.
We mourn his removal from our midst : but we are thankful for the honor he cast upon this land, throughout the length and breadth of which his name is revered.
More than this, we his associates and puj)ils are especially grateful for the example of kindness and conscientious devotion which he has left us ; as well as for the methods of study which he inculcated and so well illustrated in his own daily life and labor.
Prof. W. P. Wilson said :— I wish to offer a few words on the relation sustained by Dr. Asa Gray to the various leading scientific societies and naturalists of the old world.
I do this all the more gladly because like some others of our true scientific men he was known better abroad than in his own land.
I do not wish to say that Dr. Gray was not well known at home, for he Avas.
His series of text-books, eight in all, has introduced his name Avherex'er botany is Avell taught, but had hi& celebrity in this country depended on his scientific papers and books not intended for the general reader, he might have been almost a& unknown to the masses as Jeffries Wyman, who wrote no text-books but made some very important additions to science and consequently was much better known in England and on the Continent than here.
In this country, to the great majority of individuals who had seen or heard of Dr. Gray, his name was inseparably connected with the finest set of text books ever issued in the English language.
Only a few botanists and friends knew of his incessant labor on original questions, and that the results of this work were frequently published in the proceedings of the difl^erent societies.
It was this latter kind of work which rapidly gained for him abroad a great recognition.
While Dr. Grav in his early career labored incessantlv at his chosen work, went on numerous collecting tours, prepared important papers on the Grasses and Sedges, gave lectures on botany in two or three schools and colleges, published several minor papers in different societies and made himself indispensable in the early work of the Flora of North America Avhich Dr. Torrey had already begun — he was known only to a vei'y limited circle at home.
This activity, accuracy and ability in botany had already made him through his collecting and papers quite a reputation abroad and had as early as 1836 secured for him membership in three foreign societies: The Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm in 1829, the Imperial Academy Naturse Curiosorum, Warsaw, 1885, and the Royal Botanical Society of Regensburg (Ratisbon) 1886.
Dr. Gray's visits to Europe were in all six.
He first went for botanical study in Xovember 1838, returning in the November or the following year.
The progress of the North American Fhjra required the study and comparison of the many collections which in earlier times had been sent over from America to the European herbaria.
In Glasgow he was the guest of Dr. W. J. Hooker.
Among these whom he met in England at this time were George Bentham, Roht.
Brown, Balfour, Lindley, Boott, Bauer, Lambert, Greville and a vscore of others.
Upon finishing his work in England he went to the Continent pushing his undertaking with great vigor.
In the course of his extended tour he visited Paris, Lyons, Vienna, Munich, Geneva, Halle, Berlin, Hamburg and other cities, and made the acquaintance of such men as Jussieu, Brongniart, Decaisne, IVIirbel, Adrien, Gaudichaud, Gay, Delile, Duval, Endlicher, von Martins, Zuccarini, the De Candolles, Ehrenberg, Schlechtendal, Klotzsch, Kunth, Link, Lehmann and many more.
It will be seen that in this, his first visit to Europe, he made the acquaintance of many botanists already eminent, and others who like himself were later to become so.
This was one of the most important years in his life.
Acquaintances were made which were life-long ; correspondences were opened and exchanges of plants and works begun which were alike helpful to all parties.
It must be admitted that in America Dr. Gray had no equal, but in Europe there were many who were working on kindred problems and to whom he might turn for scientific companionship.
L^pon returning home he prosecuted the work on the " Flora" with his accustomed energy and by the spring of 1841 had issued the first 184 pages of Vol.
II.
Passing over ten years of hard work in collecting, writing and teaching at Cambridge, we find him in June of 1850 in a sailing vessel for a second time on his way to Europe.
His object now was a study of the plants of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition.
After travelling in Switzerland, working for a time in DeCandolle's hei'barium at Geneva and visiting von Martins at Munich, he went with Mrs. Gray to the country place of Mr. George Bentham in Hertfordshire and spent two months there, going over in company with Mr. Bentham, the entire collection which had been sent out from America.
He next went to Sir "NVni.
Hooker's house at Kew, London, to study collections there.
A visit of six weeks to Paris with work in P. Barker Webb's herbarium and at the Jardin des Plantes was followed by nearly four months stay in London with study at the British Museum.
Robert Brown was then living.
For him Dr. Gray entertained the most profound respect, rating him as he ever after did, as one of the greatest of philosophical botanists.
In 1855 he made his third journey, visiting some of his old friends but remaining from home but six Meeks.
His fourth trip to Enghmd and the Continent ^vas made in 1868.
Between the years 1856, the date of the hist visit, and 1868 much valuable work had been done.
He had issued his "Structural and Morphological Botany" which had no rival in America, and no superior in Europe.
It was a model of clearness and conciseness in its methods of treating the general morphology of the plant and especially that of the flower.
The "Manual" had been published and was already recognized as worthy a place by the side of Koch's German Flora.
No higher praise could have been given to it.
The two JManuals were regarded as models of clearness and brevity in description.
The work, also that on the Flora of North America, had been constantly carried on, besides the jDublication of various papers on botanical subjects, the most important of which was: "Relation of the Japanese Flora to that of North America."
This had been a very remarkable piece of work, requiring close reasoning and comj^arisou, all the more remarkable because the geological and palaeontological work on the fossil flora of the North by Heer had then not been done.
The "Principles of Variation in Species" soon to be made known by Charles Darwin's " Origin of Species " was yet unpublished.
Both of these works might have given great help toward the solution of the problem in hand.
It is safe to say that this last work made him known to every active thinker in Europe.
What wonder is it then, that after the very successful issue of his valuable text-books, after many additions to the North American Flora and the publication of numerous papers including the last one mentioned on geographical distribution, this fourth visit abroad in 1868, should have been one continued ovation?
Leaving home in September he spent this and the following autumn at Kew, hard at work.
In the interim, visiting Paris, he renewed old acquaintances ; worked with von Martius in JNIunich and with DeCandolle in Geneva, and visited various herbaria all over the Continent before returning to England.
So:nething of the high regard in which his scientific labors were held at this time may be gathered from the fact that when he sailed for home in 1869 he had been made a member of nearly every Royal Scientific Society in Europe.
He was in Europe twice after this ; first in 1880, remaining about a year.
He visited Paris, the Herbarium at Madrid, Spain, most of the Italian herbaria and then settled down at Kew for hard work, receiving plants for comparison from many of the German and other continental herbaria.
Some time was, however, given to the visiting of old friends.
The last visit to Europe was made in April, 1887, returning in October of same year.
A little work was done at Kew, and the Lamarck Herbarium at the Jardin des Plantes was carefully examined.
Otherwise the time was devoted to pleasant travel and old friends.
Returning in October, he had planned among other work the writing of his Recollections of European Botanists.
Dr. Gray was known both in England and on the continent not alone as a botanist, but as one of the ablest exponents of evolution.
In the early times after the publication of the " Origin of Species " he was its most out-spoken defender in America.
His articles at this time were often copied by the English journals.
He did not accept the theory in its entirety.
Many letters of Darwin's attest how fully the latter relied on his judgment and support — Darwin .says in one of his letters to Dr. Gray " you never touch the subject without making it clearer," " I look at it as even more extraordinary that you never say a word or use an epithet which does not fully express my meaning," "others who perfectly understand my book, yet sometimes use expressions to which I demur."
And again in the same letter he writes " I hope and almost believe that the time will come when you will go further, in believing a much larger amount of modification of species, than you did at first or do noAV."
When the history of the development theory is written no small part will be given to him whom we commemorate.
More than one continental botanist has had reason to venerate our teacher and leader in botany fully as much as Mr. Darwin.
His criticism and kindly advice was freely given when asked and often proved invaluable.
Prof Thomas Meehan remarked that he desired to dwell somewhat more fully upon a trait of Dr. Gray's character which the previous speakers had touched only incidentally.
The whole world of science owed a debt to Dr. Gray for his botanical labors ; but he was not sure but the greater debt was due to his un])ublished work, namely his kind helpfulness to other workers.
Many had been made scientific students, many had even become eminent in usefulness, solely by the early encouragement received from Dr. Gray.
If he might bepardoned for referring to his own history, he would say that few have had better opportunity of knowing Dr. Gray in this respect than he himself.
In 1857, at the instance of a friend he was led to open a correspondence with Dr. Gray upon the constant differences between the European and American forms of Sjniaea salicifolia.
Nothing could be kinder than the reply which urged him to continue his observations, saying that former authors had made the American form a distinct species under the name of S. carpinifolia and that Dr. Gray jiiight probably adopt this name in the next edition of the Manual.
The subsequent appearance of Darwin's "Origin of Species" so changed the hitherto prevailing idea of specific types that it is no wonder that it did not appear in the next edition under a distinct name.
But the encouragement given to the obscure young man was not lost.
It led to a closer observation of similar phenomena, and the paper on the relative characters of American and European species, which subsequently received the approval of Darwin, Mivart and others, was the result of the encouragement given in that letter.
That and many subsequent papers were submitted to Dr. Gray before publication, and not presented without his approval ; and it was not till later, after he had caught up with the whole literature of the subject, that he ventured to stand alone without the aid of his early friend and monitor.
Prof. Meehan then spoke of his long and frequent correspondence with Dr. Gray, growing out of his own editorial position.
From month to month Dr. Gray would send his criticisms upon his editorial work.
These were occasionally sharp and adverse, but always judicious, encouraging and kind, and Mr. Meehan cited many instances illustrative of this.
It was characteristic of Dr. Gray to give the same attention to the poorest and most obscure, as to the most prominent, if only he found them to be earnest searchers for truth.
It had been said that he was hard to convince, but this was because he himself had taken so much pains to reach the truth.
Nothing but positive evidence would lead him to set aside a conclusion at which he had arrived ; but when once such evidence was produced, no one accepted it more readily or gracefully, and hence he was even more merciless in judging of his own work, than that of others.
Of this readiness to reverse his own decisions, and do justice to others, Prof. Meehan gave many pleasant instances.
Few men could have a warmer heart towards friends than Dr. Gray — but this did.
not lead him to igiiore their faults, nor jirevent him from expressing his A'ieAvs of them.
Tender, loving and considerate as he always was, he could be caustic and severe when he believed the good of science demanded it.
Once a very zealous collector to whom science was under many obligations, described and published a large number of plants, from imperfect material, with undue haste and without competent knoAvledge.
Dr. Gray had to show that really there were very few new species among them, and in so doing his criticism was unusually severe.
Mr. Meehan in writing to Dr. Gray ventured to remonstrate with him upon the severity which he had used.
The reply was, " In my heart, I would have been more tender than you, but I cannot afford to be.
I am, from my position before the world, a critic, and I cannot shrink from the duty Avhich such a position imposes upon me.
If you were in the position that I am, witli a short life and a long task before you, and just as you chought the way was clear for progress, some one should dump cart loads of rubbish in your path, and you had to take off your coat, roll uj) your sleeves and spend weeks in digging that rubbish away befoi'e you could proceed, I should not suppose you would be a model of amiability."
In giving these recollections Prof. Meehan hoped that he should be pardoned for so much allusion to his own history, but it was because that history bore such full and rich testimony to the critical acumen, the kind judgment, the friendly aid and the warm and loving heart of the man as well as the scientist, whom we this evening commemorate.
Mr. Isaac C. Martindale then spoke of Professor Gray's encouragement to young students, and of his willingness always to aid them in their studies ; this he was able to testify from his own experience, having been again and again assisted while engaged with perplexing botanical problems: he also spoke of the genial, kind and social dispi-sition ever displayed, and which made the name of Professor Gray a household word in so many homes.
He gave an interesting account of a botanical excursion to the mountains of North Carolina made in 1884 in company with this greatest of American botanists, referring to the readiness with which he I'ecalled the names of all the ])lants met with during the journey, showing not only his perfect familiarity with the names of the species but also his most remarkable memory.

On the resevihlanee of the primitive foravibiifera and of ovarian Ova.
— Prof. Ryder remarked that upon cutting sections of nearly mature ovarian ova with their investing membrane, zona radiata, in place, it was found that, in quite a number of cases, fine protoplasmic processes or pseudopods extended from the peripheral layer of protojilasm of the e.gg, through its capsule or zona and joined the cells of the granulosa or discus proligerus.
This arrangement reminded one forcibly of the filamentous pseudppods extended from a Heliozoon or of the slender pseudopods extended through the perforations in the walls of the single chambers of Glohigerina.
This resemblance was all the more suggestive if one will compare a section of one of the chambers of a Glohigerina made through the calcareous shell and its contained protoplasm with a similar section through the ovum of the Gar Pike, where the zona is formed of pillars of homogenous matter.
Such prolongations of pseudopods through the investing zona radiata in the case of many species of animal forms, shows fairly well that this must be the principal means by which new matter is taken up from without and incorporated, as there is no direct extension of the vascular system into the egg, by which it can take up nutriment.
It is thus seen that the early stages of the growing ovum, not only resemble some of the lower forms of Helizoa and Foraminifera as respects the grade of their morphological differentiation but also as to the mode in which they exhibit their nutritive or physiological activities.
This resemblance is still further heightened if a form like OrhuUna is compared with certain stages of the development of ova.
It is thus seen that, in many cases, the ovarian germ, at least, passes through a stage which may be morphologically as well as physiologically compai-ed with some of the lowest 2:rades of the Protozoa.
b^ Chaetopterus from Florida: — Prof Leidy directed attention to specimens which were collected in the trip of Prof Heilprin and Mr. Willcox, at the mouth of the Manatee River.
The species appears to be the Chaetopterus pergamentaceus of Cuvier, originally desci'ibed from specimens from the AVest Indies.
It is a remarkable form.
It belongs to the Tubicolae or tube-living worms, but unlike most of these, is devoid of the numerous cephalic appendages, or tentacles and gills.
The tube is membranous and laminated in structure and it has the appearance of parchment.
The two tubes collected are 16 inches long by fths of an inch in diameter, and tapering towards the ends.
An incomplete worm, not well preserved •on account of its delicacy, in its present condition is 9 inches long, 6 and appears very narrow in comparison with the capacity of its tube.
The anterior division of tlie body, about an inch long, is flattened, and about half as wide, but narrowing behind, and is composed of eight podal segments provided with dense bunches of lustrous, golden setae.
The succeeding segment, long and narrow, is provided with a pair of wing-like appendages an inch long, and each furnished with two bundles of diverging setae.
Then follow five long narrow segments with large membranous appendages, without setae.
The^ terminal segments, of which 15 remain in the specimen, are furnished with pairs of long pointed appendages with bundles of setae.

Necessity for Revising the Nomenclature of Avierican Spiders.
— Dr., McCoOK remarked that during the summer of 1887, while visiting the Zoological Library of the British Museum of Natural History, he gained information which may revolutionize, or at least compel a radical revision of the nomenclature of American spiders.
His interest in these animals being known by some of the zoologists in the room, his attention was called to a volume of unpublished figures of American spiders then in the library.
These drawings were made by Mr. John Abbot, an Englishman settled in Savannah during the latter part of the eighteenth century.
The figures were made as early as 1792.
At least they bear that date.
Mr. Abbot is well known to entomologists by his work upon lepidoptera, published in connection with Mr. Smith.
^ This book proved to be the volumes, long supposed to be lost, of original drawings from which Baron Walckenaer described the numerous species from Georgia which are found rn his Natural History of Apterous Insects.^ 1 "The Natural History of the rarer lepidopterous insects of Georgia.
Including their systematic characters, the particulars of their several metamorphoses and the plants on which they feed.

It was known, of course, from Walckenaer's introduction to his descriptions that he had purchased Abbot's' drawings of over five hundred species of spiders and other arachnids; that he also had the manuscript drawings made by Bosc of South Carolina spiders.
But Americans seem to have been in ignorance of what had become of these drawings, and the fact that they were in the Zoological Library appears to have escaped the observation of the little circle of British students of araneads; at least the speaker could recall no reference made to them in current literature.
It was not until the above incident that an American student was known to have a clew to the whereabouts of the valuable volume which the British Museum is so fortunate as to possess.^ How the book happened to come into its present place, or in what manner it was procured from Baron Walckenaer or his executors.
Dr. McCook was not able to say.
On the day when the discovery was made, he had engagements which prevented him giving more than an hour or two to the study of the figures, and as he was about to leave London, no further opportunity presented for making extended notes.
However, he was able at once to recognize a number of species which have long and familiarly been known under the names published by Hentz.
He took notes of a number of these species, principally among the orbweavers, a group with which he was at })resent particularly engaged.
He also took the numbers under which the figures are listed by Abbot.
After returning to America Dr. McCook went over Walckenaer's descriptions, comparing them witli his own notes, and found that there is no doubt at all as to the identity of these drawings with the original ones from which Walckenaer described his published species.
The number of Abbot's figures as they appear in the manuscripts correspond with the numbers cited by Walckenaer in his references to the same.
Moreover, Walckenaer's descriptions, viewed in the light of the speaker's recollection of the drawings, together with his own notes and identification on the spot, remove all doubt as to the identity of at least a considerable number of the species.
The importance of this discovery is seen in view of the following facts: Walckenaer published his descriptions of Georgia species in 1837; Professor Hentz, the father of American Araneology, made his publications in the Proceedings and Journal of the Boston Society of Natural History beginning with the year 1841, and continued until 1850.
The latter have been gathered together and ^ Walckenaer erroneously refers to the author as "Thomas" Abbot; his name is "John."

Zoological Library of the British Museum of Natural History, London.
published in book form under the title of "The Spiders of the United States," edited by Edward Burgess and with notes by Mr. Emerton.^ Hentz had some previous papers of no very great consequence, and in 1835 he published a simple list of 125 species arranged under the gehera to which he supposed that they belonged.
This was in the Second Edition of Hitchcock's Report of the Geology of Massachusetts, (1835.)
An examination of this list shows that it includes a number of the species which Walckenaer described in 1837 from the drawings of Abbot.
So far then as the bai-e publication of these names is concerned Hentz has a priority of two years.
The question of priority involved is yet more complicated by the fact that the second volume of Walckenaer's work, containing many of the American sj)ecies and all the orbweavers, bears a date whose integrity is seriously questioned.
The title page gives "1837" as the year of publication, the same as that i-ightly borne by the first volume; but Dr. T. Thorell, who is one of the highest living authorities in Araneology, declares that this volume "did not come out till 1841.
"'^ This fact, however, does not seriously effect the points in issue, as only a few species of the Mygalidae were published by Hentz in 1841;'' all the remaining species were published during and subsequent to 1842.
The attitude of American students of spider fauna toward Walckenaer's descriptions alluded to above has been something after the fashionof the famous Scotch verdict "not proven."
In other words, in the absence of any types or specimens anywhere existing to which his descriptions might be referre"cl; in the absence of the original drawings from which his descriptions were made, for none (or only one) of them were made from the specimens themselves ; and in the absence of any knowledge as to whether those drawings anywhere existed, it was generally conceded, so far as there was any thought or action on the matter at all, that Walckenaer's descriptions must be considered as non-existent.
The priority, therefore, of all the descriptions made by Hentz has been heretofore universally allowed, even thougli some of Walckenaer's descriptions are sufficiently clear to show without the aid of figures that he had in mind the same species covered under different names by Hentz.
Dr. McCook believed that on the whole this decision was a righteous one, and that up to this date no claim could have been established in favor of Walckenaer's priority.
However, a question now arises which it is necessary to face and in some way settle.
Does not the discovery of the original drawings in the Zoological Library of the British Museum put an entirely ' Boston : Boston Society of Natural History, 1875.

Shall we not be compelled, in view of the fact that tiiere can now be no doubt of the identity of Walckenaer's species, to give the priority to him ?
The very few American students of our spider fauna have become • so familiar with many of Walckenaer's species under Hentz's names, that it will be difficult to throw those names out of mind.
Moreover they have entered into all our literature up to this date, and there will be o-reat confusion in makino; the corrections.
Besides, it must be allowed that Hentz's names are better chosen then Walckenaer's.
If Abbot, whose patient, long continued and intelligent labors deserve the real honor, could receive the credit of entitulation, one migiit, at least on the ground of sentiment, feel more reconciled to seeing the priority pass from flentz; especially as Baron Walckenaer was often indifferent to the prior rights of fellow naturalists.
But the laws of priority must be considered, and honesty and justice can give no room for considerations of convenience and sentiment.
Many of Walckenaer's descriptions may be considered as fairly good, and indeed they have all along been recognized as clearly Covering some of Hentz's species.
But when those descriptions are placed alongside of Abbot's drawings, from which they were made, all doubt is removed as to the identity.
For the most part, Abbot's drawings are tolerably accurate, Avell finished, are colored after nature, and there was no difficulty at first sight in identifying a large number of our well known species, under the names published bv Professor Hentz.
It seems unfortunate that such good work should have remained so long unnoticed, and that credit for the same should liave been so wholly lost to the author.
It is at least some satisfaction to be able to render such justice and honor as this notice may bring, to one who barely escaped the distinction of being the father of American araneology by inability to publish or procure the publication of his faithful labors.
There are thus raised very delicate points as to the law of priority, concerning which Dr. McCook desired to obtain the judgment of his associates: — first, in view of the fact that Walckenaer's species were described not from the spiders themselves, but from the drawings of them made by another hand, can we be permitted to give priority to Hentz, whose descriptions were made from the animals themselves?
Second, does the fact that two years previous to Walckenaer's descriptions, Hentz published the names of one hundred and twenty five sjiecies.
manv of which are identical with those of Abbot's drawings and Walckenaer's descriptions, entitle the American author to priority as to these species?
Under ordinary circumstances it would perhaps be at once admitted that Hentz could have no claim, but in view of the special circumstances alluded to may there not be some departure from the strict construction of the lex prloritaiist The inconvenience of overthrowing Hentz's names would be a peculiar hardship to American araneologists, unless the original or a fac-simile of Abl)ot's Drawings could be obtained and made accessible on this side of the Atlantic.
With the book in the British Museum, there is no final court, before wliicli to test the integrity of species, avaiUible for the bulk of American students.
While Walckenaer's descriptions are generally intelligible with the drawings in hand, many are obscure without them.
This is equally true of Hentz's descriptions; but then we have his figures to interpret the descriptions sufficiently well to enable us to identify the species.
* Dr. McCook presented a list of a few of the best known species, especially among the orb weavers, of those which were recognized by him as identical with the corresponding uumliers in Abbot's drawings, and which, if Walckenaer's claim to priority be conceded, must hereafter be known under the names assigned by that naturalist.
A reading of this brief list will give araneologists some idea of the serious labor that must be wrought by them before fixed and satisfactory results can be evolved from the confusion into which our existing nomenclature has been startled by the unexpected reappearance of Abbot's long lost manuscripts.
These species are here given in the following tabulated form.
The first column shows the name given by Hentz.
The second shows Walckenaer's names.
The third column gives the names of the species as thev must hereafter be known if Walckenaer's names are to be accepted.

*In the discussion which followed the remarks of Dr. McCook the opinion was expressed by Professors Leidy, Lewis and Dall that the earlier names should in all cases be adopted, no matter how much inconvenience might be entaded thereby, if the descriptions were recognizable.
Prof. Heilprin held that such cases should be decided so as to cause the least embarrassment to naturalists and therefore the least detriment to Science.
