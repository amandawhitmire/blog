RHOADS.', 'With the idea of investigating the avifauna of the southern border of the United States and collectiug a series of the birds of Florida Texas and Arizona I left Philadelphia March 26th 1891 arriving at Jacksonville Florida on the fifth of the following month.', 'A sojourn of five weeks was made in the southwestern part of the state and considerable collections obtained.', 'Few facts additional to what has been already written on the bird life of this region were ascertained and it is not my intention to treat in detail of this part of the trip.', \"I arrived at Corpus Christi Texas May 17th and here a three weeks' stay was made.\", 'I then journeyed westward to Tucson Arizona arriving on the tenth of June and collecting birds in the immediate vicinity until the nineteenth.', 'That morning I took stage for Oracle a posthamlet situated in the oak belt forty miles north ward among the foothills of the Catalina Mountains.', 'Collecting Avas carried on in that vicinity until July 2nd Avhen the mountains were ascended and I took up my abode for a week in a lumber camp among the pines of Mt.', 'Lemon at an elevation of between 7000 and 8000 ft. and about 2000 feet below the summit of that mountain.', 'The birds of southern Texas especially those in the vicinity of Corpus Christi have received no small amount of attention from naturalists.', 'Mr. Beckham enumerates eight publications bearing directly on this subject prior to his own which appeared in 1887.', 'Within a few months Mr. Chapman has published a paper giving the results of his observations made on exactly the same ground which I covered three weeks later.', 'In fact I was conducted by Mr. Priour who acted as my guide to the same collecting grounds in the immediate vicinity of Corpus Christi and along the Nueces River and 1 Mr. Rhoads has generously presented his entire collection numbering about one thou.sand skins to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.', 'The Texas series numbers 23\\nspecimens and the Arizona collection 398.', \"Owing to Mr. Rhoads' absence from Philadelphia when preparing this paper he was unable to make a critical examination of the specimens and at his request I have added utiles on such as exhibited any peculiarities  these annotations are followed by my initials.\", 'Witmer Stone.', '2 Proc.', 'U. S. Nat.', 'Mus.', 'Vol.', '10 p. 683.', 'Bull.', 'Am.', 'Mus.', 'Nat.', 'Hist.', 'Vol.', 'Ill No.', '3.', 'Bay svliich lie had previously visited with Mr. Chapman.', 'The interval between our visits however gave opportunity for a decided readjustment of the bird fauna due to migration and the nesting of resident species.', \"Mr. Beckham's personal observations of Texan birds terminated in March and so far as I can discover very few if any of our observers have recorded data relating to the early summer birds of the Corpus Christi region Dresser's summer notes relating chiefly to the vicinity of San Antonio\\nFurther description of the region included in the following notes would be superfluous after all that the aforementioned authors have written on the subject.\", 'Before proceeding with the annotated list hoAvever the following observations may be made.', \"Though nearly all the nonresident birds had passed through and a drouth existed quite equal in severity to that prevailing during Mr. Beckman's stay my experience agrees with that of Mr. Chapman  birds were abundant everywhere.\", 'Nearly half of the birds observed were feeding their young before my departure and in many cases the fullfledged young Avere procured.', 'This rendered all the more conspicuous the fact that many boreal species especially among the water birds still lingered.', 'I received corroboration in various ways that the annual overstepping of fauual limits by many species belonging to a more southerly district and their subsequent disappearance toward the end of the spring migration is a marked feature at Corpus Christi.', 'These birds undoubtedly return in due time to their ancestral haunts in Mexico ere the breeding season begins.', 'To what extent this movement due undoubtedly to the sexual excitability and ignorance of the country exhibited by birds of the first year should be held to account for the  faunal inosculation  which Beckham speaks of I am unable t prove.', 'From all that may be proven by and inferred from the observations of collectors in this region ten years ago it seems that several species are now represented in the avifauna of Corpus Christi which were then strangers to it.', 'Owing to the position of this territory forming as it were the keystone of three great faunal arches eastern western and southern where in time past the birds from their respective regions approached so nearly that a slight change in physical or climatic conditions would precipitate more intimate relations.', 'Precisely such a state of affairs has happened and the intermingling of races and species on new territory has become permanent.', 'In seeking a cause for this I am led to the belief that it is due chiefly to the introduction of cattle.', 'When we remember that the growth of dense mesquite chaparral which now forms such a marked feature in the landscape of southeastern Texas and is steadily encroaching upon the tithe of open prairie yet remaining is directly due to the grazing of immense herds of cattle which have in their search for subsistence robbed the prairie fire of its fuel and at the same time distributed the seeds of mesquite and other arborescent shrubs this statement may not appear as paradoxical as it seems.', 'The comparatively sudden conversion of many square miles of debatable ornithological ground from prairie to brushland in this manner would aflbrd just such inducements to arboreal birds in the further extension of their winter range from the north and their summer range from the south as now exist.', 'On the other hand as the true prairie lands diminish the more strictly plainhaunting species must disappear.', 'A comparison of the relative abundance of the species noted by Beckham as compared with the same observed this year by Mr. Chapman and myself tends to prove this.', \"Even in 1887 the date of Beckham's observations.\", 'Dr. Havard reports the mesquite as  shrubby  and Beckham characterizes it as  a dreary waste of cactus etc.', 'The growth of mesquite in the surrounding country even since then will tally well with the faunal changes recorded for it must be borne in mind that until say seven years ago the overstocking of pasture with cattle and the consequent efiect upon a previously superabundant pasturage did not aflTect the country far from city limits  so that beyond a comparatively small area surrounding the city the virgin prairie retained its original features.', 'For this reason birds were scarce not so much because of drouth but for lack of shelter and food suited to those of arboreal habits.', 'Many insectivorous birds are found breeding in localities where water is unobtainable save in the form of dew and owing to the juicy nature of their food they can most likely enjoy life indefinitely without the luxury of a drink.', 'It seems therefore probable that the late increase of passerine birds in this part of Texas is due not to an excess of rainfall or to the absence of droughts in late years but to the vast extension of treecovered areas into the prairie and the increase of insect and vegetable food resulting from this cause  and these conditions apply not only to the increase of individuals among old forms but equally to the additional species now ascribed to the Corpus Christi fauna.', 'The subjoined list includes all birds observed by me those species of which I did not obtain specimens being indicated by an asterisk.', 'I wish here to acknowledge my grateful indebtedness to Mr. Witmer Stone Conservator of the Ornithological Section of the Academy of

enough to make with the aid of a glass an excellent survey of the flocks in the act of feeding before they noticed our jiresence.', 'When within about two hundred yards of them the whole company of four or five hundred individuals simultaneously raised their heads and faced about.', 'On approaching some fifty yards nearer the sudden righting about just mentioned was succeeded by a most interesting series of manoeuvres consisting of a contraction and filling in of all the gaps in the line  and just as this was completed with a rush of wiugs aud a glorious burst of color they arose.',

December or whether there is merely a wearing away of the tips of the feathers as in Agelaius and other birds.', 'The Spoonbills now leave the vicinity of Corpus Christi the latter part of February and though a few stragglers sometimes remain all the year none have been known to breed on the Texas coast of late years.', \"This state of affairs is probably due to their persecution and to the destruction of the forests between Corjus Christi and Brownsville which used to reach nearer the river mouths affording this formerly abundant species suitable rookery sites.'\", 'It is probable that most of the flock of birds seen on Nueces Bay were raised somewhere on the coast south of Brownsville.', 'After raiinotheir young in comparative safety they return yearly to this spot to spend the
