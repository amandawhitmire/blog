In the spring of 2021, I was notified that I have been awarded a fellowship through the LEADING program^[The [*LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING)*](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/leading/), is a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian (LB21) National Digital Infrastructures and Initiatives project, supported by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/) (IMLS). The LEADING project scales-up the highly successful [LEADS-4-NDP](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/research/leads/) initiative and will prepare a diverse, nation-wide cohort of 50 LIS doctoral students and early to mid-career librarians for data science endeavors.], an [IMLS](https://imls.gov/)-funded initiative to bring data science skills into academic libraries. This page is a bridge to a blog, where I will document and share the work I'll be doing for my fellowship project, loosely titled, "From natural history literature to linked open data biodiversity knowledge graph."

My fellowship project is housed under the [Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University](https://ansp.org/), and will be using the [Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/6885) as a corpus for text-mining. This project seeks to augment existing biodiversity specimen collection data by linking related descriptions found in the rich tradition of natural history literature. 

I'll be sharing the process and outputs of my fellowship, which runs July - December 2021, via [this here blog](https://amandawhitmire.github.io/blog/).
