```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Update 2!

The Streamlit app is [ALIVE](https://share.streamlit.io/amandawhitmire/streamlit-ansp/app.py) on the Internet! It's ... not so stable, but you can play with it. 

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandawhitmire/blog/main/images/streamlit_app.jpg")
```

You can upload a text file or paste in text, and you can download your results. 

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandawhitmire/blog/main/images/download_button.jpg")
```

Keep in mind that the set of habitat entities are from [Nguyen et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.7.e29626) & the taxonomic names were mined from the ANSP corpus using @GlobalNames GNfinder. If you upload non-ANSP text, some taxonomic names will get missed. Also try to avoid uploading big files - Streamlit gets cranky about that. Have fun!

## Update! 

While the Streamlit app is not yet launched to run on the web, I have it up and running on a local host. Since you can't visit the site yourself, I recorded a quick tour (on a Friday afternoon, forgive my slow brain).

Click image below to see a 2-minute video that introduces a beta version of a Streamlit App that uses spaCy and applies custom NER entities for taxonomic names and habitats.
